But as for a Doctor Who MMO, this isn't how it should be done. It should be you playing as a Pre-Time War Time Lord, fighting against threats such as the Daleks and the Cybermen. There would be two factions; Paragon Time Lords, who would have normal Time Lord names, like Rassilon and Arkytior, and would have to follow Time Lord law, and Renegade Time Lords, who would haves names like The Doctor and The Master. When you die a certain amount of times, you regenerate. Once you regenerate, your stats get messed up a bit, and your morality changes. You can earn extra regenerations as a reward from the Time Lords by fighting certain threats. OH! And you can explore your TARDIS completely. As in, you could find the supposed pool. And the Chameleon Circuit would work. Planets would include the likes of Gallifrey, Skaro, Earth, Mondas, Raxicoricofallapotorius, Sontar, Marinus, the Library, the Ood Sphere, and many more.

One uses the belief that the Pandorica exists, the other uses the belief that the Doctor dies on that date to create a fixed point.

true,strolls,null,null,"A customer of mine in Shenley Lodge got BT Infinity. He got it on a second line, so when it was first installed he could switch between it and his old ADSL connection (Eclipse Internet, c 3meg). Although Infinity clocked in fast on speedtests, web-pages loaded visibly slower.

Car analogy: top speed may have no reflection on acceleration. 

Note that the BT ""unlimited"" on that table does have a ""fair usage policy"". 

AAISP are not cheap, but they're *very* good. They require you to buy monthly usage ""blocks"", e.g. 1 unit might get you 100MB per month 9 - 5 usage. If you can limit your daytime usage, you can buy 1TB of off-peak (midnight to 6am) usage for £3. I find this very fair and transparent.

Plus.net also have a good reputation. My mother is with them, and they recently managed to get Openreach (BT Wholesale) to dig up the pavement in her street to replace her line and solve her connection (line sync) issues. She'd been having problems for years, and we'd made a handful of half-hearted attempts to get it resolved with her previous ISP, but I always told her it was a lost cause until she chose a reputable ISP because I wasn't going to spend hours on the phone to a call-centre getting jerked around. Plus.net were quite professional and we had the issue resolved within a few weeks.

I use Eclipse and their tech support is very good, too (AAISP are probably better, but perhaps not enough to make much difference). I've been with them for years, and I can recommend them without real reservations. Not sure about their fibre services, but I get unlimited use midnight to 9am, so I just installed the scheduler plugin for deluge and leave it running. I also schedule iPlayer downloads and so, even as a heavy internet surfer, I never exceed 100meg daytime usage.

It's like watching Commissioner Gordon against a band of the Joker's thugs. The conflict just doesn't seem all that relevant in comparison to the bigger picture.

I guess this is where we differ. I like seeing things in different scales. I don't care how big the stakes are if it makes for a good story. The appeal of Torchwood is that: it's a different scale from The Doctor, and a different way of looking at familiar or similar scenarios. Take the Cyberwoman episode, for example. Yeah, it's pretty bad, but that's the execution. It's still a really good premise behind it, to explore how a normal person feels when their significant other is turned into a Cybermen. Since that emotion is the intended focus, it doesn't matter that The Doctor has faced much larger threats or a lot more Cybermen. It's not about that. I would argue that a series about River would be too similar to the main show and therefore woefully redundant.

By the way, as an aside, a few years ago there was a series called Gotham Central that's exactly what you described: about regular GCPD cops going against not even necessarily Batman villains, but crime in Gotham in general. Batman very rarely appears on the page, and it's mostly stuff like ""what happens to the mind of a random person who was once mindcontrolled by The Mad Hatter years ago"" or ""how does a woman cope with the fact that her husband was one of the cops Mr. Freeze froze to death during one of his crime sprees."" And yeah, one of the issues had them rounding up and interrogating Joker's clown henchmen in order to find him. It was the best book DC was putting out when it was around. So I actually think your analogy is fitting; I just disagree that it's not interesting.",0,1318022868,null,0,false,0,c2pphs4,t3_l4fll,t1_c2pphs4,t3_l4fll,1427701013,6,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,6

true,strolls,null,null,"&gt; Calling out BT engineers for line problems costs £120 - which is waived if they can identify and fix a specific problem. Be didn't provide me with any info I'd need to give the engineer, so were essentially saying ""Ring BT, pay them a hundred quid, you might get lucky"". 

Be were shirking their responsibility on that one. I've had multiple ISPs call out Openreach (BT Wholesale) numerous times, and never had to pay for it (with the one exception of a building too old to have a proper master socket - that cost £40 or so).

Recently Plus.net got Openreach to dig up the pavement in my mum's street, and lay her a new line from the cabinet to her house. It took a bit of patience, and numerous BT guys out before they actually escalated it to the roadworks crew, but not much difficulty.

ISPs love to threaten the £120 charge, because it does stitch them up if you lie to them about testing with a different router in the master test-socket. But if there's a line problem it is *their responsibility* to get Openreach to fix it. You should be able to force their hand with a strongly- and well-worded letter, although I appreciate that you shouldn't have to and not everyone wants the hassle.

Chris Scott has spent a lot of time in morocco, mauritania, and mali amongst other places. he also has quite an up to date page about visas and the like.  His book Sahara Overland 2 is worth buying.

We took black and white copies, because they are cheaper, the hotels don't need color copies, and i think there is a rule of about having color photo copies.

forgot to mention morocco is all about catching you out with speeding, they hide in the bushes and set random speed limits around the place. so watch out, you can get car innsurance for morroco normally under Green Flag which is an extension of your UK innsurance. make sure you hav it as they will ask you about it when you get caught for speeding. trying to explain that it is on the internet is not easy. 

it is worth looking up overland websites and emailing people who have done the trip and asking them questions, i did plenty of that and especially useful is if they are still on the trip.

true,Irongate,uk,"Walthamstow, London","Bibs has the right of it. I think the biggest things about London are probably culture and convenience - the city has everything you need really, and you're never much more than an hour (by public transport) from anywhere you want to go. Whether that be a university, a museum, a cinema, an Canadian bar, you name it. The cost of living is higher in the city, yeah, but if you try living in what pass for the suburbs and you buy your food, etc. from the right places... well... it's affordable. 

As for finding work, I think being from overseas can actually help you in the right circumstances. I know a good few Australians and Americans who've been snapped up to work in pubs - just because punters like a touch of the exotic (bet you never thought of yourself as exotic though, eh?).

* [Rich Tea](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rich_tea) are your standard biscuit but they can get soggy if your not quick.


* [Digestives](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digestive_biscuit) are a bit more middle class but


* [hob knobs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hob_Nobs) are like the marines of dunking biscuits. 

Pete kay explains it better :-)

The tradeoff is, I can get the parts and sublimation print them myself and *sell them for $5*. I checked into engraving, at the cost to me, I'd have to sell them for $18-$20 to be worth it, unless I got like 1000 made at once (if you know someone who actually works at an engraving shop, they could do it a lot cheaper, I just don't want to buy an engraving machine to make one product).

So there are two options that approximate what they used on the show at a reasonable price for a novelty name tag, or one option that would be super-awesomely identical, but also make it a much more ""exclusive"" item.

Carra is more then just a player on the pitch at the moment with Gerrard out. He spends more time pointing and barking directions then he does defending.

It's the ""I don't want to think, so this is bad writing"" mentality. I got halfway through reading about his complaints on the astronaut suit and just couldn't finish it.

The astronaut suit provided three purposes. First of all it contained River Song, since she did not want to kill the Doctor(As was clear at the end of Closing Time, and the beginning of TWoRS). Secondly, it acted as a weapon. It was a weapon capable of killing the Doctor. Third, it had to be those circumstances to cause a fixed point, *as The Doctor explained in TWoRS*.

The first two points don't really need to be directly addressed, and the third WAS directly addressed. Also, since I just recently started watching Sherlock:

[A Study in Pink spoiler](/s ""Everyone took the pill because they thought they were being forced by gunpoint. They could either take the pill, which would be a supposed 50/50 chance, or get shot, a 100% chance. This also was explained in the show, and that Sherlock was the only person to realize the gun wasn't actually a gun."")

Their entire relationship consists of 'hey, remember that thing we did?' much like Anakin and Obi-Wan. Furthermore, the 'fixed point' is still wishy-washy, exactly because of what you say - it has to be three points that have to happen on the beach. This is bad storytelling, arguably, because we're just told that it has to happen that way and the only reason the characters are acting as they do is to make sure that happens, just because it needs to happen and not because there are any consequences involved.

As far as nitpicking real stuff, I only really didn't like how Moffat lied to us saying that the Tesselectica was the 'real Doctor'.

true,TheShader,mcgann,Defeated Cpt. Kirk,"I'm not really going to get too much into anything, but I honestly believe that the beginning season Doctor was NOT the Teselecta. I think he really did die there. Then, through the journeys we see him go through, he realizes that he can trick history. That, as he himself stated, history only has to acknowledge his death. Just like in Water of Mars. It wasn't the woman's death that was necessarily the fixed point, but that history stated she died, which caused her daughter(granddaughter?)to explore space. History wasn't keen on the particulars of how she died, but that her granddaughter would know of it, and use it as motivation to go to the stars.

Now, I don't really have anything to back this up. I'm really just going off of the fact that Moffat said it was, in fact, The Doctor that was shot and killed during The Impossible Astronaut. I fully agree that this is a point that could, and should, have had further clarification. 

I think the easiest explanation, at least one that I would have used in Moffat's place, is that The Doctor didn't initially meet the Teselecta.  In the original timeline he didn't know about his own death, which would have made him more cautious during Let's Kill Hitler. When we saw it, he knew his death was a fixed point, thus knew he wouldn't die in Berlin. So, not knowing he would die, he was more keen to avoid River's kiss, which in turn stopped the whole chase scene, and the Teselecta wouldn't have had the encounter near the end. Thus, no Teselecta to save The Doctor.

Not trying to 'fanwank' or anything. I'm saying that this is how I would have fit it in. Although, to be fair to Moffat, I have no idea where I would actually fit this. I imagine him squeezing it into the finale somewhere, and everyone complaining that it's contrived/a last minute copout. Alternatively, it's not like you could make a Let's Kill Hitler 2 that is exactly the same, but shows the original timeline. And even if it was in a throwaway line, how would The Doctor even be aware that he originally never met him? I believe there's Time lord technology that was capable of showing split timelines like this, but I don't think Doctor has ever been shown to have any of it in the new series.

TL;DR I don't think it was originally the Doctor, but your guess is as good as mine. I would have at least released a statement explaining the variant timelines, but who knows.

true,PhoBWanKenobi,mcgann,McGann,"I love her because she's a well-acted iconic female character who is also educated and capable of holding her own in an adventure. She's problematic in some ways--the whole femme fatale model isn't always so great for the feminismz, and Moffat has some funny ideas about men and women and marriage and stuff--but I find her interesting. As she's developed, esp. through this season, I think we've gotten to see her complexity through younger versions of herself. Her actions in TWoRS really ARE selfish and horrible. She's really just hung up on the Doctor at that point--they're not in love. But he knows he comes to trust and respect her later, so he decides to trust her now. I'm curious to see how the last third or so--which would be her growth from the irritating, mugging Mels Pond into the woman we met in her first episode--plays out.

But I also really dig Alex Kingston as an actress, think she has fantastic chemistry with Matt Smith, and I love complex story arcs. And I'm a continuity junky. From what I can tell, Moffat's actually been really careful with River's storyline--more than I think people give him credit for (that's not to say that he had it all PLANNED; just that he seems to write her in a way that's faithful to the complex timing of her story)--and I appreciate that a lot. Basically, I liked this story when it was *The Time Traveler's Wife*, but I didn't like the characters as much. River and the Doctor are so much cooler.

I can understand why people don't like her. Hell, I haven't been the biggest Amy fan, but plenty of Whovians love her and I respect that. The only thing that gets to me is when people are all melodramatically weirded out by how ugly Alex Kingston supposedly is. I don't know if it's her age or what, but there's a lot of weird misogyny aimed at her. Which I just. Do. Not. Get. Woman is pretty traditionally attractive.

That opinion has slowly changed over the last few seasons as I've gotten to understand her better, and the last time I rewatched Silence in the Library/Forest of the Dead it was touching.

Yes.  Yes it is.  But that's all it turned out to be.  An idea.  At some point River said she dreaded the day she'd meet the Doctor and he would have no idea who she was, because they were moving in the opposite directions.  I loved that idea.  I fell in love with that idea.  I waited for that to come into play since the library.  But I got the feeling it was never thought through well.  I got the impression that every time we met her, we'd go back and back in her timeline, and eventually get to the point where she first meets the Doctor.  A completely 180 from the library.  She dreaded the day she'd meet the Doctor and not know, him, well that was the day he met her and she didn't know him.  

But that's not what we got.  Instead, River seems to appear at random timeline points.  There are complicated graphs of people trying to piece together what her timeline is, because it's seemingly random.  There is no bread trail to easily follow her.  If you wanted to follow River's adventures, you'd have to watch the episodes in a weird order, instead of backwards.

That wasn't as elegantly written as I thought.  Long story short, I get the feeling that the whole ""River Song has a complex timeline"" device wasn't as thought out as the writers let on, and now it's all jumbled and unfulfilling.

No not all, but if something is important enough for you to voice your opinion about you should at least take the time to learn something about it, even if, no **especially if** the topics/articles that are relevant to the conversation are contrary to your point of view. I am not asking you or anyone else to read every article or watch every single episode of Doctor Who ever made, but if you are going to comment on a specific episode or article maybe you should watch it or read it? That IMHO doesn't seem to be very burdensome.

You are honestly bringing ""reason"" into a discussion about a sci-fi TV show about an alien who ""theoretically"" could live to damn near infinity if he wanted to who travels through space, time, and dimensions?

Ocado gets easier, they remember what you bought previously, what you buy the most etc. Now my Ocado shops are pretty quick. I just go through the list of what I usually buy and add them then find anything else I want.

During the checkout process it'll list some of your usual items that aren't in your basket in case you've forgotten anything. It'll also give you some suggestions.

The mobile app is also excellent, one of the nice features is a barcode reader so you can just scan the items you want and it'll look them up.

If you like Ocado and want to use it more then you can get the delivery pass. I think it's 40quid for the first year (promotional, goes up the next year), then all deliveries are free as long as you spend 40quid or more.

&gt;Now calm down, and think about the situation logically.

Name calling?!? I'm not sure that phrase means what you think it means!  I think we're going down the road of patronising cod psychology here, which you're frankly not very good at.  It's never easy to infer people's emotions from text, and you've missed the mark here.  Stick to the arguments.

&gt;It is not immature to expect that after taking your money, a counterparty will provide you with the product you purchased. If they refuse, they have created a situation.

As I said, we don't know exactly what transpired.  You're making illogical inferences and speculating again.  This is not a particularly sensible, fair or logical way of finding out truth.  Without knowing the back story or the policies of the store, there may be any number of reasons why she couldn't get butter.  

&gt;Irrelevant. They don't even have to do their job well. They just need to provide their customers with the product.

Maybe the product doesn't come with butter, or maybe there's not butter available.  It's all speculation.  But in general, if something's not available at a store, it's not the server's fault; they are frequently bound by events, policies and conditions outside of their control, but they get the blame anyway thanks to immaturity and ignorance in customers.  That's one of the reasons why it's a hard job.  Customers can become aggressive and rude, even racist and abusive.  Of course this is relevant!

&gt;Yes they should. They are in public. You have no right to not be offended, at any age.

- I never said anyone had a right to not be (sic) offended.  Nor did I say it should be illegal.  You're setting up a straw man here.  I made a judgement about her behaviour, which you can do without suggesting rights enshrined in law!  There's plenty of behaviour which I would consider morally/ethically wrong but which I would not wish to make illegal.  Of course it's morally wrong to use certain language and talk about certain things in front of other people's children.  You also used the word ""should"" about the behaviour of all the other people in the shop, but I wasn't so disingenuous to retort with the non-argument that they had a ""right"" to respond as they did and she had no right not to be offended!  Is all this contradictory stuff really your idea of logic?

- Anyway, a shop is private property.  They have the legal right to refuse anyone's custom or ask them to leave (so long as it doesn't contravene discrimination law).  People don't have a legal right to behave any way they want on private property.

&gt;She was pushed, clearly. Did you watch the video? She is called more names than anyone else. 

Demonstrably false.  I did watch the video.  I think the person who took the video was perfectly polite and reasonable, and she responded with swearing.  Yes she's called a few names once she has already gone to the dark side, but she clearly does far more name calling and is far more offensive than anyone else.

You can't really criticise an episode for not treading the same ground as previous episodes. The concept of 'wanting to be selfish by changing the past' with fixed points has been covered thorougly by previous episdoes. I think it's refreshing to explore the whole 'fixed-point' thing from a different angle.

In regards to the Doctor's death being a fixed point, the Doctor's death wasn't the fixed point in time, never was. Everyone just thought that's what it was, even the Doctor himself, and that was the whole point. 
The whole second half of the season is the Doctor coming to terms with his own fallibility. He's spent all this time with people who put all their faith in him and believe he will always win out in the end. It's gone to his head. Learning about his death as a fixed point in time causes him to first run away, but ultimately confront himself and realise how reckless he's become.

She was asked (politely, in the circumstances) to stop swearing, and instead of taking a breath, and thinking about how she was acting she escalated her behaviour.  That is not a mark of someone who needs a little kindness, its mark of a bully. Of someone who's used to getting her own way if she stomps her feet and screams loudly enough.  In other words the kind of person I am least likely to feel any kind of sympathy for.  

On the other hand, the employe(es) appear to keep their temper, and explain the situation to her, whilst taking what in any polite society would be considered enormous amounts of abuse.  Those are the sort of people who I feel sympathy for and would defend.

That's another false argument.  A child was not used to 'make things worse' it was used to try to defuse the situation or at least temper it.

Stand out by standing up for an abusive bully? No I really don't think so.  I would have asked her politely to either shut up or get out.

&gt;Now calm down, and think about the situation logically.

Name calling?!? I'm not sure that phrase means what you think it means!  I think we're going down the road of patronising cod psychology here, which you're frankly not very good at.  It's never easy to infer people's emotions from text, and you've missed the mark here.  Stick to the arguments.

&gt;It is not immature to expect that after taking your money, a counterparty will provide you with the product you purchased. If they refuse, they have created a situation.

As I said, we don't know exactly what transpired.  You're making illogical inferences and speculating again.  This is not a particularly sensible, fair or logical way of finding out truth.  Without knowing the back story or the policies of the store, there may be any number of reasons why she couldn't get butter.  

&gt;Irrelevant. They don't even have to do their job well. They just need to provide their customers with the product.

Maybe the product doesn't come with butter, or maybe there's not butter available.  It's all speculation.  But in general, if something's not available at a store, it's not the server's fault; they are frequently bound by events, policies and conditions outside of their control, but they get the blame anyway thanks to immaturity and ignorance in customers.  That's one of the reasons why it's a hard job.  Customers can become aggressive and rude, even racist and abusive.  Of course this is relevant!

&gt;Yes they should. They are in public. You have no right to not be offended, at any age.

- I never said anyone had a right to not be (sic) offended.  Nor did I say it should be illegal.  You're setting up a straw man here.  I made a judgement about her behaviour, which you can do without suggesting rights enshrined in law!  There's plenty of behaviour which I would consider morally/ethically wrong but which I would not wish to make illegal.  Of course it's morally wrong to use certain language and talk about certain things in front of other people's children.  You also used the word ""should"" about the behaviour of all the other people in the shop, but I wasn't so disingenuous to retort with the non-argument that they had a ""right"" to respond as they did and she had no right not to be offended!  Is all this contradictory stuff really your idea of logic?

- Anyway, a shop is private property.  They have the legal right to refuse anyone's custom or ask them to leave (so long as it doesn't contravene discrimination law).  People don't have a legal right to behave any way they want on private property.

true,Sam-I-Am-Not,null,null,"Fine, I'll take out the time to address all of these insipid questions.  I'm only going to be addressing his claims that the plot is illogical.  Whether or not Doctor Who creates an emotional connection is beyond the scope of this comment.  

1) The Silence put River in a space suit for three reasons that I can see.  First, it was important to hide who was killing the Doctor. This is obviously true for us, the audience, but you could argue that it's true within the narrative, as Amy as much as said she'd kill anyone to stop the Doctor's death.  Secondly, the spacesuit was some weird device from her childhood that they used so they didn't have to feed her or take care of her.  I know that that isn't vital to the plot, but it's a cool little insight into the minds of the Silence (race) and not at all a random ""clunky"" device.  Finally, and most importantly, River said that the spacesuit was automated to kill the Doctor.  Having failed to successfully brainwash her, they programmed the suit to force her to do it.

2) The next question is, ""why does River have to kill the Doctor?"" The author adds some insipid idea about 90 Silence attacking the Tardis.  Obviously, the Silence know that the Doctor is a slippery little devil who has evaded death in the WORST situations for hundreds of years.  They choose, instead, to cleverly set up a fixed point where he MUST die.  It's the equivalent of Ripley's, ""I say we nuke it from orbit. It's the only way to be sure."" As to the more intelligent and unasked question of why Kovarian couldn't have just put an empty robot space suit down there, one can only assume as to how fixed points are made.  We know they require ""still points in time,"" and maybe it needs actual people doing actions.  If that doesn't satisfy you, Kovarian is a bitch about River and the Doctor, as you've seen at the end of Closing Time, and doing it for shits is not above her.

3) They make a comment in Let's Kill Hitler about how River Song's trying to kill him even though they're not at Lake Silencio. Watch the fucking episode please.

4) In Father's Day, the world crumbled after someone's time stream was crossed. Fixed points were not involved. The author is an idiot.  In Waters of Mars whatshername died at the end, so a fixed point wasn't altered.

5) 
&gt;The best thing about this episode was the way in which the Doctor avoided his death.

That's right, his absolute favorite part was the shitty deus ex machina at the end.

6) I agree with the last idea, that the Doctor wanting to hide that he escaped from River, Amy, and Rory is weak.  It's not illogical or a plot hole, but it is out of character.

I said I wouldn't discuss his argument that Moffat's Who isn't emotional enough because of self-fulfilling prophecies.  But the only two shows he mentions as being more emotionally charged were ""Father's Day"" and ""Waters of Mars."" As for Waters of Mars, everyone hates the over-the-top blubbering whining Time Lord Victorious crap.  Father's Day was emotional, but the emotion relied on evil gargoyles will tear apart the world unless Rose's dad dies.  So... the exact same illogical, self-fulfilling stuff the author is complaining about.  The only time I have ever teared up in Doctor Who is when 11 was sacrificing himself in the Big Bang.

true,FreddyDeus,yorkshire,Ayup,"This is a by-product of big government. The 'we'll tax the crap out of you but do everything for you' (cradle to the grave) style of government.

For example, once in Britain, every property owner was responsible for the maintenance of the road directly outside their property. The property owners would come to an agreement (usually) about how they would maintain the road and share the cost.

Then parish councils started to adopt the roads and duly took over their maintenance. Of course, local taxes were levied to cover these costs. Now this in principle isn't necessarily such a bad idea. The parish council could maintain consistency in the materials used for the roads, they could better coordinate where work needed to be done, and the costs could, in theory at least, be kept down due to bulk purchasing of materials and of course, having workmen on the books to do this sort of thing.

But then, politics happens.

In a democracy of course, politicians like to do things like buy votes (as well as indulge their pet projects or make their own neighbourhoods cleaner, safer and more enjoyable at the expense of others).

So the local councillors look at the roads, and they generally seem to be in a reasonable state of repair, so rather than spend the money they levy for road maintenance on road maintenance, they reallocate the funds to some other worthy and hopefully popular project.

And the roads get forgotten about.

Then one day, people start to notice that the roads are now in a terrible state. So they complain to the council. The council of course, can no longer afford to maintain the roads because the 'road tax' is now funding a beautiful fountain in the town square.

And the citizens shout. And the citizens get angry. And the citizens complain. But the citizens do not pick up a spade or shovel and repair the roads themselves. And why should they. They were told that they were paying someone else to take on that responsibility.

I don't think the point of the cracks closing was to say that it entirely re-wrote history; as I pointed out before, causation and the cracks interact in some pretty strange ways. For a start, some people still retain a memory of what occurred (e.g. Amy, the Doctor, etc.). But secondly, and more importantly, because time doesn't actively re-adjust itself to compensate for the individual people never existing. River's diary is a bit curious; the words themselves disappear, implying that The Doctor never existed, but evidently River lives in a world where The Doctor did exist at some point (see: that episode where they showed what would have happened had he never existed).

The point of the Pandorica restarting the Universe was to take an exact copy of the universe prior to it exploding and to 'restore' it onto the current one. This means that it is the ENTIRE universe at the *exact* moment before the TARDIS explodes. Amy's involvement is just that she gets to modify the universe ever so slightly before it gets restored to exactly the same state it was in before (minus the TARDIS exploding). That's why Rory is alive and not plastic.

Her memory is, however, a bit strange in the way it works; she obviously has no direct memory of her parents, but is able to bring them into reality nonetheless. This is the same for The Doctor; she doesn't know all about The Doctor's various adventures over his 900 (ish) year old life, but she can, effectively, 'open the door' for him to re-enter reality.",0,1318080847,null,0,false,0,c2pu5ph,t3_l476b,t1_c2pu5ph,t1_c2pmigw,1427703212,1,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,1

As far as I can see, when the Pandorica restored reality, it did so on the basis that it was restoring *exactly* what had occurred the instant before the TARDIS closed.

Now, obviously this new reality is different in some ways (for instance, Amy's parents, Rory, etc.), hence the use of the term ""this version of reality"".

Please folks if you don't want to get winter tyres at least get something like tyre socks! I had them before winter tyres and there was a traffic jam on a dual carriageway that left the outside lane free but with unpacked snow – I just drove out on to it and went on my merry way with all those in the jam blowing their horns at me.

&gt;Using your code of values, we'd all be living in prison and the murders and rapists would be walking the streets.

Using my code of values there would be significantly less murderers and rapists. Most criminals are slowly and incrementally made worse and worse by people's harmful reactions to them. This woman at the beginning of the video was just loud, by the end she was significantly more hateful. That hate builds up.

Instead of bossing her around, intimidating her with large numbers, and calling her names, the group could have been nice and the woman would have calmed down. It's not that difficult. Just don't make antagonistic situations worse.

She was being aggressive with 15 seconds of the start of the video, assuming that the cameraman didn't have his phone ready as soon as the argument started it can be inferred that she'd already been loud and aggressive enough to cause notice before the filming started.

Without much in the way of qualifications, you probably won't get anyone who will sponsor you for a work visa (oh, unless you have family in England who would sponsor you?).  I have two degrees (a bachelor's degree and a master's degree, the latter from Cambridge) and it was still quite a struggle getting a job after studying here.  I had to wow my employers enough to adequately demonstrate that there was no one in the UK or EU who had applied for the job (within a certain time frame) who was even close to being as well-qualified as me in order for them to offer me the job.  It cost them a lot of money in work visa fees to choose me over a local.  

I don't want to discourage you, but that Cracked article wasn't really a joke.  Sure, it had jokes in it and made me laugh when I read it, but the meat of it is accurate, and kind of made me feel like Wonder Woman for moving to another country successfully.  It's pretty fucking hard to get permission to live and work here (legally).  Besides the obvious, there are lots of things that cost money that you would never think of (like the fees it costs sending my money from England to my US bank account every month because my American student loans need to be paid from an American bank) that add up to make this an expensive, time consuming and stressful thing to put yourself through.  And it really does take a hell of a long time to complete each step, and each form usually has a hefty fee that has to accompany it, and then there's the months and months of waiting to get approval to move on to the next step...and they keep making it more difficult and more expensive!

But, it's also really cool to live in a country that isn't your own; I think it's one of the best educations a person can have.

true,satisfiedsardine,null,null,"I have lived through a few economic  downturns / recessions and this one to me seemed not as bad as the mid to late eighties; we had higher unemployment at 12% compared to the present 8% and we were often genuinely concerned that there could be a nuclear war any day. People really thought it was the end of the good times and all going get worse from there.

I seem to recall people were on the whole poorer then now or rather the poor of now are richer in what they have. Electronics were out of reach for most (nowadays even the poorest have a large  flat screen TV and a  smartphone and fairly ok clothes ) where as I remember quite clearly we had to rent a TV from Rumbelow’s and- it was actually a coin operated TV which you would feed 50p's to pay for it. Our clothes as kids were not replaced they were patched, same with socks – these would not get thrown out, they would get yarned over. It’s very different now, clothes are so cheap; I went into a shop today with my wife (H&amp;M) and bought a toddlers woolly hat and gloves for five pounds, we never had clothes anywhere near that cheap unless you went into a charity shop.

However we did seem a lot happier, but some of that could perhaps be my own nostalgia that's seducing my perspective on what it was really like.  It was a lot more simple from what I recall. We only had two to three channels on TV and everyone across the country would watch the same program (normally something like 'it's a knockout' or a gameshow).  We also were not relentlessly presented with the huge amount of information that surrounds us now, you really did have much of a clue what was going on in the rest of the world apart from the big wars or an African famine.  Very different to how it is now where I have a constant feed of injustices happening around the world which I can’t do much about.

I think we spent more time out and about then as well. Kids would be out all day with no need to be carrying a mobile phone, you would go out from 8am until 8pm and your parents were not worried about paedophiles or child killers. If you wanted to find out information you had to go to the libray and find a book and often it would already be loaned out so you would have to wait a few days, that’s very different to now where you can be served a Wikipedia entry and get yourself to a semi-expert level on any obscure subject in an instant.

We also had closer communities, everyone would go to the pub for every event and local shops had a bigger presence in everyday life so you often got to know what was happening from picking up on gossip from the butcher or the fruit and veg shop.

I have to admit, at risk of sounding like an old cunt; I miss it and it seemed better back then, even though I have much more now materially.

It's the similar to the way you could argue why he ""fell in love"" with Rose. She was, as far as we know, his first companion after the Time War. The 9th Doctor was a cold and distant man, often keep Rose away from him emotionally because of the scars he had from the Time War. When he regenerated he was able to leave SOME of those burdens behind and become closer to Rose, basically using her as a emotional crutch.

true,j4w,null,null,"In my opinion definitely consider Cheltenham, it has more 1 bed flats available and for 1-beds the non-uber swanky areas of Cheltenham can be reasonable price-wise (and still be pretty damn nice)

I moved to Cheltenham in September for my new job (Detica at Gloucester Business Park). When I was looking I asked someone at the company pretty much the exact same question. 

I got this response:

&gt;It's difficult to say a particular area to avoid in Gloucester because I think even within an area it can vary a lot from one end to the other. The city centre does have a few other areas that are perhaps not so nice to live. I would avoid the area around Barton Street and anywhere very close to Gloucester park. (Saying that though, I have a friend that lives right next to Gloucester park around where Fred West used to live and I've never had any issues when visiting her but I've always felt a little uncomfortable). If you want to live in the centre, probably the best place to start looking is beside the rugby ground. A few people from work live round there. I think the houses there are quite decent considering it's the city centre. The further you go from the city centre and towards Longlevens, the nicer the houses get. Also around Linden Road is central and quite nice. 

&gt;If you were looking for somewhere outside of the city centre, Brockworth would be a good place to look. The Detica offices are in Brockworth so you could walk to work. It's also along the number 10 bus route, which goes both to Gloucester and to Cheltenham, which means if you went drinking in Cheltenham you could stay out quite late (around 11:00 for the last bus) and not have to pay for a taxi home. There's also Hucclecote right next to Brockworth.

&gt;There's a lot of other areas outside of the centre which are really nice. I live in Abbeymead which is quite close to work. I could cycle easily if I had a bike. It would also be easy walking distance if I could cut across a field but it's a building site at the moment (so I drive instead). There's also Abbeydale, Longlevens, Churchdown and Barnwood. It's probably best to avoid Matson, Podsmead, Coney Hill and Hempsted if you can help it.

&gt;You can also live in Cheltenham. Cheltenham is much prettier than Gloucester, but normally quite a bit more expensive. I don't know Cheltenham so well, but a lot of people from work live there (who turn their nose down at Gloucester). Whenever there's a work social event it's always in Cheltenham. 

&gt;That was a bit of an essay about the areas in Gloucester, sorry about that! Gloucester isn't really as bad as this email may sound. Even in the roughest areas it will not be anywhere near as bad as somewhere like Birmingham, and on the whole it's actually okay.

I spent a day and a half looking for flats around Gloucester but in the end I went with Cheltenham instead, £495/month for a sub-basement flat not far from the high street. ",0,1318103170,null,0,false,0,c2pwa0q,t3_l54ed,t1_c2pwa0q,t1_c2pw42e,1427704277,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

true,brigantus,eng-yorkshire,London via Leeds,"Well, number one, no you don't. Nobody speaks *exactly* like formal written English, it would sound utterly bizarre. If you're from the south your grammar will probably be closely aligned to written English (although not if you speak Cockney, for example) but you're certainly not going to employ the same sentence structures or choice of words.

Number two, written English is a different [register](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Register_(sociolinguistics)) to the spoken language, not the ""correct"" form enshrined in black and white. It has evolved parallel to the spoken varieties of English and for historical reasons happens to most closely resemble the accents of the Home Counties (London being the centre of British literary culture when writing became a widespread practice). In the last two centuries because of population movements and mass media there has been a homogenisation of the way we speak and those same set of accents have been disproportionally influential.

But don't make the mistake of thinking that makes either standard written English or Received Pronunciation the ""correct"" dialect/accent. Both grammars and dictionaries are *descriptive* works, they are supposed to capture how a language used at a given time and place, not tell you how to speak it. Therefore any good grammar of English would take into account the many regional variations, though obviously there are practical limitations to this given how many there are. It would say that written English employs one register (or a couple, formal and informal, etc.) which is standardised across the country while spoken English employs another, equally rule-bound and internally consistent, set of registers that vary geographically.

Oh, and I hope it goes without saying, but: northerners can write standard English just as well as southerners. They can even speak it!

Nostalgia for the past is the fodder of right wing apologists who would love to believe that things were always better in the past...

When I bought my current house all you had to do was wait a couple of months and the market would almost completely refresh. That's not happening at the moment. 

Not to fall into stereotypes, but for the money you've got your best bet is North England, Scotland (but bear in mind the odd rules they have up there) or Wales. But generally, if you're only paying £50k you're either in an area that's highly undesirable or where unemployment is high, reducing your chance of getting employment. You also need to consider transport. If you've not got a car, some of the public transport in GB is woeful. 

I'd suggest looking for a down area that's planning on a rejuvenation program in the hope you can buy property now and the area will improve around you over time. Obviously this is a risk, because the area may not improve. Also, lots of other people are looking for this, especially developers. 

If it's crime you're really worried about, go to http://www.police.uk/ to see detailed, street level crime statistics for an area, broken down by crime type.

There's quite a few of those properties (some new builds) in the town center too, a town center which has just received a fuck-tonne  of investment, is a gorgeous small city and easily in commuting distance with Liverpool, even Manchester at a push.  [It's also got history coming out of its pores.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chester)

[This one below £50k](http://www.expertagent.co.uk/in4glestates/{352a42d4-97ed-43c1-b08e-0ac72e0b5dee}/{61c01542-46a7-44ac-92ca-8ae0af7a9a89}/external.pdf) is about a 3 minute walk from [Frodsham St](http://www.fotolibra.com/gallery/852937/rbs-building-frodsham-street-chester/) (you can judge for yourself on the neighbourhood), is a gated community, and about a 4 minute walk to the train station.  It's new build too so at least you won't have to do any repairs.  There's quite a few like it too.  You only actually buy 50% of this particular property, it's set up to allow people to get on the property ladder, so if the property becomes worth £150k remember you're only getting £75k if you sell.

true,LokianEule,mccoy,Time's Champion,"Doctor Who ran from 1963-1989 then rebooted in 2005. By no means do I suggest you start at 1963. You should choose between 2005 reluanch and 2010 when the new writer, Doctor, and companions took over. It felt very much like a re-relaunch.

Pros of 2005: you get to see more Doctors, more adventures, companions, etc. You won't miss out on it by skipping it. No prior info needed to watch here

Cons: It's a bit cheesy and the writing needs a lot of forgiveness the first two series. The show still shines though.

For 2010 Pros: Great writing, shiny new everything, same awesomeness that DW always has, fresh start, no prior info needed

Cons: You miss out on 2005-2009. You won't get to experience the show chronologically and see how things change and develop. You'll get spoiled by the special effects.

Even with these pros and cons, if you choose 2010 you should go back afterwards to 2005 and up. While the writing and effects may not be as shiny, there are still wonderful heartbreaking stories here, and both Doctors absolutely shine. Many people went on Who-hiatus because they thought the new guy wouldn't live up to the 10th Doctor. The ninth only has one series with some questionable writing, but he's a fantastic Doctor as well, and shines when given the chance. No matter what you do, watch all six series.

That's the genius of it.  It FLOATS!!!

Well you could always extend the mooring rope I suppose but why would you bother when lord and master of 1.8 liters of throbbing engine?  Run those rapids.  Save pensioners and milfs and dogs from the rooftops of their flooded homes.  Become a hero and a local celebrity.  Win the hearts of the people.  Achieve your full potential. 

Of course I suppose if that's not your cup of tea you could always go up through a series of locks so you're on a hill.  Hills tend not to flood.  They're very strict on it in the UK.  All water must go downhill.  There are standards to be maintained.  

&gt;Can you back up the claim that 'chicks will love it'?

What's not to love?  Also 12.3 million hits for 'Girls Love Canal Boats' speaks volumes for itself, and Google was only looking for 0.15 seconds.  I dare say if he put a little more time into it he could find billions!

Tom Baker (Fourth Doctor) was the longest. He was the doctor for 7 years, 1974 – 1981

Peter Davison (Fifth Doctor) did 3 years 1981 – 1984

Colin Baker (Sixth Doctor) only did 2, 1984 – 1986

Sylvester McCoy (Seventh Doctor) also did 2 years, 1987 – 1989. Though he did come back for the 1996 movie.

true,abw,cnty-uk,Surrey,"If you buy your house outright, then yes.  The problem is that many people are taking out huge mortgages to buy property that they can't really afford.

Right now the interest rates are being kept artificially low by the Bank of England in a desperate attempt to stabilise the ~~casino~~ economy.  So a £300k mortgage might be costing £9k a year in interest payments,  or £750 per month.  If you're paying off the capital so that you actually own the home at the end of it then you'll need to find another £10k a year (assuming a 30 year mortgage).

If (or should I say ""when"") the interest rate hits 15% like it did at the end of the 80's then that same mortgage will be costing £45k each year, or £3750 per month in interest payments alone. More like £4500pm if you're also paying off the capital.

Assuming you haven't got that kind of money, you have no choice but to sell your house or have it repossessed by the bank.  Unfortunately, you discover that everyone else is trying to sell their overpriced houses and no-one is buying.  The housing bubble bursts, prices come crashing down and you're in a negative equity position.  People end up losing their homes and still owing the bank money. 

So I agree with InfernoZeus, that is it not a good time to be *investing* in the UK housing market.  However, people need somewhere to live.  They're less interested in the *investment* and more concerned about having a roof over their heads.  So in many cases they don't have much choice but to play the property game, even if they know the casino has the odds stacked heavily against them.

The vendor pays the Estate Agent fees.  There's no stamp duty to pay on a £50k house.  The survey (if you have one) and legal costs might amount to a few hundred pounds.  All in all, it's probably going to be less than a month or two's rent.  And don't forget that there are startup costs associated with renting, too (e.g. deposit).

&gt; Renting isn't living in your bank account.

Renting is paying off someone else's mortgage for them.  It's good in the short term or if you can't afford a mortgage of your own.  But that isn't the case here.

true,SirMuttley,cnty-uk,British in Bangkok,"Fucking guardian.

Even the sub headline says:

&gt; Upmarket party organisers want to host banquets with live music among memorials to merchant seamen

Then further in the article

&gt; Moving Venue, a firm that specialises in arranging banquets in ""unique and prestigious"" locations around the capital, says that it wants to hold parties from 22 November to 17 December.

In fact no other company or bank is mentioned in the entire article. Now I'm sure banks are among the clients of Moving Venue, but so will be plenty of other firms in the city. These firms use companies like Moving Venue to do all the work of arranging parties so they don't have to. The title is misleading to pander to guardian readers and their hatred for bankers.


**edit:** and the comments don't disappoint:

&gt; Jaw-droppingly inappropriate. But what to the Tories care? It's only a memorial to a lot of dead oiks who were stupid enough to die for their country, isn't it? 

Yet Tower Hamlets council is Labour controlled, 41 seats to the 8 Tories. But let's not let facts get in the way of a good bashing.

The end result is a smaller and more stagnant gene pool from which to breed.  The same thing could also be said of the upper classes in years gone by.  Not wanting to marry ""below your class"" resulted in a similarly limited gene pool, leading to common traits in many of the upper classes (e.g. recessed chins).

I've been up for the past 12 hours. I'm fucking exhausted. I'm walking around in a large leather jacket and carrying two bags, one with an Umbrella Corp logo on it, and a laptop with the Reddit Sticker on the front. I'm clearly not a threat. 

I walk into the Security checkpoint and I shit you not, there are about 15 guys just standing there doing not a damn thing. One of them is surprised to see me but does the basic ""Gels, liquids, Etc"" bit and asks me to put my laptop in one bin, my coat and pocket stuffs in another. I forget to take my sonic screwdriver, 10s edition, out of my inside pocket.

It goes through and the guy takes this thing out of my pocket and looks at me and gives me a very quizzical look.

It should be known that I'm in Canada, but I've got a very distinct English accent so I tried to explain Doctor Who. He just keeps looking at it like it's a goddamn remote trigger for a bomb. 

I'm trying to talk him down, meanwhile two guys just down from me are laughing. They clearly recognize what it is, and my face turning blood red isn't helping matters. 

So it ends with me asking if I can see it for a second. He grudgingly hands it over and I demonstrate. I pop the top, and hit the button for the light/buzzer. The sound scares the fuck out of him and he jumps at least a foot in the air. By now the two guys who know what it is are in hysterics and are trying not to laugh outloud. 

He says that ""You're better off just saying it's a toy next time"" and I got all defensive and said ""It's a replica. Not my fault you're uncultured."" 

Here's a note for you. Don't piss off security guys.

That dude probably would have taken me off to some interrogation room if it weren't for the two guys off to the side who came over and told him it's okay. One of them looks at me and goes ""I'm sorry, I'm so so sorry"" in his best Tennant impersonation, and the other looks at me, cocks his head towards the door and says """"Allons-y!""

true,Red_player,null,null,"&gt;If you really want to understand what a god/God is, you have to ask people, and I've asked people, and the kinds of things they have said are the same sorts of things that the Doctor does. 

Eh... I'm not sure what you're trying to say. Other people can be wrong/have poorly thought out arguments, just like you or me. Asking someone else doesn't give your argument authority, and authority doesn't make your argument valid.
In any case, the way I would define god is; *A being or object with supernatural attributes and/or power to interact with the universe in ways that would otherwise break the laws of physics.*

&gt;Thus, in general, it is safe to say that the Doctor could easily be called a god.

Again, I disagree on 2 points. 1: The doctor never does anything I would define as supernatural or breaking the laws of the universe.
2: The doctor doesn't have any inherent powers. He uses the tardis to do whatever it is you consider godly. If anything, the tardis could be seen as a god, if not for point 1.

&gt;And yes, as I said, the term ""supernatural"" is really meaningless when applied to reality, since everything in reality is technically natural. 

Yeah. Funny how that works out. We've managed to define gods out of existence already. Still, lets look up the word to see what it actually means.
 
***adjective:*** of, pertaining to, or being above or beyond what is natural; unexplainable by natural law or phenomena; abnormal. 

***noun:*** a being, place, object, occurrence, etc., considered as supernatural or of supernatural origin; that which is supernatural, or outside the natural order. 

[source](http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/supernatural)

So in conclusion, a god would be a being that can do supernatural things. The doctor doesn't do that. His tardis doesn't do that. Neither of them are gods.

I'm still curious how you define god tho, if you're willing to accept something perfectly natural as a god.",0,1318174903,null,0,false,0,c2q2cwz,t3_l4rva,t1_c2q2cwz,t1_c2q229u,1427707211,1,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,1

Sounds like AN Wilson knows absolutely fuck all about Steve Jobs. He didn't actually design the products, nor did he have the technical expertise to execute them. And I'm not really sure what 'backroom boy' means but given that Steve Jobs was renowned for introducing Apple's products with great showmanship the word 'backroom' seems utterly wrong. His talent was for choosing the right people, pushing them to do their best work and for not being afraid to make difficult decisions like scrapping projects that weren't following his vision.

Seriously, has AN Wilson got Jobs confused with someone else? Whether or not you agree with placing of Jobs at the same level as Edison or Ford, those three quotes are factually inaccurate.

Firstly if you're on private property the owners or their representatives can eject you from the premises whenever you like, and prevent you from doing various things like taking photos or protesting. If this was a public street, in theory and traditionally no such rules apply. That's why the trend towards privately owned public spaces is so insidious- where once all shopping was done on publicly owned streets with private shops, now we have supermarkets and shopping malls, and sometimes even public streets which have been sold to private companies, like the [bullring in Birmingham](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dexR21idVho). 

Secondly we now have [terrorism legislation](http://photographernotaterrorist.org/map/) which makes the following illegal, with a maximum sentence of 10 years:

* a) To collect or possesses information of a kind likely to be useful to a person committing or preparing an act of terrorism.

* b) Possess a document or record containing information of that kind.

That is incredibly broad-brush- could this photo be information gathered for the purposes of planting a bomb?

It's not the textbook definition of passive aggressive, It's called Not being an asshole and letting a more rational course of action prevail. 

But hey, fuck that right? It's not like you didn't already come here on the defensive, and when I made a joke about you undercutting me - that was very clearly a joke - you responded very seriously like I'd accused you of stealing my idea(which is ludicrous), and started throwing out accusations of being passive-aggressive when I'm just trying to be fucking polite. Now I think you're just taking the piss.

So, Let's quit being polite, Let's have it out in public then. You want to give me shit because you're paranoid about some passive aggressive bollocks you're inventing completely in your own head, then okay, no more ""Passive aggressive"", I'll just be straight and blunt with you.

I'm sure the next accusation will be that I'm now angrily screaming and ranting - some people can just never be pleased, I guess. Suffice it to say, if you have such illusions, they are entirely your own. You're not worth getting angry about.

Mine are objectively better - Imagine it this way, if you will. I decided to start screen-printing, and I've got experience in something else that gives me moderate skill. I get good enough results, but do you think that I'll be doing it better that you could, with two decades of experience and good equipment? 

If you do, thanks for the compliment, but I think you're a little out of touch with reality.

I have access to high-quality equipment, I have the experience with and knowledge of the product, and I've got access to the suppliers to put it on whatever substrate I please - Three options? who in the hell are you buying from, man? They HAVE to be messing with you. I honestly should hook you up with someone that won't jerk your chain like that. But anyway, What are you doing, I'm guessing printing on the badge surface and then putting it in a heat press? Of course I'm going to have a higher quality product.

Yeah, I am the underdog here. I don't own the equipment, I just have access to it in my free time, when I'm not at my real job, and it costs me money to do so, and naturally, I'm buying my own substrates - I've got experience with the product, but all I have otherwise is an etsy store I set up in a rush because a bunch of people here wanted to buy one.

And if you want to try slinging insults about how together my business is, I've been in business a week and a half, You've been in business for 20 years - My question is, why are you only managing to set up and go to a convention now? You're a decade behind my expectations. I have also been approached for custom jobs, and in a completely separate(and surprising to me) turn, I have a local business who has taken an interest, and wants me to supply these, along with doing their company IDs and Name-bars. I haven't even advertised anywhere outside of r/DoctorWho yet, though, so I'll give you some credit - With a little hard work on my part, I'd say before too long, you might be right, and you'll be the underdog instead. Not that we're really in direct competition - Sure, screen-printing and embroidery is the family business, but It's not my personal business, and you are not even selling product yet. Get some out the door, then try to act like you're a threat - Because right now, just because you're bigger than me, doesn't make you impressive. Yeah, you're vending at a convention after twenty years, good on you. You'd get more congratulations if I hadn't seen rank amateurs do the same at more expensive professional conventions in five.

Don't try to tell me exactly what I've been writing. Aside from the fact I can see it right there, literally inches away, I'm the bastard that wrote it. I know exactly what I said, and what I intended to say, I don't need you to tell me, but thank you so much for the help there.

Violent crime is on a downward trend. That's not me  pointing to a newspaper or an incident in my own life.

To give you an idea: I live in rural Wales - there aren't many jobs around here, but it suits what I do &amp; I love it. It's one of the poorest areas in the UK, but it's beautiful, people are great, no crime, a lot going for it IMO...

This year I bought a one bedroom cottage in the middle of nowhere with a couple of acres of grazing land. Not a great deal of change out of £200k (which in my case means mortgage for 30 years).

Around here £50k will get you either an empty plot with planning permission some distance from a town (and no house), or an extremely small mid-terraced place in a grotty location you won't want to live in. If you got very, very lucky you might find a run-down place in a nice location that you could do up. Auctions are best for this, but even so, it would be a right wreck for that money or the local builders would snap it up.

I've just spotted another comment in which you're considering the Valleys area - it is indeed cheaper! There is also a reason! Basically this was a fairly populous area where most people had jobs until Thatcher closed the mines (and the rest of industry followed) in the 80's. Since then it's become a bit run-down to say the least. Don't get me wrong, there are some fine people around down there, but it's a bit on the dilapidated side and has its share of troubles. At least go and have a good look round first!

Believe it or not I'm not trying to put you off - I sincerely wish you luck - but you might want to recalibrate your expectations a bit!

Edit - oh, if you're seriously thinking about rural Wales, you want low crime, nice scenery etc. but proximity to job market / general trappings of civilisation is not an issue, I'd suggest looking north of the Dyfi estuary and around the Mawddach. Search on Tywyn, Fairbourne, Barmouth etc. Nice places (well, maybe not Fairbourne) but it takes *ages* to go anywhere.

Seriously, good for you for taking the initiative to do something cool, but you won't win people over by being a dick about it online. 

""I'm guessing printing on the badge surface and then putting it in a heat press?""

Nope. Printing on transfer paper and then sublimating it onto the badge on a heat press, just as the manufacturer of the product instructs to do. As I already explained, these were just a first attempt and I overcooked them a bit so the black isn't as solid as it should be. I wouldn't be selling these particular ones, because they look OK in a picture but in person they look like crap. I have the heat press and a bag of blanks that I've already paid for, so I'll get the pressure and exposure time right, and those will be the ones I put up for sale. Why is that hard to grasp? As for ""undercutting"" your price, let's be honest--the blanks cost 50 cents, the amount of ink and paper consumed is about 10 cents, and the pinback is about 10 cents. So it's 70 cents worth of materials, plus the time it takes to set up the art, do the sublimating and glue on the pins. If I was planning to make 1000 of these, I'd be selling them for $3/each due to the efficiencies inherent in mass-producing them. But since I'll only make a few dozen (at least for now), then the time invested in making them makes them worth about $5. So maybe the blanks cost you more, perhaps that is why you're charging more, that's fine. But I'm basing my price on my costs and the time/labor it takes to make them, not at all on someone else's price that I wasn't even aware of at the time I first made these.

As for my business vs. yours, I am not the one who set up that comparison, you are. Don't throw it in my face as if I brought it up first. I've been screenprinting for 20 years but for 18 of those years it was my weekend/extra money thing while I worked various 9-5 jobs in graphic design and IT, but my the company laid off everyone at the end of 2008. When I had a full time job, my shirt business was never at the volume to have enough inventory to do a show like NYCC (you need to do roughly $3000 to basically break even on the fees and time and other costs to be there, and to sell that much you need to take roughly $10-$20K in inventory with you). I've been doing smaller cons off and on the whole time but NYCC is a huge step up in risk I'm now taking because I have built up enough strong designs and had time to print up the inventory to (possibly) sell enough to make it worth it. Also keep in mind that while ""rank amateurs"" may show up with a booth at an event like NYCC, a lot of them go home broke. The key to judging is whether someone comes back the next year. So we'll see how i do on that.

That said, I never said anything that implied that me having a more developed business meant my name tags were better than yours--I simply pointed out your apparent tactic of simultaneously ""praising"" my business while at the same time implying that people should ""support"" you because you were ""the underdog"", and that it came off as just insincere to me. Making these name tags is not a huge part of my business, it's just something cool I thought I'd try since I have the equipment. My wildest expectations would be to sell maybe 50 of them, because they're just one more thing at my booth which currently has zero other Dr Who related merch. So if you can sell 100's of them because you know more people in the Who fanbase online, that's zero skin off my nose. I honestly don't care, I just don't get why you needed to start insulting my business in the first place.",0,1318185549,null,0,false,0,c2q3kf2,t3_l36j2,t1_c2q3kf2,t1_c2q3345,1427707780,1,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,1

If Doctor Who had been created in America I imagine it would be much more about using guns and weapons to defeat aliens than simple words or ""[a kettle and some string](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szuP0oBZX4g&amp;t=4m04s)"".

You see a lot of people claiming this sort of thing on the internet. But it seems wrong to me. Before the Mac, no one had tried to sell a mass-market computer with a GUI. They invented many of the UI concepts that we now take for granted. Before Pixar, no one had tried to make feature length films using computer animation.

Before the iPod, there were certainly other MP3 players. But no one had been successful in the mass-market because they were hobbled with terrible user interfaces. Before the iPhone few normal consumers considered smartphones, once again because of the poor user interfaces and clunky hardware. It was the first phone to use multi-touch, and had a quality of software that blew all competitors out of the water. The iPad was the first commercially successful tablet.

And even now, competitors are unable to match the MacBook air's quality of construction for the price. Brushing all this off as 'making it more fashionable' makes it sound easy.

The most important thing that they and they alone have brought to the World is software that Just Works[tm] (my terminology, not theirs).  

The best example I can give is to recount what what happened when I bought a digital camera about 10 years ago.  I opened the box to find a stark warning telling me that I MUST NOT CONNECT IT TO MY WINDOWS COMPUTER WITHOUT FIRST INSTALLING THE DRIVER SOFTWARE AND BLAH BLAH BLAH.  So I did all of that, rebooted the machine twice, connected the camera, ran the software, clicked half a dozen menu items, eventually managed to import a bunch of photos.  It took the best part of an hour in total.

Then I connected the camera to my iMac.  It launched iPhoto and displayed a popup window with a picture of the camera and a message saying ""You have just connected your Canon Digital IXUS 400.  Do you want to import the photos?"".  I clicked on ""Yes"" and a few seconds later the job was done.

As trivial as it sounds, this fundamental shift from functional user interfaces containing hierarchical menus of the various functions that the **hardware/software** can perform, to task-based user interface that more closely represent the operations that **users** want to do with the hardware/software, was ground breaking.

That was Jobs' vision.  It began with NeXT computers 20-odd years ago, was realised in a commercial OS with the release of Mac OSX, and became ubiquitous with the iPod, iPhone and iPad.  User interface technology is undergoing a revolution right now and we have Steve Jobs and Apple to thank for that.

Like it or not, they changed the world and we're never going back.  Even if you've never used an Apple product in your life, you are seeing the changes in every other modern computing platform: Windows, Linux, Android, other smart phones, web sites, kiosk software, and so on.

Social commentators like A.N.Wilson might have forgotten Steve Jobs by next week, but judging by his vacuous remarks and inaccurate observations, he didn't even know who he was in the first place.  Not to mention the fact that he clearly has no little to no experience of using and objectively evaluating computing platforms or user interfaces. 

The World might not remember the name of Steve Jobs in 100 years, but the contribution that Apple made under the leadership and vision of Steve Jobs will be with us for a long, long time.

For example: The Fourth falls, and instead of regenerating into The Fifth (A) he regenerates into The Fifth (B). Now The Fifth (B) has all of the original Eleventh's memories. He can now know not to do everything wrong he did from now until his Eleventh regeneration. And would effectively just collapse time and space all over again like River Song. Many of his original adventures became fixed points. He can't repeat them or else cause a collapse in time, i.e. The Ninth/Rose saving Rose's father.

And even if time/space didn't collapse. What the Hell would be the point of watching this new version of The Fifth go to the next event and this time know exactly what to do.

One cool idea? Not really. Everybody has cool ideas all the time. Fact of life - I simply moved on it. It's not my first cool idea, and it won't be the last, and I'm not hugely cut up about it - I went into it knowing other people would be trying it on too. Remember how I said that it would be ludicrous to think otherwise? And yeah, you don't win people over being a dick online, but when I tried to be polite, you think I'm being a dick anyway, so really, I might as well just be dead straight with you, and speak my mind, rather than wasting the effort on being nice, since you apparently read a personal attack in it anyway. I'm still being soft on you, really, I'd rather be entirely civil, but we tried that already and it didn't do a goddamn thing.

Let me be absolutely clear - I WAS 100% JOKING ABOUT UNDERCUTTING ME. For fuck's sake, I already knew what you would have done, it's the same thing I did - and since you've never heard of me before, and you'd be stupid gauging interest without a price already in mind. And if you've managed to keep your business going for 20 years, you're clearly not stupid. And it's not like I haven't told you I was joking three times already.

As for your process - I did think of that one, but weighed it up and figure on the other, oh well, I guessed slightly wrong. It's still not the best process for what you want to do, but it will do well enough, though it is far more time-and-labor intensive than it really should be - as somewhat of my clumsy way of extending an olive branch, so to speak, I advise you to look for alternatives. Even if that alternative isn't me, because frankly, while I'd still do business with you - Arguments online are one thing, but business is still business, and linking the two would be foolish - but I can't blame you if you wouldn't want to do business with someone like me, considering that no matter what I've done, you've interpreted it as an attack. Not that I'm not giving you stick now, but still, only this post and the post before so far, but I digress. Even if you end up paying more per unit, you'll still be making more in the long run, all things considered, and you'll be stocking a higher quality product than you can achieve with the method you're using - and I've no doubt you're like me in that regard, and you want to be selling the highest quality product possible.

IF YOU WANT, I will tell you in detail why this is the case, but it's an explanation that isn't necessary unless you want it, and I'm not going to throw the inner workings of my process out in public anyway. Call me paranoid if you must, but that just doesn't sit right with me, aside from the fact that I'm not the only one involved.

Good on you. I mean that sincerely, You worked hard, and while I take issue with you currently, I don't deny that I respect anyone who does as you did.
I don't need to be told how it goes with a booth at a show - this might be the first time I've bothered selling anything personally, but I've run a few business I don't own over time, and I've done more than a few conventions which are NYCC size and bigger. If someone is going home broke from a con like NYCC, then I think they should have considered more carefully before they went.

I do think you're not giving yourself enough credit - You have quite a few very strong designs. Your site is full of them. Hell, I'm still going to buy some off you, simply because I like them. The printing time and such, Well, that's all you saying that, I can't judge one way or the other. And don't fool yourself into thinking that I'm hoping you fail - I'm annoyed, not malicious. I really do hope you're at NYCC 2012, and no joke, I've been telling my friends who are going to drop by and check out your stuff. And I still will be, because you seem to make good products. Annoyance is all well and good, as long as you don't let it get in the way of things, after all.

Well, maybe that ""Tactic"" was apparent to you, but it frankly isn't the case. If I'm going to praise you, then I mean it - backhanded compliments are a cowardly and despicable way to conduct one's self, and not only that, it devalues any actual praise one may give. As for insulting your business, well, you insulted me and I replied. Or do you not recall what you said in your post previous to that one? I'm sorry if I mistook you, but it seems you were pretty clear, there. If people are going to buy from me, they're going to buy from me. Frankly, I'm disgusted at the idea of people supporting me just because I'm the ""Underdog"" - if someone is going to give me money, I'd rather it be because they want to buy my product because I make high quality product at a reasonable price, rather than some nebulous idea designed to tug on the heart strings with one hand and the purse-strings with the other. People who do that have no goddamned pride or confidence in their work, and I'm most certainly not one of those people - I pride myself on making the highest quality product possible, and if I was failing to do so, I wouldn't sell it.

I would say don't underestimate your sales numbers - After all, I only expected to sell a handful, and people went kinda wild for them. Not in the hundreds - or even a hundred - but I'm pretty sure that's simply because I only advertised them once, in one thread, here, and by sending a few private messages out to people who registered an interest. However, that aside, I'd wager at a big con like NYCC, there's going to be a TON of Dr Who fans, and that's not even including the fact that there will be Dr Who fans going because there's a Dr Who Booth and Ian McNeice is going to be there as a featured guest.

As for knowing people in the Doctor who Fanbase - You overestimate me, sir. I picked up the idea for this after seeing a picture here on /r/Doctorwho, so I pitched it to /r/Doctorwho, and that's about it. And I only know about this because I was looking at some DW stuff on reddit, and figured ""Hey, there is a subreddit for everything, so there is likely going to be one for DW.

Doctor Who ran from 1963-1989 then rebooted in 2005. By no means do I suggest you start at 1963. You should choose between 2005 reluanch and 2010 when the new writer, Doctor, and companions took over. It felt very much like a re-relaunch.

Pros of 2005: you get to see more Doctors, more adventures, companions, etc. You won't miss out on it by skipping it. No prior info needed to watch here

Cons: It's a bit cheesy and the writing needs a lot of forgiveness the first two series. The show still shines though.

For 2010 Pros: Great writing, shiny new everything, same awesomeness that DW always has, fresh start, no prior info needed

Cons: You miss out on 2005-2009. You won't get to experience the show chronologically and see how things change and develop. You'll get spoiled by the special effects.

Even with these pros and cons, if you choose 2010 you should go back afterwards to 2005 and up. While the writing and effects may not be as shiny, there are still wonderful heartbreaking stories here, and both Doctors absolutely shine. Many people went on Who-hiatus because they thought the new guy wouldn't live up to the 10th Doctor. The ninth only has one series with some questionable writing, but he's a fantastic Doctor as well, and shines when given the chance. No matter what you do, watch all six series.

If you choose to start at 2005, please watch Blink beforehand. 2005 is a little hard and Blink will reassure you that it's worth it.",0,1318196196,null,0,false,0,c2q4w1l,t3_l6cvr,t1_c2q4w1l,t3_l6cvr,1427708404,24,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,24

It began life as a script for the classic series itself (the Doctor would have been the Sylvester McCoy incarnation) but the producer decided this story would reveal too much.  Much of the plot was reworked into the story *Ghost Light* and the Doctor's exploration of his roots got turned into a story about his companion, Ace, coming to grips with her own troubled past.  

*Lungbarrow* was later turned into a book by the author of the original script, and in the process he added things that wouldn't have been done had it been a tv episode, like appearances by former companions and characters.  For instance, ""Omega"" is a founding Time Lord who previously appeared in a couple of stories.

Personally, I like some bits of *Lungbarrow* a lot and other bits not as much.  There is at least one regular here who makes a point whenever anyone mentions the name of telling everyone how vile and awful and worthless *Lungbarrow* is and how anyone with a kind word to say about it is utterly, utterly wrong, so I expect he'll be along at any moment.  :)

Doctor Who ran from 1963-1989 then rebooted in 2005. By no means do I suggest you start at 1963. You should choose between 2005 reluanch and 2010 when the new writer, Doctor, and companions took over. It felt very much like a re-relaunch.

Pros of 2005: you get to see more Doctors, more adventures, companions, etc. You won't miss out on it by skipping it. No prior info needed to watch here

Cons: It's a bit cheesy and the writing needs a lot of forgiveness the first two series. The show still shines though.

For 2010 Pros: Great writing, shiny new everything, same awesomeness that DW always has, fresh start, no prior info needed

Cons: You miss out on 2005-2009. You won't get to experience the show chronologically and see how things change and develop. You'll get spoiled by the special effects.

Even with these pros and cons, if you choose 2010 you should go back afterwards to 2005 and up. While the writing and effects may not be as shiny, there are still wonderful heartbreaking stories here, and both Doctors absolutely shine. Many people went on Who-hiatus because they thought the new guy wouldn't live up to the 10th Doctor. The ninth only has one series with some questionable writing, but he's a fantastic Doctor as well, and shines when given the chance. No matter what you do, watch all six series.

We have had Bad Wolf, the cracks, Torchwood etc the writers and show runners layer the show with these subtle cues on the understanding that the people watching it will be looking out for them. Sure the casual audience might not but you get as much as you are willing to put into it back out. 

Example: I noticed the Doctor's return w/ coat last season when talking to Amy in the Forest and went online and over-analysed about it with everyone else but it was there for you to notice. It is all a part of the extended experience the creators craft around the show.

On the rest of it...I do think we're building up to a big reveal...a big climax. And I'd not be at all surprised if it ended up involving Omega as the big baddie.  He seems a likely engineer for beings like the Silence, after all...if he's still in his pocket/antimatter universe then he could will such things into being and refine them into the deadly and yet...oddly *forgettable*...weapons they are. He sent envoys into the regular universe before in *The Three Doctors*.

Though I would doubt that we're going to have any of the major elements from Lungbarrow. (And thank heavens, in my opinion. The looms. The looms. How I despise that element...) It may be interesting to find that the Doctor does have something to do with the foundations of his society, perhaps, though.

**ONE LAST THING** upon which nobody seems to have made much comment: somebody (I don't quite remember who) in The Wedding of River Song, stated that the Silence have styled themselves as the ""guardians of history"" or somesuch...I have a feeling that that will be highly significant to their motivations for fighting the Doctor...but I'm still very curious what exactly they mean by this self-given title.",0,1318217942,null,0,true,0,c2q7p7j,t3_l6c1l,t1_c2q7p7j,t3_l6c1l,1427709781,1,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,1

However, two national newspapers (Observer and Independent) ran articles saying they would support Wales now; the independent described Wales as ""that much maligned member of the union"" before going on to list everything they deemed ""cool"" about Wales from any field: Kimberley Nixon,  Alex Jones, Marina and the Diamonds, and of course Tom Jones.

true,Philomathematics,hartnell,Hartnell,"I agree that seeing River as a companion would be a lot of fun. But it seems like the Doctor is trying to lay low for a bit, and I very much doubt that River is good at not attracting unwanted attention. Beyond that, I got the sense that the Doctor was stepping out of the Pond/Williams family's life for a bit; they'll show up at some point, of course, but he's not actively seeking any of them out right now. So I really do think it would make sense to move on to a new companion for a while.

Besides that, there's been a lot of talk about how the ending to series six essentially reset the tone of the show, scaling it back and bringing the Doctor back to his roots as a simple man with a box who's not out to make a name for himself. With that in mind, I think a new companion is again in order, someone who will help wipe the slate clean and to whom the Doctor can explain everything all over again (""Yes, I'm an alien; one of the good ones, don't worry."" ""Bigger on the inside, right."" ""It's a bowtie. Bowties are cool."" And so on).

So on the one hand, wish fulfillment. But on the other hand, the apparent narrative trajectory, leading towards something completely different.

I agree.  I don't own an iPad because a tablet on which I can't install my own software is 90% useless to me.  It's a damn shame.  On the other hand, I do own an iPhone because I'm happy to accept the limitation.  As long as it makes telephone calls, plays music and sends messages, then everything else is a bonus.

At the other end of the scale, I own a number of MacBooks, MacPros and other ""proper"" computers that allow me to do whatever I want, including installing my own software *and* hardware (including non-Apple disks, displays, keyboards, tablets, etc).

However, their walled garden approach to *some* of their computing devices is an entirely separate issue from the progress they have made in UI design.  It is also incorrect to say that they have a deep-rooted tendency against interoperability.  It's true to a certain extent on their mobile devices (iPod, iPhone, iPad), and in that regard I also hope that the tendency will be reversed.

[This article is a good overview of what actually happened](http://www.folklore.org/StoryView.py?project=Macintosh&amp;story=On_Xerox,_Apple_and_Progress.txt).

&gt; Smalltalk has no Finder, and no need for one, really. Drag-and- drop file manipulation came from the Mac group, along with many other unique concepts: resources and dual-fork files for storing layout and international information apart from code; definition procedures; drag-and-drop system extension and configuration; types and creators for files; direct manipulation editing of document, disk, and application names; redundant typed data for the clipboard; multiple views of the file system; desk accessories; and control panels, among others. The Lisa group invented some fundamental concepts as well: pull down menus, the imaging and windowing models based on QuickDraw, the clipboard, and cleanly internationalizable software. 

&gt;Smalltalk had a three-button mouse and pop-up menus, in contrast to the Mac's menu bar and one-button mouse. Smalltalk didn't even have self-repairing windows - you had to click in them to get them to repaint, and programs couldn't draw into partially obscured windows. Bill Atkinson did not know this, so he invented regions as the basis of QuickDraw and the Window Manager so that he could quickly draw in covered windows and repaint portions of windows brought to the front. One Macintosh feature identical to a Smalltalk feature is selection-based modeless text editing with cut and paste, which was created by Larry Tesler for his Gypsy editor at PARC. 

&gt;As you may be gathering, the difference between the Xerox system architectures and Macintosh architecture is huge; much bigger than the difference between the Mac and Windows. It's not surprising, since Microsoft saw quite a bit of the Macintosh design (API's,sample code, etc.) during the Mac's development from 1981 to 1984; the intention was to help them write applications for the Mac, and it also gave their system designers a template from which to design Windows. In contrast, the Mac and Lisa designers had to invent their own architectures. Of course, there were some ex- Xerox people in the Lisa and Mac groups, but the design point for these machines was so different that we didn't leverage our knowledge of the Xerox systems as much as some people think. 

&gt;The hardware itself was an amazing step forward as well. It offered an all-in-one design, four-voice sound, small footprint, clock, auto-eject floppies, serial ports, and so on. The small, portable, appealing case was a serious departure from the ugly- box-on-an-ugly-box PC world, thanks to Jerry Manock and his crew. Even the packaging showed amazing creativity and passion - do any of you remember unpacking an original 128K Mac? The Mac, the unpacking instructions, the profusely-illustrated and beautifully- written manuals, and the animated practice program with audio cassette were tastefully packaged in a cardboard box with Picasso- style graphics on the side. 

Of course Apple was influenced by the concepts that were developed at PARC, but taking concepts that have been developed in pure research and making them applicable to an actual shipping product is a huge amount of work. As far as Apple 'stealing' from PARC: Xerox were an investor in Apple.

true,[deleted],null,null,"I don't see where ""it's pretty clear"" that way at all. I'd like to hear some specific points (beyond that one line of dialog, which I interpret differently below). Always seemed in *Deadly Assassin* like it was very much more like a Roman Emperor type deal than the American system. There was obviously not a regular election cycle, for one. The Time Lords in *DA* definitely act like a President retiring is an extremely rare act for there to be any kind of changeover in power. I think the Doctor is shocked that Borusa doesn't *ever* want to retire, but it wouldn't be shocking if Borusa wanted to retire say, a century or two into his last life, as it would make more sense for the Presidency, as it is not regularly an elected position (remember in DA that the President names his successor, hardly like the American system at all), to be the last public office one would obtain in Time Lord society, and one would ostensibly hold such a position until they were just about unable to hold it any longer. Now, yes, both my theory and your other friends' are based on inference, as very little of it is spelled out for us. Perhaps Borusa was only on his 10th or 11th body whereas President Nameless in Deadly Assassin was in his 12th or 13th body when elected and *definitely* in his 13th when he was assassinated, this being more regular as Borusa wasn't elected for his seniority. He didn't seem to be elected at all, just the last man standing after Goth was out of the picture and the Doctor obviously didn't want the job. I think there's a decent argument either way, but I think the evidence leans my way.

Time Lord politics are *definitely* not based on the American system. Maybe the use of the word ""President"" confused your friend. Time Lord Presidents, if we take *Deadly Assassin* as our example, are not regularly elected (most are appointed by their predecessors. Yeah, sounds real American to me) and do not seem to have a limit (except for death, retirement or, in the case of the Doctor, willful absence from their post. These are the only examples we are ever presented with. At no point in the classic series is a President told by the High Council, ""well, Lord President, your term is up"" or will be up, or has been up. There is *no* such scenario ever.) on how long they can stay in office. Borusa had, in fact, been President across 3 regenerations by the time of the Five Doctors, and no one seemed to think it was time for him to step down just yet. Though it was obvious that he was feeling his age and did not ever want to relinquish power.

edit: Also, the Doctor's response could also be seen as him not wanting to believe that Borusa wanted immortality, and trying to rationalize what Borusa was saying. ""Oh, you want to be President for all your remaining regenerations?! (right? right?! because that's ok I guess, and you were my teacher and tutor and stuff and I don't want you to be a megalomaniac who wants to be immortal..)"" Remember how fond the Doctor was of Borusa in the Invasion of Time? Of course he would want to keep thinking of Borusa as a good man who hadn't gone power mad completely. I have always interpreted this scene in exactly that way since I was 9 years old, so I'm sure many others do too. Notice that no one said Borusa couldn't serve as president until he breathed his last breath, just that it seemed out of the ordinary to take it to that extreme.

Honestly, if you have any *actual* good points to refute any of this, I'd like to hear them :D :D

In fact, the fact that that person thinks that any of it is in any way similar to the American system beyond the title of ""President"", then you should have instantly called them out on it. ""which it was vaguely set up to mimic"" my ass. Where is the evidence?!?!? I mean, Mubarak was ""President"" of Egypt. And we all know *that* was reaaaal similar to America there.... I guess you just trust that they had some line of reasoning, which they obviously didn't really back up at all. There is absolutely no evidence ""that Presidents have a specific time period they are president for"" whatsoever, presented at any point in the entire classic series period. 

""They made a point."" HA! They made a very shady point, backed up with hopes and dreams that they made up with *zero* evidence imo.

Evaluating what detail matters and what is insignificant is difficult. So with a decent level of creativity a person can pull from minute details possible plots and potential plot twists. Some are utterly wrong, some are frighteningly accurate. 

The point is this; if this sort of speculation, or overanalysis, amuses and entertains then by all means people should read, write, and generally engage with it, to whatever degree they want.

The council have already fitted his flat out with a disabled shower and toilet.  They have offered to re-house him in more suitable accommodation, which he has declined.  They are providing the services of occupational therapists to help him.  To top it all, they have already said that they are in the process of consulting with other tenants to see if they are amenable to having the ramp fitted.

In the mean time, he and six other residents have raised a petition to the council and the Surrey Comet have sent a photographer and/or reporter around to interview him about it.

Would it really be that difficult for one of these concerned neighbours, the Surrey Comet, or his step-son for that matter, to pop down to the local timber yard, pick up a few off-cuts of wood and fashion a ramp a little more permanent than the temporary one made out of scaffolding boards.

&gt; * (b)conduct which facilitates the commission, preparation or instigation of such acts, or which is intended to do so

Also, he'd have likely been better off citing the PACE (Police and Criminal Evidence) act for mobile phone confiscation, as an item suspected of containing evidence of a crime can be immediately confiscated without any allegations of terrorism, or even any other crime.

What should happen is for you to comply with any reasonable request, including stopping the taking of photographs on their premesis and/or leaving the premesis.

If the security guard starts to assert liberties that he doesn't have, such as deleting photographs you've already taken, or threatening to call the police if you don't comply with things he cannot force you to produce, then you simply quietly leave the premesis.

If he tries to stop you, he is committing a criminal offence unless he has reasonable suspicion of a crime being committed by you, which will need to be proven based on evidence. If he proceeds with a citizen's arrest and reasonable suspicion cannot be produced, he himself will have committed a criminal offence which you can prosecute against him and/or his employer.

Always avoid a physical confrontation best you can, and if he places himself in your way as an obstacle and makes it difficult for you to leave, do not try to leave by means of force.

I agree not everyone has the money to do them unpaid. I would however, like to point out that almost all my mates from uni would spend summers lolling around, holidays etc, living off the end of their student loan and living at home, whilst I worked (albeit unpaid).

For the others, who actually graft at real low paid jobs during uni holiday time then it's a trade off.  (because thats when you should be doing internships) Those are the people. who, IMO are really being abused by the internship phenomenon. As it means they will have retail, bar whatever experience, but lack the know-how of office politics, writing skills etc.

Internships are a form of slavery, yes. Unfortunately - our young people are graduating from school and uni with really crap skills. A few months in an office can really turn things around. I've seen it happen many times (including the office I now work, where we have a very content, unpaid intern.) her skills have rocketed up, and she will probably be offered a job soon.

The problem is, in my view - that if you start having to pay interns, even minimum wage, companies will stop offering them.

So basically, what you're saying is that if companies aren't allowed slaves they won't hire anyone to do the work of the slaves? Honestly, I doubt that. Even if it's true though, it's not an argument for slavery.

Interns are useful to a company, they take care of various duties, while being trained up to company standards, are cheap as hell compared with regular employees, and practically give the company ""dibs"" on someone who'll soon be entering into the start of about 45 years of work.

I'm 3rd year into a 5 year Mchem degree, I will probably never manage to do an internship, as I have rent, bills, and living expenses to pay, so work a menial job over the summer, so yes, I'm one of the ones in the crappy situation.

* Firstly public sector employment is not uniform, and tends to be concentrated in areas of already high unemployment (largely in the North).

* Public sector spending also supports private sector jobs, largely in services. Therefore unemployment on this scale could easily cause wider job losses. The union figures for this are an overestimate, but this is still important.

* Whether or not this reduces the deficit will depend on entirely on whether or not the private sector can re-employ these workers, and how quickly this can be done. If they sit on the dole, then not only are they drawing government money anyway, but more importantly are spending far far less, and are not paying tax. This is why public sector deficit is so hard to cut during an economic downturn, and why many are so concerned about the current narrative that priorities spending cuts over growth. The question is not whether or not it is desirable to return to a balanced budget (of course it is!) but if this is possible, and if it is possible what the cost will be for our long term economic prospects.

Given that unemployment is already at 2.51 million, and that most of the private sector is also cutting back their spending to preserve often slim margins, there seems little chance of public sector workers finding employment again quickly.

You think people don't work part time? Part time work tops up meagre student loans during the semesters, full time work pays for life outside of termtime.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt;Half the problem is that people are operating from a misguided position that the NHS represents the best possible example of a 21st century health care system and that there is simply no need to reform.

Empirically, it is one of the worlds better healthcare systems. The oft quoted statistic is its favorable comparison with the US private sector based model both in terms of overall spending and accessibility. 

If this bill was about cutting bureaucracy it wouldn't be meeting such opposition. The opposition is to the opening up of the health service to private providers. Lining the pockets of share holders should not be a public spending priority, and the assumption that the private sector will increase efficiencies is based more on ideology than on evidence. 

Nobody would make the case that the NHS is efficient as it could be, particularly in the case of procuring drugs (often spending vast sums on branded drugs identical to unbranded drugs at a fraction of the cost). *However* there is a reason the NHS is so bureaucratic. There have to be vast amounts of checks and balances, because of the huge scope to do people real harm.

1/10 people are harmed by their healthcare in the UK. This is nearer to 1/3 for elderly people. This is not because health professionals are bad at what they do, simply that the scope for human error in healthcare is massive. Hence the amount of scrutiny involved. A more useful reform for improving health in the UK would be protecting NHS whistle blowers (who are currently systemically victimised by management) or banning cigarettes outright.

20% APR? where the hell are you getting your loans from? Even Ocean Finance offer loans at 11%, many others are significantly lower. Please don't start exaggerating to make your case look superior when a quick search will prove you wrong.

That's alarming, and also a good reason why you should shop around.

true,Ivashkin,null,null,"&gt; Empirically, it is one of the worlds better healthcare systems. The oft quoted statistic is its favorable comparison with the US private sector based model both in terms of overall spending and accessibility.

The data I have says it's about average for Europe, the EHCI reports place it at around 15 out of 30ish, and have for a few years now. So it is definitely at the top of the world tables. When it comes to the NHS vs the US system, the quality of care is probably better in the US, but the accessibility is very poor compared to the NHS, and it costs way more per-capita (although a lot of this appears to be bureaucracy and insurance firms exploiting people). So the NHS isn't bad, its one of the worlds best health care systems but it's not the best.

&gt; If this bill was about cutting bureaucracy it wouldn't be meeting such opposition. The opposition is to the opening up of the health service to private providers. Lining the pockets of share holders should not be a public spending priority, and the assumption that the private sector will increase efficiencies is based more on ideology than on evidence.

If you look at the healthcare systems in the EU which are based on the Bismark model rather than the Beveridge model, they often include private provision of public healthcare, however they are also nations which appear to take regulation of the sector as something that is actually important, where as regulation of private firms providing public services in the UK is piss poor at best. There is also a case to argue for vested interests within the NHS being opposed to any reform tbh. 

&gt; Nobody would make the case that the NHS is efficient as it could be, particularly in the case of procuring drugs (often spending vast sums on branded drugs identical to unbranded drugs at a fraction of the cost). However there is a reason the NHS is so bureaucratic. There have to be vast amounts of checks and balances, because of the huge scope to do people real harm.
&gt;
&gt; 1/10 people are harmed by their healthcare in the UK. This is nearer to 1/3 for elderly people. This is not because health professionals are bad at what they do, simply that the scope for human error in healthcare is massive. Hence the amount of scrutiny involved. A more useful reform for improving health in the UK would be protecting NHS whistle blowers (who are currently systemically victimised by management) or banning cigarettes outright.

You raise an interesting point, one thing that typifies the high-performing health care systems in Europe is a de-centralized model. And although we did go down that road with the SHA's and PCT's, I think more could be done in that area. The larger the organization, the more inefficiency becomes inherent, I've seen this first hand in the private sector and nothing I've seen about the public sector makes me believe that it would be any different. And this does link back into the scale issues that seem to be inherent in the Beveridge system. 

As for the reforms as they are, I want to see a fundamental review of what it is we want the NHS to provide, how we want it to be provided, and what is required to fund it. As things stand I think the reforms are being rushed through to score political points rather than to deliver much needed reform. And if we don't do this now, then the EOL care for the 'boomers is going to destroy the NHS, especially as they don't want to pay for it themselves and the model of the current working population paying to care for those who have retired is unsustainable given the demographics problem we are facing.

&gt;Management for setting up rules against photography

Employers and Employees need guidelines that allow them to deal with problems, for example if a person *is* causing a nuisance with their camera. These rules are not meant to be followed religiously and in my experience rarely are.

&gt;Iced-cream seller who complained to security

There are always members of staff who follow the rules too rigidly. They are a pain in the ass for everyone, including managers and security. It's also possible that the guy was taking pictures of them and their grievance was authentic.

&gt; Security who didn't ignore it

One of the roles of security is to support retail workers when dealing with problem customers. Personal experience working in a busy retail environment and having to deal with nuisance customers on a regular basis has shown me how valuable a reliable and supportive security guard is. Most security guards will be polite and respectful to members of the public. They had no right to ask for the photos to be deleted though.

&gt;Police who didn't tell security they were being irrational

In my experience the police will usually support management and security in situations like this, perhaps this is wrong. Though very often I've seen the police having a word with the manager of a store afterwards if they feel the situation has been handled wrongly in the first place by the security guard.

&gt;Police ranks for training their officers to treat photography like a criminal act

The whole terrorist act has been an absolute nightmare. It was a terrible set of laws that have led, predictably, to situations like this where it is used, incorrectly, to threaten members of the public. You won't get any argument from me this is wrong.

I'd just like to add that I don't think we get the full picture of what actually happened here. Perhaps Mr. White was taking pictures that could have been perceived to be inappropriate. Perhaps he behaved aggressively when confronted. Or perhaps he has been the victim of a lack of common sense on the part of the staff.

&gt;public perception is that these rules are fine

The outcry seems to suggest the opposite to me 4000 likes on Facebook, most people here on Reddit saying the behaviour of the authorities was wrong. Back to my original point, people have has much common sense today as they did 50 years ago.

I'll try and make it brief (edit: lol, didn't happen), because it's quite an involved tale.

I was on a bus from San Francisco to San Matteo, sitting in an aisle seat behind a man with a DSLR and next to my (female, i'm male) friend. This man is taking inane pictures out of the window for most of the way, which i found a bit curious- he would take about 10 pictures in quick succession of the road, there was literally nothing to see.

Anyway, about halfway through the journey, some 10-11 year old girls get on, it was hot (obv) and one was wearing hot pants and the other a short skirt. They come and stand just in front of the man in the gap where the door is. The man starts somewhat surreptitiously taking pictures of these girls' arses. They weren't quite upskirt, though I think he was going for that angle. He probably took about 10 in all, my eyes caught those of another passenger who had also realized what was going down. In between these shots he was taking LOADS more pictures of nothing in particular outside. Anyway, we reach the bus station at San Matteo, where we all were planning to get off. As the girls rush off he goes for the grand finale pic at which point i try to take his camera forcibly from him, tell him he can't take pictures like that and go and tell the bus driver who calls the police. 

Two problems then occurred 1) the bus driver locks down the bus, none of us can leave until the police arrive (it was sweltering) 2) the guy had  deleted all the pics.

When the police arrived, I knew they couldn't do anything. I'm not even sure what I wanted them to do, I still can't work out in my own head if what he was doing was illegal, and moreover wrong. I mean, they were there for all to see, but then again he was taking photos of their arses. ERUGH IT'S DOING MY BLOODY HEAD IN AS I TYPE IT. I guess it was a snap judgement I made at the time, I felt SUPER uncomfortable with what he was doing. Put it this way, I'd be fine with someone taking a photo of me in public, but not of my arse. Though it is a fan-fucking-tastic arse. All the time I have been knowingly photographed in public by a stranger, I've been asked permission first, also i'm not an 11 year old girl in hotpants.

I feel ashamed to say this, but it didn't help that he looked like a stereotypical nonce, I mean he could have been in the Brass Eye special on paedophilia and it would have looked OTT. This definitely shouldn't have informed what I did, but in reality probably did. 

So the police came, chatted to the man, looked through his photos and obviously found nothing, when I spoke to the gentleman who I had the aforementioned ""knowing look"" with, asking if he would talk to the police too,  just to confirm my story he replied with ""I know what I saw, man"" and then walked off. The police told me they found a whole load of bizarre blurred pictures of NOTHING but as expected, no hot jb action.

I'm partly posting this for cathartic reasons, I still feel hugely uncomfortable that I may have done the wrong thing, I- like reddit in general it seems- deplore the moral panic around paedophilia, and I support (within reason) the rights of people to take photos of anything and everything.

Two things stike me about this bus journey debacle though, firstly that I found what he was doing so morally wrong that I went WAY out of my comfort-zone to do something about it and secondly the general apathy I received from the rest of the bus, at least a couple of whom (excluding Johnny Tightlips) must have seen what was happening.

Since, however, I've had my doubts about all of this, it still niggles in the back of my mind when I think about it. I'd love to hear your thoughts on both the legal and moral side of it, reddit. Just bear in mind that I felt genuinely compelled to do something about it, and that as far as I can remember has only happened once before in public, and I certainly wasn't standing alone then.

Sorry for the stream of consciousness ramble, i kept weighing it up in my mind as i was typing it. Pah.

**tl;dr**- man on bus tries to snap some jb, i go ninja and save the world but have second thoughts.

edit: oh WOW that was longer than i meant it to be. oh well, at least it bugged me at lunch some more. I'd put that to the back of my mind! I guess there are worse problems.

EDIT - hmm, maybe I got excited too soon. 

&gt; It is a perpetual myth that there are no trespass laws in Scotland. Even before the recent Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994, trespass has long been a delict (civil wrong) which is remediable by the remedies of interdict and damages. However, The Land Reform (Scotland) Act 2003 amends the Trespass (Scotland) Act 1865 and establishes a statutory right of access.

&gt; Certain types of trespass have been criminal since the Trespass (Scotland) Act 1865 was passed, an Act no-one has ever heard of. Section 3 makes it an offence for any person to lodge in any premises, or occupy or encamp on any land, being private property, without the consent of the owner or legal occupier. Admittedly this section envisages a degree of permanency which will not be present in every situation of trespass.

&gt;That's alarming, and also a good reason why you should shop around.

Sainsbury's offer 12.9%, after that it's the post office at 14.9%, then A&amp;L at 15.9% and so on. So you can get a 12.9% loan, if they accept your application, if your application isn't accepted, then you're realistically looking somewhere between 15% and 20%. I'm mostly just pointing this out, because it doesn't have much of an effect upon my argument, but I think perhaps you're assuming cheap easy credit is available to students which just isn't there.

&gt;Not true, if an internship has no value to the person wanting to do it then why would they do it? People are not being forced in to doing them, they are choosing to do them.

They would do it because without one you're at a disadvantage, I never said it had no value, I said that companies were using applicants immorally by not paying them.

&gt;Again, consider what an internship is supposed to offer - work experience for people with little experience in industry. It is costly for a company to setup up payroll, tax information etc for someone who is going to be there for 1 or 2 months in a non-standard job.

Companies benefit from them though, by having willing applicants who are quite likely to take up a job offer (so long as both sides were happy) without the company having to go through the recruitment process, and being able to hire a known quantity. Also they benefit because they have someone doing work, admitedly probably the lowest quality of employee they have, but then even when they got paid they were being paid a tiny fraction of what regular employees earnt.

My point is simply that it is immoral to hire people to carry out work without paying them, it is a negative trend for the UK as these internships are just going to get longer and longer, until we reach an equilibrium whereby companies can find enough kids of wealthy people who are ""good enough"" and who'll work for a year or two for free before having to be paid.

Furthermore beyond simply being immoral, it appears to be illegal and the sooner we start seeing civil suits about the matter the better.",0,1318257012,null,0,true,0,c2qarab,t3_l6yrn,t1_c2qarab,t1_c2qaj09,1427711221,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

I'm sure you were running on emotion but actually grabbing his camera could have easily ended up with you being arrested for assault or attempted robbery if he'd had the mind to report you for it; a quiet word with him to let him know what you thought he was *allegedly* doing would have been more appropriate than what you did. I'm not taking sides on the issue as i wasn't there to judge, just pointing out some things.

Also any half decent photographer who cared to learn how, could recover deleted pictures from a memory card, so he probably just recovered them later; you can even by memory cards with wifi in them that transmit taken photos to any other wifi device with storage like an iPhone (which can even then relay the pictures to your home server via 3G) or even a laptop in a rucksack, making your efforts futile anyway.

Since this is a UK reddit i will say that if you are in a public space (this can include private property that is open to the public like a shopping center in this article) in the UK then you are free to take pictures of whomever or whatever you want without the need for forms or releases, both adult and child alike. The only time you may get into trouble is if you harass the person you are photographing, but this is a separate issue, and taking a photograph without permission is not considered harassment itself either; can you imagine how many paparazzi would be in jail if it were?

Now you could say: Why don't you just check your balance when your abroad on-line, but to be honest, when you're touring you don't really have a chance to do anything but your job and trying to get internet access on a tour bus is bloody expensive and can lead to a drunken night on facebook costing you a few hundred quid... so it's best to just leave it.

Also, this isn't to say he is a bad counter tenor, its just that he isn't putting in the effort to meld with the orchestra. Soloists typically don't have a lot of time to practice with the conductor and orchestra. I know for big productions like this the soloists aren't there for most of the rehearsals. They are typically relied upon to learn the music independently and they show up for the last 2ish rehearsals before the performance. As you can imagine, singing as a soloist means you fly around the country(s) doing lots of gigs with lots of conductors, as compared to the in house orchestra's which will learn 3 or more productions over the course of a season.

All that being said, I have been in productions where the solists have melded a LOT better with the orchestra, os it is definitely possible if the work is put in.

true,Manic_Miner,eng-somerset,Somerset,"&gt;    RBS is where I checked, £4000 loan on a non-royalties account comes with a representative APR of 20.9%.

&gt;That's alarming, and also a good reason why you should shop around.

It's alarming but not quite a representative example unfortunately. 

The high APR is because it's a non-account holder loan for a sum that's below the terms of the loan (RBS offers online loans of between £7,500 to £14,950). 

The higher rate is because they won't make the kind of profit off the £4000 that they will off their actual offering, even if you get the longest possible repayment plan of 5 years.

true,Axius,uk,United Kingdom,"I would say that if you were talking about the idea of a British identity, one of the first things to point out has to be the lack of a solid 'British' identity, with the Scottish, Welsh and English having some wildly varying characteristics at the same time as a peculiar fondness and similarity for each other. If anything, it's kind of like we're a set of countries that are in an abusive relationship we want to leave but we all need each other more than we want to realise. It's a love/hate relationship.

While I understand there is an attempt at satire in your writing which more or less works, this says nothing about the actual British identity, which can be debated to not really exist at all and in many cases is argued to be an English creation to rationalise the relationship with Scotland and Wales.

I would suggest the best way to answer such a question is to start by looking at the question - it wants you to detail British and/or American identity. Since you're focusing on British identity, what you need to do is ask what it means to be British within Britain, not British from outside Britain. Identity generally is better read as a self-defined statement than an exterior perspective, and you will find that the Scottish and the English are separate identities that both fall under the header of 'British' but are both different in many ways. Even within the categories, regional variation changes social norms and the likes.

Very few people I know in the UK would detail themselves as a Brit. The 'home nationality' takes precedence there. For example, I know Americans that call the English 'Brits' and the Scottish 'Scots' - clearly a contradiction in terms of identity, since Britain consists of the whole British Isles, but it carries the significance of showing how strongly the Scottish desire a separate identity.

I feel the humour in your writing works, but hopefully I've pointed out that identity can be defined and understood in many ways. It's just much easier to take it from an internal perspective than write about it from an outside angle since, as others have said, without knowing how we all relate to one-another, it can become somewhat offensive.",0,1318276628,null,0,true,0,c2qdi0f,t3_l71xq,t1_c2qdi0f,t3_l71xq,1427712514,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

The canny observer might be able to figure out that it's the Doctor, but that doesn't mean the Doctor himself has to tell everyone. Like at Stonehenge in ""The Pandorica Opens"" for example, or even ""The Eleventh Hour"" where the Doctor makes it very public as to who is responsible for keeping things together.

He can't change how his past incarnations have dealt with things, of course, so as far as a linear progression from cause to effect goes, that's already set.

This is the deleted text

&gt;Following various postings on social media websites and stories in the traditional media, Braehead would like to set the record straight on an incident involving a man taking photographs of a child in the centre, on Friday October 7.

&gt;Retail staff at an ice cream stall in Braehead became suspicious after they saw a male shopper taking photographs of a child sitting at their counter. The staff thought the man had also been taking photographs of them and they alerted one of the centre’s security staff.

&gt;The member of security staff approached the man and politely asked if he had been taking photographs. At no time in the initial conversation was the member of our security staff informed by the man that the child in question was his daughter.
Because of the nature of the incident, police became involved and also spoke to the man.

&gt;Our priority is always to maintain a safe and enjoyable environment for all our shoppers and retailers. The member of our security staff acted in good faith.

&gt;Like most shopping centres, we have a ‘no photography’ policy in the mall for two reasons. First, to protect the privacy of staff and shoppers. as we are sure shoppers would not want strangers taking photographs of them or their children whilethey were in the mall.

&gt;Secondly and sadly, we live in a world of potential threats from terrorists and everyone is being urged by the police to be vigilant at all times. It is not uncommon for those intending to make some kind of attack to take photographs of their intended target as part of their planning before the event.

&gt;However, it is not our intention to - and we do not - stop innocent family members taking pictures. Discretion is used at all times.

&gt;Although Friday’s incident had nothing to do with a potential terrorist attack, the two retail assistants and the member of our security staff were faced with a situation they genuinely thought was suspicious. They witnessed a man taking photographs of a child, unaware that the man and the child were related.

I love Doctor Who and Top Gear but the BBC shows that could be called masterpieces and must watches are Civilization, Planet Earth, Human Earth, Blue Planet, The World At War and The Ascent of Man.

The only American TV show I can think of that was as ground breaking and significant as any of the above is Cosmos. Cosmos IMO is one of the most important TV shows to ever be created, I don't think the impact of it can be fully measured over the decades.

Entertainment is one thing but making something that educates and informs is something else entirely. When raised to its highest form entertainment becomes an artform. The BBC in the past decades have made documentaries that are simply achievements.

I think in the entertainment department the US wins hands down and always will. Too many people still read in Britain. Readers make life difficult for TV producers because they have to do something different to get attention. This is why there are so many comedy shows in Britain, they are one of the few types of shows that get readers watching.

&gt;Since this is a UK reddit i will say that if you are in a public space (this can include private property that is open to the public like a shopping center in this article) in the UK then you are free to take pictures of whomever or whatever you want without the need for forms or releases, both adult and child alike.

They've just explained (the BBC) that it's be okay for you to take pictures of friends and family in a public space (i.e. the high street), but not strangers. Which is obviously bullshit. As you say, in a public space, you can photograph what you like (however, I do think they're within their rights to ask you to leave a shopping centre because it's private property and they can say not taking photos is a condition of entry). 

I'm a photographer and the only time I've ever had my collar felt by the cops was a few years ago when taking pictures at Grangemouth oil refinery. I was on public land when I was taking them (the refinery and the equipment/plant is enormous), and within a few minutes of getting out my car, a security van came up and asked what I was doing. I explained I was taking some arty industrial shots of the plant, and the guy said it wasn't allowed and the police had been called. He was actually pretty cool about it and told me I was free to leave before they arrived, but if they saw my car (security had passed on my registration number), I'd get stopped and questioned, so I figured I might as well wait. He told me it happened quite a lot, and I asked who I needed permission from, he told me the media centre, but that they never gave it. 

The police got there about five minutes later. They told me Grangemouth is considered vital infrastructure so they're quite touchy about it. They asked to see the photos on my camera, which I showed them, but there was no threat to take it off me, or any suggestion I'd done anything outrageous or would be detained longer than it took to establish I wasn't a terrorist. They did ask me to delete the photos, which I did. They took my details, which I assume they checked against my car registration, and when they found I was from just along the road, let me go, and told me to leave the refinery. 

I guess I could've made a fuss, pointed out I was on public ground and refused to delete the photos, but given the nature of what I was photographing, I felt it was all fairly reasonable. I'm white, male, and it was in my late twenties. 

I'd much rather have an argument and make a fuss if some dickhead started telling me I couldn't take his (or anyone else's) photo in the middle of Edinburgh city centre because it was invading his 'privacy'.

I restated what I considered to be a ""point"" made by the other guy because you seemed to think the ""point"" was comparing the presidency to the American system. It's not. It was the Borusa line which you then responded to. So there's no need to call me obtuse, I didn't misunderstand.

Anyways, here's the next response from the other guy:

&gt;My feeling that it was based on the American system came from the fact that the Deadly Assassin in general (and according to writer Robert Holmes) said that it was influenced by it (along with things like the CIA and dissolution (sic) without representation is against the constitution). But you're wasting effort trying to rationalise ""You want to remain president for all your remaining regenerations??""

&gt;But ultimately the point you make is a little laughable (if presidents can name their successor, are you telling me that they have to actually say it or it doesn't count? Seriously?) The only person we see on screen someone being made president is the Doctor - once by election, once by emergency appointment. In The Trial of a Time Lord, the Doctor is encouraged to run for president. There's far more evidence to suggest that Presidents are elected, and it seems more likely that the DA President was naming his acting successor as he was stepping down before his time was up.

It was pretty obvious that Goth would have been the popular choice if an election had been in the cards, and he would have had no reason to ""get in bed"" with the Master so to speak had it been otherwise. Unless I've missed something in the 20-odd times I've seen DA, Goth does not indicate that President Nameless had any dirt on him, just that he wasn't going to be named successor. Goth *killed the guy* to avoid him naming his *temporary* successor, and had only to wait for an election cycle to bloodlessly and legitimately seize power?! And, of all the incarnations, Four doesn't point this out to him?! Laughable? At least my version doesn't destroy the motivation for an entire story arc. And yes, generally heads of state *do* have to ""say it or it doesn't count"". Seriously. Roman Emperors, real ones who really existed and really were real heads of state were actually in the real world killed to avoid them formally stating who they wanted as successor, in real life.

Again, I retstate that I do not at any time a) read what the writers have to say about anything b) care what one writer, even Robert Holmes, thinks. (I'd also like to see where and when Holmes said this, and in what context) I form my opinions exclusively by what I see onscreen, period. And yeah, I'm a little cranky today because Columbus Day screwed me out of being able to accomplish something today and work (when I wrote my first long diatribe) was really filled with bs today.

true,Philomathematics,hartnell,Hartnell,"Well... yes. That's true, good point. Let's see if a flowchart would help.

For most people, time is viewed like this:

Event A -&gt; Event B -&gt; Event C -&gt; Event D -&gt; Event F -&gt; Event G -&gt; etc.

But for the Doctor, things go like this (very roughly):

Event A -&gt; Event D -&gt; Event F -&gt; Event B* (alternate reality B, that is) -&gt; Event G -&gt; Event Q -&gt; Event pre-A -&gt; Event H -&gt; Event D -&gt; etc.

I'm doing this off the top of my head so I don't know if it actually lines up, but let's say that Event B was going to be the Doctor's death, but Event B* is the reality that splits after River tries to rewrite a fixed point. Things happen, and we get to Event G by the end of ""The Wedding of River Song."" From Event G forward, the Doctor is trying to move back into the shadows. Since he's still bouncing all over time and space, however, linear-time observers may not notice a difference. And even people like River who may know the Doctor from the future (both linear and subjective) may have trouble distinguishing.

But his attempt to recede back and fade from memory is perhaps more for the Doctor's own sake than anything else. He's garnered a reputation as a great warrior all across time and space, popping up here and there and doing stuff. Those are fixed points for him now, but if he spends more of his time now trying to keep a low profile, perhaps he can build a different reputation, a quieter and gentler one. Or perhaps he doesn't travel quite as much or as obviously, so that the gaps between his appearances (from most people's perspectives) grow longer and longer. In either case, what I'm getting at is that the Doctor may be trying to rehabilitate his image by doing less of the Big Damn Hero thing and more of the running and keeping out of the way thing. If he can propagate that reputation, the legends about the Doctor perhaps become conflicted, and maybe even fade out of collective memory.

As for other time travelers like River, they're seeing him out of order too, so it's more confusing than normal because both parties are in four-dimensional motion, backwards and forwards and whatever other direction. Same idea applies, perhaps - his personal-timeline encounters with them are marked by more discretion than valor, which makes it confusing as to which Doctor you're getting when you call on him (see: *Silence in the Library/Forest of the Dead*). It appears that his character is inconsistent, but the more times he opts to run than fight, perhaps the more he can claim that those fighting days were bad days for him.

Anyways I'd much rather the money to be used to help out a father of two etc. Someone that people rely on rather than someone who has had their day and is simply waiting for their corpse to be stuck somewhere. I'm one that doesn't ""get"" funerals and have no religious affiliation  so this is simply my opinion and peoples wishes are peoples wishes but I think a better way to avoid the burden of cost is to simply not have anything fancy. 

I plan on going down the George Carling route and avoid any sort of service then just get a simple cremation. No need for a headstone, waste of money, I'm guessing you can't be forced to get one.

I've had this internal debate with myself that if I get to a point and I'm still the same hard working single guy that likes a drink and one day I get the news I've developed cancer or something would I want to take money out the NHS to try and sort me out when it could be used for someone such as the sole bread earner of a family. The fact I've put plenty in the pot is irrelevant as far as I'm concerned. Simply a case of some people really are of more importance, for lack of a better word, than others. 

This seems to be going off on a tangent here but I think what I'm trying to get at is I think people need to stick a cold value on themselves, fictively speaking, then ask themselves if it's truly worth taking out the pot when it could be better spent. I'd hate to think that a father/mother etc can't get the treatment because the Trust just doesn't have the funding while I've been all sorted out and just continue to head down the pub and do what guys do.

Not really sure where all this came from. It's late and I'm probably just tired and venting. I can't see many people agreeing with or even getting what I'm trying to say and really looking at it, it just comes across as a pseudo-selfless act.

I dunno, I can't be a Moffatt fanboy because I personally think he should have left River a mystery forever after SiL, but I can't fault him for trying to move her (very complex) story forward without endless character exposition.

Definitely have a point there, but on the other hand, I would've liked a *mention* of her before. Now I definitely wouldn't have wanted to meet her earlier in the series, but a mention would be nice. Otherwise, it felt like Moffat just created this past regeneration backstory to wow us 15 minutes later with ""She's really River!"". Now I really liked LKH, but that right there shows he doesn't plan everything.

I'm glad River is expanded on, but I don't like her huge plot arc that the whole show centered around. I'm pretty 50/50 on my plot/character. I loved Big Bang/Pandorica, but I also loved Vincent and the Doctor. I do like all the wibbly wobbly end of time stuff and the Doctor death, but the way it centers around River being this head-over-heels psycho just wasn't my cup of tea.

Plus it also brings up the questions: do we assume the Silence blew up the TARDIS (and why), or is that yet to be answered? (because it was never explicitly stated). Plus, what is Madame Kovarian's relationship with the Silence (subordinate, boss, partner?) and what is her (and possibly the Silence's) motivations.

Now we can assume it was the Silence who blew up the TARDIS, ignore Kovarian (and her lack of character), and assume the Silence and her would naturally want to stop the dangerous Doctor. But we've still got the moment where Silence Falls, and the Trenzalore-Fall of the 11th to contend with.

Don't know if this will be expanded on either, but will we see River when she's training with the Silence, and will we see her as baby Melody?

true,[deleted],null,null,"Ah, I think I get what you're asking now. Took me a minute (wibbly-wobbly).

The Doctor dropped Amy and Rory off in TGC, at which point she still 'knew' [spoiler](/s ""he was going to die""). Next we see of her (ignoring the all-time-together-reality), was in her backyard when River turns up, and Amy knows all about everything that has happened in this reality, and the alternate one.

How did she know? Damn good question. Wibbly-wobbly.

The only way I can (hopefully) logically explain it is like this (but this is not cannon, just my opinion, and forgive me if I lose track):

Everything we saw in the opening two episode happened as we saw it. [spoiler](/s ""The Doctor really did die""). However, because he also called a previous version of himself to meet with the scooby-gang just afterwards, he was effectively assigning his younger self the task of trying to change time to avoid [spoiler](/s ""his later death"").

Therefore, everything from that point on was, at least potentially, a new timeline. At the point he dropped off Amy and Rory at the end of TGC, he still hadn't changed time, so [spoiler](/s ""his actual death"") still had/will happen(ed).

Of course, by this time, he was already aware of [spoiler](/s ""his impending death""), as was River, so the version of that actually happened was the one where [spoiler](/s ""River avoided killing him""), and so ripped a hole in time and space and created the all-time-together universe we saw)

He then (in the original timeline) went to meet various people, including [spoiler](/s ""a Teselecta""), and came up with his plan to avoid [spoiler](/s ""his death""), which he then informed River of (""look into my eye"").

He then went to the beach as before (but this time [spoiler](/s ""as a Teselecta"")), and the encounter we saw between him and River happened (which was obviously different than the original encounter in Ep1, because he now had explained to River in the all-time-together timeline what he was doing), and the all-time-together reality therefore never happened this time around.

After this other reality was destroyed (by rewriting *again* what happened at the beach), we had a **new** new reality, where the Doctor [spoiler](/s ""never died in the first place""), but everybody involved had all the memories of each previous reality.

Considering that it was optioned for little money and was made on a shoe string budget and did marginally well, the intent seemed more to be that they wanted the US audience to learn of Doctor Who as it wasn't a 100% sure thing that they would make millions.

Amicus Productions could not afford to finance a film on this scale on their own, so they were financed by AARU on the condition that only AARU's name appeared on the credits.  Amicus while still operating made B-movie Horror Films, that was their specialty.  Not huge money makers.  I think they made movies that they liked, not what would make them money.

The director seemed like a nice guy.  He would pay the child actor who played the daughter a shilling every time she did a scene in one take.  She got so good at it that they didn't continue that practice in the sequel.  That practice was started because they rarely had the resources to do multiple takes, they were short on time, and budget.

I guess I just figure since we all bought Amy and Rory's romance without any previous exposition of precisely *how* Rory got out of the friendzone that buying the whole Mels package along with said exposition works pretty well, considering. (Now that I think about it, we buy *all* of the relationships in the last couple Series with surprisingly little exposition)

Yeah, I didn't like River at first. Then she grew on me and I liked the idea that she was going to be a villain in her past. Was really looking forward to that reveal, and a real exploration of this character that so many people thought was such a heroine. Now I'm not really sure because the whole thing felt so rushed, like Moffatt backed off the idea of really showing her psycho-evil side too much so the audience wouldn't find her too distasteful in the end.

Well, I think it's mostly taken shape unless you start to ask really bizarre questions. There is no reason to believe that Kovarian's relationship with the Silent creatures (remember the Silence is the whole organization and the Silents are specifically the memory-proof suit-aliens) is any different in the ""real"" universe than in the frozen time one, so she is definitely an upper-tier member/leader(?) of the Silence, but a subordinate lackey of the Silents. 
I have a couple theories on the Silents (I think we know enough about the Silence. See this gets confusing.) Leaving out who I really hope is behind them (Omega), I think they basically are a race who wants to control all races across all time, or they are agents of someone who does (unless the raspy old man voice heard in the console room was just for some kind of emphasis and wasn't a clue or anything). I *think* at the very least that particular question will be answered and will wrap up the TARDIS explosion question along with it, satisfyingly or not, by the end of Series 7. 

Then again, who knows? 

I don't think River ever ""trained"" with the Silence. I think it was all put in her head way early on and they just kept her in the orphanage to be found because for them it just had to play out that way so that the Lake Silencio thing could happen. They didn't technically need to train her or anything, but they needed everything to go that exact way because that's how it always went so everyone ended up where they were supposed to be in the fixed point. I think basically Moffatt &amp; co avoided River actually being evil because too many people liked her so they made it unavoidable fixed point timey wimey fate instead of her being deep down really twisted or evil since the audience would have freaked the fuck out big time. I do think making her truly twisted and evil was the original plan and they backed off of it when they realized the fans would freak, hence why the feel of Series 6 is so weird.

And yes and no. I think that in both cases the writers set up a really scary moment for the Doctor that they obviously had to get out of somehow without killing or seriously damaging the Doctor since they still had a show to make and messing too much with the Doctor's mortality (much like making River a *truly* evil bitch) would freak the fans out too much. So, in both cases, the resolutions feel a little disappointing. I do understand this. I just really love DW and try to forgive all of its sins instantly.",0,1318300435,null,0,true,0,c2qgwow,t3_l7my1,t1_c2qgwow,t1_c2qg1ep,1427714127,1,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,1

My problem with Moffat is the lack of character. I know you're more plot like Moffat's writing, and I like his plots too. They're great. But sometimes the characters don't really seem like characters, but people to fulfill the plot. Like River in the finale, it felt like she became more 2D in that story than I've ever seen her. With her undying fanfiction obsession. Of course the Silence /Forest fixes all that. Wait, haven't we discussed this before? /

I think that making River too psycho and killing the Doctor didn't have much to do with the fans. In fact, I don't think River was supposed to stay villain long, and obviously you can't kill the protagonist (for good).

As for the Silence, I don't believe they're aliens. The Teselecta said they were an organization, *not* a species. And as for Kovarian's relationship with the Silence &amp; Silents, we still didn't get much, even in the real universe. Why did she join up? What's her job? Is she the top-top boss? Characterization please! Either way, it's closed *enough* to be considered done...but given a choice I'd like more background. Same with the exploding TARDIS.

When I said ""trained"" I meant the time she spent at the Academy with the Silence/Silents (unknown which). Mentioned in LKH.

I think the Silence trained River to kill the Doctor, but it failed because she turned ""good"" in LKH. So then they had to get the astronaut suit out and force her. So they had a change in plans. Now speculation: River could've been plan B, and plan A could've been the Pandorica (manipulating the other alien races).

Oh I definitely forgive DW. For everything. Even the Technicolor Dreamcoat. I don't think there's anything that would make the show unwatchable.

However, it's just a feeling. Really seemed like the sinister air of menace she gave off in Series 5 just vanished. Maybe it was the quickfire execution of everything in LKH and TWoRS that threw me. 

As I said, I guess I don't need much more than Kovarian is a higher-up figure in the organization known as the Silence and is obviously a subordinate to the creatures we know as Silents. So that, to me, makes the whole Silence organization pretty much a side issue as it apparently just a puppet organization for the race known as the Silents.

As to not double post the best I can figure with regards to the ""Hooligans"" situation is this:

They got approval from the city to open more than a year ago and did, they got inspected and everything was fine then (this is for sure true). 

Then, come this past july inspectors made surprise visits to a bunch of businesses in the area and shut a bunch down. From what it seemed they wanted the places they shut down to hire ""independent"" inspectors to ... help them pass inspection.

They then claimed that the building they'd approved 12 months ago was no longer fit to be pub and needed over 10K dollars in renovations.

City counsel members agreed to meet with the owners and then kept postponing. Members of Crew supports groups showed up at rallys to ""save the bar"", which local news covered

They've organized a lot of ""save hooligans"" events that have been covered by the media and supposidly the city is willing to meet them half way, which is unfortunately still beyond what they can do,
 
however they think they can do it if they get a few land surveyors, mechanical/structural engineers to volunteer.

true,[deleted],null,null,"Well, both Runsible and Borusa seemed to think that Goth was the obvious choice. To quote his exact phrasing, in fact Goth's dying words, ""wanted power. The president told me I was not his successor."" Then he kind of croaks and rolls over dead. Now, prior to this, an *emergency* election *is* called since, and the reason is specifically mentioned by Borusa, no successor was named. Goth and the Doctor are the only candidates mentioned and Goth is by far favored to win (I'm sure in no small part because the Doctor was a renegade and former exile and Goth was head of the Prydonian Chapter). Hence, if there was to be an election anyway, and assuming Goth had nothing in particular to hide before teaming up with the Master *after* finding out he wasn't being named successor, then why bother? If it was a temporary situation he could have waited out without risking literally everything, why do it? I mean hopefully if you live for centuries, even if you're power-crazed you can wait a bit and then take power legitimately if you're as popular as Goth certainly seemed to be. Or at least wait until you know you've lost the legit election before you team up with a rotting hate-filled renegade who looks like Skeletor. The only way it makes sense for a respected and popular leader like Goth to risk everything the way he did is if he felt he had no other option. Yes, I'm sure the Master did exert some influence over him, but to the degree where he would participate in a scenario that is so unnecessary on its face if all he had to do was wait for an election cycle is pretty absurd, imo.

Now I'm starting to get the sinking feeling that I'm missing the part where the President had dirt on Goth, but presumably whoever (and we are never told) was going to be named successor would have already had said dirt too. And since AFAICR only the President, Runsible, Runsible's camera man and a guard or two (and Goth) are killed in the whole story, I *think* I'm on solid ground here.",0,1318305975,null,0,true,0,c2qhqly,t3_l7my1,t1_c2qhqly,t1_c2qhjc5,1427714519,1,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,1

Protecting yourself is always important with vaginal or anal because the risk becomes more significant. But there has to be a line we draw in regards to risk - otherwise we simply would never have sex, which isn't really going to happen.

Referring back to gonorrhoea thing, I would be worried if it became untreatable because it's an infection that poses a relatively high risk of transmission compared to the other STDs.

true,[deleted],null,null,"Besides the obvious implications of blocking a large part of the internet for the entire population there are many, many things wrong with this policy:

1. It is extremely rare for one to *stumble* upon adult content on the internet. If children are looking at adult content, they are probably *looking for adult content*. (As much as the charity in question would refuse to believe).

2. Children already know how to use proxy sites to bypass blocks on social networks. This will render the entire policy completely useless for those intentionally seeking out this kind of content.

3. Some ISPs already offer an opt-in service to block adult content. Alternatively, you can use parental control software to block whatever type of content you wish. Failing that, you could actually be a *parent* and *parent your child*, educate them, or even disallow them unsupervised internet access if you must. The promotion of these existing options would be much easier, cheaper, and far less authoritarian.

4. Who will maintain the list of blocked sites? As regular users of the internet on mobile phones may know, the blocking solutions employed by phone providers, for example, often block perfectly acceptable content. This is not a black &amp; white issue: anyone who has used the internet for more than a few minutes can tell you there are not clearly-defined ""porn sites"" and then clearly-defined ""100% family friendly sites"". So who decides which is which, and how? 

5. David Cameron has previously said he would like to create a British Silicon Valley. Leaving tech startups at the mercy of a government department which decides which sites are banned and which are not (and will, almost certainly, frequently get it wrong) is not a good way to promote this. I've run perfectly innocent websites that have been incorrectly categorised as ""adult"" by existing blocking solutions that workplaces and schools use. Losing visitors from schools and workplaces can be bad enough... but the thought of an entire country of 60 million people being unable to access your website because of a single government employee (or automated system) deciding your website isn't ""family-friendly"" enough is *terrifying*.

This policy is not going to save any children's lives or prevent children from being sexually abused. It is not going to stop parents dressing their children in revealing clothing or buying their children makeup. It is not going to stop anything believed to be morally abhorrent by the government or the involved charities.

One account i read was of a photog shooting a outdoor event on public grounds in the UK, he was hauled in the back of a police car while the copper gave him a lecture on taking photos of people in public and went through each photo on the camera criticizing it for being ""lewd"" or some other crap, and the guy wanting to get back out and shoot the event in progress felt so intimidated he wiped a few hundred photos just to shut the copper up, he said he just swapped out the memory card and recovered the pictures later.

I agree with you that it makes sense to be cremated, it's cheaper and we're running out of room for burying people. Graves and headstones etc provide comfort to families left behind but it probably makes sense for people to continue away from that.

You write as though if two cancer patients exist the NHS can treat one or the other. It isn't like that. Treatments are limited, of course, because of financial limits. However, it's more the case that if one cancer patient is going to cost the Earth to treat and will probably die anyway because the treatment is not that good, they may choose to use that money to treat 100 or 1000 other people in 'smaller' ways but ultimately improving their quality of life.

I don't think being a single person vs a father of two makes you less valuable as a human being or less deserving of life. If you're working, you are contributing to society, just in a different way. 

In any case I think it's a scary and dangerous idea to start saying that people should be seen as less valuable and less worthy of life and treatment based on things like their marital status and if they have kids or not. Sure it's tragic if a parent dies but being single doesn't mean no one depends on your or would be hurt by your death and most of us are rather attached to being alive. It's not like orphans starve in this country, either, they would be looked after. I do like your idea of being more pragmatic and less selfish, sure, I just think it could be taken the wrong way.

Page 18 of [the report](https://www.education.gov.uk/publications/eOrderingDownload/Bailey%20Review.pdf), point 5:

&gt; To provide a consistent level of protection across all media, as a matter of urgency, the internet industry should ensure that customers must make an active choice over what sort of content they want to allow their children to access. To facilitate this, the internet industry must act decisively to develop and introduce effective parental controls, with Government regulation if voluntary action is not forthcoming within a reasonable timescale. In addition, those providing content which is age-restricted, whether by law or company policy, should seek robust means of age verification as well as making it easy for parents to block underage access.

i.e. you will be asked and you will have to decide one way or the other.  Obviously it depends on the exact implementation, but as written it's closer to opt out.

Later, in cited evidence:

&gt; The internet and on-demand TV is my main concern, with children watching in their bedrooms. What is needed is a default setting for pornography, so that parents cannot leave it accessible by mistake.

Later still:

&gt; But we are also aware that Professor Byron recommended that the Government should consider a requirement for content filters on new home computers to be switched on by default if other approaches were failing to have an impact on the number and frequency of children coming across harmful or inappropriate content.

Confirming the active choice in the detailed section:

&gt; when a new device or service is purchased or contract entered into, customers would be asked to make an active choice about whether filters should be switched off or on

Not too sure where you are going with this point. Do actual believe that a child (of any age) has no use for a computer?

&gt;The children only use the computer when mummy or daddy can supervise

Parents can't and shouldn't supervise their children all the time. Filter software provides a parent with a way of controlling what their child has access to without having to actually monitor everything the child does, conversations with friends for example.

&gt;Use existing blocking software, such as net nanny

This is a fair point. I can only assume that the report concluded that if an ISP actively offered software to customers at sign up then people will be more likely to install it. Not everyone is that tech savy to even know that such things exist.

&gt;When the children start getting curious, switch to an ISP that offers content blocking

&gt;Competition authorities mandate that content blocking must be an option. ie if an ISP is the sole ISP for a town it must offer content blocking, but new entrants to the ISP market in a town where content blocking is available are not required to offer it

I'm assuming these points are more about the effect on ISP's rather than their customers. I admit I haven't given that any thought, but I'm not in charge of an ISP so...

&gt;Mandate opt-in blocking must be available from all ISP's
A less sensationalist article in the guardian suggests that, existing customers of ISP's will continue with their unfiltered access. It's only when you sign up to a new ISP will you have the *choice* of blocking content or not.

It's not pleasant, and it's only one small part of an extensive, pervasive and progressively debilitating disease which affects many of the body's most vital systems and often ultimately results in or at least hastens one of the common end-of-life terminal processes (heart disease, cerebro-vascular disease etc.).  Once the balance is messed up, everything starts going wrong and each element of the disease process feedbacks to every other.  Nasty stuff, especially since you can be type 2 diabetic for years or even decades with it screwing up your body over that time period without even realising you're sick.",0,1318335882,null,0,false,0,c2qk1ko,t3_l85qa,t1_c2qk1ko,t1_c2qjrss,1427715604,6,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,6

Without context it's really not a useful article. Particularly when the likes of this is thrown in:

They’re good girls and boys, appropriately attracted to the opposite sex, waiting to marry before they can get any of that nasty, sticky behaviour over with.

Democracy has limits, especially when it comes to protecting minorities - and in the UK we have a balance of power between the legislature, the executive AND the non-democratic judiciary.

The separation of elected MPs and non-elected peers to revise laws is also a stabilising force against populism.

Often it is politicians that drive social change and pass unpopular but moral laws long before the electorate considers them acceptable - but in doing so, cause changes in society that then make the old position look untennable.

Homosexuality was legalised long before the electorate would have done so if they were given a chance. The same for anti-racisim laws.

It also works the other way as drink driving was banned while still considered to be an acceptable act, yet today to admit to it is to become a social pariah.

The newspapers are to blame for not checking facts and blindly publishing policy announcements in the middle of the night. I recommend reading Flat Earth News by Nick Davies for more insight on how this shoddy echo chamber journalism propagates falsity.

As an aside, if you read points 46-48 on page 38 of the Bailey Review you note they only talk about new customers making an ""active choice"". Point 47 in particular acknowledges both opt in and opt out arrangements but doesn't settle on one or the other.
