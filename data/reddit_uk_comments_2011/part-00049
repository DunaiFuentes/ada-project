true,ColonelPanic2409,welsh,Cardiff,"We need more grammar schools. It is absolutely right that academically promising students be sent to schools which cater to their needs, rather than being held back by a large class of mostly uninterested and in some cases intentionally disruptive children. Equally, students who are interested in more hands-on subjects should be given the opportunity to learn practical skills, through an apprenticeship or technical college for example. The care and teaching given to these students should be of the same standard as that which is given to the more traditionally academic students.

Today's children are treated as a homogenous quantity because the system refuses to accept that students can or should be categorised into groups of differing abilities and taught accordingly. A student who is good with numbers may get moved into a different class for Maths, but really we should be identifying the most promising students and sending them to schools which are equipped to get the best out of them in all subjects. Right now, the main determining factor in the education you are given is your postcode.

What I consider to be a larger problem - a problem which affects all students, no matter the quality of the school they attend, is the frequency of testing. There is always an exam just around the corner, such that students are taught to remember content to regurgitate in exams rather than to truly understand topics. Even when an understanding is conveyed, it is necessarily a brief and superficial one. If there were fewer exams, teachers would be free to cater their lessons to match the capabilities and interests of the students, perhaps exploring tangential subjects when they arise rather than having to reign the students in to what is specified in the syllabus. How can we expect our children to be engaged and interested in their education when they have no control over the direction of their learning? They are passengers on a ride whose track runs from examination to examination, when they should be taking a journey of discovery with unexpected twists and turns. Exams should be a way to assess learning, not to structure it.

Equally, just because grammar schools taught students well, doesn't mean that they were diverting education away from the students at secondary moderns. Just because two things are at ends of the same scale, does not mean that they cause each other to remain at those ends. You seem to assume that while grammar schools existed it would have been impossible for secondary moderns to be run properly, which I do not believe is true.

Would you be in favour of a system in which each area had school A for academic students and school B for students with skills in more hands-on subjects, but both schools were well-funded and run properly?

true,abw,cnty-uk,Surrey,"&gt; It's not about being ""thick"", it can be about academically-inclined.

I think that's what Razakel is saying.  There are two different metrics here: one is academic aptitude and the other is overall intelligence.

Some people are very intelligent, but not academically minded.  We should be offering these people plenty of opportunities to excel at what they are good at, and not try and turn them into academics by force-feeding them Latin, Shakespeare and Einstein.  

On the other hand, there are people who just aren't very intelligent, disciplined, or motivated.  We certainly shouldn't give up on those people (especially not when they're children), but to a large extent it doesn't matter how much education you throw at them because they'll never achieve much.

I personally believe that the second set is very small and that the vast majority of so-called ""thick"" people are under-educated rather than under-intelligent.  Unfortunately, the age of political correctness seems to have instilled this mentality that all children should be given the same *academic* education and go off to university to get a degree.  When in fact, we should be reserving the *academic* education for the more intellectually minded students, and more *practical* education to those who excel in other areas.

true,koltra,null,null,"Faraday was pretty uneducated, low class and hardly knew any maths to express his theories in. I mean, he was also one of the greatest scientists of all time, but I don't think his mistreatment is to do with a Victorian distaste for the technical. Babbage was a crank -- though a wonderful one: that rare kind of crank whose cranky ideas turn out to have been half a century ahead of everyone else's. Far from being neglected, he was initially funded by the British Government, IIRC because they wanted a better way to compile tables of logarithms -- eminently practical.

And if anything English mathematics in Victorian times was unusually and insufficiently pure really -- if you like maths for its own sake. It was all mechanics and hydrostatics and applied calculus. And I think more than any era of educated people before them, the Victorians were practical, mercantile and unafraid of letting the realms of knowledge and the material world mix. Partly I think the upper class then had their sons study Classics with a practical motivation: that it would fit them and prepare them for politics and power. And after all, a large proportion of people studying Humanities were really preparing for careers as a clergymen. Lewis Carroll's [introduction to his book on *Symbolic Logic*](http://www.archive.org/stream/symboliclogicpa00carrgoog#page/n18/mode/2up) has a whole bit about how the advantage of playing at symbolic logic rather than chess is that the former gives you a clearness of thought and familiarity with fallacies that will help you in the world. Learn it because it's *useful*, not just because it's interesting in its own pure way.

In my humble opinion the problem today (that I think was less marked in the Victorian era) is mostly one of plain stupidity and short-sightedness in the matter of education and knowledge. Everyone knows that science and technology and art are how we move forward and make more money than other countries -- we don't have cheap labour or an abundance of resources to offer -- only our minds. And yet MPs don't seem to see that you need people thinking airy thoughts about what atoms are composed of -- and then the money to try and find out -- to do the science so they can create the technology that will make the UK rich. Or that you need to let young people (even when poor) laze about in art school to end up with Pink Floyd and the Beatles, and thus the British record industry. The Victorians -- with their Great Exhibition, Working Men's College, Proms, LSE and all that -- saw these things better than us.

Also, the UK isn't dominated by ""ignorant chavs"": they're mostly part of a powerless underclass. Think about the paucity of opportunities for learning (and the abundance of distractions), and the lack of opportunities for using learning (rather than using, say, ability to stack things on shelves). It's the MPs who act like the best thing to do is exploit an uneducated low class for relatively cheap labour, whilst only funding things that will make money right now, despite themselves having gone from private boarding schools with the best teachers to learned tutors at Oxford, who are the disgrace. *They're* the ones who could deal with these problems if they wanted to more than they want power and money.",0,1314437837,null,0,true,0,c2fk74g,t3_jvvbk,t1_c2fk74g,t1_c2fjw93,1427525319,12,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,12

true,Shaper_pmp,null,null,"&gt; I think it is a cop out to blame the curriculum.

The curriculum defines the course.  Teach them Word and Excel and sit them down to an exam or coursework on the minutiae of Word formatting, and they'll pass.

Teach your students to be genius computer programmers and to be able to build computers from scratch, and then sit them down to coursework and an exam on the minutiae of Word formatting and they'll likely fail, you'll get a bad performance evaluation, the school's ranking will drop and their funding will be cut.

Smart, interested kids can teach themselves programming and advanced OS use and spreadsheets and database theory *and* Word formatting, but for the dumb, uninterested or apathetic students you only have so much time in the classroom... and if you *don't* spend that teaching the curriculum you're basically wasting their time, harming your own career and making the school look bad.

It *shouldn't* be that way - the curriculum *should* prioritise theory over practice, and should teach a broad, general understanding of computing that makes picking up simple vocational skills like spreadsheets or word-processor usage trivial.

However, given the students are tested and marked on the curriculum, and the teachers and schools are rated on the students' abilities regarding the curriculum, saying ""it's a cop-out to blame the curriculum"" is just silly.

You're basically either advocating teachers pack three times as much into each lesson as they're capable of doing, or that they should ignore the national curriculum and go rogue, teaching whatever they think is right... which is kind of the *exact opposite* of the idea of a national curriculum.

Edit: It's true that a lot of teachers don't themselves understand the more advanced aspects of IT and computing, but regardless of that it's pointless to put people in a situation where they're rated on something specific and then expect them to ignore than and concentrate on other things.  Rail against the system all you like, but it's just daft to put people in a system *where their funding and professional rating is entirely dependent on a set of KPIs* and expect them to prioritise anything other than those KPIs.

The maze shouldn't be set up that way, but given that it is it's daft to blame the mouse for running through it in search of cheese.",0,1314441019,null,0,true,0,c2fkbkm,t3_jvvbk,t1_c2fkbkm,t1_c2fk31q,1427525377,9,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,9

The option of what of these different subjects falls to the teacher and it is purely down to them how complicated they make the subject. Teachers will take the easy option because 

A. Their own knowledge is not good enough to teach something more complicated, remembering a lot of teachers are legacy teachers who have hung onto their jobs and got them when the subject was not all that respected and self-taught them some basic stuff. 

B. As grants are generally based on performance of students at A-level even if they would like to teach the more complicated stuff they are pressured into doing the easier stuff to inflate their pass rates.

Regarding its wanting of the Doctor, after River killed the last of the crew on said Silence TARDIS the ship presumably took a scan of River and found her Timelord/Human DNA therefore when the ship landed it figured that humans could fly the ship based on their proximity to Rivers DNA and as such when the Doctor entered the TARDIS based on his DNA's proximity to River's it made the inference that the doctor could be the pilot.

The Doctor now KNOWS that she's a selfless woman, kind, caring, and willing to give her life to save so many others--he was able to view the finished person, so to speak, and saw her give her life. I don't think he would view her as quite the same person if he hadn't seen that first, would he? 

[It was already said that Melody Pond was stolen to become a weapon, against him, and normally someone like that--no matter who they were born to, is going to become your enemy unless there's some drastic changes. But when he finds out that Melody is River, remember him straightening his bowtie and spinning on the spot in gleeful anticipation of meeting little River/Melody! Do you think, if he hadn't known her previously, as River, he would have done that? Definitely not.](/spoiler)

The sequence of events is tragic--seeing her go backwards in time like that, but necessary for things to pan out like they are. That was another line as well: ""When he first met me, he knew everything about me, do you have any idea what that does to a girl?"" Obviously he already knew River and that is part of what made her fall in love with him.

The Line, of course, is also especially sad because it does foreshadow her future, but his past--that because he didn't want to trust her, the people of the expedition died in the library, including her. Luckily, of course, he did find a way around it at the last moment--she will technically now be close to immortal(this place runs on fusion cells, they'll outburn the sun), which is some consolation.

Also, for anyone who might complain about why it was 10's screwdriver and not 11's: He already knew River would be meeting 10 at the end of her life, so making it look like his screwdriver keeps 10 from tossing it or assuming that it's someone else's sonic screwdriver. He trusts that it's his, and thus keeps it with him, along with the diary, until the end. Making it look like 11's screwdriver would just mean it's another screwdriver to 10, because it hasn't happened yet. He would know that he needed the screwdriver to be familiar to him, at that time.

Depending on your budget, there's plenty of places to stay. From budget places like premier inns all the way up to the Hilton or Malmaison down at the docks. If you're a Beatles fan there's the Hard Day's Night hotel. 

I'd definitely recommend going on a city tour too. I think the open top busses are okay, but the best bet is the Yellow Duckmarine tour.

The pubs to go around the ground would be the Albert (right behind the Kop) which has a belter of an atmosphere before a game. The Sandon which is just down the road from Anfield is a good pub and is traditionally where the players used to drink following a game (although that'd never happen these days). If you're going into town there's literally hundreds of pubs and bars. Carragher has a sports bar in town (Sports England I think it's called). Best bet though is probably down Matthew Street or Bold Street/Concert Square. There are also some pretty exclusive bars and restaurants down at the Albert Dock.

Getting the tickets I recon the fan club is your best bet. TicketExchange or OntheKop sites are sometimes good, although you can usually only get then last minute and are a bit of a gamble.

According to the [Institute of Physics](http://www.iop.org/news/10/sep10/page_44834.html) there is a shortage of Physics teachers with only 1.6 per school on average in England at least and only 19% of science teachers having a degree in Physics despite equal weight across the sciences.

Also according to the [government data](http://www.tda.gov.uk/get-into-teaching/faqs/becoming-a-teacher/teachers-degrees.aspx) only 10% of recent science teachers' degrees were in Physics and so this trend is not in recovery.

Finally, if you are a PhD then you do not represent the average teacher's ability and should not draw conclusions from your ability to teach.

When presented with a real world programming language most wouldn't know where to start.

Tech Studies covered electrical theory, mechanics and some low level cpu stuff but once again very little opportunity to actually put the concepts learned into practice.

What we really need is a course that teaches kids programming.  No more dicking around teaching basic concepts using useless languages, just jump straight into something they can actually put to use in the real world.  It's not going to be for everyone but if its specifically called 'Programming' or similar it should be clear to anyone considering it what its content would be.

Because ICT is. I think you'll be able to get some idea of the syllabus from [these pages](http://www.bbc.co.uk/schools/gcsebitesize/ict/).

My sample size is probably biased. If a kid is able to study ""advanced"" computer classes in school, he or she can probably fix their parents' computer. However, none of my customers' kids have done anything in school beyond the kind of ICT class described, which is based on the use of Word &amp; Powerpoint.

I left school in around 1989, and my schools were lucky to have a classroom full of BBC Micros &amp;/or early PCs. However I went to uni as a mature student in autumn 1999, to study computer science; there was a class of c 100 of us (at one of the 5 best unis in the country for comp sci) and only a handful had done any programming before or taken computer programming classes at school. Certainly less than 15%, probably less than 10%.

I think there is a ""computer science"" (i.e. programming) GCSE &amp;/or A-level, but I don't think many places teach it. A student passing a GCSE in using Word looks just as good on the school's statistics as a student passing a proper computing course - it looks *better* on the statistics and league tables of schools to pass a student in the easy course than it is to have a student fail (or get a lower grade) in the harder course.

Maybe I'm out of touch, but I have been pretty shocked when my customers kids haven't known what binary is. I ask them if they did any non-base-10 maths, and explained it to them. They looked at me blankly, and even after I explained it in detail, no, they hadn't studied that.

Also, every town in Somerset thinks another is really inbred (in Yeovil it is Martock that is said to be inbred, in Martock it is Langport), and every county in England thinks Somerset is inbred.

true,BraveSirRobin,null,null,"&gt; at least then Computing still involved some programming theory although it was largely taught using useless, defunct languages like COMAL and didn't really teach anything beyond the very basic concepts.

What do you expect though from one single class that also covers a lot of other computing stuff? Granted most of what I did is dead now e.g. token-ring networks. ;-)

In some ways it's good to get in at this level, think of the varying level languages:

- assembly
- basic
- high-level

Assembly is too much to get the concepts across and it has limited real-world use today. High-level languages have a heap of baggage that must also be taught e.g. compilers, OO. Starting with COMAL/BASIC is a good intro to things like loops, conditionals &amp; simple variable usage. 

Given your age I'd expect that you (like me) learned programming at home using these defunct languages. Was it really all that bad a way to do it?

&gt; Tech Studies...some low level cpu stuff but once again very little opportunity to actually put the concepts learned into practice

We got to write 6502 assembly code to control a negative feedback loop from a optical speed sensor controlling a motor so that the speed of an electric car was constant even going up a slope. Pretty real-world imho, a complete end-to-end project.

The outfit reflects on the particular Doctor's personality, Tom Baker with the scarf and big floppy hat, a mad traveller. Christopher Eccleston, a leather jacket and shirt, more of the badboy (from being born in the time war). David Tennant, the long coat and pinstripe suit with the converse and spiked up hair, showing, again, a mad traveller off to see the world, but can be serious when the time comes. Matt's look, the bowtie, braces and tweed, making him out to be a nerdy/geeky sort of man that doesn't need to rely on looks for people to take him seriously. Each regeneration's personality is formed by the sort of circumstances they're ""born"" into. The 9th was born in battle, a hot-tempered sort of person. 10, born in a difficult situation requiring quick thinking, mercy but ""no second chances."" 11, crashed in a little girls backgarden and needing food to complete the regeneration sequence, making him friendly, wise and a little weirdly funny to make the girl feel comfortable yet can read into the situation and notice things, the crack in the wall bothering her more than an alien crashing in her backyard, the duck pond everything.

I'm going to put my money straight down and guess that it is [Doctor, Who? which River/Melody now knows the answer to.](/spoiler)

It just felt like a very jumbled episode with a lot of exposition that didn't really fit in with all the action going on in side the [T1000](/spoiler). I do hope it makes a reappearance as it's a really great idea which could do with fleshing out, despite now having been more or less done and defeated in this episode.

All in all the whole episode seemed to sacrifice making an interesting and exciting story (utilising either the ""nightmare-inducing monster"" or ""cheesy but cool one-liner with side order of Scottish sass"" tactics) to pile on more plot threads and references to previous episodes. After going months without any fresh Who, I know which I'd have preferred, despite having spent most of the last month in bed watching past episodes, venturing out only to buy a sonic screwdriver.

At least next week it looks like we're back to the regular Moffat mindfuckery!

Thank you so much for offering advice about online courses. Part of the reason I've not yet started is because I don't know which one is best. I'm also a little concerned about the Northern/Southern variants: which one do people generally find more useful? Cardiff being in the South and being the biggest city, I suppose more people speak the Southern variant... is my assumption wrong?

It's been years since I last looked at free Welsh courses online. [This](http://www.cs.cf.ac.uk/fun/welsh/home.html) seems to be the one I first found many years ago. Since then, it appears that the BBC (of all organisations!), has created [an extensive beginners' website](http://www.bbc.co.uk/wales/learning/learnwelsh/). There's also [this one](http://www.saysomethinginwelsh.com/home/), but it involves podcasts, which I would not be able to follow without transcripts because I am hearing impaired.

Again, thank you! I'm very glad to have found this lovely subreddit.

Edit: Also, the Welsh government has [a list of free resources](http://www.welshforadults.org/resources/freecourses/?lang=en).

Shoehorning in this Mels character shows that Moffat didn't plan the character's biography in any detail. In my opinion, if you're going to make a character like River with such a convoluted timeline and mysterious past, and then you're going to make her the daughter of your other protagonists, you should really know know and map out **every detail** of that character's life *before* you start filming any episodes with her. This shows that Moffat had a vague idea, and I think having a vague idea just falls apart because of plotholes and stuff.

Moffat didn't plan River's life before this season, otherwise he would've at least alluded to Mels before now in a way that made the audience **not** suspicious when she shows up in a *very* River Song fashion. We learned in episode 1 of last season that Amy was obsessed with the Raggedy Doctor as a child and made Rory dress up as him and stuff, but made no mention of ""Mels."" Plus the flashbacks show Amy as not all that obsessed with him, instead **MELS** is the one obsessed with Amy's imaginary friend. If the Doctor said he *did* remember her from the wedding, that's another reason not to be suspicious and thus be more shocked at her regeneration.

The internet isn't anything to do with them -- they don't have to provide good libraries (and they don't intend to anymore) -- it's just there, provided by the collective effort of lots of other willing people, and thank God for them. And so far as I can see it's being made harder to get into university, and harder to get educated with anything in mind other than a secure career, and harder to get a good school education, and they're *destroying* Open University. I think we have inherited a better situation than the Victorians did (they helped make it for us), but we aren't improving it at the rate they did. Nor do we seem to *want* to improve it so much.

I like looking at the past, because it's more solid and we can see what worked and what didn't and what's possible and how much improvement is possible. I don't want to leave the past to the conservatives. They look back and somehow forget that the people they're looking back were pretty often progressives.

I would say Einstein is an example of an educated scientist with above average maths -- solid, standard physics grounding at university, and the tensor mathematics he learned how to use for General Relativity seems reasonably advanced (by this I mean I find it too difficult!) and unusual for its time, notwithstanding his complaints about his difficulties with maths -- to compare to Faraday's lack of education and maths. But yes, it's the lack of education of someone whose self-educated, and it's perhaps unfair to call Faraday uneducated. Just, as it's not a normal university style education for the field he's working in I think it accounts for some of the disdain with which he was treated. It's what I think people meant when they dismissed him as overly practical and insufficiently theoretical.

However, I do stand by my criticisms; the fact that a large proportion of the health consequences of cannabis listed are in fact things that cannabis doesn't do is, well, just odd. As I say, it's great these myths are debunked though.

Some other comments are just stating the bleeding obvious, such as ""frequent, heavy users are at the greatest risk of dependence"". Of course, had the document said ""moderate use presents little risk of dependency"" it might not have gone down so well with government.

The document does highlight the dangers of prohibited drugs in terms of uncertain strengths and purities, but of course doesn't point out that these extra dangers - above and beyond the dangers drug use can cause - are the result of the policy this document is designed to support. I think it's important to draw attention to that fact.

Regards ""Permacuture's"" claim to have once been one of the people who ran UKCIA, I do find that interesting since I have been doing it more or less single handedly since 1998, three years after it first went online.

* An unknown number of regenerations may or may not take place.

* Melody is stuck in an astronaut suit c. 1969 AD appears to be about 5 to 7 years old in this regeneration. She appears to have escaped the Silence, because she's worried they will ""get her."" She gets shot by Amy, who is trying to Save the Doctor's life. Somehow she gets out of the Astronaut suit, requiring a lot of energy. 6 months after the moon landing, in an alley in New York she regenerates into Mels.

* Somehow she gets from New York to the UK and raised in Leadworth, growing up with Amy and Rory.

* Then she becomes River Pond and has all the adventures we've seen/heard of, including but not limited to Let's Kill Hitler, Crash of the Byzantium, The Pandorica Opens, Silence in America, Picnic at Asgard, The Bone Meadows, Easter Island, Jim the Fish, Ice Skating on the Thames in 1814 with Stevie Wonder, the aftermath of the Battle of Demons Run, and The Library.

Moffat cut the planet out for budget and time and told him to change the Corsair so that he's not a proto-doctor. So he threw in that line about having been a girl to make the character interesting.

&gt; • The long-standing fan argument (and joke) about whether timelords can change gender on regeneration seems to be now definitively settled. Was there any disagreement or debate about that? Does it foreshadowing the appearance of a female timelord? Who would you ideal female timelord be? @duncangeorge @hastydave

The odd bit here is that for me it had been definitively settled when Doctor Eleven tried to figure out whether or not he was a girl.

But it seemed to make sense, and it made the Time Lords more interesting for me, not less, and I put it in the script, always as a throwaway.

The description of the Corsair and the Doctor's relationship with him got shorter and shorter in script after script, but that aside remained, and I'm glad it did, if only because the next time the BBC needs to cast a Doctor, the press and fans get to argue passionately about twice as many actors.

Whose woods these are I think I know.

His house is in the village, though;

He will not see me stopping here

To watch his woods fill up with snow.

My little horse must think it queer

To stop without a farmhouse near

Between the woods and frozen lake

The darkest evening of the year.

He gives his harness bells a shake

To ask if there is some mistake.

The only other sound's the sweep

Of easy wind and downy flake.

The woods are lovely, dark, and deep,

But I have promises to keep,

And miles to go before I sleep,

**And miles to go before I sleep.**

 Sometimes friend, sometimes foe, always interesting, with tons of new adventures. The doctor could have won her over slowly, through their adventures and combats, always a vague sort of sexual tension, since one of them knows what's coming, a team up here and there (all of this terribly out of order of course). And then, one day, she ends up at Lake Silencio, in Utah, perhaps her first time as Kingston, and shoots the Doctor dead. And that marks the true turning point for her character, who goes back to save the doctor in a similar manner, since she has grown to love him too much.

It was a message told to Melody Pond to pass to River Song, and it could just as easily been 'I trust you to do the right thing.'.

Most of her major development takes place over a few key episodes, bouncing from mysterious woman who knows the Doctor's name to a stolen baby to a redeemed assassin. I'm sad to think that she'll probably be gone and replaced with a new companion in the next season or so with no mention of her again.

I was hoping that we'd see more of a young River. River as the girl the doctor knows everything about as he sweeps off her feet and they run off to go adventuring, a real Doctor/Companion romance. 

Moffat could have even thrown in a regeneration or two along the way, wouldn't that be something? A long term companion being the one to regenerate and change at the end of the season's run rather than the Doctor? 

With all the importance building up on her since her appearance 3 years ago I just feel like it's being rushed out now and it's kind of a let down.

Are you displaying any physical symptoms as a result of your condition/treatment. It is possible that a doctor could spot things you were not aware of- especially if he has met with you on different occasions throughout your illness/treatment. 

Why did he raise this with you? Was he offering advice? 

Having worked in the NHS for many years (until last year) it is true that there are many, many people who have access to your records within one hospital, be they paper or digital. If he has no professional reason to be looking at your records then he is in the wrong. In any case, bringing it up with you is very odd. Hospitals I have worked in have a tracking system for tracking who has accessed a patient's paper notes and the reason (quite basic but eg. Dr's secretary to arrange an appointment). It would however be very difficult for you to access this information. 

I would suggest that if you do not feel this person is trying to help and has no professional reason for accessing your records then you should just ask him directly. I think it's the only way you can get to the bottom of this one and as I said it would be quite difficult to prove anything.

Why have ""cameos"" by former companions if they're just there to titillate fans of previous companions, without any real reason for them to be there?

Why have a complete lack of plot in favor of using the entire hour to sort-of expound on loose ends from the first half of the season?

River's name is circular. She grew up knowing she was Melody, but her name changes because Amy, Rory, and the Doctor call her River. It is her new identity putting the lunatic, psychopath, brainwashed Melody behind her. Amy only knew the name ""River Song"" from the prayer leaf from the girl from the Gamma Forest. The girl only innocently translated the name from one language to another. River points it out to her so Amy can name her when she sees her regenerate.

*Time of Angels/Flesh and Stone:*

- The clerics said that “She killed a man, killed a good man, a hero to many...who? you don’t want to know, you really don’t want to know”

- She herself admitted that the person she killed was  “A very good man, the best man I ever knew”

*Demons Run:*

- ""Demons Run When A Good Man Goes to War"". In this episode, we are led to believe that the Doctor is the good man going to war, yet at the beginning of the episode, it is Rory who we see fighting all of the enemies.


And as [cessandra](http://www.reddit.com/r/doctorwho/comments/jw9od/lets_kill_hitler_discussion_for_gmt_whovians/c2fot3l) said earlier:

&gt;They did not say that Melody/River killed the Doctor in Utah. They said she killed him, and they said he died in Utah. Considering that she did just kill the Doctor in 1938 - and then brought him back - both of these statements could be true without being related.
It's a possibility.

I used polo shirts as a default example of typical office/cubicle attire that isn't a long sleeve shirt, tie and coat. Substitute ""polo shirt"" with anything else in that genre - short sleeve button down, nice shirt with no buttons, etc.

I work at an anti-poverty nonprofit, in an office cube farm in NYC. Dress code is a very lax interpretation of ""business casual,"" though when I interviewed I dressed a bit nicer than average. I admit I was desperate when I got the job, and I'm grateful to have it, but I don't get the animosity.

I don't have to wear a tie or a jacket, hell I rarely wear shoes unless I have a meeting to attend. A button-down shirt counts as ""business casual,"" even if it's a Serius Black Azkaban Prison shirt.

true,Kiram,mcgann,McGann,"I think, especially with a slightly more sinister version of Melody running around in Mels, we had a fantastic opportunity to create the next Master. The Doctor needs someone, a near equal, to bounce off of and defeat. The Daleks are great, but the master truly challenges and hurts him. 

And River is probably the absolute best person for this, as well as providing that wonderful sense of ""Hopping around in time is sure to make certain meetings very interesting"" sort of vibe that River has provided all along. In one character she could have been villain, companion, plot device, force of nature and love interest. All rolled into one neat little timey wimey ball. 

This way is fine, from a perspective of wrapping up the character, I'm just slightly disappointed that they gave us a character with a HUGE list of possibilities, and then in the very next episode narrowed them down to pretty much one path.

 It's still possible to go down the a different route, I suppose, by inserting regenerations between Mels and River, but I think it would lose some of the effect, knowing what we know. Because we have seen her first and final (and I believe all, since she states that the last time she regenerated she was in new york, as a toddler, and I'm pretty sure all the dates will line up properly.

My bet is that the Silence has been shaping the course of their religion to make them obedient, in order to get revenge on the Doctor for turning everyone against them with the moon landing footage.

And yes, there is a science versus religion thing going on, but I think that it's more of a ""faith versus reason"" dilemma than anything else.

I recommend Rose or The Eleventh Hour, depending on how much of the series you want your friend to see. If you want to get him/her into Tennant, start with Rose to better the connection to the eponymous companion (Not that the Christmas Invasion isn't wonderful, it perfectly encapsulates the Tennant era, but is too bogged down with continuity for new viewers). To keep your friend on par with the current series, give him Matt's first run and keep her going from there.

My guess is that when they feel like they can't cut out any more, they ""time compress"" some scenes in order to shorten the running time.

There are two reasons I call it the arse end of Somerset;

a) It is slightly run down. Sorry. The fact remains, there isn't a huge amount of quality housing around the area, and whilst not high-rise, the 1930's-1950's houses dotted around Yeovil are considered to be of poor quality. There is a lot of them too. The shopping centre does leave quite a lot to be desired as well. A dis-proportionate amount of shops have been closed/boarded up since the recession compared to other towns, and doesn't offer a huge amount in the likes of restaurants, bars, pubs, or even high-end shopping.

You might find one or two Western Union branches here, they are fast, but expensive.

Get a referrral letter from your UK school addressed to the manager of the branch you want to apply for an account with. HSBC and Natwest might be worth a try. Be wary of Barclay's, they would give you an ""international wealth"" account with monthly charges.

While in mainland Europe, withdraw using US debit card to avoid double currency conversion. There will be plenty of places in UK selling you euro as cash, but usually not as competitive or safe as cards. You could bring a smaller amount oc euros for emergency, same for pounds when you come here.

Note that your debit card should be Visa orMasterCard/Maestro for withdrawals to work smoothly. 

I was in your situation in the UK for the first 6 months, but did not bother setting up a bank account, which I later regretted. I just used the VISA credit card from my home country for everything from groceries to eating out, and withdrew money from my debit card (as CC add %%% on withdrawal) for everything else, including paying rent cash and bills, which was a bit trickier without an account for direct debit.

Note that visa and mastercard charge about 2% excess by artificially lowering their exchange rate, but your US bank would typically charge you for foreign withdrawal as well.

The Doctor has discovered that there's an army fighting a war against him, his name has come to mean 'warrior' across the galaxy, rather than 'healer' or 'wise man', and, as River pointed out, he's able to raise an army just by asking.  He's become too well known and feared, he needs the universe to think he's dead.

He and River arrange to fake his death convincingly, and she allows herself to be sentenced to the Stormcage prison, in order to make it work,and get the Silence religious order to stop pursuing him and his loved ones.

As supporting evidence, I have a memory of seeing a Moffat interview where he talks about the Doctor being too well known across the universe.  Specifically, he said something to the effect that the Doctor shouldn't be able to stand up and intimidate villains just by reputation, as he did at Stonehenge in the Pandorica Opens.

Yeah, I too was annoyed about leaving Hitler in the closet.
It's about time Hitler came out of the closet. Wait.  That's not like it sounds...

So, the doctor is wearing a new, double-breasted coat. But when he was killed the first time he wasn't wearing it. Hmm. Does this mean he went back to old tailoring? Or...

How did Riversong get down to the street from that height when she appeared to merely jump? How exactly was she bullet-proof? Immediate disbelief here.

After Riversong appeared, how is it her previous self was carrying that specific poison?

How did she manage to show up exactly when the doctor appeared in the field?

How did Riversong get from the 1930s to the 51st century without timetravel. But if her mentors have time travel, the whole story unravels. How did the regenerated little girl  in a previous episode get from an alley in New York to Scotland  at such a young age and enroll in Amy's school? For xxxx to suddenly appear as a classmate when we'd never once been shown her before, and she was not at the wedding, seemed too much of an insertion.

Moffat knows how to do melodrama but I get annoyed when he drops things in out of nowhere and never explains them. Damages the story suspension of disbelief.

I found a couple of whopper holes in this episode and the story arc but am not going to spoil it for others. Will post once the season ends.

I don't think most writers know this process very well, but they often get at least parts of it right.

But what bothered me was Amy and Rory's emotional state (not sad/depressed) at the beginning of the episode, after they've had a fairly long time to get over the shock and anger of baby Melody being taken from them.

true,ewokjedi,null,null,"There's really no _technically_ about it. You're right that meaning follows usage, and to some degree it should or must. An immutable language is a dead language, I know. But there's also a place for using dictionaries in a prescriptive (rather than solely descriptive) sense. In this, like so many other dichotomies, we tread a not-so-fine line between the two to arrive at sensible results. 

So why call out this particular usage mistake? Well, because it remains IMO demonstrably wrong and because people use it this way out of ignorance or a desire to sound more eloquent (or both). And when they use it among people who know better, it sounds especially bad. Using that phrase incorrectly here is no big deal. Using it incorrectly in a job interview or business presentation is embarrassing. I seek to provide some measure of insurance against the latter. 

&gt; Though you're always welcome to try to convince people that the original meaning/usage is more beneficial, clear, fun, whatever.

That, it certainly isn't--at least not to modern speakers' ears. The ""correct"" usage is indeed far less intuitive than the ""incorrect"" usage. But we have a perfectly serviceable phrase in, ""raises the question."" 

In my line of work, words must be selected and arranged to form precise, unambiguous meanings--and so I tend to be overly sensitive to these issues and favor the use of dictionaries in a prescriptive sense.

Over the years there has been much debate as to the source of van Gogh's illness and its effect on his work. Over 150 psychiatrists have attempted to label its root, with some 30 different diagnoses.[138] Diagnoses include schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, syphilis, poisoning from swallowed paints, temporal lobe epilepsy and acute intermittent porphyria. Any of these could have been the culprit and been aggravated by malnutrition, overwork, insomnia and consumption of alcohol, especially absinthe. - from wikipedia

true,Silgrenus,cyberman,Cyberperson,"At first, I loved Moffat when he took over the show, I was a huge fan of Season 5. But the last episode of Season 5 was awful, in my opinion, and so was the Christmas Special. The first episode of Season 6 was sub-par, but after that it bounced up again, 'Day of the Moon' was great for me. Moffat has good stories and ideas, yeah. I admit, the Gas Mask Zombies terrify me, the Silence and Angels not so much, but I can see how they scare others. But I don't like how Moffat teases and leaves a bunch of enigmatic messages regarding Doctor Who, I think it's him as a person vs his writing style. 'A Good Man' was not a good episode, but the newest one wasn't bad. It had nothing to do with Hitler, but it gave us a lot of backstory into River. But that's also become a problem, the show has become a lot about Amy and River, as opposed to the Doctor himself. 

Personally, I prefer RTD's writing, but I can understand how some people like Moffat's. RTD did go over the top when it came to emotional endings and all, but what I like about his stories was that the arcs were shown, but surreptitiously, as opposed to Moffat's writing, that basically shoves it in our face that we don't know what's going on. So Moffat is trying too hard to be enigmatic and mysterious. His stories are actually fascinating, I am loving the idea of the Silence being an order as opposed to the species we encountered, but he tries too hard to raise suspense. And I also dislike how some people are just so slanderous to RTD, but seem to worship Moffat as some sort of writing god.

Witty dialogue, touching moments, etc. It shows at its best in Vincent and the Doctor, TIA/Day of the moon, Big Bang/Pandorica opens, the first half of AGMGTW.

Then there's all this extra crap that brings it all down. Gimmicks that large chunks if not entire episodes seem to focus on. The biggest example I can think of is by far the relationship between Amy and River. Here we have two perfectly interesting, fun characters in each their own right. Watching them interact in The Time of Angels &amp; Flesh and Stone was a lot of fun. We don't need some gimmick ""Moffuck"" to make things better, but that's what we got, and to those of us whose entertainment isn't satisfied by such unnecessary things were left lacking.

I like ""begs the question"" in the common sense usage (which you disapprove of) because it makes sense.  It's logical.  I think begs the question is far more accurate and logical than raises the question.  Raising a question sounds more neutral, while begging sounds like a strong link between the thing and the question about the thing, almost demanding an answer.  Know what I mean?  I still don't know what the alternate meaning is (I tried reading about it once, but it was either a really badly written description, or just a really incomprehensible meaning) but the way it's been used here seems quite appropriate given the meaning of the words, and will likely be the linguistic evolutionary survivor.  And if some interviewer is going to care if I follow some old rules about phrases, then I'm quite happy to stay well away from them when it comes to work, etc.  No sense in subjecting myself to overly rule-obsessed folks!

I mean, I'm a grammar police type myself, and I really love focusing on the original meanings of words (and rally for people to pay attention to them as well) but I'm certainly not going to care if someone has a different, reasonable, choice in word usage.

And then Series 6 started and now the show seems like it's Doctor Song instead of Doctor Who. It seems like she is the focus for every episode in the season and it shouldn't be like that. Even in Series 1, which had all the lead up to Rose being Bad Wolf, it was a minor thing. It appeared in the episodes, it kept you intrigued but they really only devoted the season finale to exploring that arc (forgive me if my memory is incorrect on this one).

His biggest weakness, to me, is that the parts of his stories that do not fit into the brilliant over-arching storyline are rather flat.

I love what Moffat has done for the last two years, but at the same time it really feels like the whole Rory/Amy/River story needs to finally come to an end here. It's been nice seeing it build up to what will hopefully be a satisfying end, and it's a great chapter in the Doctor's story, but as much as the Doctor is tied to the lives of his companions there comes a point where their stories stop being his story. Two seasons seems about the right amount of time for any companion, and since this set have told such a big story on their own I definitely think it's time for them to part with the Doc. That, and honestly I preferred it when every season had it's own personality, it made it more exciting because the show felt like it was always changing it's identity, like the Doctor himself. Season 7 needs a new companion and a new identity, one where the Doctor spends less time flirting and getting caught up in family drama.

She could have been raised by the Silence and brought into Amy's life because Amy would eventually meet the Doctor. 

The Silence could have somehow implanted the knowledge of Mels into both Amy and Rory (Amy was kidnapped, and I do not remember if it was explained what happened to Rory when he first met the Silence creatures).

She could have escaped/been let go to find her way to her mother.

&gt; I guess my overall question is did she know Amy was her mother and did she intentionally befriend her?

I believe at one point, she mentioned that it took her awhile to find Amy and Rory. Also, she called Rory ""Dad"" so, yes, she knew who they were.",0,1314566332,null,0,false,0,c2fv4j1,t3_jxa4c,t1_c2fv4j1,t3_jxa4c,1427530596,2,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,2

On top of that, the doctor is nice, but it does get old seeing him being the great white wonder season after season. My favorite episode during Tennant's run was Donna saving the day as part timelord. Midnight is my other favorite--it shows how instrumental having someone to negotiate and humanize the doctor is to him -not- dying via some group of angry people.

River, I think, is a good equal for the doctor. She's intelligent, good with a gun, and not afraid to kill things. She's not overly tragic because that fits with the ""The Doctor is a magnet for destruction and chaos."" meme that we've seen over and over again. He effects people, and this is no different than any other person the doctor has been around--Like the girl from Gamma Forest becoming a cleric just to meet him again.

Also, if you don't like her--she won't be around forever. It's the same with companions. You don't like her, skip a season, skip two seasons, just don't watch the episodes with her in it. Plenty of people hate Donna or Martha or really hate Rose--That is always the good news about Doctor Who, it goes on, it continues, you will get a new companion in another season, you'll even get a new Doctor in a few seasons if you're not a fan of this one.

Example: I'm not a fan of Rose, never really was--but I liked Jack, I liked plenty of others. And it's not like the adventures with Rose were subpar.

I do think the writing is better now. I -like- these story arcs, a well as the implantation of bits of the story earlier on, rather than dumping it all on us at the end of a season. The episode-contained story arcs are called the ""Monster of the Week"" format--which many shows have, from House to Stargate SG-1, and most shows will oscillate between the Monster of the Week format and longer Story-Arcs that are like extended movies. Right now you get a few Monster of the Week episodes, then the longer Story-Arc groupings--which I think is a good mix. Too much Monster of the Week and you have trouble showing character development, and too much large arcs and you risk people forgetting what happened the past 7 weeks of shows(1 show per week, etc).",0,1314567265,null,0,false,0,c2fv8g1,t3_jx2lj,t1_c2fv8g1,t1_c2fuqce,1427530648,7,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,7

true,[deleted],null,null,"I believe ""River"" is at least the 5th. Running down what is semi-confirmed or assumed so far about her incarnations:

1) Melody Pond the infant in AGMGTW. 

2) Next confirmed incarnation is the child in New York (Day of the Moon). As Mels is regenerating, she says ""Last time I did this I ended up a toddler. In New York."" So, the child was not the same as ""Melody"" and at least the second incarnation. My take is when she says ""Last time I did this..."" she is talking about exerting that much control over the regeneration. 

3) Unknown product of regeneration in DotM - this one can easily go a couple different ways and may be multiple here. 

4) Mels

5) River

As you've stated, it's unlikely that Mels is the regeneration in DotM and she probably went through at least one more regeneration between 1969 and ~1993. Unless she has time travel, then anything is possible. 

Another possibility is Mels was the regeneration in Day of the Moon and went from a child to a toddler. This makes the assumption that she has massive control over her aging, as she couldn't have aged at all from 1969 to about 1993, then started aging normally with Amy. Possible given River's ""I may age backwards. Just a little"" speech.

&gt; we've gotten 3 points from less-than-great performances two weeks running and grinding out those wins is absolutely necessary in a successful campaign

A win is a win. At least we didn't tie or lose to West Brom and Norwich. Successful campaigns are built on wins, regardless of how pretty they are.

Chavva said:
&gt; Bosingwa v Young looks scary for us. He'll need to defend a lot better than usual if we want to win

Pretty much. If we're going up against Liverpool, City, or United our defense needs to not drop the ball. No Alex getting bullied away by Shane Long incidents - those teams have really good forwards and strikers that will punish us if we fuck up (that sort of goes without saying).

Yep, this guy or anyone else really needs to be that talisman that can put up 20 or so goals this season.

I think we'll see that with our young guys. Lukaku looked great on Saturday and Mata scored. Cohesion time aside I think we'll get there too.

**tl;dr: It's week three, just because United manages to put 8 past a League One quality Arsenal and City manages to net five on an apparently sleeping Spurs doesn't mean our team is in trouble.

I was really looking forward to yesterday's episode.  When I watched it, it was a huge letdown for me.  I never realized it before, but LKH was the episode when it dawned on me that I hate River.  Imagine you had a friend who had never seen Who.  If LKH was the only episode they'd ever seen, they'd likely never watch it again.  It was so convoluted and confusing, and....just annoying.  The Doctor is dying...again.  River is prancing around being irritating.  The time cop people don't even follow their own logic.  The whole thing was a mess.  
Then I come to r/DoctorWho to the episode discussion, and people are praising it as the finest Who episode of all time.  I just didn't see it.  I was incredibly bored, and had to force myself to keep watching.  
I'm glad I'm not alone.  I don't mind the arcs, in fact I like them, but this particular arc is getting tired.  
It's almost happening to Torchwood as well.  I was watching Miracle Day week after week, when I found myself losing interest.  I still haven't watched the latest episode, because I assume they still aren't going to get to the point yet.

true,Silgrenus,cyberman,Cyberperson,"OK, starting with 'The Big Bang'. To start it off, the way that the Doctor escapes should not happen. So that paradox that sets off the whole episode puts me off it from the start. Secondly, the idea of Earth and an exploding TARDIS being the only things left in the Universe after it was erased it ridiculous, especially when you consider that all the bad guys are turned into afterimages, but the whole of humanity doesn't. Thirdly, after such a huge buildup in 'The Pandorica Opens', to have it all blatantly removed, save for a Dalek is just dissappointing. The episode had some saving graces, mainly in the superb acting and the astounding character and emotional developing. But it still wasn't enough.

The Christmas Special was a complete disaster, it made absolutely no sense. The opera singing was clearly only written in because of the singer, whilst the idea of 'Time being re-written' doesn't work because time cannot be re-written, once something has happened in the past, it is fixed. You can alter the future, because it hasn't happened yet. But to alter the past isn't possible, especially not in front of your very eyes. And the ending, when singing unlocks the cloud belt? No, that episode was just a complete mess.

'The Impossible Astronaut' was a strange episode for me.Theoretically speaking, it was a good episode. But somewhere from paper to reality, it just went wrong. Firstly, many of us had been speculating as to WHO would be dying in the first episode, and to have it as a future incarnation of the Doctor was a cheap trick by Moffat. I was watching it with some friends, and when the Doctor was shot, they all gasped, but I didn't even flinch. At the same time, finally showing us the Silents was interesting, but after the huge buildup of them 'Being scarier than the Weeping Angels', they fell below expectations. In my opinion, they are super parasites. They make us do things, but make us THINK that we want to do them. So, we stay happy, and they get a benefit, everyone wins. (Like in 'Partners in Crime', the Adipose get babies, and Humans get thin) The whole thing was made out prior to broadcast to be a huge, action packed moment of adventure. Instead, it was a bunch of awkward humour and buildup. 'Day of the Moon' delivered though, so it was all good in the end. River's character was just plain annoying in this two-parter, honestly, it took them four years to tell us who she was, I'd lost interest.

Speaking of which, 'Let's Kill Hitler', whilst a good episode, was a perfect waste of potential, and really was something made to tease the viewers. It was a total red herring, they could have set the episode anywhere, but they chose Hitler. And it wasn't even like 'The Fires of Pompeii', where the Doctor and Donna had to make such a huge decision, which would have been a perfect idea for this episode. So, whilst it was good, and showed us a lot about River, it was also disappointing. Bear in mind that all this is my opinion.",0,1314575050,null,0,false,0,c2fw4f5,t3_jwyvt,t1_c2fw4f5,t1_c2fvmbu,1427531066,3,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,3

true,army_throwaway_UK,null,null,"I went into the Navy first, but quit and joined the Army for a number of years. I left very recently. In answer to your questions:

* I joined because I thought it was cool. I was in the Infantry (don't really want to specify)

* Training is basically being deprived of sleep, shouted at and cold. The equipment is fairly awful, conditions fairly awful as well. Its only when you go on tour that you realise how useful everything you've been taught is.

* Misconceptions are everywhere. On civvy street, most girls think that an army officer boyfriend is going to be some sort of romantic aristocrat. This is completely untrue. Also (thanks to The Sun) thinking that every soldier is automatically a ""hero"". Most of them are violent idiots who are only in the army because literally no one else will take them with 6 counts of affray. Also that the Army is ""British"": there are huge amounts of Fijians. Also that regiments are accurate to their name (the Scots guards is full of people from the North of England). 

* Afghanistan, Iraq, London, Catterick, Salisbury plain, Wales, Bisley, Cyprus, Canada.

* To have a good plan, and do it NOW. Square away your admin BEFORE you go to sleep. In a fight, don't sit there at the back: take the initiative, i.e. move forward in the terrain. Hurry up and wait. Many more important life lessons that I can't think of off the top of my head. 

* Nothing in particular

* Young soldiers: Yobs. Older soldiers (Sgt and above): Fantastic people. 

* Officers: Aggressive people who went to Aberystwyth ~~Polytechnic~~ university. Cavalry &amp; Guards officers: Yobs/Snobs with lots of money, who probably skipped university. 

* Officers and soldiers are still very separate in the army. Officers eat in the regimental mess. You are served by waiters and use silver for each meal. The british army (especially the Artillery) have some of the largest silver collections in Europe. Soldiers will fatty junk food in a big canteen.

Looks to me like he is trying to suggest that we need to tie Jeremy Hunt's hands so he can't scratch Murdoch's back in return for support in a leadership bid.

In reality, the the government is already acting in this area. It is doing a communications review, which will definitely involve questions over media ownership, and there is the Leveson Inquiry, which extends into issues around broadcasting. So this issue is already being considered. That means it is easy for the government to demonstrate compliance with any motion calling for extra powers, because the matter is in hand. The government can happily support such a motion (like they did the last Labour motion on BSkyB). 

In fact, if Labour wants extra powers that's fine, but what should these powers be? There is no detail in this article. Will the motion have any detail? This is a tricky legal area and there are learned people already trying to work out what the law should say. Bringing forward a motion of this sort doesn't actually change anything unless you say exactly what this public interest test should look like.

Dorries's religious 'morality' agenda seems to borrow heavily from Republican politics in the US, and I get a sinking feeling that we might see the Conservative Party increasingly shifting to align itself with Republican-style conservatism. I think this is partly just because US politics seems to be part of mainstream UK culture now. The basic republican/democrat culture wars in America are well represented in most of the American culture we're exposed to, and I get the feeling that amongst the 'less-informed' segments of British society (particularly the young) this is shifting their political awareness and political vocabulary into the terrain of US partisan politics, which is substantially to the right of UK partisan politics. Young conservatives seem to be far more pro-American than they used to be, far more social-conservative/economic-liberal, far more vocal on issues such as 'gun control' and accusations of 'NHS socialism' which were not even on the mainstream British political agenda a generation ago.

My concern is that we are going to end up in the same situation as we did at the end of the tranfer window in January with Levy rushing into trying to sign half of Europe. It's embarassing and not effective. It's almost like because he got VdV on the cheap he thinks he can do it every time. 

Whoever posted the Guardian article the other day had it right - sometimes you have to just pay market value, or even above it, because the cost of trying to do it on the cheap can end up being something like losing your first 2 games by a margin of 8 to 1.

Now, I'm not one of those doom and gloom merchants who thinks this will define our season - it's a setback for sure, but we'll turn it around. I'm deeply pissed off with the Man City result though, I'm not liking the attitude I see from VdV, the bullshit from Modric and his agent, Harry using the press to vent and the fact that 90% of this was avoidable if Levy had just got his cheque book out earlier in the summer.

We have a right as fans to be angry about the mishandling of the pre-season, and it clearly has  been mis-handled. Not just from the transfer bullshit, but we were clearly unft against Man Utd in the second half and they ran us ragged for the last 30 minutes. Can blame it on missing the Everton match I guess, but it all just adds up into a bit of a farce at the club at the moment.

In the last two seasons, all of the characters have been killed too often. (Except River. Has she ""died"" at all?)

IMHO, the death of a character, especially a main character, should not be used unless the writer has the balls to leave that character dead. If nobody stays dead, the stakes are nearly non-existent. For example, [Rory dying in ""Curse of the Black Spot""](/spoiler) had zero effect on me because they are not going to kill a main character in a filler episode.

Using The Doctor's death as a plot device is even worse. Without him, there is no show, and we know the show is not going to end any time soon (especially in the middle of the season).

So that I'm not complaining without offering an alternative, here's an idea. Instead of poisoning The Doctor, just give him some kind of paralysis that has the same effect. You can still convey the same sense of helplessness, but it doesn't make death feel cheap.

I probably rambled a bit too much, so here's a summary:

1) No idea. We'll probably find out closer to the end of the series.

2) My guess is that the order of her regeneration went from being Melody Pond, regenerated into Mels, and then into River Song. We know this is the order for sure because River said in LKH just before regenerating that her last regeneration was as a toddler in NY City. Whether there was any previous regenerations before that Toddler, we'll have to wait to be Moffucked.  Also, my guess on how she got there is that the Silence used time travel. Last, on her accent when the Doctor regenerates he speaks differently and has a different accent from somewhere in Britain, so its not unlikely that she can have a different voice when she does too.

3) Probably just filler parents provided by the Silence. These would also likely be the people who brainwashed her.

4) If we discount the theory that there were lives before the kid in the space suit, then she regenerated once at around 8, then again as Mels at about 21, making her at least 28.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt; It could be desensitizing and take out the suspense a bit, but honestly, do we ever think that those characters are going to die and stay dead?

No. I don't think anything so silly.

&gt; When it really happens, it'll be impossible to cope with.

What if instead of ""dying"" they just go to a parallel universe from which escape is impossible?

Then they can come back any time they damned well please.

Hell, if the character has every atom buried in a separate star in a separate universe, the phrase ""time can be rewritten"" will just bring them back any time some ""wibbly wobble timey wimey bow ties are cool"" fan service seems necessary.

I don't care how hard it will be for you to cope with, when RTD was in charge, Rose's dad died, and stayed dead, and trying to fix that had *consequences*.

Now the entire universe can be blown up every other episode and it means nothing.

It doesn't matter if they kill a character and take the name out of the opening credits, it won't mean as much because they've already said they will happily bring them back any time they want.

&gt; As for Matt Smith's regeneration, I think it won't lose anything, because it'll mean that he, the actor, is leaving and that will be heart-wrenching.

Despite the wailing and gnashing of teeth, people got over David. You'll get over Matt.

However, his agent makes more money if he transfers every few seasons than if he commits to one club for a long period of time at arguably a below par wage. So his agent is going to prefer to keep Modric moving towards a transfer for selfish reasons. 

Now, Modric being the respectable football loving kid he is has been forced into the situation of being stuck between his desire to maintain a good quality no matter his club and his agents whisperings about possibilities at Chelsea playing CL games and what Modric might be able to achieve, basically forcing Modric to ""think about his own career.""

So all that rave considered I am optimistic about Modric's attitude if he makes it through the transfer window without losing it completely. As supporters our job is do exactly that, we need to show him that what he has here he can never achieve anywhere else. He could join Chelsea and be part of their success. Or he can stay with us and be part of the legend that was the rise of the Spur's. Its a hero or legend choice.

Silence in the Library/Forest of the Dead: About the Doctor and Donna exploring the largest library in the universe and solving the riddle of its abandonment (Vashta Nerada). Oh also there's a mysterious woman who knows a lot about the Doctor helping them.

Time of Angels/Flesh and Stone: River summons the Doctor to help the Church eliminate a rogue Weeping Angel that ends up raising an army of Angels against them. Also we find out that River's backstory is a little more dangerous than we assumed.

Pandorica Opens/The Big Bang: River helps transmit a message to the Doctor that the TARDIS is going to explode. The universe ends and the Doctor has to restart it all by sending the Pandorica into the exploding TARDIS. River helps Amy remember the Doctor after all is said and done.

The Impossible Astronaut/Day of the Moon: The Doctor summons his closest companions to his own wake and gives them instructions to go back in time to help fight the Silence. River has her last kiss with the Doctor. (Technically this one could be seen as very River-centric since it turns out they are searching for child River in the spacesuit but we don't know that at the time of this episode)

A Good Man Goes to War: The Doctor raises an army to free Amy (and her baby) from the clutches of Madame Kovarian. The baby is lost but River turns up to inform the Doctor that she is Melody Pond. (Technically this is River centric as well but we don't know that until the end of the episode)

We have the bookends on River Songs life, we've seen the point where she becomes ""River"" (Alex Kingston's character) all the way through to where she ""dies"" and no longer exists in a physical incarnation. 

So am I wrong in assuming any interaction by The Doctor with ""River"" would have to be from a point in Doctors time stream outside of that of River?  So anything The Doctor did would possibly change what we already know to have happened, which seems to violate the general sense that you don't change things on your own timeline which he would do if he changed something in River's time stream at a point where they were both there. 

So doesn't that only leave The Doctor going back into the pre-River (Melody/?/Mels) timelines and having to be super careful not to do anything that would affect the things that have already happened in The Doctor/Amy/Rory time stream?

We also have some clues from the trailers of upcoming things,  there's a scene with an eye patched River. If we are to believe this is a real River, and not a ganger or other copy,  when is this?  It can't be before LKH, as that would have been Mels or unknown regeneration with the patch.  So it has to be after LKH, but before Silence in the Library/Forrest of the Dead.  And time just tied itself in a knot and my brain hurts. 

Hmmm… the episode in the Library was called ""Silence in the Library"",  has there been any discussion as to perhaps that wasn't even River in the Library?  Perhaps that was a Ganger.   Or was that truly River, and she has always been a follower of The Silence movement.

I didn't flinch when the Doctor died either, but the idea of it being a future Doctor is great imo. It's very clever. The Doctor dies, but we still get to have him around, because it's a different point in the time stream. I love that sort of wibbly wobbly stuff.

The Doctor could do that but being the main character, and his older lives being from the 60's-80's, that wasn't going to happen and probably still won't.

You're totally right on the defensive leadership issue - I can't stand this idea that Dawson has it in spades because he's our Mr Tottenham and plays with ""passion"" - they're really not the same thing. The most galling thing is that we have defensive leaders, but King and Gallas aren't fit now, and we'll be lucky if either of them is regularly all season - King is one of the best defensive leaders ever to play; it's shit that he's still so fucked.

All these injuries at the start of the season and seeing Woodgate put in another top-class 90 minutes for Stoke makes me wonder whether our fitness staff needs to be sacked and replaced.

I’ve rambled on about my own situation quite a bit but I suppose my point is that University is not the ultimate answer for everything, and is often sold hard to students post GCSE.

For instance, in the early 70s the show went through a *massive* restructuring; new Doctor (Pertwee), new companions (The Brig, Liz Shaw and Jo Grant), new setting (almost completely earth-bound), new showrunners (Barry Letts, Terrance Dicks), and all broadcast in colour! Then, with another change of Doctor in '74, the show changed once again, with the Doctor (T. Baker) becoming the time-and-space-fairing nutter last seen in '69, yet easily distinguishable from any of the previous eras. 

Just as people some lamented the change from Docs 1 to 2 (early audience reports indicated that people *detested* Troughton's Doctor), they would do for Docs 2 to 3, 3 to 4 and so on. The 'cozyness' of the RTD years compared to the Moffat years is something that could best be compared to the switch from Letts/Dicks to Hinchcliffe/Holmes in '74, where vast swathes of 'familiar' characters and settings were swept aside in favour of whole seasons filled with outer-space monster-movie pastiches. The tone between Seasons 11 and 13 changes rather abruptly, with Season 12 acting as the 'transition year', much as Series 5 bridges Series 4.5 - 6.

Really though, I don't think this level of 'arc intensity' is sustainable; this series is setting up something *big*, with River Song being only a *part* of it, and is likely to have major ramifications for the rumoured 'arc-less' Series 7.

It's not definitive by any means, but shall help me explain the point I'm about to make.

Mary Sues work when everyone loves them. Many books, movies, etc--are technically Mary Sue's or Gary Stu's, and they still work. Doctor Who is one example of that. Right now, I'm seeing that everyone loves River Song, whether she's a Mary Sue or not doesn't matter to them--she's entertaining, and something for people to connect with on some level. It'd be different if the Doctor weren't so hard to show up to begin with, but the only person who can foil for him is someone equally as insane as him. I -like- seeing a foil for him, even if it requires someone equally as outlandish as himself, having an equal, a foil, someone who isn't just sitting in the background and gaping while he flies the TARDIS and saves the universe yet again--is a welcome change! It sometimes feels that all the Doctor does is show how heroic he is. River, as well--I would like to see her be a little less than heroic sometimes but again, it's a kid's show. You're looking for width, depth, breadth, and height when most kids shows barely last 30 minutes and try not to have more than 2-3 characters. They can't just have River stab a man in cold blood or purposefully kill anyone. The prison thing I think was a failed attempt to give her some real background, but all it's done is make the Cleric's prison look like a cardboard box.

It wasn't just the Doctor saving himself but also when Amelia asks for a drink because she is thirsty because the Doctor stole her drink to give it to Amelia because she was thirsty... It's a great device for humor and for getting out of jams. It is a bit of a cheap ploy I admit but since I enjoyed the humor and fast-pacedness of the episode so much it was something I just moved past. In LKH we see something very similar when we find out Amy has named her daughter after her daughter. As for the ridiculousness of the Earth being all that's left... Well, you probably already know but choose to dislike understandably that they were in the ""eye of the storm"" and it was closing the entire episode (creating some suspense). The Earth didn't survive it was about to end and they had to reboot the universe. Although it's kind of a drag to have everything seemingly fixed within minutes after a cliff-hanger, I'm not sure what you expected the writers to do about the universe exploding, a dead Amy, and a locked up Doctor. I felt the entire episode was pretty brilliant.

Christmas Special- I feel like all the faults you have with this episode have nothing to do with all the things I love about it. I focused on the story, which centered on the young/old man and taking a twist on a story that we've seen a thousand times that actually had me feeling for the characters. I mean really, after how many renditions of ""A Christmas Carol"" I was actually angry to find out that Moffat was theming the episode after it, but it was done wonderfully IMO. And who are you to say time cannot be re-written lol?

The Impossible Astronaut- I feel the exact opposite of you on this two-parter. I loved that the actual Doctor got killed in a gripping fashion and then BOOM adventure in America. They kept the story going and made the Silence scary enough. But I feel like Day of the Moon is the more faulted episode as it took what I felt to be great build-up and just took a turn I didn't care for. Why did the Doctor execute the Silence when they did almost nothing to prove themselves harmful to humans? Why did they make it so these creatures had always been controlling mankind? Both are still fine episodes that I enjoyed but I had some hangups with DOTM while TIA didn't irk me in any way.

LKH- We actually agree on this one. I liked it but it wasted a lot of Nazi potential and I really didn't even like the way River was portrayed in it.

Anyway, Jack has that sonic blaster that shoots holes into walls. Then he talks about where he got it, and then the Doctor mentions that there is a banana grove there now. Then, later in the episode the Doctor switches Jacks gun with a banana, which is pretty much the same exact thing that he does with River in this episode. 

Also, River uses the same gun as Jack did there in the Library episodes. And they both have the same time traveling bracelet.

I just think it's neat that there are all these ""Jack/River parallels"" out there (probably others too that I'm not aware of), and that maybe they're worth mentioning.

I'd like to know how she arrived at that figure of 60,000 abortions being prevented- particularly given her record of [presenting fiction as truth.](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-11597664) I suspect that the actual figure would turn out to be a small fraction of that amount. 

Naturally there's no mention of the potential consequences of bringing an additional 60,000 unwanted children each year into the population. Presumably the plan is that all the women who previously wanted terminations would become loving and devoted mothers after being pressured into changing their minds. Make no mistake, this won't be about offering impartial counselling designed to inform a person in a distressed state about the options available to them, this will be a case of preying on someone when they are at their lowest and pressuring them to follow the option which the group offering counselling approves.

I think you're confusing ""hard vs easy"" and ""hard vs soft"".

No-one is saying that art is an *easy* subject, but it is, pretty much by definition, a *soft* subject.  Hard subjects (in this sense of meaning) are those like the sciences that are based on factual and formulaic learning - things that have right or wrong answers.  Soft subjects encompass the arts that rarely have any kind of answer at all, just subjective opinions.  There are lots of subjects that don't necessarily fall into one or the other, or span a bit of both.  But art isn't one of them - it's right down there at the ""soft"" end of the spectrum.

Utter bollocks. The economic argument for immigration is entirely bogus:

&gt;**Immigration is not a benefit to the economy and should be cut, say peers**

&gt;Immigration should be capped, according to a parliamentary report published today which concludes that record numbers of new immigrants have had “little or no impact” on economic well being.

&gt;Some groups, including the low-paid, young people seeking jobs and some ethnic minorities, may have suffered because of competition for work from immigrants willing to accept low wages and poor working conditions.

&gt;Today’s report, from the Lords Economic Affairs Committee, whose members include two former Conservative Chancellors of the Exchequer, seeks to undermine the Government’s claim that record levels of immigration have boosted the economy.

Modric was only moved into the centre at the end of that season because Palacios was suspended while Jenas was injured and there was again nobody else available for the centre after we nonsensically loaned out O'Hara in January (nonsensically for Spurs - that stint at Pompey was great for his development). We were just lucky things worked out then because Modric did much better in the middle than expected for such a small guy and Bale proved to be a revelation on the left wing.

Let's say you've saved up the money for a deposit on a house after many years of late nights and thrift. That night, Robin Hood comes into your house, steals all the cash and then gives it to a starving bohemian somewhere.

That starving artist then uses that money to attend a university where he studies, possibly ends up  get a degree (of varying class) and continues living his life. He may or may not continue with the practical application of his degree. The most likely career outcome is entry-level administration or low paid service work, although he may play in a band part time, and he may strike it big and become the next Hendrix.

true,nolhom,null,null,"Your experience sounds considerably different to my soldiers who recently have gone through phase 1 and 2.  Different Cap Badges are treated differently depending on their intended role.

This here is something EVERY serving Soldier or Officer who gets it comes to realise and is a great mindset to have before starting. &gt; I have learnt that people who sign up at 17 get a harder time than the older lads. I experienced that they are less immature and don't follow orders properly, they are more prone to misbehaving. I learnt to trust, and trust people fast at that. They will be there when you need them most. Make friends.
There wasn't really anything i wished i knew. I'd get taught all i needed to be honest.

The view you express about rather going to war with your Cpl than your Captain is one that is prevalent with many inexperienced soldiers. The fact is they do different jobs and as such have different exposure to the younger soldiers.  I can assure you that your Cpl wouldn't be able to do such a good job without Seniors and Officers doing their jobs even if you don't notice it. If you ask most Sgts if they would rather do their job or the Junior Officer's job they would without a pause answer the Sgts job. It takes a different type of person and a different type of training. 

On operations my 3 seniors were worth their weight in Gold, Diamonds, Platinum, Saffron and anything else you could imagine. They were the ones who taught me the tactical knowledge and lessons learnt from experience whilst I imparted the studied doctrinal knowledge and operational level knowledge to our group. Whilst my Sgt Maj was more than capable of fulfilling 75% of my job and me 75% of their job, that  overlap is the key to providing a good Senior/Officer working relationship leading to operational effectiveness.  I find it works well this way as it does in the USMC which I have experienced has a similar ethos/work ethic to the British Army (make do with whatever equipment you can scrounge and carry it on your back ludicrous distances).",0,1314618899,null,0,false,0,c2fzujl,t3_jx14n,t1_c2fzujl,t1_c2fuupi,1427532850,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

I get the stuff with the change in time and whatnot, but seriously, it just didn't seem to make much sense, and up until now, this was not a possibility. I mean, you have an entire race of time lords, none of them changed races and whatnot. It's a sort of weird revisionist history I've noticed on a lot of shows in the UK, where they insert people of color, or females in the past in positions they wouldn't normally have for that time period. I get what they are trying to promote, but at the same time it still goes against what you know is established already and it stands out way way more. (I'm brown by the way so lets nip that right in the bud).

Never seen the original episodes.

River's character is the only character that can fly the TARDIS besides the Doctor himself. She's even -better- at him than it. She upstages him in several ways, which is a Mary Sue trait, I will admit, but it's NICE to see someone who isn't some 'ignorant human being' the Doctor found on earth.  And the only person who -can- upstage him is another obscenely perfect character. I've wanted, for a while, to find someone equal to him, and since he's conveniently the last of his kind(which -he- has caused), it means we'll never see another timelord--as they've been playing up this ""last of the great timelords"" blah blah blah. 

Here's the other thing: I would like to see them cut him down quite a bit. More episodes where he can't do anything to save people. More episodes where he can't fix everything or save everyone, and he actually shows some emotions about it. Usually all you get is ""I'm so, so sorry."" and something about his burden as a great master race--blegh. I want to see him, every once in a while, a really broken person. Which again, probably will never happen because it's a children's show and the writing doesn't have to be that great(Power Rangers anyone?) for it to succeed.

And FYI, it's not the feminism card. It's a male privilege card. Males always expect to be the center of everything so when they're not--MADNESS! Cats and dogs living together! or at the very least they go 'it's a shitty chick flick!' and deem it 'not real entertainment.' It's actually not a feminism card at all, as privilege of several major types exists in Doctor Who: White privilege--the doctor will never be anything but white. Male privilege(as before), and Ableism--in the form of intelligence/superior technology to 'us stupid humans'. If he was vegetarian it'd pull in another round of it, but thankfully he's not.

That's part of a wider problem. We have a state endorsed religion, prayers before government meetings and 26 men in the House of Lords who are there simply because they believe in their god the most and were next in line to have a say on how we run our country.
So so often our public officials/bodies tell us how important we all think religion and our god is to us, and that 70% of us are Christians etc. They ignore the fact that most people don't give a toss about religion, or properly worded polls that ask non-leading questions. In our recent census we had the question: ""What is your religion?"" Fair enough, ""No religion"" was at the top of the list of answers, but as you can see from that link, a far better question to ask would be ""Do you have a religion?"" or similar.

the doctor is never perfect. he has never been shown as perfect. talented, yes, clever, yes. but he's fucked up and he's hurt people and he lacks humanity and this is a running theme, not a new steven moffat theme. 

your privilege cards are indeed a trump, and those are ridiculous. the doctor has always been white and male and it's not because the doctor is fucking privileged. the doctor can and probably will be black or female in the future if the show continues long enough, to be honest. river isn't annoying cause she's female. she's annoying cause she has no flaws. the doctor does. you have grossly missed the point.

the doctor is a great master race because that is what he is. that is the point of the show. you are essentially asking for the entire show to be rewritten, so frankly i don't understand why you're in a doctor who subreddit, complaining about the very point of the character, and glossing over the points you missed.",0,1314629486,null,0,false,0,c2g0nx4,t3_jx2lj,t1_c2g0nx4,t1_c2g03dh,1427533236,1,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,1

Yes, of course. Elementary math. I never thought otherwise. The show ending soon means they have a limit that they are approaching. It is possible to be on the 13th Doctor in as little as 3 years if they end up with actors like Eccleston, who can't bring themselves to work on the show more than one series.

They aren't going to kill a popular show because of a throw-away line that a writer thought sounded good back in the 70s, after only 3 regenerations had been done. There was a lot of speculation that the limit was legally imposed for societal reasons that no longer apply. There may also be a biological reason, as implied by Mawdryn Undead's packets, though those can clearly be manipulated. The issue is that nobody has said anything authoritatively about the limit in decades and it is getting close to the time when it matters. 12 may still be the limit, but they will certainly find a way around it for The Doctor or they will have to cancel a popular show for a dumb reason.

You don't want people to be completely reckless if they can just regenerate from serious wounds.

I hadn't heard that the regeneration energy is stored in packets in a Time Lord's body, but now that I know that, my guess would be that Time Lords naturally produce the energy and store it for when it's needed.

Now the trick comes in with Amy saying ""remaining regenerations"". It could be that River, being not wholly time lord, does not produce this energy and is just born with a limited amount of it.  Or it could be that all Time Lords have a biological limit that is higher than twelve, but is variable, so they set the law to twelve and River ate up all of her remaining biological regenerations.  Or the Doctor could have said ""She can't regenerate anymore"" and Amy turned that into ""remaining regenerations"" and River basically exhausted her body's ability to produce more regeneration energy, possibly by producing extra to help heal the Doctor.

Id sort out the dressing room by letting VdV take a swing at Modric. Then sell him to chelsea, where he can warm the bench and make the kind of dramatic impact Keane made at Liverpool, before buying him back and loaning him out to scottish football for a laugh.

Id tell Pav that if he really wants to remain at spurs like he said he did over the summer, then he can either start looking like he gives a fuck, or shut up.

To boost morale I would sign L.A Galaxy striker Robbie Keane who would tell the press its a dream move to a club he supported since he was a boy.

Im assuming that I am the Chairman in this instance, so I would sack redknapp and bring in José mourinho in time for us facing Arsenal resulting in VdV becoming frustrated on the pitch and trying to break Ramseys leg, in the ensuing brawl, Arsenal's assistant manager would nearly lose an eye somehow.

Id threaten the defence with severe penalties if they play badly, such as bringing back whatever members of staff are responsible for destroying the morale of both Paul Robinson and Gomes.

I wonder if due to River's efforts, the Doctor now has at least one more regeneration or not (though if we assume that he dies in a fixed point in time, then he will die before the regeneration occurs).

When River ""dies"" in the library, I assume that she wouldn't have been able to regenerate anyways as the Vashta Nerada consume the body and everything in it before there is a chance for the cycle to take place.  Though, this could be an interesting plot, as River being time lord or time lord esque, could project and control another being's body with her time lord mind (as the master did).",0,1314632335,null,0,false,0,c2g0zhk,t3_jxz8p,t1_c2g0zhk,t3_jxz8p,1427533386,6,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,6

I'm out of energy to nitpick the rest.  Problem is, if youre drinking the game has to be SIMPLE.  ""doctor"" and ""time"" is a good start.  If you must do more, it has to be catchphrases from main characters (that means only something the doctor or his companions say).

Maybe you should make season specific drinking games?  S1 - Bad wolf, captain jack scene.  S2 - Torchwood.  S3 - Saxon.  S4 - Rose.  S2-S4:  doctor says ""What?"" S5 - time can be rewritten, bowties are cool.  All seasons - drink your cup when regeneration energy is present.  Drink when the doctor tries and fails to get to the Tardis.

No, the author is not. Did you read the article? Here are a few snippets: ""River Song’s various ­time-travelling incarnations have so far required SIX different actresses to play her, apparently. I just wish Alex Kingston wasn’t one of them. [...] Whereas the rest of the cast play their parts perfectly ­naturally – even Matt Smith, who is the ultimate alien – you can see Kingston acting.

Yeah they get around it on occasion, but the basic principle is still there so that when they get around it, the situation has to be important and significant. Without the time limit on regenerations the whole show and the Doctor's actions mean a little less. There is a big difference between the reasons for doing something if you are nearly immortal rather then truly immortal and can always count on getting more regenerations. 

I really worry that if they keep it going the story will lose it's legitimacy, you'll never take the Doctor getting sick, or hurt seriously because you always know they'll just regenerate him. Everytime he gets hurt now, it's a big deal. Only 2 more left ect. 

Stories have endings; a character that isn't immortal must eventually die or ascend to another level or something.

&gt;Whereas the rest of the cast play their parts perfectly ­naturally – even Matt Smith, who is the ultimate alien – you can see Kingston acting.

From all this it seems like half his criticism is for the writing of the character, but at least half is reserved for Kingston herself.

That's untrue.  As such what matters here is what you publicly proclaim, and you proclaim taking without paying.

&gt; It is my property and I never authorized it, but nothing was ever stolen.

But somehow that's still ok?

There are different scenarios here.  Yours are around physical theft and presumes the only thing that matters is physical loss, I proclaim there's more than that, there's the owners wishes and rights too.  There is IP theft, there is ownership theft.  Stealing can go beyond physical items, and our law recognizes that.


&gt; But please note, I have never once argued that this was the right

The problem is you don't argue it's wrong, so you de-facto support it and give credence to others doing it too.

&gt; I'm giving them more money 

You don't know that.  Have you actually gone without Pirating Doctor Who and waited until the DVDs come out?  You don't know if you'd actually pay for the individual episodes on Amazon for $3 a piece, or if you'd instead Rent of $1 on iTunes, and you don't know if you'd still then buy the DVDs or perhaps ask for them for christmas or a birthday.  You have removed the market forces on yourself, so you really don't know what you'd do because you aren't allowing yourself to make those decisions.

Also, the studios are the ones who decide what money with worth at what time.  Maybe they prefer the lower up front per episode money than the later DVD money, maybe they actually get more off of the amazon episodes.

true,panickedthumb,pertwee,Pertwee,"&gt; As such what matters here is what you publicly proclaim

Couldn't agree more. Where did I publicly proclaim that I never showed the BBC that I don't like the way they handle their distribution? Where did I say that I don't know what I would do with my money? These are things you're putting on me. You don't know me, and you don't know what I would do with my money.

&gt; You don't know that. 

You seem to think you have a way to see inside my mind. Trust me, you don't.

&gt; You don't know if you'd actually pay for the individual episodes on Amazon for $3 a piece, or if you'd instead Rent of $1 on iTunes

As I've said in the past, I don't support the kind of DRM that won't allow me to play media where I want to watch it. I have no interest in renting or buying anything on Amazon or iTunes. If Amazon let me buy the lost Eric Stoltz back to the future, which is something I desperately want to see, I wouldn't buy it.

EDITED TO ADD: also, I have friends with BBC America. I prefer to watch it uncut, and on my own couch, but without that option my friends who like Doctor Who would be what I would do pre-DVD's.

&gt; and you don't know if you'd still then buy the DVDs or perhaps ask for them for christmas or a birthday. 

If I owned them one way I certainly wouldn't want them another way. That's a significant waste of money.

&gt; The point is, it's their decision how to offer it and you are removing their ownership of controlling their property.

I have never argued against this part.

Fish fingers and custard is the cure for the Judas Tree poison. The Doctor races back in time to Amelia Pond's house and crashes the TARDIS because he is ill.

Also, time can be (and I suspect is being) rewritten.

So, now cured, The Doctor returns to the time of his poisoning and *acts* like he's dying (the whole outfit and cane plays into this) in order to trick Melody into becoming River. The time energy Melody-River expended was nothing more than fun effects.

This bit always confused me. The doctor never seems to have control over his regenerations, but in The Destiny of the Daleks Romana goes through various regeneration options before choosing the body of Princess Astra. Why is it that Romana can choose her regenerations but the Doctor can't? I'm not sure River has any say in it either, but I do think it's interesting that apparently some Timelords(ladies) can.

true,panickedthumb,pertwee,Pertwee,"Moffat has said that one of his friends very cheekily resolved the regeneration limit. It was suspected that either Davies did something that everyone missed, or that Gaiman was going to in The Doctor's Wife. TDW came and went, and there was nothing obvious, but here are ~~two~~ *three* things to consider:

1) Melody was born part Time Lord from absorbing the time vortex energy in the TARDIS. The interaction with the vortex is what makes Gallifreyans Time Lords, and what allows them to regenerate. There is only one Time Lord left, and he's constantly interacting with the time vortex. With so much time vortex energy and only one Time Lord to absorb it, he may have been constantly absorbing and replenishing his regenerations. He may be up to over 500 by now, with no Time Lord society to regulate it.

2) Another possibility is that something during the time war caused it. This could be a simple explanation, if they want to use it, but not very interesting.

3) This is where Gaiman comes in-- In The Doctor's Wife, The Doctor not only interacts with the Time Vortex personified, but he's in the TARDIS control room when she dissipates, **and he travels through the time vortex with no shielding in the frankenTARDIS.** If someone is going to absorb time vortex energy, there's the golden opportunity.

Regardless of how they do it, I hope it's a climactic moment when The 13th Doctor is on his way out, convinced that he won't be able to regenerate, but figures out at the last minute that he still can (or doesn't figure it out, but tries anyway and pulls it off).

My concern is not just an inconvenience. I'm not asking people to wait to talk about it. I myself enjoy talking about the show. I only ask for titles to not contain episode spoilers or start with [spoiler] so i can avoid reading the rest of the title. In the past threads used to start with ""Episode X theory!"", there was nothing wrong with that because i could save it for reading after I watched it.

Now, some people can avoid reddit for 4 hours till it airs in the US. But for me, and many others, on-demand and hulu are the first choice short of downloading the episode. Those are delayed a couple of days. I think it's reasonable that an episode, particularly an important one, to have a status of limitations of a couple of days (Just titles, again).

So in this case, my options are either a total reddit blackout, or remove /r/doctorwho from the front page. I chose the latter for obvious reasons.

The Silence is a religious order with the ultimate goal of answering ""the question."" The Justice Department robot was a member of the Silence, as were the creepy forget-me-monsters, but neither tried to kill or harm the Doctor.

Maybe the Silence are not allied with Kovarian. In fact, maybe they are fighting the Doctor's war for him. 
We know River escaped the Silence in 1969. Maybe the Silence had built the suit to de-brainwash her, but before it could be used she escaped and found Kovarian again. Or maybe she went straight to Britain to grow up with her parents (still weird to me). 

I'm sure the question is somehow related to the Doctor. But none of the Silence seem to hate him like Kovarian does--they actually seem reverent of him. He's probably a central part of their religion, and they are probably the ones who imprison River.

true,DogBotherer,null,null,"&gt;No, what he's saying is that female (and to a lesser extent male) TV presenters get their jobs based, to a certain degree, on what they look like. So its not completely ridiculous for TV channels to want to replace older presenters with younger ones, and generally men age better than women

I think that's pretty much what I said isn't it?  They live (aka get their jobs) and die (aka lose their jobs) by their looks, and men keep theirs longer.  I guess there might be some broad truth to it, it's partly a question of genes, both those of the people doing the ageing and the selfish one which tends to make men attracted to women of child-breeding age, but there are definitely ethnic differences too (East/SE Asian people tend to look pretty much the same well into middle age and then put on all the years at once), and there are also cultural issues too - there's been a strong 'promotion' of older women's sexuality/looks in Western societies over the last few decades via television/film etc., so it's a bit of a catch 22 situation. 

As I say, it's not the first thing I think of when I watch the news, albeit these days I get 95% of my news from the Internet and I'm probably an outlier anyway.  I think the study you refer to probably contains some truth, there've been similar studies and simply anecdotal self-reports which show women dress for women not for men and that they tend to be far more critical of each other's looks/dress-sense than we are of them.",0,1314664407,null,0,false,0,c2g50fw,t3_jy1z2,t1_c2g50fw,t1_c2g4amo,1427535360,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

Do they actually generate a profit though?

&gt; why people care so much about other peoples abortions.

Well that'd be because they see it as taking away life and their god likes life (apart from in the book where he doesn't care about it etc.)

edit - Been searching and it seems that no, aside from private clinics, the biggest abortion providers don't make a profit.

&gt; [Aside from the fact that we trust private health care providers](http://www.abortionrights.org.uk/content/view/390/1/) in other areas of medicine to offer unbiased and accurate information to patients, even though they may have a financial interest in providing treatment, it should be remembered that abortion providers such as Marie Stopes and BPAS are registered charities, they are not for-profit organisations.

I still think we should be able to compete with the Manchester teams.

true,busstopboxer,null,null,"This piece is a little unfair in that Huddlestone was obviously not fully fit so Redknapp's options weren't that obvious. I agree Livermore should have got the nod rather than Modric - the Croatian's first competitive appearance of the year should have been as a last half hour sub, entering to a likely 'please don't go' standing ovation. Livermore and Kranjcar coped well with United on Monday, until we got into the last half hour and suddenly the disrupted preseason started to catch up with everyone - Redknapp should have stuck with the same pair and seen how they looked with a game under their belts. It's worth noting how much the team picked up when Livermore eventually did come on and there was finally someone properly competing for the ball in the centre. I wonder if we wouldn't have maybe got at least another goal back had we not been reduced to 10 by van der Vaart's dodgy hamstring.

There was also the possibility of Kaboul playing the destructive central midfield role - he did it often at Pompey. He's not amazing there, but he's not bad on the ball for a big centre back, and we needed someone putting themselves about and doing that job in the middle. I'd have rather seen that than the somewhat capitulating non-presence of the Kranjcar/Modric pairing - not that I'm blaming them necessarily, it was definitely wrong choice of players more than poor player performance. Kranjcar may not have missed a pass early on, but I'm not sure he ever won the ball either, which wouldn't have been a problem alongside Livermore or Kaboul who'd be doing that for him, but alongside Modric...

The more egregious error on Redknapp's part was playing Crouch up front - he was never close to giving them something to think about, let alone stretching the defence a bit. Defoe's not ideal but I still rather like him, and I think he would have given us more in this game - he certainly looked sharper when he came on than he had on Monday. With him instructed to stay on the centre backs' shoulders we might have found a little more space in the middle and made life a little more difficult for Barry.

Don't see Redknapp going anywhere anytime soon - these shortcomings are hardly news when it comes to him. You don't make Redknapp your manager for his tactical acumen, you do it because he has a good history of getting more out of players than other managers have by putting together a basic framework that lets them play the way they like to. Get rid of the some of the deadwood and the temptation to play Crouch again and I don't think we'll have a bad season with him at all - plenty of chance of keeping up with Liverpool and Arsenal, maybe even Chelsea if they don't get their act together in AVB's first season.",0,1314672927,null,0,true,0,c2g62g3,t3_jyh9t,t1_c2g62g3,t3_jyh9t,1427535854,2,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,2

true,Atomicide,num22,,"I think there are two extremes of tactics. Rigid and Fluid tactics. 

The first relies in planning, preperation, and a solid gameplan than has to be backed up by a fit and disciplined team. You don't rely on the tactic being perfect vs team X, but you rely on it being executed consistently and as near flawlessly as possible. It needs to be strong defensively. Tottenham played a lot of this last season which shows in the many small-margin-low-scoring wins we had. Its a strong safe bet and relies on shutting down every avenue the opposing team tries. Its countered by incredible ingenuity, or by the opposing team doing the same thing, but executing it better or holding out for longer. 

This is how the city game panned out. 2 Teams with solid gameplans, theirs was just better and we didn't have the right tools to react effectively and shut it down properly, so theirs over-ran ours as we had few reactive options.

Fluid tactics are more reliant on letting a team lay out their plan for you, then working the players to exploit potential weaknesses. You need intelligent, creative players. You also need patience as you have to pick away till you get your opening.  This is essentially how united beat us. We controlled the game and held them back for a fair amount of time, then fitness seemed to let us down, and juust picked us apart. Look at the Arsenal game as well. Arsenal had so few options they basically had to field the best they could and try and rely on holding strong and steady. United reacted to each mistake and tore them apart. 

You also get the potential downside of a fluid tactic in that match: you are more likely to leak a goal or two, especially if you are doing well going forward because more and more players move into an attacking frame of mind. You try to counter this by opening up a higher scoring margin, evident in 8-2. If you get two fluid teams battling it out, you get the end to end games that end up in score-draws, or 4-3 wins etc.

This is just my personal look on it, no team would be totally rigid, and no team would be 100% fluid though but they would tend towards one side or the other. We are a more rigid team but more than capable of delivering a swift and fluid kick to the nads of our opponents. Its predictable play, but harry relies on it being done well enough that an opponent cant stop you even if they know what you are going to do.

The problem we have at the minute is we have an unsettled team, we have no idea who is coming or going, where people are going to fit in. Its the start of the season as well and everyone wants to prove themsevles which can lead to riskier play, people burning themselves out (VdV) and people out of position giving us a shaky base (Krancjar).

There, I said it.

I love 10, I really do, he's my second-favorite, but he was such a angst machine. 11 has too much childlike wonder and hyperactivity to stay down for long. 10 was a sad puppy. 11 is a happy, bouncy puppy that's super excited to meet you at the door and just wants pets and a belly rub from his friends.

I'm also very, very fond of 11's acting. Matt Smith's emotional range is intense and incredible, he's an amazing actor even though he's relatively unknown.

11 is also cuter. I like his dorky professor outfit, his stupid flippy hair, and he's not as skinny as 10. 11 is also great at making puppy faces.

Going to the Doctor Who Experience in London pretty much cemented all of my love for 11. He's just so goddamn funny and charming it hurts.

Also, Amy/Rory are my favorite companions. Followed by Rose. 

Donna was a good companion, but I spent much of the time wanting to punch her teeth in. 

I think River/11 fluff is much more satisfying than Rose/10 fluff.

Steven Moffat is, imho, better than RTD.

Now that I've offended everybody, I'm going to go rewatch all the episodes where the Doctor kisses someone and go to bed.

The alternative, of course is embodied in ""Woman in White"" from the End of Time, who despite playing a fairly large part in the two-part serial, is never really explained. Who is she? How is she important to the Doctor? How can she seemingly slip in and out of the Time-Lock? How does she know so much? None of these were answered in-show, so no one was really able to be disappointed.

With River Song, however, after years of build-up, the answers to her questions were *never* going to match people's grand, amazing expectations.

Really, the best comparison to this whole furore over the River Song Revelations™ is the fan-reaction to Tom Baker's '77 serial *The Deadly Assassin*. Prior to this serial, the Time Lords were seen as all-powerful, awe-inspiring, immortal beings, capable of imprisoning planets forever in force fields, acting as the defenders of truth and good. 

However, *The Deadly Assassin* showed them in a far less flattering light. Suddenly, they were all petty, mortal, squabbling, feeble-minded, doddering old fools. ""**WHAT HAS HAPPENED TO THE MAGIC OF DOCTOR WHO?**"" people cried, ""**WHERE HAS ALL THE MYSTERY GONE?**"" Fandom expectation, built up by over 7 years of Time Lord mystery, was completely shattered.

Sadly, inflated expectations are par for the course with a show like Doctor Who. With nearly 50 years of mythology to deal with, people are always going to get overly excited about upcoming revelations. 

If we were to ever find out the Doctor's true name, for instance, I don't think that even the writing powers of Russell T. Davies, Steven Moffat and (the late) Robert Holmes *combined* would ever be able to match fandom's expectations.

Fight: He freaks and attempts to attack the Silence, possibly making quite a ruckus or potentially even being killed. If noisy theres a good chance you'll check out what is problem is and more than likely see the Silence for yourself. If killed the Silence will move on to you.

Flight: Your friend freaks and immediately runs out of the room. As soon as he gets to you however he has forgotten why he ran. You both assume he saw a spider or perhaps a wasp. Depending on the actions of the Silence this could possibly repeat causing you to investigate and there goes your memory.

Freeze: Your friend is completely shocked into silence by the Silence and the Silence does his business and moves on, possibly to your room. And none of you ever the wiser.

Speaking of kissing... why is there more heat between Eccy/Rosetardis than Smith/River during the regen kiss? From everything I've read and seen in the Confidentials, it seems like Kingston is the one that's a little stressed by the age gap, and perhaps that was the thing.

That's exactly what we have now. Everyone is educated for free up to the age of 18 (although you can choose to leave education at 16). From 18 onwards there is plenty of support from free loans, grants, bursaries etc if one should choose to study further.

I think the analogy with the NHS as you say isn't particularly strong. There's no choice in being sick and I would say most believe it's a worthwhile investment as a nation to provide each other with healthcare. On the other hand post 18 education is a choice, and I don't believe it's right for those who choose not to study at a higher level subsidise those that choose to do. I say this as a recent graduate.

On a side not, I think as a nation we're loosing our ability to take responsibility for ourselves. If I choose to go to uni, I choose to live with the repercussions that brings.

Really, I think it's still very relevant, but not in the way people tend to look at it (i.e. an underclass against working people) so much as about the requirement to work.

There is a great division between those who can live off property ownership - be it as landlords, shareholders, money lenders, etc. and those who must work to survive.

Then we have to ask ourselves, is this really fair? That those who do the productive work are often living in worse conditions than the parasite class at the top?

Even the staunchest conservatives must agree that people should pull their own weight (they are all too quick to apply this to the unemployed afterall), so why do we allow this other source of leeching to go unchecked?

Of course I was pulling it out of my ass, I was just having an informal conversation, I didn't actually realise I was being held to academic standards! No one else seems to be citing reference. Anyway I don't think it's a massive stretch to say that more people study arts at university that subsequently end up working in those fields. Is that a controversial thing to say? I thought that was the conventional wisdom.

Of course you could say that someone studying arts is generally a useful pursuit and that they will leave university enriched to the point where the time spent was a net gain to society even if they don't use the teaching directly. That's a tricky sort of thing to quantify of course. There clearly will be some benefit but there is also a rather large opportunity cost to spending 3 years actually doing it.

Cost to society is more difficult to qualify than you suggest. A 1 billion shortfall is small but the total cost is obviously this plus the actual cost.  Then there the costs in terms of actually having millions of people taking the time to do it.

In short, it's quite out of the way, and so it did seem a bit suspicious that it was the target of riots. There's many other retail parks close to the main residential areas in Enfield that would, to me, seem like a 'better' choice for rioters.

Like one of those romantic chick flicks, where the two characters start out sort of friends but not quite on the same wavelength, but then they get to know each other and it all sort of smoothly falls together.

Smith/River snorgling is a whole lot more chaotic, though. She knows him, he doesn't know her, or he knows her but she doesn't know him. They both think they're too old for each other, which is a weird take on the earlier Doctor and Sexy Companion dynamic. At the same time, one of the reasons I'm so fond of Smith/River is because 11 is a lot more... well, sexual than 9 or 10, and River is a lot more sexual than Rose. They flirt a lot more, they're all coy and teasing about whatever relationship they're hinting at. I was always sort of frustrated with 9/10 and Rose, because they so clearly wanted one another, but never bloody well acted on it. That one time, when 10 was saying farewell to Rose in her alternate reality, and took too much time to fit in an ""I love you?"" Fucking A that was painful. @_@

The one-sidedness can be a bit much, but it's clear that eventually the Doctor is coming 'round to what the older version of River seems to have with him. They meet in the wrong order, yes, but it sort of makes everything more excited and unexpected. She's slowly chipping away at all that awkward asexualness he's been building up for centuries.

Questions. I love them. I like guessing at there answers and I like being left in the shadows. That's 'shadows' not in the complete dark. We are given a millisecond to ingest something massive and then it's turned on it's head. It's creating too many questions and it leaves people confused. I get that they have to keep the pace up, but that's where a good story editor comes in. Whoever allowed Let's Killer Hitler to take place needs a serious talking to.

They have cheapened death and they have cheapened regeneration. How many times have we seen Rory die FFS? How many times have we seen 'regeneration' used. It's been cheapened. It's too late now. It's gone from something mind-blowing that the Doctor did once every 3 or 4 YEARS to something that happens every other week to badly cast BORING and quite frankly dull characters.

I hate River Song. I wish she'd never been in this whole stupid series. She is rubbish, she can't act and the chemistry between her and the Doctor is awkward and embarrassing. 

I know I'm old fashioned, hell I think Hartnell rocks, but PLEASE CAN WE HAVE A STORY WITH WELL... A STORY?! You know, where the doctor visits somewhere and meets people and solves something. In a funny, whitty, educational and enjoyable way?

I'd also argue that regeneration became 'cheapened' a great deal before LKH. The regeneration from Docs 6 -7 was easily 10 times more embarrassing than anything in recent times, including that cop-out biological handy-hand grow-a-doctor regen from *The Stolen Earth/Journey's End*. Even the ability to transfer regeneration energy has a precedent in *Mawdryn Undead*. 

Of all the aspects about the latest episode (a few of which I weren't fond of), complaining about regeneration, one of the most inconsistently flexible elements throughout the entire run of the series seems a little silly.

I'd also place my own 'biggest disappointment of Nu-Who' firmly on the The Series 3 finale. Horses for courses, though.

&gt;There is a great division between those who can live off property ownership - be it as landlords, shareholders, money lenders, etc. and those who must work to survive.

I disagree here, my own landlord has a regular 9-5 job. My partner's colleague (who works in a management position in a high street store) is a landlord but still works 30+ hours a week. Where's the division? It's a smart investment in my opinion and something I plan to do once I've got my own house.

&gt;Then we have to ask ourselves, is this really fair? That those who do the productive work are often living in worse conditions than the parasite class at the top?

What do you class as ""productive work""?

&gt;Even the staunchest conservatives must agree that people should pull their own weight (they are all too quick to apply this to the unemployed afterall), so why do we allow this other source of leeching to go unchecked?

Which group of people are we talking about that aren't pulling their weight? Are we talking tax wise here?

&gt;Ideally, we would change the system so that work is provided for all people, and the working hours reduced on all respectively. Meanwhile land is collectivised and banks and industry ran as national co-operatives to remove the leeching we currently observe.

true,TheCheesePirate,null,null,"&gt; Tim Vickery is an idiot.

Why do you think this? He is comparing the Coates situation with a situation from 6 years ago and concluding that they are ultimately different. I've found that his articles in general tend to be well-argued and informative, especially for a person like myself who doesn't devote a lot of time to studying the South American leagues.

Also, I don't think that it's fair to say that the difference in transfer fees represents a huge difference in class between those two players.I think quite a bit of the difference is simply representative of huge amounts of inflation in the transfer market in recent years.

Now had I been using older styled comics, this would've been easier.  Back when they were paper.  Now they are this glossy, slippery, shiny stuff.  Looks great, but it doesn't work with the glue very well.  So I keep applying glue until it hits it's saturation point.  It's odd to see.  The comic goes from magazine-stiff to suddenly pliable and flexible.  The change is sudden, but it takes awhile to get there.  I just kept applying wet glue until it became flexible enough to manipulate.  
  
It's best to start with larger scenes and to cover as much of the shoe as possible.  Then to apply the smaller bits over top of the larger scenes.  It's also best to apply all of the pieces to the shoe in one go.  
  
And then glue it.  Again and again and again and again.  When it dries, glue it again.  When that dries, glue it another time.  Do this about 4 or 5 times.

true,maskedcoconut,null,null,"While I think UK universities are excellent, to study here is becoming very expensive, and possibly studying elsewhere in Europe would be a better idea. If I was applying today I would put serious thought into going somewhere with more affordable tuition.

The current exception in the UK is Scotland where by a strange quirk in the law Scottish and EU students can study for free while English students have to pay fees. I don't really know how long this will last though as it seems so incredibly unfair to the English. The top Scottish universities currently are St Andrews, Edinburgh and Glasgow. My personal pick out of these would be Edinburgh. Also Dundee is also a good university in Scotland that makes a claim of being the most cost effective Scottish city for students.

If you can afford to pay the extra tuition in England and want a good cheap place to live, the main point is to avoid the universities in London. Sheffield is a great university which my cousin went to and loves so it would be a good choice. Generally the further north you go the cheaper rent will be. Most universities should offer jobs within the student union, getting a job say at a student union bar is usually pretty easy and simple. 

With cash you will need to pay tuition fees, rent and all other living expenses, this adds up to a lot of money and most students I know get by with the help of government loans and support from parents. Currently in England tuition fees are going up to £9000 a year. If you were to live and study in London, you would need atleast another £9000 a year to get by. Outside London of course you can get by with less.

true,Jafit,null,null,"&gt;but one thing I feel needs to change is estate agents getting a fixed fee from selling a property instead of a percentage because ( although it's obviously supply and demand too ) I'm sure that this has a lot to do with the ridiculous inflation of house prices over the last few decades

As someone who works in a property agency (although I mostly do commercial), agents are not going to kill themselves trying to squeeze the price up so that their cut is higher. Also it isn't the agent that ultimately agrees the sale price, it's the vendor, and that vendor is probably sitting in negative equity so their aspirations are unlikely to be in sync with current market conditions. They want it to be 2006/2007 again (as does everyone else in the financial world). So the agent can get offers at a reasonable price (for today's market) but the vendor won't accept them because they want more.

If things are selling and people are throwing money at you, then prices will rise, that's quite easy to understand. But in today's market where things aren't selling, prices may still stay high for another reason: Two agents go to give their opinion on Mrs Smith's house value, one gives a realistic appraisal of its value, but the second agent overcooks it. The second gets the job of marketing the property because he told her what she wanted to hear, that her house is valuable... *""Oh by the way that'll be a £200 admin fee up front, thank you. Oh what's that, 6 months later and no enquiries, you want to withdraw it? What a shame no sale fee for us, but at least we still have your £200.""*

In short, the percentage based fee isn't that important, agents would tend to prefer selling more properties at lower prices than less properties at higher prices.

This Guardian article explains the Scottish loophole:

http://www.guardian.co.uk/education/2011/jan/13/european-student-numbers-soar-scotland

*Because university education is free for residents of Scotland, under EU law students from all other EU member states are entitled to the same free places. Students in some countries such as France face annual fees and other costs running to thousands of euros a year.*

*But under a quirk of European law and the UK's system of devolved government, English students are not able to attend for free because they are regarded as citizens of the same member state as Scotland – the UK.*

You should study in Scotland while you have the chance.  It's free at the moment, but they are going to change that eventually.  

It's also a short journey between Glasgow and Edinburgh, so even if you study at one city you'll still be able to visit the other.  Easy to travel up and down the west coast, too.

On a tangent but this Doctor also has a bad habit of losing his memory, it seems to be a common theme. Some have theoriesed that it was linked to his regeneration.   

So yes this Doctor is cannon - but it's a bit of a weird grey area in cannon as there are failing all round. There is currently plans to take new images of Paul Mcgann as the Doctor for the use of the radio plays as they're running out of promo pics for the TV movie... and the test shots looked a lot closer to Eccleston's Doctor (does anyone have more on this?).

I love the idea that this Doctor was the one that battled the time war.

One thing we're doing a lot with commercial property is offering a lease with an option to purchase at a specific time and at a predetermined price, because banks are more likely to grant the credit needed to buy a commercial property to an established business than they are to some risky new venture. Leases with an option to purchase might be more of a possibility for the residential market if there weren't the problem presented by having a chain of buyers/sellers all trying to sell their properties so that they can buy the next one, in commercial property a chain isn't usually a concern.

I don't mean an individuals' home or money, but the ownership of vast swathes of land and natural resources, and of the machinery required for production.

The reasoning for this is simple, at the moment as technology improves and more work is outsourced and automated, we will see rising unemployment, recessions because of the loss in purchasing power and a great stratification in society. Whereas if we nationalised industry, then we can employ all people, for lesser time, and ensure that all people receive at least a living wage. So not only is it necessary, to adapt to the future, but it also allows us to remove a great source of inequality and injustice.

They also appear to have some kind of time-sense. Romana can sense time distortions and the Doctor can notice time loops. Nine says he can feel the Earth spinning through space and would be able to feel other Time Lords. Ten says can tell what events are in flux and which are fixed. The point is; their brains are *waaay* different.

As for physical bodies. Two hearts, internal body temperature of about 15 degrees, a ""respiratory bypass system,"" (I dunno what that is either) can survive in a vacuum for as long as they can hold their breath. They appear to be much more durable than humans considering that they can survive at absolute zero for a bit (42), have been shown to *not die instantaneously* from Dalek beams, can reverse the effects of cyanide by ""stimulating enzymes in reverse"" (the unicorn and the wasp) and can survive lethal amounts of radiation(Smith and Jones, End of Time)

Also, they don't age at normal rate and appear to have extremely good coordination and motor skills based on what little we see of Jenny and the Doctor playing soccer.

Here's my experience with Sky (trying to fix a friend's) vs. Virgin Media (my connection):

 * Virgin Media connection is down - 10 mins on tech support, try a couple of things, doesn't work, tech guy is out 2 days later
 * Sky connection is down - they tell you to try a million things, 3 hours later they say you need a new wire which they can't supply but will send a free microfilter out (gee, thanks!), and also if you want a tech guy it'll be £140... WTF!?

Okay, example #2:

 * Cable keeps dropping, I call up.. talk to guy in India.. he decides my modem is fubar, gets a new one sent out the same week
 * Sky keeps dropping, they say the modem is broken and please go buy a new one thx... !?

And you get this bullshit from them while paying them like 5x more per actual mbit/s.

true,[deleted],null,null,"I live in Sheffield now, but went to Leeds for uni, I have to say Sheffield's a much friendlier place to live. It is a bit small compared to the Leeds and Manchester, but there's still a good music scene going on, although obviously not on the scale of the others.

I've been to Manchester a few times and had always had good time, but it's always been to go to a specific event or night, so I can't really vouch for what the rest of the night life is like or the city in general.

Sheffield is friendly, full of hills (seriously, when I moved here I couldn't believe some of the hills they built houses on) and the city centre is practically built out of fountains. Sheffield is also much cheaper than Manchester or Leeds. There's a lot of small, free community festivals on during the summer and a big one called Tramlines that's also free. Can't really vouch for the job situation as I moved here for a job and I'm a professional now, so it's not really like I'd be looking at the same job market as a student anyway. Most of my friends have jobs and of the ones that haven't it tends to be by choice - but bare in mind, we're all mid-twenties plus. There's a fairly hippy/bohemian vibe to the underground scene.

Leeds is bigger, there's more money there in general and lots of call centre and data entry jobs due to there being a lot of offices there and also catering at Eland Road, probably some cleaning work too... also lots of bars. The student population in Leeds is HUGE and a lot of the night life is geared towards students, so if you want to get more drunk than you've ever been, this is the place to do it. There used to be a bar that was like £10 all you can drink, but that's probably illegal now. I wouldn't plan on staying in the city over summer, it just kinda dies when the students go home. There's a few things on, like Unity Day in Hyde Park and always house parties, but it's much much quieter in the city centre. The underground scene in Leeds is a lot of Dub Step mostly,or it did when I was there - it might have moved on by now, Dub step was kinda huge at the time.

If you can get a job (which isn't too hard anywhere, really - if you're prepared to take anything, that is), you'll probably want to take in excess of £3k with you to start off - and that's just living expenses while you look for work, without someone paying your rent while you study, you're gonna have to work a fair amount, make sure you can do the hours.

I'm pretty sure that people start paying income tax well before they are at the ""survive realistically"" threshold so I would argue that in an ideal world noone would pay any income tax until they had exceeded one of these thresholds, whereas those earning beyond the live comfortably threshold should be paying a lot more. 

There are way more people at the bottom end of the tax scale than the top, so to reduce the bottom tax scale by 1% you'd probably have to increase higher tax scales by maybe 10% so you wouldn't be able to get much mileage out of this.

Maybe people in the so-called higher tax bracket or above should be contributing towards their NHS costs for example.

I don't really think its an efficient or just allocation of renumeration if its possible for somebody to earn more than 100x someone who is working full time. I can't think of a better way of enforcing this than by making the incremental benefit of higher wages ever lower. instead of a 40% bracket for 34k+ and a final 50% tax bracket for people on £150k plus, I think there should be a 60% tax bracket for £1million plus, a 70% tax bracket for £10 million plus.

When Chris Jefferies was arrested for the Joanna Yeates murder (the Bristol girl found on Christmas Day) a couple of papers were found in breach of the act and the findings were that such was their actiosn that not only would they have put any future trial with Jefferies into question, they arguably nearly threw the entire investigation through risk of prejudice, such was the vitriol they directing at Jefferies who was found to be completely innocent.  After that, in this case, even the police refused to release names of people they were arresting so concerned were they that they'd be tainting future jury members.  

The media do actually have to toe a legal line.  Release it anonymously and create enough buzz and conjecture about it and they'll get a mistrial ruling on the basis of premeditated jury bias.  There'll be no legal teams telling people what they can and can't write as there are with the media.  No jury.  No fair trial.  No conviction.

'My clients have received public notoriety and association with guilt before the trial came to court, as such their defence has been unlawfully compromised and they are unable to receive a fair trial.' The next question is one that asks how they have been compromised, and the response is 'despite police wishes some idiot leaked it onto the Internet.

They're synonymous and they're not going to get a fair trial.'

There is no record of any ""colour"" being worn on that occasion.  In the first boat race, on 10 June 1829 at Henley, the Cambridge crew wore white, with a scarlet or pink (accounts vary) sash, honouring their Captain W. Snow from St. John's.  The second, 1836, boat race is the event associated with the origin of the ""blue"" (mentioned also in Hawk 1).  Just before the race, it is said that R.N. Phipps, of Eton and Christs, thinking that the Cambridge boat should have a ""colour"" at its bows, called at a haberdashers and asked for a piece of ribbon or silk. The colour of the ribbon was light blue, perhaps because it was Eton's colour, or Gonville &amp; Caius' colour (there were three Caians in the boat) or simply because it was the colour of the nearest bit of ribbon to hand!  For whatever reason, this choice of light blue, made in 1836, stuck; and became the official colour of the Cambridge University Boat Club.

Probably it made the most sense for the University as a whole to adopt the colour used by its sports teams....

I'm also not sure how much we can blame him for the failings of our fitness staff - he's not a sports scientist, he wasn't hired to be one, and he has a staff of them who it's only reasonable he accepts advice from - and our scouting staff - the Suarez decision was poor, but we were looking at a lot of players in a short space of time and it's entirely natural he trust the opinions of his staff. Lets not forget they weren't the only ones unsure about Suarez before he signed for Liverpool - the guys was villified for cheating in the WC, was on a ban for biting another player when Liverpool signed him, and though his record was good in the Eredivisie, Kezman's record was comparable when he signed for Chelsea and that didn't work out so well. Hindsight's a hell of a thing.

Saying we didn't get to see exhilirating football last year is horseshit. The Lane saw tons of good play, and we were almost always involved in one of the most exciting matches of the weekend. Often that was down to the openness we allowed in matches which gave weaker opponents more of a chance and we didn't manage win these matches, but in purely entertainment terms I've not seen more excitement in a season with Spurs.

Maybe you'd say he's poor tactically, fair enough. Maybe you'd say he just has a different and equally valid approach to getting players playing football. I don't mind that - it certainly produces entertaining matches - but maybe it's true that this approach can't take us any further. The conclusion that he's not with us for the long-term in a true legacy building sense is fairly sound in the end, but I think we all knew that anyway.

true,Spoonzilla,smith,Smith,"&gt;Perhaps the journal at the wedding and the journal he puts beside ""Melody's"" hospital bed are related in this way

They are the same book.  River has written about her interactions with the Doctor in that blue book since we first saw her, and when the Doctor realizes who Melody is, he is the one who gave her the book.  Since the Doctor was erased from history when he piloted the Pandorica into the TARDIS explosion, the book was empty.  River gave Amy the book to remind her of the Doctor.


&gt;""Something old, something new, something borrowed, something blue"" are the words Amy Pond uses to bring the Doctor to her. Where are they from?

Like other posters have said, it's a common wedding saying (I'm American, not sure about other places) and in the story the Doctor told 7-year old Amy as his life played backwards, he described the TARDIS with all of these words, making her remember him on his wedding day.


&gt;He would be happy if he specifically took the TARDIS to Amy's Wedding; knew his destination, right?

I think it was more that he was waiting for Amy to get to her wedding (Remember, after he flew into the explosion, he was trapped on the other side of the closing cracks and erased from history) and was checking to make sure he was at the proper place


&gt;Why doesn't he remember dancing? Is this boutonnière-less Doctor from a different section of the timeline? 

I have no explanation for the boutonnière-less-ness of the Doctor, but I think this was more of a nod to the fact that River knows the Doctor in his future and he was hinting at the possibility of them getting married and asking about his behavior at their wedding (their wedding has been hinted at a few times)


&gt;The Doctor asks, ""River, who are you?"" River says, ""You're going to find out very soon; and I'm sorry; but, that's when everything changes."" River blinks away with her time-agent, time travel device.  So how soon is that? Soon as in, roughly 1 season from then when they read the crib in AGMGTW , or, within 32 minutes when he climbs into the TARDIS and get back to Berlin? 

My speculation on this is that she's foreshadowing the importance of River in all of Series 6.  We learn a lot about her past, possibly even all of it.  As we learn about River, so does the Doctor.",0,1314763092,null,0,false,0,c2gf9eh,t3_jypsf,t1_c2gf9eh,t3_jypsf,1427540257,2,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,2

Remember when 9 gave his speech about how there were myths about him on the Dalek homeworld and that he was called The Oncoming Storm?  He indicated that he was, quite literally, the boogyman for an entire species.

Now, this is the *Daleks* we're talking about, so it's easy to gloss over this speech with, ""Yeah, the Doctor rocks, fuck the evil aliens"" but you shouldn't.

The Doctor can easily become a symbol of terror for people who have not met him directly.  I imagine this is what the Headless Monks/Silence/Demon's Run people ran into.  Either the higher ups partially fabricated the Doctor's legend in order to rally people to their cause or they are a legitimate reaction to a visceral fear that started when the Doctor visited at some point in their past.

We come from the perspective of, ""The Doctor is brilliant and good and loves to have adventures with humans!"" but you have to remember that the characters are not aware that it's a show.  Tales of the Doctor heard from anyone who wasn't a direct companion are probably more along the lines of, ""There is a man known as 'The Doctor' and he has the power to destroy entire civilizations if they displease him.
