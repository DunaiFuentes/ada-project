true,Gourmay,cnty-uk,Frog-Yank import,"I'm not sure I would call them 'propaganda' videos, you'd be surprised at the amount of people who have no clue where their animal products come from. I still love meat and I didn't fully know where it came from until relatively recently, I suppose if I had thought about it I could have figured it out but our society doesn't ever really make you question it. At this point in time unfortunately almost all slaughter houses should be shut down, 90% of the world's meat production comes from intensive factory farming, many of which still do things like beak-trimming which up until 2010, I had never even heard of, despite reading a lot. 

I completely agree with your point and I would also very much like to know if there are places manufacturing fur that comes from an animal having received better treatment but for fur to look its best, animals need to be killed young and in a way that doesn't damage the fur (thus anal electrocution etc.) and not be in contact with other animals etc etc. all this means 'free-range' so-to-speak isn't as much of a possibility for fur production. And to those who say 'oh it came from my great-grandmother', while I understand this wasn't an object deliberately acquired, the problem remains that it a) promotes the wearing of fur as something glamorous and b) there are shelters for abandoned baby or wounded wild animals which use this fur to make much-needed beddings for these animals.

One last point (please don't think I'm trying to lecture you, I just want to share my thoughts and what I know about the fur trade) an animal that's been badly treated isn't so much an issue for the use of its fur as it's often treated with all sorts of things to make it long-lasting, smooth and shiny. Oh and the cherry on the cake: the substances used to do that are very bad for the environment..",0,1294451436,null,0,true,0,c1bvexj,t3_exzsp,t1_c1bvexj,t1_c1bvc9m,1426679249,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

Private schools tend to pump out students with top grades on an alarmingly regular basis because of a number of factors including smaller class sizes, better tuition and support from teachers and the resources to help pupils pass their exams with exemplary grades AND go through the tried and tested University application process.

I'm pretty sure all Universities in the UK disregard educational establishments as part of their application process anyway. So when a University says ""we want applicants with AAA grades"" they can't distinguish anyone as the talent pool is so large, so they start using entrance exams and interviews as a means to test applicants for their worthiness as a candidate. So when a privately educated pupil comes in with AAA, a level of confidence nurtured throughout their school days and some training in what to expect - how is the University supposed to deny them access? Why should Timmy get a place over Tarquin because he went to a state school?

You're right to point out the failure in the state education system and isn't really a new problem either, the state vs. private sector has been an issue for many, many years and is only set to get worse. The Grammar Schools programme tried to alleviate the issue but I still think things can go further.

In an authoritarian system, it is subject to the whims of the ruling class, a far less appetising proposition.

The posting includes details of meetings being held in the USA but the WSWS/SEP are an international organisation, with a section in Britain. As someone who is also on a pittance (unemployed actually due to the recession caused by the banks) I not only ask you to read on regular basis and carefully consider what the World Socialist Web Site (WSWS) have to say (www.wsws.org) but to consider joining us. (I apologise if that statement makes this posting 'spam').

&gt;It's possible (to do something) because it's objectively necessary - the only way for the working-class to prevent a global nuclear confrontation, complete immiseration and further attacks on democratic rights is to build an independent socialist movement. The global economic crisis has already shattered illusions in the free market nostrums promoted throughout the 90's. Now the cables released by WikiLeaks have revealed the criminality, rapaciousness and lives that are the every day reality of imperialism.

Have you seen this?

2011 Conference: The Fight for Socialism Today

Workers and young people enter the second decade of the 21st Century confronting a social catastrophe, growing attacks on democratic rights, and the expansion of war. In its extreme instability, global tensions, mass unemployment and inequality, the world today resembles in many ways the Great Depression of the 1930s. A tiny financial elite has looted the public treasury and is now amassing record profits, even as the politicians and mass media call for ""sacrifice"" from the working class.

Everywhere around the world the conditions are the same. Workers face mass unemployment and an unrelenting attack on jobs and wages, while young people graduate from school drowning in debt, with no prospects for a job or a future.

How can these conditions be changed? Two years of the Obama administration have demonstrated that there will be no change within the existing political establishment—the Democrats and the Republicans. Defying popular sentiment, Obama has continued all the right-wing policies of his predecessor. The 2010 elections are being seized on to shift even further to the right. The extension of Bush tax cuts will be followed by brutal cuts in social programs.

A new perspective is required. The alternative to capitalism is socialism: the reorganization of economic life on the basis of equality, to meet social need and not private profit. These conferences have been called by the Socialist Equality Party, the International Students for Social Equality, and the World Socialist Web Site to unify workers, students and youth in the fight for a socialist program. http://fightforsocialism.org/

Clearly performance at interview for Oxbridge is probably the most important factor, as well as tests (and in reply to the comment about coaching for them, for many subjects such as History you can't be coached for them because they are designed to test a natural aptitude for the subject and are not based on specific knowledge/question types as other exams are) and quality of submitted written work.

That's a pretty draconian solution - deporting someone simply because you *disagree* with them.

You seem to have this weird, simplistic idea that there are two types of people - rapists, and people who would never, ever rape anyone in their entire lives.  That's silly - just like there are ""people who have littered"", ""people who would never litter"" *and ""people who know it's wrong but will do it occasionally for various reasons or excuses""*, there are people who will rape because they (*they!*  **They!**) have an opportunity and don't see it as such a huge crime.

Arrest rapists and throw them in prison or deport them, of course.  Even clamp down on people who *publicly advocate* rape, sure.

But the minute you start prosecuting people for their *opinions* (when they haven't done anything themselves or directly incited anyone else to) is the minute you risk turning the country into a police state.

And most of these people won't even have been *explicitly taught* that rape's ok - they'd just grow up seeing an imbalanced power relationship between the men in their lives and their spouses, hear friends, family and co-workers saying ""she must have been asking for it"" in response to stories about rape in the news, and the like.

Like I said, you were never *taught* that you shouldn't cut off a woman's clitoris - friends, family and society merely suggested to you in a million different subtle ways as you were growing up that that sort of thing is morally abhorrent.

Likewise, the same process can work the other way, where most or all of a person's experiences indicate that the people they identify with consider rape (especially rape of a woman ""who was asking for it"") a minor infraction at best.

Think about what you're saying.  Are you seriously arguing that we should strap down every member of a non-native culture, administer truth drugs to them, quiz them on their attitudes to rape and then deport all the ones we deem insufficiently morally outraged by the idea?

And if not, how would you recommend we identify all those people in order to deport them?

Is it disgusting?  Of course.  But is there anything we can realistically do about it *apart from* increasing education in an attempt to modify the whole local immigrant culture?  No, not really.

You already threw all your toys out of your pram at the idea of educational efforts, so what's *your* solution?",0,1294531481,null,0,true,0,c1bz2kv,t3_eyfnz,t1_c1bz2kv,t1_c1byyl1,1426680955,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

Until they commit a crime, you can't identify them.  Once they commit a crime, we both agree they should be locked away.  That's not the issue.  It is, in fact, completely irrelevant to the point under discussion... which is what to do *before* they commit a crime.

Only more victims and more punishment!"").

What, so the police aren't trying to prosecute rapists already?  Can you provide any evidence at all that the police are going easy on non-native rapists?

Because if you can't then they're *already doing this*, so a suggestion to do it is pointless.

&gt; it is a much more effective one than some sort of friendly chat by a toothless 'Muslim council'

It's not an either-or.  You can do both.  This is what I mean about black and white thinking.  Moreover, as the police are *already* prosecuting actual rapists, what *else* can we do apart from education and ""cultural pressure""?

&gt; The best way to stop future potential rapists getting indoctrinated into a 'culture' of abuse is simply to forcefully remove those within their community who would indoctrinate them, ie the current rapists and abusers.

As I patiently explained to you already, the actual rapists aren't necessarily the ones who are inculcating most of this attitude.  rather it's the entire culture which denigrates women and treats them like property.  And while we might not *like* that kind of behaviour, 90% of it isn't the kind of thing you can legitimately deport or arrest someone for.

So unless you're willing to deport the whole lot en-masse simply for their opinions, I don't see what practical alternative you're proposing.

true,Pyrix,english,Reading,"You've got some cyclical thinking in there. Prior to the recession, Labour's spending, while high, was not 'reckless' and much of it was considered sustainable because it followed Brown's 'golden rule' that deficit spending was okay as long as it fuelled investment which would have long term benefits for the economy, which it did because the UK economy performed very well prior to 2007. What you describe as 'reckless' spending was part of the solution to the recession and that which has created most of the structural deficit (such as nationalisation of banks etc.) not his earlier spending which contributed relativelty little. Therefore, since the global crisis was already happening when what you term 'reckless' spending occured, it can hardly be said to have been caused by aforementioned 'reckless spending'. 

Indeed, the UK's position is favourable to many other countries who have much higher deficits and total debts. Despite this supposed 'reckless spending', the UK's total sovereign debt is one of the lowest in the G8, and our economy is nowhere near as 'exposed' as many other countries  (Greece, Italy, Spain etc. ) because of how it was handled and the relatively good position we were in.

Also, RiotingPacifist wasn't suggesting that Labour were not the blame because they had similar economic policies, he was referring to two different things. One is that Labour's economic approach was no different from the other parties, and the second and separate statement was the crisis was caused by extraneous factors and not by Labour. The key word he used is 'and'. He did not use 'so' or 'therefore'.

Of course they're to blame, but it's dishonest to say this out of context.  They were following the policies of the Tories and the advice of their civil servants.  The whole British Establishment is to blame.

&gt;Labour spanked record tax revenues on an ever-expanding public sector, whilst also achieving record UK government borrowings.

You realise the economy's pretty much always growing?  Unless there's a recession, tax revenues are almost always going up and the public sector is almost always expanding.  

Again what you said is true, but misleading, because you could say it of almost any government in the past 100 years.

Who's to say who copied whom?  
The US has a massive deficit because when it wasted a booming economy on tax cuts for the rich.
Germany is still in deficit and has a similar public debt to the UK.
Poland also has a large deficit, as does the rest of Europe, though you're right that ours is higher.

true,[deleted],null,null,"Well you do raise a good point - that we can't simply raise corporation tax, etc. as the businesses will just move elsewhere. This is a big problem as we are reliant upon them for trade and employment now, as no nation is self-sufficient. This globalisation of the economy combined with the problems mentioned previously, is why we are seeing cuts being made across all nations - not just in Britain, but in Ireland, Greece, Spain, Sweden, France, etc. as the corporations can drive down taxes or threaten to move to somewhere that will.

As Marx wrote in The Communist Manifesto, the nations are like sorcerers overpowered by their own creation, as they are now powerless against the multinational corporations and private banks which hold them to ransom. The governments are little more than figureheads, a facade to pretend there is still some democracy, while we relentlessly march towards greater profits for the large corporations.

The only real class difference is between those who own the land and resources - the means of production - as though God Himself had gifted it to them, and those who rely upon finding work to survive. But the actions of the businesses and governments aren't part of this ""class war"", they are systemic, as the businesses _must_ pursue profit as best they can or else they are simply outcompeted by more ruthless businesses, and the governments _have_ to make the cuts to public services and tax cuts or else they face businesses leaving and a huge rise in unemployment, or the national debt increasing and IMF intervention if they refuse to cut services alongside the taxes. We cannot blame them for their actions for we would do the same in their position, the fault lies with the system that creates this behaviour in the first place.

I don't support New Labour either, there is hardly any difference between the main parties anymore. They all support privatisation, and cuts to public services, whilst the concentration of wealth continues.

It's completely absurd that we are facing fewer services and benefits despite living in a time of unparalleled technology, and a productive capacity that couldn't be dreamt of in previous ages. Is this really the future that our ancestors fought for? Where we cannot afford to fund higher education for all, are even making drastic cuts to the NHS and BBC, and the normal people face worsening unemployment and inflation whilst the large corporations still declare record profits?

The system has to change. Of course, it is not possible in just one nation, but we are not the only nation facing these troubles - look at the huge protests in Ireland and Greece against the IMF intervention, for example. If the resistance is united across nations then perhaps we might be able to produce some real change, to end the private monopoly on the means of production that creates the terrible inequality and the effective slavery we see today, and to create a planned economy and abolish money, such that automation can be used to the benefit of all and put an end to the short-sighted profit motive that leads to terrible environmental damage and the waste of human potential.

I can't say I'm that optimistic though, as the same technology can be used to suppress the masses, for example, with the infra-red weaponry for protests.

&gt; Churchill advocated the use of tear gas on Kurdish tribesmen in Iraq,[80] Though the British did consider the use of poison gas in putting down Kurdish rebellions, it was not used, as conventional bombing was considered effective.[81]

He lost in Dundee to the only ever prohibitionist to hold a seat in Westminster: 

&gt;He served on Dundee City Council and began contesting elections in the 1908 Dundee by election which saw Winston Churchill first elected for Dundee and continued to fight at every election thereafter, increasing his vote. In part this was because of his popularity, general left-wing sympathies and history with the labour movement. Churchill's stance against suffragettes may have had an impact in a city where many women were breadwinners, while many men were ""kettle boilers"".[citation needed]
In the 1922 election, Scrymgeour and Labour candidate E. D. Morel jointly ousted Winston Churchill, who had represented the city as a Liberal (at that point Coalition Liberal). Scrymgeour remained an M.P. for Dundee until the 1931 general election when he lost his seat to Florence Horsbrugh.[citation needed]

* Nature of the fee rises (i.e. how high they raised the cap to, Labour much more likely to have done it to 5,000 or something)
* Similarly, Labour would not have made 80% cuts to university funding at the same time as the largest overhaul of the system
* On the point of cuts, the speed and depth of the cuts would have been different (Labour were always in favour of not cutting too deeply too quickly which could destabilise recovery)

I agree an election would have been called like in 1974, but if the Tories had tried to cut in that time (and quick deficit reduction was one of their major policies) they could have seen their support shift dramatically. The Lib Dems would have been in a much better position second time round though, particularly since Labour would have only had a new leader for a short time assuming Brown still resigned when he did if there had been a minority govt. Labour's good performance in the local elections of May and the not-so-bad performance considering the crises of the last year or so also suggested that they were recovering at the time, a trend which could have continued during the minority administration. The second election would have been very interesting for those reasons.

Of course, the Tories never would have called a second election unless they were sure of victory, so a vote of no confidence would have had to occur. It's interesting though that the Tories have changed the percentage needed for a successful vote of no confidence from 50% + 1 to 55%, thus meaning if the coalition falls and it becomes a Tory minority government, they could survive a vote because they have 47% of MPs.

I agree that some things have been cut that shouldn't have and that perhaps defence spending, NHS and elderly benefits (increased pensions, television licenses etc) should have faced more of the fiscal axe (as opposed to other departments such as education). 

Regarding the speed and depth, I personally am on the wall about this. It certainly is a gamble but then so was taking no action. Labour certainly would have tried to raise more through taxes as opposed to cuts. However it is worth considering the unease of markets at the moment and especially earlier this year.

true,Pyrix,english,Reading,"The report was commissioned by Labour but that's no indication they would have followed it. I've heard Jon Denham speak a couple of months ago and he said he's sure Labour would have not increased it to more than £5000, as well as not doing it in conjunction with huge cuts to higher education.

I agree Labour need to do more to offer a viable alternative. They've suggested a better tax:cuts ratio but still haven't detailed the cuts or the taxes. Part of this I personally think is down to Johnson's appointment as Shadow Chancellor. His experience is not in economics and so we have two men in the two most important positions who are both 'learning the ropes'. Labour needed someone who could speak confidently about the economy and offer alternatives (with Ed's backing of course), whether that was Ed Balls or even his wife Yvette Cooper.

After the Tories' talk of the need to cut the deficit quickly, they wouldn't have gotten away with 6 months of no action, and this would have worked against them in the next election as it became clear they were only concerned about electoral performance. It would have been a double-edged sword. If they had cut they would have performed badly in the next election, and if they hadn't Labour would have attacked them heavily, and combined with Labour's recovering support, might have had a chance of at least stopping a Conservative majority.

I also don't think many support the cutting. They see the need to reduce the deficit, but also see that it was a banking crisis that caused the economic problems, and now they see banks still giving out huge bonuses. Many people would prefer much heavier levies/taxes on banks (such as the Robin Hood Tax, and strict regulation/high taxes on bonuses) and higher-earners so the recovery is progressive, rather than regressive in its current form (and cuts will pretty much always be regressive).",0,1294616450,null,0,false,0,c1c3cd4,t3_eyylk,t1_c1c3cd4,t1_c1c396i,1426682995,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

I think that Labour are a significant player - after all, they were supposed to be in control of the banks that operate in a major financial centre. All this ""it started in the US"" bullshit just doesn't work. Is there a reason why the British government couldn't regulate British banks?

No, instead, Labour (specifically Brown) cheered it on while the banks were making vast profits and the housing boom continued. 

&gt; Also, don't forget PFI was a Tory policy that Labour just continued...

There's a difference between using it properly like the Conservatives did (and sparingly), and the wholesale expansion of its usage under Labour. If it moved, PFI it.

This isn't even taking into account the way that Labour just couldn't spend within their means; instead choosing to borrow. But it seems that, yet again, Labourites are ignoring that aspect of their party's failing - instead blaming ""the bankers"" and the ""global financial industry"".

If the 20% VAT brings in more than the 50p, then it would be possible (although I'm not sure whether I'd agree) that the switch is a rebalancing of tax obligations. If they're bringing it back down to 40p then I'm generally in favour as long as they're not losing money over it (in which case the VAT rise is funding it, and given that VAT affects everyone and especially the poor this is frankly unacceptable). If there is evidence to support a net gain from a 40p rate, then I'm in favour.

Having spend several years on the net (and reading well-written factual books) debating and learning to expect citations and links to supporting evidence, it now bugs me acutely on the rare occasions when I watch TV or read a newspaper and see nothing but and endless stream of unsupported assertions and baseless opinions masquerading as fact, which you're apparently supposed to accept on faith.

Some of these I know for a *fact* are bogus reasoning or simply flat-out falsifications.  Moreover, even with the ones I *don't* know about for sure it seems ludicrously presumptuous to expect me to believe something just because News Anchor A or Columnist B or Press-Release-Rewriting-Shill C claim it's so.

I literally start to get itchy and irritable after a while, as I feel my brain getting *drowned in bullshit*, without even a token attempt to support or justify any of it.  I fantasise about a TV News show where citations and hyperlinks for the claims made by pundits and talking heads scroll along the bottom of the screen, or newspaper editors rejecting a column with ""[citation needed]"" scribbled all over it.  I would actually *pay money* for someone to build a system whereby viewers could collaboratively fact-check content in real-time, texting, e-mailing or otherwise posting supports or rebuttals to the claims being made on-screen, to be seen by all the other viewers.

true,alexgmcm,eng-sussex,Sussex,"&gt;One study of the United States between 1959 and 1991 placed the revenue-maximizing tax rate (the point at which another marginal tax rate increase would decrease tax revenue) between 32.67% and 35.21%.[18] Pecorino (1995) argued that the peak occurred at tax rates around 65%.[19] Another empirical study found that the point of maximum tax revenue in Sweden in the 1970s would have been 70%.[20]

From wikipedia. It seems we can't even agree where the curve lies... why are rich people happy to pay 70% in Sweden but only ~33% in the USA or is it 65% in the USA? Such a massive difference surely requires further research.

I would strongly disagree that we are currently on the right side of the curve given how low our taxes are at the moment compared to historical rates. Unless you have evidence proving why we are on the right side?

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt;The Russian revolution was full of death and destruction. The purges lasted years.

The Russian Revolution is actually considered one of the bloodless revolutions ever. The ‘death and destruction’ that occurred was not created by the actual revolution but by the invasion of imperialist armies from Great Britain, Japan, France, USA, Belgium and Finland to name but a few, who were  trying to other throw the newly created Soviet state. In addition the Bolsheviks were also fighting the anti-communist Whites in a civil war. In other words the 'death and destruction' in the Russian Revolution was caused by the government and armies of capitalist states. Lets not forget that the Red Army defeated all the imperialist armies and anti-communist forces...something I presume you would not find possible? 

While you criticise the revolution for it’s supposed ‘death and destruction’, you make no mention of ‘death and destruction’ being unleashed by the Tsarist regime that existed prior to the revolution. The fact that the Tsarist regime was conducting a war in which over 6 million Russians had died and presided over a society racked with immense inequality and poverty, appears to be unworthy consideration.  Whatever your political stance towards the Russian Revolution there is no way it was as deathly and destructive as the Tsarist regimes and the imperialist and anti-communist forces that invaded the USSR in the immediate aftermath of the revolution. But following your own logic, what the Russian people should have done is think they can do nothing about it and that the massacre over 6 million were just to be apathetically accepted, along with the utter poverty that most Russians were living in.

In regards to the purges, your suggestion that these were events were part of the revolution does not stand up to historical examination. The purges were anti-revolutionary acts carried out by the Stalinist bureaucracy against the leaders of the 1917 revolution. In carrying out the purges, Stalin murdered every member of the original Bolshevik central committee and ultimately led to murder of his most ardent and consistent opponent, Leon Trotsky.  The purges were anti-revolutionary.

As you ignore the object deathly and destructive conditions that existed in Russia in 1917, you also do that with the current global economic crises. The political and economic conditions of today have direct parallels with the 1930’s and 1917. Therefore, by historically studying how the capitalist system behaves under certain economic conditions, you can conclude what has to be done. The socialist revolution is an objective necessity if we are to avoid a repeat of the ‘death and destruction and genocide of WWII and WWI, not to mention possible nuclear annihilation.

Despite the bailout of the global banking system, which you claim will avoid 'marshal law and riots', this is exactly what has happened as a result of the pillaging by banks on a global basis.

We have seen numerous strikes, demos and riots, in the UK, France, Spain, Ireland, Portugal, Italy and Greece. Indeed in France, Spain and Greece troops have been sent in to end strikes and in the case of Spain, the Spanish government used an act not used since the fascist dictatorship of Franco,to send the army to force striking Spanish air traffic controllers back to work at gun point. Greece has experienced several general strikes and the threat of imprisonment was used to force striking truck drivers back to work and accept privatisation. In France oil refinery workers on strike were forced back to work under a barrage of high levels of police violence. We have witnessed several one day general strikes in Greece, Spain, Portugal and Italy and several student demos in Britain marred by police violence. We have extreme right governments in many European countries, Cameron/Clegg, Sarkozy, Merkel, Berlusconi, Zapatero, etc etc all implementing austerity measures against the workers in order to pay for the bailout of the banks.

My biggest nit to pick was in Season 2 and the heavy use of the [Idiot Ball](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotBall) when it comes to Alicia's and Simon's relationship. I think part of the charm of the show throughout Season 1 was that the writers avoided the stupid secrecy that plagues other arc shows (I'm looking at you, Lost). The characters are nearly always up front with each other and demand explanations for things.

This tendency towards openness went away with Alicia and Simon -- she should have been asking him every five minutes, ""So seriously, how come you can touch me and not get all gropey rapey?"" until she got a straight answer.

&gt;Whatever your political stance towards the Russian Revolution there is no way it was as deathly and destructive as the Tsarist regimes

No I'd say the Communist regime was worse and more murderous. But I also blame the previous leaders for producing such an unstable situation. Just as I blame the bankers for following riots around the world.

&gt;The purges were anti-revolutionary acts

That's communist theological debate. Trotsky and Lenin had plenty brutal plans for the Soviet Union they were just outplayed by Stalin who was a better gangster than the others. Trotsky was a not Mandela.

&gt; The political and economic conditions of today have direct parallels with the 1930’s and 1917.

Yes I completely agree, there are parallels. And I blame the international finance faction.

&gt;The socialist revolution is an objective necessity if we are to avoid a repeat of the ‘death and destruction and genocide of WWII and WWI, not to mention possible nuclear annihilation.

I don't follow you here at all. I like a bit mixed economy but anything like communism would be disastrous.",0,1294703172,null,0,false,0,c1c86fs,t3_eyiz9,t1_c1c86fs,t1_c1c6bn8,1426685273,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

To use any other figures is just dishonest. Given that this gives us a ball park figure of around £16.5k it shows how out of touch the government is [when a leading member describes £250k as mere 'chickenfeed'](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/london/8148899.stm).

If Argentina decided to invade again, we would be better placed to hold the island until re-enforcements could arrive. So unless combined forces from multiple nations tried to re-take the island I suspect we would be fine. British troops have actually been at war for much of the last decade, which makes a huge difference. Training is one thing but actually have people who have experience fighting and killing people is a huge advantage.

She told me about a recent case she worked concerning a gentlemen who had spent years working for the oil industry. His job was to locate cracks in pipes and this involved the use of radiography, something which lead him to develop numerous tumours (""riddled"" was the operative word). He had been called in for a DLA assessment and despite the fact that he was on constant pain and his doctor saw no hope of him working again, he had to appeal the decision when he was turned down. Welfare Rights then got involved and subsequently won his appeal, something which was naturally a cause for celebration. After leaving the benefits office the man in question said he would very much like to have a pint to celebrate so the worker walked with him to a pub that was around 200 yards away, a process that was very painful and took around 10 minutes. However, what they hadn't banked on was that a member of staff from the benefits office followed them and then told their superiors about it. Bang: The decision was overturned and he lost his DLA as one of the questions is 'can you walk 100 yards?'.

&gt;Also, I think it's slightly ridiculous to claim more people have easy access to play AVI files than DVDs. Everyone who owns a computer can play both. Everyone who only owns a DVD player can only play DVDs (and yes, they still exist. I know many, especially in the older generation). It should be obvious that DVDs are the safest bet for the largest number of people to be able to view the content.

Not eveyone owns a computer or a DVD player though. To watch a DVD, you need a DVD player, a PC or a modern console. To watch an avi file, you can use a DVD player with DivX support, a PC, a modern console, a handheld console, a portable media player, a phone, a TV with USB DivX support, etc. It's quite obvious that there are more devices capable of playing avi files, than there are that can play DVDs.",0,1294747793,null,0,false,0,c1cael2,t3_ezno6,t1_c1cael2,t1_c1cac84,1426686312,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

Secondly, I do know about DVD formats and encoding but that doesn't mean I'm going to release 8 .AVI files in a torrent and think that I've done my job when my job was to produce a DVD not a random collection of videos.

Thirdly, while yes, it's an inconvenience to the torrent snobs to download a .zip, it makes perfect sense when considering the global nature of this project. People in the United States might well have a 50 or 100Mbit/s connections, while someone in Mexico, Egypt or India might have only a 1Mbit/connection. On balance, it's better to have a smaller file that everyone can download, and faced with the opportunity of releasing a 3.85 gig file, or a 1.8 gig file that takes five minutes to extract, it's a no brainer.

You've misunderstood the nature of the Government's support to the sector. Here it is in a nutshell:

First off, Treasury didn't directly lend money to specific banks, it assumed direct ownership stakes (in RBS and Lloyds). These have not been sold, nor are there any plans for divestiture in the near future, because they're an utter shambles and nobody would buy them.

Secondly, the Government has guaranteed the bank's deposit base through the [Financial Services Compensation Scheme](http://www.fscs.org.uk/) and the lifting of the cap on protected deposits to £80k. 

Thirdly, the Government has guaranteed about £125 billion worth of new bank liabilities (issued on the commercial market) that has been issued since 2009, under the [Credit Guarantee Scheme](http://www.dmo.gov.uk/documentview.aspx?docname=cgs/press/pr20100419.pdf&amp;page=). Most of this debt is still outstanding, and continues to fall under the guarantee.

Fourthly, the Bank of England has purchased assets worth [£75 billion](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/7926018.stm) from UK banks in order to ensure liquidity in the market. These assets remain on the BofE's balance sheet.

Your comments from the episode 1 post say otherwise:

&gt;I know what I made - I produced a DVD in Adobe Encore which produced an ISO at the end of the production. The format of the videos within the ISO I'm not sure about, but we have a DVD, with nicely designed menus.

So, no knowledge of the DVD Video format, but ooh, menus.

&gt;If you can convert the ISO to PAL that would be awesome. I've been researching how to do it and it seems to be a major pain in the arse that involves rebuilding and recompiling the entire project from scratch.

So, no knowledge of conversion tools and techniques.

&gt;It's not MPEG2, it's .AC3 which is raw, uncompressed DVD footage. It's a massive file to share via torrent and compressing it seemed like the only logical way to do it. On a mac (which I don't use) it will delete the zip immediately once it has zipped...

Really...

Yes, the same person seeding on different networks means twice the speed. Honest.

true,loudribs,eng-yorkshire,2 'E's and some 'LSD',"Since there seems to be a few people who are currently or may be going through the Medical Assessment process, I thought I'd share a few hints and tips I picked up over the years...

1) Do not pull your punches. The criteria for awards is pegged against you at your worst so make sure you tell them how you are at your worst.

2) If you have a support worker, get them to go with you. It doesn't matter what sort of support worker they are, the mere prescense of someone with an ID badge will make the staff far more likely to at least pretend to be interested. Also see if they will write you letters of support. The only thing in this world more powerful than god and plutonium is headed note paper, especially when it comes to mental health problems.

3) Write stuff down. Often people forget to tell the staff critical pieces of information because they are nervous or because the process has been rushed. To counter this, write down everything that's wrong with you and retain a copy for yourself. Use it as a prompt during the session and physically give it to the assessor when the exam is finished.

4) Check to see if your council has a Welfare Rights unit. If they have, talk to them as they know the world of benefits inside out and will truly fight your corner. They are possibly the most useful people in the world to know.

5) Check your pride at the door. This isn't a stoicism contest, it's a medical exam.

6) Try not to blag the physical aspects. If you don't have a problem bending over, don't try and prentend you do and focus on what it is that really keeps you from being well. I know that some of the physical tests are quite demeaning, but it is an unfortunate hoop that you have to jump through.

You don't convert the ISO, you convert the video files.

&gt; Go ahead and find me the answer since you claim to know all about it.

I don't claim to know all about it at all. I claim you know very little about it based on your comments. But I do have an answer for you. You can edit the IFO files as explained [here](http://www.digital-digest.com/articles/Convert_PAL_NTSC_DVD_page1.html).

&gt;I know what format DVD's use. They use .mpeg2 in either PAL or NTSC but they're written onto the disk in a .vob container. Audio is converted audio to .ac3. 

But earlier you said, ""It's not MPEG2, it's .AC3 which is raw, uncompressed DVD footage."" Also, DVD's can use various audio codecs - PCM, MP2, AC3 and DTS, not just AC3.

&gt;You are just being pedantic.

I'm not being pedantic at all, you're comments are just plain wrong.

&gt; There's also no way to convert a finished encore project from NTSC to PAL, it's that simple. You have to recompile the entire project in PAL from the very beginning, it's very time consuming.

The entire project? It's a DVD not a library. I used to use TMPGEnc and BeSweet to convert movies I'd downloaded from NTSC to PAL. It was pretty simple and only took a couple of hours. That was like 10 years ago. If doing this in Encore is very time consuming then I'd advise you to try some different software.

Robot, The Ark in Space, The Sontaran Experiment, Genesis of the Daleks, Revenge of the Cybermen.  They form a sort of super-storyline which is just awesome.

The huge inequality would still mostly exist, and this in turn undermines democracy as the control of the mass media is concentrated in a few hands. [Einstein really wrote it best](http://www.monthlyreview.org/598einstein.php):

&gt;Private capital tends to become concentrated in few hands, partly because of competition among the capitalists, and partly because technological development and the increasing division of labor encourage the formation of larger units of production at the expense of smaller ones. The result of these developments is an oligarchy of private capital the enormous power of which cannot be effectively checked even by a democratically organized political society. This is true since the members of legislative bodies are selected by political parties, largely financed or otherwise influenced by private capitalists who, for all practical purposes, separate the electorate from the legislature. The consequence is that the representatives of the people do not in fact sufficiently protect the interests of the underprivileged sections of the population. Moreover, under existing conditions, private capitalists inevitably control, directly or indirectly, the main sources of information (press, radio, education). It is thus extremely difficult, and indeed in most cases quite impossible, for the individual citizen to come to objective conclusions and to make intelligent use of his political rights.

And there'd still be the problems of The Tragedy Of The Commons causing shortsighted overfishing and pollution in pursuit of private profit.

I think the only real solution is international socialism, where money could be abolished, the majority of menial work automated to free people from pointless lives, and the economy democratised so that goods can be produced in abundance and ""rationed"" to all people, so that no-one need go without the necessities of life whilst we destroy goods to maintain prices.",0,1294763959,null,0,false,0,c1cb652,t3_f06u9,t1_c1cb652,t1_c1cb4gl,1426686669,7,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,7

I guess IMHO it comes down to these three questions;
Is he a further risk to the public? 
I haven't read enough about it him but I think it unlikely somehow. He's 18 and this was only his first unescorted visit to London. That's pretty much all I've got to go on, but it doesn't seem like the description of a habitual violent criminal.

Is he in need of rehabilitation? 
He probably needs to be made really aware of how stupid he was but a small prison sentence and his mother would have taken care of that. 

Does he need to be made example of to dissuade others? 
Well yes probably we need to make it clear that this sort of thing carries a serious sentence but I don't know about you but 6 months in jail would be enough to put me off anything. Equally it's important to balance up the need to prevent the future epidemic in throwing fire extinguishes off roofs against how much this is going to destroy this boys life. 

Would it be different if he'd hurt/killed someone. I suppose so. For one thing more people would be directly hurt by the boys actions.

true,astley166,null,null,"The thing that really bugs me about it all is that people keep making out all of their policy is to do with making cuts in order to fill the immediate deficit left by labour. 

If you actually look at the majority of Tory policies then its easy to see that they are ideological in nature. The NHS is one key example of how 'cuts' are used an excuse for ideological changes. They cut through what they call (red tape) and destroy the PCT's, they state that this is because PCT's waste money and in order to balance the books we need a more cost efficient NHS. The way the politicians go on about ""red tape"", almost suggests their perfect system has a bunch of doctors who turn up to a hospital and just suggest ways of getting better. We don't want all that red tape like managers that ensure stockpiles reflect the demands of the patients, or a way that the patients can actually book appointments. Lets just have the doctors... then pay them £60/h to do the job that someone previously did for £8/h 

If you actually look at the white paper and its proposed plans, you can see that it will actually cost more money in the short term (despite causing vast unemployment). PCT's created a perfect middle ground, they found efficiency savings while primary care providers pushed for the top level of care. You can't have the same people who treat the patients also deciding the budget. Why did they decide to break this perfect balance? Because it allows privatisation of the NHS through a backdoor. 

Then there are the education cuts. While I agree this might make some savings (with a high cost to our society) at a later date. You cannot argue that this is to deal with the immediate deficit. The proposed changes won't come into effect until 2012. So what else do the changes promote. Further privatisation of the University education system.

They hired a complete sound system ( unnecessary) mixing desk  (unnecessary) a lighting rig (unnecessary) sound engineer (unnecessary) lighting engineer (unnecessary) full catering (unnecessary) themed decoration (unnecessary) and the bar was free all night ( I suppose kinda necessary ) + a load of acts. For a four hour party.

Put it this way there was so much extra gear that even though the party finished at 11.30 we were still loading out at 3am. FTR all of the gear they hired already existed in the club in the first place there was no need to hire anything. I mean we used to do parties for the large banks and finances houses who often had pretty large budgets, but I've never in my life seen so much excessive spending on one pointless party. 

I remember sitting there thinking: Well if this is where the BBC budget goes no wonder the TV is completely shite nowadays. Nick ( the venue manager ) was told to keep the budget to himself, but I'd say it would have been well over £50,000 if not a lot more and there are an awful lot of departments in the BBC.

I hope that the Lib Dems will manage to get AV passed which will be the first babystep towards greater electoral reform (hopefully towards full PR and an elected second house).

Voting in a slightly paler shade of blue just didn't seem worth it (although some Labour MPs support electoral reform to be fair).

If the public realised what a sham it is swapping this bunch of corrupt arseholes for another bunch of corrupt arseholes, the realisation alone might provoke some deep thought about alternatives. 

If no one showed up to vote maybe it would force open some sort of debate about leadership and what kind of society we need and want which benefits all and does not thrive on greed. 

Maybe Labour would be marginally better for the poor but this is the party that initiated the process which might lead us to becoming a real police state, they launched wars of agression and failed to take our civilisation's acts of ecocide seriously.

I am very interested in the energy sector - but it seems that the only viable alternative we have is nuclear power. Which can be made safer and more efficient via reprocessing etc. if there is no need for weapons material (this isn't the cold war, we don't need it - hell, we didn't need it then) but many environmentalists oppose nuclear power.

Wind and solar are also pretty good contenders mostly wind tbh given the poor sunlight we receive in the UK (considerably less than the equatorial average of 1kW/m^2 ). 

It is a shame the Severn Barrage was cancelled (although some environmentalists opposed that for conservation reasons) as although it was expensive it would have been a good Public Works project during the recession.

I think that research funding in energy should be massively increased in all areas (I am even optimistic about the possibility of controlled nuclear fusion in which we currently lead the world at JET). But sadly research funding has also felt the effects of the financial turmoil.

I think solving the energy crisis is paramount as fossil fuels are depleting and the discovery of climate change only adds to the pressure as it means we cannot rely on coal reserves. Nuclear fission could serve as a pragmatic solution to buy us some time to continue research without wrecking the planet.

It is a shame that solving the economic crisis (which is really just another manifestation of the struggle between rich and poor) has been put ahead of the energy crisis which is not a political invention but a real physical problem that will affect us all. Even more so when many of the renewable energy projects would serve as excellent Public Works Programmes. 

But what are your solutions to remedy our ecocidal crimes?

&gt;Participating in electoral democracy is providing yourself with a security blanket.

I agree with this to a certain extent. Also with growing inequality and a slowing of social mobility (which condemns many to a life with no chance of bettering themselves), depleting fossil fuel reserves (which increases the cost of oil which increases the cost of almost everything) and the early effects of climate change I think the time is coming when that safety blanket will be torn away.",0,1294830079,null,0,false,0,c1cfdn0,t3_f0gc2,t1_c1cfdn0,t1_c1cfcnc,1426688637,5,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,5

I don't know. Unlike the other people on the internet. 

I am assuming that whatever it is will require a serious change of lifestyle. 

The idea that technological solutions will come along to replace fossil fuels seems insane to me. Although I don't have the technological comprehension required to analyse the state of ""alternative"" energy sources, I don't see anything being done and the energy infrastructure of our civilisation won't be so easy to switch to a non-fossil fuel model, will it? 

If the peak oil scenario plays out in the next decade or so, oil prices rocketing and supplies diminish, I am afraid that hellish scenarios will manifest, famines, wars and unrest. 

I don't know what the solutions are but I want to see the general population acknowledging there is a problem that needs addressing. I realise it's not scientific, but among my circle of social and work-related interactions, I can't find anyone who takes these issues seriously or has any political awareness.

Loan valuation is a tricky business - it's fairly easy to do across a reasonable size of non-concentrated assets, but when you get unintended (and unknown) concentration risk, things can start to get bad. Of course, securitising the loans into CDO^n structures in theory helps spread that concentration into diversification, but at the cost of not fully understanding what is contained within a given portfolio. There are further risk mitigation strategies to take, such as investing in super-senior tranches of CDOs (which still fare well, to be honest - but are expensive and carry not much reward).

Put simply, banking is hard. Very hard, in fact. The 'value' of a loan (or set of loans, really) has got so many inputs, which constantly fluctuate, it is very hard to know at any point in time what your portfolio is worth.",0,1294835468,null,0,false,0,c1cficy,t3_f0t7p,t1_c1cficy,t1_c1cfhl9,1426688698,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

It's a little more complicated than that. The real failure is in the credit rating agencies. In the US the rules state that banks must get their credit rated and must be done by an official credit rating agency. However the CRAs were funded by fees from the banks. What happened is banks would, quite naturally, choose to use a CRA that gave them a better rating. By having a market in CRAs it created a situation where they had to give good ratings to get funding.

Later on this misrated credit was passed around on the global market and literally pumped false liquidity into it. The banks operated on the assumption that the ratings were correct.

The solution is to no longer have a market in CRAs. Do not make the regulators dependent on money from the regulated. It was a stupid idea and one that should be reversed.",0,1294835784,null,0,false,0,c1cfiow,t3_f0t7p,t1_c1cfiow,t1_c1cfgwz,1426688703,4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,4

One of the things I've brought in is to change the way this is done, so where previously a PC setup took a day now it takes the helpdesk people less than an hour to unbox a PC and have it on the desk ready to go. Same with software deployment, what used to require someone to wander over to a PC and install an application is just a case of remotely deploying a package to that machine. Using stuff like imaging and remote deployment of software what used to take 1 person being tied up for a day, and having to wander all over a building can now be automated by someone working in another country. The result is when we lost one guy from out team, he was never replaced as most of what he did was automated away. If the police aren't using this type of technology, which is commercial available and relatively cheap to deploy then it points to a bigger problem with the way they are running the backend services.

It is horrible to lose your job, there is no doubt about that. But we need to seperate out this emotion from the actual impact on services. A lot of the way things are done in the backend can be modernized, especially in IT and telecoms, and as a result what used to require a multi-level team can be centralized to one location and done by far less people.

I agree with you :P, I am afraid that hellish scenarios will manifest, famines, wars and unrest.

But I disagree that technological solutions are insane. Indeed they are our _only_ hope. Energy consumption is increasing generally as indeed it should do and due to the well-documented [Jevons Paradox](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jevons_paradox) the idea that you can decrease usage through efficiency is on shaky ground, besides a lot the increased use is tied to living standards especially in the developing world so I don't really see how politics can help solve an essentially physical problem. 

If people have to choose between a political ideology of asceticism for the sake of the environment or higher living standards I believe they will always choose the latter. Especially when many things like Carbon Trading just seem like another way for financiers to screw over the ordinary man.

What is insane is to believe that technological solutions will just come along out of nowhere without the research funding and national priority they need. We need something like the Manhattan Project or the Apollo Programme to solve the energy crisis.

Sadly I agree that many people are unaware but they will become more aware as fuel prices rise increasing the costs of many other goods such as food etc. I just hope the awareness doesn't come too late.

seems to me to be causing another problem.

I'd like to see a more efficient use of public money, but I don't think we are seeing smart decisions being made by anyone. The problem I see with the efficiency argument is precisely the human cost, which is a cost rarely included in the figures. I see the efficiency argument all the time from IT types (not knocking them, I am sort of in IT myself). I have seen departments where the antiquated procedures require 15 low skill workers (mostly in their 50s), and I know it could be done by maybe 4 skilled people. But I don't see the advantage in sacking 15 people who may never work again. Now, of course, people with harder hearts than me will probably sack them, but to be honest I don't see the 4 skilled workers coming in, it'll just be fewer people trying to keep up using the same old system.

I know that my example above pretty much makes the case for the cuts in itself, my only response is that focussing on limited areas in which quick cash savings can be made is a short term solution to a problem which requires a more holistic approach, which does not necessarily place efficiency and modernisation above the needs of ordinary working people. Sadly, even I know this is dreamland, but it'd be nice to have a better balance in these cuts, and a lot more forethought.

The argument could be made that if those workers were employed in the private sector for firms that made profits and contributed to the economy then we wouldn't be in this mess to begin with. I know there is a human cost to this, but we cannot just keep doing things because doing any different would put people out of a job, and this type of attitude is why we are seeing yearly increases in the cost of running the public sector which aren't matching up with yearly improvements in delivery of the service. This is unsustainable. 

This is just the cycle of boom and bust (which we were told had been ended), during the boom times you grow, and during the downturns you optimize. If we refuse to optimize then when things start picking up again (and they will) we won't be able to take advantage of that.

Another thing we desperately need to do is to work on re-skilling people, if you've worked for 20 years in one job and were made redundant because the processes you use were outdated and automation took away the need for the head count, then instead of being given week long seminars on how to write a CV you actually need to be provided with skills that are relevant to the current market conditions. You can write the best CV in the world, but if there is nothing to go on it then who cares? Ageism also needs to be tackled.

In short, the world we are in has changed dramatically in the last 50 years, and we have to keep up with it.

I don't think they are insane but it is insane to think they will appear out of nowhere, which is all we can hope for since there is little being done in research and implementation. 

Also, a reduction in living standards is not asceticism. We can reduce a lot without any suffering. I doubt people will accept this, which is cause for pessimism.

So what you are saying is, that it's ok to cause actions that could easily lead to death, as long as they don't. It's ok to drive into a crowd of pedestrians at 50mph as long as they get out of the way. It's ok to push someone off a cliff if they land in such a way that they don't get hurt - perhaps fall in the sea.

&gt;I think two years is a lot for a single moment of indiscretion where no one got hurt.

Well, if someone starts randomly shooting a gun in your direction then I guess you would not be cool with a harsh punishment as long as you don't get hit.

They've definitely improved. In the nineties I'd get stopped and searched all the time walking home from mates houses and pubs in the night. It was annoying, but they were polite, and would sometimes give me a lift.

I remember one time though there was a group of men who decided to go queer bashing outside one of the local gay pubs. When the police arrived they stood around and joked with these men, while a kid was on the floor being treated by the ambulance crew. Their was uproar, and it led to changes in policy round here. The police started treating hate crimes seriously, coming to gay bars and talking to people and putting up posters.

Still, there was resistance from the old guard who resented having to be politically correct. I remember one old pissed off duty copper losing his sunglasses and making a beeline for the only black man in the pub garden before his girlfriend found them and saved the black bloke from the harassment he was getting.

true,astley166,null,null,"I'm not sure it is fair to say that Labour have spent the last decade increasing the size of the public sector. In some areas yes, but look at public private partnerships (a labour policy to find new sources of income to build infrastructure). That was used to essentially make sure the Government looked prudent (before we all realised that they were delaying the inevitable expensive costs of getting private organisations to fund the building of a hospital). 

Anyway, to answer your question head on. My issue with how they are implementing political philosophy. It pretty much stems back to the OP's issue with honesty. I wouldn't have a problem with the Tories (i would with their policies) if they implemented their political philosophy stating that they just felt the Government should play a smaller role in our state structures.  In reality they are stating that this is all a bullet we need to bite because of Labour's poor economic policy (when the policy does not reflect this). Or they position themselves so that the Lib dems take the flack (I have no idea why they have agreed to be a flack jacket for the Tories).

While I would agree that this is not entirely privatisation of the NHS. It is a start as we end up taking decisions away from public run entities and in the hands of private contractors. This is why I refer to it as a backdoor rather than flat out privatisation. 

It would be impossible for the Conservatives to just simply ditch the NHS. But they can steadily privatise sections of it and argue that the market will mean we get the best results (when in reality this means massive overspends for simple medical problems, aka America). How far will they go? I could only speculate as to their long term plans.

TLDR: I state they privatise by the backdoor as it is not simply selling it off, its more about reducing the states's role within the NHS via privatisation of sections of the service. ",0,1294882587,null,0,false,0,c1ciqmh,t3_f0gc2,t1_c1ciqmh,t1_c1cg8hw,1426690220,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

You have 3 types of people who work in IT and as the levels go down, the numbers increase.

You have the engineers (like him) who know how stuff works inside out and have a high level of education. They design systems, build applications, solve problems. etc.

The next level down are smart but not engineers. They are technicians. You can give them a technical document and they can work out how it works but they will not design systems/code large applications (generally). They can solve some problems but not on the scale of engineers. They can pretty much operate on their own and manage their own time without much supervision.

Then at the bottom of the food chain, you have the monkeys. They dont know jack and usually fuck stuff up. They have to be watched because they eventually fuck up even the most simplest of instructions. They cannot solve problems at all. They usually create, or add to them.

The salary of each level is relative to their position on the food chain. That's why you will get a support team with 8 monkeys rather than 4 skilled workers.

Huh? Are you implying that all left-winger oppose Nuclear Power? This is far from the truth and [even one of the co-founders of Greenpeace now supports it.](http://www.wired.com/science/planetearth/news/2007/11/moore_qa).

I believe that Nuclear Power could be used a lot better if we reprocessed the waste rather than using once-through and researched alternative fuel cycles such as Thorium (but those reactors are a long way off) so reprocessing is the main thing. Furthermore the use of neutron sources to bombard and transmute the fissile material that is still produced might help reduce the waste lifetimes and there are some plans for hybrid fusion/fission systems using tokamaks as high energy neutron sources to achieve this.

The fact remains though that there is still only a finite amount of uranium that can be extracted with an EROEI &gt; 1. And that amount will be depleted at an extraordinary rate should be switch all baseload generation to nuclear and move to using electric or hybrid cars etc.

However I believe that pragmatically the best thing we can do is build nuclear plants (with waste reprocessing) for baseload power and use wind power (both offshore and onshore) for the rest. Building these new energy solutions will be expensive but now is a good time to do it as such public works could help ease us out of the 'bust' period by providing employment and business contracts to get the economy moving again whilst also solving a pressing issue.

More long-term I think we must invest far more in research and development of energy sources. We currently lead the world in fusion research at JET but its successor ITER is struggling in the current economic climate. 

Fusion power has come a _long_ way in sixty years despite what detractors may say. Indeed the fusion triple product, a measure of the reactors capability to generate power [has doubled every 1.8 years](http://www.efda.org/pictures_html/moores_law.jpg) outpacing even the astonishing advances made in transistor technology. 

Although the most common and advanced forms of nuclear fusion do produce some low-level waste due to irradiation of the reactor chamber it is nothing like the problems posed by fission reactors (it takes ~50 years to return to background levels, as opposed to the thousands of years for some of the worse fissile wastes). Furthermore, fusion power could generate more power than fission by orders of magnitude thus truly giving us an abundance of energy.

However, obviously we cannot build those reactors tomorrow which is why we must build fission reactors for baseload and wind/hydro for the rest (I doubt solar would work well in the relatively dim UK) whilst increasing R&amp;D spend to ensure we get there. 

The energy crisis is fundamentally a technical problem which requires a technical solution (I despise the minority of greens who seem to struggle with basic orders of magnitude calculations and think that the energy crisis could be solved if only we all rode bikes and wore jumpers). However, implementing such a solution requires political will - I only hope it is realised that the energy crisis is not a partisan issue before it is too late.

Right, where do I begin? At the beginning I suppose...

You're right, the government clearly does not represent any of our interests, but they damn well should do. When it comes to drugs I believe the problem to be a complete lack of proper education on the substances, and a scaremongering media which seem to go out of their way to print exaggerated bullshit stories on relatively harmless drugs. People are told at school, on the news, and in the papers that one ecstasy pill will probably kill you, not true. People need to be raised to respect these substances in the same way they should respect safe sex.
I am not afraid to admit that I am a massive clubber and have taken ecstasy tonnes of times, as well as most of my friends. I have never come close to dieing on ecstasy, neither have the hundreds of people I know who take it. Im not saying the drug is completely safe, if you take 20 good pills, then aye, you probably will keel over, but this is not the drugs fault, its the users own lack of respect and education on the drug. If someone drinks an entire pint of vodka in one go, and then dies, you dont blame the vodka for killing that person, you blame the person for being a complete fucking moron. The fact is that ecstasy is banned anyway and is almost impossible to get, so instead nowadays most clubbers resort ot GHB or MCat, and I can tell you from experience that MCat is NOT safe, it fucks with your head, it is addictive, is far far more dangerous than E, and only exists because people cant get their hands on E. Lack of proper education, and banning a safe drug, has led to people resorting to a far more dangerous substitute. The government will never stop people from wanting to lose themselves a bit after a hard weeks work, treating the people like children, telling us what we can and cant do, will only result in the people rebelling like children. Legalise these subtances, make and control them, then we know whats actually going into the drug, and the money can go towards out shitty economy. Sorry, bit of a rant, but my 2p worth nonetheless.

Again, as regards to Murdoch, you say that those who do know about it oppose it, but we are in the minority. Again the problem is a lack of general knowledge, and a complete of understanding on just how powerful the media can be in swaying peoples opinions. What is needed then is a better education, more people need to be told the truth, a bit of a catch 22 when many of these people gain their biased knowledge from a newspaper controlled by Murdoch et al.

Regarding the student fees, I am not at the age where this affects me. I went to the University of Aberdeen, and as a Scottish citizen, this education was free, and count myself amazingly lucky to have studied Sociology at one of the worlds leading sociology universities, without having to pay a single penny. My opinion on the tripling of student fees is not anger about having to pay 9k, but anger at having to pay any fee whatsoever. IMO, education should be as much as a human right as health care, running water and a roof over ones head, even £3k per annum is way outside the grasp of most working class families, and any form of fee paid education only ever serves to distance the gap between the haves and the have-nots. I wonder how many poorer kids could have gone to uni this year if the bonuses had been capped, and any over-run gone towards paying for their education?

Magical sky-pixie believers are free to their rights to believe, that still doesnt mean they should be given more say than those who do not believe. The little interesting thought experiment has gone over in my head many a time: On day 1 of my installation as supreme commander of the new British republic, after stripping the royal family off all power, my first act would be to immediately relinquish power to the people. If absolute power does indeed corrupt absolutely, then I'd best get rid of it ASAP. 
I have my theories, and would be interested on how you think they may or may not work, or how to be implemented, but here it is in very basic form. As I believe a small group of a few hundred people can never truly represent the wishes of 60 million citizens, the people themselves should decide and regulate on laws. How about a system where there is an internet ready computer in ever household and once a month it is a citizens legal duty to log on, check that months laws and make a vote? There was a website up last year after the election where the government asked for the public to log on and make recommendations and votes on what laws they wanted to see passed in this country (cant remember the name of the site now, lost the link after a recent format - my memory sucks). Do you think a system like this could work on a much larger scale? I think with a system of every person voting on laws we could return to a form of proper democracy not seen since the ancient Greeks. Of course not every single person could vote, restrictions would have to be put in place based on age and maybe even education, other might not even want to vote, but even if just half the population logged on monthly and voted on laws we would have a nation with a far more equal representation of the peoples wishes, and power would be rightly stripped from the handful of those who use it only for their own gains. We don't need governments to run the country, we can do this ourselves - Belgium will be interesting to watch in the next few months.

Another way of doing this could be something like /r/infograffiti? If you're not aware of reddits growing underground movement you should go have a wee look, it is a fantastic way of solving one of the aforementioned problems regarding peoples own lack of knowledge on subjects they really should be made aware off.

The only way it could be done, I think, would be to extend Ofcom's remit and bring the papers under the scrutiny of that existing regulator.  
Having Rupert Murdoch lurking on the fringe of the Conservative Party doesn't help the cause for tighter regulation of the media much either.

At heart is the traditional relationship between the British Press and the government. This has usually been a mutually beneficial one where the papers are allowed to do pretty much whatever they like in return for offering their support for political parties, killing certain stories that could potentially damage the careers of key politicians and publishing government propaganda unquestioningly.

I would like to complain about the latest issue of ""Horny Wives"", specifically the model appearing of page 17. After careful checking, it would appear she was not wearing a wedding ring and thus I do not believe she was a wife. While I appreciate the tag line ""totally nude"", that does not usually extend to jewellery, and if in this case it does I feel her finger and toe nail varnish would fall into a similar vein. 

Further, I have failed to find a single horn on any of the women depicted. I performed a thorough audit of the latest issue, and upon noticing the error have gone back over the past sixteen. The only time when there was anything which could be described as a ""horn"" on any of the women was in the ahlloween issue when one model was wearing a plastic set of devil horns.

Anyway this bird started hanging around with my crowd ( a group of 40-50 people who went everywhere and did everything together, including some pretty heavy drug dealing ) she kinda appeared out of nowhere and was very cute ( probably 25 or so )  she didn't dress the part but that changed as she got to know us. She hung around, went to the parties, went to the raves, went to the gigs, she never did drugs but was always there when we were doing them ( and picking them up ) she basically lived our life. We got quite close, she ended up being my girlfriend for a while and I must say I was completely smitten with her. 

Anyway... one night she came out with us and took a pill ( she'd never done one before, no idea why she decided to do it on this particular night ) It kicked in and she danced her socks off having the time of her life ( strong shit, Cally Whites ) anyway she disappeared into a chill out room with a mate of mine for an hour or so, as you do.  

Cut to, my mate comes running out, grabs my arm, takes me into the toilets and he's like: Fuck me mate, your bird is an undercover copper. And I'm like: What? Yeah man she's an undercover copper, she just fessed up off her nut. 

And there you have it, the girl I'd been seeing was an undercover DS officer who'd been tasked to get a heads up on the ( pretty substantial ) drug dealings within our scene and within our group. 

I confronted her about it, I mean I was fucking angry, like really fucking angry and she ran out of the club crying. And... I never saw her again after that night, she just completely disappeared. 

Shame really, she was hot.

You stated that what happened to Ian Tomlinson was ""very, very rare"". I have shown that there is a pattern of these kinds of incidents going back at least 30 years.

&gt;*""And that almost all of those cases were fuckups as opposed to true brutality?*

Taking the incident of Ian Tomlinson as example, so what happened to him was ""a fuck up"". How is that so? The copper didn't mean to push him that hard? He only meant to really hurt him as opposed to killing him?

What happened to Ian Tomlinson was the penultimate consequence of a long day of police brutality exhibited through the G20 demo. You only have to do a youtube search for videos to see evidence of that.

[Using this video](http://www.komonews.com/news/local/112097619.html) as some sort of comparative for levels of brutality is a bit of a straw man really. For it to be comparable, you would have to arm every copper in the UK with sidearms and let it stew for a few years so the novelty wore off and then you would see comparable numbers of incidents (adjusted for population sizes, etc)

&gt;*The Mail article is their usual bullshit also. What if they shot 33 people? Nothing is said about any of those being controversial. And the anonymity of the shooter is a good thing IMHO.*

As I said, I felt dirty posting the Mail link but point was irrespective if you consider that those were justifiable homicide or not, it shows that we have a culture in this country where there is a lack of accountability with regards to police shootings. If we do it is all shrouded in secrecy where, for the benefit of everyone, it should be out in the open with complete transparency.

The anonymity of the shooter is not a good thing at all. A lack of transparency encourages the wrong thing. It creates a culture in teh minset of those armed officers that, chances are, they will not face any kind of prosecution, or liability for their actions. They do not consider culpability before taking fatal action.

The case of the ""*fuckwad banker with the shotgun shooting out his window*"", or Mark Saunders, was that he was contained, running out of steam and winding down. It didn't need to end as it did. Reflecting after the inquest, the Telegraph commented, [""the gross over-reaction to the situation (59 officers, 100 guns, 12 marksmen with rifles trained on Saunders), the quite shocking failures of communication and command, some of the macho evidence given, anonymously, by armed officers should all worry us deeply.""](http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/news/richardpreston/100057910/the-killing-by-police-of-mark-saunders-should-worry-us-as-much-as-the-menezes-disaster-if-not-more/). I'm quite inclined to agree. Even Met Commissioner, Sir Paul Stephenson was said to be [""furious"" that anyone could show such ""insensitivity and lack of judgment""](http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2010/nov/02/mark-saunders-song-titles) with regards to the armed officer who used song titles in his oral evidence.

&gt;*Not once did I say the police were perfect or fully accountable. I've worked in law (briefly) and I saw plenty of ""no further action"" in response to complaints in my time. But comparing them to e.g. the US or Italian police is insane. Shit, look at this video. Not even on the same page.*

The UK does not have a level of transparency regarding police cameras filming incidents. Any kind of incident where CCTV may well have captured it, seems to disappear, or the cameras had ""technical faults"". We do not yet have cameras in every police car that has to be released as part of FOIA. Instead we have shitty TV shows with completely sanitised footage being shown on shitty cable channels, reinforcing the mindset that coppers are alright really.

I mostly agree, but there may be a link between your memory may being a sieve and the substances you've ingested over time. Heck, I have my username for a reason! I think your rant is mostly well deserved, to make a counterpoint (playing devils advocate more than anything else), if people can't be trusted to treat alcohol responsibly, what happens when we open the floodgates to everything else?

&gt; *Murdoch*

No disagreement here. It's the same with Berlusconi in Italy.

&gt; *Student fees*

I think we have to disagree here. I agree with funding everyone's education up to a point (the point being where they can start work). On the other hand I'm not sure we should give everyone degree funding. If you let everyone apply for degrees for free, you'll end up with a vastly oversubscribed academic sector full of shit degrees that appeal to the lowest common denominator with no hope of a job at the end. On the other hand a degree is one of the best things a poor person can have to get out of the poverty trap (but if it becomes a common thing, then it may lose it's appeal). If you'll hear me out, how about this:

Instead of just doing student loans, we create a national academic funding pool. This pool funds university places for the brightest people on a means tested basis. That is to say that if you're poor, and you did well enough to get into university, then your first attempt at a degree is 90-100% funded based upon how poor you and your family are. The funding drops off based on how much money you and your family have down to zero. The factors affecting funding (in no particular order) - benefits claimed by family (e.g. housing, unemployment, tax credits etc.), homes owned by family, cars insured for use by family (as some people get company cars so they don't own them) and so on.

What do you think? Would it work? I don't mind funding someone's degree if it helps them out of poverty, but I don't like the idea of funding some trust fund rah boy's Oxbridge pissaround who has family who could've paid it themselves.

&gt; *thought experiment*

An interesting idea, perhaps the swiss cantonal system might work better for you? That has a highly devolved series of local governments. As for your website, I look forward to manipulating the results. As for the Internet ready computer in every house - put it in the voting station or the library.

We clearly displayed her ring, whilst the horn must have been obscured in adulterated copies by Muslims wishing to cover up the conspiracy against Princess Diana. A full explanation will appear in the Express on pages 1,2,5,6,7,8,29 to 34, and in the sports section. No Mary Millington's were involved.

We can end the private monopolisation of the Earth's resources, making them the common property of society. Then we can adopt a planned economy and centralise the distribution of goods, providing all people with an abundant, equal income with which to purchase the goods they require from society. We can automate the vast majority of menial labour so that people are freed from pointless lives, and the benefits are shared amongst all, rather than the current system of unemployment and poverty for the unfortunate and overwork for the ""lucky"" ones.

Then we can do things according to need, rather than just profit. We could invest a huge amount of resources in to Nuclear Fusion research and graphene-based photovoltaic cells for instance, to ensure that the abundance of goods and automation we currently experience will be sustainable. Whereas at the moment these projects often go underfunded due to the myopic profit motive.

This system of inequality isn't necessary, as with automation we can finally build Athens without the slaves. We can produce what we need in abundance and end the effective servitude created by the inequality, which condemns people to waste their lives in menial labour simply because it is cheaper than automating it. Putting an end to the current economic anarchy would also provide ways to invest in the important scientific research of the future and help to stop the short-sighted environmental damage that currently goes on, as each individual is only concerned with their own profit.

true,Swany,scottish,,"Hmmm, Im sort of with you on the student funds but I think I still prefer the Scottish system, up until a few years ago we had student loans which were then scrapped in favour of grants, whereas loans will eventually have to paid back, grants do not. As much as I'm with you on the sore point of funding the education of a rah boy, I still think in the interests of fairness education should be free for all. However of course students still need to live, pay rent, buy food, fund their drug addiction etc., which is where the grant comes in. In Scotland the grants are means tested with the amount you receive being based on your own and your family's income, with the wealthiest students being entitled to no grant whatsoever.

As for watering down the importance of a degree, again Im with you, but then this would only happen if everyone was qualified enough to gain access to uni, which clearly shouldnt be the case if you fucked around at school and left with a B and a scar. One of the main problems here is not universities accepting too many students, but universities with bullshit pointless degrees who accept students, e.g. whatever Uni it is that is currently offering degrees in David Beckham and other such nonsense. :/


In the end I think the website (which I still cant remember the name of) was indeed taken down due to hackers swaying votes, so obviously security would be a massive issue, but I think would be worth the hassle. As for idiots voting, again Im with you, I had this argument with my friends mother last year before the elections, she told me she didnt see the point in voting since ""how can just one vote make a difference?"" The next day she talked about how long she'd spent on the phone voting on x-factor. The urge to bounce her fat head off the wall was almost uncontrollable, but this is the world we live in, people need to learn that one vote is not pointless, and to STFU about bloody x-factor.

There are many, many nurses in the UK. There are many nurses in training, and it's a position that many aspire to. When there is a large supply of something, but a fixed demand, the price drops. The three ways to stop that price from dropping are to impose a tax (in which case, the nurse gets less anyway), to subsidise the role (and since it's the Government paying, it would have to be an external influence), or to reduce the supply of nurses.

""Take a real terms pay cut or lose your job"" is a direct result of the above.

Of course, that's the 50,000ft view, when you're face to face with a family member/friend who is a nurse, they see it a *little* more personally!

The idea that we are inherently incapable of working together is just an excuse used by those who hoard great wealth under the current system. I think the very fact we are aware of the problems of selfishness and the availability of alternative systems, means we can overcome these problems.

As experimental psychology has shown (the Milgram experiment, the Stanford prison experiment, etc.), what we consider to be our ""core"" behaviour can be changed very quickly, especially with social pressures. I see no reason to believe, particularly with such blind certainty, that the selfishness we see cannot be overcome. Fundamentally we currently have a system where selfishness is rewarded, if it is modified such that altruism is rewarded and selfishness looked down upon, through education based around the principle that our lives are short and so our legacy is more important than our material gains rather than the acquisitive success that is encouraged at the moment, then I don't think it would present such an obstacle.

true,Ivashkin,null,null,"The difference we have is that while you see our humanity as something our society and way of living holds back, I see it as something which is held together by society and way of living. There are countless examples of places where society has fallen apart, and as a result the people in the middle of it have done things they would have never dreamed of before. Iraq is an example, before the war it was a poor, but peaceful place. But by 2007 sectarian murders were raging across the country, especially in places where Sunni and Shia populations were in close proximity. 

As for the Stanford and Milgram experiments, I don't agree with your interpretation of events, and I find they worrying on 2 points. Firstly, those experiments showed that once we had enough of a reason to ignore the moral framework our lives are constructed in we did not become better people. We became worse, and found ways of justifying things we would normally find unspeakable. Secondly, your treating people like things. You talk of quickly changing our core behaviour, modifying the way people think. Without a massive social engineering project this won't be possible. Especially without negative reinforcement of the desired traits. It's also a case that we don't actually know how to achieve what you want, so we would have to conduct long term experiments on people in order to discover what worked, and what lead to unintended side effects and collateral damage. Humans are hard wired to be tribal, to mistrust people who aren't tribe members and to horde resources, and you can't change that. You need to slowly change the way we live and the language we use. 

In part, the big society ideas are a step towards this. Reliance on the state to fix problems allows people to ignore them on an individual level. My gf sees this in her social housing job all the time, demands to be moved to a different property if they don't get on with their neighbours (as in they aren't talking, not ASB), because they can't get TV or cell phone reception, because their garden is over run, really minor issues they could resolve or at least deal with, without the involvement on the HA (which is essentially an outsourced extension of the state). 

So in short, don't look to huge, sudden, invasive changes in the way that we think, look to being the change you want to see in the world. The answer is not revolution (which almost always ends up with the glorious revolutionary leader becoming the same as the people he replaced), it's lots of small changes done on the individual scale that will make for a better tomorrow .

I also pushed for discussion of the way how the prosecution was (imho intentionally) broken. Again, I **never ever** said they were perfect. In terms of intent, I don't think the officer in question even intended on pushing him over. The problem there was not that officer, it was this official policy of harassment and kettlement that was to blame. Don't focus on this one cop (though he should probably be sacked), if you want to make a difference *change policy*. The current situation of adversity between the police and protesters *will* lead to more and probably worse events to come. Part of me suspects this is fully intentional as it effectively neuters discussion on the protest itself by creating distractions. There are numerous documented cases of the authorities [deliberately provoking violence via undercover agents](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agent_provocateur#By_country). 

Citing situations from the 70s is not valid. Back then it was socially acceptable to lock up people on charges of ""being black on a Saturday night"". Irishmen were routinely fitted up for crimes.

In fact, I recall being shot down in flames in many discussions where I tried to point out that he was a patsy to appease international relations. 

&gt; The anonymity of the shooter is not a good thing at all. A lack of transparency encourages the wrong thing.

The name of the shooter is completely irrelevant to any checks and balances provided by investigations etc. If there was controversy on the shot itself (e.g. done without direct order) then it would be applicable to look at their past record. But printing their name in the media serves no proper purpose whatsoever. 

&gt; Mark Saunders, was that he was contained, running out of steam and winding down.

Fuck him, he was leaning out of a window shooting at civilians. He was also shooting *into* his neighbours houses. I don't care if he was getting tired after a several hour seige, they should have put a bullet in his face the moment the team was in position. Selfish pricks like that deserve no second chance. If he killed someone he'd have said ""sorry, didn't actually mean to kill them, my bad"". 

I say this as a strong advocate of non-violence and gun-control. He crossed an unambiguous moral line and paid for it. Tough tittie. 

BTW, there was a similar situation about 3-4 months ago [just a mile from my flat](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-glasgow-west-11259019). However, the besieger did not have a firearm. He was taken alive. Go back five years and [there was another one](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/4226900.stm), again with no firearms. Again, the perp was taken without harm. IMHO this is what is meant by ""proportional response"". Had the cops shot these guys then I'd be in full agreement with you. But Mark Saunders was a wanker with a real gun shooting at his neighbours. Fuck him *and* the  family that raised that selfish prick. 

&gt; Reflecting after the inquest, the Telegraph commented, ""the gross over-reaction to the situation

Heh, makes a change from them complaining about an ""inadequate"" response, which *would* have been the case had some civilian died, despite the numbers. The press is a fickle beast. 

&gt; Sir Paul Stephenson was said to be ""furious"" that anyone could show such ""insensitivity and lack of judgment"" with regards to the armed officer who used song titles in his oral evidence.

I've done the same thing myself, but obviously not in a court setting. I've also played buzzword bingo. Deeply inappropriate in this case, but in all honesty I did chuckle a little on the inside. However, this isn't really relevant to the discussion at hand. 
 
Mark Saunders can suck a dick for all I care. He forgoed his rights when *he tried to take the right of life away from others*. The only difference between him and Raul Moat was the level of success. No one shed any tears when Gazza's own tears failed to fix that situation. Are we to feel sorry for the guy because he wasn't very good at the whole ""shooting people"" game? Only a muppet would attempt to use a shotgun as a medium to long range weapon.  

Also, I've seen discussion on the idea that it was a ""suicide by cop"" situation, where his behaviour was deliberately chosen to dictate such an ending due to his emotional issues. 

&gt; Instead we have shitty TV shows with completely sanitised footage being shown on shitty cable channels

Actually, it's worse than that imho, these shows are essentially government propaganda telling us to behave via moral messages, it's like a state version of an xmas pantomime. The criminal *never* gets away and right always triumphs over wrong. I'm almost certain that agreements to ensure this kind of editorial slant are signed prior to the release of footage.

A friend of mine is working on a short film where he is taking the excited voice over from these shows on top of real police brutality. Thing is mate, I think we agree more than we disagree, my core point is ""it's nowhere as bad as you make out"". The footing in my mates thing is almost entirely American. If you know of any good UK footage (beyond Tomlinson, that's in already) then I'm sure my mate would love to know about it. 

&gt; Just because you do not see it, does not mean it does not happen. 

As I said, I once worked a clerical role as a summer job for a lawyer.  I've seen plenty of rejected police complaints. Lots of people fell down stairs. However, those same people had long rap sheets for unprovoked violent assaults *and* they were intoxicated while arrested. Do the math. I never saw one where it wasn't obvious that the situation was created by the little scum suckers we had as our client base (East End of Glasgow, exclusively Legal Aid).

Fact is (recent protests excluded), if you are not aggressive to the police then they will not be aggressive to you. If you give them verbal they will return it. This is the key difference between our cops and others elsewhere in the world. 

&gt; Any kind of incident where CCTV may well have captured it, seems to disappear, or the cameras had ""technical faults"".

This needs tackled e.g. with criminal charges for destroying evidence. That aspect of the case of Jean Charles de Menezes was disgraceful. It is not conceivable that two weeks after a bombing of underground stations there were other stations with broken cameras. If there genuinely were then it's criminal incompetence on behalf of the station management who need to be sacked. The family in this case seemed far too easily dissuaded, personally I'd be demanding specific details on the exact nature of the technical fault instead of simply dropping it. 

&gt; If the police in this country end up being fully armed, you will see the number of police shootings as you do in the US

I mean, it's not like everyone needs to hold hands and dance with flowers, it is just an economic and political change such that automation benefits all and production is practised according to need rather than profit. This idea that it's against human nature is bizarre since most people would benefit from the change, as they do not own the land and resources in the current system.

Whilst it is hard, I don't think it is impossible to make people receptive to such a change, I mean as already mentioned it is ultimately in their best interests. Already most people look at the great inequality in the world, the way we still struggle with homelessness and unemployment whilst some make billions, the way the private banks and multinational corporations effectively dictate the country, and see that it is wrong, it's just that the solutions aren't clear and they are smeared by those in power.

Also, I'd disagree with trying to paint morality on the experiments (especially the Milgram experiment) as really all they show is that social pressure and authority can dramatically change our behaviour. This can be oriented to good causes as well as bad, just as with all scientific discoveries.

In any case, I don't think such an approach to re-education is necessary (it also sounds like something from Brave New World :P). As already many people are aware of the problems in the world, they just don't know of solutions and don't think they can change anything.

How on earth can people move like that? In my experience it's been very hard for people (my mother) to find council housing at all.

I don't think revolution will always fail (take the French revolution for instance, it wasn't perfect but it did lead to a lot of positive reforms), but I agree that a social evolution is needed too. As much as I agree with being the change you wish to see, I don't think small changes will work, as small, individual changes will not solve the fundamental problems of overwork and unemployment.

true,Ivashkin,null,null,"The problem isn't the private sector and private ownership of assets, it's just that the balance has tipped to far towards those interests. Ideally you do want private enterprise and a people taking risks with their assets, as this form of chaos produces things like the internet and computers cheap enough for even poor people to afford (with a £50 computer and copy of Ubuntu you have enough kit to go online). While a socialist society could produce those things, it happens faster when people compete to make a better, cheaper or faster product that anyone else. We just need things like anti-competitive behaviour laws and regulation of the market to stop monopoly's and curb the excesses. The free market and capitalism is useful, but it's not the only thing you need.

So you can have all that, and you can have a welfare system, healthcare (doesn't have to be the NHS, Germany has private insurance along with some of the best healthcare on the planet, even if your poor). The problem we have now is that our system is stuck on keeping people alive, rather than becoming a safety net that helps you get back on your feet. And as you've often mentioned, automation has removed a lot of the necessity for manual labour. This doesn't mean people are free to do nothing, it means that people are free to do other things. Which is why everyone is far far better off than they were a century ago. Only issue is, it happened so fast that we're having issues keeping up with it, and people are having problems adapting. 

As for how to change the way people think, this requires a more educated population. Not just vocational skills, but a rounded approach that includes math, science, English, humanities and philosophy. Your right in saying if people understand how things work, then they can see more solutions. At the moment the discussion around the problems with the banking system is heavily colored by people not knowing enough about how finance works (which can be both good (lending money for a start-up, and bad (lending money to start-up it knows will fail, and then hedging against it).

But I am wary of trying to manipulate people to much. Mainly because we don't know how to do that successfully, and often a really good idea will fall on it's ass the second it makes contact with the people it is supposed to help. You see this is in a lot of socialist nations, where great ideas about making society less stratified, and more equal just end up with a corrupt government forcing people to do things that they don't want to, and which are making their lives worse. The milgram experiment shows this, because once you seperate people into groups (the People, and their Leaders), they start to loose contact with each other, and stop seeing each other as people, and in the case of the Leaders viewing the People, as a problem rather than the people they are supposed to help. So this is why I tend towards the idea of letting vaguely organized chaos reign within certain limits, rather than trying to organize the whole of society into your own personal vision for a better world. 

&gt; How on earth can people move like that? In my experience it's been very hard for people (my mother) to find council housing at all.

Most of the time they can't, but they expect to be able to. So it eats time dealing with them and explaining why (which can take some time), rather than saying ""don't be stupid, buy a mower and spend a weekend or 2 sorting it out"". Every now and again someone will complain to the local press and/or a councilperson, and management will fold like a cheap paperbag, thus kicking the rug out from under the housing officer. The worlds ""get off your ass and sort it out yourself"" could solve a lot of the issues she faces at work.

As for people being over worked and others being unemployed, this is a problem of not enough private enterprises. If your overworked you are going to find it hard to get another job, and if your unemployed the same applies. The only way it can be fixed is via encouraging the private sector to grow. Right now things are shitty, but they will get better. If you remember the great depression, and then look at how the world changed in the following 50 years you will be hopeful.

You might say that the profit motive is required for people to do work and research, but I don't really think this is the case, as Free Software partly shows, and ultimately we have to ask is a marginal improvement (if there even is one) worth the problems of economic instability, unemployment, and environmental damage that are also caused by the profit motive.

Technological progress has helped to make our lives better, but as automation is spreading to all sectors of the economy, the unemployment it produces is counteracting this, as it increases the supply of labour and so makes the competition for work even more fierce.

Socialism doesn't necessarily have to separate the leaders from the people, I agree with your point, but the whole point of Marxism was to stop this alienation. The idea of having a closed party is only a detail of implementation, one that I disagree with.

But even in boom times people don't really have the choice to just leave, as there are still problems with unemployment. Unemployment is persistent, and because it is profitable for the businesses there is not even any incentive to attempt to solve it. The recurrent recessions mean that the consolidation of businesses is inevitable and so many of the much touted benefits of the market system are lost anyway.

What I've seen (and mostly heard) of the Sixth however, I really like. Looking back at it from now, and bearing in mind the overall plan for his character, I think it's a really good concept, and the in a way, he's the most open of all the Doctors I've met, excepting maybe the Second. Most of the complaints against him (not counting the wardrobe, which I don't even think is that bad. It's not good by any means, but it fits the character, and it's amusing, especially the way BFA treat it) are that he's volatile and arrogant . Well as for the first, it's a defining characteristic of the Ninth Doctor, and the Sixth's arrogance is to a lesser extent I think than the Eleventh, and certainly the mess of Hubris that was the Tenth, though the elder incarnations are more subtle about it. 

Plus, I can't help but love his verbosity, especially alongside Evelyn.

true,AndorianBlues,k9,K-9,"Excluding those, it has to be Patrick Troughton. A bumbling fool on the outside, but actually a scheming mastermind. And the Doctor and Jamie were just hilarious together, like two big kids.

Of course, none of the Doctor are really bad or anything. Pertwee was very good as the Doctor as an almost *Avengers*-like action hero, with a wonderful over-the-top foe in the Master. And such a lovely fatherly relation with Jo Grant (both on- and off-screen, judging by the commentaries by Katy Manning). 

And of course, Bill Hartnell. He MADE the Doctor, and took his character very seriously. The First Doctor is never silly or camp, which was probably very important among the cheap sets and monsters. At the same time, Hartnell could be light-hearted or even a bit romantic (The Aztecs is a favorite). [Barbara and Ian's goodbye](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKPLqv0PaaQ) is a very moving moment (and, according to William Russell's commentaries, was very close to Hartnell's actual reaction to them leaving the show. Also, ""cinders in Spain!"").

Peter Davison, IMO, suffers a bit from bad scripts and a crowded Tardis. He's a bit more of an understated Doctor after the bombastic Fourth. He's intelligent and really wants to help everyone he can. Probably more than most Doctors, he wants to do everything right. 

The Sixth Doctor is actually very good. That outfit is horrific, he's perhaps a bit too unlikable at the start, but he really does get better in Trial of a Time-Lord and the audios. Colin Baker really deserved much more than he was given credit for, although I think he's being much more appreciated in recent years.

Sylvester McCoy's Doctor is a bit silly in his first season, but becomes this mysterious mastermind in his other two seasons. At times, we get dangerously close to discovering who or what the Doctor actually is (something that has rarely been explored even in modern Who). I really enjoy this era of Doctor Who and I think modern Doctor Who owes quite a bit to these last seasons of classic Who. Ace is probably the first companion that really gets her own story that is explored in more than one episode.

true,paralemptor,null,null,"Hi Brainburger, thanks for the good question. To start with I never said I hated the government, nor did I say as the other fellow suggested that I hated religion. I also never said I was committed to Jedi.

On to your question. 
There are 3 reasons I plan on putting myself as Jedi is because 1) they insist on asking it (and I'm legally bound to answer it), 2) I feel it represents as good as any other answer a response which does not deny a spiritual position, nor insist on a traditional definition of spiritual thought, and 3) because I take liberty in expressing a mockery to a question which is posed by a system which has no real regard for what I have to say - so ""putting the truth"" as you suggest is ineffectual, marginalised, and ignored.

Edit - as per your second question ""What harm is caused?"" - the harm caused by allowing the status quo mindset to continue on its murderous self destructive path is enough for me to speak as I see things, and not as others would expect me to do. I'm happy to act as an exemplar for other similar minded people in this respect.

I might suggest also a fourth reason which is that it allows me to enter into debate with others and make people more conscious of the question itself, which imho has more potency than any ridiculous hope I'd have of a census making a difference.

I liked the irony in your post - ( ""For Gods sake say so!"" ). I think people often see a disconnect between the interests of governments and religious ideals, and treat them as being mutually exclusive. In my humble opinion this is a real stumbling block - the belief in the benign function of government is as cultish as the belief in the benign function of a deity. They are infact one in the same. 

As a result, I laugh. 

Why take either seriously? I'm not trolling, just saying what I feel.

I've seen this attitude advanced a lot on reddit recently, and it really puzzles me.

Admittedly I don't subscribe to a right-wing ""forget education or prevention; punishment over all"" philosophy, but I think it's ludicrous to pretend that the chances of getting caught don't really affect someone's decision to break the law.

Now, on a motorway, with good visibility, would you drive at 80mph *past a police car?*

How about smoking a joint in front of a copper?

Why do criminals break into offices and residential properties and steal computers, but rarely break into *police stations* to do the same thing?

And, just to clear up any lingering confusion... you really *are* advocating that criminals prepared to drive above a certain speed should essentially just be let go?

Generally the public don't commit moral crimes because they don't need to or want to. Legal crimes are a different matter.

&gt; Why do criminals break into offices and residential properties and steal computers, but rarely break into police stations to do the same thing?

People who are already going to commit crimes naturally care about their likelihood of getting caught.

&gt; And, just to clear up any lingering confusion... you really are advocating that criminals prepared to drive above a certain speed should essentially just be let go?

I'm advocating that restraint be used. We had a pedestrian run down by a police car in a high speed chase last year. This death is worse than the crime. If it is on an empty highway nowhere near pedestrians, fair enough. In a pedestrianised area though no. Our enforcement must not be worse than the crime otherwise it is useless.

I think BBC sound engineers must have a fairly interesting job, there was a great post here about their sound effects division recently that was really ear-opening.

Maybe a lot of the over use in the past of particular tracks was due to licencing? I figure that must have changed as in your typical episode of a daytime show there are samples used throughout, which I wouldn't think would be the best use of the production budget?

Perhaps it works the other way and the artists will pay / give the music freely to the Beeb, but without attribution what is the benefit?

It's an interesting area, and I find it cool to get introduced to new music through it.

&gt;
&gt; This is half the problem here. None of us want to care for our own anymore, they become hindrance to our career / life / leisure and in turn only help to lend families becoming more fragmented. Is become the norm now to have someone else care for your family until they die.

Because if you have a job, your not going to be in the house for most of the day and very few people are in a position where they can quit a job to look after their parents, even if they are in a household where they and their partner work, especially if they have kids. There is also the issue of space, since it wasn't that long ago that Mr Hari was decrying people who have more rooms than they need in their houses (which you might want to have when your parent/s get to the point where they can't live on their own any more).

The only thing that will solve this is the baby boomers getting older. They are a generation that has changed every part of life as they have grown up, and when they start getting into homes then expect to see a lot more noise about this subject. The people in homes atm are the generation that doesn't like to make a fuss, but the boomers have spent their entire lives making a fuss about everything.
