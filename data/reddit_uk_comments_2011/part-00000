Longest time between cause of regeneration and actual regeneration yet?  Yet I rewatched End of Time a week ago, and found those goodbyes necessary and well done.  It was the end of an era, and the Doctor was saying goodbye to a lot of characters we'll likely never again see in Doctor Who.  It was partly that which made me tear up.  

Then the Doctor regenerated alone in the TARDIS, which was sad.  Tennant is one of my favorite Doctors, and I miss him in the show.  I remember thinking, a year ago, who's this new guy playing the Doctor?  He'll never live up to Tennant.  He'll just be silly.  Well, here I am a year later already accepting Smith as the Doctor, and placing him high on my list of favorite actors to play the role.

But yeah, what also made me cry was that it was the end of an era.  Davies was leaving the show, and Moffat was taking over.  It was bound to feel like a new show.",0,1293859928,null,0,false,0,c1b0x81,t3_eug29,t1_c1b0x81,t3_eug29,1426664817,19,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,19

*Silence in the Library/Forest of the Dead - My favorite Tennant story.

*Genesis of the Daleks - My favorite Dalek story

*The Pandorica Opens/The Big Bang - Steven Moffat has never written a bad episode, but this seasons finale was amazing. Everything I love about Doctor Who is in this story.

*The Empty Child/The Doctor Dances - Favorite Eccleston story

*Caves of Androzani - Favorite Davison story

*Robot - Very simple, but incredibly fun Tom Baker story.

Here was a story about two famous gays adopting, so lets find a fundamentalist extremist christian to comment on it!

I remember reading Dan Hannan (an extreme right Tory euro MP) saying he regularly gets calls from the BBC on controversial news stories. ""Mr Hannan, don't you want to come on and say something really right wing/racist/discriminatory?"". When he often says, no, I agree with the story, or I disagree, but not for the controversial/racist reasons you were hoping for, he just gets an ""oh"", and then no-one calls him back to appear on the show.

Remember Nick Griffin's appearance on Question Time? Pretty much every ""question"" from the audience was an attack labelling him ""disgusting"", and he was cut short every time he talked by an aggressive Dimbleby who just labelled him a racist after every sentence. All true btw, Griffin is a disgraceful racist thug, but if you're going to invite him on the show he should be treated the same as every other panelist.

Believe it or not the BBC do this to support the stories they run, and discredit opposition. 

Take the Elton's baby story. Gay adoption, good, those saying it's bad are nutjobs like this guy!

The Dan Hannan invitations, ""we need some extreme right nutjob to look unreasonable and extreme in comparison"".

The Nick Griffin appearance, well, just organised character assassination of him and his party to re-enforce the view that the right wing are disgusting nutjobs.

I regard myself as centre-left btw, and having a few friends at the BBC they are the same, and according to them so is everyone else who works there.

I think it may therefore be a natural progression of having a predominantly centre-left workforce.

true,Prezbo,null,null,"&gt;I down voted you, then realised that just because I disagree with you shouldn't mean I give you a -1.

I presumed I would get downvoted - I'm the only dissenting voice.

&gt;Instead I will reiterate what otterdam has already said with this little hypothetical question. Compare two possible outcomes of this police investigation - one where Mr Jefferies is brought in front of a jury, who has seen the news coverage of this man and have heard about his private life as it is splashed around the news.

&gt;And the other outcome being where a man unknown to the public and the media is charged with Joanna Yeates murder, and is subsequently brought to trial

You seem to see the media as a bunch of vindictive arseholes who have presumed this guy is guilty. I don't think that's fair.

All the journalists are doing is trying to find out a little about the guy who has been arrested.

If someone else was arrested they would try and find out about him/her.

The only way your hypothetical question works is if the other person arrested was brought to trial instantly.

This would mean the press wouldn't be able to write about him/her because it would be contempt of court, but it would also be highly unlikely to happen.

I also think you have a condescending view of jurors, as though they would instantly presume he is guilty because his picture has been on the front page of newspapers.

It is also unlikely that the whole case against this man is going to revolve around what has been in the media - his job, his interests and what the neighbours think of him.

What is much more likely is that the police will have actual evidence against him - DNA, witness statements, etc, etc. The papers haven't printed any of this! (Because they're not allowed to print evidence.)

I would imagine what the papers have printed and what the barristers tell the jury will be two completely different things.

&gt;...I think it should be explored by all who think Mr Jefferies is fair game. He is not.

There should absolutely be a presumption of innocence, but I think the idea that nothing should be written about him is wrong.

I think it is fine to investigate the man who has been arrested for the most notorious murder in Britain at the moment, as long as it doesn't influence a future trial.

The report the OP linked us to is fair and will not influence a future jury.

As I've said before, it certain is not ""gutter trash"" journalism or ""idle speculation"".

Just to delve into that last point a bit deeper: Where is the ""speculation"" in this report? It offers absolutely no opinion, it just states a few facts the journalist has managed to uncover.

And the idea that it's ""idle"" is, frankly, libelous. 

This is an impressively researched piece, especially considering it was probably written in a day and few people would have wanted to talk to the journalist. 

Also, a team of editors - and possibly a lawyer or team of lawyers - would have gone over ever phrase in fine detail to make sure it would not prejudice a potential future trial.",0,1293897501,null,0,true,0,c1b1s53,t3_eu60q,t1_c1b1s53,t1_c1b01y0,1426665217,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

You could start [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Media_influence) though.


Anyway, we should probably put the case in some more context:

1. A man has been arrested in connection with a murder
2. The natural question that follows is 'did that man murder her?'

All the information revealed by the press has come of a direct consequence of (1), and that information is framed by (2) since that is, after all, why people are interested. If I told you a man played a violent video game you probably wouldn't think anything of it. If it was a man up for murder, you might place more weight on it.

Now (in this country at least) a fair trial is conducted solely on evidence provided in the trial. This is why previous convictions are not given in the trial.
The problem with media influence is that they may reveal information prior to a trial in such a way that it influences the jury. When that information is inadmissable as evidence, the jury has been compromised and a fair trial is not possible.

Of course it is difficult to ascertain whether the media is doing this right now, but you have to be cautious since you can't put the cat back in the bag. And there is a very real possibility of it happening:

I really hope Villas-Boas gets the job. He has excellent credentials and is currently unbeaten as a top-level manager (exceeding Mourinho's record at Porto). He is a young new-generation style of manager - not a former player but an educated and well-taught manager. He learnt under the best - Bobby Robson and as Mourinho's assistant for 4 years. I like his style and I like bringing in somebody young who can work with the new style of football management.

It isn't worth firing Hodgson unless we get somebody of his calibre - and we shouldn't let Hodgson go until we are assured that we can get somebody like that in the summer. 

He will be our Mourinho, and along with 4-5 signings (young European players) and a return to a good flowing, passing style of attacking football, Liverpool will be setup for the next 5-6 years.

We need that type of long-term thinking - not more short-term fixes in the hope of moving up a few places.

true,severedfragile,lfc68,,"Klopp is top of the Bundesliga, he's not going to be giving up that job except under extraordinary circumstances. Deschamps has distanced himself from the job. Hiddink is even older than Roy, FSG are going to go with a long-term replacement. Rangnick has hardly had a distinguished career as a head coach. Dalglish and Rafa represent steps backward for the club, we're not going to re-appoint the guy who was just fired and Dalglish is at best going to be caretaker until a permanent replacement can come in at the end of the season.

There aren't that many realistic options to get excited about. **Rijkaard** wouldn't be a bad option; hardly an extraordinary manager but he could do a good job. I've heard **Pellegrini** mentioned and I'd be happy with him, although he doesn't have too many managerial years left. **Boas** looks good, but it's hard to say what his ambitions are. **Martin O'Neil** is another who could do a good job, but has a reputation of being hard to work with (and may still fancy himself for the Man Utd job at some point). [**Edit** Thinking about it, he probably wouldn't work with Comolli, so that's out. I don't know if FSG are going to go with somebody that abrasive anyway.]

I've made no secret of my admiration for **Unai Emery**, who I believe is one of the best young managers around (and is also [pretty damn cool](http://i.imgur.com/9ma2l.jpg)] but he's also put a lot of work in at Valencia, so depending on the situation there, he's going to be hard to attract. If we can make him a deal, though, he's the guy to get. Great defensive organization, good reader of the game, can get the best out of temperamental players, aggressive in interviews, plays good football when possible (but grinds out wins when it isn't), works well with young players and is only 39 himself. I would love to see him at Anfield. Another option, far less glamorous but fairly realistic, is **Roberto Di Matteo**. Unproven when it comes to a club of Liverpool's ambitions, but he's another young manager who plays good football and is a pretty classy guy. His defensive organization still needs work though, and FSG might see takign a risk on him as being too similar to the club hiring Hodgson.

you want to change society... the spartans had homosexuality written into their constitution. it wasnt just nurtured, it was expected and written into law. obviously homosexuality was rife. why would homosexuality die out in a society that not only accepted it, but demanded it. was it not a natural aversion that again pushed homosexuality out of mainstream society ?

the spartan social model also brings into question another issue. that when conditioned people will not only openly accept, but also engage in homosexuality. the argument from the pro-gay crowd used to be that its not a choice, it is just the way they were made. is that the way you would like modern society to progress ? then as you say ""I would discriminate in daily life against those who don't completely accept homosexuality""

The 'War on Terror' is an excuse, and nothing more. I fucking hate what we are becoming, and I am genuinely scared for what the future holds for us.

We have been freer than ever before in the later half of the last century, but that has been changing this last decade, and changing fast, and I can see no end to it.

Those in power have seen what they can get away with under the banner of this false-flag 'war', and they approve wholeheartedly. We are not as far down that road as the US is yet, but we are not far behind them, and we will continue to follow their every single jack-booted step.

I recommend watching Children of Men if you want a damn good idea of where we are heading as a country over the next twenty-or-so years (minus the whole no-more-children thing, obviously).

Also, in ""Vincent and the Doctor,"" the mirror-thingy in the TARDIS scanned him, and printed an image of the First Doctor first, then the Second after that, which seems to indicate that Hartnell was, in fact, the *first* Doctor.

Now I know those who don't smoke will be up in arms about that statement, but it's true, there's still a lot of us who do and having a pint and a cigarette has always traditionally gone together in a pub environment, we've had half of that removed and it's killed the atmosphere stone dead. 

Whereas once I'd have happily sat all afternoon down my local on a Sunday, having a bit of lunch, a few pints, some great conversation, now you're having to go outside every 20mins so you're not really relaxing and to top it off our pubs seem to have been invaded by families and kids, they've effectively become Sunday Creches. Now I don't know about you, but I don't really want kids running around crying and screaming when I'm trying to relax, wasn't that the whole point of a pub in the first place, somewhere for the average man to get away from his family now and again?

No shit. I mean the wikileaks thing is all well and good, but to be honest it's giving governments a damn good excuse to start shutting down dissenting voices and the parts of the net those voices occupy, like for example, this place. 

You bring up such a strong concern as national security and it won't take long for some political spin doctor to pin a terrorist angle on it to justify web censorship. One could also argue ( as conspiracy theorist as it may sound ) maybe wikileaks actually exist for this purpose in the first place? It wouldn't take a genius to fool us and the material wikileaks releases is pretty much what we know anyway. It's definitely something that's crossed my mind a few times.

Well, the trick is to add some things to your comment that people agree with. If I'd only bad-talked Amy, said people are blinded by her beauty to a degree that they overlook all of her bad qualities, that it's against the Doctor's nature to have her as a companion, that she's implicitly an unlikeable character because she's trying to cheat with him on her wedding night and constantly making advances on him even on her wedding day in front of Rory, etc. then I'd have a -100 point comment right now.

As for pubs closing, I think its competition from other forms of entertainment that is having a bigger impact. It was within living memory that your entire choice of home entertainment was basically 3 TV channels, the radio, the cinema or the few albums you might have had. Today, you have an unending stream of 24/7 digital entertainment in the form of hundreds of TV channels, DVD collections, the internet and everything that has, computer games etc. People are drinking less as it is, and pub prices aren't cheap (£3 for a bottle of beer vs 4x the same bottles for £5). So while the idea of going to the pub often to drink might have been popular once, today people don't drink as often and have far more to occupy their lives with aside from going to a pub.

When I was a student I used to go to pubs more, but as I've gotten older they don't hold the same attraction. There are still nice pubs but often they are more bars than pubs these days. Most pubs are just shitty places with over priced drinks, booming music and nothing that makes them interesting. In my town atm there is a really nice bar, serves great cocktails but at around 2100 they turn the music up so loud you can't hear someone across the table talk to you. Why would I want to spend an evening shouting ""WHAT?"" to someone 1m away? And they all do it. It's a waste of an evening and just encourages you to drink yourself into a hole by 2300.

As your boyfriend already has a pump he will almost certainly get a prescription (for free) and all the consumables that he needs, however they don't 'have' to give you it. So basically he should go and see his GP as soon as possible to check, but in reality its unlikely that any GP would change his treatment assuming that what he's doing at the moment is working fine so he shouldn't expect to have any problems.

I genuinely wish they would raise it FURTHER. Maybe 25%. Why? Because even though the figure ""20%"" sounds like a lot, as shown in that news report, it's just 20p extra on £10. Yes, it's more when you get into thousands, but it's still relative.

With transport, health and other public services always in need of regeneration, I genuinely believe that the public should understand that in order for these things to get better, we have to fund them. And funding is done through taxes. If everyone gets taxed just a little bit more, then the community as a whole benefits more than the average person will lose out.

People complain about rises in taxes all of the time, but people also complain about bad public services. You cannot have the best of both worlds. You either have to pay up and enjoy better services or shut up and live with what you've got and if you do the latter, the UK will stagnate.

TRANSCRIPT if the site prompted you to log in:

BT is starting to sell a new service that is likely to prove controversial because it gives broadband providers the tools to create a two-tier internet, where some video content would reach consumers in a better condition than other material.

The service devised by BT’s wholesale unit gives broadband providers the opportunity to charge content owners for high quality distribution of their video products to consumers.

BT is seeking to capitalise on the fast-growing volume of video being downloaded over fixed-line and mobile infrastructure, led by services such as Google’s YouTube and the BBC’s iPlayer.

A new content distribution network built by BT should ensure that bandwidth-hungry video can be streamed to consumers without interruption, even at peak web usage times.

BT is starting to give its retail unit, and other telecoms companies, the chance to use the network by selling a wholesale service called Content Connect. BT Retail is using Content Connect to supply the company’s television customers with the BBC iPlayer.

The Open Rights Group, a consumer campaigns organisation, expressed concern that BT’s content distribution network could clash with the principle of net neutrality, or the idea that all web traffic should be treated equally.

Sally Davis, head of BT Wholesale, rejected suggestions BT’s new network would result in a two-tier internet where smaller content owners could not afford to pay broadband providers for high quality delivery of their material.

She said all broadband providers were increasing their download speeds, so the quality of the basic, “over-the-top” internet experience was improving.

Ms Davis said broadband providers using BT’s network may be able to give their customers the option to make an on-demand payment for watching a live event such as football. The payment would be in addition to charges associated with watching premium content like live premiership football.

Broadband providers were showing “considerable” interest in the new network, she said.

By relying on BT’s network, Ms Davis said broadband providers should be able to reduce their costs partly by cutting spending on “backhaul” connections between telephone exchanges and their core infrastructure.

BT’s network operates by placing servers relatively close to homes and offices, so that data traffic travels short distances. It means video has a much better chance of reaching consumers without interruption.

Jim Killock, executive director of the Open Rights Group, said: “BT’s plans have the potential to end up with a two-tier internet, with customers increasingly tied to bundled services [from broadband providers], and a reduction in competition across the open internet.”",0,1294121732,null,0,false,0,c1bcva2,t3_evupz,t1_c1bcva2,t3_evupz,1426670424,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

The point is that we get taxed when we earn money and we get taxed *again* when we spend money.  If you're paying the basic rate of tax (20%) then VAT potentially *doubles* your tax liability.  A basic taxation rate of 40% doesn't sound so good, does it?  But if they split it 20/20 then it's much easier for politicians to blather on about how they keep income tax low.

If you're paying the higher rate of 40% income tax then the government are potentially take 60% of everything you earn in taxation.  70% when your earnings go above £150k (perhaps this figure was chosen because the Prime Minister's salary is something like £146k, if memory serves).

Then we have National Insurance contributions which can be anything up to 13.8% of your earnings, plus the contribution that your employer makes.

And if you're running your own business (like me), then you also have the 20% corporation tax to think about (27% when your company profit goes above £300k).

I'm not against high taxation in principle if the money is paying to improve our society.  But instead it's being squandered on oil wars and bailing out banks so that they can continue to pay themselves ridiculous
bonuses.  Oh, and paying the interest on the debt that the last set on monkeys got us all into.

We're getting shafted with high taxation from every angle.  The fact that it's only going up from something like 40% to 42% is neither here nor there.

&gt; You were already paying VAT and have done all your life.

No, I haven't paid VAT all my life.  It was introduced in 1973 and I'm just about old enough to pre-date that.  Imagine that.... there was a time when people didn't assume that it was OK for the government to charge them 20% for the privilege of doing private business.

No, the rest of us subsidise *all* single people, regardless of their earnings, the size of their property or how many rooms they have unoccupied.  

The reason is that one person takes up more or less the same space as two.  A single person still needs a bedroom, bathroom and kitchen of similar size to that required by a married couple.  So two people can share the cost of a small flat/house, but a single person can't downsize to a flat half the size because it just doesn't scale that way.  So it makes sense that single people should get a reduction.  

Sure, it's a bad thing that rich people get to live in large houses when there aren't enough houses for all the poor people.  But that's the way the world works.

So, is a Jaffa Cake a biscuit or a cake? There was a very interesting, and hilarious court case over it. 

-----

Jaffa Cakes, cake, biscuit or something else? Why should Jaffa Cakes be named as they are? Well Jaffa comes from Jaffa Oranges, which are named after the Israeli city of Jaffa. But then why should they be called Jaffa Cakes when they look so much like biscuits? In fact whether Jaffa Cakes are cakes, biscuits or something else has been the subject of much controversy in the United Kingdom.

Under UK law no value added tax (VAT) is placed on biscuits or cakes. But critical to the controversial issue of Jaffa Cakes’ name, when a biscuit is covered in chocolate it becomes subject to the standard VAT rate of 17.5%. Mcvities, the market leaders for Jaffa Cakes classed them as cakes, not biscuits, but this classification was challenged by Her Majesty’s Customs and Excise in 1991.

In the end the case ended up in the courts and the court were forced to answer the question of when something should be classed as a cake and when it should be classed as a biscuit. Answering this general question would then lead easily into a decision related to ‘Jaffa Cake, cake or biscuit?’

So what happened? Is a Jaffa Cake a cake? Happily for us Jaffa Cake lovers who would not relish the prospect of having to pay another 17.5% for our Jaffa Cakes, the court ruled in favour of Mcvities. One of the critical aspects of the argument was related to what happens when biscuits or cakes go stale. The court found, as anyone who has forgotten to put the lid on their biscuit tin properly will know, that when biscuits go stale they go softer. But when cakes go stale they go harder. The test was done, and when Jaffa cakes are left exposed to the air they get harder. So Jaffa cakes are definitely cakes and not biscuits. We recommend that you do the test to see for yourself, because unlike disgusting soggy biscuits, when Jaffa cakes go stale the new harder type of Jaffa cake you get is actually still delicious.

Just one more interesting Jaffa Cake fact all about their name: During the court battle between Mcvities and Her Majesty’s Customs and Excise, Mcvities baked a giant Jaffa Cake to prove that Jaffa cakes were really cakes and not biscuits.

No, it is implying that Gordon Brown did nothing to rein in the banks that are regulated by the UK Government. Perhaps if he had done so, we might not be in quite the same clusterfuck that we are today.

Let's say, using current measurements, you charge £3 for a pint. Now, for a glass that was 3/4ths of a pint, you could expect to pay £2.25 for that same amount using that ratio.

This example makes it look obvious, but any attempt to introduce this in this manner would be done very slyly - we'd be told it's for our own good - there's less units in these glasses so you could be told you can drink more glasses than you would with a pint, and 'one drink' would be pushed as healthier.

From reading the press release, it appears that they are going for the VoD market. Not YouTube.

&gt; Many media groups already use content delivery networks but in many cases these services only reach the edge of the ISP network, with the final stage delivered ‘over the top’ with no guarantees on the quality of service. The collaboration with Cisco helps ensure that BT’s next generation Content Connect platform can cache content deep in the broadband network and so deliver it much closer to the end user – avoiding congested areas of the network.  This, in turn, enables broadcasters to provide video content – and in the future live TV - with an assured level of service all the way to the viewer, providing uninterrupted access even at peak times. This provides broadcasters with the predictable user experience critical to supporting advertising or pay models.

If two services were running at the same bitrate (i.e. streaming services) with one on BT's content network, that doesn't make one of them faster.

The same is equally true for non-streaming services - if I can download from the BBC at line speed, and I can download from the BBC via BT at line speed, then it's not ""faster"" - but it might be better at dealing with demand.

I don't see why we should be holding back progress simply because some companies may choose to use this platform and some won't.

It would have been more mainstream, for a start (Alien was kinda groundbreaking in that it was a horror/scifi blockbuster with a strong female lead), and I doubt it would have actually had the long-lasting effect that it has had on our psyche.

Think of it this way. We've had **Alien** (lead female), **Aliens** (same lead female), **Alien 3** (same lead female), **Alien: Resurrection** (clone lead female). Now imagine the next possible sequel (ignoring the upcoming prequel for now) **Alien: Generations**, with the lead being a descendent of Ripley. Should it be Ripley's Grandaughter, or Grandson? Which would be better received by long-term fans?

I can just imagine the uproar if they cast a young male in the lead.

true,HeadphoneWarrior,lfc99,null,"Nope. Roy doesn't have a much better CV at all.

In fact, I'd argue that Laudrup, Rangnick et al are bolder, more tactically aware, better in the transfer market and just flat out more Liverpool material than the available English manager. Look at how ambitious and expansive Hoffenheim's game has been. Now look at Woy's Fulham. The players Rangnick found were better in my opinion, but then again, I watched barely half of one season of Hoffenheim.

Further, when I say we'd have to ""settle"" for one of them, I was being a bit sarcastic. It doesn't carry well in text I guess. But does anyone here doubt that Woy's neither as ambitious nor tactically aware as some of the names being tossed around since Rafa was exiled?

A manager who is ambitious, not afraid of a challenge, and moulds teams into feared opponents and irrepressible units. A manager who knows how to build a club from the bottom up. A manager who doesn't  play to the gallery. A manager who will not settle for second best.

We need a man who will remind us of Bill Shankly. Someone who invests his heart and soul, and drags the disbelievers with the believers, kicking and screaming to the top of the mountain once more.

If that is Woy, I will go kicking and screaming. If that is Rangnick or Laudrup, others will.

Further, I do not accept that a big name manager will be the one. They have their own agendas, image, ego and baggage to carry around. We really do need someone who is not a banner name, who will try to mould the club but not bend himself to The Liverpool Way. We need someone to augment it, and I'm not at all convinced that the way forward is getting a marquee manager, who is probably going to be closer to retirement than the beginning, is the right way to go.

They might even repeat this . All the time without looking at the big picture . I've seen a good CD &amp; DVD shop - FNAC in La Défense , Paris - do exactly that and basically remove any reason to go shop there . And that was after they tried to destroy themselves with a loyalty card scheme and high prices for anyone not on the scheme . It means that it is awfully difficult getting decent French , let alone German and Austrian , DVD's in France .

In Britain there is a good DVD shop near HMV in Cheltenham . Unfortunately I can't remember it's name and I did find a lot of bad service whenever I was there so stopped going there .

HMV in Torquay was reasonable . HMV in Cheltenham and in Poole - didn't have anything of interest .

Prices are always an issue . But so is availability of product .

""The idea that the Gulf Steam has slowed just simply isn’t true. I’ve been crossing the Gulf Stream since the early 80s in submarines and sailboats, both of which are slow craft, especially the sailboat. A sailboat only goes 5knts and one must make corrections for the Gulf Stream current. A 30% reduction is a substantial reduction and would result in errors of navigation and or changes in the correction used. You can review any navigational aids you wish, you will not find any that have changed the correction used for the Gulf Stream since the ’80s, that is, the 1880s. The science here isn’t science. Instead of using a bunch of college kids that know nothing of the sea, get US Navy records and records from actual sailors that cross all the time.

The US Navy has accurate temperature records taken at depths to 1000ft for hundreds of locations daily.

However, they could still sell those other products and have invested more into the online market. Love it or hate that's now the market and will be for the considerable future (if not forever). Also, the albums are just too god damn expensive. If they could have reduced the album costs I probably would have bought more.

Sadly, they dropped the ball and iTunes (mainly) picked it up. It would have been extremely costly to battle with the giants such as Apple because they also source the 'cool' products which people love. Apple just offered people what they want, when they want and in a beautiful package. I understand the frustration people have with Apple products and such but for the mass market they're pretty much perfect and their sales and value completely demonstrate this.

These days schools employ cleaning staff, as modern parents (insofar as any parents that kennels their child can be regarded as modern) generally don't like the idea of their investments doing degrading manual work.  Many of the old stereotypes about Public Schools remain true, but they aren't quite as Victorian as they are widely regarded by the public.

It's also been foreshadowed by Virgin running a mirrorservice mirror on their network for quicker downloads for their customers. It's win-win - faster downloads for customers, less load on the network for Virgin.

Of course, it's wide open for abuse, and could still discriminate against other content holders depending on what you're doing (hosting linux isos or a Sourceforge mirror is unlikely to offend many people, YouTube, not so much).

Spend some time in Thailand or Eastern Europe, then when you've seen what a revolution is actually like you won't find it half as easy to suggest.

FWIW - I was in Thailand in May last year when the police started firing at crowds of protesters with live ammunition. I've also been to Croatia, Lebanon, Iran and Romania enough times to know that whatever grief you're thinking about casually from your armchair, it's nothing compared to what the people of Tehran have had to deal with for the past 30 years. Bangkok scared the shit out of me, Tehran did too but nothing serious kicked off while I was there.

Years back an office cleaner of mine told me about how she got out of Yugoslavia after being gang raped 3 times by Serbian death squads. These fuckers would go to a village, rape the women, then kill them when they fell pregnant by stabbing them through the stomach. Before then they'd make the male family members rape them too, then they'd make the men dig pits, they'd kill the women, then the men and fill the pits in. She got out with her brother, her mother had been missing and was presumed dead (she was never found) and her dad saved her and her brother's life by distracting a death squad - they shot him several times to make him scream so they'd come back, but he'd told them that no matter what they had to keep on going. I'm fairly certain that all sides in that war have their share of stories and death squads, when I was in Dubrovnik the villa I stayed in was riddled with bullet holes on one wall and had been used by the Croatians to execute the local Serb/Bosnian community.

Apologies for the long comment, but having seen what it's like and having spoken to people who've been through far worse, I get a little wound up when people threaten revolution in a country where you can still get elected to effect change.

true,Ashiro,cnty-england,England,"Its hard to say what student life is because there's a range of different sub-cultures as there is in any group. In my uni you had the hard working geeks. The rockers who drank and smoked weed all the time. The clubbers (trance/house) who went clubbing to dark places until 6am dropping pills. Then you've got the rugby guys who normally live in the student bar.

Each one has its different haunts, ideals, beliefs, etc. I can say with some certainty that whatever group you'd fit in with in the US would likely be similar in the UK.

Some points I can think of off the top of my head that are pretty common among most students:

 * Intoxication of any sort is common and VERY heavily encouraged.
 * The only constant with British weather is that its not constant. One minute it will be raining the next it will be bright sunshine and very hot. Its very random so pack plenty of different clothing.
 * Try drinking ""ale"" at pubs. Its normally warm and non-fizzy but its 10x better than shite lager. US beer would probably be called weasel-piss or lager in this country. Avoid things like Carling and Fosters (thoguh its very popular). Stella you drink if you want to beat people up. But no if you're in the UK you have to try some traditional English ale/beer.
 * Tea is popular though not as big as the stereotype would suggest. We don't have shrines to it for example. The best tea is ""Yorkshire Tea"" by far.
 * In comparison to Americans we can be quite reserved. Though at uni's students tend to be a lot more open. I've noticed Americans think nothing of speaking to random strangers in bars. If you did that in the UK without both being very pissed or both being students - the other person would likely think you're insane, dangerous or both. We keep ourselves to ourselves mostly. Like any generalisation there's exceptions. The fact you're American probably means you could get away with being all friendly and shit. But please don't push it. God it gives me chills to think of some random person suddenly getting all friendly and chatty in a bar.
 * The above doesn't apply to your flatmates or other students in your immediate area. We're not socially inept - just reserved!
 * Don't go on about your religion - if you have one. No one gives a shit. Religion is a personal thing and even a simple question can normally get a horrified suspicious look from some people.
 * Race and religion are both touchy subjects.

**Supermarket (Big Food Shop - Mall?) Summary**

If you decide to use the bigger food stores then here's a summary of them.

 * Morrisons - cheap-ish and have lots of offers like 2-for-1, etc.
 * Netto - VERY cheap European place. One of the cheapest (but dingey) places you can go.
 * Lidl - Same as Netto.
 * Aldi - similar to Lidl and Netto but not as cheap. Its a big con to look cheap but in actual fact its just as expensive as normal supermarkets.
 * Asda - Now owned by Walmart :(
 * Tesco - the best I think. Good balance between cheap and quality.
 * Coop - good for British and organic foods.
 * Sainsbury's &amp; Waitrose - posh and expensive.

It's the only one of the season I'd call ""merely OK"".

Hungry Earth and Cold Blood suffer from being unfocused. The sleep-mode ending is a deus ex machina, the humans themselves aren't really consistent, and the story is all over the place. Too many pointless characters and contradictory characterizations, most notably the Siliurian doc. The father is totally OK with the Siliurian doctor dissecting him because, hey, he kept his son alive. In the first episode, that doctor is a mad man. In the second, he's a nice guy.

Where did the missing bodies get to? Were the Siliurians traveling up the Earth before they're noticed for the first time?

Half the things are plot devices. If you see a plot of earth, smoking, do you stick your hand on it?

After the fall of Baghdad there was a 2-6month window where the Iraqi population was kinda happy with the foreign soldiers but when it became clear that they were doing nothing to stop the sectarian violence and looting, people rapidly lost faith in the coalition troops and eventually this turned into hatred.

In the same way that if the UK was invaded, you could tolerate the presence of troops if they kept the peace and you could go about your daily life in safety, but if a trip to Sainsburys was likely to result in taking fire, being car jacked or worse, and even if you made it there was likely to be no food, thoughts of fighting back are going to be in your head.

This allowed the fighting between the Sunni (who were trying to get the power lost from de-baathification back) and the Shia (who wanted revenge  for the shit that happened under Saddam) to become worse, and Iran and Saudi to use the region for attacks on Americans, and to extend their influence into Iraq. 

Had we sent in 100000 police officers along side additional military police, Blair and Bush could have claimed success and today would be far less hated. But somehow we managed to snatch defeat from the jaws of victory because politicians had never read chapter 19 of Machiavelli's The Prince.

As for the danger to civilians, it's mostly due to the nature of asymmetric warfare, the use of human shields and a reaction the the culture we have in the west. In WW2, urban fighting was likely to result in the civilians in a house you need to use as an fire position being turfed out. The lose everything they own, but they are likely to survive. Today, the Taliban or similar are far more likely to keep them in the same room, because when someone puts a 40mm through the window it's easy to remove any weapons and show the media that US troops randomly shot a family up. I can guarantee you that had the US or British forces been able to use the same tactics as we used in WW2, with the same civilian casualty rates, Iraq and Afghanistan would have been over in a year or so. But thankfully we're not that stupid.

I live in a city where if I want to travel four miles by bus it takes me 40 minutes. It's quicker for me to cycle (and battle the half retarded car users who cause that 10 minutes a mile bus journey due to endless congestion). Want to travel to a part of town that isn't the city centre? That's a1 hour journey via the city centre!

 Even the suggestion that we should improve any form of transport other than the car is met with the same reaction as a Hitler walking into a jewish temple with a ham sandwich and a prawn cocktail in each hand by the general public in this city, who also seem convinced that building a car park in the city would be a good idea and in no way cause mass congestion.

I feel like a second class citizen for not joining the a already crowded roads, and whenever I hear anyone complain about the""war on the driver"" I want to kick their heads in and force them to realise that we're in a three mile long queue we collectively caused by hoping into our cars and collectively trying to get to the same, already crowded point in time and space like the lemmings we are.

And yes I know public transport is expensive and only small parts of london has copenhagen style cycle lanes, but improving public transport to make it more competitive with the car and making it easier to walk or cycle would be a better idea than tote pouring (more) petrol on the tire fire that is the transport infrastructure of this country, as 1 train is more efficient than 300 cars, and walking or cycling 1 mile causes less congestion than driving the same distance.",0,1294319554,null,0,false,0,c1bn05o,t3_ex4pq,t1_c1bn05o,t3_ex4pq,1426675244,7,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,7

They share many similarities (aquatic name, same watch, handcuffs, married but flirts with the doctor, etc). I am almost 100% confident that Amy's house is a disguised TARDIS (the door + stairs that lead to nowhere apparent). Perhaps this is River's time machine that she's hiding (she sure knows how to pilot one). Further clue- it's in a fictional place called Leadworth which, according to the doctor, a place that ""time forgot."" Leadworth probably doesn't exist at all, because even though there are no ducks in the pond, Amy is quite insistent that it's a duck pond (the actual location doesn't have a pond in it; it was created for the shooting). 
I don't think River is a Timelady, but she's very much like them (minus the regenaration). When the doctor walks through the crack in the Big Bang and everyone forgets the doctor, River is still able to remember, along with Amy Pond of course (I really think there's a connection). 
The big twist will probably be something like this- Amy is not who we thought she was all along, Rory's ""tragic mistake"" would be to still try to save Amy, and River will have to perform a mercy killing (I would say on Rory, but he doesn't seem to be important enough for her to be locked up in a super secure prison).",0,1294333469,null,0,false,0,c1bntcj,t3_exbeh,t1_c1bntcj,t1_c1bnpk2,1426675622,35,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,35

Of course it's possible.  This is Doctor Who.  ANYTHING is possible.  Flying monkeys from Venus could have found her as a sea slug living in a methane environment on Clom's moon and infused her DNA with that of Romana's changing her into a clone of Romana, but with a different look.  From there, she breathed in particles of triclobosalt and gained the one-time ability to time travel to the 52nd century where she killed someone and was imprisoned at Stormgate.

That is all possible.  Just not very probable.

My strongest feelings in the River/Jenny hypothesis have to do with the Doctor's name. He insists, during this argument if I remember correctly, that there is only one way she -could- know his name.

What does that mean, exactly? By Occam's Razor, it would mean she is also a Timelord or at least Gallifreyan, since they seem to use names on Gallifrey as we do on Earth. This is just the simplest answer, or would be, if the Planet and race weren't locked away, presumably for good, since The End of Time.

They only made this feature available for Xbox 360 *years* after the console arrived - and you still need to put the physical disc in.  The games do at least play better (shorter loading times).

I hadn't tried pre-loading anything with my PS3, but I'm disappointed to learn that it wouldn't work at all.

What's really frustrating is that because MS ruled out HD-loading initially, games were all required to play from a disc.  That likely limited a lot of them.  And then Mass Effect(?) - with two DVDs - arrgh.  I can't fully remember, but I think you even had to keep swapping them after preloading was eventually enabled.  I could be wrong.

**I** don't beleive in an afterlife and I'm fully aware of 'oblivion' and I'm not afraid of it.  If its my time to go, so be it.  And we've seen that River isn't some pansy.  She's a bit of a brash badass, but isn't afraid of anything.

In fact, think of living for centuries like a time lord.  Wouldn't you get tired of life after a while?  

You might argue that River's additude would be to fight tooth and nail, but when we first see her, we see a *mature* woman who has already experienced life to the fullest, including being married to, and adventured with, the Doctor.  

What else is there to do after that?!?

**IF** she was a timelord (I think its a silly idea, but as I've said NONE of us have an inkling of what is in the writers heads), I think it's totally possible for her to let go after living a life like that.

The older series has said there are only 13 regenerations.  It appears the new series suggests that the limit of the past was self imposed...a gallifreyan law of sorts.  Immortality is sort of 'wrong' in a way.  Who's to say her mature self was following that law?

&gt; &gt; good journalism in the realms of technology and it really shows you

The people do not want the passing of the Digital Economy Bill. Ignored.
The governments own drug experts' advice, and the opinions of the people who know fine well what should be legalised and what shouldnt. Ignored.
The people do not want Rupert Murdoch to have too much control over the media, and in turn, opinions. Ignored.
Vince Cable declares war on Rupert Murdoch. Sacked for impartiality, to be replaced by Murdoch's biggest fan.
Bankers now receive almost twice as much in yearly bonuses than they did before the crash. Meanwhile, student fees are tripled, the opinions of the masses who disagree with this? That's right, ignored.
The list is endless. Elections do not effect change, they merely replace one bunch of lieing idiots who ignore the people, with another bunch of lieing idiots.

Dont get me wrong, Im about as peace-loving as they come, but this system where politicians vote and decide laws based on what side has put enough money into their pockets is bang out of order. Whether it be in my lifetime, or another, there will be change. If there was a God I'd pray to him that the change was a peaceful one, but just how willing do you think a bunch of expensively educated toffs will be to hand over their power to the people? The fact is that it may well take a broken nose and some smashed windows.

We closed down profitable routes instead of improving the ones we have now! Why? Because a certain transport minister by the name of Doctor Beaching had a wife who had shares in Pickfords! The Beaching cuts was the start of the decline that caused our railways to be the mess they are today! 

The french opened their first high speed rail route (the famous TGV trains) between Lyon and Paris in 1981 whilst journeys on our network actually slowed down. Journey times between Edinburgh and London are slower now then they were in the 1960s.

The simple fact is that our railways need MASSIVE improvements made, sadly for us, the public and indeed the government at the moment haven't got the will or the money to do any form of mass improvement for our rail network as a whole, only small improvements (ala new trains, new halt at convenient location) and/or some overpriced railfan-ejaculation inducing projects that sound like big improvements, but fall short of something that would be a massive improvement (ala High Speed rail, tram-trains).

Tonight's show is a little different  
Tonight's show is about a man, who's not really a man  
He's a doctor, but he's not really a doctor.  
Like Doctor Phil, but awesome.  
Most people in the United States of America have not heard of him.  
He's just like me in that regard.
Who is he? He's the doctor.

In 1963 the BBC premiered a show about an alien  
who travels through space space to combat all kind of evils

**Sid**  
He's a force for good in an otherwise uncertain universe.

**Late Night Douchebag**  
You are correct in the summation of his character my profane raaabit friend.

**Geoff Peterson**  
Ooohhh, tell me more.

**The Scottish Conan Guy**  
The show has been in production... almost fifty years.  
With many different actors in the role of the doctor.

**Wavy Rancheros**  
The Doctor doesn't die he just regenerates

**Liza Minelli**  
The crocodile-alligator speaks the truth.

One thing it's consistent for, and this is why the show is so beloved by geeks and nerds,  
it's all about the triumph of intellect and romance  
over brute force and cynicism.  

**All**  
intellect and romance over brute force and cynicism

**CraigyFerg**

true,bowling4meth,english,Straight out of Surrey,"First off, thanks for responding. It's always good to have a civil debate. I used to have an anarchist friend (this was years and years ago before I sold out to the man, so to speak). He was a massive promoter of anarchism and localised collectivism (where it was beneficial for people and didn't infringe upon the rights of the individual, really interesting guy) but rejected the urge/need to protest. I once asked him what as an anarchist someone could do. His response was priceless:

""Wait for the revolution to come. At some point all empires fail. Until then be the change in the world you want to see."" - Years later I found out he was paraphrasing Ghandi to an extent, but he's right, to a point (at least I think so).

&gt; Im sorry, I even agree with you so much I upvoted you, but as far as Im concerned this system cannot continue.

You're right. The system perpetuated by the previous government cannot continue. The system will be changed to meet the needs of the new government, but this will take time. However, the coalition doesn't necessarily have time, so they have to rush stuff through as quickly as they can.

&gt; You say we live in a country where elections can effect change, you sure about that?

Absolutely. If you look at the debates, the Lib Dems got in on the back of 'not being like the other two', and the other two didn't win because they're both tarnished. Now we know the Lib Dems are worse than the other two, because they lack the courage in their convictions to carry out what they stand for, that is if they stand for anything at all beyond being in power. I think you're going to see a change over the next few terms as (I hope) no party will be able to hold on to power for more than a full term, hopefully even less. It's in these periods that new parties and new orders arise, hopefully for the better.

&gt; The people do not want the passing of the Digital Economy Bill. Ignored.

If you think that the government represents your interests, I have a bridge I'd like to sell you.

&gt; The governments own drug experts' advice, and the opinions of the people who know fine well what should be legalised and what shouldnt. Ignored.

That's because while there are people in government right now who oppose the war on drugs and all the bullshit that comes with it, there are people that want to ban smoking, internet pornography, drinking and anything that's basically remotely enjoyable in the name of the children etc. - if hanging these people would stop it from arising again, I have a fuck load of rope you're more than welcome to make a start with. Somehow if we string those fuckers up, they'll just be replaced by other fuckers. What we need to do is to make sure that enough people who are pro-legalisation (and have it high enough on their agenda) get in to pass the vote, because unless society supports it enough (and drugs are still seen to be a bad thing) and the vote passes in parliament it's not going to happen. The very idea that scientists have any input on government policy is just a veneer, they can always find a scientist to say what they want and put him in charge if they want.

&gt; The people do not want Rupert Murdoch to have too much control over the media, and in turn, opinions. Ignored.

I'm not sure I get this one. Most of 'the people' either don't know who Murdoch is, the extent of his empire, or don't care as far as I can tell. I am sorry, but the same applies to the drugs and digital economy bill. Those that know about it oppose it, but we're a minority. Thankfully the government is a minority too, we just need to be more organised than them.

&gt; Vince Cable declares war on Rupert Murdoch. Sacked for impartiality, to be replaced by Murdoch's biggest fan.

So one lying flip-flopping politician is tagged out for another for not toeing the party line? That's hardly news, it's a subplot in an episode of the thick of it, and Vince wouldn't eat the pissy biscuit.

&gt; Bankers now receive almost twice as much in yearly bonuses than they did before the crash.

And for banks that are on the stock exchange that is a question for stock holders, not the government (except where the government is a major stockholder).

&gt; Meanwhile, student fees are tripled, the opinions of the masses who disagree with this? That's right, ignored.

Again, it's not important enough to a significant majority (AFAICT) and there are plenty of people who support rising student fees, as incredulous to you as that may sound (I'm assuming you're of an age where it would affect you, please do correct me if I'm wrong).

&gt; The list is endless. Elections do not effect change, they merely replace one bunch of lieing idiots who ignore the people, with another bunch of lieing idiots.

I'm so glad you got it in the end. There's so many people that don't. This is good. This is your starting point for change.

&gt; Dont get me wrong, Im about as peace-loving as they come, but this system where politicians vote and decide laws based on what side has put enough money into their pockets is bang out of order. Whether it be in my lifetime, or another, there will be change.

As my anarchist friend would often tell me, all we can do is wait. There are 'accelatory' options (for want of a better, real word) which I'll come to later.

 

 If there was a God I'd pray to him that the change was a peaceful one, but just how willing do you think a bunch of expensively educated toffs will be to hand over their power to the people? The fact is that it may well take a broken nose and some smashed windows. I do not want people to die, but neither do I want to continue living in a world where I am blatantly lied to and ignored by people who claim to represent me, but clearly represent only themselves.

&gt; If there was a God I'd pray to him that the change was a peaceful one, but just how willing do you think a bunch of expensively educated toffs will be to hand over their power to the people?

There's a lot of people in this country that still believe in magical sky pixies, you'd do well as a politician to at least honour their beliefs, or not correct them, no matter if you don't agree with them. Still, on to the second part of your question. Ah yes, accelatory options.

You do it from within, and you do it with numbers. Cameron's doing it now to the Tory party. From the outside he may not seem so much of a radical, but he's actually tearing the place apart from the inside, as is Nick Clegg. These are not the Tories of Churchill's time, nor Thatcher's, nor Gladstone's. These are New Tories(tm). Clegg is about as far from traditional SDP views as you can get. So how do we effect change? From the inside. It worked for Hitler (and if you're serious about it, then I'd highly recommend studying his rise to power as he infiltrated a hated party and got them to power within just over a decade and an opposing ideology).

&gt; The fact is that it may well take a broken nose and some smashed windows. I do not want people to die, but neither do I want to continue living in a world where I am blatantly lied to and ignored by people who claim to represent me, but clearly represent only themselves.

true,ananinginaneana,scottish,Ex-Exile,"Yes, sadly there still exist those in Scotland who hate and cannot tell the difference between the English people and the UK Establishment, but I believe that most nationalists have grown beyond this point. The main barrier to Scottish independence is our fellow Scots, or more specifically, [idiots like this](http://newsnetscotland.com/politics/1344-labours-iain-gray-sparks-diplomatic-row-after-ethnic-cleansing-slur) and his gang of supporters at the [British Bullshit Corp north in Pacific Quay](http://newsnetscotland.com/speakers-corner/1354-scottish-news-from-the-bbc-and-a-question-of-diplomacy). It is to these people that the venom of most nationalists is directed - not the English.

However, the level of hate speech towards Scotland i've seen on the www since the election of the SNP has amazed me. The constant mis-reporting of the true nature of Scotland's contribution to the Exchequer must have something to do with this I believe. There seems to be developing a bit of a chip on the shoulder down south.

Unfortunately, because of [this](http://news.scotsman.com/edinburgh/Power-cut-leaves-the-lights.6682555.jp) my pc blue-screened last night and I have lost all my bookmarks (temporarily I hope) - working from Puppy Linux on a disk atm. So I cannot provide you with links.

The relevant document you require to consider is the annual Government Expenditure and Revenue Survey (GERS). It is produced by government statisticians and shows Scotland to be a net contributor to the UK over a long period. Since the SNP administration took over certain ""errors"", such as including a proportion of the corporation tax on whiskey production in the figures for England, have been corrected (the companies for which the figures were included were registered in England, however on independence they would have to set up a Scottish registered subsidiary which would then be taxed in Scotland).

North Sea oil and gas revenues - well I don't see how you could talk about the Scottish economy and tax receipts without including this. Just as you wouldn't be able to consider the English economy without considering the City of London and its benefit to the English economy.

But let's not stop there. There is the Crown Estate which controls the shore and seabed. All the revenues go south. Scotland is about to enjoy a boom which could be greater even than the North Sea - we could produce 100% of our electricity needs through renewables and be a net exporter. Strange then that the Labour govt refused to the bitter end and the Tories (though initially appearing to reverse Labour's position) now also seem to be refusing to give back to Scotland the £200m Climate Change Levy, paid by Scottish consumers, to allow the development of this sector. It is sitting in a bank down south, collecting dust.

Defense; Scotland now contributes £0.8Billion more to the Defense budget than is spent in Scotland - and that is before the MOD almost moves lock stock and barrel out of Scotland. The MOD has now decided to stop providing regional breakdowns of where it spends its budget - I wonder why.

The BBC; viewers in Scotland again pay more in license fees than is spent by the BBC in Scotland. So another Scottish subsidy to England.

We need a media that can debate and inform on these issues - unfortunately that is sadly lacking in the UK at present.",0,1294443929,null,0,false,0,c1buy8o,t3_exrdl,t1_c1buy8o,t1_c1buid1,1426679032,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2
