true,aussiekinga,dalek,Dalek,"The 1st series is very good, but I can understand his suggesting you skip over it, if he thought you were going to be unsure about the show. In the early episodes there are some bad ones such as *Aliens of London* and *WW3*. The farting aliens are just annoying. Added with *the Unquiet Dead* which I thought was a average at best episode, you have 3 of the first 5 being passable.  
Other than those 3 though, you have a solid season. And the introduction of Jack and the events at the end of the season are kinda important for some of the later episodes.

I think how I got into it is probably fairly different to many others. I used to watch the old series, and had seen bits and pieces of most of the Doctor's, if only with vague memories of the actual events of the episode. I remember sitting down and watching the 1996 movie when it premiered. 

After that, I watched some of the series 1 when it started, but I must have seen only those 2 or 3 episodes I mentioned above, because I remember not liking it.

The reasons: 

1) Overly centralized power favours lobbying over voters, if you have a government body with power over a vast economic area then corporations will throw vast amounts of money into corrupting it. If they have to corrupt each individual legislature it will be more expensive for them and so less worth the effort. 

2) I'm a liberal and believe the default unit of regulation is the individual, individuals band together out of necessity for larger regulation you don't automatically try and have everything regulated by one world government. So for example I don't think babysitting your friends children in a quid-pro-quo manner needs to be regulated by the government, New Labour disagreed. 

3) I do not feel that the EU is very democratic, with so many people voting such large power blocks (not to mention the EC which isn't even elected?!) I feel like we have almost no say in what's going on there, this is frankly fucking worrying when they start doing things like extending copyright (a decision which is clearly bad for individuals).

If you browse /r/Europe, literally one of the biggest circlejerks on Reddit besides /r/Scotland, you see any sort of questioning of the EU project being labelled ""Euroskepticism"", hence your point can be safely ignored and the downvotes come in droves.

However, the UK is not particularly Euroskeptic as a country.  We're a member of the EU, which is more than what can be said for Norway, Switzerland or Iceland (for the time being).  We also tend to comply fully with EU regulations, which is more than can be said for the likes of Italy and France, a country that was still banning the importation of British beef for years after the BSE scare had ended.  Further, we contribute more than our fair share of money and resources to the European project.

BUT: the UK just doesn't go along with every stupid idea that comes out of Brussels.  Namely, the idea of a currency union throughout the EU was always a stupid idea.  I don't think there can be much reasonable debate on this point: tying the likes of Greece and Germany together into a single currency, with a one size fits all monetary policy was always a stupid idea.  The UK did well to steer well clear, and on this score, the supposed Euroskeptics got their predictions entirely right.  At the first sizeable recession, the Euro seems to be tottering on the edge of oblivion.

We actually need Euroskepticism to keep ourselves getting caught up in similar stupid projects.  We're talking about fundamental changes to how countries are governed.  Euroskepticism should be the default, not an aberration from the norm.

Further, there seems to be massive imbalances in who wins and who loses in the EU.  Without Thatcher's rebate, we'd still be paying in a massive amount to subsidise French peasant farmers who are still farming the land like it's the early 1800s.  Policies like the CAP seem to be sacrosanct: some countries are onto a good thing, so there's no way in hell that it's going to change any time soon.

Overall, though, the EU apparatus, especially the common market and getting big science projects funded across Europe has been pretty good for everybody.

The EU expanded far too quickly, it was much too keen to see ascension states see full membership and this has in turn placed more pressure on the leading states, but the idea itself was a fair one, if poorly executed.

I do draw issue with the UK increasingly being one of the largest financial contributors and yet one of the poorest net recipients, but what really grinds my axle is when the pro-EU argument says that it brings more benefits that we'd otherwise miss out on.

My response to this is always 'name one', and I've yet to receive.  

There's nothing stopping the UK leaving the EU but remaining part of the EEA for far, far less.  EEA members get free movement of goods, persons, services, and capital.  They also get a veto on all EU directives that might effect effect them and input via an EEA committee, so if there are any single market laws written up which technically they might have to accept (a) they don't have to, and (b) they do have input.  The UK currently gets input, it's voting powers  represent only 8% and they get no such veto on common market EU directives.  Other than that UK manufacturers would have to meet EU regulations to trade in the EU, much as UK manufacturers have to meet US regulations, or Chinese regulations, or Indian, Australian, if they want to trade in those respective countries.

So the benefits to free movement for trade, people, services and capital does not count as that can still be achieved outside the EU.  So what else are the benefits?  Human rights?

The European Convention on Human Rights was drafted by the Council of Europe, not the European Council; they're two distinct bodies.  One is part of the EU, the other is not.  When the UK signed the UK Human Rights Act 1998 into law it was(n't)* signing an EU convention into law.  The Council of Europe has 47 members.  The UK did not have to sign the Convention into UK law - it did not need to be part of the EU to do it either.  

There are other reasons why I'm opposed for the UK being part of the EU; diminished trade rights, diminished control of agricultural and fishery policy, many of the EU funds that we do receive can only be spent where the EU has earmarked them which sometimes isn't applicable to the UK (like regional assemblies which they ultimately cancelled after wasting tens of millions), diminished democratic representation, a more aloof government, the UK no longer having a UK seat at the World Trade Organisation, diminished control of quotas,...,...

**It goes on with the negatives but what I really need to know is what are the benefits to the EU which cannot be achieved outside the EU as part of the EEA, or that Britain couldn't implement itself if it chose to to an even greater extent and for much less?**

The real problem with Europe is the politicians understand that we do not really have the option of being ""nice people"". There isn't much difference between sovereign and superpower in the real world. The public do not understand just how beholden we and Europe were to the US in the period from about 1950 to 1980. Also they do not realise just how much the US abused that to influence our foreign policy. The fact Europe seemed to catch up and in some cases outperform the US after that time period is solely because the US gave up its position of power when it defaulted on redemption of the dollar. The slow decay of the US dates back to the Nixon shock.

In short our politicians do not want the UK to once again be overpowered by an entity they have no control over. They do not want a situation where British foreign policy can just be undermined by the US threatening the stability of British currency (as they did numerous times between the end of WW2 and the end of the Bretton-Woods system during Nixon's time). We at least have a strong voice in the EU even if we choose not to use it often enough.

In short the public do not understand international politics and thus do not understand why the EU is a necessity. They aren't helped by the fact our politicians pretended we were independent when for about 30 years the UK was just a US protectorate more or less. It isn't helped by a rose tinted view of the US relationship which has largely been abusive if in our general interest as the most relevant and independent of the protectorates.

OTOH the Europeans in general are less prideful. They know exactly how pathetic the EU nations were during the cold war and have no interest in returning to that era. So they are pushing far more strongly for it. If the UK left the EU we probably could do reasonably in the EEA but it would once again be us being beholden to a super power we have no say in.

I don't like the EU as it means that democracy is moved even further away from the people than before. We already have an archaic election system, even Andorra use  that maintains the status quo and ensures that only a minority of people are represented. That voice is then watered down further within the EU, before the unelected EC decides what is actually happening. 

I don't want to give up our sovereignty to the EU nor do I feel we've ever been consulted on it. Where was our promised referredum? We didn't get it because they knew we would say no. What happened in Ireland, they said no and then pulled the financial rug from under them and bullied them into saying yes. What happened to the no votes from France and the Netherlands, they just renamed it a treaty to step around it. The people of Europe do not want a federal states of europe. 

The idea of free trade is fine, but we palpably do not need the EU for that as the likes of Norway and Switzerland have shown. We don't need the EU to trade with China or India so why do we pretend we need it to trade with Germany, we don't. I could go on and on why I hate the EU but i'll probably leave it on one last point. 

We have had massive immigration because of the EU, again, the British people were not consulted on this and have been repeatedly lied to about how many people would come here. I have absolutely nothing against these people themselves, they are understandably just doing the best for themselves, but you cannot just have millions of people come in as we do not have the housing, schools, hospitals or jobs to accomodate them all. They have lowered wages and we cannot do a thing about it because it has been decided by someone else, which is my fundamental issue, that the people should decide not, other people who do not live here. 

Don't get me started on the Euro and the bailouts too. All of the welfare cuts that everyone on here complains about daily save about £8bn over three years, yet we have gifted over the to Greece in the summer alone. Add in Ireland, Portugal, our contribution to the IMF and we're up around £30bn.

Its obvious it would have been a disaster to join the Euro and so I can see that I was wrong in the past. It's easy for me to see now but the reason the dollar works is because there is a massive shift of funds from rich states to poor ones. New York is constantly ""bailing out"" Alabama. There's nothing like that going on in Europe so there's no way that it can work financially.

As for political unity I like the way things are now with Europe as a sort of Supreme Court over England's highest courts.

true,[deleted],null,null,"Again I don't really see the international argument for the UK, and I'm not trying to be deliberately obstinate.  

International policy is sometimes made by the EU3 but now there is an EU commissioner for trade and a High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security - both appointed non-elected officials, but Britain, France and Germany would still speak on such matters outside of Europe.  Britain retains its seat on the Security Council but has lost its seat at the WTO.  It still helps drive European military intervention and would continue to do so outside Europe, Norway outside the EU both contributes to the EU task force and was part of the initial coalition over Libya.   Outside the EU however the UK regains its WTO seat and is placed to make its own trade agreements without going through Europe.  Britain is excellently placed to build on its own trade with its position within the Commonwealth of Nations.  That and its manufacturing industry and exports is high-end and specialised; it doesn't really need a trading bloc in the EU, even though it would still be part of the single market through the EEA.

There's a strong argument that Britain could actually improve its international strengths; trade, military and diplomacy, by moving outside the EU.  I'd far rather have stronger ties with the Commonwealth and develop growth there than with certain East European countries and other major trading partners of the EU which aren't nearly as stable.  We'd generally be more welcomed too.  The UK would be better placed by being able to negotiate its own trade to build bridges with some of those countries where we don't have such a good track record.  Britain on its own could make some serious headway in both central and Latin America, Africa and the Asian sub-continent too.  As for non-EU UK connections strengthened by default through the EU I think the UK would be served well at this moment of time to distance themselves more from the likes of Romania, Armenia, Turkey and Georgia.  Best of luck to all of them but internationally they all have colds and hives.  I'm more than happy to keep talking to them, I'd rather it were just through the perspex glass of quarantine. 

I'd also argue that there's quite a deal of international influence that the UK should resist, and that for its own sake beyond trade should turn down.  International influence for the sake of international influence isn't a good thing.  

As for the economic/social benefits of being in the EU, I'd appreciate it if you do pass on any interesting info you find, but remember I'm specifically looking for that which could not have been achieved by the UK outside the European Union.  So, even if there is a success story, the question still has to be asked - and why could it not have been achieved by the UK from outside the EU?",0,1317131319,null,0,true,0,c2mxm7p,t3_ksbu7,t1_c2mxm7p,t1_c2mxe7m,1427653073,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

true,[deleted],null,null,"I am [studying](http://i.imgur.com/Um1PX.png) toward a BSc Computing atm. Have done M150, MU123, MST121, MS221, M263 and am starting M255 now.  It's a Qual you will not be able to do though (B29) as it ends in 2014. You will need to do Computing and 'IT', B62 or B67.

Firstly, the level 1 computing courses are trivially simple. M150 barely provided even a basic intro to javascript, covered perhaps 6 html tags, skipped css and instead dealt with xml/xslt and provided a very basic grounding in other topics. That course does not exist now and has been replaced by TU100. From what I've heard it's even worse. They have replaced all the real introductions to programming with a 'lego' language like Yahoo Pipes or something. Basically it teaches you concepts but no transferable skills. Saying that, programming might not be your thing, so it might not be so bad. The new degrees offer several different pathways so you don't need to do programming.

The level 2 courses don't seem too bad though. M263 suffered as it has to repeat a lot of basics about datatypes and basic inheritance before getting into specification/implementation, logic, proof of connectedness etc. M263 also has a course specific language which many people felt was a complete waste of time as it isn't that transferable. 

I think repeated material may be a general problem with most of the OU stuff, as they try hard not to assume any previous study except for courses listed on the course description, which they keep to a minimum. 

I would also strongly recommend MST121 and MS221 as well. The maths complements a lot of the computing. Modular arithmetic and group theory for encryption, various methods of proof, iterative and recursive functions, geometric transformations, calculus, taylor series.. they are all covered in-depth in the maths courses and are vital for computing imo. With that said, unless you were exceptionally weak at maths in school, avoid MU123 completely. That was the one optional course that I regret doing. It was far too simple. It starts at BIDMAS rules and barely goes beyond quadratic equations. Much of the material is repeated more concisely in the pre-course revision book for MST121 anyway.

true,[deleted],null,null,"I studied for a degree part-time over four years at a 'normal' university whilst working full time. The attendance commitment was two evenings per week and on top of that I'd spend a couple of other evenings and half of Sunday.

The OU would've been disastrous for me as I would never have had enough motivation to go on for four long years without having to face a few seminars per week. This is something that deserves serious consideration as it will be a significant lifestyle change if you want to do well.

During the first few weeks there were loads of people who just had unrealistic expectations of what was involved in studying for a degree, even the fairly easy first year meant we ended up losing about 60% of the students. Of those that remained, some just kind of scraped by for the rest of the degree and progressively dropped out as it dawned on them that they might scrape a third if they were lucky. I think by the final year we were down to about 15% of the original in-take.

Of the roughly 120 original students, I think about six people received a 2:1 or higher. It's not that the course was full of idiots, loads of people were very intelligent but fitting everything around your job and what little is left of your life isn't a huge amount of fun.

So, how did I find it? At times it was great, at times it was awful. If you have a goal in mind, it'll help. I don't know what your job is but do your best to get some relevant experience whilst you're at uni - it'll make you much more employable but also might even sometimes give you a reason to carry on.

I'm going to be wearing shorts. The rest of my body is going to be marked by different shapes and I'm carrying around an easel with body paints on it.

Get into a groove with your work early in the term. If you make a habit of reading over stuff you did in the lessons that day, even if it's only half an hour every night or in your frees, you get into the habit of revising. 

Organise notes. New booklet on Stalinist Russia or redox reactions? WHIP OUT YOUR FUCKING HOLE PUNCH YOU PRICK. Order things in your file by topic and chronologically (that's just a suggestion of how to order them, I found that really efficient). Take time with your file, make it look really pretty, and an extra plus is that it's a great listener and is a good cuddle in bed.

Time management ... hmmm ... do your best with your homework, and give yourself time to relax. If you're not enjoying yourself, you learn to resent revision, THAT'S NOT GOOD. My homework per night often averaged an hour, but I also messed around in my frees. Free periods are a godsend.

Ask ask ask ask ask ask ask ask. If you don't understand talk to the goddamn teacher. If they smell, man up and wear a clothes peg on your nose. If they are incomprehensible find out for yourself. If there's a gap somewhere bloody well fill it with educational Polyfilla.

Most of all motivate yourself. Here's a good one: IF YOU DON'T FUCKING REVISE YOU'RE A SHIT

Oh, also, read more. It's good.

What we do have, is an image that every single person portrays. Some do it in a more public manner, others in private. Either way, Hugh Laurie has created a highly-rated image of himself though the quality and selection of his work. Call it a 'reputation', if you will.

WH Smiths sell different coloured revision cards. Buy them, and write important notes on them in manageable chunks. Get your friends or family to test you on them. 

Make a timetable for the weeks of free time before exams. Make it realistic. Let's say you can do 6 hours a day. Organise your days so that you do varied activities; do 2 hours of one topic of one subject, then a short break, then 2 hours of another, then a short break, then two hours of another. Mixing it up will keep it fresh and make you more able to switch between one thing and another, but two hours is enough to get as detailed as you need.

Work hard in your scheduled periods; do not procrastinate. Be absolutely free and enjoy yourself in your free periods; do not think about work at all (set an alarm which tells you when your periods end, so that you wont be thinking about them). So much time is wasted - both free time and working time - by guilt-inducing procrastination during work hours and feeling guilty about your free time in free hours.

Newer doctors would have to pretend they weren't the doctor, if they ran into themselves.   


In fact,  I would love to see an episode where Backer is running around seaming completely off his rocker and there are so many odd things happening that it strains belief (Tardis moves on it's own, sonic shows up somewhere it wasn't, locked doors unlock at the best time, enemies have stuff fall on them, etc.)  Then the next episode is a newer doctor filling in some of those gaps, same time frame as the first episode just answering some of the questions and maybe bringing up more.  This would keep going like that for a few episodes until all the loose ends were cleaned up, and each doctor could save the day without the others knowing he was there.  If the story was inserting and well written, you could even have each episode having different themes as the doctor has to handle different things.  Even some points where the Doctor has new information his older self didn't have and is actively working against himself.  At the end we have an actor poking his nose in and we have no idea who he is.  It turns out he is the next Doctor after Smith and we don't see him again until Smith regenerates, or make the end of the arc Smiths regeneration and the ""bad guy"" from the entire arc turns out to be the next Doctor and he was really saving the universe by undoing everything the previous doctors were doing.

true,TheAuditor5,null,null,"Really does depend on the subjects you are doing. Obviously past papers for all are a must: when it comes to maths and science you need to drill yourself with them in an ordered 'sit-down' manner. Take things in test conditions as much as possible: I found that it stretched your brain just a little bit further than you would have otherwise. For an arts course you might want to take a more relaxed approach, brainstorming answers to questions, nailing how you plan out an essay.

Speaking as a science student, textbooks are always a good bet. It's a sad thing to do and doesn't reflect well on our system but you can do very well in exams by repetitively condensing it down to note form. For the more tricky parts that require some level of deduction rather than rote answers, I found discussing things with my classmates helped a lot and let you think 'outside the box'. Reading outside the course specification helps too.

Of course, if there is coursework you need to nail that: makes the exams so much less of a hassle knowing you've already banked an A. Read widely in your spare time, if you study any English course you should be doing this anyway. Make a small study of history, even if you aren't studying it: context behind a piece of literature is always a good talking point. If not, relate it to birth, death, marriage, gender or love. These are all your classic areas and provided you are creative enough with your reasoning, are easy marks.

Ram a banana down your throat before any exam. Set yourself a revision timetable and stick to it. In fact, start a calendar *now*, don't let exam periods creep up on you.

And the biggest thing that I fell afoul of: **do not rely on your teachers**. I've had teachers teach irrelevancies, talk about their private lives for most the lessons, can't be arsed to mark work, give no help in finding past papers, and be absolutely so fucking incompetent they barely know the stuff themselves, let alone finish the course before exam period.

**The Way Through The Woods** - Personally, I did not enjoy it. I know it's Doctor Who, but the story was just way too bizarre for me.

Use the [pomorodo technique](http://www.focusboosterapp.com/live) (that is work in 25 minute sessions and leave 5 minutes of break time between each session.) Make a point of ONLY working in the 25 allocated work time and ONLY relaxing in the 5 minute time. See how many pomorodos you can do in one day and try and beat your score.

You should be getting 8-9 hours sleep per day and be waking up by 9:00; even on a weekend. [Sleepyti.me](http://sleepyti.me/) does wonders to your sleep schedule. If you ever feel tired because you over slept it's probably because you're dehydrated. Fix that. Your most productive hours are between 10:00-14:00. Exercise helps -- running for 15 minutes every day will do wonders for your concentration. So does eating healthily -- avoid carbs and avoid sugar. Eat lots of vegetables, fish and fruit. [Nap](http://www.napsounds.com/) when you're out of school at mid day. 

Writing notes by hand will help you remember more than typing notes up. Don't just copy out what you read; summarise it and use your own words. Visualise things and put them into context. Make things funny and memorable; perhaps link what you need to know to reddit memes. [Anki](http://ankisrs.net/) has been recommended to me as it forces you answer short memory questions before you log into your phone/computer.

Read around your syllabus and read around the subject area. If you can't read, download audiobooks, lectures or podcasts and listen to them on doing menial things for extended periods. 

Do stuff outside school; join as many clubs and societies as possible. You'll end up more productive as you will learn to organise your free time and it will give you something for the personal statement. Treat work as what it is and don't compromise your social life for it. You shouldn't have more than 15 hours of work a week and even the busiest person could fit that in.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt;The real problem with Europe is the politicians understand that we do not really have the option of being ""nice people"". 

Yes.  Yes we do.

&gt;The public do not understand just how beholden we and Europe were to the US in the period from about 1950 to 1980.

Small contributing matter of most of the major cities and industrial hubs being smoldering mounds of rubble in 1945 and everything being geared to a war economy might have something to do with that, that and an ongoing Cold War.

&gt;The fact Europe seemed to catch up and in some cases outperform the US after that time period is solely because the US gave up its position of power when it defaulted on redemption of the dollar. 

That and Europe rebuilt its economy, the UK was coming out of the Winter of Discontent.  

&gt;In short our politicians do not want the UK to once again be overpowered by an entity they have no control over. They do not want a situation where British foreign policy can just be undermined by the US threatening the stability of British currency (as they did numerous times between the end of WW2 and the end of the Bretton-Woods system during Nixon's time).

The UK does not need to be a part of Europe for that, if anything you're exchanging a US for an EU, repeating the same mistake.

&gt;We at least have a strong voice in the EU even if we choose not to use it often enough.

The UK has 8% of the vote - and it's split.  Of the UK government coalition the major Conservative partner belongs to the 4th largest voting bloc in Europe (ECR), the Lib Dems the 3rd (ELDR).  The shadow government, the party that came 3rd in the UK European elections, is part of the 2nd largest EU voting bloc (S&amp;D).  The party that came second in the UK European elections, their voting bloc collapsed in 2009 (ID).  They effectively have 18 MEPs across Europe.

Strong. Voice.  Not.  Is.  The.

The UK does admittedly have the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy in Baroness Ashton, only she's duty bound to serve the interest of the Commission and she's never been elected to office in the UK.  So not great.

&gt;In short the public do not understand international politics and thus do not understand why the EU is a necessity.

So inform lesser me.  One.  Point.  Please. That.  The.  UK.  Cannot.  Do.  Without.  Being.  In.  The.  EU.  But.  From. The.  EEA.

I didn't believe it, and strolled right over to him confidently. Once I was right next to him I crumbled ""Oh my goodness it is you, one second"" I said. Not entirely sure how to react at this point...

I asked what he was doing 'here'. He had taken his son for skateboarding lessons. I said that it was great to see. 

I told him I had a massive interest and passion for politics, that I slated him online all the time, (Which he responded very well to) and asked could I have a quick conversation with him about politics and my experience with JSA and HB. He agreed...

I said I couldn't understand some of how the benefits system is structured... How I ended up out of pocket some weeks when I couldn't get overtime and that a 'jobseeker' would end up on more than me some weeks and I couldn't see how that was fair. I also told him how I had been rejected from many jobs including places like McDonalds and Morrisons, in which he was genuinely was surprised. He told me they were putting through a new system that he hoped would support better those who were trying to work and those who were not.

I thanked him for his time, asked for a photo and apologised to talk politics on his day off to which he replied ""no no thats fine"".

I then said 'Oh lastly I know skateboarders get a bad rep sometimes, but we're not all bad and there is a lot of good that comes from it.' 'I wouldn't be here if I thought that' he replied.

In all honesty I was surprised at how 'nice' he was. The first 2 minutes of conversation I could tell he was very uneasy, maybe thought I was going to happy slap him or something... Understandable. Was so surreal... No press and a couple of body guards in a skatepark with the PM. Not sure many people had the balls to speak to him, I'm pleased I did. His accent was very posh, even though I have listened to him on TV it was strange to hear it live.

true,[deleted],null,null,"If the UK were in the EEA it would have a veto on EU directives with regards to themselves (as the other EEA members do), it would have input via the EEA committee, the UK would have control over its quotas, fisheries and agriculture.  It would have its own seat at the World Trade Organisation.  Manufacturers would have to meet EU regulations to trade with them just as UK manufacturers have to meet Canadian or Australian regulations to trade with them.  Besides the extent the EU *tries* to influence EEA members is limited to the single market and such things as consumer rights.  Not a problem for the UK with the latter, if anything there's every reason why the UK should be exceeding EU expectations.  As for the former if the Germans, French and Scandinavians want to work out standardised packaging; let them have at it.  Great.  It's called delegation.  I'm sure they'll a sensible decision for all involved.  If UK manufacturers want to trade with them they'll adopt it.  If they don't, they won't.  It'll save the UK money, be cheaper to implement and still retain much more control and sovereignty than we would otherwise have with respect to other areas.  If they come up with something that doesn't sit well with the UK: they veto it for the UK.  What happens with the UK being part of EU is this, if the split 8% voting power of the UK doesn't support such an EU common market or consumer rights directive and it receives support anyway the UK, or any EU member, has no such EEA veto.  It's accepted regardless.

That the UK would be beholden is fallacy.       
The opposite is true.  

Not being part of the EU makes the UK far less beholden to European trade, fishing and agricultural policy whilst receiving all the real benefits of freedom of movement for capital, people, services and goods.  They wouldn't be beholden to a trade commissioner to negotiate trade either.  The UK would be able to decide whether they choose EU countries trading with the UK are held to their own higher regulations, their lesser regulations, or if the UK would accept EU regulations from EU countries.  How can giving away fishing and agricultural policy, a seat at the World Trade Organisation, duty and quota rights, trade negotiation as well as a NET €50+billion a year in return for something we already do and 'what size a carton to be sold in Europe should be', for a split 4-ways 8% voting share, without veto, be making the UK LESS BEHOLDEN?

true,UNITBlackArchive,tardis,,"Since the Doctor's return in 2005, he has been broken.   Nine was angry and bitter from the Time War.   Ten got too full of himself and by the end, swore off companions, with a complex that he made them all instruments of war.   Eleven has a guilt complex that he destroys lives.   This trend can't continue.   Eventually he will get so broken that no one will want to watch, and it gets harder and harder to justify him taking on companions.


So, I think there are two timelines.  One where River kills the Doctor and he dies.  And she gets put in Stormgate and that's that.   Then there is another where he is not broken and does not end up at Lake Silencio.  This Doctor is more happy-go-lucky.  More healed.  More adventuresome and fun-loving.  


I think River has been crossing in and out of timelines.  That's what the whole mirror thing is about.  When she kills the Doctor at Lake Silencio, that is her killing the best man she ever knew, but there is still another version out there from the alternate timeline.  This may also be why she isn't so concerned about being in Stormcage, because even though she killed him, she knows the other still lives.  She committed the act, but can be absolved of the guilt because the consequences never really happened.


So I think at the end, our Doctor will get killed, which will finally break River of her conditioning.  But we will continue on with the adventures of the other timeline Doctor who is more fun and outgoing.   This way, Moffat fulfills his promise that the Doctor dies, but also continues the show and allows him to write more fun stories where the Doctor isn't so maudlin and afraid to take on new companions and such.

true,busstopboxer,null,null,"I don't think it's an insurmountable problem, but it will take a good rotation policy. Pavlyuchenko, Huddlestone, Bassong, and maybe Corluka look like being the senior players to suffer most this year - even assuming a good season of fitness for all, I think the main outfield 16 of King, Gallas, Kaboul, BAE, Walker, Parker, Modric, Sandro, Lennon, Bale, Pienaar, Kranjcar, Adebayor, Defoe and VdV should be able to get plenty of game time, as long as Redknapp manages it well (though his history of successful rotation isn't exactly inspiring).

Kranjcar has looked good so far, and surprisingly has done so playing on the right. This is great news - he played so little last term because of a (justifiable) reluctance to play him anywhere but on the left - and he should get more opportunities as a result. Still want to see him given the chance to play the VdV second striker role alongside Ade, but this should be a good enough start to keep him happy and make sure we can keep hold of him.

I wouldn't worry about Dos Santos - he's clearly just making up the numbers while injuries are taking their toll - no way he's going to be pushing more important players aside; he's been too poor for too long and that doesn't look close to changing. Hopefully you're right and a couple of appearances before xmas will inspire some generosity from the boards of La Liga.

I think we're more likely to see a few more young players sent out on loan than quality players sold come January - Townsend, Livermore, Carrol, Falque for example. That's a complete midfield quintet right there whose biggest problem is that of their eight senior counterparts (Modric, Parker, Sandro, Huddlestone, Bale, Pienaar, Lennon and Kranjcar), only 3 are over 26, and 2 of that 3 aren't starters. We have a relatively young squad, and that's going to make it difficult for our even younger prospects to get the opportunities they need. We've been playing the loan system well recently - we're going to need to keep that up.

Finally, I'm not too worried about VdV - I like his attitude, and think it's a whole world away from that exhibited by Tevez. VdV just wants to play football - he was the main man, captain and first name on the team sheet at Ajax and Hamburg. Real didn't work out as he would have liked, and he wants to get back to what he had in the Eriedivisie and Bundesliga. He's a grown-up and he'll accept rotation - his biggest problem seems more to be that it's always him that Redknapp subs off if he wants to change things up a bit during a match. It's also always him that Redknapp looks to rest first if we're comfortable and can afford to change things. So he gets subbed a lot - i imagine that would be annoying. Just got to hope his fitness continues to improve and that begins to happen a bit less.",0,1317181224,null,0,false,0,c2n50vy,t3_kthad,t1_c2n50vy,t1_c2n38qs,1427656633,3,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,3

true,Ouro,null,null,"I did a regular degree at Cardiff and am now into the ‘third year’ of doing a CS degree with the OU.

Overall an OU degree compares well, however what is missing is regular contact with people actively involved in research in your field (don’t skip out on tutorials).

As others have pointed out self discipline is a major stumbling block is self discipline, without the pacing element of going to lectures it’s all too easy to put things off and then finding yourself racing to finish studying to be able to tackle an assignment. By it’s very nature OU students are going to have other commitments e.g. work and family, don’t let your studies always come last. e.g. In my case my studies had to take a back seat at times and have been spread out over 10 years, perhaps a little too attenuated as I feel because of that it hasn’t been a very coherent hole – next year in addition to probably doing the mysql course, Im intending to sit down a try to draw together what I know about Java, also learn C, php and perhaps python/perl etc. Do set aside some regular time when you study, indeed I’d recommend drawing up a timetable. Let others know you’re not available during those times.

Another issue is that while I found there is some coordination between lecturers at a regular university in assignment dates to avoid too much clashing, that doesn’t seem to be taken in to account by OU modules so you may find deadlines relatively close – however getting an extension generally isn’t too hard.

The assessment is tougher at the OU. While at Cardiff it wasn’t uncommon for some modules to have high practical/coursework components e.g. I seem to recall the finial mark from one module was 50% coursework %50 exam. Notably these two components where summative – meaning you could walk into an exam knowing that you’ve already passed and what you do here just polishes the final mark, a huge pressure relief. Not so the OU, it’s a little more complex than this, but essentially its the lower of your average assignment score and exam score that determines your final mark. It’s very common for OU students to do very well on the coursework and less well on the exam, thus it’s the exam that determines the result. That said I imagine that other regular universities use such a system.

You are essentially studying from a book rather than going to lectures, however the materials are bespoke and well written. If you go into your local regional center they’ll have copies of the module materials that you can take a look of. Overall I think the quality of the teaching is good, though obviously by its nature its not the same as going to university. As has been pointed out you may find some level 1 modules a bit trivial, however the OU has no entrance requirements (though each module does have recommendations on what you should probably know before embarking upon them), thus they’re needed to bring everyone up to speed.

Studying with the OU can be rather isolating, I don’t just mean missing out on the typical drunk student lifestyle, but rather than studying together with other students, often being able to ask one another for help on something you don’t understand etc you are on your own. However there are communities you can be part of, each module will have it’s own little website and forum (oh and there’s even an [OU subreddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/OpenUniversity) :p). And there are tutorials too, plus the tutors are there to help you, so if you find something puzzling they’re only an email/phone call away. 
You’ll find people’s views towards the OU and the quality of it’s degrees/students complex. I haven’t found anyone who has sneered at what I’m doing yet (though obviously it doesn’t compare to doing CS at Oxbridge, Warwick or some such). Indeed often people seem rather impressed if they learn you’re juggling studying with work.",0,1317191565,null,0,true,0,c2n6607,t3_kstzo,t1_c2n6607,t3_kstzo,1427657172,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

Which leads me to believe playing Kuyt now has its time and its place (for example he will be perfect for the derby at the weekend), but in my opinion a great work ethic is a brilliant thing to have, but it shouldn't get you in to the team, just on its own. 


However saying that, the right side of midfield is weak without Kuyt, as Henderson isn't a winger by an stretch of the imagination, but Kuyt, no longer has all the attributes that made him one of the first names on the teamsheet in years gone by.

The Cowshed on Whiteladies is really good, absolute top quality steak and it's lovely inside. They do a £10 deal in the week so long as you're out before 7 - that gives you a main and a drink. Kind of expensive without the deal though...

Casa Mia is absolutely exceptional, the only Michelin starred place in Bristol and totally deserving of it. They do the whole molecular gastronomy thing - it's also a lot less formal than some Michelin places can be.

Equally, anything you earn up to the JSA limit is taken straight off your benefit, so there's no incentive to work if you don't earn significantly more than 55/65 quid a week. Then, the work credit system is so convoluted that you might actually lose money by earning more.

David Cameron wouldn't be that surprised to hear about this, because benefit reform is at the top of the government's priorities.

Well how many hours do you work normally? It sounds like you could actually be claiming Jobseekers on top of your wage to reach a minimum standard income (currently at about £60 per week paid as £120 every 2 weeks, can be more depending on what you're previous income was). JSA is a system implimented to keep out of work people with a reasonable income whilst they look for work, if you are earning less than this and working plenty of hours then I'd say your employers are being very unreasonable, perhaps illegally so.

There are lazy people that abuse the system but don't discredit the system entirely, there are a lot of hardworking people who need that income to get by when between jobs.

true,Finchester,yorkshire,Yorkshire,"Hmmm sounds like you just had a bad experience with your Jobcentre when you say that there was discouragement to work. I've worked for the Citizens Advice Bureau and found that clients experience with the Jobcentre varied between the different branches. I got the impression that the busier ones in larger areas just don't give a shit about their clients and want to just rush them through the system which is certainly a bad thing and isn't helping the problem of high unemployment.

I do agree that coming from a part-time perspective earning less than Jobseekers can seem unfair and beg the question 'why bother work?' but there is still value in it, you'll find it far, far easier to get into higher paying employment than you would if you had no job at all and a sizeable gap in your employment.

I'd also say that for a lot of people the relatively low amount of income you can get from JSA and Housing Benefits is an incredibly big insentive to get back into work, especially for those those that have have come from fulltime work and families to look out for or just bills to pay.

Don't get me wrong though I do realise there are plenty of problems with the JSA. One big problem I have is that they actually offer little direct help themselves, most time a client comes to a jobseekers advisor with a request for help with jobseeking (such as interview techniques, CV building and whatnot) all the advisor can do is point them in the direction of another agency; if they offered these services themselves directly it would be far more convient and perhaps a bigger encouragement for the jobseeker... but then again these things cost money.",0,1317209304,null,0,false,0,c2n748d,t3_ktdvp,t1_c2n748d,t1_c2n70yy,1427657619,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

Housing benefit tapers off as you earn more, although I'm not sure of the cut-off. Also, if your income changes significantly you have to submit earnings every week, so that might be more hassle than it's worth. The tax credit system was built exactly to help out people earning about that level, but I'm not sure how it handles variability. Still, you should definitely have a go, imo.

I'm not convinced by the nuclear deterrent argument.  

First, it's based on game theory that assumes all sides are acting in a rational manner, which history shows wasn't the case.  People don't tend to act rationally when they're responding primarily to the fear of being attacked.  

Secondly, It didn't stop the Korean War, the Vietnam War or the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, for example, all of which were motivated by the underlying ""Capitalism vs Communism"" clash of ideologies.  Perhaps they're the ""minor proxy wars"" to which you refer, and although they might be ""minor"" in comparison to the mutually assured destruction of an all-out nuclear war, they certainly weren't minor in terms of duration, loss of life, financial outlay, etc.

My feeling (speaking as a non-historian with no real qualification to speak authoritatively on such matters) is that nuclear proliferation served to increase the tension in the Cold War, rather than doing anything to resolve it or even maintain the status quo.

true,specofdust,scot-Highlands,Pasty Faced Haggis Rider,"&gt;How would firing nukes at another country stop the armed forces that had already invaded Britain?

It wouldn't. The goal of strategic nuclear weapons is not to fight armed forces, it's to disincentivise the use of those armed forces in the first place. Of course you could use it as an area denial tool, nuke the UK in the event that any country takes the entire country - although I imagine it'd be a more effective deterrent to have the threat of having the invading country nuked, not the spoils of their war.

&gt;And how would we get to fire those nukes if that invading army had already taken over our military infrastructure?

You can't take over a submarine that you don't know the location of, and which is independent for months at a time. Our nuclear deterrent is independent and can function in the event of the total destruction of the rest of the UK armed forces, or even the entirety of the UK.

&gt;Nukes are no defence against invasion.

People say this, misunderstanding their use. They are not tactical weapons (at least, not in the way we use them). Having nukes is a little like having AIDS. AIDS won't stop anyone raping you, and AIDS won't help at all in a fight if they try to overpower you, but if everyone knows you've got AIDS, they're going to think twice before raping you, because if they do, something nasty will probably happen to them afterwards.

Nukes don't stop invasion, and nukes don't directly protect us, what nukes do is make us an unappealing target, they're the poison running through our veins that stops people wanting to eat us.

Whether UK nukes fall into the catagory of MAD or not is irrelevant, because if we ever have to use them it'll already be far too late for us. The point is, having them, makes it less likely that we would have need to use such massive amounts of power.",0,1317218970,null,0,false,0,c2n7w50,t3_ktwgv,t1_c2n7w50,t1_c2n7sbk,1427657985,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

That is why they are on submarines and why countries like North Korea can have nukes but no power. The value of nukes lies with the ability of a second strike. If you fuck with us then we will kill every motherfucking civilian in your country.

They make a great defense against invasion because they change the way the game works. If Germany had nukes at the end of WWII then why would it's leaders surrender?

Everyone understands that adverts are necissary as they're a major part of how cinemas make money. But 25 minutes of adverts takes the piss.

On a side note a pro-tip i learned recently; at cineworld (and probably other cinema chains too) the guys on the ticket gates have a list that says how long the adverts are, when they finish, when the credits role and when the credits end. If they claim that they don't they're lying and politely (they're just doing their job after all) push them for an answer. This way you can skip all the shit ads (and take that videos).

Iran doesn't even have a fully functioning program yet, but I'm sure their plan includes second strike capability ASAP.

true,D-Hex,yorkshire,Yorkshire,"I tend to side with strolls but let me add a few points 

a) The EEC and the EU were always seen as a political union by everyone when they were conceived. They were missold to the general British public as a economic union. The Europeans who came out of the WW2 swore not the repeat the same thing ever again and one of their ideas was economic and political integration that would solidify democracy, make mutual war impossible and stand up to the mighty Soviet Empire as well as counter the US. 

As the 1980s and 1990s progressed, most serious international analysts realised that there were going to be four massive power blocs that would dominate global trade and hard power. The EU, the US, the Soviets and the Chinese. Roll on the mid 1990s add a fifth - India. 

Just by looking at the population numbers strategists realised that economies of scale would crush the smaller countries and make them periphery states. Even when the Soviet bloc collapsed, you still had the US at 250 million and India/China at 1billion. Combined the EU brought in 450million. It could slot into the league. By GDP combined the EU outstripped all of them. This encouraged EU policy makers to go for quicker and harder union. 

b) Every political leader in the UK understood that. However, the Press , a lot of the financial institutions and prominent members of society were ""Atlantists"" who believed that the English language/Anglo-saxon cultural fit made the US the most important ally and were determined to closely integrate with US interests where possible. Also you have to remember the UK has taken a while to get used to the fact that we are no longer an Imperial power anywhere near the level of the 1940s, our collective memory and our culture still celebrates those times, but our political reality is that we are a middling state with middling resources - the public are yet to grasp that.  

c) The UK political classes basically sat on the fence so they could look like they weren't actually supporting the EU but could be important enough to be considered big players by the rest of the European Union. The sort of failed at both, the Public seems to think they sold out and the EU thinks we just don't want to be part of it.

Because Thatcher wanted to close unprofitable coal mines which at that time were being heavily subsidized by the taxpayer.

This was unpopular because people don't like to be forced to have to change jobs and learn new skills.  The alternative was to go on maintaining the fantasy that Britain had a viable coal industry at considerable taxpayer expense.

The argument is that by forcing through these unpopular measures that were painful in the short-term, she paved the way for the relative prosperity of the 90s.

In any case, she didn't do it because she was evil, she did it because she believed that ultimately it would help the country if taxpayers didn't have to prop up a failed industry.",0,1317228432,null,0,true,0,c2n96bs,t3_ktdvp,t1_c2n96bs,t1_c2n88ct,1427658590,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

It's neat to hear how ideas came about, how they were executed, how costumes were made, and all sorts of minutiae about the show.

Throughout the run of Confidential, I thought it would've been so cool to have had a similar show back when the original series was running.  At least towards the end.  Having that sort of documentation would've been amazing.

I guess if you have the attitude that country is just political and abstract you don't really have anything to be proud of, and you don't really deserve anything to be proud of.

Also, other nationalities get to be proud of their countries (in my experience Irish, Australians, Americans) why can't I?

This relies on having a friend (or sibling, or dog, or stuffed animal) you can talk to for a bit, but it's really effective. Not only does your ability to explain something indicate how thoroughly you understand the subject (if you have only a shallow understanding, you won't be able to explain it for someone who needs it put a slightly different way or needs side info to get it) but having to put it into words and diagrams in real time is really good for consolidating your thoughts. I know some have said that you just need to learn the exam criteria, and that's true to a great extent, but to really knock out those A's and A*'s a deeper understanding cannot hurt.

&gt; It is often stated that the Union Flag should only be described as the Union Jack when flown in the bows of a warship, but this is a relatively recent idea. From early in its life the Admiralty itself frequently referred to the flag as the Union Jack, whatever its use, and in 1902 an Admiralty Circular announced that Their Lordships had decided that either name could be used officially. Such use was given Parliamentary approval in 1908 when it was stated that ""the Union Jack should be regarded as the National flag"".

It messed with time because in the search to find a correct pilot, it created a time loop. Specifically when attempting to use an incompatible pilot.

Perception filters are used throughout the whoverse by many different races. The chameleon circuit on the Tardis is different. I'm not sure how you meant to tie that in.

It wasn't bigger on the inside. You can see that when the perception filter was lifted at the end of the episode.

It looks similar to the inside of the Tardis where there's a center control panel, but that's about it. I don't remember him saying that it was an attempt to specifically build a tardis, time machine yes and didn't see it in the article. Doesn't mean it wasn't but it also wouldn't be the first time another race has tried to build the technology. It wouldn't be that weird.

The Doctor wasn't the correct pilot, he was the only compatible pilot it had found.

In the article they also reference the race that built it as 'The Avatars'.

It was a filler episode. It would make sense if the Silence had something to do it, in the sense that they have been influencing the universe without anyone knowing. They might have salvaged it, who knows. I'm just not convinced it's all that important. Not every interaction he has with another alien race will tie into the over-arcing story.

Edit: I didn't mean to insult you but yeah, it didn't seem like you knew much about the Tardis. That's why I linked the Wiki.

Russel T. Davies and Steven Moffat are like Paul McCartney and John Lennon. One was a remarkably technically proficient writer in terms of craftsmanship whose approach was mostly intellectual, the other is undisciplined and self-indulgent albeit with an undeniably deep well of real talent whose approach is overwhelmingly sentimental. In both partnerships, the former grounded the latter's scattershot creativity in a base of compositional tightness and consistency, while the latter provided the former's technical proficiency with occasional touches of abstract brilliance. As with McCartney and Lennon, Moffat is the one who's amassed a near guru-like mystique and is most often called genius by his fans, while Davies goes criminally underappreciated.

Or if you prefer a more universal metaphor, Davies is like the responsible parent while Moffat is like the ""fun"" one. When you're a kid you take for granted the roof over your head and the food on your table, and you resent being reminded to do your homework and eat your vegetables. Meanwhile, the parent that slips you secret sweets under the table and lets you skip school to go with him to the movies or the arcade, all the while reminding you to ""Don't tell Mom"", is your favorite. Then the responsible one dies or leaves you for some reason and suddenly you're eating nothing but sweets and playing hooky every day and before you know it you've been expelled from school and evicted from your house and you're fat and sick and poor and stupid and living on the streets with nothing but fond yet rapidly fading memories of your former, stable, happy, normal life.

true,greensalt,null,null,"You really need to go and watch the new episodes from season 1 on. The Daleks aren't as visually menacing as many of the doctor's enemies, but they are far more dangerous. The latest story arcs with the 11th doctor have avoided Dalek episodes in general because there were so many episodes with them with the last two doctors. 

Watch season 1 from the first episode all the way through and you'll see a proper build up to how dangerous the daleks really are. They really show themselves properly in the final 2 episodes, but I strongly suggest that you don't skip straight to those 2 because they end a very good story arc that would be bad for you to miss out on. 

Suffice to say, each Dalek is a highly advanced tank with laser weapons that can destroy pretty much anything. The daleks also possess the most dangerous spaceships that can also travel through time (if you exclude the TARDIS). Three Daleks working in unison can easily destroy all life on Earth and could probably destroy all life on the Cybermen homeworld too. They look silly, but they also have true sense of perfection in their design. The Daleks were so dangerous that the Time War was primarily a war between the Time Lords and Daleks with a few other races involved. In the end, the daleks were so dangerous that the only way for them to be prevented from exterminating the universe was[spoiler](/s ""for the doctor to seal away all the most dangerous races involved in the time war indiscriminately."") If that's not dangerous, then I don't know what is. 

The Daleks are obviously not as immediately fear insipiring as The Silence, The Weeping Angels, or the Vashta Nerada, but those races are nowhere near as dangerous. Out of those 4 enemies, The Daleks are by far the most dangerous because their method of attack is to show up with 1000 warships in your atmosphere and invade with an army of unstoppable tank-aliens that can only be held back by 1 creature in the universe, The Doctor.

But regarding Lennon...
I think if you sat down and watched a lot of our goals (including build up) from last year, you might be surprised. This Premier League only video is a good start: http://vimeo.com/24052425

He's had a rough start to this year with the injury and some poor performances in the first few games (in which we got ravaged and basically everyone played like shit), but last year he was actually quite good.

I think tiny black wingers with wicked pace are like the black NFL quarterbacks of English football. So many cliches about not having a final ball or not having intelligence or being horrible decision makers, etc. People seem far more likely to crucify Lennon (as Ian Darke did on the US ESPN broadcast of the United game this year) for his decision making than someone like VDV, who can be equally wasteful. 

Really if you look at the majority of last year, his decision making was excellent, he played the correct final ball accurately, and he single handedly won us points with late equalizers or winners on multiple occasions. He tracks back (as wingers should) and is a very good defender and he works his ass off for however long he's on the pitch. It's funny that people slag his final ball so often that it's actually become underrated. He has some stuff in his locker that surprised the shit out of me only because all I hear from Spurs fans is how terrible his crossing is.

I'm certainly not saying he should start every single game, but he's definitely good enough. I think we can mix it up by putting VDV on the right and playing Walker for width, or playing Charlie and Lennon on that side as we've done the last few years.

In *AGMGTW* Rory (the Centurion) asks if they'd met yet; she says yes. 

Assuming that:

* Her timeline between telling Rory that she has met him and revealing herself at the end of the same episode **occurs in sync** with The Doctor's timeline (the battle on Demon's Run).
* She doesn't mean they've met as father/daughter.
* She doesn't mean they've met as Mels/Evil-River (in LKH).

Then she must reveal herself after TPO/TBB (her timeline), since that's the ""first"" time she mets Rory (which seems likely since as Cleopatra she doesn't seem to recognize the centurion... unless that's a coy spoilers ploy).

This makes sense as the first meeting between Rory and River also because the only other time they interact is during TIA/TDOTM, where they also seem to know each other.

And finally, TTOA/FAS has to happen **before** TPO/TBB because she warns The Doctor of those events.

true,LokianEule,mccoy,Time's Champion,"So when I heard the show had a ""classic"" series I decided I'd only watch the new stuff. But I ran out of new stuff and thought, maybe I can just watch the *best* of the classic stuff.

Well I didn't make it 10 minutes through The Three Doctors, not even five through Inferno, and Destiny of the Daleks wasn't good. I did watch the very first episode for education's sake, but I didn't get into classic Who until I saw Genesis of the Daleks. I suggest you watch it. Then I wanted to start from episode 1 and see all of them. It was hard because...well you can guess why. For someone whose always criticized any tv made before 1990, (and omg when I realized Star Trek :TNG was 80's) this was going to be hard. I wasn't sure I could make it through until I found this:

http://tachyon-tv.co.uk/newspost/unearthly_child/

It helped wean me into black and white 1st Doctor stuff. I started in the summer and anticipated months of watching. I braced myself and expected the worst. I got it. Every single sci-fi stereotype imaginable is in classic Who. Ships on strings, rubber suited men, hand puppet monsters green screened to like like giant monsters over a horizon...

BUT it was still good, and VERY interesting. You can see how the Doctor changes, and even the irritable first Doctor found a place in my heart by the end. AND if you can survive The Web Planet, The Dalek's Master Plan, and Galaxy Four, you can survive anything.

By then your standards are so low that as each Doctor progresses you see amazing leaps in awesomeness. Also, nothing will phase you by then. 

And there are still great episodes out there. The black and white 1966 (67?) first story of the second Doctor (Patrick Troughton), Power of the Daleks, is my absolute favorite Dalek story ever. AND it's reconstructed (some episodes are missing). There are still moments that make you laugh, and plots that despite their cheesy effects wow and surprise you.

For Amy and Rory, his death was long ago, but they will keep seeing him because dates in his past and their future coincide (think of ""Time-Traveler's Wife"").

true,friendlyhumanist,k9,K-9,"No worries, I wasn't insulted. I was just clarifying what I meant by my question about the name ""the Tardis."" I assume they existed before Susan named it, and I don't know if they had a name before that. But it wasn't your concern that it was a non-Sexy Tardis as I thought; instead, you think it's a non-Time Lord time machine.

I see your points but still disagree. I think I remember the Doctor saying it was a perception filter and not a chameleon circuit, which is a strike against ""Tardis,"" but I'll have to rewatch it. It looked bigger on the inside to me, large as it was on the outside. The Avatars (the name for the ""enemies,"" ie the autopilot that imitates multiple people) were looking at a bunch of people for a pilot, but couldn't find one. I think the language they/it use for the Doctor is different from the language used for the victims, but we'll have to check. It was a filler, written for a comic, but that doesn't mean they couldn't make it relevant for the story arc.  According to the Wiki, the Doctor acknowledged the connection between the ships in Day of the Moon, so Time Lord Tardis or not, it's somewhat relevant.

Anyway, that's all pretty much irrelevant, because I'm pretty sure the Doctor says it's a Tardis explicitly, or at least an attempt at one. The article says this:

&gt; The Doctor, after first seeing the ship, called it ""someone's attempt to build a TARDIS"".

I remember him saying that. In the end, we'll just have to find the clip. I'll check when I get some time.

Whether the ship is built by Time Lords or not, it's something like a Tardis, and therefore something of a big deal. It could have to do with the Silence, or with the Time Agents. It might have to do with whoever controlled the Tardis and blew it up. It would fit in with the Valeyard theory that's floating around. If they don't use this, it's a waste.

true,swinegums,flair7,,"I think you're over playing the criticism significantly and seemingly aiming squarely at THFC when the roots of the problems lies in years of underfunding. You can't blame THFC for the riots or for the appalling lack of investment in infrastructure in the area. 

I can't imagine any other Premier League club (or business for that matter) being willing to fund the infrastructure that was being demanded of them by Haringay Council. It's been clear for a very long time that the tube (15+ minute walk away) and train (tiny station, infrequent trains) were wholly inadequate for transporting 30000+ people to and from a match but the council were equally intransigent and insistent that the club should foot the majority of the bill for improving the transport links. 

Don't talk blithely about greed as though it isn't the EPL's very basis - any fan knows full well that a new stadium is a necessity if Tottenham want to consistently compete as a top 4/CL club. Of course Levy is going to look at the most viable option for the club's future - and if that means pursuing the Olympic stadium, then that's what he's going to do. 

THFC is a PLC. Is it attractive that Levy is using the increased leverage he now finds as a result of the riots? No. Is it exciting that this might finally mean we break ground on a new stadium and stay in the are? Undoubtedly yes. 

If you want to find someone to criticise over the poverty in the Haringay area I'd suggest you look to the governemnt - not a football club.

true,[deleted],null,null,"While I am pro-Moffatt, I don't dislike your post because it puts him in in the more negative light. I dislike your post because I feel you really stretched for that analogy and it doesn't really work. RTD and Moffatt have different styles. I greatly prefer Moffatt, not because I think he is some guru or magical genius but because (and this is purely my personal opinion, on my own terms. I'm not a poncy person who thinks I understand much of anything at all or talks in magical polysyallbles about the beauty of structure in the post modern idiom or anything) *his Who is the Who I wanted to watch when I was seven years old and dreamed about a day when the show was grittier and had amazing effects* and that's something that RTD was never really able to pull off for me. And, possibly chilidishly, *that is what I really really really wanted to see when they brought the show back in 2005*. So, while I *like* RTD's era quite a bit (Doctor Who has been my favorite show since 1986 and always will be), I *love* Moffatt/Smith in a way that I *never* was able to love RTD/Eccleston/Tennant. And for the record, I think Moffatt as a producer is *more* consistent than RTD. I think you are cherry picking the best episodes in your mind from RTD while singling out the worst from Moffatt (not that you went into any specifics whatsoever, which is another reason I dislike your post). Yes, Victory of the Daleks was kind of weak and, while I personally loved it, I can see how a NuWho-only fan would dislike Curse of the Black Spot (since you wouldn't understand all the awesome ways it harkens back to Golden Age and base-under-siege-era Who), but balance that out with Fear Her and the Daleks/Manhattan two-parter and the stinker ending to Series 3, and, yeah, sorry, Moffatt consistently pulls out better stuff, imo.

And as for fanwank, Moffatt does fanwank *very* subtly and he does do it, I guess more often. But when RTD did it he did it TOO big. School Reunion, the Series 4 finale, omg. Moffatt has done exactly *one* full episode of fankwank, The Doctor's Wife, and it is the most exquisite piece on not-over-the-top fanwank that I have ever watched five times the day it aired.

Though when it comes to the Asgard, the reason that they were dying out was because the entire species, in order to be immortal, kept cloning their bodies and transplanting their consciousness into the new bodies. This process over the millenniums had degraded their genome and so they turned to the humans of Earth to do research on them, as the current day humans were remarkably similar to the ancient Asgards and the Asgard hoped that the key to their survival would be found in the humans genetic code.

In fact during one episode they showed that the Asgard found and were studying an Asgard that was frozen in ice from like 30,000 years ago or so that looked very much more human like than Asgard like, with which they hoped to find a solution to their cloning degradation problem.

So who's to say we're currently not in the original timeline that's being screwed up and the one all three left behind at the facility was the original one?

It would make sense. Think about it:

- The Doctor/Rory went into the room where time passes as normal. (A)
- Amy went into the room where time passes faster than normal. (B)
- The Doctor/Rory traveled into the faster time stream (B) leaving (A) behind.
- The Doctor/Rory/Future Amy in (B) brought the Younger Amy from (A) to (B), leaving nobody in (A) and perhaps the original timeline we're accustomed to.
- Everyone (and us) are now following events as they occur in timeline (B).

So by leaving behind the original timeline, we're now in a parallel, misshapen timeline where events happened far differently and things have turned for the worse.


I suspect because of this, The Doctor will indeed die. But it will be (B)'s version of The Doctor that bites the dust and (A)'s Doctor will arrive after and explain he had to stow away in (A) until the exact moment in time where he could jump over and recover (A)'s original Amy/Rory from (B).

Meaning we all then jump back to (A) where The Doctor, and original, is still alive and the fixed point in time of The Doctor's death still happened only occurring in (B) instead.

true,MtHammer,smith,Smith,"In my opinion, the second half of the season has been far stronger than the first. 

*The Impossible Astronaut* and *Day of the Moon* (particularly the former) were excellent.  So was *The Doctor's Wife*, though its growing cult status is bringing it to the brink of being incredibly over-rated.  *The Curse of the Black Spot* is pretty universally regarded as being below average, though. *The Rebel Flesh*/*The Almost People* was a really underwhelming two-parter bolstered by a fantastic twist ending.  And *A Good Man Goes to War* was quite good, but also felt very rushed.

On the other hand, *Let's Kill Hitler* was a lot of fun, and is possibly the most quotable episode this side of *The Pandorica Opens*/*The Big Bang*.  *Night Terrors* has probably been the weakest episode the second half of the season, but I was actually surprised at how much I ended up enjoying it.  I'd easily take it over either the pirates or flesh episodes.  Meanwhile, *The Girl Who Waited* was, by your own admission, fantastic, while *The God Complex* was one of the best deconstructions of the Doctor's psyche that the series has done.  I'll admit that *Closing Time* probably just comes down to personal preference, depending on how much you enjoyed *The Lodger*.  I happened to love both of them.  Obviously it remains to be seen how well the finale turns out, but I'm pretty optimistic.

In my opinion, season 6 (particularly the second half) has gotten a lot of criticism that all basically stems from one point - Moffat didn't allocate enough time for an in-depth enough discussion of why the Doctor, Amy, and Rory weren't still looking for the baby after the events of *Let's Kill Hitler*.  It's been pretty well established that you can't go back and change events that have become part of your own personal time line and that fact, combined with the fact that Amy and Rory essentially spent their entire lives with their daughter (not to mention that they were kind of blindsided by her pregnancy) is enough closure for me heading into the finale.  But Moffat never really took the time to lay out any of that reasoning.  He basically alluded to it in a throwaway line and then the season moved on almost like nothing had happened, and I think it annoyed* a lot* of people.

true,TX1138,pertwee,Pertwee,"I will have to disagree with you about RTD's era being intrinsically more 'intellectual' than Moffat's era. RTD's Who was very much focused on big emotional moments, often at the expense of the plot. This results in episodes such as *Boom Town*, *Doomsday*, *Last of the Time Lords*, *Journey's End* and *The End of Time*, where Russell repeatedly writes himself into corners, and is forced to resort to enormous cop-out resolutions to otherwise compelling situations. Scenes like Pete/Mickey/Jackie being able to teleport just in time to save Rose/Sarah Jane from the Void/Daleks, Floaty-Glowing Messiah Doctor, the Doctor-Donna's 'magical keyboard' solution to the Reality Bomb that serves only to reduce both Davros and the Daleks to a laughing stock, Donna's unintentionally hilarious mind-explosion powers that adds nothing to the plot and raises a huge number of safety concerns, and the previously unhinted-at third target that allows the plot to resolve itself without the Doctor being forced to make any moral judgement call whatsoever from *The End of Time: Part 2* are all symptoms of a writer who appears to use plot in order to string together his (admittedly amazing) big emotional character moments.

One of Moffat's greatest strengths (IMO) is his ability to lay out a strong, cohesive plot, with elements that all tie together in order to create a satisfying resolution. For instance, *A Christmas Carol* sets out a number of key plot points;

1. There is crippled Star Cruiser that needs saving from dangerous fog.
2. The planet is inhabited by fish that swim in this fog.
3. There is a flying shark that has swallowed part of the Doctor's sonic.
4. The fog is controlled by Kazran's weather machine using sonic waves.
5. Abigail's singing resonates with the ice-crystals that make up the fog.

All these parts, entertaining in their own right, go on to form the resolution to the story. This can also be seen in many of Moffat's other stories, but one thing of *critical* importance is that many of the plot elements are now forming over the period of *2 whole series*  as opposed to a 45-90 minute story. As such, the hugely emotional character moments that were such a large part of the RTD era now often find themselves attached to key plot points, and are thus treated with less emotional fanfare. I've seen people complain that Moffat's stories 'aren't as good as they used to be', but I've always argued that the beauty of a Moff-penned story is the way in which the various elements come together to form the conclusion. As of now, we have yet to have witnessed the conclusion to Moffat's epic 26-part serial, and are being forced to judge an incomplete story. It's as futile as watching parts 1-4 of *Inferno* and criticizing the story for being wholly unsatisfying. 

**TL;DR:** Davies stories tend to be focused around amazing character moments strung together by wafer-thin plot. Moffat stories (of which Series 5 &amp; 6 are a part of) tend to be focused around a strong plot, with smaller character moments that revolve around plot points.

Doctor Who, on the other hand, has an episode for every occasion.  It does humor, drama, romance, mystery, adventure, anything you could want.  It has amazingly cheesy, campy episodes, it has amazingly poignant touching episodes, it has swashbuckling, fun episodes, it has tense, dramatic episodes, and everything in between.  Yet it all still feels true to itself.  The show's tonal shift rarely, if ever, feel jarring or out of place.  It's just so damn versatile. 

I do love both shows, though.

true,michael_ellis_day,null,null,"Yeah, this.  Moffat and McCartney are both well versed in the formal structure of their respective fields, and knowingly play with and/or subvert those structures to surprise and entertain their audience, but can also be *too* intellectual, to the point where they can sometimes seem detached from the emotions in their work.  Davies and Lennon were much more concerned with gut feeling and emotion than with formal structure, and tended to wing it -- sometimes producing spontaneous gems, and sometimes collapsing into a hopeless muddle.  

I'm tempted to draw another parallel with Davies and Lennon both being really fixed on the relationship, or lack of same, between a mother and a child and making that the emotional core of their most passionate work, but that might be overdoing it.

When I watched *The End of Time Part II* for the first time, 10's last words provoked a big reaction, but it was equal parts annoyance and sympathy. I loved Tennant and thought that he was absolutely amazing in the role, but honestly I was also looking forward to seeing what the next Doctor would be like. (I catching up to this point, by the way, around when season six had just begun, so I'd been hearing nothing but how spectacular Smith was from friends and the anticipation was killing me.) So to go out with the line ""I don't want to go,"" I was torn between wanting to keep 10 forever and wanting to put him out of his misery as quickly and humanely as possible.

I agree with what some other people have said so far--that the line highlights 10's flaws and weaknesses and fears--but I still don't know that that's the way we want to leave him. The regeneration of 9 was much more positive, hopeful, and life-affirming, all traits that I believe the Doctor should ultimately embody. As an individual character, it makes sense to be so vulnerable in the face of what is perceived to be an extinguishing of sorts and from a narrative point of view, I know that everything is going to be all right. But the Doctor has also been a bastion of reassurance, and that's the moment that I needed reassuring from him most.

So there's a tension, I think, between wanting to fulfill an individual character's emotional arc and wanting to be able to deliver an overall story arc that satisfies and transitions to the next thing. RTD opted for the former, which is acceptable; I've heard somewhere that if the 10th Doctor hadn't been Tennant, most of the story and character arcs would have been significantly different. So it makes sense to write a good-bye that is written for that specific character and actor, but I think that it still could have been done differently. 10 is alone when he regenerates but the viewer is still there, after all.

I think I read somewhere that an alternate line was considered for 10's good-bye: ""Don't forget me."" This would have been so good. I imagine 10 alone still, drifting in orbit around the planet and gazing into the heart of the TARDIS; camera angle pans around to focus on his face and he delivers the line directly to the audience: ""Don't forget me."" I'm a sucker for emotional cliches, and I think that would have be so chilling. It lets 10 have his moment of vulnerability, afraid that he will be subsumed and forgotten when the new man comes along, but it also delivers an imperative to the viewer, a last wish that we will certainly respect. It is a fitting send-off for both the character and the actor.

I suspect it could have been very, very good.

In short, Tony gets large amounts of money from certain businesses ('consulting fees') and the Israeli government and lobbyists. The documentary can't prove bias, but does show that there are **loads** of **very** convenient concurrences between things he's been involved with and interests his financiers have.


Moreover, there is real (what I think is) hypocrisy between his actions towards palestinians being cocks (inflammatory language to Israel, weaseling around full-condemnation of terrorist attacks, their recent UN statehood bid) and Israel (full support of occupied site-settlement, suspension of Palestinian law, effective embargoes on goods). 

The documentary shows a number of instances where he has refused to criticize israeli settlements, saying that he will do so (in private). The show then talks to the Israeli settlers he would have talked to in private, who reveal no such actions taken by him.

The fanbase did show initial vehement resistance to Matt Smith. (I was kind of one of them, but more over the fact how young the Doctor's gotten than because I had issues with Smith himself) 

And yes, the fangirls' 'bring Tennant back' cries reached the heavens and painted the internet red. 

But I like to think that by now Matt Smith has persuaded most people otherwise. He is really, really a great Doctor. One of the greatest, maybe. (I've just reached Tom Baker's classic episodes so I can't speak for all the old Doctors too) 

The line itself? It was heartbreaking, I agree. And maybe they could've toned it down a bit, but at least I'm glad that the process of regeneration is slowly being developed as an emotion-packed experience too. I never understood how the previous Doctors took it so well, psychologically.

Lee Mack is on a show called 'Not Going Out' that is pretty funny, he does good stand up as well. More sitcom-y than the others I listed but still worth watching.  

'QI' cannot be recommended enough as Stephen Fry and Alan Davies are in every episode, with appearances from David Mitchell, Rob Brydon, Lee Mack, Bill Bailey, Jo Brand, Rich Hall, the list goes on.

 If you want a good mystery show, 'Jonathan Creek' is pretty sweet, it is what Alan Davies is known for, a Magician's assistant (comes up with illusions/mechanisms) who investigates crimes with an odd element to them. 

'Spaced' is an excellent comedy series with Simon Pegg (Shaun of the Dead), has a great soundtrack.

'Misfits', a kick-ass show, its about teens on probation doing community service who get superpowers, some quite unconventional. Awesome mix of comedy/drama/action. also with a great soundtrack. Highly recommended. 

'Inbetweeners' is a pretty fun show, comedy about high schoolers, lots of hilarious moments. 

'Magicians' is a movie mentioned here in the comments, with David Mitchell and Robert Webb, and I can vouch for its hilarity. 

'Numberwang' is an awesome math quiz show with a great host and a long history.^(just_kidding)

That being said, I loved that line at that time. I went through 2 or 3 years of Tennant. I wasn't phased when Eccelston died, but Tennant helped me discover a show that's been on since 1963. However, before I saw the 11th Doctor I fucking hated the concept of Matt Smith. I hated how he was going to change and everything he was going to be different. I hated seeing the doctor fear death for 4 specials in a row, and then say he hates dying. I hated how the new Doctor was going to be younger. 

And then I saw the 11th hour and realized I was an idiot. I love Matt Smith now, and I completely agree with 'that guy with glasses.'

If the character who will change actors, hates the fact he is going to change actors, then the fans who like the actor will hate the next actor. This is common sense. Death only meant changing actors. He was whiny and sad and annoying.

Turns out... I'm kinda digging it now.  They brought back the lead actress's lovable nature without cheapening it, they brought some of them back to Britain (much needed), and the American's became less like big whiney babies and more useful.

Children of the Earth - I agree, complete masterpiece.

Moral Dilemma and Human Nature is what Torchwood does best.  That and quirky humor.  Fun fun fun.

The way I see it, this scene once again shows the dick-side of Russell T Davies writing style.. Every once in a while he likes to pull a dick-move like this, and alienate the fans.. No, more like intentionally insult the fans..

He must think it's clever or something, but it's not.. It's more like desperate writing, that doesn't fit.. -_-

More proof that RTS is a dick? He pulled a similar asshat move with the ending of the Torchwood: Children of Earth series.. What he made Jack do at the ending of that, was totally out of character and monstrous. Jack would NEVER do something like that, the thought wouldn't even have occurred to him.. Heck, no (good-side) character in the Doctor Who Universe would.. They always find better options than THAT, that's part of the POINT of it all!

So yeah.. I couldn't be happier that RTS is no longer writing Doctor Who episodes.. I suppose there was a point when he'd simply been writing for the show for too long, and overstayed his abilities.. So the only ""clever"" moves he had left, in his mind, was shit like that.

Don't get me wrong, he had plenty of GOOD stuff too.. But I'm glad he's handed the torch off..

There is too much pressure on him to perform and he isn't exactly known to thrive under pressure. Bringing on Drogba at this point would have made the Valencia players think twice before breaking. Also, the Malouda-Drogba-Anelka pairing is much, MUCH better than the Malouda-Anelka-Kalou pairing, IMO.

For me, if I see a flag out somewhere I usually think ""Oh the bloody football must be on again"", but I have seen flags hanging out for months. Incidentally, I am a rugby fan, and even with the World Cup on, there is not the urge to fly the flag like there is with football. 
 So do I think they are more racist? Not really, but I do find myself agreeing with another poster who associated it with Sun readers. I question myself as to why though, because yes people should be able to fly a flag if they want to, to support a team or because they are proud to be British. I don't feel the urge to hang a flag out of the window at all, if I was forced too, would I feel comfortable with it? No because I would worry that people thought I was being racist, particularly as I live just on the outskirts of a council estate. And yes, sadly, there are quite a few of the ' I am not racist but...' types here too, but I consider it more to do with ignorance than from being from a poorer or working class. 


Patriotic always seems a strange word to me, people would associate it with being proud of your country, the heritage, the history, supporting the troops etc. I adore my country, it is a beautiful place to live and we live in luxury in terms of health and free speech here, but I am not patriotic in the slightest. I don't get a feeling of pride when I see the UJ, or when I see troops going off to war ( I feel anguish for them if anything), I am not totally proud of our history, we have been guilty of so many crimes in the past it is difficult to be proud, and I regard the Royal family as expensive parasites. 


On the subject of immigration, I do not support unbridled immigration because it is unsustainable in this climate, nor to I support arbitrary caps on immigration either. But immigration includes people from all countries, and ethnicities, for me it is about people not race.

Using the ""corporations are bound only to seek profit"" maxim then yes, every business in THFC's position would seek to minimise its S106 contributions and would use the media and brinkmanship to do this. And you're right to say that every EPL club would do the same. 

But if it's easier to ignore the game and label THFC nothing but a business, then the same rules should apply to them as do to everyone else. It's worth bearing in mind that as well as a stadium, the NDP also includes [200 homes and a 150-room hotel](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northumberland_Development_Project). It's a property project.

You're absolutely right that the underfunding of the area is something that has Governmental roots. However, S106 is one of the mechanisms Councils nationwide can use to put this right. 

S106 is a tax. It's fairly unique though, as it's a negotiable one. If you were to build 100 new homes as an add-on to a leafy suburb, the Council would have a look at the increase in services it would need to provide and whether the infrastructure can support it. It then demands that you, the developer, assist it in improving these so that the standards are maintained or improved for all in the area, existing residents and new. Frequently this will be things such as a new block of classrooms at the local school, improvements to the road junction you'll be adding cars to, etc. The public square that's being proposed as part of the NDP is another example, which we in the biz would call a 'public amenity'.

As an extreme, [the Nine Elms project in Battersea is having to partially fund an extension to the Northern Line](http://northernlineextension.com/).

I don't believe it's THFC's fault that Haringay is deprived. But I do believe its partially their problem to solve - as it would be for any other property developer in their position. 

This is all that's being asked of THFC, that it pays its taxes.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt; It's just Moffat's shitty writing

I always feel weird reading this. ""The Eleventh Hour"" was the best single post-regeneration story I can think of - or at least easily the best since ""Spearhead from Space"". It re-introduces the Doctor and introduces *two* companions in a story full of ideas (admittedly, some of them re-used from Moffat's previous ones) and has him cleverly save the world using modern technology in the space of *twenty minutes* without his TARDIS or his sonic screwdriver. It then has the ""I am the Doctor"" speech, the first ""Bow ties are cool"", the ""I can fix that"" bit and the first utterance of ""Mad man with a box"".

He's since written many good episodes, including the sucker punch ""Pandorica Opens"" and the one that made me cheer like a mad man, ""Day of the Moon"". Yes, his last two outings were only decent but at least they juggled around ideas. Not to mention that he wrote the best episodes of every series Russell T Davies ever produced. He has four Hugos. **Four**. This is a man of immense talent and I know that some Doctor Who fans take issue with the direction he took the show, but that's the show, people: it's about change. There have been at least [ten versions](http://io9.com/5833466/10-totally-different-tv-shows-that-doctor-who-has-been-over-the-years)	 of it.

Moffat's ""bad"" episodes constitute of having too many ideas in one go, and River's magical transformation in ""Let's Kill Hitler"". On the other hand, you have a man like Russell T Davies, whose idea of character development is having Rose Tyler crying on a beach in one episode only to have her having touting a gun in her next appearance, with no way to trace how she went from one to the other in between. He did a good job with Mickey, or at least he did until he inexplicably married her to Martha, but at some point he lost the ball with Rose and she became a forced love interest with a cartoonishly big gun. This is besides the farting aliens, blowjob-giving tiles, weak Weeping Angels knock-offs and most of *The End of Time*.

While even Russell T Davies produced the odd good episode (including the great ""Midnight""), he doesn't hold a candle to Steven Moffat.

However, you get an Orange Wednesday advert right before the start of every single film.

The problem is that they only change adverts every 3 months or so, which means I see each one at least 30 times before they do a new one.

It is such a simple one to fix as they now have a pretty big back catalogue of Orange Wednesday adverts. Just rotate them.

Anyway, I think Russell T Davies is a good showrunner, but a bad writer. Honestly, I do, and this coming from some a fan of his *The Second Coming*. He works *deus ex machina* into his stories (quite literally in ""The Parting of the Ways"" and ""Boom Town"") and forces relationships that maybe could do with a bit more subtlety. He does have the occasional brilliant moment (""I'm burning up a sun just to say goodbye"", ""Gridlock"", ""Midnight"") but generally speaking, his output is more miss, less hit.

People have been hating on Russell T Davies forever, maybe since ""The End of the World"" first came out with its Britney Spears bit. People always hate on show runners. The difference is that with someone like Moffat, you can make a case for them being excellent because they get TV Moment of 2005, four Hugos, etc. Russell T Davies's biggest contribution - and this is a huge one, I might add - is bringing *Doctor Who* back in such a big way.

So we gave him a single episode and again he wrote the best episode of the series. So then we gave him a Doctor-lite episode, and *again* he wrote the best episode of the series!""

Also, the Asgard refrained from much human experimentation, due to not believing that the ends justified the means. The Asgard doing the human experiments was a rogue.

However, in the Pegasus galaxy, there was another group of rogue Asgard who did believe that the ends justified the means, and they continued experimentation on humans, with some success. However, Atlantis was cancelled so we never find out more about this group.

I started watching Doctor Who at the beggining of Chris Eccleston (Man, I miss that shit eating grin) and though I was sad to see him go, I loved the role as played by David Tennant. He was perfect! He was brilliant, yet had his faults, eccentric, yet grounded, kind, yet filled with rage. He was The Doctor, and still remains the face that comes to mind whenever someon invokes that mighty title.

Matt Smith has done an excellent job of winning my approval (for whatever that's worth) as the Doctor, but that is in part due to how the character has been played in response to that phrase; ""I don't want to go."" I see Smith as a man unsure of his surroundings, unsure of himself. He's as much mad as he is brilliant, as if he's lost inside a mind to vast, constantly covering over his doubts with his many quircks. His ""___ are cool"" only reinforces this view for me, as he is always trying to redefine who and what he is in relation to the universe around him. He knows who he's been in the past, but he doesn't seem sure of who he's supposed to be now.

All that said, he pulls through every episode, and with aplomb when it comes time to cut the wire. That's what I think reconciled me to Matt Smith as the Doctor, he may doubt who he is supposed to be, but when it actually matters, when the Doctor is needed, he realizes that he's been the Doctor all along, and he just needed to release his fear of failing, to let go of his shortcomings and just be brilliant.",0,1317298183,null,0,false,0,c2nh5sw,t3_kuoj6,t1_c2nh5sw,t3_kuoj6,1427662478,2,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,2

The major flaw with all theories of this type is that the trope ""Oh, it was a rule imposed by the Time Lords..."" is false. It is made totally clear in the classic series that it was in fact a physical limit and not a law or a rule. Basically when a Time Lord graduates the Academy (Not all Gallifreyans are Time Lords. Has to be earned!) and is given his/her regenerations, he/she is given 13 lives (1 original life + 12 regenerations) total by that process and the ability cuts out without outside intervention at that point. 

The regeneration limit, however, has been circumvented, not by the silly throwaway line in SJA, but by the fact that River gave her remaining lives to the Doctor. This leaves open the possibility open that he was given lives by other Time Lords during the Time War (which was never seen onscreen. convenient!). So, hell, maybe he wasn't just being coy when he said ""507"" in SJA. Maybe that's the number of lives he now has as a result of destroying the rest of his race and he somehow inherited their remaining lives, as we now know that it is possible for such a transfer to occur.

Hey, thanks for prompting me to think about this. Now I have a response that reconciles pretty much everything for the next person who seems to have it all ass backwards.

edit pasted from my response below regarding River:

River isn't the product of a natural genetic process. She is the product of human natural genetics and Time Lord technology. Actually makes more sense that way if you think about it :D Also don't forget the Silence tinkered with fetusRiver. Just because her biology was compatible with regeneration doesn't mean she would have had the ability if the Silence hadn't interfered in her development.

Scotland does not vote on military matters, it is not within the Scottish government's remit to take part in defence decisions. I'm just arguing, how about we take that one level higher up, and assign it purely to the EU in order to maximise effectiveness of spending.

Secondly, as to voting power, I think voting power based on statehood is fundamentally flawed and old fashioned, but I suppose your thinking lies behind the most common objections to the EU. You seem to see it as a collection of 27 nations, I see it as a collection of 500,000,000 people who happen to belong to various countries. Voting done by population is (imo) the obviously fair and democratic way to carry out selection of decision makers within the EU.

&gt; Britain is still a Christian country, but the drift towards secularism continues.

Will Britain still be a Christian country even when the pews are all empty and the number of non-believers outstrip Christians? And why do people continue to conflate non-belief or apathy with secularism? Secularism does not require one to be a non-believer which something that the majority of religious people who 'fear' secularism should really understand. Secularism actually protects their religious rights.

&gt; The headline figures suggest that the United Kingdom remains a predominantly religious and majority Christian country. Almost seven in ten (68.5%) identify themselves to researchers as Christians - far more than the 15% who regularly attend church.

[Checking the source](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/dcp171778_227150.pdf) (page 6), the question that was asked was this:

&gt; 'What is your religion, even if you are not currently practising?'

This is a leading question and as such the data is not to be trusted - in fact we should dismiss it to a certain degree. The wording of this particular question is *so* important. The [BHA had a massive campaign about it before the Census last year](http://census-campaign.org.uk/), because this question skews the reality of the situation. Consider the [British Social Studies survey](http://www.humanism.org.uk/campaigns/religion-and-belief-surveys-statistics/british-social-attitudes-survey) conducted before the last election:

* In Britain, those who profess no-religion have risen from 31% to 43% between 1983 and 2008. In 2009, this was found to have further risen to 51%.

* Conversely, in 1983 66% identified as Christian, in 2008 the number was 50%. In 2009, this further declined to 43%.

The discrepancy in numbers seems to lie with the same problem the census has: How the question is phrased. The census question might have ""No religion"" as the top option, but the question is/was ""What is your religion?"" [We know this wording is a problem as it has been demonstrated to collect incorrect data](http://www.humanism.org.uk/campaigns/religion-and-belief-surveys-statistics): 

&gt; *In [a poll conducted by YouGov](http://www.humanism.org.uk/_uploads/documents/results-for-british-humanist-association-census-11-03-noscottish-np.xls) in March 2011 on behalf of the BHA, when asked the census question ‘What is your religion?’, 61% of people in England and Wales ticked a religious box (53.48% Christian and 7.22% other) while 39% ticked ‘No religion’.*

&gt; *When the same sample was asked the follow-up question ‘Are you religious?’, only 29% of the same people said ‘Yes’ while 65% said ‘No’, meaning over half of those whom the census would count as having a religion said they were not religious.*

It makes perfect sense: If you ask people ""What is your favourite football team?"" you are leading the question and assuming they have one. This is compounded in a multiple choice test when there is no option for ""I do not have a favourite team."" The correct question should be ""Do you have a religion?"" but the government and census teams have refused to replace the question even though it will give more accurate data. It's worth noting that that question could easily slip in before the current question, even though 'religion' means different things to different people. It would still give a clearer indication of the situation.

&gt; This picture of stability may be something an illusion, however. ... in 2009-10, the figure for Christian affiliation was 71.4%... A movement of 3% from a Christian identity to a non-religious one in a single year is potentially a dramatic one.

I might be reading this incorrectly, but the author seems to be implying that *this* study can't be right because the *old* one gave different data. Why does he choose one over the other, when other studies have clearly shown the number to be far lower?

&gt; Another possibility is that younger people are simply more honest - that older respondents grew up at a time when to admit to having no religion was less socially acceptable than it is today and have retained a habit of pretending to belief.

Also most young people having avoided much of indoctrination, don't feel that they are Christian as such. I would imagine that, even though 1/3 of all schools are faith schools and collective worship is still required by law, children simply haven't had it drummed into them that they ""are Christians"". Also consider the confusion as to whether or not people identify as religiously or culturally Christian: My grandmother has not been to church for decades. Probably only a handful of times in half a century. She insisted that on her census she put ""Chrsitian/Baptist"". Why? ""That is my religion."" But you don't go to church ever or pray or read the bible... or even apparently believe in the Christian god...? ""That is my religion."" (yeah, anecdote != data).

That is a very important aspect to consider, but it ties in with the dodgy question phrasing which this author seems to overlook.

&gt; The most likely scenario, however, has to be that Christianity is indeed contracting in Britain at a steady and observable rate, 

Bingo. Exactly what the [BHA](http://www.humanism.org.uk/shop/62) and the [NSS](http://www.secularism.org.uk/about.html) have been saying for years.

&gt; a long-term trend that has not been altered significantly by the increasing profile of religion in the media, politics and public debate over the past ten years.

Which is why, as the BHA and the NSS campaign, religion should not have such a large influence in daily life as a matter of course, *particularly* not in politics.

&gt; The secularisation of society does not seem yet to have reached a tipping point at which attachment to Christianity - however notional - collapses.

Again, just because someone is a secularist does not mean they cannot be a Christian. Secularism is concerned with keeping religion out of politics and similar. This is not something to be sniffed at: [Tony Blair has gone on record to state](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/4772142.stm) that he turned to his faith to decide whether or not he should invade Iraq - He believes his god was behind him. [George Bush said the same](http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2005/oct/07/iraq.usa). Why is it that it is acceptable for a democratically elected man to ""leave it up to his god""  to decide whether or not to start an armed conflict? Isn't that a little bit screwed up? Some might say ""No"" but consider how you might feel if Blair or Bush had been in a minority religion:  What if Blair had been a Scientologist (even though it is not a religion) and believed Xenu wanted him to do it?

&gt; Lack of affiliation with any religion, moreover, is not the same thing as out-and-out atheism - it can encompass a wide range of vaguely religious and spiritual beliefs.

1 - Secularism is *not* atheism. Using the two in the same article apparently interchangeably is incorrect.  
2 - ""out and out atheism"" = ""I do not believe in a god/I believe there is(are) no god(s)."" That statement says nothing about religious observance, such as prayer/meditation (often said to be the same thing though prayer implies an intended recipient), or spirituality.

&gt; And the churches retain formidable resources in terms of organisation, political influence and social prestige.

Which, according to the data, they should not have. Hence secularism: Get religion out of politics as it is the best thing for everyone.

&gt; But the days of most people automatically ticking the box marked ""C of E"" may well be numbered. And if the Christian majority continues to shrink, the historic privileges of the established church, and of Christianity generally, will become ever harder to defend.

I actually agree with that.

Do people *really* think this about secularists!? I don't understand where the idea comes from, unless it is an undertone of rhetoric from the religious in general. **It is not true!**

Secularism concerns the removal of religion from politics (and vice versa) and a few other things. Secularists *do not* ask or seek for religion to be outlawed. They *do not ask* for religious ceremonies to be stopped. They **do not** want to see religious buildings destroyed! Who told you that!?

There's absolutely nothing in secularism that could be extended to conclude that they wish religion to be abandoned along with everything associated with it. This actually worries me - How many people I've spoken to have assumed that I want to stick dynamite under St Paul's?!

Considering that most secularists (similar to atheists) are quite well versed on historical religious matters, we're more likely to understand how and why religious buildings (and art) came about. Contrary to what some people say about ""Religion is a wonderful inspiration for artists: Look at all the wonderful art and music that has resulted from religious devotion"": It is not *religion* as such that inspired much of the work, but it was religion that *paid* for it. The church had the money to commission the artists and also the architects! So even if we didn't like religious buildings/art *because* they were religious, it wouldn't really matter because it's highly likely the drive behind the artist was not religious, save for the cheque.

Secularists are not anti-religion, in fact there is nothing stopping the Archbishop of Canterbury from being a secularists except for his own self interests. You do not have to be an atheist to be a secularist who wishes to ensure that religion is separate from the state and politics and vice-versa.

&gt; What kind of nonsense is that? 'Because we're less religious we listen to religious people more'? Bullshit!

I'm afraid brigantus is correct. 

""Faith schools"": One third of all schools in Britain are faith schools with a religious ethos pandered to daily. Add to that the recent move for independent schools many of which will again be religiously driven, many British children are subject to religion all the time in their learning environment. It might surprise you to learn that collective worship (of a primarily Christian nature) is still *legally* required in the UK. Few schools observe it as anything other than a hymn in normal assembly but that is not the point: It is the law that children must worship. A small violation of their human rights perhaps, but a violation none the less.

""panels of religious figures replacing genuine democratic consultation"": Faith is given an overly large say in many public forums, even when you consider something like Radio 4 or BBC Question Time. When it comes to other matters, it can be more troubling. You must have heard about the recent amendment Nadine Dorries attempted to have made to the Health and Social bill concerning abortion counselling? These and other similar moves she's made such as in 2008 on the Human Fertilisation and Embryology bill are not isolated incidents. The Chrisitan right in the UK have learned from similar groups in the US on how to wheedle their way into politics even further. Recently religious groups were given (or it was planned to give them) seats on a board concerning sexual health etc. When you consider their motivations... This is not a good thing to happen!

Consider even the census last year (I've written quite a long comment about this [here on the thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/kv631/the_decline_of_christianity_in_the_uk/c2nhbxs)): The BHA campaigned to have the wording changed so that the leading question ""What is your religion?"" would be replaced with ""Do you have a religion?"" The actual question that was asked gives weight to those with a vested interest in keeping their religion in politics and public life. While the public grow ever more non-religious, these people use statistics such as ""70% of the public is Christian"" to try and force their morals on everyone.

I hope you found this interesting. If you take anything away from this comment, please take this: Secularists are not out to destroy religion!

Cheers!

His season finales were always an epic mess as he overwhelmed his storytelling by cramming as much he could into a small amount of space.

But Moffat hasn't been much better.  His stuff has been cheap, overblown and not creative. Cracks in time? Rebooting the universe? The angels get into your brain through your eyeballs now? Ugh. There hasn't been anything spectacular yet.  What episode from Moffat's series' could be considered a classic on par with ""Gridlock,"" ""Midnight,"" or ""Blink?"" There isn't one. They're all weak.

I personally feel like it's my favorite season so far, and my votes on mpierre.com reflect that (even if no one really votes yet).

There is no episode I didn't enjoy right away, something that didn't occur to me yet in any previous season of the reboot. The first part of the Flesh 2 parter felt bad but the ending of the 2nd part was amazing!

However, it all depends on a great season finale to tie it all.

I enjoy the Doctor being melancholic in secret because he knows he is going to die.

I utterly loved the mid-season finale. Having River being Melody blew my mind!

Then, Let's kill Hitler began weakly, but having Mel regenerate in River Song was just perfect and explained why River died in the Library without regenerating.

On the other hand, I didn't like the 5th season that much, with too many episodes begining strong and ending weak, especially in the first half. I also hated the angel's episode.

His entire tenure was built around finding moments for us to cry with David Tennant.

Why does every sign on the Shan Shen market turn to Bad Wolf at the end of Turn Left?  Because it gave us a moment of excitement, nevermind thats not how Bad Wolf worked in Season One.

One of the things that excited me about Moffat taking over was how expertly he had plotted everything he'd written during the Davies years.  I was so excited to have a whole season work like clockwork.  Moffat hasn't quite pulled that off 100%, there still a little bit of hand waving on the margins, but by and large its progress.  

My one unpleasant surprise with him how he's a little tone deaf about the sentiment. Thats right, he's not as good at being sentimental as Davies! He had a big ""all you need is love(for the Doctor)"" ending last season, but other than that, he'd been uninterested in the emotional side of things, especially for the companions(I'd be happy to explain this, but short version: no idea what to do with them personally, only idea what to do with them as a couple was play the love triangle to death).",0,1317309954,null,0,false,0,c2nii3y,t3_kunn4,t1_c2nii3y,t3_kunn4,1427663111,2,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,2

I think he definitely did some brilliant stuff when he was writing single/double episodes, but as an overall show runner/head writer, I've been pretty disappointed with how the series under Moffat has done. The episodes he himself writes are often confusing, leave lots of questions and sometimes provides answers, not all satisfactory. I can't decide if he's trying to do too much with his overall story, or if he lost control of his ideas somewhere along the way or if his arcs weren't necessarily planned out too well to begin with.

The three episodes you've listed I particularly enjoyed because the focus was not necessarily on the [seemingly convoluted) overall story arc, but because they were a bit more character driven. It was a small snippet of the adventures that gave wonderful insight into the characters, along with a good dose of adventure, a little bit of scary, and some fun.

Overall the image is great though, I'm okay with the hair detailing as otherwise hair ends up looking like a helmet. I think for me what becomes difficult is the jacket, shirt, tie appear very flat and work well with the background. However, the flesh, hair, and sonic screwdriver are more 3d crafted and create a conflict. 

I also think from a composition standpoint, the hand and sonic become problematic. Cropping appendages always creates a strange feeling about the piece, which you can use to your advantage, however when unintentional it can work against you. Here the hand appears to be floating as if it's someone else's hand and the doctor is inspecting it. 

For me, I would say taking the jacket and shirt and adding more shape based shading like it appears in the skin would help round it out more. Once done with that I would probably add texture or alter the background to give it more depth. 

Of course you can take it in the other direction and focus less on detail and stylize it more by making the hand and skin in more flat stye similar to the shirt and jacket. I think that would honestly prove to be a closer fit to your style. It seems you have great handling with the use of flat shapes and pattern to create the idea of an object. I look at that shirt and I think that is the strongest part of the piece. It utilizes line work to create the feeling of movement and flow of that fabric, I perceive that as reality. I'd love to see what you could do with this image or another one where you stick to the style of the fabric you have here. Carry that pattered stacking system over into the skin and I think you'll get a unique and great image. Feel free to contact me, I'd be happy to talk more on this.

It comes across like he has an idea for a story premise and jumps in with no idea how it's going to end.

Admittedly Davies has some really good ideas but often I've thoroughly enjoyed the majority of an episode just to have the last quarter ruin it (The Next Doctor).

Moffat on the other hand is meticulous in making sure his stories have satisfying conclusions. Anything important in resolving the story is always alluded to earlier in the story in some way or if a twist is involved the clues are there. Everything makes sense given the rules laid out in an episode. I sometimes feel that Moffat's season arcs get a little too complicated though, like he's trying a bit too hard to be clever.

true,[deleted],null,null,"I think Davies was a pretty sloppy storyteller. My biggest issue, and perhaps this is something that has been carried on from the classic Doctor Who (never watched it), but his episodes have a lot of instances of Deus Ex Machina. There's always some special function the TARDIS, Screwdriver, or even the Doctor himself has that ends up saving the day. 

This especially bothered me in the Season 3 and 4 finale. Both ended up with the Doctor having some ridiculous power to save everyone. In Season 4 they did at least show the hand a couple times prior to the finale, but it still felt really forced and not really a show of ingenuity.

Basically, I feel like Davies always tries to come up with interesting premises but isn't clever enough to put in that last twist or to come up with a final conclusion that really satisfies (the Bad Wolf plotline is the exception for me, I thought that he set that up beautifully and ended it perfectly).

I suppose there's also the cheesiness factor. There are a lot of episodes that, for me, are completely ruined by how cheesy the villains are. I suppose cheesiness is a cornerstone of Doctor Who when you look at how obnoxious the Daleks look/act, along with the Cybermen (more serious, but still walk around yelling ""DELETE, DELETE!""). Those two enemies are always enjoyable, however, in that their motives and actions are very dark; a lot of other villains are just annoyingly cheesy, such as in Aliens in London and Love &amp; Monsters.

Moffat, to me, is better because he manages to make great characters and puts them in fun or interesting situations.

From [this article](http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2011/jan/26/battle-for-olympic-stadium):
&gt; The threatened move was also a useful shot across the bows of Haringey council. Believing it had the club over a barrel, it sought to exact ever greater financial commitments in exchange for granting planning permission. Had it made some concessions a little earlier, no one would have got round to mentioning Stratford.

Naturally, Haringey Council [denied that was the case](http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2011/jan/29/haringey-support-spurs-in-tottenham).

I can hold my hands up and admit to being completely wrong about it but the impression left from all of it is that both sides were trying to play hardball in terms of what they could get out of the deal, and now the rug has been completely pulled from under the Council's feet as a result of the riots, while simultaneously there is enormous political pressure on the GLA (hence Boris sticking his oar in) to appear to be doing something - which from a business perspective could not stengthen Tottenham's position any more.

Given that Tottenham will be doing far more for the area by staying in it whether they pay the S106 or not (I'm not sure why you think a new stadium will be a negative impact on such an impoverished area), and that they are involved with Community projects and development anyway, you can see why Levy feels able to say ""Like it or lump it"" (and even more so when he reckons he could save 150-200 million by going the Olympic stadium route). 

It might be unpalatable and not particularly attractive but the unique blend of circumstances have created the situation and as a businessman Levy is going to do what he can to exploit them - I'm pretty sure any developer that was able to get the GLA to pay 8.5 million towards their project would bite Boris' arm off. Not necessarily very attractive, but we live in pretty bleak times.

Edit: The guy in that video makes a few good points, and I have to say there are things about Rose that I don't like (her tendency to leave her mouth hanging open a lot, for starters), but in the end I am a sucker for a love story. Also, I didn't think season 4 was all about Rose's return, not until the end at least. And his idea that people who love Rose don't like the other companions absolutely doesn't apply to me. Here's why:

Martha: Admittedly not my favorite, but she was really smart and self-sufficient. 

Donna: She was a fucking blast! She was hilarious, witty, fun to be around, intuitive, I really do love her. She's the type of girl I'd love to go have a pint with. 

Amy: Not sure this should count because it's with a different Doctor, but I mostly like her. I think she was quite rude to Rory at the beginning, and she isn't the sharpest knife in the drawer, but overall she's agreeable enough for me.

true,nssmuckers,num5-away,,"You're probably right, but I believe part of it is that those players got experience because their teams had needs for them, and we really didn't need Tom. 

You look at Arsenal and their squad was absolutely crying for a deep-lying playmaker, so it's not surprising Wilshere got opportunities playing a double pivot with Song. 

Chelsea is the same thing...Lampard is going to be out to pasture soon enough and they're obviously desperate for creative midfielders hence the Mata and Meireles signings and their pursuit of Modders. 

You look at us, the one thing we DON'T need any more of is creative midfielders. Modric is probably the best deep-lying playmaker in England, Huddlestone is an extremely underrated deep-lying playmaker with a lot of experience. I'd even argue that Scott Parker operates as a #6, keeping things moving...as VDV said, he's far more than a holding midfielder. 

I'm not saying Tom is anywhere near Jack or Josh, but I don't think you can blame him for not getting playing time in the PL over people in our midfield. Personally I don't think even Wilshere (who I rate extremely highly, by the way) would be in our first 11, even if we played Arsenal's 4-2-3-1. Certainly not McEachran.

Davies and Moffat aren't trying to do the same things; Davies' arcs were deliberately *emotional* arcs rather than plot arcs, with recurring motifs dropped in for the fans. Moffat's arcs are deliberately *plot* arcs rather than emotional arcs. The two approaches are going to be very different by their very nature.

In fact arguably Davies was more successful in his approach in terms of pure numbers, consistently growing the series' audience each year to its series four peak. Moffat is better at plotting but honestly don't believe the general audience tunes in for plot. Davies was better at making viewers care about Rose/Donna etc and that's what most normal people tune into shows for. This is underlined by their backgrounds; Moffat comes from a sitcom background where character is more or less irrelevant and plot is everything, whereas Davies comes from a drama background where plot is more or less irrelevant and character is everything.

We can hold up Miracle Day, but that's a silly thing to do without also holding up the brilliantly executed Children of Earth. And it's not like Moffat is without his own misfires. It's to be expected of any writer.

The best way to analyze their writing is to actually remove the Doctor Who factor altogether. Moffat gave us remakes of Friends, Jekyll and Sherlock Holmes.

It seems the [National Secular Society](http://www.secularism.org.uk/) is not reaching everyone just yet. There are local groups already active and more are springing up, particularly in Universities. The [British Humanist Association](http://www.humanism.org.uk/home) is doing similar.

The NSS is *very* active in both national and to a certain degree international campaigns. For example you will have heard of cases such as the [British Airways lady who was 'sacked for wearing a cross'](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eweida_v_British_Airways_plc) (actually the reality is she was *eventually* sacked for refusing to comply with uniform rules and being very disruptive), the [Relate counsellor who was sacked for refusing](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/bristol/8651417.stm) to work with gay couples, the [registrar who refused to perform civil partnerships](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/london/8557966.stm) for gay couples and other cases? Well the NSS campaigned against their grievances in the first place, but now these four have been taken by the Christian Legal Centre to the European Court of Human Rights. The [NSS is the only body defending the decisions made by the UK courts,  in Strasbourg](http://www.secularism.org.uk/nss-intervention-aims-to-protect.html).

Much of the work the NSS does is trying to correct the misinformation, lies and bad press from religious organisations with a ulterior motives. Consider what [Mantonization seemed to think secuarlism](http://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/kv631/the_decline_of_christianity_in_the_uk/c2nhb1n) involves: I'm not saying he got that idea from a religious group, but they sure as hell tend to imply that that's the sort of thing the NSS want!

Again when it comes to phrasing a question, if you make it clear to people *why* the NSS do what they do i.e. ""Do you want your children to be preached to at school every day?"" then the public will generally agree with the NSS that Collective Worship is not a good thing!

So... [do you want to join the NSS](http://www.secularism.org.uk/join-and-renew.html)? It's reasonable and worth it! Plus if you're near Bristol you can come along to our meetings at the Bristol Secular Society :) Actually you can do that without joining the NSS, but you'll be oneofus-oneofus.

true,[deleted],null,null,"I don't think it was RTD's intention to write anything that would stand the test of time; he's made it very clear multiple times that he wanted to capture a mainstream audience ... and he did. Honestly I think the RTD/Moffat divide is really just typical fan moaning over nothing. Doctor Who under RTD became an unprecedented pop culture phenomenon in its home market, and he deserves an enormous amount of credit for that.

When people criticize his writing skills, nine times out of ten you can guarantee they've never seen any of his ""real"" drama work. He wrote Doctor Who the way he did *because that's what was going to sell it to a mainstream audience.* It was a deliberate choice; he made other choices writing other shows, and they paid off in similar ways, because he became known as the single best dramatist in the UK and was given Doctor Who to bring back as a direct result of that reputation.

An 87 is also a high AI incidentally. In fact Doctor Who generally gets a strong AI no matter the story, probably because general viewers don't really care about plot the way fans do. *We* see ""Curse of the Black Spot"" as terrible, but the general audience rated it 86 (the ""excellent"" category). General audiences like romps and character pieces; *fans* like story arcs and tight plots.

re:ASOIAF The series is quite good, though budget stuff means that they cut out a lot of things like Ned's flashbacks and all battles.

Modric could certainly play in the hole or on the right or on the left or anywhere in midfield, but based on the last few years I don't think there's any doubt his best position is deep, pulling the strings. 

We haven't played Modric in the hole for a long time so I was assuming you meant VDV could replace him in his current position. I don't disagree with trying Sandro / Parker deep in a 4-2-3-1 with Modders in the hole but I do think VDV is much better at that position because he's much better at finishing inside the penalty box.

I'm not trying to be a dick about it, but how can you deduce anything if you don't pay attention to all the details? I'm obsessed with Doctor Who, not for the last few years since the revival, but since 1986. You may think that I would have found some other media obsession, but no, so I've memorized entire story arcs scene-for-scene and word-for-word (had 16 years to do so during the hiatus. I called Fox and complained about the 1996 movie when it aired.) I can recite most of the dialog in the exact cadence and timing from pretty much every episode from Pyramids of Mars to Survival. I'm not bragging. It's not exactly fun at parties, and girls don't give a fuck about classic Who for the most part... Basically, you're not talking to someone who recently got into the show *or* who only has a passing interest in it. I've never had just a passing interest in DW. I have barely watched anything that isn't DW for the last 25 years. I did watch BSG and Caprica a couple times through, and I almost cared about that universe. Not enough material though. You get cut no slack if you want to discuss it with me, though. Especially if your intent is to poke holes in my cohesive overview of the DW universe that I have literally spent decades creating in my head.

SOOO, yeah, a) Civilian technicians seen in Arc of Inifinity. Definitely not Time Lords, and it is heavily implied that guards aren't either. Not just in that story. You've seen Invasion of Time. Why would Andred hook up with Leela just to watch her get old and die?

b) Presidents do indeed serve until they are pretty much almost dead, forever dead. The whole point of the Five Doctors was Borusa knowing he was on his last body and not being able to stand the idea of retiring. 
The ""facts"" so to speak don't need to be altered since, yes, a retiring President would indeed be on his last life.

A solution could be to make Pass Plus part of the core syllabus. Going on a motorway should not be part of the driving test (as places like Norfolk would have major problems), but it should be taught by the instructor, along with how to overtake, driving at night, etc.

The standard for passing your test should probably be higher. At the moment, the examiners tick boxes and, if you don't have too many ticks in the wrong places, you pass.

Not to mention that driving beyond the speed limit, no matter what it is, introduces risks. If everyone assumes that 70mph is the top speed, they may be more lax in their decision-making or their lookout scan, not taking into account that other vehicles could be travelling faster. Not to mention that some may pull out too early, incorrectly judging the gap they thought they could get into.

Now, these may seem like petty things, but you'd be amazed at how much they can matter. Judgement is the most woolly part of driving. Not driving according to protocol does not help.

He would probably carry [one of these](http://www.forbiddenplanet.co.uk/images/2008/January/10/A3733.jpg) and not know what it is until the Doctor, in the last few minutes before Jesus' death, realizes he is a Time Lord, opens the fob watch and turns him into his original self.

Because Jesus has spent all his life teaching his followers about forgiveness, he decides to go through with his plan of being crucified in an attempt to preserve God's name and prophecies. Once that is over he waits until he is buried and then regenerates; it takes him three days to really recover due to the delayed regeneration.

The Doctor, seeing Jesus pull a delayed regeneration, discusses it with him and learns his secret. He then proceeds to [spoilers for season 6](/s ""Lake Silencio where he is attacked and killed by the astronaut, and delays his regeneration until the others have left, thus preventing any of them from getting into dangerous situations and making everyone believe he's dead."")

Also, if not for a friend of mine who's probably obsessed on the same level as you, I wouldn't even know that DW had writers. I mean obviously shows have writers, but I'd never really thought about the idea that *People wrote this stuff.* I've never seen DWC either.

I'm sure Leela loved Andred and vice versa. It was written and so it is. I pointed out the lack of logic in the relationship because you used the logic of their relationship as a reason for why they're all Time Lords. Which isn't even valid anyways because look at all the times the Doctor has fallen in love. Love isn't logical.

I don't know who thinks things like ""Oh it's just a writer"" when they watch a show. That's off. But one does have to critically analyze the things they watch. Or they should. Or at least I think one should if it's a show they deeply care about- and DW has been my biggest obsession ever and I've had year-spanning ones.

Being autistic doesn't really matter. You'd probably be on the high functioning spectrum around Asperger's anyways.

I believe that one of the reasons people (and the trends say, geeks as well) love Doctor Who is because it's an entire world. It's a show where you can quote episodes and continuity. It's like a *system*. To know the episodes is to know the system, know the system and you know everything. Knowledge is power.

&gt; I think the idea is that because the head of state is head of the Church, the country is institutionally Christian.

My point was that if a very small minority of people are actually practicing Christians, would the country still be considered ""Christian""? Also with regards the head of state also being the head of the CoE: What if a future king or queen was an atheist or wished to be a Muslim? I have no doubt that some have been non-believers in the past, but prevented from declaring it.

&gt; So the Lords Spiritual are in fact chosen by elected officials.

That's as may be, but you're overlooking the fact that they *have* to be chosen in the first place. Their qualifications leaving them suitable for office is primarily that they are not only religious, but that they are religious *men*. There's more than just the issue that they are there because of their religion that is at play here, but it's worth making it clear: If they didn't believe in their god then they wouldn't even be considered in the first place. It's not, as you seem to imply, that the public choose a PM who chooses some religious people, rather it is *specifically* male members of the Church of England. 

*I went on a small ramble about how few people attend CoE events/church every week, but it was a bit out of place, so I've tacked it on the end.*

In any case the whole process is actually (from your link):

&gt; Archbishops and bishops are appointed by The Queen on the advice of the Prime Minister, who considers the names selected by a Church Commission.

So it goes Church &gt; PM &gt; Queen. And the Archbishops of Canterbury and York are in there by default. Why should a group of officials from a increasingly marginalised religion get to choose among themselves to put people in power who then have a say in our laws?

It is grossly unfair, unjust and undemocratic.
___________

Bishops are chosen for the House of Lords from one small religious group: The CoE. The CoE has been losing members, had declining worship numbers and event attendance for decades now. From the CoE website:

&gt; [1.7 million people take part in a Church of England service each month, a level that has been maintained since the turn of the millennium. Approximately one million participate each Sunday.](http://www.churchofengland.org/about-us/facts-stats.aspx)


The CoE has, according to their own research, has [*well under 1 million* Sunday attendees and they have known it for years](http://www.churchsociety.org/issues_new/church/stats/iss_church_stats_attendance.asp). Between 1996 and 1997 their Sunday attendance went under 1 million and it has not risen above it since. A few years ago they switched to [measuring weekly](http://www.ekklesia.co.uk/node/11080) claiming that this gave a better indication for people coming to church as there are many midweek services. Possibly, but now it seems they measure monthly. Suspicious, considering that when they do this the numbers look 'better' from this change. I must be a terrible cynic.

To conclude: The Lords Spiritual are not chosen in a democratic way and often act in accordance with their religious beliefs rather than in an impartial fashion. This, coupled with the fact that a tiny fraction of the British public actually support them by attending church on a Sunday/Weekly/Monthly, should make it clear to anyone that their seats in the Lords should be revoked.

:D :D My apologies. As you might have noticed I'm quite passionate about this topic. In case you felt 'attacked' or similar, I'm sorry I should have made it clear that my questions were partially rhetorical, partially aimed at those who think the Bishops being in the Lords is 'OK'.

&gt;  Does it mean the population, or the state?

Good question. But can there be a state without a population?

&gt; IIRC, they have to be Anglican, or forfeit the throne.

I think you're right. Similar to them not being allowed to marry a Catholic. That's something the NSS is campaigning against too, as I think it falls under a violation of Human Rights.

&gt; They have to do a lot more than be religious men to get nominated for bishop

My point was that if they weren't religious then they wouldn't be a Bishop. Of course they are in that position for a reason, as you describe, but they would not be there if they did not profess (or pretend to profess) a religious conviction that is specifically CoE. And they have to be male, don't forget.

&gt; Leaving the decision to the PM is a step better than leaving it all to the Queen, 

Again, very possibly. But that doesn't mean it's not undemocratic! Consider me asking if you'd like a broken window or a broken door. I doubt whether you'd be happy that you got a choice! You're still going to have something broken and it would be better for you if you had neither interfered with.

&gt; and the Lords Spiritual are not alone in the unjust appointment brigade - see hereditary peers.

You're not wrong. But since July there have only been 90 (yay Wiki!) and I believe they are slowly being phased out? In any case, two wrongs etc.

What that means, is that even though one party might hold a seat in government, there is always going to be an ""opposition"" that has a very real voice.  For the last few years, the conservatives have been in charge, but the liberals have been the opposition (meaning that the conservatives can't just pass a law without the liberals approving as well - it leads to compromise and a nice balance).  Right now, unfortunately, the conservative government won a ""majority vote"", meaning that they are their own opposition (gross over simplification).

In practice, this system keeps a balance.  Someone can't get 51% of the votes and then just take over.

That being said, it wasn't until late in Tennant's run that I started to like his Doctor, but now I have to say that his personality has helped him grow on me. Smith's Doctor (due to his wackiness combined with emotional depth) has been tied with Eccleston from the very beginning of Series 5. I would say that it doesn't matter which series you focus on at first, because they are all great, and every actor plays the Doctor in a different, fresh way that will grow on you. Starting at 1 helps ease you into the story, but starting at 5 really does offer a bit more bang for your buck, not only in special effects, but also in incredibly emotional and well-written storylines.

Another aspect of their claims in the past is that the ISP's backbone and  peering may not meet the speed at which your router syncs. So they sell you a 20meg service, your router syncs at 8meg and then your downloads only get 2meg. No other ISP could get you more than 8meg, because that's the limitation of the copper line, but other ISPs could give you 4meg, 6meg or 7.5meg.

If the ISP offers a service for £6.50 a month (are there any that are that cheap?) then the cost of renting the line from BT might be £4 a month. If you get only 1meg speeds then you'd pay only £3.25 for your ADSL and the ISP would make a £0.75p loss before you even downloaded anything.

So doing this would require OFCOM require Openreach (BT Wholesale) rent the line to the ISPs at the proportional rate, also. I don't think this is fair because it's usually the longer lines that get poorer speeds - Openreach would be getting the least for the lines with the most infrastructure and the highest maintenance requirements (and getting the most for people who live next to the exchange). I could see this having some really unintended consequences.

Long-term this should be pretty much sorted out with FTTC/FTTH, when all houses in the street get 40meg - 50meg, irrespective of distance from the exchange. Perhaps that would be the time to introduce a proportional billing requirement, as the download speed would be strictly dependent on the ISP's backbone and peering.",0,1317350393,null,0,false,0,c2nohzm,t3_kv6gh,t1_c2nohzm,t1_c2ni4ht,1427666008,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

Anyway as for your question I think Toby Whithouse is the most likely replacement for Moffat, since he has written under both of Moffat's seasons and has experience being head writer (Being Human). That being said however I do not think he is the best Doctor Who writer, but i do think that he is a more than competent writer, and the writers that I do feel are better have either written to little for me to understand what exactly there image of the show is or haven't written an episode in a while (since the start of the Moffat reign). The other reason why I think Toby would be a good choice is because i feel that his image of the show is similar to that of Moffat's, i say this because in every whithouse episode there is focus on the negative aspects of the doctor (School Reunion focuses on how companions can't cope with the real world after he abandons them, Vampires in Venice has a focus on how the doctor makes people a danger to themselves, and The God Complex has to many criticisms of the doctor for me to write all of them down right now)
TLDR: Toby Whithouse, because even though I don't think he's the best Doctor Who Writer (although after the god complex he's in my top 8) I feel that he would make a good show runner.      ",0,1317351223,null,0,false,0,c2nom8t,t3_kw01w,t1_c2nom8t,t3_kw01w,1427666063,3,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,3

The problem with this is that there aren't even enough council houses for those who are genuinely and desperately homeless.

The unemployed don't just get a council house for the asking nowadays, and kicking out those who have been in council houses for decades doesn't solve the problem.

We *used* to have enough council houses that the likes of nurses and council workers and those on lower incomes could have one, then Thatcher sold off this national asset at bargain-basement prices. The shocking thing is that it's the employed who lived in these properties that were most able to take advantage of the sell-off and reap in the equity. 

At one time, in the mid-70s, a *third of the population* lived in council houses [[cite](http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b0109dvs)], thus they were a relatively balanced community (compared to how they are now). If you sell off all the nicer estates and they end up gentrified, the worst elements will end up being concentrated together in smaller and smaller areas, the remaining houses in areas in which no one wants to buy because they're deepening ghettos.

Building more council houses (having repealed the law that allows tenants to purchase them) would not have the immediate effect of plunging property prices and creating negative equity, because it's such a long slow job.

Like I said, I don't know much about how the political system works.  I'm 31 years old and I've only voted twice in my life.  I just find that things stay the same regardless of who is in power.  Lately that means the rich get richer and the poor get poorer.  

Regarding Vancouver, I would most certainly endorse your decision to move there.  I've never lived there, but have many friends who do and have visited several times.  I love the west coast big time, but it all feels a bit ""frontier"" and recent-immigrant heavy (I'm not racist, but Van has more asians than europeans, I live the the ""old"" european coast.  In the east we emigrated to Canada 200+ years ago, on the west most of the population emigrated to Canada 200+ months ago) to an east coaster like me.  I kind of like how easy it is for me to live on the east coast, I had built in connections from the day I was born so I stand behind the saying ""east coast is best coast"".  

Canada is crazy like that, many people are very geographically opinionated.  People in the east talk bad about the central/west coast and people from the west talk bad about the central/east coast.  Quebec thinks it's a different country, and the big flat middle of Canada wants nothing to do with the rest of us but realizes that without us they would basically become a frontier society (again).

It's hard to explain how a country the size of Canada can actually co-exist.  It's not like the USA, you folks have 10x the number of people that we do.  80+% of our population lives in something like 5% of our geographic area.

But he's been a fairly regular writer for the show, so I see what people mean when he seems like a logical choice.

That being said, though, I like a lot of Gareth Roberts' episodes. He did:
*The Shakespeare Code*,
*The Unicorn and the Wasp*,
*Planet of the Dead* (co-written with Russell T. Davies),
*The Lodger*, and
*Closing Time*

Those first two were both very solid standalone episodes, and the latter two have been some of my favorites in seasons five and six respectively. Especially in his work with the 11th Doctor, I feel that he captures the voice and character better than a lot of the other writers do, besides Moffat. He highlights that lovable strangeness and awkwardness particularly well in *The Lodger* and there was some nice dialogue in each of the other episodes he's written. He also has a lot of experience with *The Sarah Jane Adventures* apparently, which I haven't seen but imagine only go towards lending him credibility as a solid writer for *Doctor Who*.",0,1317356639,null,0,false,0,c2npc5g,t3_kw01w,t1_c2npc5g,t3_kw01w,1427666404,9,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,9

I see what you did there.

Knowing that the TV movie was meant to kick off a revived series of *Doctor Who*, I am glad that they didn't go forward with it, given so many of the mistakes made in the Whovie. (There, I tried it. It... works.) McGann's portrayal of the Doctor was definitely the highlight of the film, once he got past the melodramatic ""WHO AM I?!"" post-regeneration scene.

I was alternately intrigued and confused by a lot of the other creative decisions that were made in the movie. Exploring more of the TARDIS the way they did was interesting; the Asian kid mostly confused me; front-loading so much relatively useless information (i.e. the first scene with the Daleks, among other things) bothered me because of how throw-away the information ultimately became; Grace as a companion intrigued me.

I am glad the Whovie happened, since it opened up many new possibilities and set a lot of bad precedent that the 2005-present revival has managed to avoid. And I'm sad that McGann never got a chance to expand his Doctor's character on-screen.

But not the same way Donna was. Donna was her big sister, I think Amy and the Doctor have a more balanced sibling relationship. The Doctor sees her as a little girl/sister, but sometimes you can tell that Amy treats him like a kid sometimes. So it's more that they switch around roles of being the adult.

Rory: He's a Time Lord. He'll be fine!

Amy: It's just what they're called, it doesn't mean he actually knows what he's doing.

Normally I wear a medium, but I've put on about 20 pounds in the past couple of years and I didn't want something tight around the middle.  The fabric is polyester, so I think even if the arm length isn't ideal for you, it just bunches a tad along the arms.  Nothing strange looking.  The cuffs are elastic, so it will keep the arms from sagging past your hands.  

I got it from worldsoccershop.com.  The base model short sleeved is 74.99 and the long sleeve is 84.99.  If you want to get a ""player's jersey"" with the number and name, patches on the arms, etc, it's a bit more.  I think mine was 110 or so.  If you're feeling cheeky, they can put your name and whatever number you pick, as well.  Just be aware that official lettering (in the style of the team's jerseys, vs generic font, costs a bit more, but not much.)  

Check the small print, but I believe the base model jerseys are returnable, where as the customized ones aren't.  You could always order a base one to see how it fits and get a feel for the size, then return it and get a customized one once you figure out your size.  Just a thought.

And I agree, I think it did a good job of bridging. I remembering reading a very good article on this subject that unfortunately I can't find at the moment. Basically it described how the Whovie paved the way for several creative decisions that the 2005-present series has built upon, such as companion/Doctor romance, and the current series has learned from many of the mistakes of the Whovie, such as the need to focus on the companion as an audience surrogate rather than open with the Doctor's monologue which is both confusing and isolating as a means of bringing in new fans.

I got it from worldsoccershop.com. The base model short sleeved is 74.99 and the long sleeve is 84.99. If you want to get a ""player's jersey"" with the number and name, patches on the arms, etc, it's a bit more. I think mine was 110 or so. If you're feeling cheeky, they can put your name and whatever number you pick, as well. Just be aware that official lettering (in the style of the team's jerseys, vs generic font, costs a bit more, but not much.)

Check the small print, but I believe the base model jerseys are returnable, where as the customized ones aren't. You could always order a base one to see how it fits and get a feel for the size, then return it and get a customized one once you figure out your size. Just a thought.

Quite often I would see the whole black bag moving from where it was packed with Maggots. I tried a lot to combat this and in the end I had to do a daily regular hosing down of the bin followed by bleach and then insecticide powder. The lid was kept closed, but they would lay around the edge still and then the maggots would somehow creep into the bin.

The other aspect of course having a baby in the house is they poo into  nappies and that nappy needs to go into the bin. These bins are black plastic and spend a certain amount of time exposed to the sun. The result is food waste and nappies are cooked up all day creating on of the worst ranking smells you can imagine.

I think it's a culturally imposed norm more than anything, 13 might be the median lifespan, it was never discussed so it's undiscovered country really. 

It could just be a societal thing, before the time war there was always a chance Gallifrey would catch up with him and make him face his end, the war came and elevated him to lead their armies only for him to betray them and condemn them at the same time. Now the time lords are de facto locked away and he has the key (always a chance they could come back, slipping ratings do wonders for plot twists.) 

With his loathing of their moral failings and his destruction/imprisonment of them for their crimes, why would he care now about their laws or breaking a taboo crimes? He knows he can still die from many things (Cheem-7 and being killed during a regeneration, I'm quite sure he read his entire file.) so he understands he's still mortal, he has strong morals, a sense of justice, and other than 10's mini-god complex on Mars, he's pretty well grounded for a guy who travels in time.

You really think a difference of four people is going to determine whether I'm right or wrong? 19 upvotes means at least 19 people agree with me, and things may have been different if I posted at a different time of day. Because of the downvotes, a lot of people didn't see this. [My similar post sat at the top of r/thehub](http://www.reddit.com/r/TheHub/comments/kv5ct/i_cant_be_the_only_one/) for about a day, and the popup has been removed there.

&gt;I'm not ""power tripping"" - I'm just laying out fact.

Your so-called ""fact"" -- that ""it's time"" for me to get over something because it's inconvenient for you -- is personally insulting. 

&gt; Those are somehow less ""shoving it in everyone's face"" than a little box which only appears when you have your mouse over the downvote button and in no way impedes the functionality or display of the site?

Yes. Animation is distracting and weird on a site without any. The popup disregards the usual channels of discourse. It goes out of its way to be seen. And then, it must be seen over, and over, and over again.
 
&gt;IMO, it's clear from the fact that you've downvoted each one of my on-topic posts, because you don't like what they say, that the reason you're taking it personally is because you're one of the people it's aimed at.

Everyone thinks that THEIR posts DO contribute usefully to discussions, so it's not surprise that you think this about yours. IMO, ""It's time for you to just get over it,"" is not a contribution. It's nothing but an insult, and your other comments were deflective. Had your comments been helpful, they would have been upvoted.

Unfortunately for me, I'm presently unable to downvote at all, because the adblock filter I added to get rid of the popup makes the downvote button disappear completely when I hover. I'm happy to live with that if it means I don't have to see the popup, but hopefully I'll get this fixed soon.

Which we know to be dodgy now and there was much speculation at the time.

He said Saddam was a threat to the region and it was better he was gone, which I can well understand. I can't find a source at the moment but I believe I have heard him speak about Saddam doing nasty things to his people as a reason to remove him too.

My point was that if Blair thought this to be the case, then why didn't he ever talk or removing other dictators? Consider Kim Jong Il - No-one world leader appears *too* troubled that his people are living in squalor.

true,HonoraryMancunian,null,Honorary Manc,"Don't say 'quid'. If you've ever noticed how wrong it sounds for a Brit in America to say 'bucks', then you'd understand.


Same goes for 'mate'. American words for friend like 'buddy', 'pal, 'dude', 'man' etc are fine if you hear them used by the Brits around you.


I could go on but as you can see the general rule is don't use Britishisms (unless ironically) and try to avoid Americanisms unless they're used by the Brits you're hanging out with.


Unfortunately though, when it comes to the use of 'soccer' vs 'football' vs 'footie', you won't always get it right as there'll be some who'll get annoyed at you using one term, and some who'll get annoyed at you using the other. Use your best judgement. But whatever you do, it's called the **Premiership (or Premeir League) NOT the *English* Premier League** (unless you're in Scotland) and certainly don't call it by it's official name the Barclays Premier League, as you'll just sound like a nob.


Don't talk about America too much, unless prompted. Especially not in a negative way, as it just sounds like you're pandering.


If someone mocks/copies your accent, feel free to do the same back: **so long as you get it right**. By this I mean don't just put on a posh or Cockney accent if they don't sound like that. It is, however, acceptable to do this if the mocker is putting on a stereotypical American accent which is clearly different from yours (make sure it's obvious you're doing it to prove a point, though).


This is becoming tl;dr but if I think of more I'll add to it.

As far as the article goes it states that they intend to erect blockades, tents, kitchens and to stay there for a few months.  I'll tell you exactly how that will go.  Paternoster Square is privately owned land.  I'd be very surprised if they get permission for a static protest, and the group itself recognises that they'll likely have to base any longterm protest elsewhere from Paternoster Sq.  So an insular tent community will spring up somewhere where they're not going to get any attention to their cause. Credit to them for saying they don't want to shut down the exchange or stop it from trading.  Best of luck to them because they seem intent on peaceful protest without forcing local businesses to suffer, but it seems to have already relegated itself to *'We are disgruntled people living in tents'*.  We already know there's disgruntled people.  Most of the country is.  I just don't see what this adds to that.
