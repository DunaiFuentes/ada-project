The broadcasters control what can and can't be recorded, as they send the EPG data to Sky for broadcast to receivers - for example, try recording ""Pages from Ceefax"" from the BBC, you'll find it won't let you. Is Sky stopping people from recording a teletext news loop with elevator music?

&gt;*The Roadster's true range is only 55 miles per charge. Clarkson says: ""Although Tesla say it will do 200 miles we worked out that on our track it would run out after just 55 miles.""*

&gt;Fact: The Roadster has been certified under UN ECE R101, the EU regulation for measuring electric vehicle range, at 211 miles. All ECE R101 tests are witnessed and certified by a neutral third party approved by the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe, in Tesla's case, the Department of Road Transport – Netherlands. Of course, a car driven aggressively will get reduced mileage, regardless of whether its fueled by petrol or electricity, as Top Gear found. At the other end of the spectrum, through mindful driving, a Tesla owner achieved an astounding 313 miles on a single charge. To let either of these extremes represent real-world range is an incomplete analysis.

&gt;*One of the Roadsters ran out of charge and had to be pushed into the Top Gear hangar by four men.*

&gt;Fact: Neither Roadster ran out of charge during Top Gear's tests, or even came close. We know because the Roadster records basic operating information. The show fails to mention that neither Roadster ever went below twenty-five percent charge. Why stage the stunt of pushing it into the hangar?

&gt;*The Roadster's brakes broke, rendering the car not drivable.*

&gt;Fact: During Top Gear’s drive on the test track, the fuse for the braking system's electric vacuum pump failed. But the brakes were operational and safe. The result was like driving a car without the convenient power brakes to which we’ve grown accustomed. Tesla's brakes, both with and without the fuse, must pass all UN ECE safety tests, and they do.

&gt;*Neither Roadster provided to Top Gear was available for test driving due to these problems.*

&gt;Fact: At all times, there was at least one Roadster at the ready.


Apart from the first one, it does seem like Tesla have a good case.

Similarly since a lot of the countries around the world don't have a film industry or much of a TV industry their heads are also buried in books and something that is in contrast to their reading appeals to them.

Don't be so naïve. They are working to keep the peace. Sometimes this means protecting the general populace from bad elements, sometimes it means protecting the government from the populace. They don't care about right and wrong, they care about legal or not legal. What is legal is set and controlled by the Government. The Police are instruments of the Government, not the people. Note the word: **Government**. Those that *govern*. They govern us. From the latin 'guberno', to steer or control.

The Police don't work for us. The Government doesn't work for us. They like to make us think they do, but they don't. Don't fall for the 'democracy' bullshit. The only difference between us and your average dictatorship is the fact that we get to *choose* our dictator.

Technically, the Fortnum and Mason sit-in was illegal. That is all that matters. They were legally correct to arrest anyone there. You have to remember that we are *allowed* to protest peacefully by our legal system. Break the rules of what that system allows, and you have to expect, and accept, the consequences.

If you accept those rules, then you have to protest *within* those rules. Most of what happened was within the rules, but the Fortnum and Mason sit-in was not. The smashing of shop-fronts and banks was not.

Not because they were lied to, but because it makes it seem that the decision to arrest so many of them was made at a higher level than the police dealing with the situation on the ground.

Really, they had the situation under control, they got the protesters out, at that point they could have let them go, like they said they would. Which makes me think that arresting them, a lot of people, using a lot of resources, was done for reasons not to do with public order in that specific situation, but for some other reason. So what would really be interesting to know would be who made that decision, when they made it, and why. Obviously I can only speculate wildly, in the best leftie tradition, that this was a political decision, to send a message to UK Uncut, to put people off from similar actions in future, maybe even to try and discredit them somehow, or perhaps to distract from how few of the black block types they arrested, despite them being the ones who did all the damage.

The thing about my theory, if it was even partly true, is that it shows the police acting to enforce a political view, and to stifle protest. And that is a sign of a police state. I'm not saying that we're suddenly in some dystopian future. Just that the police are often political, or are used for political ends. This happens under every govt.

Anyone who've been involved with the police can tell you that's a bad combination of things to do. You can annoy the police while not breaking the law and get away with it, you can even break the law and if you've not annoyed them or done anything that serious, you can get away with it. But if you break the law and annoy the police they are not going to let you get away with it. It's mostly human nature, if your in any position of authority and someone breaks the rules while annoying you, your not going to show any leeway.

As for a political move to stifle legitimate political protest, for that to happen the police would have to be strongly in support of the coalition, which they're not as their funding is being cut along side this. There will probably be plenty of cops who are angry that the banking sector appears to have gotten away with it, angry their funding is being cut and angry that every time they do their job whichever moron is the home sectary at the given time will either give them shit about how they do their job, or offer glad-handing support while slashing budgets, benefits and so forth. There will even be those who are sympathetic to the message that UK uncut has.

In this case, you have to accept that despite any disagreements you may have with the law, they had broken it. And it is the job of the police to stop people breaking the law, no matter the reasons why they are breaking the law. Its the duty the role entails.

As for why the black bloc folk got away, I suspect this was because the police didn't have the numbers to contain them and they simply ran away.

If as an English speaker you had a set of number to memorize say 8,5,7,11,3, 9,2 you say the words as they are written so that's eight, five, se-ven, ele-ven, three, nine, two and that takes us a couple of seconds, but in Asian languages they do it much much quicker because the words are shorter ( 4 is ""si, 7 is ""qi and so on ) basically when it comes to maths they're computing numbers a lot faster because they're dealing with shorter words. They can also memorize much longer sequences than we can because of this, the average in China is ten compared to our six. 

Also, their numeric system and the way they add is completely different to ours. They spell out numbers like this: 99 ( ninety nine ) in Asian is nine-tens-nine, 45 ( forty five ) is four-tens-five and so on

Therefore... if you add thirty seven and twenty two in your head in English you first have to convert the words to numbers (37 + 22 ) then you'd do the maths, 2 + 7 = 9 then 30 + 20 = 50,  so 50 + 9 = 59. 

However, the same sum in Asian when spelled out is three-tens-seven + two-tens-two so therefore they don't even need to convert the numbers it just becomes five-tens-nine i.e. it's a much quicker system.

This is the route Guy Richie took to evict the Really Free School from his place in Fitzrovia recently. Disobeying an IPO is a criminal offense.

The other route, if the building isn't currently being used, which is a more common squatting situation, is for the landowner to apply to the courts for a Possession Order. This can take a few weeks to a few months to come to court. If successful, the landlord will be issued a Warrant for Eviction, which allows them to hire bailliffs to evict anyone in the building.

A degree does not make you educated, it makes you middle class and nice.  That’s what employers mean when they say ""must have degree"" or ""graduate wanted"".

There are obvious exceptions for people like Doctors and Accountants but very few people doing physics (my degree) go on to actually do any physics.  They work in Finance or Engineering.  If that is true of physics, how much more true is it of English Lit?

Let me ask you, do you think if we compelled everyone to do a physics degree we would suddenly, spontaneously, get an extra million R&amp;D jobs a year or do you think you would just get more people not using 50 grand’s worth of education?

I hope this does not come across as aggressive, but I just really feel that its a waste of many peoples time, but as more people get degrees it will become impossible to get a decent job without one.

Firstly, we do have an elected government, one which is less than a year old. In Libya they have had a dictatorship lead by the same person for 40 years now. In the UK the protest is over an austerity drive to reduce public spending to affordable levels. In Libya the protests started over a totalitarian regime with frequent human rights abuses. If you remember back to the beginning of the protests, peaceful protests were met with snipers and mercenaries firing live rounds into the crowds, where as peaceful protests in the UK are allowed. Even violent protests in the UK are not met with a fraction of the brutality we've seen directed towards peaceful protests in Libya. 

So given that in the UK conditions are far far better than those in Libya, and even with the cuts will remain so, violent protest is the resort of a tiny minority of people, who do not have public support for their actions, and quite frankly are not even that violent.

Second, I think mst people doing ""graduate"" jobs dont need the degree they did.

We dont use our degrees, they just show that we are good at maths and can sit still in lectrues for 3 years.  (I imagine this is even more true of people with degrees like English Lit but thats not my field so...).

So the question is, do these ""graduate"" jobs actually require a degree or, with so many people having degrees, is it just an easier, more PC way of finding the people you want to employ than saying ""must be over 21, good and maths and not a dick""?  I think that for most jobs, it is the later.

if you need some funding to feed your family while you pursue this , try the following things

http://digitalderry.org/news/seedups-celebrates-us-launch/ ($5,000 up for grabs, make a 60 second pitch video)

http://ddseedcomp.eventbrite.com/ (longer contest with prize pool of $10,000 for people wanting to set up a business.) Launch is THIS Saturday so you'd have to compose yourself quickly.

You could try to setup something akin to a donate for / pay for access online comic portal.

Make the comic available digitally and you'll qualify for most of this funding.

Another thing to investigate is having the comic avail in Irish too, it's a big buzzword ATM and people like the Northern Ireland Art Council routinely sponsor / give out grants to people providing Irish content.. which all fits under the ""Culture"" umbrella nicely.

There's also a small comic book stall in the Richmond center. Some students don't know about it :)

I'll mention to a few peeps. Try also using #tweetni and #derry tags on twitter! 

*exhale*

Edit: Another idea, you could try to take a unique approach and make the comic native resolution ""smart phone friendly.""

You could start with the New Series 1 first episode (""Rose"") and just go from there.  If you don't like it much, try skipping to the series 2 Christmas Special (""The Christmas Invasion"") where David Tennant takes over as The Doctor and go from there.

Smith and Jones, the first episode of season 3, could be another good one that gives you the feel of the show.  It's both funny and suspenseful with two fun alien threats and lots of running.

true,[deleted],null,null,"Your friends didn't exactly do you justice by suggesting ""Blink"" as your first experience with Doctor Who. Is it a fantastic episode? Oh abso-fucking-lutely it is! But it's an absolutely horrible way to start watching the show. 

First off, it barely has The Doctor in it at all and thereby doesn't help you understand the main character. Secondly, it presumes you understand how the TARDIS works and really messes with the overall time-bending aspect of the show without a solid grounding in the rules the show itself follows. And lastly, and quite possibly most importantly, it sets an unhealthy precedent for the shows typical narrative style and overall feel; as shown by your primary question.

Doctor Who, as a whole, is a very hit and miss show. You can watch 2 amazing episodes back to back and then have to suffer through a horrible one and a few mediocre episodes directly after. Also, it's not nearly as scary or ""mindfuck-y"" as 'Blink"" makes it appear to be. The show typically jumps back and forth between quality science fiction, campiness, humor and scary sequences. It's a very unique blend that ""Blink"" doesn't really represent all that well. 

Starting you off with ""Blink"" would be like introducing someone to the Star Wars universe by only showing Jar Jar Binks scenes. Is it part of the movie series? Absolutely. Is it an accurate representation of it as a whole? Absolutely not.

If you'd like to give the show another go, I would suggest starting with the following episodes, in no particular order:

 * The Girl In The Fireplace

 * Midnight

 * Fathers Day

 * Tooth and Claw

I recommend these not because they're the cream of the crop (Though ""Girl In The Fireplace"" is in my top 3 favorite episodes.) but because they each offer a healthy mix of what the show is normally like, while staying on the medium/higher quality side.

Hope this helped!

 * The Girl In The Fireplace

I just love the writing and overall story. It's wonderfully self-contained, we're able to take the threat seriously while easily accepting the humor and though the ending is a bit over dramatic, I love that they never find out what caused them to stalk her. It really represents the show as a whole, nearly perfectly.

 * Human Nature/The Family of Blood

The acting on Tennant's part is near pitch perfect, same goes for the individual who played Baines. Damn, that guy is creepy. The villains have a simple objective and they're believable. Plus it's one of the only episodes that's insanely emotional without focusing on RTD's obsession with Rose/""Lonely Doctor Syndrome"". Absolutely one of my favorites.
 
 * The Hungry Earth/Cold Blood

To be fair, I would've picked a different episode as my third but I found it only right to pick a single episode, a two parter and a Smith episode as well. These were my favorite of Season 5 because it really helped define Smith's Doctor for me.

Tennant and Freema and the actress who plays Joan are all amazing, though.  

In the Hungry Earth/Cold Blood, almost all of the guest characters (Everyone except Doctor/Amy/Rory) are really annoying and at least two have NO redeeming qualities, and they just ruin the episodes for me.  I usually don't hate the characters who are only in one or two episodes, but I just can't stand most of them.  My favorite thing about those episodes is actually Rory.

I would recommend watching the episode called ""The girl in the fireplace.""  This was one of my favorites.  Not a scary episode but very clever.

Edit:  How did I forget this one ""The Empty Child.""  Definitely one of the scariest.

I mean when you look at it, it's the perfect tabloid story: Person with no job sponging through taxes from those who work 9-5 every day of their lives. You have a victim and a faceless perpetrator you can attack with no possible comeback from libel. It's a column filler, a dead space occupier and it'll always guarantee readers. 

The thing that pisses me off however is how many people bought it and how it's effecting our unemployed right now, they've been outed as some sort of criminals, enough in fact for our government to fuck them over for their own poll ratings. 

The question I'll always put though: If your average unemployed man was given the chance to shine in a £150,000/ year job would they take it? Well of course they fucking would, trouble is though, they'll never get that opportunity because circumstance has left them in the gutter.
