[One of my favorite moments of that episode is when we see a hand snatch Amelia's drink. Later, she's complaining that she's thirsty, so the Doctor goes back in time and snatches her drink. The only reason the Doctor does that though is because she's thirsty, because he snatched her drink earlier, because she was thirsty, because he snatched her drink earlier, etc. :) I think Moffat sometimes just enjoys playing with the wibbly wobbly mechanics of time travel paradoxes.  ](/spoiler) 

I would consider the Father's Day thing to be a sort of one-off in some ways. As strong as the episode was, I don't think it should be a regular thing that weird gargoyle time creatures should appear every time a paradox occurs. It's probably best to just think of that as a special circumstance as the Doctor has crossed back on his own time stream before that without them.  Just imagine that they were in the area at the time or something and everything happened to align just right for them to appear. :) It would be a shame for what happened in one episode to hamper some really cool wibbly wobbly stuff for the rest of the series.

If nothing else, we might not agree on everything but I would defend to the death your right to express your view, and in this modern age it is so refreshing that you have one.

In answer to your first point I would say yes we cannot afford retirement and healthcare. The scope of both has expanded considerably. If it is easier for you to comprehend, how about the idea that Alan Sugar is entitled to the same as the rest of us even though he is obviously richer?

I think it's a complex question with complex solutions.

Your idea of public capitalism is interesting but ultimately appears to be an extension of paying one person to dig holes and another to fill them in.

Your point on who pays for what - increasing taxation affects you, not philip green. Government ownership of industries decreases GDP because people don't invest in communist or communist-leaning states. Opening up the NHS will generate private sector investment, but that's not necessarily what we want. On the other hand, railway investment would probably be a good thing.

If you increase taxation you're going to pay more - as a student, this is where your university fees would be going as that subsidy that's disappeared is now going to the tax bill. I find it interesting that the thing that makes money (banking) is not discussed amongst your idea of socialist businesses.

After all this I could easily be called a bastard, an arsehole or a cunt but the fact is that I want the same things you do.

By getting a student loan, like those of us paying Â£3k/year do. Except we'll be paying it back for earning minimum wage, you'll have to earn a slightly more comfortable salary first.

I agree with the idea of making cuts, but it is all about where and how much. The coalition hasn't been too hot on making proper decisions, rather more knee-jerk ones. Part of this might be because very few of our politicians have any real world experience (preferably in industry) - and this is an issue for *all* parties. Pick any high-level politician from any of the three main parties, it is likely that they have a degree in PPE from Oxford, and went around in Parliamentary circles before being elected an MP. Many of them have had a fairly privileged upbringing too. Get rid of them.

BTW: Wasn't the report that said we should increase tuition fees (I don't recall who wrote it) actually commissioned by the Labour government? Oh, and it was Labour who introduced fees in the first place and then hiked them up. So it's not just the coalition to blame here.

Everyone looks away without having a *reason* to look away.  If they *did* see one, they wouldn't just immediately turn their head away.

On top of all of that, it's important to realize we have only seen them in two time periods before.  We saw them in the '60s, and we saw one when the Doctor was killed.  We know the tunnels they inhabit have been around for centuries, so they've probably been on Earth for a while, but that doesn't mean they're absolutely *everywhere.*  Living inside the Tardis seems particularly unlikely.

People have said that he's lost count, but (and this is from Big Finish audio, so take this as you will) the Eighth Doctor stated that Time Lords always know exactly how much time has passed, no matter what.  It's a sense to them, like sight, hearing, touch, taste, or smell to us.  When he was trapped in the Divergent Universe, which had no linear time, he said that he felt like he'd lost a part of himself - akin to going blind, or deaf.

true,Atman00,null,null,"&gt;The Tardis? I don't know if your sound was off but ""Silence Will Fall"" was spoken, clearly, within the Tardis itself. I'd also point out that when the door's opened and closed with no explanation, if it were just a random occurrence why would they bother to do the post-production required for an outdoor shooting just to make sure we heard the door close?

They say the Tardis was being controlled by an *external* force.  (Doors included.)  I think the ""Silence Will Fall"" voice was coming over the Tardis's speakers, not from a creature hiding in the Tardis itself.  This makes even more sense when you consider that the Tardis exploded right after that.  Whatever said ""Silence Will Fall"" probably didn't want to blow itself up.

&gt;And as for every single time period-- well, we know we can safely assume they're in 2011 on back and into history, since that's when they're mentioned.

Well, they were only mentioned by the booming voice in the Tardis, and while the Tardis itself was in 2010 when the voice sounded, you can't really draw any conclusions about what time period the voice *originated.*

However, there was the Silent watching the Doctor when the astronaut shot him.  That's one I missed.  So yeah, they are around in the present, and clearly backward from there.  I am still quite curious as to why their Tardis was abandoned in the Lodger, though.

&gt;If the Weeping Angels and the Prisoner Zero are both aware of the Silence, then yes, we can safely assume the Silents are transgalactic.

Prisoner Zero in the year 2010 and The Weeping Angels of 5140 also knew of the Pandorica.  However, the Pandorica didn't exist in either of those time periods.  They knew because it was significant to the Doctor's future, but it still didn't exist in the time periods they mentioned it.

As to the Silents being all over the place, I don't necessarily disagree with that, I'm just saying we can't take it for granted as true, which a lot of people seem to be doing.  

I'm not arguing that they aren't all over the place, manipulating everything.  I'm arguing the instances cited aren't strong evidence that we've seen them.

I think the Silent there killing Joy was not so much a display of evil, but a way of getting rid of what was a nuisance to it (and also possibly a red herring to make it seem that The Silence is malicious). And there's the scene where River's in the tunnels and encounters like, 4 of them. They could've easily killed her there. 

Not to mention, with their super ability of making you forget them unless you were looking at them - great horror concept, by the way - if they were after the Doctor or his companions, it'd have been insanely easy to grab them at anytime. Remember, the Doctor and Martha got caught by the weeping angels, so a monster he couldn't even *remember* should've had almost no trouble.

And I think the message to Amy from the Silent in the bathroom was meant to be helpful. I think the problem is that these guys have no clue how to interact with humans (see also: Joy) and they end up blundering it big time.

An important question to ask is whether the Doctor knows that his companions interacted with a future self already?

Hell, he figured out Amelia was special and her family was missing in under ten minutes.

- an end to tactical voting, votes will still be wasted, tactical voting will still happen/be encouraged
* MPs working harder
+ an end to expenses fraud
- extremists having power
* the likelihood of second votes being of influence ( yet alone the mad maths of third votes )
+ a stepping stone to PR ( blah blah chance generation *cough* *second referendum since Moses*), in fact maybe the opposite - a low turnout would even call the whole thing into question
-  anything vaguely fair, it could make things worse
* a more expensive system
+ guaranteed 50% of the vote for an MP
- a sweeping change to safe seats or the debacle of elections concentrated in a comparative handful of seats making some votes worth more
* a distraction from the real issues that are going to really hurt liberty
+ better MPs, more likely the least offensive MP not necessarily the best, probably the one that tows the party line better
- a more complicated system

  * How is The Doctor going to live past 1100? Smith clearly isn't going to be the Final Doctor, so how does Moffatt undo the death without Yet Another WWTW?

  * What was that goo-covered table for in Florida? It was clearly meant to hold a humanoid and fit something over its head. There was also a lot of medical equipment near it. Was it used *by* The Slient? *on* The Silent?

  * Why did River say ""of course not"" after she failed to kill the spaceman in the lake? **If** the person in the spacesuit was a younger River (a la the River-was-in-jail-for-killing-The-Doctor theory) was it because, even though her heart was angry, her mind knew that she would miss the target because she'd already lived through the scene?

  * Was the not-a-TARDIS related to The Lodger, or was it just a reused set? Do it and the worldwide tunnels belong to The Silent?

  * What do the Silent do down there in the dark tunnels, sitting in a circle with their arms crossed?

  * Is Amy *really* pregnant? Why did she have to tell The Doctor *right then*? Why was it so important to say it then while CED3 was being attacked and a child was calling for help?

  * Probably-won't-be-answered dept: If the 1100 yo Doctor doesn't have a TARDIS, how did he send an invidation to the 900yo Doctor?

  * How was a small child able to fill out an adult-sized spacesuit? Is there something more going on there, such as the Silent changing the child's body? Or is it just a minor plot hole?

It was never there until Russell Davies took the helm, and the show was not worse for the lack of it before that happened.

I posted a diatribe against **excessive** gayness on doctor who - as a matter of fact, if you go back and read my comment again you'll notice that I **at first** thought it was fine. It's only after viewers got hit in the face with it every fucking episode that I started getting tired of it. A lot of times it didn't have to be said and it felt forced.

It's not a *choice* that they make; it's something that they absolutely must do by way of quantum physics.

And thus is the real crux of the problem in Series 5. The thing that ultimately *dooms* the angels in Blink is that once they were maneuvered into a situation where they could each see each other, they were forever forced into stone, because they, as living things, could see each other, and therefore they MUST turn to stone. But in The Time of Angels, they could all see each other, and that had absolutely no impact on their abilities to move or switch back and forth. Their entire weakness that led to their downfall in their initial showing was completely wiped away in their second appearance.

I don't think it's something to be avoided. But deliberately (and awkwardly) mentioning it in EVERY FUCKING EPISODE is just as bad. Acknowledge that it's there, don't make it something that your audience knows is coming.

Actually, you know what the issue is, I think? Most people don't care if your preferences lie elsewhere to their own. This, however, conflicts with the deep-seated desire held by many, many gay people for attention. Look at us, we're so flamboyant, they say.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt;In answer to your first point I would say yes we cannot afford retirement and healthcare. The scope of both has expanded considerably. 

So you honestly believe that it is an impossibility to provide it, or that it is not worth the investment? If necessary, free healthcare could end at 80 with optional euthanasia, even that is better than leaving people with the risk of no healthcare at all throughout their lives (as does happen in the US).

&gt;Your idea of public capitalism is interesting but ultimately appears to be an extension of paying one person to dig holes and another to fill them in

Not really, as there is no need to pay people for unnecessary work if it is all collectively owned. We can automate as much work as possible, hire and train the unemployed and then lower the working hours, this is much more logical than overworking some people whilst leaving others without work.

&gt;Government ownership of industries decreases GDP because people don't invest in communist or communist-leaning states.

But the government can manage that investment when it owns the capital to do so. For example, the government could invest in the railway infrastructure, and this is probably more logical, as the railway infrastructure is a natural monopoly and so privatising it is troublesome (as is the rail travel itself to some extent, the Oxford bus system was a nightmare with the competing companies using the same station but not eachothers' tickets) so collective ownership is favourable to all on these natural monopolies (utility companies included).

Increasing taxation can affect the property and business owners like Phillip Green, I don't see why you think that's an impossibility. Sure they usually pass the cost on to the consumer, but that can only be done if there is little competition. Although really I am in favour of nationalisation replacing taxation anyway, as it's easier and more logical (and ethical considering that no-one created the land and resources themselves), this includes the banks, where nationalisation or collectivisation (in to co-operatives) would help to prevent the instability in the sector (although the fundamental problem behind this is the inequality itself).

Of course people mostly want the same thing. But at the moment it seems that we are regressing in the first-world, due to competition with China, etc. and the businesses are using the abundance of labour to drive down wages, taxes and working conditions as much as they can, and this monopolisation of power to a few interests should not be accepted.",0,1303715294,null,0,false,0,c1qvi2j,t3_gvv92,t1_c1qvi2j,t1_c1qsxb7,1427092117,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

&gt; So you honestly believe that it is an impossibility to provide it, or that it is not worth the investment? If necessary, free healthcare could end at 80 with optional euthanasia, even that is better than leaving people with the risk of no healthcare at all throughout their lives (as does happen in the US).

Absolutely not. But what we have is a system that's had a lot of mission creep over the years. Breast augmentation on the NHS for example, should we do it? On the one hand people have real mental health body issues and can't afford it. On the other, it's not really a life threatening condition (in the physical sense of the word). Another question about the NHS is that it's free to all, even the Phillip Greens of the world. I think that a long and hard discussion needs to be had by those who can change the NHS regarding what and who treatment is provided for. I use the NHS and I don't need to. I could get private healthcare but I don't. To me this doesn't feel right, I'd much rather pay two thirds of the NHS cost but not have access except for emergencies and make the rest up with private cover. I'm sure there's other ways of doing the NHS that are better too, but at the moment anyone who suggests changing the NHS gets shouted down and it precludes rational discussion.",0,1303721343,null,0,false,0,c1qvqqv,t3_gvv92,t1_c1qvqqv,t1_c1qvi2j,1427092230,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

Â£136.00 using the retail price index

Â£314.00 using average earnings

Not sure how far that takes us though?  If we take the modal average annual wage in the UK today - guestimate, let's say, for argument, Â£14k, that's about Â£270 a week (for slightly fewer hours maybe).  Of course, that's not factoring holiday entitlements etc. either.

Edit: Another way of looking at it is the current minimum wage is 5.80 pounds per hour for those over 22, 4.83 pounds for those between 18-21 and 3.27 pounds per hour for all workers under the age of 18.  So multiply those up by 46.4 (the hours in the 1960 example) and you get Â£269ish, Â£224ish, and Â£150ish respectively.  Please feel free to check my maths, it's not my strong suit!

Edit 2: As I imply above though, this isn't the whole story by any means, as the impact of inflation isn't even, some things are progressively outstripping earnings - the most obvious example being [accommodation](http://www.guardian.co.uk/money/2010/jan/20/house-prices-britain-property), which is a large and relatively irreducible component of people's household budgets.

Properly, for production purposes, I believe The Christmas Invasion is ""Episode 2.0"" (i.e., outside of the second series/season), so the '5th Episode"" would be ""Rise of the Cybermen"".  However, you could be referring to the episode before that, ""The Girl In The Fireplace"".

Yesterday ""P_I_P"" [asked](http://www.reddit.com/r/doctorwho/comments/gw638/best_doctor_who_episode/) /r/doctorwho ""best Doctor Who episode?"", said it was The Girl In The Fireplace, and got upset when not everyone agreed.  I recall at the time my wife and I watched it originally we were entertained, and thought it quite good.  And when we went back and re-watched that entire season at one point, we felt similarly entertained again.  But the episode hasn't stuck with either of us so much that we have ever gone back to watch just it, like we have other episodes.  It's not a ""must see"" for us or anything.

Now the 2-part ""Rise of the Cybermen"" and ""Age of Steel"" has been a splendid way of re-introducing the Doctor's second-worst enemies, and was followed up by the season-ender ""Army of Ghosts"" and ""Doomsday"". We've rewatched these several times. 

Still, my favorite episode of the second series is ""School Reunion"", and has been long before last week's unexpected death of Elisabeth Sladen.  I've lost count of how many times I've watched it.  Maybe it's just because I'm an old-school fan of the classic series, and that Sarah Jane was the first Companion I ever knew.

* He knows where and when he's been. could have sent an invite to himself when he was living with James Corden in the lodger.

* Not a plot hole. There's obviously something there but that's something I don't think has been considered when discussing if River, etc is in there.

* Because suits are cool

* because he thinks it's called Jefferson.

* We see a silent on the hill at the start, we then see one in the whitehouse that appears to know what happened there.  Did he travel with them in the Tardis?

* Will River be able to remember what happened to Rory

* The silents were obviously what was above the house in the lodger as not only is the spaceship the same but the effect when someone is killed is, i.e. the flickering lights etc.

  * The painting session, the Laurel and Hardy movie, and the WWII tunnel all happened on Earth within the last 200 years.

  * Amy didn't remember Joy, so River probably won't remember Rory.. unless (1) she records something on her instruments or (2) being asked about him by Amy and the Doctor stirs some memory.

  * The Silents probably aren't what happens to people after they've been tested as incompatible with the not-a-TARDIS. The chronology is wrong -- the Lodger's ship had only tested a handful of people, and River said the tunnels are hundreds of years old.

The overall shape of the people and objects are pretty good but the shading looks a little rushed and unfinished. Try [cross-hatching](http://www.bigtimeattic.com/blog/uploaded_images/bta_crosshatch_styles.jpg) in different directions to avoid the lines of different levels of shading. What you'e started to do on Atlee's neck looks better because there is different direction. You could keep it loose and more scratchy but your style seems to have thicker shading so a more thorough method seems appropriate to me.

Atlee is actually pretty spot on but it looks a little like his moustache is unfinished, perhaps spread it a little bit more to the left, a few pencil strokes should do it. I would also try and extended his left shoulder slightly and make it less rigid and straightlined at the bottom to match the faded effect you have with Churchill.

As for ol' Winston, without sounding mean (because I genuinely think its a nice drawing) something is not quite right. Without starting him again I would give him more eyebags, he had quite crinkly, squinty [eyes](http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcRtBgCjQJD00hpnxo00c9AuWUXTtHU6MCFJEXmTPj7hk9l-0xIA) and maybe add a bit more to the jowly effect you already have, also thicken the cigar and add more definition, the colour of a cigar is darker brown so should have more shading so you can differentiate more easily from his skintone.

I've mentioned a lot of things but its actually not a bad drawing. You could submit to /r/art and probably get more upvotes, I don't think /r/unitedkingdom is that patriotic :/

Labour majority

**Aberconwy**
Con 35.8%
Labour 24.5%
Libdem 19.3%
Plaid 17.8%
UKIP 2.1%
Indep 0.5%

Apart from the bottom 2.1% of votes for UKIP, the non-Conservative (two thirds) of votes were for central/left-wing parties. If this was under AV, there is almost no chance the Conservatives would win.

**Aberdeen North**
labour - 44.5% - almost certain labour win

**Aberdeen South**

Labour 36.5	%
Liberal Democrat	28.4%
Conservative 20.7%
Scottish National Party	11.9%
British National Party 1.2%
Green 1.0%
Scotland Against Crooked Lawyers 0.3%

A hugely split vote, which could go to either the Lib Dems or Labour.

**Aberdeenshire West &amp; Kincardine**
Lib Dems - 38.5%, likely to win with the support of 2nd preferences from Labour and/or SNP.

**Airdrie &amp; Shotts**
Labour majority

**Aldershot**
Conservative win, with the support of the Christian Party, English Independence Party and UKIP.

**Amber Valley**

Stalemate between Conservatives and Labour at 38.6% and 37.4% - the winner being decided by the second preferences of the BNP and Lib Dems. Likely Labour win.

**Arfon**
Close call between Plaid Cymru and Labour - the second preferences of the LibDems and Conservatives would decide the winner. Who would win is anyone's guess.

**Ashfield**
An interesting constituency where the vote is split almost 1/3 by Labour, LibDem and conservative (with a small C) split votes. Assuming the smaller conservative parties vote Conservative, there is a three party tie between Labour, LibDems and Conservative. How the Con vote would be redistributed in the next round is anyone's guess, but it looks like the LibDem 2nd preference would likely push Labour to a 50%+ win.

**Birmingham Hall Green**
A labour win with just 32.9% of the vote, there is a considerable chance that Respect-Unity coalition could win. A third of the Conservative vote, and two thirds of the Lib Dem vote would secure the seat.

There was not something gay in ""every fucking episode"" of Doctor Who.  I should know, I watched every fucking episode of Doctor Who.  The fact that you're seeing a lot more gay than there really was says something about your negative reaction to it, not to the actual content of the episodes.

Second:
&gt;the deep-seated desire held by many, many gay people for attention

You rely on stereotypes to make your argument, and you expect people to take your ideas seriously?  There are some gay people who want attention.  There are just as many straight people who want attention.  What gay people DO tend to want as a group, though, is to not be ignored as if we don't exist.  95% of television shows like to pretend the whole world is heterosexual (though it is slowly getting better).  So can you really blame us for enjoying it when a show actually validates our existence?

There's a common statement people make with regards to gay people: ""I don't have anything against them, as long as they're not in my face about it.""  Of course, by ""in my face"" what they mean is that they dare to do the same things heterosexual people do - hold hands, kiss, see positive representations of themselves on TV.  Now, whether or not that's how you MEANT to come off, that's what you sound like.  Maybe, if you don't want to sound like you're trotting out the same old homophobic statements us gay people have heard dozens of times in our lives, you should really think a bit about how you phrase things.

At the end of the day, I just can't understand why you would come on here because of your love for Doctor Who, and then attack someone else who was also expressing a love for Doctor Who, just because you disagree with his reasons for doing so.

WHY her pregnancy would be important to the Doctor or the Silence, I have no idea, but that seemed to be what it was alluding to, based on Amy's reactions.

Interestingly, I don't think that Rory knows about the pregnancy. As much as he worries about Amy's safety, I don't think he'd let her anywhere near the Doctor if he knew she was pregnant.

true,3gv,null,null,"**I, for one, love it.** It's a show about time travel and I'm glad to see time travel being used more. Moffat loves playing with time travel and having events happen out of sequence. We don't get all the plot in the right order, so we're confused. Characters don't all experience time the right order, so someone's always confused. Wrapping my mind around paradoxes is more interesting &amp; entertaining than 'Time Dragons'.  
  
In *The Impossible Astronaut*, River makes it very clear that they cannot [tell the doctor he will die](/spoiler) because the universe could be destroyed from the paradox. Amy replies, [""he's done it before"" and Rory says, ""to be fair, the universe *did* end.""](/spoiler) Classic. So the question on my mind is if that picnic scene is a result of the paradox or won't happen because of the paradox?  
  
Last season, [everything that happened between the discovery and destruction of the crack in the universe arguably never really happened. Well, not to us who experience time linearly.](/spoiler) But the characters grew. Moffat is (presumably) in the middle of a very classic writing trick: reversing the characters' roles.  
* Last season, the audience experienced the show through Amy's perspective and the Doctor was a few steps ahead of us. This season, Amy and the audience know something the Doctor doesn't know (Though the Doctor is probably still a few steps ahead of us).  
* River knows the Doctor's future and has been very mysterious because of it. She's now stated that [each time the audience sees her, we're going to know a bit more and she'll know a bit less.](/spoiler)  
  
Whatever happens later in this season, it's going to be big. Huge massive big. It's been hinted at since River Song was first introduced. The Ninth Doctor died because [he didn't clean up after the events on Satellite 5](/spoiler) and that's just a forward progression in time. The Eleventh Doctor is dealing with River Song and every time they meet, it's technically a paradox. In *Forest of the Dead*, River 'remembers' when Doctor opened the TARDIS by snapping his fingers. He does it at the end of that episode but more importantly, he does it for Amy and simply says ""Come with me"".  
  
I really need to get back to work so in closing: the Doctor, aided by his paradoxical friend River, is going to obtain a higher mastery of time travel this season. Just you wait.

First things first, we learned from River that the Doctor can't interfere in his own timeline and create a paradox.  It's a no no.  He can do stuff, but no paradoxes because they would destroy the universe.

We also know from the Library that a fully knowledgeable Doctor, aware of all the events between him and River sees her before she goes to the Library and gives her a sonic screwdriver.

River doesn't have a screwdriver yet, therefore the Doctor hasn't given it to her, therefore she hasn't met that one yet.  Therefore he can't be dead because if he did die before that he would never have known River song  and we get all nice and paradoxy.

The UK (with England as its predecessor state), for centuries until 1922, large parts or all of Ireland. For that time, the UK were not particularly nice to the Irish - racism against them was common and plenty of times the English/British were guilty of gross negligence or even outright violence towards the Irish and many, many Irish people died as a result. These years were interspersed with wars of rebellion and violence against England/the UK.

Desire for Home Rule in Ireland (think devolution) began to grow and by the late 19th Century was a key issue in parliament. In 1914 the bill passed but home rule was suspended due to the First World War. After the war, there was a massive rise in support for Irish republicans. There was a two-year guerrilla war ending in renewed home rule with a parliament for Southern Ireland (predominantly republican Catholic) and Northern Ireland (predominantly unionist and Protestant) with the promise of a vote in both parliaments on independence. It should be noted that the protestants in Northern Ireland were mostly descended from settlers who came to Ireland from Scotland and England. In 1922, Southern Ireland voted for independence, the north against, surprising no one, though the constitution of Ireland asserted sovereignty over Northern Ireland.

Fast forward to the sixties, Catholics were a minority that was widely discriminated against and republican terrorists began a campaign of terrorism to achieve separation from the UK who they see as colonial oppressors. The British government brought the troops in (big mistake) and suspended the Northern Irish parliament which again galvanised support for the republicans amongst the Catholics. 

This kept on going, with the British and Irish governments barely on speaking terms (though they did oppose the terrorism) until the nineties when things had begun to calm down with many of the root causes of discontent solved or ameliorated (Catholics are not really discriminated against in Northern Ireland now - not by the state anyway).

The Good Friday agreement brought the Irish republicans and their political allies (Sinn Fein) into Northern Irish government in a power-sharing arrangement with a new Northern Ireland Assembly and the Republic of Ireland relinquished its claim to Northern Ireland. 

Terrorism was at an all-time low, the Troubles (as the period since the sixties was known) were largely over. But recently, a spate of attacks has indicated that a core of republicans are still willing to use violence to achieve their aims of separating from the UK (and ideally joining the republic, but there's not much appetite for taking over the north in the republic; nor in the North).

Same for Kakuta, as he's only managed four appearances total for Fulham, and hasn't gotten any goals or assists during his time there. Needs more time to develop before we pull him back into the spotlight that is Chelsea.

Drogba and Torres should be great to lead the attack for most of our games, with Kalou and Sturridge being able to play there as well, although I think both are suited to more of a secondary attacking role, or being pushed out wide slightly. I'm still not convinced that Neymar will be good, Luiz, Alex and Ramires are all 'strong' players, but even Ramires took a while to adapt to the physicality.

Sometimes connections exist - like the brilliant Doctor wearing his jacket scene from the angels episode last season - but at the same time be aware that you may be disappointed looking for threads.

Moffat has deliberately done these things in order to keep fans hooked and talking. Some are legitimate but you won't know until the end. Some of the best episodes of the series have been the ones he's written and by the time Silence in the Library was penned, he knew he was taking over the franchise. 

There are very clear connections, while possibly meaningless, *are* there and trying to rain on the speculation discussion parade is rather condescending. 

Have you seen the screenshots from The Lodger? It's a legitimate comparison and speculation. The writers *want* this stuff happening because it keeps millions of viewers speculating and tuning in.

Correct

Yup. I made a post tracking the number of times things were said, as well as going through the past series... [Here's](http://www.reddit.com/r/doctorwho/comments/gx93l/silence_will_fall_and_some_other_theories/) the link, btw.

I think they're seperate... or at least from what I gathered

true,adamant2009,eccleston,Eccleston,"Something that a lot of people are glossing over is a specific line from the next episode -- ""We're not fighting an alien invasion, we're leading a revolution.""

To me, this implies that the Silence are definitely a threat. Not only a threat -- River said the tunnels had been there for a long time. This revolution is against a race that has been subtlely influencing the American government, if not the governments of the world, for some time. The Saturnynians saw them beyond the crack, as did others (I can only remember them specifically for the time being), so they don't seem to belong, but they've been here a very long time. They took control of the TARDIS, for goodness' sake, so they're capable of some feats. So it comes down to fighting off a threat that you forget as soon as you turn away, a threat that all of the races of all of the systems in the universe may have been fighting for aeons without even realizing it. This seems to me a fairly good reason why the Feds seem to be chasing Rory as well -- the Silence have been manipulating silently for a very, very long time, and the Doctor and his Companions pose a fair threat. Whether they're a malevolent force or not, however, is yet to be determined. They certainly have the full capabilities at their disposal to be incredibly dangerous and incredibly powerful. So we'll see how that pans out.

It seems pretty obvious to me that the only way that the Companions can deal with the Silence is to tally themselves every time they see one. People have tried comparing the tallies to the writing in ""The Impossible Planet"", but I think in this case the simplest explanation suits it. They're counting the number of times they've seen them.

I'm not sure what to think about the astronaut. Either she's not in control of the suit or the suit is manipulating her, that's my guess. Hard to say.

My concern is this -- How in Hell did the Doctor grow a beard when held in captivity by the government? How long must that mean he's been kept there? His current body doesn't seem the type to grow a beard in a week or two, you know?

CRAZY SPECULATION AT HAND: We're told that the deal with River is supposed to be resolved in this season. I'm not convinced that the first astronaut we see *is* the little girl. Going back to my earlier thought -- if the suit is somehow manipulating the user, maybe somehow the girl gets saved, but at a cost. River has to wear the suit. And in doing so, she has to kill the Doctor. We've all at least speculated that River kills the Doctor, so perhaps that's it. That's what sends her to prison, even though she had no control over her actions, and thus she killed the Doctor (speculation as to whether or not he actually died permanently aside) toward the end of her timeline but at the VERY end of his. I say it like that because, for the most part, they're traveling in opposite directions, but in the case of the 1100-year-old Doctor they're not. It's something that he had to do, dangerous though it was to interact with his own timeline, for whatever it may have been that needed to be accomplished to be so. At this point I'm getting somewhat brain-damaged, and this is getting long-winded, so I'll stop. But there's my speculation for the week.",0,1303771089,null,0,false,0,c1qz5gf,t3_gx207,t1_c1qz5gf,t3_gx207,1427093837,3,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,3

&gt; Bertrand has spent most of his Chelsea career out on loan, developing while playing every day. He is the current first choice lb for the england u21 team, and has been very impressive almost everywhere he has gone. The only experience he is missing is playing every day in the top flight. Chelsea seem to be very confident in his abilities, and I could easily see him play his way into the first team (and effectively zhirkov's spot) with a good preseason. Either that or a loan to a premier league team, but I don't think he is as far off as you make it seem. Van aanholt is I think behind Bertrand in the pecking order, but both are loaded with potential. Zhirkov won't get much better, and doesn't fit too well in a 4-3-3 midfield, especially with the excess of attacking options it looks like we could have next year. As such, I could easily see him leaving.

He does have a lot of promise, but as you could see with our youth policy this year, you don't want to put too much dependence on them if they're not ready for it. If we sell of Zhirkov and name Bertrand (or van Aanholt) as Cole's backup, and Cole goes down...well that's a lot of pressure for a young kid, especially at a club like Chelsea where every minute on the pitch is analyzed and judged. One poor performance, even one poor play could ruin a kid's confidence and set his development back by a number of years. I think that became clear and Carlo was reluctant to play the youth players too much after he realized the pressure being put on the players. 

I think a lot of these kids definitely have a future here and I want to see them play in a Chelsea shirt, but I think next year might be fast for many of them. Bruma was a little shaky so shipping him out on loan to a club with a spotlight that's less bright is good for him and his development. Sturridge is ready, he's shown that. Borini may not come back next year but he may be good for a fringe role. Kakuta has been lackluster so maybe another loan move is in his best interest. I'm not sure if either Bertrand or van Aanholt are ready for Chelsea yet, I would consider shipping both out to EPL teams.

* Instinctively, we want to protect children.  Also, we all were children.  Therefore, it makes sense to use children and their voices to make people engage with an event.  Jamie was a child lost, without a mother.  Almost everyone feared losing a parent as a child, and parents fear losing their children.  Not a trick, but rather a pair of universal feelings.

* What's in the dark?  What's just out of the corner of your eye?  What's behind you?  We rely on vision so much, that we instinctively fear what we *can't* see.  Again, common thread of universal fear.

* Lastly, time can be rewritten.  They've showed that.  Waters of Mars, Fires of Pompeii. . .things can change.  Rules change.  Call it a deus ex if you want, but also think of it as free will.

The arc holds over though all his series and this is fairly backed up by the mentions of ""silence will fall"" in the previous series.

In fact he practically begs you to go back and have a look by throwing in so many references to older episodes where he was head writer or episode writer that he's trying to make you think he has left little clues everywhere.

Among the episodes referenced are Blink, silence in the library/forest of the dead, the eleventh hour, The lodger, The pandorica opens/the big bang, and I'm positive I missed some.  I'm not saying that it will be hugely significant but it will probably blow your mind by the end of the series, even if it's just something subtle.

Your pic?  He did end all alone there.  10 ended all alone, 11 started over.  

Joss would be great with this show.  He does fantastic at putting little foreshadowy bits through an entire season and still leaving you going WHOA at the end.  Hell, he had blue sun stuff in the first episode of Firefly, planning for season 2, but ended up having to use them in Serenity the movie.  Two by two, hands of blue is way back in the Train Job, brought back briefly in Ariel, and then abandoned due to cancellation.  He'd planned on a lot more with Inara (the needle and thing in Serenity the episode) and on possibly revealing bits of Book.  Just to completely discount your theory - Kaylee lived.  

Joss only does the deaths (permanent deaths) when they'll drive the other characters to do something, or make the story drive a certain way.  Well, that and to really have your fans thrown off.  Tara's death fuels Willow, Book's fuels Mal, and Wash's convinces watchers that really, anyone can die at this point.  This really is that serious a mission and all that.  If you go on a life or death mission, it ends with absolutely no sacrifice (not necessarily death) and this happens over and over again, where's the tension?

So: Like I said, Rose may have fallen in, but she would have been retrieved/brought back into the story somehow to help with the story later, Martha would not have been killed by Lucy (really, why the hell would Lucy kill Martha anyway?), Donna would have ended exactly the same, Rory might have been killed off, but only after all the roman bit and only if he didn't need Amy pregnant later, Amy would have been the same, and yes, he still would have been alone as 10 at the end.

FWIW, I've been noticing that *throughout* the site today. Weird.

Anyway, I completely agree with your main point. It's one of the great things about Who, in my opinion -- you can have total camp in one episode, tearjerking drama in the next, and as a fan you're not required to be well-versed in the lore to enjoy it, because the internal consistency takes second seat to **good storytelling.**

The 1200 y/o Doctor was killed by... wait for it, The Doctor.  More accurately the 900 y/o Doctor who after all is said and done in the next episode will figure out that the Silent is around, has a TARDIS, needs a time-lord, and won't take no for an answer.  We know that the Silent was at the lake when the Doctor was shot.  We know that the Doctor will use his companions emotions to sell a scene.  The Silent had to buy the death, see the body burning, and that no time-lord meant no TARDIS and probably the end of that species (didn't it look like the Silent was sick and dying in the tunnels?).


So Who is the little girl in the suit?  Not Amy's baby ( I doubt she really is pregnant), Not a young river, not anything but a rouge Silent who had to figure out a way to communicate with someone and have them remember them.  Basically its a Silent in the suit, projecting the image and sound of a child.  This factors into the MIB Silent witnessing the Doctor's murder.  He knows who the Rouge Silent is and seeing his own murder their last hope is the final nail in the coffin... ahem, I mean TARDIS.

This is leading to the Doctor having to figure out a date for his future self to make the sacrifice, dawning a space suit (foreshadowed when he put it on his head last episode), parking the TARDIS underwater, opening the door, walking to shore, shooting the Future Doctor, absorbing future Doctors regeneration energy (and therefor his memories?), and selling the scene to the Silent who can shrivel up and die once and for all.


The end, onto the third episode.

""I find it a constant source of amusement how everyone and their dog still seem to be under the impression that we have no money.

""We can't afford his fee"", ""We can't afford his wages"", ""We can't outbid so-and-so"" - it's all bollocks. We have money. Our owners are prepared to spend money to get us back to the top, and at the moment they're yet to really show this in any way. We sold Babel and Torres and we replaced them with Suarez and Carroll, for a net outlay of around Â£1m. There wasn't even a plan to sell Torres, and we've already been told by inside sources that we were looking at trying to sign Aguero, knowing full well that he would cost Â£40m and demand high wages.

We're not paupers anymore. We're not under a pathetic penny-pinching regime anymore. We now have resources, and we'll now compete. Over the last 12 months Ian Ayre has secured sponsorship and kit deals worth an extra Â£25m per season. There's one world-class player per season we wouldn't have had before.

I really don't get why everyone keeps saying it. There's a shit load of sense in signing someone like Aguero, no matter how much it costs. The marketing and shirt sales alone starts to pay off the fee, and then you factor in his age. He's the perfect signing, and one I'm absolutely confident we could afford and would be willing to splash the cash on.""",0,1303799565,null,0,false,0,c1r1eea,t3_gxlbu,t1_c1r1eea,t3_gxlbu,1427094961,1,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1

true,bromf,hartnell,Hartnell,"I propose a new radical theory.  We know Rassalon wanted to make the timelords become beings of conciousness alone.  Say this allows them to break the timelock, then on the other side they go and find the tech to reassemble into bodies, but it fails giving them the bodies of the silence.  They find the Master's old TARDIS from classic who, but time has caused disrepair in his absance.  This is the machine in the loger episode, it retains the ability to travel in space and uses hashed time travel mechanics stolen from Darleks or the wristband River uses.  They use this to, over years, make it to Earth as it is a known haunt of the Doctor's.  By enginering situations they can get the doctor to reactivate it for thier use, allowing them to reform their bodies by traveling to the correct time/place.  To stay underwraps they use timelord physic powers to blot themselves from peoples memories, these are retained from having timelord concesness.  &lt;The doctor did it to Donor, but he sucks balls at it, compared to other timelords, like say the master, who was infamous for his skill&gt;.

The astronaut is the master, he disapeared in the christmas specail, he also has been known to survie hidious deformation &lt;See The Deadly Assassin, Tom Baker Years&gt;.  So he uses the spacesuit to hide this.  Getting him to the right year is the problem, he is not the little girl astronaut from '69, but is immatating her in 2011, one year on from his duel with Rassalon.  His motives are against the timelords for what they did to him, and so sides with the doctor to prevent this, with a plan to capture his half baked TARDIS and reactivate it.

Amy is not pregnant, deal with it.  River is not a child in the suit in '69, when she first meets the doctor she is taken to the singing mountains, and the doctor would not take a child on the TARDIS for adventures, the TARDIS is a strick 18+ ride, for the most part.

How does the doctor get around dieing?  Clone maybe, but I like the idea that he just rewrites time, and they use the old ""Paradox's are easy because I am the Doctor"" thereby avoiding reprocutions.

If the referendum passes, AV will be used to vote for individual MPs. Which party controls parliament will still be determined by who has the most MPs. And because of AV, the composition of MPs in parliament will likely change.

Because first-past-the-post tends to encourage strategic voting, in our current system, most MPs tend to be either Labour or Tory, even if voters really prefer other candidates. With AV, voters will vote more often for ""fringe"" parties such as the BNP, Lib dems and Green, cause they don't have to worry about preventing either Labour or the Conversatives from assuming power.

true,alexgmcm,eng-sussex,Sussex,"&gt;i agree that it's not appropriate to protest at someone's wedding.

People can protest whatever they like - it's a peaceful protest not Black Bloc Anarchists storming the Church with molotovs.

If the Government starts deciding that certain things aren't appropriate for protesting then it's a slippery slope. After all protesting the G20 would be unwelcoming to our foreign guests and put Britain in a bad light, possibly damaging British trade - maybe we should ban protesting that too?

Until eventually it isn't seen as 'appropriate' to protest anything supported by the State and the right to protest is dead.

Given that the Royal Wedding is an icon of their grand lifestyle which is funded by the British people (both directly through paying for the security etc. and indirectly by allowing them the ill-gotten lands and wealth of their ancestors) I see no reason why protests shouldn't be allowed.

1) The Time War changed everything, possibly even undoing any and all prior rules of time travel.  I've heard reference to a ""Web of Time"" which may have been slowly unraveling since the Time Lords were removed from the continuum.  
2) It was Ten who began to realize that he could change the timeline, but that there were consequences for doing it selfishly or with arrogance.  Eleven has finally begun to figure out how to make use of these new rules, and he does it by *having a plan* and following through.  This turns the paradoxes into self-consistent, stable closed loops.  
3) Big Bang 2 potentially changed everything *again*.  Considering that the Doctor has been an integral part of the beginning and the end of the universe (and almost everything in between), it might just be that *Time itself* now has to bend to *his* rules and not the other way around.  He is a complex temporal event now, the thread that holds the tapestry of space-time together.  
  
It's also an updating of our own understanding of the functioning of the universe and all its quirks.

My thought is that they were in Amy's house, and used the crack to bring her some of this memory power, and drew the TARDIS to her specifically (they can make it blow up and speak from inside it, they could make it land somewhere, especially when he wasn't really steering), and that they ""erased"" the universe knowing that the doctor would reboot it.

As for why, considering the inability to remember them, it seems like they're still not completely back in the universe, so maybe they were completely removed from it before, but not killed. May also still need the doctor for another related stunt. My first thought is the time lords of course, since he's the one who banned them, they've already tried to get back, and the silents are obviously building/growing a TARDIS.

It happens to be the one in The Stolen Earth that [exterminates the Doctor](/spoiler). That was like three years ago. Is that still a spoiler? Whatever. Anyway, when Jack thinks he blows it up, he actually doesn't kill the Dalek inside. It teleports away, finding itself trapped inside the Progenitor. It is freed when the Doctor activates the machine inadvertently, and goes on to become the Dalek that chases everyone around in The Big Bang. 

When the day is saved at the end, it didn't actually die. It finds itself tumbling through time and falls through the time lock around the Time War. He lands on Gallifrey, but he's destroyed and in some kind of weird experiment, some of its cells are injected into a female Time Lord host. These cells miraculously divide and become an embryo, which is then born and becomes the Doctor. He goes on his adventures for hundreds of years.

At some point in the distant future, let's say the Doctor's 13th life, he does battle with an enemy (for the sake of argument, Elizabeth Taylor). Presumably Liz Taylor whacks him over the head with a skillet, and he loses all memory. He crash lands in Amy's hometown in 1985 (With Liz Taylor stealing the TARDIS), adopts the normal-sounding name Rory Williams, and manages to put himself through medical school, getting his job at Royal Leadworth Hospital in 1990. No one pays him any mind until he meets Amy Pond. The two of them get together and the rest is history...

...Until Rory [dies](/spoiler) in Cold Blood. When he [falls out of the universe](/spoiler), his consciousness remembers that he's actually the Doctor, but there's nothing he can do. He drifts around aimlessly until the cracks finally end up closing. His consciousness, rushing to enter the universe again, gets its aim a bit wrong and enters the embryonic Amy Pond. Being a baby, the Dalek/Doctor/Rory consciousness loses all memory again and grows up thinking she's totally normal Amy Pond. 

At some point in the near future, Amy's body is going to be badly damaged (not [killed instantly](/spoiler) like in The Big Bang), and all that Time Lord conscious energy is going to come to the forefront again. She's going to regenerate, turning into River Song and regaining ALL of her memories. She decides, ""What the hey? I was pretty outstanding in my past life as the Doctor"" and starts flirting with him incessantly.

Kakuta has added some spark to Fulham at times, at least in his limited appearances. I think he will be ready to start next season but theres no guarantee on that.

The story is experienced through the lens of a character who has no background knowledge of the Doctor at all, so throughout the episode the audience discovers the bare basics of the show's premise along with her: The Doctor is a time traveler and his time machine is a blue box. Simple! 

Personally I think the 2005 series is the best place to start, but if a friend wants to jump right in without logging hours of back story, Blink does save you a bit of the time and energy of all that explanation. I've started a few friends off there, and most of them decided then and there to backtrack and watch everything from the beginning anyway.

Then you've got Jamie's Italian and Carluccio's. Go out? Well, just avoid West St unless you're a chav.

I certainly romanticize the notion of a star athlete doing something for the good of the team and club.

But I've certainly become jaded over the years.

Nowadays it's certainly a matter of business over loyalty. Owners are looking to get theirs. Players are looking to get theirs.

It's like the line in The Godfather: It's not personal, it's business.

As a fan, I've just grown to support the name on the front of the jersey rather than the back.

If a player wants to leave (ahem.Torres.ahem)? Then fine, get out of here. If a player wants to *pretend* to leave to get a bigger contract? Well, that's what you gotta do in this day and age.

It's right on the seafront (opposite the King Alfred Leisure Centre), and it's about a 15-20 minute walk into Brighton town centre, or a 5 minute bus ride (you can catch the shitty seafront buses that are wildly unpredictable as to whether they turn up or not, or you can walk up to New Church Road and get the 1, 1A, or 6 buses straight into town. The walk is nice though - go down to the beach and walk along the promenade, it'll take you all the way past Hove Lawns, the burnt out husk of the West Pier, all the way to the Brighton/Palace Pier - that's when you've hit the town centre.

Enjoy the city. I've since moved to Shanghai but I'm one of those rare breeds of Brightonians who was born and bred there (well, Hove actually), and I do find myself missing my hometown.

I recommend the Laines/North Laines for shopping, walking through the Pavilion Gardens while you're there, Hove Lawns and the promenade, etc. Brighton is a tourist hotspot and the main attractions (the Pier, West Street, etc.) are generally fucking horrendous.

If you want to spend time on the beach, I recommend walking down towards Hove rather than doing what everybody else does and crowding around beaches near Brighton Pier. Down by Hove it's much quieter, cleaner and generally more pleasant.

As for pubs and the like, there's a great pub on Western Road on the cusp of Brighton and Hove (near Palmeira Square) called The Bee's Mouth. They've got a whole bunch of speciality and imported beers, Asahi on tap, and the pub goes 3 floors underground. Very friendly, laid back place in general, but the drinks are a little expensive.

There's The Brunswick which is also nearby, which is another nice pub. If you find yourself in Kemp Town, the Thomas Kemp is a great little pub with very friendly staff and a nice garden. And if you want a Sunday roast, get thee to The Barley Mow on St Georges Road in Kemp Town (just down the road from Brighton College). They do a very good Sunday roast, but get there earlyish to get a spot in the garden outside and before the roast potatoes start to go soggy.

It is theoretically possible that the big event happens at the *end* of this season, rather than the start. If nothing else, the trailer for the season did hint that at least one other critter is hunting our favourite Doctor.

I want to point out I know virtually nothing about Blink 182, and I chose to look them up solely because they had *Blink* in their name.  Gathering all of this took maybe 2 minutes on wikipedia.  If I *really* did a search, I could easily find a dozen more connections, and likely much stronger ones, too.  I could probably come across just as many connections linking Doctor Who to Wu Tang Clan, or Frank Sinatra, or Mozart.  When you look for connections, it's *very* easy to find them.

I sometimes come off as overly aggressive when I argue a point, but I'm almost never genuinely upset.  Sorry if you thought otherwise, or took it personally.

We all love hunting for clues, and the intricate nature with which Moffat constructs his plots.  I just want people to be aware of how easy it is to see things that aren't there before they jump to conclusions.

true,glitterforbrains,null,null,"I agree: Joy (the child in the astronaut suit) is the Doctor and Amy's child, somehow left in limbo in the 60's by some event involving the Silents, who want her either to (unsuccessfully) fly a (pseudo) TARDIS, or dead. For some reason the Silents want to kill Joy, which is why the secretary in the White House bathroom, a woman named Joy, is murdered. It wasn't ""joy"" the emotion, but ""Joy"" or a future Joy they wanted dead. They most likely want her dead because they mistakenly believe her to be the person in the spacesuit, and the one who took the Doctor from them. They want to change the timestream.

Perhaps the Silence cannot get to Joy and/or River in an astronaut suit, in much the same manner that the Vashta Narada have difficulty seeping through a hardened spacesuit. Perhaps the Silence needs sound, making the Moon an ideal place for Joy to chill out for awhile (a few years). A name check to the ""Doctor Moon"", who is fond of saying ""and then ... you forgot"".

But the Impossible Astronaut is River. Whether or not River is Joy is unlikely. Seeing as how the Silents are after the Doctor and won't stop until he's dead, at some point in the future when River is trustworthy, he reveals some key info to her, such as a secret word (which is in Silence in the Library), and how to fly the TARDIS.

Enabling the TARDIS's cloaking will play a key plot point in the future, ie to hide it from the Silence.

We will see cutbacks to other episodes where the Silence is definitely present, but no one notices them, much like the Doctor passing through his own timeline at the end of The Big Bang.

Your characters must be in peril, or it's not compelling drama.

It doesn't always have to be death.  

One of my favorite moments is from The Beast Below - where the doctor is about to make the whale brain dead.  

His quote: ""One, I let the Star Whale continue, in unendurable agony for hundreds more years; Two, I kill everyone on this ship; Three, I murder a beautiful, innocent creature as painlessly as I can. *And then, I... I find a new name, because I won't be The Doctor anymore*. ""  

It's a powerful line - and Amy 'saves him', saves the hero, who is in danger of becoming damaged.  That's Drama.

How do you create drama with a character who **always lives, always escapes?**

Moffatt knows *exactly* what he's doing. Instead of the doctor being in control, we're constantly left off kilter, keeping us on the edge of our seats.  ""How long is the doctor going to live? Oh, he has 13 lives?  We're on #11?  Kill him.""  Now the audience is aghast.  ""How dare you! How can you...?""

Since this is a crime and not a civil matter (unless there was an agreement to borrow money), you need to get the police involved. However, before that, tell her to ring her bank/building society and tell them she lost her card; it'll get cancelled and a new one issued.

Also, unless he's been charging stuff to her card, there's no way he can simply take money out of her account through debit card details. Also, if it was a credit card, you'd be able to chargeback almost all the payments as they are unauthorised - with debit cards, it's a lot harder, but it'd be worth talking to your bank/building society about it. Always maintain that the payments were *never* authorised.

However, since I know not the precise details of what happened, I cannot tell you what crime(s) he's committed, if any. However, if I were to guess, it would be fraud, as he would have to pose as the cardholder (your girlfriend) in order to have payments charged to the card. Gather as much evidence as possible before pursuing action. Try to get him to incriminate himself on record, approach him about it whilst recording the conversation.

Understand however that once the police have enough reasonable suspicion to believe her brother has in fact committed fraud, action *will* be taken, so be sure the police is the route you want to go down *before* contacting them. As an aside, personally, I hate getting involved in the family affairs of girlfriends, they're just a massive headache and you really should be thinking whether you want to be with somebody who is so silly with their finances. Honestly, it's pretty ridiculous that it's been left this long.

I find Moffat's writing and Matt Smith's Doctor probably the worst yet of the 2005 ""reboot"".  Sure I enjoyed ""Don't Blink"" and all, but I simply cannot relate to Smith as well as I could to Eccleston or Tennant.

Allow me to expand on this.  When I watched Tennant and Eccleston I felt I ""knew"" the doctor, in the sense that I could predict what he'd so, or feel, and I felt a connection with him.  I felt the connection they had to Rose, it was palpable.  However when I watch the fifth season it feels like I'm just watching a corny sci-fi show and I don't feel invested at all.

I can't be alone on this, can I?  It might be Matt Smith, it might be Steven Moffat or maybe it's me.  However I'm just not feeling the doctor this time around, he seems very two dimensional and I have a hard time caring what he's doing.

Having said that, I am  still watching the show and have hopes that it will improve.  Or maybe the show is just going to a place where I want to get off.  Thoughts?

2. I don't want to see Gerrard play anything close to a defensive role. I remember reading analysis of him in a defensive role and it was just plain awful.

3. Agger and Carragher will never be our main 2 center backs next season. Agger is too often injured and Carragher is getting too old.

In my opinion we need a good center back. I'm sure we will see someone like Simon KjÃ¦r or Hangeland. Wilson and Kelly will also be knocking on the door. We need left winger defiantly, he doesn't have to be as offensive as Ronaldo/Messi, Suarez will fill this role if we ever play 4-3-3/4-5-1. Lastly we'll need a left back and/or cultured midfielder like Adam. 

We have plenty of young players stepping up now: Robinson, Kelly and Flanagan, not to mention Wilson. It's risky, but they deserve the left/right back positions. As well as Johnson was at his best in left back. Our midfield is strong with: Gerrard, Meireles and Lucas/Spearing (who have had their best season ever). These are positions that need strengthening, but can do with out them. So it just depends on who and on what prize we will get on the left wing and in the center back, if we get a left back and/or central mid

true,weblypistol,cnty-uk,Llanfairpwllgwyngyll.... etc.,"That's just opinion not fact. I can put forward thought through opinions that have force too.

Imagine a no win. Politicians and media may exclaim that people have rejected reform. However it may be that people recognise this is no real change and are not convinced. This does not undermine a desire for PR, real change. Nor does it mean a lost chance. Wales rejected an Assembly in 1979 but voted for it in 1997. Similarly, Scotland although very narrowly voted for a parliament, they were defeated on threshold levels due to low turnout, yet again achieved a parliament in 1997. Also referendums are rare, so as far as generational stuff, don't expect another one in 5 years.

Say there is a yes win. It will take a number of election cycles to see how things work. The electorate may well look at results and say, well that changed bugger all. Not only can politicians turn around and say well we did electoral reform and it is settled ( are you still waiting for another in or out EU referendum? - that's not going to happen ), the populace may have lost appetite for electoral reform having seen the results of the miserable compromise that failed to deliver anything it promised. It could make matters worse. Never mind a generation, electoral reform is off the cards till your grandchildren get mildly excited.

What if there is a low turnout? Well, a result either way suggests the referendum has been a complete waste of time with little legitimacy on the choice offered. It also has to be said that it is true that no AV system has progressed to PR. It may turn out not to be a stepping stone but a cul-de-sac.

So I don't accept that if AV is rejected or ignored that this is a missed chance for years stretching into the future. It's one of those little phrases trotted out with no academic basis behind it. Merely opinion or someone else's version of 'common sense'.

Meanwhile there are some very real political things happening that really affect people's liberty, but let's not be distracted by those, concentrate on the important things. I fully expect a referendum on whether Walkers crisps should change their colour scheme for cheese and onion/salt and vinegar at this rate.

Their voting system for electing the party leader wasn't the same as AV. It was a series of elections with the least popular candidate dropping out in each round. In each election voters had one vote to exercise (no list of preferences).

The Conservatives may want FPTP for party-political advantage, but then so do the pro-AV campaigners. Both sides also have principled arguments on why their system is better for voters, and in the Tories case I believe they do genuinely think it is of benefit to the people if we have a system in which all votes carry the same weight. Many disagree with the argument, but there's no reason to doubt their sincerity more than anyone else's.

On your last point, the men we have to thank for only having AV on offer are Gordon Brown, who concocted it as a last-ditch attempt to get Clegg into a Lib-Lab coalition, and Nick Clegg for not extracting a broader referendum from the Tories as the price of doing business.

If your point is that that these referendum are rare, square that with the Wales/Scotland example. More apt square that with the EU example as I outlined.

If I am right, it is not going to be 5 years. I explained that.

As to the status quo Vs. something a bit fairer? I reject that altogether. AV will not change anything looking at academic analysis of past elections, could make matters worse according to Roy Jenkins the high priest of PR, and poison the well for future moves as I outlined. Both no to AV and yes to AV have peddled out such a load of claptrap I'm staggered so much goes unchallenged. The echo chamber here on reddit is frankly embarrassing.

A) Watch a 9th Doctor episode. I personally recommend Dalek as it is the first episode to emerge from the awkward (imho) first few episodes of season 27 (series 1) and is a great standalone ep, but it will sort of drop you into the Whoniverse lacking some context, so maybe watch Rose (his first episode and first episode of the 2005 series).
 
B) If you liked what you saw, watch the rest of that season and the next, etc., or if you're now itching to catch up and watch the current season, there's really no way around watching season 32 (series 5), but before you do maybe you should hit the highlights of Ten first: Girl in the Fireplace, Silence in the Library,  Midnight.

C) In all this if you decide to take an interest in seasons prior to the revival (It's not a reboot. A reboot restarts a show from scratch. Doctor Who is continued (albeit it does NOT pick up just after it left off)), get your feet wet by watching some 4th Doctor. I recommend Pyramids of Mars (featuring the recently late and wonderful Lis Sladen as Sarah Jane)

With the exception of the classic series recommendations, as all classic stories are multiparts, I have recommended single episodes in case you decide DW isn't your bag and you want to bail but you're one of those people who have to at least watch the whole episode.

You thought the scene in Pandorica where all the aliens are flying around and he hops up on the tallest thing he can to dance around like a pissed off teenager talking about how tough he is was.... brilliant?

Look, honestly, I'll cut him some slack since he didn't write that crap scene; or the paradox filled shit that was him already being out of the pandorica being required to get himself out of the pandorica... but really - that was crap.

Likewise, when he walked through the hologram in Prisoner 0 to declare himself the most recent doctor.. at best he managed smug.  Which, again, isn't remotely intimidating.

So yes, think what you will but I have to disagree.  I think those scenes were crap.. In one case it was because the written story was crap and needed great acting to save it and that salvation didn't arive.  In the other case, it was a great scene that was let down.

I say again, however, I'm not saying I don't think he's a good doctor, just that I haven't seen him manage the same level of beleavability about how powerfull he is yet.  He does lots of things well, but Tennant could make me feel like I should be scared of him.  When Smith tries that, though, he has only ever managed to make me think I might should hit him before he tries to do something clever.

true,weblypistol,cnty-uk,Llanfairpwllgwyngyll.... etc.,"There are sources saying all sorts of stuff all over the place. Many far better and weighty than this. Why I should regard this blog as the authoritative spout of all wisdom I'm not sure. Perhaps I should base my decision on some spurious case involving beer and coffee as told by someone with a history degree talking about electoral changes prior to 1950? The author even admits bias, but then other sources may have bias too and you have to work through that. I have seen this before mind and don't accept the stance having looked around. Nor does it answer the once in a generation claim or the consequences of a vote for the future.

No one has given me a convincing argument to vote one way or the other, yet alone vote. Someone did ask for me to vote yes with them in mind even though I think it is a pointless exercise ( I have other votes anyway, so what difference would it make to use up some time doing so ), I was nearly convinced, then some rude person returned me to the matter as an academic exercise in considering consequences and the irrelevance of it all.

I will add a rider that in the Welsh assembly, a further referendum extending powers occurred after 14 years and was successful, but that is still within the 3 to 4 election cycle and passed because the assembly has been successful. AV on the other hand will not in anyway bring real change looking at the studies, so extending electoral change on the basis of this is hardly a useful comparator. AV will not increase the voice of minority votes, third choices are mad maths, second choices unlikely to make a difference, it will not end tactical voting, will not make MPs work harder, will not end financial scandals, will not mean the best MP ( just blander promises *cough Clegg* of MPs who will do what they will anyway - Blair was all things to all people -  or worse those more willing to tow the party line) just the least offensive to some, will not be an avenue for extremists, will not mean a guaranteed 50% acceptability, if there are any changes ( and at best that will be few ) watch boundary change/constituency size/number of MPs wipe that out, will not end safe seats ( the marginals will still be the key ). It will not be more expensive or complex, just pointless. There will not be more coalitions or cooperation. Nor will there be a change for calls for change if AV is rejected/ignored. You may just end up voting for a new establishment extending way into the future as I have outlined. Maybe this really is a once in a generation chance to say something.

Meanwhile the government ( of we know who ) is screwing the countries ordinary, poor , vulnerable and sick royally. Is the distraction not enough? We had better have a 'special' wedding hijacked just in case people notice. Too cynical? Well a certain bully did use it as an excuse to have a go at 'elf and safety recently. Nice dog whistle to the Mail/Express crowd. Plus if the economy is dead on it's knees, a day off is not a good idea considering the snow excuses before. Cuts have not kicked in and stagflation looks a real possibility. Perhaps 'our' coalition should lock this in as a five year plan for voting. And you can forget HOL reform in all reality. But that is a different matter.

Human Nature/Family of Blood on the other hand is a nice dose of drama that you don't need to be a whovian to get and fills in the background of what the doctor is like.

Another good one if (like me) you prefer humor to drama, is the first episode of Season 6 (also the first with the 11th doctor, and a new companion so it's almost like a reboot), The Eleventh Hour. It has the doctor acting wonderfully kooky, and is one of the recommended start points for someone watching the series for the first time.

Ok so my solution to ending excessive immigration is to locate the reasons people want to come here, mostly our economic dominance and checkbook colonialism which has made our pound worth so much more than their home currency - we should then work to untangle the copyright restrictions, supply order issues and educational training facilities which limit the ability of people in other nations to enjoy their home country as much as they enjoy cleaning the floors of England.  If our government were to switch to creating open source solutions to it's own needs these could be utilized and modified by other states to facilitate modernization thus negating the need of impoverished people to seek menial employment in england.  problem solved, however no one will ever mention this until the far worse and much more economically destructive policies of the deluded right demand it.  
  
of course sensible people are simply ignoring politics and making the revolution happen on it's own - the reprap will one day reform cottage industry, gnu-linux based platforms will give everyone the power once only the richest could enjoy, openfarm will make permiculture feasible for everyone, wikipedia and all the open university projects will a make knowledge finally universal!

Don't be an idiot. Reactionary behaviour is the intended response of the NO campaign. ""A vote for YES will mean this child will die of AIDS"" is nothing more that fear-monging a vote out of somebody who believes this.

There are arguments for it, and arguments against it, but what it really comes down to for most people is ""will it result in more votes for my party"" rather than will it be better for the country. Thus Tory's are against it and LD and Lab are for it as that's the most likely result that would occur.

Either way I vote, I will still get lied too by whoever is in charge so it matters little to me which way it goes. 

TBH, I don't think we should even be having a referendum on the matter anyway, just as I never thought we should have one on the Euro and EU. Billy Bob McRacist who knows absolutely nothing about anything but hates foreigners shouldn't be allowed to vote on a matter of importance to the whole country, but he is allowed to vote however he likes, as am I.

PS. Surely this type of vote would be a result of an AV campaign? I'll vote Labour, but who should I pick 2nd, or 3rd or 4th? Since I am voting for who I want in, my 2nd and 3rd votes will be based on absolutely anything I can think of. It will be ""which party do I dislike the least"" and a party's campaigns will be at the forefront of my mind.

Which is true.  But if your going to do that, then you need to do it right because, all things considered, the Doctor being filp and still being the Doctor is actually harder to do right than the last two.  Which is why I actually have high hopes for Smith. It takes time to get into the character and really find it.  

So I kinda take all of that first season and just think of it as a practice run.  In that context, I am expecting things to really heat up going forwards, (and if I can catch up in episodes I hear some of the more recent ones are great).

The stories produced for Moffat's S5 aren't all winners, but several of them are VERY good...just like I would describe every one of RTD's seasons.

But every time a Doctor came along that I didn't like so much, and every time a story arc came along that I just couldn't buy much into, I've just waited it out.  Here's the thing about Doctor Who: like the weather, it changes.  If you don't like what's going on right now, just hang tight; sooner or later something will come along that you DO like.  No need to go 'round saying ""man, I'm gonna quit watching this show all together!""  Because Series 6 might not float your boat, but maybe Series 7 will.  Or Series 8.

And whenever something comes along you REALLY dig, you'll be glad you stuck through the ""not-so-much"" stuff.  Oh, and I guarantee you that something in those ""later on"" stories that you end up liking will share some continuity with the stories going on now that you feel aren't the greatest.

I've no experience of an AV system in use, therefore I will have no idea what the final result would be. Will it be better, or fairer, or result is more voter apathy in UK is practically guess work. I know exactly how the systems both work, but how either vote would benefit me as an individual isn't something that the system can tell you. That's down to the opposing sides rather than the systems themselves.

&gt;This is not entirely correct, the party it will harm most is Labour which is why they're currently splitting in two over this issue. The Tories will lose a little and the Lib-dems will gain.

Labour gain in that it's a major victory against the opposition, and they could argue that had the previous election been AV, then the likeliness  of a Labour win or Labour/Lib Dem coalition would have been much higher based on that a Lib Dem voter would place Labour above Conservative.

Whether it is better or not will come down to the results and we won't know that for another 3 years.

&gt;Well apparently you aren't very interested in knowing much about anything either

Not true in the slightest. I know both systems and always did (it's not that difficult), but since both systems are flawed in equal amounts and no party originally wanted AV, it's clear that this referendum is nothing more than the Torys pandering to the Lib Dems to make them feel as though this is a Coalition, rather than a Tory run government with Lib Dem cheerleaders.

I place little value on this referendum and have little opinion on whether we should or shouldn't change, but as a democracy, I will use my vote. And since I don't like the Tory approach, I'll go against them.

EDIT: Check out[ the polls.](http://ukpollingreport.co.uk/av-referendum) FPTP currently has a decent lead, but what is noticeable is the number of ""don't know"" votes. In the Polls which allow it, that's 25% of the people polled. This kinda backs up my point that whether AV passes or fails, many people just can't see if it really benefits them or not.

true,ScreamingGerman,null,null,"&gt; The main question we are facing is whether Torres and Drogba can play together in a 4-3-3.

They can't, nor do I think they should. Of all the players listed in your post, those are the only true CFs so they should only be played there. Plus, Drogba-Torres, or Torres-Drogba, assuming both are in-form, is a killer one-two punch. With Drogba's age, he may not mind a super-sub role, especially if it means he keeps scoring goals. 

A 4-3-3 requires a very strong centre forward because he needs to be the focal point of the offense, which is why we look much better with Drogba (and sometimes Torres) in form, they distract the centre backs and help setup the wingers or afford them more space. It was great seeing a strong CF for 90 minutes again, be it Drogba or Torres. A strong rotation is essential for success both domestic and European.

I don't think Torres AND Drogba can start together, both players are being misplayed if they're forced out wide. The best option for the club is to rotate the two of them at the CF position. The only way they can play together is in a 4-4-2, but I find we're best with having a holding midfielder (MIKEL!) so the 4-3-3 is preferred (I think the diamond is way too narrow, or if isn't, with Cole/Ivanovic constantly pushing up, then it's too weak defensively).

I agree that Anelka's done is more or less done; Sturridge is ready now, and looks to be everything that Anelka was in his prime - pace, a good touch and an eye for goal. It's a natural succession, but we have to thank Anelka for his time here as he's been very good for us on the pitch, and a good professional for us as well. Very easy player to work with, in contract to his earlier career. I will miss him if he indeed leaves.

I disagree with starting Torres on the left, he's not a wide player, and essentially we'll be playing two strikers and maybe a wide right player in Sturridge. I think some of our best play is when we can stretch the play out wide, and for that Malouda/Zhirkov is still the best options currently. I don't think Aguero is a wide player (preferring to play in the middle I believe) and I harbor doubts that Neymar can succeed in the English league due to the physicality of it.

Maybe it's worth the risk to see if Aguero can be a left-sided player, he's the one I'd peg to have the most success with Chelsea. My starting line-up would be:

&gt; Aguero/Malouda/Zhirkov ------- Drogba/Torres ------- Sturridge/Kalou

Look forward to your midfield post, although I don't think our defense needs that much discussion. Keep Terry, Alex and Ivanovic at CB, with Bruma possible as cover for them, Cole at LB with Zhirkov and either Bertrand or van Aanholt providing cover, and buy one new right back. Keep Ferreira as he is a good squad player and remains a dependable defensive option. Might be the time to sell Mancienne as he doesn't seem to be able to even be a fringe player for us.",0,1304001357,null,0,false,0,c1re6gu,t3_gxdbv,t1_c1re6gu,t3_gxdbv,1427101048,2,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,2

It's as if some people would just be happy being given a bulleted list of clever plot points instead of an actual show with actors and a story. Same thing which happened with Lost, many fans lost sight of the actual story in front of their eyes to focus too much on the background mythology. 

I think with Who its a combination of feeling like certain reveals must be more clever on their own as information, minus HOW it is revealed or factors into the story line, and an obsession with the show's mythology which Gaiman and Moffat have been trying to tell fans to lighten up on and gain perspective. Hell, that'd probably be a good way to put it, a lack of perspective on the part of some fans. 

It's one thing to just whimsically speculate as it can be quite fun, but at the end of the day all that matters is what is put to screen. It doesn't matter how clever or complex a theory may be if it can't be tied into the narrative or have any resonance on the characters.

First you have Â£9k a year tuition:
Â£9k x 4 = Â£36k
Then ~Â£5k per year living costs (this is probably optimistic):
Â£5k x 4 = Â£20k

So the total debt is about Â£56k.

My teacher in sixth form only just paid her student loan off when she was 30 and she went when the fees were only just starting to be brought in. A Â£56k debt is insane and the repayments are only really small if you use the Government's cases where you are earning a pittance and inflation is really low. 

But with inflation at ~4% atm and no-one really knows what it could be like in the years over which you repay the loan, the interest could actually be worse than the Government like to make out (although much better than a high street loan) and the repayments can actually take a fair dent out of a reasonable pay packet.

I'm not saying that the current unemployment is due to the coming fees. I am saying that we shouldn't be making it more difficult to get an education when we have such a problem with unemployment because it will prevent the unemployed from training for new sectors where they could find a job.

Education is the most important thing to pay for because it gives people new opportunities. It isn't much better if people stay living hopeless lives on the dole but we give them an extra Â£10 a week to live on and pretend it makes it okay. It is much better to offer them a route out so that they can support themselves and that doesn't come from telling them to pull themselves up by their bootstraps or get on their bike but by offering them a chance to get trained and educated.",0,1304011068,null,0,false,0,c1rf4kj,t3_gz7n3,t1_c1rf4kj,t1_c1rf1tm,1427101496,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt;First off, if that were the case there would be no need to compare the diaries to see where they were. 

Sure there is.  The doctor does things between meetings with River.  It could be 50 years for him but a week for her.  So lets say Jim the Fish happens at age 950/30.  So she meets him at age 900/30 and a week

River: seen Jim the Fish?
Doctor: Nope.

They meet at age 910/30 and 2 weeks
River: Jim the Fish? 
Doctor: No.

She just needs to know how far along in *her* journal, *he* is to avoid spoilers since she can't just ask his age since you trust the Doctor to tell the truth about his age (Rule 1).

&gt;Also, in The Impossible Astronaut, River sees the ~1100 Doctor before the ~900 Doctor

I don't think the ~1100 counts as one of their meetings.  he's tracing back to interfere in his own timeline which should be completely against the rules.  Same with screwdriver thing.  I think that when he meets her for her first time he'll go to right before the library and give her the screwdriver.  She always meets him in reverse order but he can do what he wants because his time travel is better and he can spend decades looking for her in a general time/space while she can only go to places she knows he'll be, which, for her, are places she's already been so can't revisit since she's human and doesn't have decades to waste trying to break the 'natural' order of their time travel.

She says in Impossible Astronaut ""every time I see him I know him a little more and he knows me a little less"".

&gt;She also seems surprised in Silence in the Library that the Doctor is younger than she has ever seen him. 

She's surprised he's THAT young I believe, but I interpreted it less as surprise than shock.  She realizes it's the first time he's met her (and therefore probably the last she'll meet him) and doesn't want to accept it.

Even if there were any political appetite for it, no one would dare raise it as the media would present it as re-asking the question in a different way because politicians didn't get the answer they wanted. The only thing I could think of that would bring reform back on the agenda soon would be a massive constitution crisis or scandal, if the mass hatred of MPs after the expenses scandal only really got us this far I can't begin to imagine what that would be.

This is only the second referendum in British history so it really is a unique opportunity to have a say, and the sad thing is most people won't bother.

I have this theory of fictional time travel that usually resolves closed loop paradoxes. It goes something like, you can start with Timeline A and you can set off a series of events that ends up in a stable toggle between Timeline B and C or maybe it sets off a chain of timelines that doesn't stablize until Timelines PP and QQ, but either way you can sort of imagine that there was a progression there. 

The problem with the Pandorica paradox is that you had the Doctor locked in a perfect box and he had no options, so there wasn't a progression of timelines that led to a stable loop of him getting out. He just... got out. 

That to me signaled that this writer was going to just flat out break the time rules. When push comes to shove, the Doctor just... won't die. That's all there is to it. 

I just ended up watching Time and Space specials again last night, and it was basically just another paradox that Moffat had kicking around in his head that he couldn't find a full episode to use it on.

I like to think that River is Amy but River being Amy's daughter is a popular theory(not so popular of a theory is that River kills Amy.)  River will most likely teach Amy how to pilot the TARDIS at some point and either she'll teach a younger River or that's how she knows it, because they are one in the same.

2.  I think the Astronaut is whoever was consumed by the suit after they save the girl.  After all, it is considered a family show and family shows don't usually kill kids from Earth.  I don't think it's River or any of the core cast because River knows how the Doctor dies and she didn't remember him getting blasted in Utah.

3.  The Silents are trying to turn Earth into a giant spaceship to fight a war with a hereto unmentioned race.  Although controversial, they seem to reflect the agents of a mock Zionist conspiracy.  Think about it:

a) they operate in secret
b) they are firmly established
c) they secretly control the government
d) their purpose is to use other nations to fight their war, what they fight is far worse than they are but they can still be considered ""evil"".

&gt; Here's the situation:
&gt; 
&gt; * TomTom, when you first set your GPS up, asks you if you want anonymous time/location travel data to be
&gt; sent to TomTom. You can say no if you want. This has been going on for years.
&gt; 
&gt; *   TomTom sends this anonymous data to authorities and governments with the idea that it will help them 
&gt; know where to build new/better roads etc. This has been going on for years.
&gt;   
&gt; *    TomTom finds out that Dutch police are using this data to set up speed traps. TomTom, as a courtesy, lets 
&gt; everyone know what the Dutch police are doing, while they decide what to do about it.
&gt; 
&gt; And somehow the headline we get paints TomTom as evil jerks for this? They are the ones who let you know 
&gt; about what Dutch police are doing. This is a press release that they issued. They are warning you.

In one comic, ""The Heart of a Star"" from his collection *Endless Nights* [galaxies and stars meet as people near the beginning of creation to discuss the rules of the universe.](/spoiler)  It feels, oddly, like a Doctor Who episode.  If they had an infinite amount of money for special effects.

Labour and the Lib Dems are also vastly at odds on some key policy issues (obviously not as much as the Tories and Lib Dems but they haven't merged, they are a coalition government).

If they were to do so I think it would lose them collectively quite a few votes and breakaway parties would probably be created and we'd end up back in the same situation all over again.

We are simply not a 2 party nation any more, no matter what the Tories claim nor what senior Labour MPs claim.

I can't remember the exact figures but in the 60s nearly 100% of voters  voted for the Tories or Labour, at the last election it was in the 65% area, that is obviously still the majority but it is clear that the nation is no longer divided down 1 line.

Quite frankly I think the Lib Dem voters who are angry with Clegg for going into a coalition with the Tories simply did not listen last time, he always said he would attempt to form a government with the party which has the popular vote, which the Tories did, there is no argument about that. To throw away this opportunity over that is ""cutting off your nose to spite your face"" as the saying goes. I disagree with some of the things that have been done, but I can see where the Lib Dems have tempers some Tory policies and have gotten some of their policies implemented (obviously I am not defending things like students fees, they will get a bloody nose over that and rightly so, but a national referendum is not the place to do that, that would be the election)",0,1304031389,null,0,false,0,c1rh8ct,t3_gzexe,t1_c1rh8ct,t1_c1rgsjs,1427102552,16,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,16

true,sailfastliveslow,present,null,"Maybe it was my naivety in assuming that the with the modern game, forwards have become more versatile with skills that suit playing both in the middle and out wide.  If we use a true holding midfielder (Mikel), and have true attacking wing backs to provide the width (we would need a better option than Ivanovic), I don't think we would have a width issue playing strikers out wide (a-la Barca's 4-3-3).  In this sense I think Drogba (especially as of late) and Torres could rotate wide.

To quote Ancelotti:
&gt;""Maybe they can sacrifice something of their ability, of their skills, but they can play together. If you are able to do this, I think it is good for the team, to get good results.""

Basically, though Torres or Drogba are best in the center, an on form Torres or Drogba out wide would be be better than almost everyone else on the team in that position.  They might not play/produce to their best, but the team will be better.  Over the summer they could get used to the versatility and make the roles their own.

Oh and if you're truly worried about Neymar's physicality, his frame is much more similar to a C. Ronaldo or a Nani than a Robinho or such, and with some age and proper strength training I think he could very easily cope with the physicality of the English game. Plus, he is perfect to play on the left of a 4-3-3 (more so than Aguero, who I think is more suited for the hole in a 4-4-1-1).  I do think with Aguero's pace he could adapt to play out wide, with my only questions being in his service into the box.

Because you like her that much that, the fear of rejection would cripple your spirit. Then the cat guy comes along.. he goes straight in there for the kill just like you know you should have. The next day you hear he fucked her. You lose interest and realize her pureness has been tainted by the vicious predator that is.. the cat guy.

Dog guy would just be behind you supporting you to get in there. Saying 'SHRIMP LAD, YOU SHOULD JUST ASK HER BACK TO YOURS FOR DRINKS KID, GET IN THERE AND STOP BEING A FAGGOT', and make you question your manliness (or fellow dogliness). 

The only thing that makes this tale sweeter is that the dog could obviously rip the head off the cat. The problem is, is that the cat has sharp claws (maybe the catguy might get drunk, and use a broken bottle against you).. but in an all out fight, the dog would still prevale.

Of the top 100 best paid players in the sport:

* Chelsea claims 8

* Spurs: Zero.

We all know what's happened here. Spurs have done wonders with a squad of quite good players, but, ultimately, it's a money game, more $$$ buys more squad depth, and our total revenues are less than a third of Manchester United's, and half of Arsenals.

While the Champions League run was glorious, and Spurs were 'punching above their weight', and we all know it. 

Things are changing at WHL, however, revenues are up (49% over last year), Spurs are getting a following outside of North London, and they're able to make hires they wouldn't have been able to pull off 10 years ago (VdV, Modric, and Pav being fine examples).

Most crucial, however, if we are to seek silverware, is steady growth of income, good hires, and brilliant coaching.

Maybe the free market will sort this out. I can't imagine most polytechnic universities being able to sustain these price levels for long; but what for the people who are caught in between? It's hardly fair.

true,ScreamingGerman,null,null,"I'm sure both Drogba and Torres could adapt to playing out wide, but they've spent their whole career playing as centre forwards, it's where their biggest strengths are, and I think if Ancelotti can properly rotate them to keep their morale up, we would never be weak up front. Opposing defenders having to go 90 minutes against an energetic, world-class striker would be devastating. Coupled with a pair of wingers/wide players it would be a really potent offense. While I'm sure both Drogba/Torres can play wide, I'm sure there's some nuances to playing wing that they wouldn't pick up on simply because of a lack of experience and perhaps skill set. I don't think Drogba and Torres are known for pace, more so for acceleration. Wide players like Ronaldo, Lennon, Walcott etc., are very fast and are up against players with very good endurance. It seems more of a mis-match to me to put them up against each other. Drogba is a pretty good crosser but I'm not sure about Torres, so service could be suspect. Until I see either of them doing well in a wide position (Drogba sometimes drifts wide and does well enough, I really don't think Torres can do it though), I'd prefer both in at CF and rotating, while we bring in legitimate wide threats. 

By the way, I didn't say the 4-3-3 was too narrow, but the diamond 4-1-2-1-2. Essentially having 4 central midfielders leaves us too bare on the sides. If the fullbacks do push up then we're exposed to counter-attacks. A team like Spurs would rip us apart. 

Ronaldo's pretty jacked. Is Nani really that big? He looks dainty, or maybe that's because of all the diving. What really worries me is that he's 50/50 at best - he could be a Robinho or he could be a Ronaldo. There's no telling so it's a huge gamble and a very large sum of money for his signature, so huge expectations and pressure. The expected potential is hard to overlook, hard not to get excited about but there's a huge risk involved in a direct transfer from Brazil. Had he a season or two in Portugal or Italy, I would feel much more comfortable about bringing him in.

Spot on about Aguero, he's definitely used to operating as either a centre forward or trequartista. Probably could adapt to playing wide better than either Drogba or Torres because of his improved pace, but his crossing skills could be suspect.",0,1304050210,null,0,false,0,c1rivhk,t3_gxdbv,t1_c1rivhk,t1_c1rhclf,1427103327,1,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,1

true,ScreamingGerman,null,null,"I think Zhirkov and Malouda slotted into midfield simply because we needed someone creative to fill Lampard and Benayoun's absence, so I don't consider either CMs but rather SMFs, so our CMs are:

&gt; Lampard, Essien, Mikel, Ramires, Benayoun, McEachran, and Clifford

I hope McEachran gets the Sturridge treatment for his personal development and the club's feature. If McEachran is not yet ready though, then neither is Clifford in my opinion, so our options are further reduced to:

&gt; Lampard, Essien, Mikel, Ramires, Benayoun

These are actually pretty strong. I think we should stop trying to make Essien or Ramires play as the holding midfielder though, and maybe bring in someone with experience for that position. I wish we kept Ballack for that spot, as he can also play in all three midfield positions we usually have. Anyways, Mikel should get the nod for it more often as he's becoming more dependable with more experience, and looks like a solid fit in the most defensive midfield position. I think Essien should be considered his backup though if no one new comes in, as he does have experience there back when it was Lampard, Ballack and Essien in the midfield.

Obviously Essien and Ramires should rotate in the ""midfield engine"" position, both look very good at it and can really push our team forward. Ramires needs time to continue to adapt to the game and Essien needs a decent backup to stay fit over the whole season, so I think they compliment each other well.

Lampard and Benayoun are the two creative midfielders in our arsenal and I look forward to seeing Benayoun get more playing time in the coming games. Lampard should regain his more next season if he maintains his fitness and we maintain the 4-3-3. Benayoun would be nice alternatve because Lamps is getting older and rest is never that bad for the fitness of older players.

So, I agree our best options for midfield are

true,sailfastliveslow,present,null,"I agree, Drogba has shown more as far as playing wide than Torres, and if they both played in a 4-3-3, I think Torres could end up being in the middle for that reason.

And I didn't say a 4-3-3 was too narrow either, but when playing out and out strikers such as Drogba or Torres wide, it would be very nice to have Cole or another attacking back on the right to help provide width and service into the box.  This would let Torres and Drogba drift to the middle when we are pressing.  Thats why I emphasized the importance of the holding midfielder helping out to cover for the fullbacks.

I agree, rotating the center forwards for freshness would be nice, but it could be hard to keep them on form or confident that way.  Most forwards like to play the full 90.

And on the diving comment, I totally agree.  He goes down at the hint of contact and I hate that part of his game.

And as for Neymar, I think he is a far better prospect than Robinho (the last Brazilian forward that was hyped this much) ever was.  Both started their careers at Santos, Neymar breaking into the first team a year younger.  He is also bigger and taller than Robinho.

If you just look at the statistics, Neymar has also been more prolific than Robinho was in his first years at Santos.  In Robinho's first 3 full seasons at Santos he scored 10 in 30, 13 in 46, and 25 in 45.  In his last season before Madrid bought him he had 12 goals in 21 games.  To compare, Neymar's statistics so far are 14 in 49, 43 in 63, and 6 in 14 so far in this early season.  Robinho debuted for the national team when he was 18, but didn't score for them until he was 21.  Neymar also debuted for the national team when he was 18, but already has 3 goals in 3 games for them.

Now I know goalscoring records aren't the only/best measure of a player's ability, but I just really think he is the real deal, and the closest to a can't miss prospect in the world today.

Donna and Meta-Crisis have the Time Lord knowledge (the culture and/or religious aspect of Judaism)

Jenny has the physiology (nation and/or ethnicity)

The Doctor (all of them)

So Jenny is a Time Lord in physiology; however, the Doctor said, ""You're an echo, that's all. A Time Lord is so much more. A sum of knowledge, a code, shared history, shared suffering."" So as you said, if she were to gain that aspect then she could be considered a true Time Lord.

This idea only works if there is no distinction between a Time Lord and a Gallifreyan. I looked up [Gallifreyan](http://tardis.wikia.com/wiki/Gallifreyan). If we assume that Gallifreyan is the species and Time Lords is a society then Jenny merely becomes a clone with Gallifreyan DNA. It is only if consider Time Lords a species (seperate from Gallifreyan or otherwise) that you would have to make distinction like my idea. That link does not give a clear answer to which would be the case.

Just looking at the episode though, the Doctor never considered her a Time Lord. Though that might have changed if she would have started traveling with him",0,1304055712,null,0,false,0,c1rjb1q,t3_gzhy9,t1_c1rjb1q,t1_c1rhebb,1427103530,1,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,1

* Stop having such a huge presence.  So small many demonstrations around London attract more police officers than protesters.  That's absurd.

* Kettleing has got to stop.  It is a clear violation of human rights, and is being used in increasingly transparent attempts to discourage dissent and protest rather than for any legitimate public order purpose.  Using police cordons to direct protesters along a particular route our away from certain locations is legitimate, but trapping them for hours should result in every single officer involved being charged with false arrest/imprisonment.

* Arrest specifically and only those actually committing violent acts.  Most protest organizers and participants do not want violence, and if the police were not acting like it was their job to stop the protest they would likely find that the crowd would be quite supportive of targeted arrests of trouble-makers.

On a practical level: if officers operated as if they were participants in the protest (and I don't mean as undercover agents provocateur) rather than as a kind of military presence they would likely find out much easier to achieve the aim of keeping protests peaceful.  Of course, this would require that peaceful protest be accepted as a legitimate part of a free society, which is something this country seems to have a problem with (c.f.

true,HarryBlessKnapp,eng-GreaterLondon,South Weezey Mandem,"I've seen research into the psychology of crowds that suggests a strong police presence is more likely to cause trouble as the crowd feels  that it is being persecuted. An inconspicuous police force can be a much better way of dealing with crowds. This approach has been implemented at football matches, and it seems to have improved crowd behaviour.

I'm massively all for free speech but there are times where it's more sensible to pick a more appropriate time. It's likely if they did go ahead with their protest they would have recieved a lot of grief from the well-wishers that were down there, thus in turn would have 'disturbed the peace'. The police also had a massive duty to ensure the safety of the Royal Family today so any opposition could be viewed as a potential serious threat. They don't know for sure the groups that may set on running at the Royal carriage.

And on another note, I wouldn't particularly like my wedding day to be troubled by protesters. Just because they are the Royal family doesn't mean that they could just ignore people causing a scene on their big day, and there is every chance an anti-royal protest could become large enough for them to notice (and protests can also defer away from their main point and get quite personal).

Not really.  The problem is that the wedding itself is expensive and conceivably expensive at that.  People look at it, can compare it with their own weddings and know that it cost a fair bit of money.  But compared with most amounts of money you deal with on a national level e.g. size of the NHS, size of the government, size of the deficit, size of the economy, benefit to the economy of the royal wedding, the cost of the wedding itself is so small as to not even register as being relevant.  It would not be a sensible fiscal strategy to not have the royal wedding to save money; it's just too small to be rationally objected to, you can only sensibly object to it as symbolically not something we should be spending money on.  

That said however, as a whole it may well have been the most expensive wedding in history, but the real expense of the wedding was not the WWII fly past, or the policing, or cleaning up the litter... it was the day off [ with a cost to the economy of Â£3bn-Â£5bn,](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/royal-wedding/8155625/Royal-wedding-marriage-will-cost-economy-5bn.html) which dwarfs any other cost by many many times, yet  funnily enough, doesn't seem to be the thrust of people's objections.",0,1304093574,null,0,false,0,c1rlbxa,t3_h056d,t1_c1rlbxa,t1_c1rkwd2,1427104485,6,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,6

true,BlueGinger,tardis,TARDIS,"Working my way up to three. About a year ago, I decided I wanted to get into Dr. Who (because knowing me, I knew I would fall in love with it) and as it was summer, I had a lot of free tv time to fill. I told two of my Anglophile friends they should check it out too (they're also even sci-fi fans too, so that worked in my favor) and we could all discuss Who together. This was enough for one, and she and I watched the entire new series together, meeting after work when our schedules paired up. We complained about Martha with each other, put up with her bf (and one of my best friends) complaining about *us*, and spoke in quotes that no one else found amusing. My other friend (a huge sci-fi nerd AND anglophile) unfortunately had moved away and it was harder to prod him into it (He's only now starting with 9, 3 eps in, and I keep telling him he'll get hooked if he just keeps faith). I'll win him over, I'll just need a little time, our tastes in tv are too matched for him not to like it.

And finally with the hype that had been building for series 6, my other friend was pursuaded to start following 11 so we watched series 5 together before this past weekend. And with the help of the beautiful ginger Amy, we got her hooked too. I will be making her go back and see all the other episodes from 9 and 10 as well, but I think it was Amy that really tipped things in favor.

true,CptFlwrs,eng-middlesex,Middlesex,"That still doesn't answer the lack of sensible thought that seems to have gone into arranging these protests. My argument is not for rights being taken away so to speak, but moreso that the people behind these protests should have been more careful. Disturbing the peace is a crime, if they are found to be conspiring to disturb the peace, then the police are perfectly within their jurisdiction to arrest. 

The police defend the interest of the working people everyday. The recent highly publicized events cannot be the be all and end all of the work the police force does. We all know the media pick and choose what they broadcast and enjoy sensationalising. I learnt in History that you can't make a completely rounded statement about a situation through one snapshot, because there are many things outside of the frame that you can't see.

They tolerate peaceful protest and people speaking their mind against things they deem wrong, but there can be a point where things look like they may turn for the worse. That is when it is seen as getting ugly.

With reference to the protesters being more guilty, I'd refer loosely to ""the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few"". There were to be many more supporters of the wedding to be down there, so in a harsh reality the few protesters would have been (in the police's eyes particularly) potentially disrupting the safety of the general public present at the celebrations.

In a situation like this I think the police's duty to protect the Head of State is paramount regardless of political stance. At the end of the day they are still considered an important part of British society and are at a high risk level, especially with opposition nearby. A crazy protester running at the Queen is not wanted to be seen by the state and probably not by the majority of the British public. Yes if a member of the public were to die as a result of the wedding it would be deeply saddening, but bottom line is people would be far more concerned if the Queen, William, Kate etc had come to harm.

Yes funded by tax payers, we all know. That still doesn't draw from my point that they are real people.

""The Doctor's Wife"" was written by Neil Gaiman, and in a recent interview he mentioned that it was supposed to be episode 11 of the first series, but that it was pushed due to budget reasons (hence The Lodger, much cheaper to produce than a typical Who script, and adapted from an earlier comic starring the Tenth Doctor).  

Anyways, Neil Gaiman specifically mentions that Rory wasn't in his original script (consider the timeframe of S1/E11; makes sense), and was only added when the episode was pushed back. BUT he does mention that he was very happy to write Rory into the script.

It would seem like an awful lot of rewriting to make those two the focus. Besides, Neil Gaiman's got bigger ideas in his head than those two.

It's similar to that guy who used to run out in front of marathon runners, technically he was doing nothing wrong with his protests, but the police tried to stopped him anyway, because it was in bad taste in general.

Sometimes protests are stopped when they are going to fuck with a big public event, I personally think it's not a bad thing. 

It should be written into law though, actually worded and voted upon. Rather than left to police officers to make it up as they go along. That's the bit I don't like, in terms of service they're probably doing a good job, but they're acting above their stations.

It's the way they have to go about it and the fact that the bad-taste theatre performers were in their rights.

The crowd was launching bottles and shouting, etc. It really was out of order of the crowd to act like that, and with how fast the police responded they were clearly nearby on standby.
