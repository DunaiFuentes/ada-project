There are many bad points to the UK and those you hear about in the news constantly so I won't cover those.

I used to live in a idlic place called Tansley village since birth to the age of 12, it had a primary school, pre school, village hall, village green, post office and despite its side three pubs.  

I loved the place with its woods round the back and you knew everyone and everyone who you met in the streets would say hello or how is your day and where parents could tell their 8 year old kid to go to the shops for a pint of milk in the winter when it darkens early at 7pm, no crime and a lovely place to live.

If I stilled lived there I would probably become a philosopher as even young I would wake up early, run down to the bottom of the orchard trees in spring and watch the sunlight raise over the woods, reflecting through the orchard trees where newly spun spider webs would glisten with morning dew.  Surrounded by natures beauty and the silence of a new dawn with just the birds singing in the background.  For as long as I live and wherever I have been since I have yet to feel as truly at peace as i felt back then.


The pubs, oh god the traditional pubs where you can go in alone and come out having met the most interesting locals.  Every traditional pub I have been in all runs by the same rules, everyone is courteous, interesting and always at least one member of the old guard usually people refer to him as ""The Colonel"" and when time is closed the locals will stay for a lock-in.

IMO the fact that the Doctor has had two instances where he could have completely wiped out the Daleks and could not bring himself to wipe out an entire race no matter how evil is really what defines the character.

Personally, I really liked ""The Key to Time"" series. Watching ""The Five Doctors"" is kind of a hoot too.

I think the key to the magic of the old Doctor Who episodes is that at the time, late 60's and on into the 70's and 80's, there really wasn't anything like it on TV or in the movies.

destination wedding is out.  Once you enter England on your Visa, you will be unable to leave for 2 years, and your wedding will have to take place in England.

So I load my pipe and smoke a nice big bowl before finishing David Tennet.
Oh. My. God. 

Waters of Mars was great...showed a crazy, wild eyed Doctor who had finally gone a bit too far only to be shot back to the ground. Then the End of Time part I...to be honest I wasn't a huge fan of the story. The crazy Master was fun but I wished there had been more, but then part II... 

I was fine up until the Master sacrificed himself and the Doctor thought he had cheated death. Then those four...fucking...knocks...
From then on I cried till the very end. Never has any media sent me on such an emotional roller coaster, from crying to laughing to bawling in a span of 30 minutes. And THEN just when I thought it was over he comes out with ""I don't want to go"" and I lose it only to be laughing at Matt Smith's performance.

If you come over on a fiancee visa you will be permitted one entry to the country, you must marry within 6 months of arriving or return to your country of residence. The fiancee visa does not permit you to work in the UK or receive any kind of benefit from the government.

I'm afraid that you're going to cancel the wedding in Jamaica, you have to marry in the UK and must be married by an official registrar. 

You wont be able to apply for citizenship right away. Your first option is to apply for temporary residence, which gives you two years in the UK and permits you to work. After the first two years, you will be offered to either extend for a further two years or apply for permanent residency. Once you have been in the country for 4 years (I believe, could be wrong) you can apply for citizenship which will give you the right to a British passport.

One man, who has no criminal record, was stopped more than 25 times in less than three years after a ""protest"" marker was placed against his car after he attended a small protest against duck and pheasant shooting. 

&gt;* Police surveillance units, known as Forward Intelligence Teams (FIT) and Evidence Gatherers, record footage and take photographs of campaigners as they enter and leave openly advertised public meetings. These images are entered on force-wide databases so that police can chronicle the campaigners' political activities. The information is added to the central NPOIU.

The IRA was always a threat hanging over the process, but after 9/11 the americans stopped funding it, also they realised that having people killed was uncool and put pressure on the IRA to go away and to the political parties to stop messing about and to actually commit to an agreement.

So I think 9/11 probably sped up the process by a couple of years and probably left the republican side with less concessions than they otherwise would have been given.  Probably have had a united Ireland by now, instead they've helped generate bitterness and division.. I mean, your not going to be great mates with people who shot and killed friends and family of yours are you?  30 years of that kinda stuff gets ingrained in peoples' culture and belief system that will take another 30 years or more to get rid of.. had they not been getting m-16's and lots of money to buy explosives, I think they'd have still been able to make the same political progress just without as much bitterness from the british people.

He does have a large amount of assists comparatively, but I believe that most of those came in the 5 goal Berba game, which I'll agree skews stats.  This is kind of my point about Berba.  He goes on goal rampages.  He has 5 goals in the one game against Blackburn or whoever, but he also has a hattrick (against Liverpool) and a brace (against Sunderland) in separate games this year in the EPL.  And I think he has at least one hattrick in another competition.  Given Spurs form we are going to  attempt to make this into a shoot-out.  If anybody on United can keep up with that it's Berba.  Rooney and Chicharito could easily each get a goal, (even if Chicharito only plays for 10 minutes).  But I think Spurs could win 3-2.  Berba would probably either get 0 or eleventeen, and if he got 0 and only Rooney plays Nani's got to have some goals.

I can't really explain exactly what this thing is that I see more of in american women and am yet to really see in the British.

In The Doctor's (and our) future, they'll meet for River's first time, something will happen in their relationship that causes him to tell her his real name, something that she also apologises for in the Finale (""Everything changes"") and he'll make, and give her a sonic screwdriver with the ""red setting"" and the ability to store her consciousness (he knows it will need these settings because he's already seen it happen, like in the Time Crash special)

I think during Angels she knows his name, and has the sonic.  She may just not have it with her due to the fact that she's under military escort from prison.  This is why she gets the Doctor to ""Sonic me"".

During Angles she implies she knows quite a few ""spoilers"".  I take this to mean that whatever causes her to apologise, learn the Doctor's name, fly the TARDIS, and get his Sonic, has all already happened.  I just see those things as being linked.  If they're dealt with as separate events, it's entirely possible that some will happen, then The Doctor will travel to a point in her life *after* Angels, and give her the Sonic.

The exact order of the in-between bits isn't that important.  What's important is the fact that the first time The Doctor met River is River's last.  This allows The Doctor to forgive her for whatever she feels the need to apologize for in the finale.  (At the end of the finale, when she apologizes and says ""everything changes"" she doesn't know that The Doctor already holds her in high regard, knowing she'll sacrifice herself to save thousands in The Library).

* Only sign a six-month contract initially, or a 12-month contract with a 6 month break clause.

* Make sure it has modern central heating, preferably a combi-boiler

* View at least three properties, possibly up to 10. If you haven't found something you like by 10, you may not be realistic.

* Don't just go through agents, gumtree can be much better. You save on agents fees (about £200) and your landlord saves on letting fees (about 10% of the monthly rent), so you get better properties for your money.

* Make sure your deposit is protected appropriately, read the direct.gov page for more information on this. You should receive information on how the deposit is protected within one month. If you don't ask your landlord; I believe the penalty for not protecting it is about 3x the deposit, you may need to remind them this.

* Take pictures of any damage when you move in, have your landlord sign them if possible.

* Don't worry too much, you're only renting a property and even if it sucks, you can be out in six months",0,1295218418,null,0,false,0,c1d07n8,t3_f3g11,t1_c1d07n8,t3_f3g11,1426698426,6,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,6

true,brainburger,cnty-uk,London,"Ok it is reasonable to conclude that supernatural aid is possible in the extreme. It is not reasonable to believe it is any more than extremely unlikely. In short, its reasonable to proceed on the basis that it does not exist.  

I need more than a molecule of doubt to seriously doubt.
The absence of evidence, where there should be evidence, *is* evidence of absence.  

Consider the holy site, Lourdes. This is the greatest place for magical healing on Earth. 200 Million people have attended and asked for supernatural aid. There have been 67 'miracles'. All were cures of ailments which sometimes get better spontaneously. Not one was a healed amputee, though there seems no reason why amputees are disdained and refused aid by God.  
The remarkable thing here is that more false-positives haven't been documented. Now, it is most certain that a drug-trial with results like that would conclude that the drug does not work. That would be reasonable, and the drug would not be licensed as effective.  

Stop the daft hunt for absolute truth. There is no God giving supernatural aid. If you agree, you are an atheist, whether you like the label or not.

Has a path/road big enough to drive down to under the house and park the car in the garage.  Then theres one garden on one layer, then a set of steps down to the patio then theres a rolling hill that drops off onto another garden, then theres a vegitable patch after that and then a massive row of trees and the orchard is after that.  Then theres a wall I used to hop over and was in the woods.

I wish I still lived there (not just because it was lovely, but the price has risen in 11 by £200K) but the garden was wonderful, three gardens, a orchard and vegetable patch at about 600 to 800 meters sq.  If you ever wanted to define British countryside then Tansley would be the first place you would go to, and thats it no where else would live up to idlic place that hardly anyones ever heard about.  

Close the Matlock Bath where my family and I would go and play on the amusements, Abraham heights with the cable cars, down the road theres a wonderful river and waterfall that you would walk to just because it was untouched by any sort of modern day intrusions.

Oh god, the Church as well, the wonderful Church that I went to as a kid and got baptised when I wanted to, after every Sunday service I would put out the candles and count the money with the Rev and play with his son while the Adults would have Tea.  Some weekend nights my mother and her friends would congregate on the Village green and while we were playing ball or on the swingers they would break out the red wine.  At New Year as well everyone (well I was much younger and though it was the entire village) would get together in one families house (it was massive and brilliant) and the kids would play in the kid room while the adults got hammered and counted down the new year.  They had a pond outside and lived next to the woods as well so we'd play there as well.  
Thats the sort of place it was, you could let a party of 15 kids aged between 7 to 14 go and run wild in the garden and woods (never went far, it was always dark so stayed within the spotlights).

I think back to my Childhood and think I am going to be a terrible parent as my children will never experience the wonders and brilliant time I had as a Child, they will never know a time where they can wander the streets alone, they will never know that village feeling of familiarity and probably never live in as perfect a place as Tansley is.",0,1295224718,null,0,true,0,c1d0m2g,t3_f29l4,t1_c1d0m2g,t1_c1ct1zv,1426698612,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

true,smellycoat,null,null,"Ever since deposit protection was introduced, renting in the UK is far more straightforward. Back in the day it was almost guaranteed that you'd lose a proportion of your deposit unless you took some rather extreme measures, but that's not the case these days.

Your first stop should be the university's accommodation website (most of them have one) which will likely give you a list of agencies and landlords to contact first. The fact they're listed on the university's site means they're unlikely to be too shady, and you have some extra leverage if things go bad.

When you're out looking at places, check the basic stuff. You don't need to be too diligent (it's only temporary, after all), but it's easy to overlook something that might cause you significant trouble later. Make sure the heating system exists and looks reasonably modern (switch it on, if you can). Check the shower, you'll be surprised how many student flats skimp on a decent shower. Make sure the windows and doors look relatively secure, and check for any significant draughts. Don't forget to have a look around outside, check out the neighbours, etc.

Pick somewhere you can definitely afford. Bear in mind you'll need to find a deposit up front (typically 1-2 month's rent). Don't live somewhere you can *only just* afford, make sure there's some headroom.

Once you've found a place, read the contract before signing it (make sure everything in there seems reasonable), and don't be afraid to ask questions or ask for things to be changed (make sure you get any agreements in writing).

They should give you an inventory (a description of the state of the property and fixtures). Check it thoroughly. If anything doesn't match up (eg if something's broken and the inventory doesn't say so), raise it with the agent. If you have any concerns, take photos (timestamp them). When you move out, the inventory will be the only thing between you and getting your deposit back. If anything listed on the inventory is significantly more worn, dirty or damaged than the inventory describes, you're likely to lose a proportion of your deposit, so check it carefully. They like to get you on stuff like stains on carpets/walls/furniture, the cleanliness of the oven, etc.

But, renting is generally pretty easy, if you stick to university accredited landlords and don't treat the place like shit, you'll be fine.",0,1295231868,null,0,false,0,c1d11ua,t3_f3g11,t1_c1d11ua,t3_f3g11,1426698817,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

We visited Matlock Bath a few times as well, going up the cable cars was always great fun, and (while a younger kid at least) visiting Gulliver's Kingdom was a fantastic treat. I was always a fan of the mining museum there as well when younger, if only for the tunnels you could crawl through &amp; explore! I don't actually remember anything about the exhibits themselves, just those tunnels!

The post office and village green I'll always remember as well, walking down to the post office with my grandma to pick up some things (I'll never remember what, most likely bread and pensions!), and getting a little bag of sweets from the jars behind the counter, then stopping off at the playground on the green to play with my brothers. We usually visited during our summer holidays, when the English kids were still in school, so it was always deserted during the day.

The church is beautiful, though I haven't been in there too much. My grandma used to take when I was a lot younger (single digits), and the one thing that sticks out is getting shown the organ there at one point, though unfortunately back then I was too young to fully appreciate it! I also got christened there, when I was seven (at the insistence of my grandparents most likely - my parents and myself are agnostic/athiest), and more recently was there for the funeral of my great-grandmother.

&gt;""The Daily Show is the total focus of Jon Stewart's life and he's the editor-in-chief - it's not a presenting gig he fits in between being a DJ or appearing on panel and clip shows.

&gt;The Daily Show is a news show with a satirical agenda - and properly resourced. Like all American shows, it's a writer-driven show, and 99% of all UK attempts at satirical, topical comedy, 10 O'Clock Live will fail because it doesn't have the right kind of writers, or enough of them - and Channel 4 isn't prepared to pay the kind of money that would support the recruitment, training and remuneration that delivers the kind of intelligent, informed witing that satire requires. Formulaic insult jokes that pass for good writing on UK panel shows won't be enough to make 10OCL fly.

&gt;At an executive level Channel 4 doesn't have the necessary journalistic expertise, courage or intelligent comedy judgement to support a show that might actually have some satrical impact (otherwise it would still be backing people like Mark Thomas and Chris Morris). All the presenters have other individual careers to protect, and will all run for the hills after the first few inevitably disappointing weeks - at least they'll be able to blame each other...""

People in the UK have been getting drunk at the weekends since weekends and alcohol were invented... it isnt something new..  thats the first point to make.

Secondly, if you have more than a few drinks its considered a binge, most people consider the term 'binge' to mean drinking until you cannot stand up or are in a pretty bad state, when infact, If I drank a bottle of wine in an evening, its considered binging... Doesnt matter if I drink it with food, water, etc, over the space of a long meal.. still binging.

The idea is actually to try and control people and to stop them drinking more than a single glass.

That said, there is a culture which has developed faster with increasing wealth amongst young people where they get really drunk, really leery, violent, disrespectful to themselves and others... the sort of thing you see on TV talking about 'britains drinking culture'.

The problem, is like someone else has said, the people.  If they lived in France, Germany, italy or anywhere else, these people would be just as bad.  but they don't.

What needs to happen? What will I teach my children?  A glass of wine is to be enjoyed for its flavour, beer the same.  Why Drink, something to do while being social with friends, not an end in itself.

I think the culture has lost its way somewhat, the whole purpose of the culture appears to be 'to drink' rather than to drink while enjoying a discussion, music, gaming, food, where a drink could easily be substituted for Tea/Coffee or simply Water.

Okay, i'm simplifying it a bit, there is the social lubricant aspect, helping ugly people have sex since 1500..etc.  

Being Northern Irish, I get a slightly different culture where I am, the Irish have a more European perspective on it, going to the pub on an night out is more social, but of course its not totally european and binge drinking is a major issue.. 

I believe the drink companies have a lot to answer for, beer you can buy cheap, carling, fosters, carlsberg, stuff with next to no flavour, goes down like water and are considered 'session beers' are far too cheap, it almost appears to encourage people to drink for the sake of it, rather than savouring the taste, after all these beers have next to no flavour..    I am also a craft brewer, I brew for my own and my friends consumption, lots of real ale etc and beers that you could not sit down on a night and drink 10 pints of, but the flavour is to be savoured and it isnt a race to see who needs their stomach pumped sooner..  My point being that there is more profit to be made in cheap nasty beer that can be sold for £2.50 a pint in a pub where you will drink 10 pints, than if you buy 3 pints of £3 beer...

true,SendInTheNinjas,null,null,"My boyfriend and I have been renting for about a year and a half now and we've had some, er, interesting times, the last of which being nearly evicted because our landlord decided not to pay his mortgage. Anyway:

* Apply for 'single adult discount' on council tax if your gf is a student.

* Set a strict maximum for how much rent you can pay based on your income and stick to it. It's no good saying 'oh but I liked house X and it's only £50 more per month' because that will come back and bite you in the ass one day. 

* Your biggest expense by far will be utilities like electric, because they are stupidly over-priced. There is very little you can do as a tenant to 'modify' your home to make it more energy efficient, so make sure to ask about heating/insulation etc when you view the places. 

* When you view, go round the walls and look for damp. Put your hand on the wall underneath windows in particular and if it feels damp (not cold, damp) this is a massive red flag and you should back away not making eye contact. Also, open all the cupboards and check their hinges aren't about to fall off etc. Check the state of the plumbing, tiles etc in the bathroom. This may seem obvious but the agent will want to shoo you round quick so they can go to another appointment - take your time and make sure you absolutely know what you're getting.

* Haggle on the rent. If the place has been on the market longer, the landlord will be more willing to negotiate. 

* Once you're in, take out contents insurance, and treat the house nicely. Take photos of all the rooms when you move in so the landlord can't pull a 'look at the damage' when you move out. 

* Know your rights, especially about things like maintenance work, which people have a habit of trying to weed out of. Don't take any guff from landlord/agency and if something bad happens, keep pushing until you reach a solution where you're served best.

true,mickey_kneecaps,null,null,"Actually, in the USA at least, Eco-terrorists are by far the most active terrorists, responsible for the great majority of all attacks. While few are injured in their attacks, their prime targets are scientists and laboratories, including at research universities, and they do target people and their families, not just property. In my city (Seattle), they burned down the botany laboratory at the University of Washington, under the mistaken belief that the scientists there were genetically modifying plants (even if this were true, it is legitimate scientific research and targeting it should be abhorred). Many research institutions are forced to take money from already tight research budgets to allocate to personal security for prominent researchers, who are the targets of hundreds of threats and attacks annually. Attacks have included car bombs, and masked gangs banging on windows and doors of peoples homes at night with bats (often with the families of the researchers inside). Many academic researchers have been forced to abandon promising scientific research in fear of the safety of their families. 

The activities of these groups within the USA are tracked by the Southern Poverty Law Center, a non-profit operation dedicated to tracking and exposing hate-groups of all persuasions (most in the USA are right-wing, but the eco-terrorists are lefties). Here is a page they keep with a small selection of attacks from the last 25 years: 
[http://www.splcenter.org/get-informed/intelligence-report/browse-all-issues/2002/fall/from-push-to-shove/eco-violence-the-rec](http://www.splcenter.org/get-informed/intelligence-report/browse-all-issues/2002/fall/from-push-to-shove/eco-violence-the-rec)

The primary antagonists in these attacks (on the environmental, rather than the animal-rights, side) is the ELF (Earth Liberation Front). The ELF was actually founded in Brighton, UK, and work closely with the ALF (Animal Liberation Front), which Monbiot admits has been responsible for ""plenty of violence."" This info is from the ELFs Wikipedia page: [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth_Liberation_Front](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth_Liberation_Front), which gives as a source a book written by an American scholar close to the movement.

Groups like these are every bit as dangerous as white-nationalists, Muslim extremists, anti-government conspiracy groups, and other extremists, and deserve to be closely monitored to prevent them from committing violent and destructive acts. 

Edit: Added link to Wiki page.

I agree with Monbiot (and hopefully most other commentators) that the tactics used by the government to spy on these groups have been highly authoritarian and anti-democratic, but to claim that they are not dangerous is ludicrous.

Binge drinking (as you've defined it) does happen in the UK, but it's just as prevalent in France, at least in Brittany. I really haven't noticed a difference at all, except that since pub prices are relatively higher in France than the UK, most evenings out in France tended to start with a few bottles of vodka at home before heading out to the bars.

&gt; or on the fact that the food in UK is awful...

This is most definitely not a ""fact"". It's a prejudice. There is certainly good food in France and bad food in the UK, but the reverse is true as well.

It seems to be ingrained into French people to shit on English food because of tradition or something, and make up ludicrous tales of what we eat. Almost everyone had a story ""when I was in England on exchange, my family gave me a raw onion and jam for dinner!"" ""Oh yeah? Well _my_ family gave me raw cabbage and mint sauce!"", etc.

One longstanding gripe is ""you eat _jam_ with food!"". Well, no. _Cranberry jelly_ is a traditional thing to have with turkey, and it is nothing like jam at all, certainly not sweet and sickly.

""Meat and fruit just doesn't mix - you English are disgusting"". \*cough\* _Canard à l'orange_. \*cough\* _Côte de porc avec compote de pommes_. ""Mais non, c'est différent ça"". Mon cul, oui.

Also, for a country so smug about their own cuisine, I've known surprisingly few French people who could actually cook. As in, in a group of 10-15 people in their early twenties, half couldn't tell cumin from a knock-knock joke, fewer knew that paprika wasn't inherently hot, and only one knew that curry powder wasn't a pure spice but actually a mix.

But I suppose that's ""cuisine étrangère"". Everyone knows that French food is the best in the world, so why learn anything else? Well, on a poll on the same people, only half could tell me the ingredients to a _béchamel_ sauce, and only two had the faintest idea of how to make it. This is something that my (English!) parents taught me before I was 12.

I'm all for this type of measure. Does anyone know if the whopping increase in cigarette pricing has had a recorded effect on the number of smokers? I know that it has affected me. I stopped buying cigarettes as much, now they cost so much, and that has helped break the habit somewhat so I crave them less, so I want to buy them less etc; and now I pretty much only smoke socially and very infrequently. Anyway, if there is a link, and I suspect there is, I would imagine a similar alcohol related policy would have similar effects.

true,citizenfaith,scottish,"Edinburgh raised, Glasgow residing","Civil partnership is not legally the same as marriage - if it was it would be called 'marriage'. Now obviously you could say that this is just a technicality and it's marriage by another name and that may be true, but this wasn't solely a religious distinction, there is a legal distinction there too. This, of course, invites the question of why is there any legal distinction at all? Why shouldn't two men be able to get actually legally *married*? Why do we need one legal union for different sex couples and another for same sex couples? It would have been much easier to simply take out the provision in the legislation which requires a couple to be opposite sex in order to get married than it was to legislate for, and invent, this whole new creature 'civil partnership', so why was it done? 

The answer (I think) is that it was done to appease religious types just like the owners of this hotel so that they didn't feel the so-called 'sanctity' of the institution had been damaged. The owners of the hotel tried to use a loophole in the law to allow them to discriminate and they were rightly called on it, but that loophole should never have existed in the first place.

So the irony here is that whilst the owners of the hotel say they are being discriminated against because their religion supposedly requires them to treat marriage and civil partnership the same, the real discrimination is that civil partnership even exists.

Long Answer:

It's possible that's all been undone by the Series 5 finale, like you said. It's also possible, and really quite more likely considering that it was never formally addressed, that her missing memories have something to do with The Silence and the coming events of Series 6. It's certainly been foreshadowed, and I believe outright stated by Steven Moffat, that there's a lot more to Amy than we know, so her memory issues could be something altogether new.

As for why Kazran can touch himself (giggity), this is one of those continuity things that you really need to learn to completely disregard if you want to properly enjoy Doctor Who, since the show really doesn't let continuity get in the way of the story. 

In Father's Day, the Rose situation you mentioned, it's explained that crazy shit happened because there were two sets of the Ninth Doctor and Rose there, coupled with the fact that Rose altered history in a bad way, which essentially ripped spacetime wide open. Because of this, the paradox that's created when Rose touches herself (giggity) is amplified. Basically, she poked a larger hole in an already weak spot in the universe.

true,janoo1989,tom-baker,Tom Baker,"My theory for Kazran being ok for touching his younger self is that it's his storyline. Rose on the other hand not only wrongfully saved her dad but also crossed her own storyline. There were 3 copies of Rose (including the baby) in that world and she just kept knowingly messing around with the timelines (I think the timeline crossing is what caused all the bad things to happen, not saving her dad). That's the way I worked it out in my head. If anything, you could link it to The Doctor having this right due to his being a timelord. Wibbley Wobbly, Timey Wimey. 

As for the Daleks coming back, it's not clear if they're from Davros/Supreme or from the Emperor (Parting of the Ways). Either way, the absolute genocidal act by the HalfHuman-Doctor or BadWolf-Rose seems to have failed to destroy that one ship. If anything, BadWolf-Rose failed to revive Jack Harkness properly too so pobady's nerfect. 

It does seem like they retconned some stuff (GIANT CYBERKING IN VICTORIAN LONDON!!!!) and it initially bothered me. I was sort of worried that in future episodes, when Earth is being attacked, they'll act like this all hasn't happened a quadrillion times before. Amy doesn't recall the Dalek invasion and she probably doesn't recall the Sycorax, Harold Saxon's Toclafanes, the Racnoss or frickin Gallifrey almost smashing into Earth. This probably means that future episodes won't recall it either but in truth, I don't really care. *Doctor Who* is about enjoying the story and the characters. You could probably pick off a lot of things that don't make sense from past episodes (TV movie says the Doctor is half-human so I guess that means that the half-human Doctor from series 4 is a quarter human wtf?). I know I'm being hypocritical because of my lengthy response but don't worry about it. It'll drive you absolutely insane. Just have fun; the show's quite literally about escapism. 

Finally, we shouldn't put Matt Smith against David Tennant yet. It isn't fair because Tennant was the Doctor for 4 years compared to Matt's 1.5.

Nobody remembers the Toclafanes aside from The Doctor, the Jones Family, and Captain Jack. I don't recall if the Doctor asked Amy about any of the other races that attacked Earth.

Perhaps the comparison to Matt Smith and David Tennant is unfair. It's more about the direction and writing of the show under Davies vs. Moffat. 

Under Davies, the show was by and large, internally consistent. It seemed respectful of the source material, and tried to leave things untouched where it could. Within 3 episodes of Moffat being in charge they were completely throwing out what happened just a little while ago, and that kinda bothers me. I could just be totally wrong though, as I haven't actually seen 60-80's Doctor Who (though I am considering remedying that).

Overall, I really do like Moffat's writing, as I mentioned earlier ""Blink"" is what got me hooked on the series in the first place. I just think it's important with a story focusing on time travel, that some events are fixed and unchangeable. That was a point that was stressed a lot under Davies (though they would circumvent that in cutesy ways).",0,1295398158,null,0,false,0,c1d9zu3,t3_f4ouu,t1_c1d9zu3,t1_c1d9t3y,1426703063,2,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,2

If it didn't exist they'd be even worse off.

&gt;youre all also stupid for believing its ok to prevent people sticking to the principals of their religion.

Simply because the country is called Christian does not mean everyone is subject to Christian law. You are allowed to follow whatever you wish, you are just not allowed to discriminate based on sexual orientation in opposition to the law. What would be the point of allowing religious freedom only to infringe on personal freedom? [Source](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equality_Act_(Sexual_Orientation\)_Regulations)

This couple IS married, civil partnerships have to be treated in the same way as marriages according to the Equality Act, which is why a court ruled against them

For a cartoon in the Daily Mail? This is not analysing poetry, you claimed they did not appear homosexual. They are holding hands and renting a bridal suite, and with all due respect, Mac is not a subtle cartoonist.

&gt; i think they are perfectly entitled to adhere to their religious beliefs and that it is their rights that have been infringed upon.

It's a business. If you have a business in the UK, you follow UK laws and regulations. They discriminated based on sexual preference, judging others for their 'sin'. It could just have easily been judging people for being Jewish or of a different ethnic origin. This is not acceptable in modern society, regardless of who your deity is. 

&gt;using your argument of law it would suggest that until equality laws came into place you would have sided with the hoteliers.

Would I have sided with the hoteliers on a legal battle against homosexual rights if there was no legal precedent and acts supporting or opposing them? I'm not well schooled enough in the law to tell you. At this present time however, I am aware of their rights. 

Of course, that's not what you want for a response. You're asking whether my personal opinion is that religious freedom is higher or lower than personal freedom within your own house. You're then backing up your point with your opinion that if I agree with the system I'm merely an idiot who cannot make up his own mind on complex moral issues. The slightly amusing part of this being that to "" have your morals and principals dictated to you"" is precisely what this Christian couple had, and you're arguing for them. My opinion is that personal freedom and religious freedom must come with the restriction that they do not infringe on others, and whilst I would have no objection to a couple denying others a room for the night in their own house, it isn't _just_ their own house any more. It's a business, and a place where the two men went expecting a room for the night, only to be denied it on the basis of what some deity dislikes. Personally I find that unethical, and a little mean too. 

Then you've got the bigger issue to do with if the courts had rules in the favour of the hoteliers:

* If the law supported this it would suggest the law is in favour of bigotry


Oh, and ""i think you have to have a screw loose to believe in god."" Seriously? That's just mean man, if they want to believe in it, I think you should let them without insulting them. I oppose them openly, but I wouldn't call them insane.

tl;dr apologies, ill read after dinner

they did not discriminate on sexual preference, they discriminated against unmarried couples, on religious grounds, regardless of sexual preference. the judge accepted they had also turned away unmarried heterosexual couples in the hotels 25yr history.

their objection was not one of law, it was of religion, thus the civil union is meaningless.

i suspected you were going to say this...
&gt; The slightly amusing part of this being that to "" have your morals and principals dictated to you"" is precisely what this Christian couple had, and you're arguing for them

my point is that to have morals dictated to you by law subjects them to arbitrarily changing from day to day. you cant base your morals and principals on whether something is legal or not. would someone have a moral objection to marijuana in america, but not in amsterdam ? =)

but having said that... im not defending their stance, im defending their right to hold that stance in their own property. they didnt seek to impose their beliefs on those people. they offer a service to everyone with the condition that if they want a double bed then they should be married, if you cant abide by that condition then dont pursue their service. its that simple, why should homosexual couples receive preferential treatment over heterosexual couples ?

&gt;there is a huge difference between discriminating against someone for who they are, as opposed to discriminating against peoples actions. this is nothing like apartheid.

So what you're saying is that homosexuality is merely an action, rather than an orientation? /r/LGBT would have a field day with you. People are homosexual in the same way I am heterosexual, it's who I'm attracted to. 

&gt;they are offering a service on abidance to a condition, if you dont want to abide then dont request the service, go somewhere else.

That is bigotry, regardless of whether it's about sex, race or orientation. You also seem to be missing a crucial point. It ceases to just be their home when there's a business involved, it becomes a case of legality, and it's illegal to discriminate based on sexual orientation. 

&gt;why should homosexual couples receive preferential treatment to heterosexual couples ?

Preferential? Preferential is being allowed to pay for a service? If they were allowed the service, this is how it would work: 

Heterosexual: Pays and can stay in a room with their partner.

Homosexual: Pays and can stay in a room with their partner.

I can't see any advantage to either there.

true,urine_luck,null,null,"&gt; Aside from under the law, they are technically married. Their dispute was that homosexual marriage does not constitute marriage.

according to their religious beliefs it doesnt and they imposed the same religious condition on heterosexual couples.

&gt; So what you're saying is that homosexuality is merely an action, rather than an orientation? /r/LGBT would have a field day with you. People are homosexual in the same way I am heterosexual, it's who I'm attracted to.

no, the 'action' is the sleeping in the same bed. the same religious condition they imposed on heterosexual couples.

&gt; That is bigotry, regardless of whether it's about sex, race or orientation.

yes it is a bigotry that i believe they are entitled to impose in their own home when they are offering a service.

&gt; Preferential? Preferential is being allowed to pay for a service?

its preferential because you are suggesting they not have to abide by the same condition as heterosexual couples wishing to stay at the hotel.


i dont consider the 'oppression' of peoples beliefs under their roof to be advancement in society. this is hypocrisy... people in this thread imposing their beliefs on others.

true,DogBotherer,null,null,"It's a bit information-dense but:

Consensus, consistency, and distinctiveness are all considered when interpreting the cause of a behavior. Consensus refers to whether others behave identically in the given situation. Consistency refers to whether the individual behaves identically from case to case in the given situation. Distinctiveness refers to whether the individual behaves identically when the given situation is changed. In other words, distinctiveness describes whether the behavior is unique to the particular circumstance or manifests across a wide variety of circumstances. Kelley proposed that the levels of these three behavioral co-variables provide the informational basis or assessing the behavior of a person. Kelley’s attribution cube predicts that if consensus is perceived as high (everybody behaves this way in this scenario), consistency is perceived as high (the individual always behaves this way in this given scenario), and distinctiveness is perceived as high (the behavior is unique and distinct to the given scenario), then the circumstances of an event will be attributed as having caused the action. On the other hand, the cube predicts that if consistency is high (the individual always behaves this way in this scenario) while both consensus and distinctiveness are low (nobody else acts this way in this scenario, and he always acts like this regardless of the scenario), then the traits of the individual will be implicated as having caused an event. Other combinations of behaviorally covariant information result in ambiguity as to the locus of causation in the mind of the observer who is attempting to interpret whether external social circumstances or internal traits caused a particular behavior to occur.

Why would anyone choose to pour hot wax onto their genitals and legs, let it cool and then *rip out the hairs*?  Why would anyone choose to wear uncomfortable shoes all day every day that cause foot, leg and back-pain?  Because it's a cultural affectation that some people feel pressured to do, some resent but choose to do anyway, and that many get used to, and do practically their entire lives without even thinking about it.

Sure there are some women who are forced to wear the Burqua, but there are also a lot who *choose* to, and don't consider it any more of an imposition than western women consider waxing or makeup, or western men consider shaving.

Personally I'm not fond of the idea of the Burqua, but I'm also not culturally chauvinist enough to assume it's anything other than a cultural affectation for the majority of women who wear it.  And equally, I'm not ignorant and prejudiced enough to assume that because *culturally* oppression of women is common in the Middle East, that means Islam (which is also *often* prevalent in *similar*, though not not isomorphic, regions) *necessarily causes* oppression of women (as opposed to the prevailing culture of the area).

For example, obesity is prevalent in the West, and the West is culturally Christian.  Does that mean *Christianity makes you fat*?  No, of course not, because that's clearly retarded.

&gt; I wonder how this myth of Islamic women being badly treated got started then?

Ah well, if we're accepting ""reasoning by popular stereotype"" as a legitimate intellectual rationale and debating tactic then all Americans are fat and retarded, all Britons are sexually repressed and arrogant, all French are smelly cowards, all Italians are organised criminals, all Germans are humourless Nazis, all Mexicans are smelly and lazy, all Greeks are homosexual paedophiles, etc, etc, etc.

I have to say, that was a *stunningly* stupid line of reasoning.

But, if you *really need* need a simple answer, it's because like you, most people have distinct trouble remembering that *correlation does not imply causation*.

The idea is that instead of the DoH giving money to Strategic Health Authorities, who then give it to Primary Care Trusts, who then give it to doctors, dentists etc, the money is given straight to the GP Consortium's, who then give it to hospitals and so forth. The problem with this is that most GP's will be trained in medicine, and not the required business skills needed to manage the huge amount of money that will be given to them. This means they will most likely contract out the management of the budget to a private health firm, who will run the budget for them.

This is not a US style system at all, this is a weird British invention. It does decrease the amount of management in the NHS, which lets face it, was a popular jibe against the NHS under Labour. 

Honestly, while I don't have an issue with private sector involvement in the health service, most EU nations have this, I'm not so sure this will work as intended. A much better idea would be for hospitals et al to not be provided a budget for patient care, just for staff and kit, and then send the bill for treatment back to you insurance provider who is the state, or a private firm (if you choose this option).

true,Shaper_pmp,null,null,"&gt; So if I understand you correctly, any 'quirks' of Islam

No.  First, these things are quirks *of the country's culture, not of Islam* (any more than fatness is a quirk of Christianity).  So calling all Muslims woman-oppressors is silly (like calling all Christians fat).

So, point 1: By calling such behaviour ""Muslim"" you mis-attribute the cause of it and make yourself sound ignorant and prejudiced. Call it cultural if you want to criticise it, or call the country/culture concerned barbaric, but don't say ""Muslims are bad because they do X"", when it's not ""Muslims"" in general that do it.

&gt; are alright because they are 'cultural' so that makes it all fine and dandy?

Point 2: There's a related but wholly separate point here; that because *we* wouldn't want to wear the Burqua (and would need to be actively forced to do so), we automatically assume that anyone else would need forcing to do so, and must resent it.

That's not necessarily true, as my other example showed; I'd need ""forcing"" to rip all the hairs out of my crotch, but plenty of people in *our* society choose to do it *completely voluntarily*, so obviously what *I* think of it is not a flawless guide to what *they* think of it.

That's not to descend into the hippy mire of cultural relativism - I'm not saying you can't judge these societies, just that you have to be careful to judge them on objective grounds, and not merely confuse your half-assed understanding of them for objective fact.

When you say ""why would anyone choose to wear this"" (with the implication that they wouldn't, so it must be forced) you reveal your ignorant assumption that they think the same way you do.  After all, ""why would anyone choose to rip out their own public hair with hot wax""?

Well, I'm not entirely sure either, but they do.  So the implication that *all* of these women are *necessarily* being forced into wearing a Burqa is false, as many don't care, or don't even think about it.  In fact, one of the biggest cultural groups supporting things like Burqa-wearing or even female genital mutilation in many traditional societies are often *older women*, who are at least theoretically themselves the ""victims"" of such oppressive acts.  Strange but true.

That's not to say that a *national or ethnic culture* hiding women from view doesn't objectify women in the society, or that it doesn't encourage men to rape or attack them and then blame the victim for being insufficiently modest, or that it's fair or right for women to be treated as second-class citizens.  You can even criticise *Muslims* for delusionally believing in an invisible sky-daddy without a shred of evidence.

Those are all completely fair criticisms, but you didn't make any of those.

I'm no fan of religion, and the last thing I want to do is to have to defend Islam (or any other religion).  However, if you're going to be any better than the kind of fundamentalist fuckwit you're criticising, you have to make sure you're *right in what you criticise*, and you're *criticising the right groups* given your criticisms.

Criticise much of Middle Eastern culture for oppressing women - fair enough.  Criticise the social or cultural implications of the Burqa, and I'll agree.  Criticise Isalm (and almost any other mainstream religion) for the violence of its imagery, the bronze-age morality and the ludicrous claims without a shred of evidence to support them, and I've got your back 100%.

But post ""LOL Mooslems are teh gay becoz tey all hates women"" and I'll point out how ignorant and stupid your position is, and how the criticisms you level are not actually valid criticisms of the specific group you're aiming them at, because otherwise you're little better than a creationist ignorantly criticising evolution because ""if we evolved from monkeys then *how come there are still monkeys*, huh?"". :-/",0,1295529730,null,0,true,0,c1dhgrk,t3_f5o9e,t1_c1dhgrk,t1_c1dhczn,1426706619,6,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,6

No, just repeating statements I have heard. If you think I am against teaching history then you misunderstand me.

My point is about skills. Yeah the Corn Laws are important, but so are a lot of things. There is not time to go into each one in the depth they require. The best solution to my mind is to teach kids how to analyse history. This can probably be best done by teaching one area in depth (maybe even the Corn Laws), but using this as a means of teaching the method, which can be applied to other areas, as and when the kid has a need for it.

Gove's states, that 'in the history curriculum we only have two names [of historical figures], in the geography curriculum the only country we mention is the UK'. He completely doesn't understand what geography is about, and probably history too. I've heard people say this stuff too. It sounds like he is calling for a rote learning, as was done in the past.

I think when you have 5 to 7 years of two or three lessons a week you can suffer allocating time to to more than one topic.  You can't hope to get any understand of how to ""analyse history"" (I think you mean ""Historiography"") by analysing one single period or topic.  

What's more, I think you're underestimating the importance of history when you treat the subject matter as entirely unimportant.  The subject matter is important.  The reform era is of critical value for understanding how the West has developed, because at the time the British Empire was a trailblazing example of a liberal state.  The slave trade and abolition is of critical value for understanding how politics of race has worked not only in America but also in Africa and Europe.  The corn law period is of critical value to understanding where modern economics comes from, why there is such a hostility to protectionism, why there is such an interest in trade and inter-cooperation, etc.

Gove talks about the lack of a ""connected narrative"" in the teaching of British history. That is a phrase sometimes to used to bemoan the fact that kids are not taught the important names and events in UK history from 1066 on, usually until 1914, with the Romans thrown in as well. It does not allow for the in depth analysis you describe and is very UK centric. In this type of history you learn what year the corn laws were introduced, but not their effects.

The article says 'Writing in the Daily Telegraph on Thursday, he lamented the absence in the curriculum of figures such as Winston Churchill, Florence Nightingale and Horatio Nelson.' Together with other statements he has made, I think we can get a fairly good idea where he is coming from. It is not a new idea, nor unique to him. 

Also consider that there has been discussion in education circles about dropping history entirely, it'll give you an insight into some of the background.

I'm not sure someone would make the point. Which is an awful shame.

Non-religious are currently the majority in Great Britain. Latest census showed 50.7% non religious, ~40% christian and 5% other. I'll edit a source in later when I find it.

I also estimate that of the christian portion the majority would be elderly people. Without being callous I certainly know some of the very old in my family are religious (albeit the minority) and I would be happily surprised if they lived another 10 years for another census.

According to the national statistics 20%* of the population are 65+. I would suggest the majority fall into the christian or other religious faiths bracket. This could all be conjecture on my part. I just don't see many people my age turning to religion anymore. Thank God.

No, I'm analysing your argument to show the misconceptions you hold.  I have attributed to you statements that you implicitly hold because of your conclusions (ie: you hold the idea that coverage of facts is unimportant compared to ""method"").  This actually isn't a big jump, you've said it near outright on a number of occasions.

Saying that you simply oppose rote learning of facts is a pretty big departure from your earlier comments.  Actually, you've gone a lot further than to oppose just rote learning.

You've said that you think history can ""can probably be best done by teaching one area"".   You are mistaken.  No matter to what depth that single area is taught, you are loosing most of the value of the subject of history by simply omitting it.  ""Historical method"" is a fine thing to learn, but it's not the only thing related to history, nor is it a particularly important thing.  It's actually more important to learn the issues involved with major political/social changes than simply reinforce in students the ability to ""analyse"".

There's no other place to put this, but I just wanted to say that the idea that someone under the new or any old system could be able to learn about the dates of the corn laws without covering what actually happened is nonsense.  I don't believe this fictional education system you say either did exist or will that teaches dates about the corn laws without talking about the price rises they caused ever did or ever realistically will exist.  You have some strange antipathy towards the rote learning of dates that is so strong that you seem to have some kind of complex.  Dates are an important and pretty much necessary part of learning history.  If you don't know when an event happened in the sequence and proportion of others, you don't know an awful lot.

I think being UK-centric is probably not a terrible thing.  For one, the subjects of any new curriculum will live in the UK and the history of the social structures and political ideas that affect them is important.  Another not inconsiderable fact is that the history of Britain is pretty important.  A lot of significant political, philosophical and religious ideas originated here.  Britain probably ranks along with Ancient Greece, Ancient Rome and others in terms of the influence it has had on politics and philosophy, especially in the world outside of Old Europe.

Ofcom delivered their report to the Secretary of State on 31st December 2010.  Jeremy is now considering the report carefully.  He has been clear that he will take as much time as necessary to come to a fully considered decision and he rightly believes that it is more important to come to the right conclusion rather than work to an arbitrary timescale.  In taking this decision, it is open to the Secretary of State to take representations. Jeremy feels, however, that it would detract from the decision making process to provide a running commentary on what, if any, discussions he is having.  I can assure you that the Secretary of State, in line with his statutory duty, will be publishing Ofcom’s report in due course either before or at the time of the announcement of his decision.
Due to the Secretary of State’s quasi-judicial role it is not possible to provide any further details at the moment but I fully support his commitment to reach a decision in a fair and even-handed way.  Further details about this process will be announced once the Secretary of State’s decision has been made public.
I shall be following developments carefully and thank you again for taking the time to contact me.",0,1295552286,null,0,true,0,c1dj2wp,t3_f1lvs,t1_c1dj2wp,t3_f1lvs,1426707373,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

true,Axius,uk,United Kingdom,"Given that the focus of History as an academic subject needs a firm rooting in analysis and the capacity to critically analyse, I feel forcing students to list facts and dates has no real place at a foundation level as they are simply a list of 'what happened' which does not encourage anyone to try develop their thoughts beyond that.

If you assume History to be a solid set of dates and people with events with fixed meanings, you lose out on the analysis which ultimately renders the entire subject pointless. You cannot learn a lesson from studying history if you are told what that lesson is - this is the analysis that History fails to teach until you reach an academic standard and I feel needs addressing a lot sooner. On this, I feel NotThatOtherGuy is correct - the skills for studying history SHOULD be taught as a priority against a dedicated framework of a specific example, and then you can start to give students the facts and figures for them to personally dissect. This would lead to a much better skillset for students of History whilst also promoting the individuality of students and helping them develop exactly what the Curriculum should be promoting - useful personal skills.

I appreciate what you say about the merit of studying the relevance of the Corn Laws, but on a fundamental level at the beginning of studying history, if you force a list of dates on a student you will force them to disengage with the more relevant parts of history. Chronology rather than a list of hard facts is more useful to encourage the development of analytical skills in my opinion.

It is rather amusing from my perspective having read up on the historiography of the subject to see someone (Gove, it seems from what he says in this article) who wants a return to the telling of tales of 'great people' as a focus in history. It's very old fashioned, exceptionally ignorant of the bigger picture and in many ways ends up being self-congratulatory as a priority due to the nature of the reasons for studying an individual of cultural significance.

As for the role of Britain - I would not be so quick to say they are that important. I would instead consider Europe as a bloc to have been exceptionally relevant for the last few centuries. Ideas and influences and the development and concepts of various movements such as Marxism and Nationalism have strong roots within the various European relationships. Napoleon's Empire and the ties this has to the subsequent union of Germany, for example, have ties that are linked to Britain and her role as a world power. Europe has done a lot more for itself and each member state than I think most people care to imagine. 

It is however, very important to not 'grade' periods of history as more important. 1700 - 1900 Britain may have some relevant history, such as the beginnings of the Labour party, the Poor Law, the Great Reform Act (and subsequent acts), the concept of the Industrial Revolution, the creation of the British Empire, etc. but the last 100 years also has some exceptionally relevant material. 

In the last 100 years, we've seen the final steps of the creation of a national concept of 'Britishness', we've seen the proliferation of motorised transport and networks of roads that have bound together near enough every city in the United Kingdom. There's been two World Wars that hurt the population of the country massively, further electoral reform that brought women into a fairer society, the creation of the United Nations and what this did for the UK, the creation of the NHS and the Welfare State as part of a 'socialist but not quite socialist' post-WW2 society... there's been a lot of stuff.

Sorry, you seem to have taken a far more date-centric reading of me than I ever meant to convey.  I'm not pro-""boring dates"" (who is this imaginary person we all dislike?).  It's just that some use of dates is something you pretty much have to accept as a necessary evil.

I've not being trying to make the case that analysis is unimportant.  I've been trying to make the case that coverage is important and currently done pretty badly.

I think you have the wrong perception of 1700-1900.  Not only did Scotland have arguably the most influential intellectual enlightenment, but there was one of the most important epistemological movements, huge electoral reform, the agricultural revolution, the industrial revolution (which to your credit you mentioned), a popular anarchism movement, the invention and popularisation of Marxism, the Corn Laws, the foundation and popularisation of modern liberalism, the largest empire the world has ever seen, etc etc.  Comparing the British C20 with C18-C19 is a bit like comparing the late stages of the Ottoman Empire with the Islamic Golden Age.  They just aren't the same thing.

Charlie Brooker wasn't at *all* up to his usual standard. The Palin short was infantile. His non-scripted parts were just lacking somehow. I think he might get better with time, though.

Jimmy Carr wasn't that funny. He had a few wise cracks surrounded by rubbish. The Tunisia skit wasn't funny. His interview was Bjorg Lomborg was crap. He didn't challenge him on *any* of the major problems that most environmental scientists have with his views- he's a very very controversial figure, why didn't he challenge him properly rather than just making wise cracks. it was silly. Mitchell should have done that interview.

Laverne was absolutely awful. Her World News thing. What the fuck. It was meant to be a parody of bad news...by doing a bad news segment. It was just dire. Then on the round table discussions she came up with something to the effect of 'Wouldn't it be weird if Yvette Cooper and Ed Balls were in the Cabinet together?' I was speechless. She shouldn't be allowed to be on a political themed show if she's *that* ignorant. Her contributions to the round table banter seemed to be accurately portraying the stereotype of a blonde bimbo. I felt *bad* for woman watching that. Is that really the highest calibre female politically inclined comic they could find?

Mitchell's interviews were both great. He was funny, engaging and asked intelligent questions without being too forward. He needs to stop saying people's full names, though. His interviews were *way* too short. They could have comfortably been twice as long.

The whole show was extremely disjointed. It went all over the place. You just flicked from one interview to a skit to an interview to a pre-prepared video. It doesn't work as a format.

If the show is to be saved they need to cut Laverne entirely (this wouldn't pass with the requiring a token woman comic though, maybe they can find a better one?). They need to cut one of Jimmy Carr/Brooker. I'd prefer to keep Brooker. They need to get rid of the sections which are basically just improv stand-up- just have the Mitchell, Brooker/Carr bantering about the days events and see what happens naturally. HIGNFY is *much* funnier. They need a celebrity-esque guest each episode to stay on the round table the whole time with the permanent hosts. If each week it was one of the myriad of different people who guests on QI/HIGNFY it would add dynamicism.

They need to cut out half the stupid flashing lights which distract and make it look like we're watching a cheap gameshow. They need to put it on the BBC so it doesn't feel like there's an advert after every segment, or they need to put one double-length advert break on after half an hour.

Or they could just cut the entire show into just ""The David Mitchell Show"", have one half-hour long banter/interview with a guest each week and it would be a quality show which I'd watch every week.

Massively, massively disappointed. Charlie Brooker and Mitchell are two of my favourite observational comics but this thing just sucked.

I was watching it with my Dad. He got up and left halfway through the Brooker Palin sketch, went to watch Question Time. He probably would have watched the whole thing if they didn't punctuate the interesting interview with stupid gag reels.
