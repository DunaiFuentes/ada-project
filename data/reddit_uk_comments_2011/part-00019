Hell, I should know, I did it the other way, moved from the UK to Canada.

A TV license is a must. You can be heavily fined for not having one. When you purchase a TV from a store, such as Currys, Comet or even Tesco, you will be asked for your home address. This is a requirement by law that shops must ask for this information.

Internet access. For example, [Be* There](https://www.bethere.co.uk/) for DSL would cost around 25GBP/month for unlimited, unlike the $60+ packages you get from the likes of the cable companies here in Canada. I'm paying around $70/month for my Videotron cable Internet with a cap of 120GB. I miss the Internet companies in the UK.

Living in London can be VERY expensive. Try looking outside of the city, you'll find places much cheaper and close to public transport. 

Oh yeah, in the UK, we drive on the left, the steering wheel is on the right. If you want to have a UK drivers license, you'll need to contact the [DVLA](http://www.dvla.gov.uk/). Car insurance isn't cheap and you must be insured to drive the car you own. It's very different to here in Canada, your license does not insure you.

true,abw,cnty-uk,Surrey,"A fine round-up.  

A couple of minor things: *tosser* and *wanker* are only masturbatory reference in passing.  I guess it's like calling someone a *jerk-off* or a *jerk* in NA.  The implication is that the person is an idiot, not necessarily that they frequently masturbate.  In the UK, we also enjoy using the hand gesture, as demonstrated pictorially in the [Wikipedia page](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wanker) on the subject.

Also, Brown Sauce != BBQ Sauce (as discussed elsewhere) and our mustards are known as English Mustard (bright yellow and hot), American Mustard (bright yellow and mild), French Mustard (dark brown and hot) and various other speciality mustards like wholegrain, Dijon, etc.  

Salad cream is only like mayonnaise in the way that ranch dressing is.  Salad cream is a cheaper alternative to mayonnaise that is typically eaten by the lower classes.  Or as we would say in the UK: ""salad cream is eaten by common people and mayonnaise is eaten by posh people"".

On matters of profanity, we consider anal sex a suitable subject for casual insults.  Telling someone to ""bugger off"" or ""sod off"" is quite acceptable.  *Cunt* is the most offensive word you can say in the UK, but it's considered quite acceptable to call a close male friend a ""silly cunt"".  It's generally best not to use the word in the company of women unless you've heard them use it themselves (and if you do hear a woman use it, you can be fairly certain that she's a chavvy slapper, and thus best avoided).  Alternately, *twat* is a milder derivative of *cunt* that is more generally acceptable in the company of women and those of a delicate disposition.

Tipping anywhere is entirely optional, wait staff by law are paid at least minimum wage, often more. Generally tipping is only for very very good service if you're feeling generous, most people don't tip ever and it's definitely not expected. 



&gt;School goes from Year 1 to 11, with GCSEs and then an optional 2 extra years called ""Sixth Form"" followed by A Level exams

we have sixth form colleges, so when someone referes to college, they are talking about where they did their A levels and college age is 16 - 18 usually, uni (university) is after college.



&gt;Instead of having lots of police cruisers catching speeders, they have speed cameras which measure your average speed by using lines on the road.

In addition our police do not carry guns.

as has been said before, brown sauce is completely different to bbq sauce, if you would like bbq sauce most places have it, you just have to ask.

At the moment newspapers survive because it is difficult to set up print and distribution chains. It is incredibly expensive to even get to the point where you are failing due to facing an established brand.

For web distribution those costs are negligible. True you still face the brand recognition problem but it doesn't cost you much to take it on. You aren't going to go bankrupt trying this.

I reckon he is (sort of) half human and his mum is none other than Donna Noble!

We know the mysterious woman in The End Of Time who kept pestering Wilf was intended by RTD to be the Doctor's mother. And we know that Donna is a Time Lady/human hybrid. I reckon after Donna had a long happy lottery-winners' life, and when she was on her deathbed she suddenly regenerated into a healthy second-regeneration Time Lady - with all her memories restored and a proper Time Lord brain that can handle it all.

Now biologically Gallifreyan, she eventually somehow finagles her way back to Gallifrey, has a Time Lord husband and a son (the Doctor) and - a thousand or more years later in her timestream and many regenerations down the line - is a member of the High Council during the Time War. She did tell her son she was born human and bade him keep it secret, but kept schtum about her former life as Donna Noble Temple

This explains a lot of things - it explains why Donna is the only female companion not amorously interested in the Doctor (she's his MUM) - and it explains why the mysterious lady kept pestering Wilf in the End Of Time - he's her old gramps. And maybe, just maybe, it explains why Wilf could find the Doctor so easily if he's the Doctor's great grandfather.

FTFY.

I think what amuses me the most about republicans is that their protests against our undemocractic head of state just gives more publicity to the monarchy than they would have recieved normally. (You know, assuming Will and Kate weren't getting married.)

I think a key fallacy with republican reasoning against the monarchy is that they're assuming *the monarchy actually has any power*. Or affects the government in any way.

What I mean is the monarchy ""rules"" (and I use the term loosely) by consent, i.e. there's a keen social-political understanding between us ""commoners"" and the Queen; we let her remain head of state, and she doesn't interfere with the running of our *democratic* government. In return she and her family represent us accross the world (adding a certain ""prestige"" to our international dealings) as well as bringing in tourism (yes, she may not be the number one attraction but it's still there) and linking us to a larger international community; the Commonwealth.

So essentially: the instant the Queen tries to use any of the power she does have, we'd immediately kick her off the throne. It's as simple as that really. This is why I always look quizically at those who say we're not living in a democracy. I **do** live in a democracy. Or are those elections I participate in every so many years not actually mean anything? You know, the democractic elections which vote in a government which actually rules the country on a day to day basis and actually makes all of the real decisions?

The point is the monarchy brings a certain charm and traditional national pride to the country. In a day and age where we're committed to objectionable conflicts, ridiculously high education fees, high prescription fees and far-reaching public spending cuts which harm and affect us all, there isn't really that much to be proud about anymore...

The rule for a tv license is that you only need one if you are watching a live broadcast or have an arial plugged into your TV. That means without one you are not allowed to watch *live* bbc streams over the internet for example, although it seems rather unlikely they would know.

&gt;Assisted suicide is surely preferable to a slow and painful death, or a failed attempt resulting in permanent injury and illness.

That's what I meant by a terminal illness or a compromised quality of life. If you're suffering from a permanent illness/injury which may or may not result in death then you and others might consider your quality of life compromised.

My reasoning for not wanting assisted suicide for sound-minded and healthy people is because it *could* result in a deterioration of society as a whole if we all decided to start killing ourselves. But then I suppose you could argue that it doesn't matter if you legalize it for everyone because sound-minded healthy people won't *want* to kill themselves! One would hope... (Otherwise suicide rates would be much higher than they are currently I would assume)

I suppose my main concern if it was legalized for everyone regardless of any criteria is that the clinically depressed would choose assisted suicide over life. You could argue that the clinically depressed aren't ""sound of mind"" and hence wouldn't qualify for assisted suicide, but depression can be very hard to diagnose sometimes. My sister was severely depressed during and after university, we feared she might kill herself. Several years later she's now happily married with a young daughter, if she'd been legally allowed to end her life then her life would have been wasted and my niece would never have existed.",0,1303138124,null,0,false,0,c1q0s58,t3_gslig,t1_c1q0s58,t1_c1q0mq5,1427077374,6,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,6

As to these characters.. of course it's not ""really them"". It's all fictional characters. We can talk about whether it's canonical or not, but what about being canonical says that something is cosplay or not?

It's like saying ""what is art?"" Who gets to say if something I created is art or not? Sure, maybe it's not going into a museum, but don't tell me that something I create isn't art.

Cosplay is about expressing your feelings about a character, or expressing yourself through that character, or I mean, it doesn't even need to involve a character (TARDIS isn't a character). It's just about expression through a costume, and that's it. I don't see why it needs to be restricted more than that.

I'd have a hard time calling a band tee a 'costume'.. clearly it's a stretch, and I mean, it would be a damn shitty cosplay, but if you really feel like you are expressing something by it, then knock yourself out. I don't think it's at all fair to compare wearing custom-made Dalek dresses to wearing a band tee, though.

Basically I don't see any need to be elitist about what is cosplay and what is not. If you want to dress up as a character, or something related to a character, or whatever, if there's a costume involved, I'm willing to call it cosplay.

Manchester City are three points ahead of Spurs but Spurs have a game in hand (but with 12 inferior goal difference).

Liverpool are 4 points behind Spurs but Spurs have two games in hand.  We also have to play them.

Spurs run in is (WBA, che, BLP, mcy, liv, BIR).  If we beat them that's 3 points back, they could also lose both games in hand against che and mcy, leaving still 1 point to drop against WBA, BLP and BIR, and that's if we win all our games (BIR, NEW, ful, TOT, avl).  Unlikely?

If Spurs beat mcy and win all their games, they're relying on MCY to drop points against one of (bla, WHM, eve, STK, bol).  Could happen I suppose but that relies on Spurs beating Chelsea and us.

Amazon.co.uk is more like the American Amazon site, in that you can buy pretty much anything, unlike the generally useless Amazon.ca.  I find online shopping in general to be a lot better here.

In general, housing and restaurants will be more expensive, especially right in London, but I'm sure you already knew that.  However, sometimes buying groceries can be cheaper, depending on what you get and where you go.  For example, chicken wings are way cheaper here.  You can get some cheap veggies, pastas and other things in places like Lidl.

We can't even own guns to protect our own land. 

The difference though, and the reason why making guns legal in the UK would never work now, is a cultural one. I read on here about a lad who was about 6 or 7, and his friend knew where his dads gun was. He got it out, and started playing with it. However the lad who had written the comment said when his friend was playing with the gun he went ape shit and told him to put it away, and he did. He said he went mad because he remembers his dad explaining in detail how to use a gun, but to remember it is NOT A TOY, AND IT DOES KILL PEOPLE. He told him where it was so that the little lad could protect the house, should need arise... We wouldn't have that same attitude or education surrounding guns in this country.

true,EvilDrReef,smith,Smith,"Speaking of shadowy figures rushing by the camera, is the general consensus about the shadowy figure at 15:53 in The Eleventh Hour that it's Prisoner Zero? Because now I'm not so sure.

Consider the following. A few moments before, the Doctor sort of glances at the door where Prisoner Zero eventually hides out and claims to be missing something, indicating that the perception filter is already established. Plus, the Doctor does eventually return to the house and realize what he's missed (i.e. the door), so the filter had to have been there on his first visit. 

Secondly, Prisoner Zero requires ""months"" to acquire a new form. Either it's been there long enough that it's already molded an Amelia form, or it's not Prisoner Zero that runs past. Plus, based on the scale of that window, I'd say it's modeled after an adult body, so it wouldn't be Amelia. And it definitely couldn't have modeled an Amelia's aunt body because that was never a form that showed up in the climax (and her aunt was never mentioned to be in a coma at the hospital).

The problem is, a lot of the area has been rather run down for many years now, and like the article says, it is only a big business that could afford the rates, and the initial cost of renovation. This is the view that the council has taken while it has been ignoring the protests from the thousands of local residents and business owners regarding the planning permission.  
While I believe a campaign to raise awareness of the local community and to help to boycott the new Tesco would be beneficial, any  'direct action' would just imply that the area needs even more 'renovation.'

We get a claim that republicanism increasing during her reign - I'm not sure about that, not at all. Support for a republic is one of the most stable measures in British polling, usually placed around the 18% mark and has been since the sixties.

I've not heard anything to suggest that this is anything new. I could be wrong of course; I'd love to see evidence.

And yet, the main arguments for monarchy remain pretty well untouched - a ceremonial head of state who is non-partisan, is capable of cultivating long-term relationships with foreign heads of state where ceremonial presidents often fail (term limits), a head of state who is guaranteed not to be a politician, someone who is heavily incentivised not to use their reserve powers unless necessary (election has a terrible habit of making politicians feel they need to act, often when they don't IMO).",0,1303233045,null,0,false,0,c1q81rr,t3_gtoux,t1_c1q81rr,t3_gtoux,1427080865,5,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,5

true,lopsiness,lfc12,,"&gt; You'd stop a game for TEN minutes to dispute an off-sides call.

This argument is so fucking stupid. 

It doesn't take 10 minutes to dispute a call. On big calls involving red cards and goals, by the the time the game restarts we've all watched half a dozen replays or more on tv, why not use the same amount of time for the 4th official to rewatch and tell the field ref. Or just let the field ref look at the replay himself. Takes a minute. No one is going to be stopping games for 10 minutes at a time b/c someone was flagged offsides. 

All people think is that every foul is going to result in stopped time, but it doesn't. American football allows 2 challenges for the team. That's it. Why would soccer suddenly decide to introduce a challenge every single whistle blow rule? 

You review goals and reds, maybe each coach gets a challenge. Hell, they can do it like hockey and continue the game while the 4th official reviews the play. People are so quick to dismiss these ideas, I hardly think they even consider how to do them.

true,sylvan,tom-baker,Tom Baker,"To my mind, a spoiler needs to be sufficiently specific that one's enjoyment of an episode may be foreseeably reduced. ""Amy Pond is in Series 6"" cannot be reasonably considered a spoiler, because she is a major character in the show, and anyone would expect she would appear. ""The Master is the villain in episode 5"" *would be*, because knowing that in advance might spoil the suspense/surprise of watching episode 5. (I made the latter up.)

As I said above, if you have *not* watched the previews, or been participating/reading fan discussion to know what ""The Silence"" is or may be, then the term itself holds no meaning, and cannot reasonably (in my opinion) be construed as to spoil any particular episode of Season 5, nor the entire season. Further, as the title refers to 5, not 6, it doesn't spoil any details of season 6. If you *have* been watching previews or reading fan speculation about season 6, such that you *know what ""The Silence"" are, then you have already been spoiled, to what extent any minor mention of ""The Silence"" is capable of, and so the title cannot act as additional spoiler.

As a decade-long Cambridge resident, I have noticed some generalities that are actually biases based on my personal experiences. But ho hum.

Trinity = rich, difficult to get into, and honestly, often amazingly snobbish FOR Cambridge. Somehow. 

Kings = student politics. Urgh.

Caius = biggest geeks. eg Ultimate frisbee, assassins etc

Christ's = all scientists, &lt;45% female

I dont have any sweeping generalisations for the others. Of course, I forgot the oft repeated maxim - I would rather go to Oxford than to Johns. 

If I could choose any College, Emma would be near the top, but it is hugely academic and probably tough to get in to. Christ's likewise, but you cant beat its location.

If you can see what your admissions tutor-guy (you have a seperate Oxbridge guy?) has written about you, it can be a huge boon, to see what you need to talk up, that they havnt. If you are academically excellent, so is everyone else. Maybe if you didnt drop a mark on your ASes you might be ahead of the pack, but only just. Extra-curricular things DO matter - especially if they are academic. Olympiads are a good idea. Maths probably MORE so than physics, since degree courses are being undermined by a lack of mathematical rigour. My year had to have an entire extra course for statistical thermodynamics because the previous year were a bunch of fuckups at exam time due to crappy teaching/courses at A level. 

Announce an intention to take AEA or STEP mathematics. Your college will probably ask for STEP anyway (I think), but if you can provide evidence of enthusiasm for extension papers, it can only help. Have a look at some papers to get an idea of what you are going for- after one year of A level maths, you should be able to make a decent stab at a few questions on the STEP I paper.

This is awful! Sarah Jane is my favorite part of the New Doctor Who series.

Why do you ask? Because she bridged the gap between the old and the new series.

Villains came back with new actors, but she is the only companion from the old guard to come back to the new series making it official canon with the old one.

The rest were just ""homage"" to the old series, like the New BSG mentioning the first Cylon war as if it was the old BSG series.

But in School Reunion, we got the first real confirmation that the new series was connected.

Plus, the Sarah Jane Adventure was amazing. Not amazing for a kids show, amazing in it's own right. Sure, a few episodes sucked and most were cheezy, but Elisabeth brought to the dynamic with the kids such a wonderful complex relationship.

I kept hoping that now that she met the 11th Doctor, in SJA, that she would show up in Doctor Who, but now, it's impossible.

true,Whittico,smith,Smith,"All of this, pretty much verbatim.  As much as the sentimental moments tug on the heart strings, it was dragged down by a lot of ridiculous or overdone moments.  Farting aliens, Daleks showing up about half of the time something goes wrong, and slightly absurd solutions to problems.

Also, most of the time, the stories never put the Doctor in much turmoil other than being sad or dying and regenerating.  It was a lot of melodrama and crazy plot strings.  Moffat wrote some stories where, even if the Doctor would come back, he could face even worse problems than dying.  I feel like sometimes Russel T. Davies just wanted to make you depressed.

Most of Moffat &amp; Co's stories put the Doctor in an emotional story as well as making you go ""OH MY GOD! WTF?!""  A lot of RTD's stories are really emotional with an added ""Oh, Doctor.  You so crazy!""

Giving credit where it's due, RTD did bring the show back on air.  So... y'know.  Yay.

EDIT: Oh, and one more thing.  Most of RTD's stories used the TARDIS and time travel as a mode of transportation, where the plot would then take place.  So far, Moffat has used Time almost as a character, manipulating the timeline, crossing it when the universe is out of whack, using the time loop when said whackness has occured (the Red Nose Day sketches and the Pandorica Opens two-parter).

Most of the blame can be put on age - in Canada most houses or apartments are from the 60s or later, but in the UK (or at least Oxbridge) a lot of grad students get put in 19th century houses.  Its not too major, but be prepared for poor insulation (cold rooms at night) and mild shower pressure.

Watching the scenes of Amy in the Tardis (TEH &amp; Lodge) seemed to be more credible than the video gives.

I've studied constitutional law to death, and there is **no way** we would have such a moderate and well developed system (copied around the world) if it wasn't for such an archaic, difficult to remove and traditional roadblock as the monarchy. Forcing democratisation and modern rights to evolve around a monarchy means we rely on convention, which produces a very robust and well-tailored form of democracy.

There are only three ways of dealing with a head of state in a democracy. Make it a inherited ceremonial role (constitutional monarchy), make it a political office separate from the head of government (parliamentary republic and presidential-parliamentary system) or combine it with the office of head of government (constitutional republic). 

Of the three constitutional monarchy is the best because it separates the head of government from the head of state. This makes the head of state a non political figure and helps prevents abuse of power by the head of government. It also allows people to criticize the head of government without being accused of being unpatriotic. 

The Parliamentary republic/Presidential-parliamentary system is flawed because it makes choosing the President a political act.

After a certain amount of time you have to stop taking claims of injustice because a system would be too bogged down, almost every plot of land was at one point owned by a feudal lord; if we did what you say we would have centuries of litigation over land.  That's why we have a statute of limitations.


As for the losing the war bit, yes under extreme circumstances the army would seize land; but after the war it would still have to pay back. There are a dozen cases during WW2 where this actually happened. In any case, there's no pressing need to steal the queen's land.

What you're arguing for is quite absurd. We can't trace back to the Norman invasion and redistrbute land according to that. It would be impsosible and laughable.

You’ll only be prosecuted if you have acted unreasonably. And reasonableness isn’t judged by the standards of behaviour at a vicar’s tea party, it’s judged by what someone in desperate circumstances would do.

So as it stands you legally could have defended yourself from the knife attacker, if it came down to it then you could have even done them some serious injury - in practice this means as long as you can explain your actions to the police afterwards 'i saw he was distracted so punched him in the face, as he fell i twisted his arm and got the knife then phoned the police' is likely to pass as 'defense' while 'i punched the little fucking in the face then kicked the cunt out of him after he was bleeding all over i grabbed the knife and started yelling WHOS THE DADDY NOW?

If I was to start a society from scratch it would clearly not have a hereditary monarchy wielding symbolic power, but as it is I can't envisage a scenario which would replace the Monarch with a Head of State which wasn't inferior to the current system.

If we have an elected Head of State, a figurehead President, this person would be political and we'd have some of the distasteful things we see in other countries- Poland, Iceland et al, which I don't like to see from a Head of State. They can have very few powers but by being elected they still feel they can justify using them from time to time and making political statements. I disagree with this.

If we had an appointed Head of State, it would still be political and perhaps worse, because reserve powers would **never** be used no matter how serious the situation; the President would just be a stooge for Parliament.

There has been a constitutional crisis in Australia which was resolved by the innate flexibility of a Monarch system, and hung parliaments in the UK (not the current one) have also been resolved in the same way. Yes, they largely just follow precedent, but its still impossible to argue that having a living breathing monarch who can make decisions impartially is not much more flexible.

In short, I support the idea of having a politically independent monarch who is neither appointed nor elected, serves for a **very** long time (The experience gained is invaluable, imo).

They can be influenced by any number of things which aren't always necessarily in our best interests (personal greed, mega-corporate lobbying, etc.) which I feel would be the same with any elected head of state.

With the Queen she has been raised to serve the people, she's been told since childhood that the monarchy is there to speak for the people, to protect the people and to represent the country with grace and dignity.

She is the guardian of the state, she represents the state, she is (essentially) the state personified. That is why the armed forces and Parliment swear allegiance to the Queen.

true,BonzoTheBoss,eng-Cheshire,Cheshire,"I think the general counter-arguement for the monarch's ""dormant powers"" is that generally they're a safeguard against political extremism. Say for example we somehow managed to vote the BNP into power and we've spawned our own version of Hitler, the Queen could see what road this new prime minister is taking us down (declaring unjust wars, ethnic segregation and genocide etc.) and dissolve parliment there and then. Yes people would be annoyed and cry foul-play, but that's her perogative to protect the country and in retrospect people would realise it was necessary. Now I admit such a scenario is (I hope) unlikely, but there it is.

The Queen is the guardian of the state, she represents the state and is (essentially) the state personified. She's been raised to speak for the people and to protect the people as that is that state's responsibility (so in my previous example they aren't *her* powers, they're the powers of the state). By swearing allegiance to the Queen they're not really ""getting down on one knee"" to some rich old woman, they're making a symbolic promise to the state and it's people.

Again, on that note, the Crown Estate doesn't really ""belong"" to the Queen in the traditional sense, it belongs to the state which she is/represents. As you put it is the goddamned 21st century, so I feel the relationship between monarch and Crown Estate has evolved. I don't think she really could just point to a random patch of land and sell it to whomever she pleased, as it's not hers to sell, it's the states.

In regards to tourism, I think ""Versaille is visited more than Buckingham, hence we should behead the Queen"" is a logical fallacy.

true,BonzoTheBoss,eng-Cheshire,Cheshire,"I think there's some confusion over the definition of the monarchy in modern abstract terms and how the institution of the monarchy has evolved. The Queen doesn't ""own"" the Crown Estate; The Queen has been raised to speak for the people, to represent the people. She's also supposed to represent the state, she is (essentially) the state personified. Hence *technically* speaking the state already owns that land.

She can't, for example, point to any random patch of land and sell it to whomever she pleases, it doesn't work like that because the Crown Estate belongs to the *institution* of the monarchy, i.e. the state. I'm sure you've already been over the figures for the cost vs. profit of the Crown Estate, so that's a moot point.

The reason why we can't just seize the land is because it doesn't really make sense. We're already earning profit from it, and we'd essentially be seizing it from ourselves (the state and people represented by the institution of the monarchy). The point justicia was making was even if you ignored all that, at the end of the day the Queen still has rights. It would be no different if you'd inherited a house from your parents and then the government came in and took it from you.

Furthermore, in this modern age I think there's a much more dangerous ""exploitative elite"" we need to sort out first; e.g. super rich bankers (who earn FAR more than the Queen does, and probably avoid taxes (which the Queen pays on her earnings)via extensive off-shore accounts), ""jobs for life"" MPs etc...",0,1303308440,null,0,false,0,c1qdfxh,t3_gub5b,t1_c1qdfxh,t1_c1qcvss,1427083474,5,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,5

The following do not reflect which episodes and specials are actually the best, some of them are kind of crap, but they will get you the background you need to be ready for the new season. I would suggest still going back and watching the rest, of course, or you'll miss out on a lot of fun. Minor spoilers may apply, but I'll try not to give away anything you don't already know or would guess quickly.

I would say that if you watch Planet of the Dead, for the prophecy, The End of Time parts 1&amp;2, to see the prophecy play out, The Eleventh Hour to meet the new Doctor, and then the season five finale two parter, The Pandorica Opens and The Big Bang to get really familiar with Rory and Amy, that should get you up to speed with minimal time invested, and you'll still be able to go back and see the rest. There will be some things you miss going that route, but I think the dialog within those episodes will fill you in on the high points of what happened in the rest. 

If you can squeeze in Flesh and Stone and The Time of Angels, that would be a good one to see, but it's not strictly necessary, just a bit more on River. If you can also manage to fit in the season finale two-parter of season 4, that will keep you from wondering what the Hell happened to Donna.

As for the reasons:

Claiming that the income from the revenues from crown land is a benefit of the royal family is nonsense: these lands are not subject to inheritance tax as they would otherwise be and to begin with, as others have pointed, this land is only 'theirs' because it was theirs by default historically. If we abolished the monarchy they would not own a good chunk of this land. Inheritance Tax has been around since ~1800. If we went and reclaimed all the back-dated inheritance tax (which is at 40%, FYI), plus the interest, I'm quite certain it would be substantially more than £200m/year.

The tourist line isn't really true; as has been pointed out below the most visited Royal Palace in Europe is Versaille. It seems to be getting along just fine in terms of tourists without having a reigning Monarch. Its an exceptionally flaky claim to make.

- The Time of Angels / Flesh and Stone
- The Vampires of Venice
- Amy's Choice
- The Hungry Earth / Cold Blood

Note that you REALLY REALLY REALLY should just watch all of Series 5 first, but these are the most important.  (Amy's Choice may be optional as well, but I have a feeling it's going to be important in Series 6, so I've included it.)  Also, I'm not sure how important ""A Christmas Carol"" - the 2010 (post-Series 5) Christmas special - will be to Series 6, so I haven't included it.

That way, you can finish all of the Specials, Series 5, and ""A Christmas Carol,"" and as a bonus you don't have to wait a week to watch Part 2 of the Series 6 premiere - you can just watch Part 1 on the same day that Part 2 airs.

Like all land on planet earth. At some point someone stole it or someone arbitrarily claimed it as theirs. It may have later been sold and then resold etc. until it got into your hands, but at some point in time that land would probably have been taken off someone else. If you want to go around returning land to whoever it was originally taken off you would have an immense and also impossible job. 

&gt; these lands are not subject to inheritance tax as they would otherwise be and to begin with

They are not and were not subject to inheritance tax by agreement. You can't just decide you want to go back and retrospectively undo all previous agreements made between entities and then retrospectively apply laws to them that didn't apply to them in the first place. Imagine if you pay 40% inheritance tax today and in 200 years the government puts it up to 80% and says it now wants your great great grandchildren to retrospectively pay the difference between 40% and 80% for every generation that land passed between. It would probably be morally indefensible and it would certainly be legally indefensible. Imagine you made an agreement with a shopkeeper last year to buy an orange for 20p but he turns up today and says he retrospectively wants 25p for it; you would laugh him off. Or that neighbour who gave you his old TV 10 years ago because he didn't want to take it to the skip turning up and demanding you now pay him for it. The examples where you could retrospectively change an original agreement 200 years later and then try and collect as if the agreement wasn't made are endless and would turn any country's law and certainly it's commerce into complete chaos and a farce. 

As for the tourist line, it's definitely debatable exactly how much value having a royal family adds to tourism but you can't really compare Versaille to Buckingham Palace or other places in the UK as the later are like garden sheds compared to the former. 

*edit*: so ""spurious at best"": no. *Debatable*: yes. Not spurious because it *is* a fact that we make money off the royals (the 40m/200m claim) and the line of reasoning *is* valid. Debatable because *when you add other factors* into the mix - i.e. your debatable claim that they don't ""really"" own the land and your debatable claim that the land would revert to the people if we abolished them and your debatable claim that we could retrospectively apply inheritance tax to their properties - there is a debate to be had.

Taxi drivers were given a three year notice to re-paint, taxi drivers were given plenty of notice, though little action was taken. Also, painted taxis are genuinely a benefit to tourists and such with regards to sham taxi firms. Par example, Dads cabs, about five years ago, would fuck you over royally, and would be one of the most dangerous firms to ride with, what with the whole not being license but still advertising. Though they themselves are licensed now, other sham firms still exist, and promote themselves with little intervention. Brighton &amp; Hove council paint their cabs white &amp; turquoise in order to prevent sham firms cropping up, with great effect.

HOWEVER

Royal blue is one of the most fucktarded ideas for a repaint ever. It's a surprisingly regular colour, and easy to sham. If you wanted a standardized colour, make it something apparent, not just a regularly picked colour.

Idea is alright, as people have less fears getting fucked over by taxis, but the BCC are still incompetent fucktards unable to make a decent decision between them. ",0,1303329044,null,0,false,0,c1qffvt,t3_gubzy,t1_c1qffvt,t3_gubzy,1427084416,5,false,bristol,t5_2r52c,5

2. Correct.

3. The F.A. Cup, is open to all teams in England that meet the requirements. Unlike the Premier League trophy (which obviously can only be won by Premier League teams) any team can win the tournament, though I don't think anyone but a Premier League (or top tier to be more general) has ever won it.

4. It is not the top 4 teams from all leagues. The Bundesliga for example, this year, is only the top 3 while Serie A has the top 4. This is changing and I believe flipping. If you qualify, you play in a Group Stage. If you don't make it out of the group stage you are then allowed to compete in the Europa League. If you make it out of the Group Stage you play 2 matches, overall aggregate score wins. Tie goes to the team with the most away goals.

5. A player is on loan when he isn't sold but is playing for another team (in the EPL). Some other leagues allow partial ownership of players but I believe this is getting phased out almost entirely.

6. Last year we played the 4-1-2-1-2 for almost the entire season and set the Premier League scoring record, 103 goals for. This year we have moved to a 4-3-3 and probably will stick with this for a while.

7. ESPN3 carries some of the programs. Otherwise you can always check out myp2p.eu on match days to try to get some live streams.

true,strawhathacker,null,null,"Yes the sovereign privilege comes from their ancestors being a bigger bunch of bastards. That is obvious to even a casual observer; so does any inheritance anyone else receives.  We all have some degree of inherited position in life - for better or worse.  

Some would argue that it would be laudable to do away with any form of inheritance whatsoever, but there is a very animal desire on the part of adults to look after and seek the best for their children.  Short of putting the children into some sort of state child pool and passing the responsibility around to random people at certain intervals I don't see how to level the playing field.  People inherit incredible wealth and power in republics too.

I'm not suggesting that the degree of inherited privilege isn't distasteful - it is, and I've struggled with my opinion on this for many years.

The conclusion I came to is that I'd rather have someone who has zero political ambition because they have everything they need as an ""independent"" (and I know that is a loaded word in this context) head of state, than one who must trade favor for power.

For what it's worth, I returned home to Canada a couple of years ago because I found living in the UK too hard due to the laws the elected representatives were passing. After 10 years I no longer wanted to live in a country where my civil liberties were being visibly eroded. All in all however, my personal preference would be that the nature of the power would be more carefully documented than is the case in the UK currently.  A bit more like Canada, really.

As to the pre-existing nature of these biases, I'd suggest you read Griffith's 1998 Politics of the Judiciary or for a briefer snapshot [read this](http://blogs.warwick.ac.uk/lucasbento/entry/a_critique_of/).

The FA Cup is pretty important, but most of the big teams won't play a full starting squad unless they are at least in the quarter-finals, but this is mainly because more of the big teams care more about winning the Premier League and Qualifying/Winning the Champions League. As for number of games played in a year... well it get's pretty convoluted. You play 38 Premier League games, if you win the Champions league you will have played 13 games (6 group, 2 in knockout round 1, 2 in quarter finals, 2 in semi finals, and 1 for final).

They did get Photoshop/Dreamweaver/Flash CS4 eventually, after much persuasion, but all of the old resources and training were for 8, so that's still used.

I completed the GCSE in my first year and then went onto teaching myself the A-Level stuff, but I just found it so mind numbingly boring that I gave up. For the most part it was just an extension of GCSE and I've gotten on better using the skills I'd taught myself before I'd even joined the school than I have from anything I learnt there..

true,Dipshit_Alert,null,null,"Sorry to hear all that. I have two practical suggestions:

&gt;I can't start a business since I have no capital.

Ten years ago when I was on the rock n roll &amp; skint I started my own business after getting a loan from the Princes Trust to buy a cheap car and a few other bits. Can you approach them / are you eligible? Frankly you sound reasonably sober &amp; like you can apply yourself: all you'll need will be a feasible idea involving a reasonably modest sum, and a credible-looking (homemade is fine) business plan. 

Disclaimer: I'm in a totally different industry, *but* I found that after setting up &amp; doing some pretty small jobs (long hours, low return), the better work shows up as people got to know about me. Can you set up as a promoter / producer in small theatres? A commercial proof reader (boring as hell, but possibly regular money... then build up contacts &amp; move onto something else on your own terms)... have a think about it. Look up the T's &amp; C's of the Princes Trust, and look for other bodies as well, I've no idea what the score is in NI but there must be some funds for new businesses. Local Authorities over here usually have some schemes for this.

Second idea is more short-term, to get some cash in your pocket: for a couple of weeks, stop fucking around with CVs, instead scrub up, haircut etc. (if necessary) and get yourself out, live and in person, uninvited, to every bloody bar and restaurant where you live asking for casual work. If you're absolutely repulsed by catering (and I wouldn't blame you) go to building firms - small companies, sole traders, tradesmen, the sort of people who won't be arsed with CV-based recruitment procedures!  If the boss is out, come back later. Smile &amp; be chatty to absolutely everybody. Butter up their missus. If the answer's ""no"", say fair enough but try to get talking long enough to find out what they know about who else might be hiring.

I did casual bar / waiter work for years, also builder's labouring etc. in several different towns, and once you've got a bit of experience you'll find it's something to fall back on when other jobs fall through. Yes it's long hours &amp; may be sub-minimum wage. But it's seriously better than being so skint you can't afford a £10 shirt, and you'll meet people. The more people you *know*, the more options you have.

I think time would be linear to the Doctor. He might constantly be time travelling in and out of alternate time lines, but relative to himself time is uninterrupted.

Obviously this theory only stands up if we factor out any aspects of time dilation due to the speeds that the Tardis travels and obviously we don't know the effects of wormholes or any other intra-universe time travel techniques, whichever the Doctor may use.

Also, at a more fundamental level, perhaps the Doctor's age isn't measured in years. For a time lord who is constantly involved in such important time-manipulative events it's unlikely he would use an arbitrary human-construct, such as years, to measure his age. It's more likely that his 'Earth' age is simply a conversion, or even a guess, to his real age relative to Earth, rather than a measure of his life span which has weaved in and out of so many alternate time lines it's probably dilated

If one angel sees another, say from the back, perhaps the second one does quantum lock, but only so long as the first is looking at it, once he looks away, the second is free to go about it's business.

It's implied in *Flesh and Stone* that the angels' defence mechanism is voluntary. That is: they don't move because they think Amy can see them. The reason the four angels become frozen in *Blink* is because it's a quantum lock: the act of observing is what causes them to become stone. If *Flesh and Stone* is correct, than the four angels from *Blink* should be able to escape because they can control their defence mechanism.

true,ScreamingGerman,null,null,"Yeah, I think he should stay. I don't think his tactics have been as poor as everyone makes it seem, he's been undermined constantly this season by Roman. The firing of Wilkins disrupted the side and caused the worst run in the EPL, ever. Seven points from nine games - if we don't win the league this year, it's down to that stretch of games. We were hit by injuries to key players (Terry, Alex, Lampard, Benayoun, Drogba) for stretches, where we lost our best defenders, only creative midfielders, and the focal point of our offense. What can you do when they all go down? Our depth in the side was lost when we cut too many fringe players and though we could rely on youth. It didn't work as planned and it further ruined us. Finally, the transfer of Torres put him in a very difficult spot. Basically forced to fit an out of form striker into his side when it was clear he didn't want the transfer. He disrupted the side further but it looks like we've settled once again.

So I think Carlo deserves another season, at the very least. Wins the Double in one season, then gets unlucky the next.

That's because they can only move in the gaps between the frames; if you think about it, there's no way that a TV could show us them moving as it only shows lots of still photos in quick succession.

Let's break this down logically

Obviously the Doctor isn't dead for good, that'd ruin the show.

Amy pregnant? Nothing bad can happen to this baby, no miscarriages or anything, it is a kids show. IF she's pregnant. This could be a diversion of some kind.

If she is pregnant and 1969 is where the baby is born, the ages add up for this to be River. I personally would find this to be quite stupid though. 

The child astronaut? Again a kids show essentially, this child will not die and that's probably why the next episode showed this so blatantly. The child looked PISSED imo, could she be more than meets the eye? 

The astronaut that shot the doctor? I don't think this was the child. I think this was River, if she saw herself kill the Doctor she would try to stop it or she would cause some paradox. The child also isn't 6 foot tall and again, River has seen the equipment that they found early in the episode, space suit ""this is so cool"". 

 Or slightly less likely it was the doctor himself. They've obviously got 2 in 1969 at that time so why not? The equipment is there, the Doctor put it on and said ""This is cool!!!"".

The guilt River's carried all this time has got to be fake. Why? Because otherwise if Matt Smith decides to do another 5 series they'll need to keep River Song around as a character to kill him. 

Alternatively she doesn't kill the Doctor and she could kill Amy or Rory. There are rumours that this is Amy Pond's last series.

I admit, I don't know much about politics and the working world, but I am just a 16 year old hoping for a bright future which is gradually getting further and further away on the horizon.

Keynesian theory states that the more you put into the economy, the more you get out of it. I see it like, if you buy an old bike the spokes and wheels are buckled. You can't ride it well. You go out and spend £40 fixing the wheels and spokes and the bike is much better.

I know I might come across as ignorant here, but it is the way forward. Raising taxes, cutting school funding and making uni seem impossible for the lower classes will degrade not only the view of the Tories in the public eye, but the economy itself.

Too many people are labelling Gordon Brown and the labour party as the people who put us into recession. Last time I remember there is a worldwide economic crash going on.

I was in the first year that grants got axed and loans became the norm, I'm now (10 years later) just about to pay it off, yet people a year older never had to worry about it. I agree that £9,000 is bloody ludicrous to pay considering what people before you had to pay, that point I'm not disagreeing with.

BUT that's not the same as it being unaffordable. You bring up how poor your family is and how they'll not be able to cope with it, but they don't have to pay it.. it's a complete non-issue in that regard. And in bringing it up you're actually weakening your argument.

Yes the fees are high, but they're not stopping you. your repayments after will be no higher than if you were only paying £3,000 in fees, yes it'll take longer, and that's shitty and unfair, but it's not a barrier.

Think of it like this, if most people in specialist jobs that require a degree have these fees to pay off, they'll be demanding more wages in order to pay them off, the economy in the long run will balance out again, if everyone in certain sectors has 5% less income because they're still paying off fees, then there's a good chance wages will end up 5% more to counter it.

true,sync0pate,uk,West Mids,"Hah, I am not to be revered, you seem to have a pretty good grasp on politics and the way the world works, much better than I did at 16.

You certainly know your Keynesian theory; if you spend £1 employing a nurse for example, that isn't a £1 lost, but it is money he or she will then go on to spend on products and services, and put back into the economy - also, if you don't spend that £1 to employ someone, what are the chances they will become a burden on the welfare state? I'd rather we pay people to provide public services than pay them to stay at home and claim benefits.

You don't come across as ignorant at all. The Tories are widening the gap between the rich and the poor, they're doing it ruthlessly and deliberately. They don't understand the value of education and they have no desire for social mobility - they're already at the top and they're keen to pull the ladder up behind them as quickly as possible.

I'm not a fan of Gordon Brown or the Labour party AT ALL, but the idea that he somehow caused the recession is ludicrous. We DON'T have a particularly high level of debt (as a proportion of GDP) and we still have a very high credit rating as a nation. The recession was a global recession caused by runaway capitalism (to be more specific caused by speculation in areas like default swaps etc, the bankers were ""inventing value"" and lending money they never had in the first place).

None of the parties are anywhere near as left wing as they used to be, the left in this country has nowhere to go.

We need to realise that the current political and capitalist system is not going to fix itself, it's working fine for the people in charge and they're not going to change anything.

true,pikeybastard,null,null,"Hey dude, I understand some of your concerns. I was brought up in a council house in Medway, single mum on benefits scraping money together as my dad left her with a load of debt. I still remember as a kid not having carpets, most furniture, a tv and telephone or shit like that. For a while my mum was skipping meals every other day too to make ends meet. But you will be alright if you keep studying hard, even with the increased tuition fees, it is feasible, but it isn't fair, but there are lots of reasons why it is happening (most of them stupid). Seriously though, keep working hard. I went to a shit school and had no money but thru hard work I'm doing politics at cambridge and the debt is gonna hurt but is *is* manageable and it will pay for itself.

Until looking more into the issue I was on the bandwagon (and it is mostly a bandwagon) about hating the Tories/Lib Dems over this, but it genuinely isn't that simple. The rise in tuition fees is a direct result of the last government wanting to raise student levels to an unsustainable number, and the government not being able to afford to support such a huge investment in higher education.

In 2009 Gordon Brown and Peter Mandelson commissioned the Browne Review from Lord Browne, a former BP big-wig, in order to find a way to make university funding more sustainable. In their manifesto (written by Ed Milliband chiefly) and electoral campaign, they argued that they would await the outcome of this report and implement its findings. Peter Mandelson was particularly vociferous in its support, as was David Milliband, and Ed Milliband, although after the election changing his mind after seeing how unpopular the review was and supporting the original Lib Dem idea of a graduate tax, tacitly supported it in his crafting of the Labour 2010 manifesto and helping convince the P. Labour Party of the reviews necessity. The tories before the election also said that they would await the review's recommendations, and have subsequently implemented it. The lib dems were the only party to distance themselves from it, however the nature of coalitions is compromise and they surrendered on this issue gambling on the backlash being against the tories, as they had bigger fish to fry (e.g getting a referendum on AV). So in fact if Labour had won the last election, they too would have raised tuition fees. The benefit of opposition is being able to change tack and oppose unpopular policies such as this one.

As for the cuts, the idea that the Tories are cutting for 'ideological' reasons is in most scenarios absurd; for example, no political party would willingly make itself this unpopular for an abstract definition of ideology- nobody is debating what this ideology may be- the implication is a smaller state, but in actuality not all tory ideology is for a reduction in the state. One nation conservatism, for example, is considered a 'modern-liberal' approach, and espouses investment in certain public sectors which improve social justice or a more efficient ways of delivering positive results than the free market. Indeed, the whole *point* of conservatism as a rule- although, as the 80's neoliberalism showed, not an absolute- is that it is meant to be practical over ideological.

There are cuts that are being badly administered, however overall the cuts are an unfortunate result of a huge deficit, expensive sovereign debt and pressures on things such as the currency. For example, we could shout til the cows come home about how bad it is that money isn't being spent on certain things, but the money has to come from somewhere. If the UK doesn't pay off a certain amount of its debt atm then sovereign wealth funds won't lend to the government, so no money from there. Investors don't buy uk gilts (another way of borrowing money from the private sector), as they don't expect to get their money back. The take from tax now is going to be the lowest in a generation due to the high level of unemployment and the highest levels of P/T work in UK history. So the money in many cases isn't there in the first place- or if it is, it is more expensive debt. Bearing in mind the UK's debt repayments are currently, due to confidence in the UK's willingness to pay off the deficit, are amongst the cheapest in interest % of anywhere in the world, yet debt repayments this year will be several factors higher than education spending, uni spending, or indeed anything bar social security and the NHS, it starts to become clearer why cuts are being implemented, and why the Lib Dems are not being more vocal against them- the luxury Labour have at the moment is *not* being in government. If you look at Europe, the countries with the biggest deficits as a % of GDP (which includes the UK) are Greece, Ireland, Portugal, etc etc, all of which are having huge cuts enforced on them by eurozone neighbours in exchange for lending them money, to keep the euro viable. The thing is, the UK isn't in a currency union, and is too big to be bailed out, so it has to cut it's way out of debt *unless* there is an unexpected global boom for example. Unfortunately printing money would just devalue the currency and create massive inflation.

From a family who were traditionally a mining family and all card carrying Labour members it's been hard for me to turn against them, and it is important to add the caveat that by disliking Labour it *doesn't* make me a true blue tory or die hard Lib Dem, but New Labour were economically devastating. It is important to consider these points in considering the fact:

They deregulated finance more than any other government in UK history- even more than Thatcher, although she did allow building socs. to become banks

When they came into office the economy had seen record growth and had the biggest budget surplus in UK history

In the biggest global boom in history they didn't save, invest or strengthen the UK's economic structures, making us the first country into and last country out of recession in Europe- a critical mistake, as in a boom you *always* save and invest capital in specific areas and funds, like China and Brazil have. Unfortunately brown thought that he'd eradicated boom and bust, so spent.

The national debt is even bigger when you consider Private Finance Initiatives- billions of pounds waiting to be paid off.

The economy was overloaded in the private sector- this is one reason why the cuts are being felt so strongly, in that so many people are employed by government- these are not jobs that bring much wealth *into* an economy, and are ones more reliant on the economic good times.

As chancellor and then PM Brown was the only economic leader from the big 5 economies that was there throughout the disastrous build up of a badly controlled global financial sector and badly undercapitalised banking and government reserves.

Also, much of the apparent boom was actually down to a trade deficit with countries like China, who built VERY cheap goods for the euro/us market creating the illusion of wealth, a position that will gradually change as the east catches up with the west economically per capita.

As for the banks, they are scumbags, absolutely, particular the 'masters of the universe' cowboys who generated a banking bubble for the purposes of pure greed. However, people should not completely absolve themselves of all responsibility- part of the problem was people borrowing money they could not afford for stuff they didn't need, and not paying it all back. of course the banks should never have lent to them, but people also do have their own agency to make decisions.

oh my god, longest post in reddit history! anyway dude, the gist of my argument is that it is too simplistic to just go ""boo, tories bad, all their fault""- it is probably the worst time to come into government in 31 years at the moment, if not longer, and as for tuition fees, students were screwed over a long time before now, and it has been by all 3 political parties and their power games. you will be ok though, as long as you make sure you get a good degree from a good uni- don't do something like david beckham studies at the university of bumfluff, as then the debt won't be worth it. you sound motivated though, and tbh most of school and after isn't down to the school so much as your own abilities and motivation.

anywhoo, hope this hasn't been too boring to read, preparing for mass downvotes as this is an issue a lot of people feel very strongly about :p just my tuppence worth tho.

The only way to make people think twice about going to University only to wind up working in a shop is if people have to stump up for it and the only fair way to not close the door on poorer people is to make it debt that can be delayed in being paid back till you earn money. Labour made a huge mistake in making University available to everyone for dirt cheap.

Newsflash: We can't all go to University. Society doesn't work like that. We need people to work in shops, we need people to sweep the streets. 

I realise this is opening a can of worms on Reddit which is primarily in the University age bracket but I've been there, I went through University to get an animal biology degree and I am one of about 5 people in my year of around 100 who has actually gone on to use my degree. 

The Scottish government has footed the bill of each and everyone one of us on that course, I am only £2,000 in debt for my loans so fuck knows what it's cost the government directly to send me to University. I can at least stand proud and say that I'm using my knowledge in a job, my classmates should have thought twice about going to University.

I used to be quite ideological until a couple of years ago- when you look in more detail at the roots of ideology, naturally you see their flaws I suppose. I used to think that ideology somehow imbued something with moral authority, however someone made the counter-point to me which was that if your ideology turns out to be in some modes destructive for some people, and your decision making processes are led by prescriptive thinking rather than dealing with the situation as it is and using the best models available, and people suffer, is that really more moral? It was a depressing thought :( so I don't know what is the best ideology myself, though lots of people would make good arguments for many. The only thing I feel passionately about with politics now is labels- I hate it when people use shorthand like left and right wing, labour and tories etc, instead of actually thinking about the actual causes of events. Most of them are meaningless or misinterpreted anyway, or so open to debate that no-one can argue from the same page. I just figure it doesn't help anyone. Then again I'm only a 2nd year undergrad, so I know bugger all :p

Hey, good luck with the politics A level- it is a great one to do. If you read the newspapers every day, in particular the comments section, and the book *who runs this place* about the UK constitution, you'll ace it- it is really easy if you just keep up with current affairs :p

River could have killed the doctor in the future which she could be in jail for in her past providing that she travels in time to do so and her past self is caught for the crime and she knows that she does what she is going to do. it could also be why she doesn't ever like to mention who she killed because she hasn't done it yet and its the doctor.

I don't think the doctor kills himself I think he had to die to get everybody together to go to 69 because maybe the group would not have gone if they didn't think they had something to lose? Especially as it's his past self he had to trick as well as Rory/Amy and River.

So here is my take on the Silence, connection to the fake TARDIS and the like. I am thinking the Silence or creatures are human/TARDIS hybrids. Now hear me out. So, remember how TARDIS are not made, but grown. They are by many definitions alive. We also have the chameleon ability of the TARDIS, which relates as to why they wear suits. TARDIS also have latent psychic abilities, hence why people keep on forgetting that they are there.

Now think about a scenario where someone is trying to build/copy Time Lord technology. Biological experimentation is not out of the question. Especially with all the surgical equipment lying around. We know someone has been building the mechanical portions of the TARDIS, and the new creatures we are seeing are a human/TARDIS hybrid that may have been driven mad by experimentation or abandonment as the facility got shut down.",0,1303608224,null,0,false,0,c1qorun,t3_gvtsq,t1_c1qorun,t1_c1qn2pb,1427088880,9,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,9

We know that the new villains are called ""The Silence"". Perhaps this calls back to Silence in the Library. The first appearance of River Song, in a modernish space suit. Which was written by Steven Moffat. 

Perhaps the whole concept here is that the Vashta Narada are responsible for River's death in that episode, but The Silence was in some way at work within the Library. Simply we, the viewers, and The Doctor do not remember it because if we had seen them, we would forget upon looking away. This ties the Silence to The Doctor's first meeting with River, and to her death.

Moffat is known for writing meta scripts, and weaving the viewers into the experience, such as with everything involving the Weeping Angels. So perhaps his way of reasoning The Silence being at work throughout the series is via this mechanic that is written into the script.  

Another theory I have is that River was sentenced to imprisonment within a Storm Cage because the ""Important Person"" she killed was not the Doctor, but the person who was supposed to kill the Doctor. Which in turn develops a mistrust between them, in that she saves his life but also creates a paradox. For the Universe to persist as normal, it would seem that The Doctor needs to die at that point. Yet, for the series to go on, he must live. His murderer is a very big deal cosmically. Murdering him creates the paradox, which causes the cracks in time, The Silence, and perhaps even ripples throughout time with endless repercussions.",0,1303609279,null,0,false,0,c1qoufp,t3_gvtsq,t1_c1qoufp,t3_gvtsq,1427088914,36,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,36

I would also say there is an important value in learning for learning's sake. University in this light becomes something of a luxury, but it is absolutely an option that we should have open to those who are academically deserving. Taxes don't only fund necessities - sports are subsidised, the arts are subsidised, and so too should be further education. It doesn't matter that not everyone wants to go to university - not everyone wants to use a new leisure centre but it doesn't mean it shouldn't be built.

Now, where we come into agreement is that there are currently too many people in university education. We can't afford it financially or as a society. As you rightly say, we need people to sweep the streets, and who is going to be willing to do that when they have a degree? I would say though that the problem we've got in Scotland is less about a lack of fees and more about mass delusion regarding our own academic abilities. After all, fees in England don't seem to have impacted the huge upward trend in people going on to tertiary education. It's not unreasonable for unsustainable numbers of people to feel entitled to go to uni when the high school exam system that hands out ""A""s for turning up has us all convinced we're destined for a life of academia. Who is going to accept menial work over further education when they're told by their teachers that they're oh so clever?

About the death scene:

* The Silent is there to witness it.

* His friends are there to witness it.

* FBI guy is there to witness it.

* You must not interfere.

* We know [Gaiman episode has ""Fear me, I have killed hundreds of time lords."" - ""Fear me, I killed all of them.""](/spoiler)

* We know [Cybermen and badass references to Revenge Of The Cybermen and Cybermat are in coming episodes](/spoiler)

* River shoots the lake astronaut and it has no effect

* lake astronaut apparently can survive for long periods at bottom of the lake (Note: this may just be the entrance to their underground connected networks as it seems to center around these tunnels are in DC and area 51 and alien stuff.. so could just be The Silent are tied up in Roswell/Area 51 lore, hence shooting in US in 1969.  Also, their appearance, and abduction stories)


The astronaut that kills Doctor with big green blast is a cyberman.  Some bad ass evil-guy main character dude of upcoming episodes has to witness it because he is a killer of Time Lords or some timelord lore.  I think it's too much a parallel to previous Master stories.  I think the Silent are workers for this evil bad guy / Cybergeneral.  Also the Silent wear hilarious MIB outfits.

Frankly? The more I see their effect bite, the faster I slide from disgruntled acceptance to outright disgust. 

Cuts need making- nobody worth listening to's insane enough to suggest otherwise. That said, only the most parrot-like of partisans would accept that the aim of a great many of the cuts is anything but ideologically driven- it's not so much a matter of ""dragging the country out of the hole"", so much as ""restructuring the economy to suit free market, neo-Thatcherite dogma"". Yes- a good many of the Government's actions are genuinely necessary. Their handling of the tuition fees fiasco, however? Their lacklustre progress on Green issues? Pawning off the forests? One can't help but wonder what the Conservative Research Department's doing. 

What infuriates me further's Labour's utter lack of substance in opposition. Miliband's tepid vacillating doesn't inspire confidence in me that the Tories will be ejected at the earliest possible opportunity- nor has his party fundamentally changed itself from the Brown years in terms of approach.

The Lib Dems' position is entirely understandable- the party's getting a decent amount of good done in this Government, and there wasn't really much of an alternative on offer- even if the amount of pull the party seems to have exhibited in Government hasn't been quite to the degree some would prefer.

For all of the ""looking off camera"" stuff they showed, the character was actually reacting to something off camera that was relevant to that episode's plot, or the expression on their face was ambiguous at best.  I mean, people poured over these episodes last year looking for hidden information, and none of these expressions were thought of as odd at the time.  *Nobody* said ""it seems like he's looking at something"" during those episodes when they aired.

The only one that isn't blatant misinterpretation of facial expressions is the sarcophagus one, and even then, there's no reason to suspect it's anything more than a production error.  If Moffat intended it to be a subtle clue of things to come, he'd have other small indicators, too.  For instance, the Doctor's reappearing jacket in Flesh and Stone could easily have been a production error.  However, combine that with the fact the conversation he had with Amy didn't quite fit the surrounding events, and that the cryptic advice he gave her that was never explained in that episode, and it looks less like a production error and more like a clue.  

I'd *love* to have some clues hidden in season 5.  Show me a strange expression *combined* with a shadowy figure in the direction they looked, maybe I'll entertain the notion.

The other thing is that they really require you to maintain a good ratio. Often to help out newbies they'll have freeleech files so you can build up your ratio. However, some of the more exclusive sites (but usually 0-day trackers or with a strong userbase and more quality files) won't have this option, so you really got to be careful.

He was in town with the clear reason for going to the picnic, I mean, he was literally in town. At the exact time. With the opened envelope. Why would he miss the meeting? Maybe he didn't. Maybe he was supposed to show up in the suit. Or he just decided to show up in the suit so the others didn't know he killed... himself. That's why the other Doctor (11(II), if you will) said ""I know it's you."" And it kind of looks like 11(II) is showing 11 how to shoot him.

true,crazylilting,welsh,Wales,"I don't think the cuts go deep enough.  I was talking to one of my friends the other day who illustrated just how bad government waste was.  He works in a local park.  They rented a JCB about 6 years ago and it has sit in a field some where in the park, without being used and they have been paying for the weekly rental fee on it all this time.  No one has ever asked about it, they just keep paying for it.  

Another example is a car park that stays lit 24/7 7 days a week yet it closes down at 6 every day.  It came to the attendants attention that a van has been parked there for several years without being moved once.  He was told that it is being rented in case it is needed.  

I bet there are millions of stories that are similar to these one's that would add up to billions of wasted pounds if we started a thread on government waste.  

Why is it possible for such things?  Well for one annual budgets are based on the previous years spending.  If you don't spend all of your budget you won't get the same money the next year so people spend money on the craziest things just to keep the same amount of money coming in.  

The other thing is that there just seems to be to much money to watch the small things.  

I think the cuts need to be so hard that all waste is illiminated.  It is hard to have respect for the public sector when there is so much waste, layers of management, red tape, and apathy with regards to our hard earned money.  

As far as paying for education, it baffles me how people could see that it is their right to free further education.  It's gotten so bad that universities were offering completely crap courses that get no one anywhere and we as tax payers paying for the lot.  If you want a university education, why not pay for it?  Where in the world do you think you could go that you wouldn't have to pay for it?

It's mechanism of appointment for the large part allows people with experience in real fields to make decisions without fear of repercussion from the electorate, who sometimes do not know what's the best course of action and vote against their own interest. What would be the alternative to the HoL? An elected second chamber? 

The House of Lords has consistently proven itself to work in the interest of the majority and to be a strong check on the power of the government - during the Thatcher era it wasn't Labour that checked the Conservatives power, it was the Lords.

Yes, they can all be explained away by the events in the episode, but I think that adds to the beauty of it. Moffat may have hidden the Silence right in plain sight, and none of us noticed them. We noticed the character's reactions, but we subconsciously convinced ourselves that it wasn't important. As soon as the camera turned away, we forgot. Sound familiar? It's so deliciously meta that it's exactly the kind of thing he'd do.

The shadowy figures in The Big Bang could be a production error, but it doesn't really make any sense. TV shows have people whose entire job it is to watch out for things like that in the periphery. It would have been noticed, and it would have been edited out. And frankly, there was no reason for that to be there in the first place. It's not like it's a natural part of the set.

The large amount of debt you'll be in isn't actually a massive problem. A small proportion will be deducted each month from your paycheck when you earn enough to afford it. This is just like another tax and once it's going out of your bank account you just use what's left as you would with income/council tax. It won't be a massive drain on your earnings.

It is not necessary to go to University. One of the major problems with our education system is that possible career options and possibilities without Uni are not discussed with school leavers.

University towns and cities often have there own little economy running from the students. Part time work for students is not hard to find since it's being offered by the businesses that support the student population. It's quite insulated from the general, skilled job market and you won't struggle to find part time work if you make an effort.

The price is high but then all that should mean to you is that you have to honestly ask yourself do you truely want/need a University education? If yes then do it. Stop getting hot under the collar about issues that really shouldn't matter to whether or not you want to attend. Yes it's unfair and yes the system sucks but in many cases if you do not play the system and abstain from your disagreements with its mechanisms the only person to lose out will be you.

The real issue with the price tag is not your debt or whether it will stop (which it shouldn't) people who want to go to University, it's that to try and plug holes in the national debt, the Government is going to  loan triple the amount it was on loans it cannot possibly expect to see even the slightest return on for decades. I think the anti-fees movement would have been much more successful if they'd championed that rather than moaning about spending money on something which in all honesty it is not outlandish for you to required to pay for, and done in such a way that with peanuts in the family coffers you can still go and not have to give a care to how you'll pay it back, or even if you will.",0,1303651818,null,0,false,0,c1qqu9d,t3_gvv92,t1_c1qqu9d,t1_c1qnlk4,1427089853,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

It is odd though that there would be a fake TARDIS on the roof of a house in 2010, when there was one buried in a tunnel system in the U.S. in 1969.

Now the fake TARDIS was searching for a pilot. I don't think that would necessarily be true here, or else when River touched the round button on the coffin panel, it would have activated it. But then again, as seen in Forest of the Dead, River is not as complex of a time entity as the Doctor.

Anyway, so the space man. The older Doctor willingly gives his life and is murdered by whoever or whatever is in the space suit. And he has his body destroyed so, presumibly, the Silence cannot use his corpse to power their fake TARDIS. And that's all and fine. Good sacrifice by the Doctor. But why have River, Rory, and Amy there? The only purpose they could serve is to tell young doctor and create a paradox. 

The paradox will be wibbly wobbly timey wimey and I'm sure will be wrapped up with a nice shiney bow.

I wonder though, do the Silence have time travel capabilities yet? You would think they do, since they were on Starship UK.",0,1303653548,null,0,false,0,c1qqwuq,t3_gvtsq,t1_c1qqwuq,t3_gvtsq,1427089888,3,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,3

If you want an education, fine, but now that you have to pay for it maybe you'll educate yourself appropriately for the job market.  Having someone pay for a useless education doesn't do our country any good at all.  If there are shortages of educated people you will find that bursaries and scholarships will be available because industry has a vested interest in people educating themselves.  

If there is no need for such education it will become extinct.  Just propping up universities with tax dollars does not create a well educated population.  Far to many people have gone through the educational system with no hope of meaningful employment.  You simply wouldn't see this in North America.  People plan their futures and choose their education based on the hope of gainful and meaningful employment.  There would be no use to go to university if it wasn't going to lead to a brighter future, and that is the point!

The way the universities were heading they may as well not of been called universities by most accounts.  The watered down curriculum's are undermining the very reason people go to university.  The simple fact should be that not everyone is suited to University, not everyone is smart enough, the degrees earned should mean something.

And education is not free in Scotland, the government is going to pay the fees to make it look like it is free just as they are doing in wales.  That will come at a price for wales and Scotland and it is their choice and it will affect the rest of their budgets, but when they start screaming of hard times because of cut backs they won't have any recourse as it was their decision to throw money away. 

Proof that it is not free there is that if someone from England went to Scotland or wales they would still have to pay.

true,ShamBodeyHi,ni,Northern Ireland,"Sorry, but nothing has changed.  University has not become unaffordable and I'm sick of people moaning and whinging about it.  Like a commenter has said in this thread previously, University is a privilege and not a right.  However, I would support raising fees on practically useless degrees like Arts etc. and using it to subsidise those practical degrees that benefit society like Medicine, Science, Engineering or Law like you're wanting to do.

If people took the time to do some actual research on the subject, they'd figure this stuff out but no-one really cares about the raised fees.  It's just another crutch which they can use to beat the Tories with.  Those student protests?  Not a single one of those thousands of students could be bothered to take the time do do even a minutes worth of research into it, and I can tell you haven't either.  Not trying to have a go, but it really pisses me off.

Here are the stone cold facts.

You only start paying back your student loan when you start earning over £15,000.  The amount you pay back is 9% of any income over the £15,000.  So say got a job where you earned £20,000 in a year.  In that year, you will be earning £1666 per month.  Of that £1666 wage, you will only be paying back out of £416 of that money.  9% of £416 is £37 pounds.

So out of £1666 per month, £37 of it goes to pay off your student loan.  And people are deadly serious when they use the argument that they cannot afford to pay back these increased fees?  £37 a month is pretty damn cheap for an investment in your future.

And again, not only will you be paying back £37 per month, but say your entire loan for your University education was £40,000 in total.

true,bowling4meth,english,Straight out of Surrey,"Ok, I'll part enlighten you. To fully save you the trouble of using google to read up on basic economic theory would require more text than the comment box allows, and to be honest economic theory is that dull you'd probably slip into a coma before finishing it.

The increasing retirement age is a product of several things. Firstly, the retirement pot in the public sector (for public sector employees) has historically been funded by current revenues rather than sovereign wealth funds or the type of things you'd expect people to do, like put money away in a pension. The general state pension is also funded through current state income rather than any kind of fund. Secondly, a large glut of births around the mid-20th century was followed by a drop in birth rate. Those people born around that time (of which I include myself) are reaching retirement age now. Their state and civil servant pensions will add to the already large payout and put further strain on the system. Thirdly, life expectancy has significantly increased in the past 30 years or so. Whereas when you retired at 65 you'd be lucky to live 5-10 years, now it's not uncommon to hit your 80s. All of this together means that a lot of people are going to get payouts from the state (funded by current income) for a lot longer than previously expected. I heard the other day that apparently 1 in 4 13 year olds should expect to live to 100. Sadly I won't be around to fact check but it wouldn't surprise me. The resulting economic burden is huge and dwarfs our defecits (when pension obligations aren't taken into account, which they aren't always as they're seen as deferred obligations).

Next up, the government spends more now than at any point in history. In fact, public sector spending accounted for [53% of UK GDP](http://www.thisismoney.co.uk/news/article.html?in_article_id=501576&amp;in_page_id=2) in 2010. There's many reasons for it but the bottom line is that economically speaking it's extremely unhealthy. Now of course there are things in life more important than economics, but all of these things have to be paid for, and I think you know who's going to pay for them (i.e. you and me). The only way we're going to reduce this is to reduce the associated costs, but as the private sector has become quite dependent on all that state cash it's going to be difficult to untangle.

There's also the borrowing aspect to consider. Our payment rates will go up under certain circumstances and are not sustainable.

By way of a tl;dr - successive governments have spent money they didn't have on things they shouldn't have spent it on, now you're on the hook for it. Is it fair? Some might say no. On the other hand, we voted for them, so you could say we've got what we wanted.",0,1303670006,null,0,false,0,c1qrz1f,t3_gvv92,t1_c1qrz1f,t1_c1qqilc,1427090387,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

BBC America *does not* cut anything from *Doctor Who* episodes **on their first airing**.  They add commercials, yes - often at inopportune times.  But they don't cut anything.

That is, the *first* time they're aired.  Any time they're aired after that, they most certainly *do* cut things out to add more commercials ... *if they need to*.

The thing is, in the US, hour-long programs are 40-42 minutes long without commercials.  That's usually how long an episode of *Doctor Who* is nowadays.  *The Impossible Astronaut* was 43:36.  So for some episodes, they don't have to cut anything out at all, since they have their 15-20 minutes' worth of commercial time.

Just don't assume that they cut things out just because they air them with commercials.

true,crazylilting,welsh,Wales,"&gt;Well it's generally accepted that we have a right to education, you're just choosing to have a cut off point after high school that seems kind of arbitrary. Why should we be entitled to primary or secondary education either?

I don't think it's arbitrary at all.  We are responsible for kids up to 16.  Anything beyond that should be seen as a privilege that tax payers are giving to you, not the government.  I actually think we should be responsible for people's education until they are 18, much like north america.  However it seems kids just don't understand the privilege they are being given to further their education in colleges and (6th form?)

The idea of entitlement is also getting a bit tiring.  It is true we all pay taxes, but we don't even collect enough taxes to pay for the things people seemed to think they are entitled to.

I equally think education is important.  But at this juncture in history it needs a real shaking up.  Kids in colleges are not there because they are hoping to get a qualification, they are there because they have to be for the most part, ask any college teacher and you will find that they have to dragged these children through the qualifications without them learning very much at all.  They are there to get their EMA and to kill some time.  

I would agree that the biggest resource the UK has is human beings and we should be investing in that resource heavily.  But a plan needs to be put in place that puts this human resource to use to make a strong Britain.  Education and industry need to work in tandem and plans need to be made that put our nation in a direction that will turn us around.  

The system as you call it does not work, we are going further into debt, loosing key industries that support our economy and looking for the Government to some how bail us out of our misery.  

We have very high taxes when we include all the stealth taxes and it all seems to go into this black hole that does not support us as a nation.

&gt;n fact, public sector spending accounted for 53% of UK GDP in 2010. There's many reasons for it but the bottom line is that economically speaking it's extremely unhealthy.

Not necessarily, the government can provide employment, and investment in work that otherwise might not be profitable - like improving transport infrastructure. So it's not necessarily bad in and of itself, the government can act like any other employer, as a kind of public capitalist.

&gt; but all of these things have to be paid for, and I think you know who's going to pay for them (i.e. you and me). 

But there are other sources of income - for example increasing taxation and government investment and ownership of industries. Of course, all of this takes time, but so do the cuts - the higher education cuts will cost us more in the short-term, and no doubt the NHS reorganisation and Free Schools programme will too.

&gt;There's also the borrowing aspect to consider. Our payment rates will go up under certain circumstances and are not sustainable.

This is a problem, but we can avoid borrowing by increasing taxation and nationalisation. Fundamentally, we have the resources, as a society, to fund healthcare and education, and I don't see why we should sacrifice these vital services when the banks are still declaring record profits. When real people face real losses of life and opportunity, as a developed nation fails to fund even the most basic services in society, more drastic measures should certainly be considered.

It is more complicated than the simple household view of looking at the expenses and debt, and I certainly consider healthcare and education too high prices to pay.",0,1303670806,null,0,false,0,c1qs14d,t3_gvv92,t1_c1qs14d,t1_c1qrz1f,1427090416,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

Romana knew his age because she looked him up on Galifrey and when he stated he was 750ish, her immediate response was ""You've lost count somewhere."" Five and Six gave their ages as 900 and Seven used his age, supposedly 953, to open a keycode lock set by the Rani who was supposed to be the dame age as the Doctor. But that would be Galifreyan years since the Rani wasn't a fan of humans so I doubt she used her age in earth years as a combination, so his 4th incarnation was approx 750-800 Galifreyan years old and his 5th-6th incarnations were 900ish, meaning Six was short-lived which makes some sense and with the exception of the two times I mentioned, every other time he gives his age in the classic and new series, he gives it to humans who probably can't even grasp what it means to live centuries, let alone millennia, so he fudges it or gives a number that sounds good. 

*whew* 

So, yeah, your theory holds water, now there's no Gallifrey and no one has records on how old the Doctor is or how long he has been travelling, so he probably keeps a vague reckoning in earth years, and if you accept as canon  the story where 8 spends 600 years imprisoned then yeah, 9 was probably around 900 in Earth years and 10 was probably just keeping the numbers down to keep his companions from saying ""Oy! You said you were going to pop to the loo and now you're 940?""

true,AgentConundrum,null,null,"&gt; To be fair, there are characters and plots going on that require a lot of background understanding to make sense of.

Also to be fair, this was the *sixth season* opener. If someone walked into Lost at the start of its sixth season, would you say that it's the shows fault that they didn't know what was going on? How about Star Trek: TNG which opened each of its last four seasons with cliffhanger resolutions? Can a new viewer just jump in there and instantly know eveything that's happening?

My point is that the sixth season of *any show* has the right to be ""too much, too fast"" for new viewers. You can't coddle people forever. New Whovians already have plenty of jumping on points, including the beginning of the *last season* which was so much of a jumping off point that it was effectively a whole new show.

I, for one, loved The Impossible Astronaut particularly *because* it was a bit complex and left you scratching your head. I just asked my girlfriend what she thought of it, and if it was too complex, and she didn't have a problem with it.

I remember trying to watch the original Doctor Who, starting with Hartnell, and being annoyed with how slow and dry it was. Someone in this subreddit explained the problem perfectly - it was filmed in a time when there weren't reruns or VCRs or DVD box sets.

true,keito,null,null,"The Tories cut spending to vital services and education which will mostly effect the poorest in society.  We need to save money and reduce the deficit sure, no-one is arguing that, but the Tories are disingenuous.  They fail to implement policies which could reduce the deficit massively, if it effects their blue-blooded Eton brethren.  The rich will barely feel the effects of such recessionary cuts.  That is the bottom line here.

At the end of the day though spending cuts are not the main ingredient to putting an end to the recession. https://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/06/opinion/06krugman.html?ref=homepage

It was wartime deficit spending that eventually saw the end of the Great Depression. Cuts have never done anything historically other than prolong the agony.

It's times like this when we need to cut back on defence/military expenditure, hike taxes on the top 25% earners, clamp down on tax evasion by the uber-rich (we lose £18.5 billion a year to tax evasion), limit banker bonuses, as well as a slew of other measures to regenerate our economy. In reality the conservatives plans do little to actually fix the economy.

Cuts have a knock-on effect, as does the opposite; Spending stimulates the economy. If people have no expendable cash then money doesn't flow through the system (let's call it a 'trickle through effect').  Most people with expendable cash spend it, which actuals helps the economy.  It's really quite simple at the lower level.

There are many ways to cut spending without doing the damage that the Tories continue to inflict upon the nation.  According to Mark Thomas in *The Peoples Manifesto*:

""MP's should not be paid wages but loans, like students, because they get highly paid jobs after they graduate from Westminster as a result of attending parliament. They therefore pay back the loan they received while in office""

I happen to think that's a great idea. Most MP's have a second job anyway. Take Ann Widdecombe, MP for Maidstone. As well as being an MP, she writes for the Daily Express (urgh!), does numerous speaking engagements, etc. She earned £244,000 in one year alone!... ***Yet, she only managed to turn up and vote on less than half the votes held.*** George Galloway only managed to turn up to a mere 8%, yet earned £229,000.

Politics. Whoever tells you it isn't broken is not paying attention, or benefits somehow from the broken system.

I think this is people convincing themselves those expressions *don't* fit, not the other way around.

Here's another argument;  When people see the Silence, they get pretty freaked out.  Amy doesn't look *perplexed* in the bathroom, she looks 
*terrified.*  What's more, people didn't usually look away from the Silents for no reason.  When they broke their gaze, it was usually to run, or tell someone else about this creepy fucking alien.  In none of those clips did someone have a plausible reason to look away when they did.  In some of them, their strange expression faded *before* they looked away.  

I think a decent rule of thumb is, if a character's facial expression has a readily available explanation that *isn't* a Silent, you shouldn't assume a Silent is the cause. (Barring other evidence)

Now, I'm not saying the Silents don't appear in season 5 at all, just that it didn't happen in any of those clips.",0,1303679329,null,0,false,0,c1qsoeo,t3_gvtsq,t1_c1qsoeo,t1_c1qqtzc,1427090786,2,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,2

The Queen is a non-executive head of state. If the monarchy were abolished it wouldn't necessarily lead to a president holding the roles of Prime Minister and monarch.

true,GrimSophisticate,smith,Smith,"I've seen these floating around for a while (and I wanted to procrastinate on some homework), so here's my opinions:

&gt;The Eleventh Hour -

While hanging from the TARDIS, the Doctor looks up into it and for a couple of seconds has a confused look on his face.

Okay, this is there. I had always figured it was a ""how did I get out here?"" type of thing, but I'll let it slide.

&gt;When Rory and Amy exit the elevator on the second floor of the hospital, Rory glances behind him at something, but when he looks back towards Amy, he shakes his head like he forgot something. It is about 42:49.

I think he's just supposed to be disoriented after getting out of the elevator, but okay.

&gt;In the scene at the end of the episode where Amy goes into the TARDIS for the first time. there’s one point where she leans back on the console and is looking around the room. The camera is pointed towards her face, so we can’t see what she’s looking at. She looks around with a sort of awe-struck smile, but then her eyes linger over something and her expression turns into a look of horror. 

This also happens right after the ""Can you get me back for tomorrow?"" conversation, so I'm putting this one down to ""I'm running off with a strange man I haven't seen in years the night before my wedding.""

&gt;The Beast Below - At around 9:25 a black figure walks past Amy, she looks confused/scared for a couple of seconds then shrugs it off.

Okay, now this one made me raise an eyebrow. It's that same sort of weird ""organic"" sound cue and everything.

&gt; Victory of the Daleks - Near the end after the Daleks escape, the Doctor moves slowly backwards, as he gets near to the green framed window/doorway he looks to his left with a shock.

Not buying it. I'm pretty sure the Doctor's realizing the Daleks have beat him again, and Amy and Churchill are shocked that he looks like he's about to collapse.

&gt;The Lodger - At 21:47 for a couple of shots Amy looks in the distance or at the screen and gasps, then shouts for the Doctor’s attention but he doesn’t listen. She looks away and shakes it off.

This is another one I'm ready to brush off. Amy's reacting to the Doctor hanging up on her after commenting she could've been killed moments ago.

&gt;Vampires of Venice - At the end when Rory, Amy, and the Doctor are standing by the TARDIS, the TARDIS door is open and then shuts on it’s own.

This is actually pretty interesting. I'm not sure if the Doctor's opening it, then shutting it to make sure he sees Amy and Rory's conversation, or if he's standing behind Amy and not noticing the door opening and shutting. I'll give this one a maybe.

&gt;The Big Bang - There are cloaked figures behind the Sarcophagi in the museum; a third figure moves out of shot at the edge of the screen at about 13:31

I've seen screens of this one a lot, and it's another one I think could be legit.

The one I'm really surprised no one's commented on is 15:53 in The Eleventh Hour - when the shadowy figure runs by the camera inside Amy's house before the jump forward to the present day. Presumably, Prisoner Zero hasn't had time to form the ""psychic link"" it needs to maintain a disguise, so what is this?",0,1303680719,null,0,false,0,c1qssbw,t3_gwfmt,t1_c1qssbw,t3_gwfmt,1427090838,9,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,9
