true,PSBlake,null,null,"My spoilered story isn't a classic-Who TV episode, it's an audio drama. One of the odder ones, in fact. I don't feel any need to be consistent with paradoxes, though, since A) It's already established that the Whoniverse *isn't* consistent with paradoxes, and B) The Story of ~~Bob~~ does not necessarily take place in the Whoniverse, whereas my idea for a sequel to any given Big Finish Doctor Who audio drama necessarily *does.*

However, apparent paradox inconsistency can be handled easily - It is established within the Whoniverse that different points in spacetime have different levels of causal rigidity: There are ""fixed points"", historical linchpins, ontological *cul-de-sacs*, and all the myriad  instances where a little meddling is a harmless endeavor. The apparent effect caused by a paradox is actually caused by the degree of damage the paradox causes to normal spacetime and the vortex. The rigidity of spacetime surrounding a particular event is likely linked to the Schrödinger-like collapse of the event's uncertainty waveform.

The problem isn't changing established history: The problem is making certain that your changes encompass all potential observers without encompassing the whole of spacetime. As we later learned, Pete Taylor's survival results in a vastly different future for humanity. Since Earth is known to later become a spacefaring race, substantial changes to its history ripple outward. A backwater planet with little to no contact with other systems (cumulative across the planet's entire history), however, can safely be trapped in a paradox without having any effect on the rest of reality.

Time is like a structure built from loose rocks. Removing a rock always runs the risk of altering the overall stability of the structure, but the *size* of the rock has little bearing on the effect of its removal - the important factor is how much of a load that particular rock was holding up. Even then, some load-bearing rocks can be removed without causing the structure to collapse - it merely stabilizes into a new shape.

Back to the Story of ~~Bob~~:The problem I've had with presenting the oscillating timeline concept as a sustained narrative is, well, sustaining the narrative for longer than a few thousand words.

First of all, the Time Lords aren't time locked in the classic series so the Doctor visits them. Secondly, 8 of our 11 Doctors are in classic, so you miss out on a lot of good stories and Doctors by not seeing classic. (even if it has every sci-fi stereotype of cheesiness ever- it's still awesome)

The very first description of Gallifrey is in The Sensorites I believe (who are related to the Ood). The third Doctor talks about this dude who had an influence on his childhood. There's a lot of stuff about other famous Time Lords and the 7th Doctor gets a lot of that.

Most people don't read or consider the comics and books (or audios) canonical. Generally the DW continuity is like a cafeteria lunch. You can pick and choose bits to believe. i.e. the 8th movie states the Doctor is half human. The DW comic The Forgotten says he was just lying, which makes more sense.

I am the last watcher, keeper of times,

Alone in my quest for now it so seems.

I steady the balance of the worlds' climes,

Protecting all kinds from villainous fiends.

I fly through the vortex, Creation's gate,

Through wild and fire t'ward what none knows.

I run not to seek but to hide from fate,

To evade and avoid my greatest foes.

I am the one who finds life within death,

Who wanders aloof across the bright stars,

Until some venture should take my last breath,

Perhaps upon Saturn, Neptune, or Mars.

Blackpool has literally nothing.

If it was up to me I'd make it Britain's Sin City where everything goes.  Legalise drugs, turn whole hotels into brothels, slash regulations and safety restrictions and duty inside the city limit.  A gambling den or casino on every street.  Strippers and sex clubs.  Britain's naughty side.  There's no way it will ever get a reputation for respectable.  Might as well embrace the dark side.

true,Spankersore,dalek,Dalek,"That will probably be the workaround, at least for the number of remaining regenerations River had. It was rather fortunate that she was still in her regeneration process when the Doctor needed resurrection, and this able to direct the energy to him.  On the other hand, all the energy of those future regenerations might have been spent in resurrecting him.

One of the workarounds from which The Master benefitted was the award of a new cycle of regenerations from the Time Lords as a reward for his assistance in the defeat of The Black Guardian (if I recall correctly). That event has two possible implications for the Doctor. The first being that regular Gllifreyans do not regenerate and, upon becoming a Time Lord, a Gallifreyan is artificially granted 12 regenerations. This would mean that to continue past the 12 limit, the Doctor would have to find a way to keep obtaining regenerations. With no other Time Lords around, he may have to resort to stealing other people's bodies, like The Master did before being awarded the new cycle. This of course would mean that the Doctor would psychologically descend into darkness and evil (Valyard, anyone?), and we, as fans would be hard pressed to accept that.  

The second possible implication is that during the course of their evolution, all Gallifreyans developed the ability to regenerate indefinitely. Perhaps out of political or population control measures, the Time Lords artificially limited regular Gallifreyans to zero regenerations, and then allowed them up to 12 upon becoming a Time Lord. I like this option as the workaround for the Doctor; now that the Time Lords are out of the picture, the artificial limitation to 12 is null and void, and the Doctor can now regenerate indefinitely. This actually fits in really well with other things we have seen in the new series, for in Father's Day, The Doctor tells Rose that ""there used to be rules against &lt;&lt;crossing your own time stream&gt;&gt;-- the TARDIS could not do it until after the destruction of Gallifrey. Also, prior to Gallifrey's demise, all TARDISes were powered through The Eye Of Harmony, a mini black hole on board the TARDIS that drew energy from a quantum singularity (bigger black hole of the same name) located inside Gallifrey via a wormhole.  After Gallifrey burned, the TARDIS had to start drawing power from rifts by parking on them and recharging. 

It would follow that River gave up her ""remaining regenerations"" to resurrect The Doctor as she was not Gallifreyan, but ""human plus"" as remarked in ""A Good Man Goes To War"". Her regenerations were teased out of her time vortex-altered DNA by The Silence in their effort to create a Time Lord.

true,[deleted],null,null,"**THE WHOLE POINT OF RENTING HAS NEVER BEEN ABOUT IT BEING CHEAPER THAN THE MONTHLY PAYMENTS ON A MORTGAGE, NOT EVER.** And if you think that then you're a fucking fool TBH. Hell back in 1985 my rent was more than a mortgage was for the flat I was in and was for every subsequent flat. In the 1990's the rent for the house I was in was more than the mortgage payments. However there was one common factor amongst all the places that I rented and that was that like most people renting I didn't have an income sufficient enough to get a mortgage and I didn't have enough savings for a deposit. And that was over a 14 year span from when I left home at 16 years old in the mid 1980s. So if you think the situation you are in now is something new son, it ain't. You are in the same situation as people have been in this country for many many decades.

So lets get back to this house of yours. When the boiler packs in on that £450 house, who pays for it? The Landlord. I had to have a callout for a leak on the boiler in my house and it cost me £200 by the time it was done with. 

Lets take that £85k house you are in though and do a few sums....

The typical BTL mortgage is about 4.2%. The interest payment is £297 a month. So that leaves £150 a month or £1800 a year which has to pay for a minimum of:

* Buildings insurance - £150
* Landlord Gas Safety Check - £150

assuming there are no changes of tenant and no repairs to do. As soon as there are any repairs, you kiss goodbye to money.
So we're down to £1500. Now lets assume they use a letting agency who will typically charge about 10% of the monthly rental as a fee so thats about £55 a month or £660 a year. We're now down to about £850 profit. And that is £850 profit providing there are no repairs, no legal fees to pay, the tenant pays all the rent and doesn't destroy the place. So that is £850 a year profit or £70 a month but is possibly less if things need doing to the property.

The house I let out will need next year both front windows replacing so that'll wipe out most of the profit for that year. Sometime in the next couple of years the whole central heating system is going to need replacing so that'll wipe out the entire years profit for that year and probably most of the following year as well.

true,bowling4meth,english,Straight out of Surrey,"I have to say that ExdigguserPies has made a really good attempt at showing our equivalent. The problem is that our taxation and benefits systems are so byzantine that it's almost impossible to make this sort of graph, and I wouldn't be at all surprised if that wasn't at least a positive side benefit in the government's eyes, if not a preference.

Some examples (and I'm not saying that ExdigguserPies is doing anything wrong):

* We're charting income, not income versus cost of living. For example, I would technically be in the top 1%, except for the fact that I haven't worked for about 8 years. I made some money, lost some money and am living off residual income. I have some nice assets I can sell if I want a big bucket of cash but on the whole I've had to adjust to make ends meet a little bit.

* Assets aren't counted here. As I mentioned earlier, I have a few but at the same time as probably qualifying for some benefits I have a lot of money in property that despite the crash is (on paper) technically valuable but I wouldn't be able to shift a fair amount of it without making a massive loss compared to keeping hold of it until the market recovers. Does this make me poor or rich? I think rich, which is why I don't claim benefits. I can always sell something and make a big loss in the long term for short term gain.

* The tax rules, being complex beasts that they are change each year

* The graph isn't adjusted for inflation

* If you look at the two orange lines you'll see the data isn't complete

* We're not sure if it's pre-fudge or post-fudge figures in terms about how income is calculated (which is more a problem with HMG data than ExdigguserPies' excellent work)

* Geography plays a much larger part in wage disparity in the UK. Living in London costs a fortune, living in South Wales considerably less

* Contractors for example, technically fall into the 1%, as do most company directors in non-giant corporations that take an optimum dividend split instead of straight salary (to minimise tax payments in a completely legal manner)

There's many other things that make it difficult to get an accurate picture, but to be fair I wouldn't say that the overall picture is wrong, just perhaps that targeting that top 1% might be. Your average Philip Green doesn't even make the chart, nor do your bankers (probably because what they declare as taxable income isn't even the same as you).

I dunno, maybe there's better stat sources for comparison but it doesn't look that bad to me, but also looks completely unrepresentative of the better paid. For example, around 2000-2001 IIRC I was paid £235k through various means, all of which technically legal at the time. I didn't pay an awful lot of tax on it, but I don't see me on that graph anywhere, and I know I wasn't the only one in that bracket.",0,1318621028,null,0,false,0,c2rixzh,t3_lc029,t1_c2rixzh,t3_lc029,1427732390,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

- Used view A w/the bows, black satin for the bodice

- Cut 3"" strips of the dress material (with and against grain of skirt), folded in half lengthwise and pressed, sewed, turned inside out and sewed to the bodice top as shown before sewing front and backs together.

- Added black satin on the hem after finishing the skirt (used pattern and compass to create pattern)

- Ironed on interfacing to the skirt to give the bumps some structured fabric to attach to

- Bumps are made from those kid's toy balls used in the jumping pits, cut in half and spray painted to match the dress color.  Note: Battle tested this dress earlier this month and ended up scraping the paint off some of the bumps - recommend dual coating or testing the paint before wearing.

- Also, there's a full crinoline under the dress as well, important for the shape.

Why do you think CDS' are a threat to the UK?

personally, i dont think that CDS's pose a specific threat to the UK. we are past that stage thanks to the coalition.

we will have poor growth for a year and a bit which would have happened regardless of which ever party got in power but at least the bond sharks are off our back.

the big threat lies outside of our control... the US and EU debt crisis' is the bottom line. the only thing which the coalition got right was making a lot of very public noise about dealing with the debt. its important to remember that our finances are worse than a lot of countries under pressure in the EU right now and we havent actually cut anything yet, its all just proposals, but yet we look like going into the next crisis with our bonds seen as a safe haven for investors, this in itself is a fucking PR master stroke and the average brit will never really appreciate what a miracle the coalition has pulled off, once the imminent threat of the debt crisis has passed, there will not be such an emphasis on budgets and debt, but right now its flavour of the month.

You then stand in a queue for a while until you pay for what you have chosen and then wait until your number is up, which at christmas is longer.

In the back of the shop there is a warehouse. When your order comes through to the 'other side' someone will pick out all the things you ordered and put them onto a conveyor belt or rack, right in front of your face but not quite within reach.

Its not possible to just get your things. You and the other customers in the holding pen must first play a game of ""bingo"" as you watch your things being picked up and put down again in the distance as the machine calls out seemingly random numbers.

If you are not from the UK, and if you get the opportunity - visit Argos either on the 23/24th December - so many happy faces.

Really, what better way to build up to the 50^th anniversary than to focus on the longest-running mystery since the show's inception? The lack of mystery surrounding the Doctor is something that I feel has been sorely missing since the revival, and most of the business with the Time War was finalised in *The End of Time*.

Was the question obvious? Yes. A bit cheesy? Perhaps. But more importantly, it gives the show another shot at further developing the Doctor's character beyond simply being *The Last of the Time Lords™*, and might finally give a proper explanation for his claim of being ""far more than just another Time Lord.""*

true,[deleted],null,null,"Season 1: Tie between the Daleks and the Keys of Marinus

Season 2: Another tie: The Dalek Invasion of Earth and the Time Meddler

Season 3: Lots of lost episodes, some gems among them, but gotta go with the Celestial Toymaker

Season 4: Again, lots of missing. Three way tie (none of them complete stories :( ): Tenth Planet, Power of the Daleks, Evil of
the Daleks (I *do* have a thing for 1960s Dalek stories, yes.)

Season 5: Tomb of the Cybermen, hands down, but probably because it's actually complete. Ice Warriors and Fury from the Deep are close seconds, maybe even better stories, but recons are a *pain* to watch, imo.

Season 6: hands down the War Games. Honorable mention (first Troughton story I ever saw) goes to Seeds of Death.

Season 7: (Yay for color and no more missing episodes!): The Silurians, but honestly Pertwee's whole first season consists of remarkably good stories.

Season 8: Season 8 focuses almost entirely on the Master and all the stories with the Delgado Master are masterpieces by default. 

Season 9: Another hard choice, but I gotta go with the Time Monster. Honorable mention goes to Curse of Peladon ""Haroon haroon haroon!""

Season 10: The Three Doctors wins , but just barely beats Carnival of Monsters. Honorable mention: Planet of the Daleks. (did I mention I have a thing for Dalek stories?)

Season 11: I can't choose the best, but the worst is definitely Invasion of the Dinosaurs.

Season 12: (Hi, Tom!) The Ark in Space. Yes, Genesis of the Daleks was in this season and is obviously a landmark of the show, great story and important in the history of the show, but Ark beats it for pure awesome.

Season 13: Pyramids of Mars. Sutekh still frightens me, even though the sets and effect haven't aged well. First story I ever saw, when I was 5. Very close second: Brain of Morbius.

Season 14: Ridiculously amazing season, one of Tom's many. Robots of Death. Close second: Deadly Assassin. Honorable mention: Talons of Weng Chiang (shows its age a bit too much these days sadly).

Season 15: Horror of Fang Rock&gt;The Sun Makers&gt;Underworld&gt;The Invasion of Time, but all these stories are so amazing that they are just a hair away from being unable to rank for me.

Season 16 (Key to Time): The Pirate Planet and the Armageddon Factor are the two best serials. Power of Kroll and The Androids of Tara are the worst.

Season 17: City of Death followed closely by Destiny of the Daleks. Honorable mention: Nightmare of Eden. 

Season 18: Honestly can't pick. I guess Full Circle isn't my favorite, but beyond that, I honestly can't decide. 

Season 19: (Hi, Peter!) Earthshock. *VERY* close second: Kinda.

Season 20: Snakedance. Close second: Arc of Infinity. Honorable mention: Enlightenment followed distantly by King's Demons.

Season 21: Planet of Fire followed closely by Caves of Androzani (That's right, DW hivemind. I like the previous story better than *Caves*, but not by much) Honorable mention: The Awakening.

Season 22: (Colin!!! Old Sixy. STFU, haters.) Vengeance on Varos, close second: Attack of the Cybermen. Honorable mention: The Two Doctors and Mark of the Rani (You got me. I'm also a fan of Ainley's Master. Again, haters, STFU.)

Season 23: TTL is one long story, but Mindwarp is my favorite.

Season 24: (""You ain't seen nothing yet!!!"" Hello, Sylvester!) Paradise Towers. Honorable mention: Dragonfire.

Season 25: The Greatest Show in the Galaxy. Close second: Rememberance of the Daleks. Honorable mention: Silver Nemesis.

Season 26: Believe it or not, Curse of Fenric is my least favorite story from season 26, and I'll leave it there.

Season 27 (Series 1): Agree with OP. Honorable mention: Dalek.

Season 28 (Series 2): Agree with OP, but disagree that Christmas Invasion was at all a good story.

Season 29 (Series 3): Agree with OP, similar reasons and opinions.

Season 30: (Series 4): Midnight followed by Turn Left. Liked Sil/FotD, but not the best of that season taken by itself, imo.

Season 31: (Series 5) The Lodger. Close second: Vincent and the Doctor. Honorable mention (best intro story for a newly regenerated Doctor of all time, and that's *high* praise, considering its the latest and I'm a *huge* fan of classic Who): Eleventh Hour.

ALL of our defenders are prone to the occasional costly error. Dawson last year was probably worse than Assou-Ekotto in that regard, it amazes me that some of our fans rate him so highly but think BAE is poor. 

Fact is, he was incredibly consistent last year and so far--with the exception of a mixed day against Wigan--he's been the same this year. 

I honestly prefer his style to that of an overlapping fullback. He really complements Bale brilliantly. ",0,1318644136,null,0,false,0,c2rlyqz,t3_lavny,t1_c2rlyqz,t1_c2rb5s2,1427733810,1,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,1

true,Tehatimmeh,eccleston,Eccleston,"**Series 1:** Same as you, The Doctor Dances. It was creepy, it took place during the London Blitz, and the Doctor was just so happy. It was beautiful.

**Series 2:** This is sort of a tie between Tooth and Claw and Doomsday. The former because I loved the Victorian werewolf setting, and the whole plan that the men had made to save the queen before she even got there was neat. The latter because it was heartbreaking (to me and at least a few others), and I seem to be a sucker for that kind of episode. 

**Series 3** Easily Human Nature/Family of Blood. The 'bad guys' were scary enough, the setting was lovely, and again, it broke my heart a little. 

**Series 4** Midnight. I think I love it mostly because I found it really creepy. The whole thing with the other passengers turning on the Doctor - the only guy who maybe knew how to solve the problem - that's awesome. 

**Series 5** The Lodger. Man, this one made me laugh. I love Craig. I love the Doctor trying to ""be a normal bloke"". It was ridiculous. Close second is Vincent and the Doctor - so much crying caused by this episode. 

**Series 6** Eeeaaaasily the Doctor's Wife. Written by one of my favourite authors, Neil Gaiman. I won't spoil it, but it's funny and sad and excellent.

Anyway, this was a neat idea for a post. It made me actually think about all my favourites. There are a few more I'd probably add to this if given the chance, including Waters of Mars from the specials done in 2010.

true,janoo1989,tom-baker,Tom Baker,"**Series 1**: *Bad Wolf/The Parting of the Ways* - The hype for the final episode was sufficiently delivered. This was before Daleks and the infamous ""RTD *Deus Ex Machina*"" became laughable. ""You were fantastic, absolutely fantastic. And you know what? So was I"" remains one of my all time favourite lines. 

**Series 2**: *Doomsday* - I'd love to say *The Girl in the Fireplace* as well, because I personally think it's the best episode since the reboot. It also holds up for repeat viewings better than *Doomsday*. However, without the *Dårlig Ulv Stranden* scene, I probably wouldn't be as big a fan as I am now.  That scene got to me completely. 

**Series 3**: *Blink* - No contest. I had to pause the episode mid-way to grab my dog for protection. Apart from being absolutely terrifying, it's also brilliant in a way that only *Doctor Who* can (same thing goes with *The Girl in the Fireplace*).

**Series 4**: *Midnight* - I think this is RTD's masterpiece. The Doctor spends so much time trying to save and inspire humans, we never wonder if we're worth it. In this episode, we aren't. This idea manifests itself in the absolute best way. We start with a group of perfectly normal, likable people. We end with a bunch of vile creatures with blood on their hands.

**Series 5**: *Amy's Choice* - I think this episode is astonishingly underrated. It's a simple character piece that manages to tell us everything we need to know about Rory, Amy and the Doctor in less than 45 minutes. Amy's ""what is the point of you?"" really resonates. Mind you, I also think *Vincent and the Doctor* is absolutely terrific. Objectively, I'd say it's the best episode of series 5. I also liked the final lines, ""The ultimate ginge. Brighter than sunflowers"" (also by Amy). 

**Series 6**: *The Impossible Astronaut/Day of the Moon* - I think this episode deserve even more acclaim than it has already received. It's not just the scale and setting of the adventure. This two-parter steers the show into a new direction and manages to change the tone almost immediately. I also love the back-and-forth between River and the Doctor,

Doctor: And Doctor Song, you’ve got that face on again.

River: What face?

Doctor: The ‘he’s hot when he’s clever’ face.

River: This is my normal face.

There is a black and white, 6-parter, reconstructed Dalek story that I think beats the hell out of any new Who story with Daleks: Power of the Daleks.

And in fact tonight I just watched Resurrection of the Daleks which I thought was even better (Davros!).  And Genesis of the Daleks is the story that made me decide I would watch all of classic Who in the first place (that and it was summer break).

I think that if you watch Face of Evil, Logopolis, Genesis of the Daleks, Robots of Death, The Mind Robber, and at least, for the sake of Who-history, An Unearthly Child (just the first part), then you might be convinced.

Of course that's just my opinion. And I adored the Five Doctors. Actually, I didn't care for it the first time I saw it (before I knew anything about classic), but after watching Doctors 1-5, it was so cool. It's one of those ""fan"" episodes.

If you're having trouble with classic Who, there is Adventures with the Wife in Space which you can read alongside your viewing of Hartnell and Troughton.

Thank you for saying this, that bothered me when I saw that episode too. I don't know much about quantum mechanics, but the point of ""Blink"" was, not to blink in the presence of Weeping Angels. And yet Amy blindly walked around them and not one went after her. So they can notice blinking but not someone with their eyes closed, pretending to see? I did like some aspects of ""Flesh and Stone"", like showing the Angels visibly degrading after not consuming any time energy, but the nice-assassin turned stone-cold (heh) killer was just odd. That and the whole ""Angel Bob"", I thought that was kind of dumb.

true,KR4T0S,null,null,"Well Verne and Wells are credited with largely creating and making popular science fiction. I don't know as much as I should about Verne but I know Wells was pretty outspoken about racism.

Wells thought at some point in human history racism would cease to exist because the worlds populations would interbreed and we would forget what our roots were. It sounds like a crazy concept but consider British people assimilated with The Romans, Normans and Anglo-Danes and nobody says ""my roots are part Roman, part Anglo-Danish"", perhaps nobody will say ""I am South African and Spanish"" for example one day.

Honestly ""The Time Machine"" is a great book to read, it says a lot about racism, prejudism, class warfare, war, eugenics etc etc. It's a bit hard to get to because he doesn't make it black and white but if you examine his works you see all these ideas he had about the future of humanity and the likes.

This won't mean much to you OP, but Sky aren't exactly known for high quality original content. They generally buy in the good stuff, their big hit was signing an exclusive contract for the Simpsons during the first series that prevented any other broadcaster in the UK or Ireland getting it for about ten years after.

Anyway, back to my point...Sky launched Mount Pleasant, Trollied and Jinsy around the same time a month or three back. On the back of the recent resurgence in original British Comedy on BBC3/4 and particularly Channel4/E4's success with the Inbetweeners and so on they decided to jump on the bandwagon.

The problem is Sky are incredibly ham-handed and go for the tabloid-reading audience...unsurprising as Murdoch is all over both in the UK. Their attempt to launch this new comedy lineup completely lacked the grace or subtlety of the BBC, they've been running ads for all of them non-stop. Before Trollied even aired they were already referring to it as their new ""smash hit series"". To be fair these all look a bit better than the usual Sky tripe, and Trollied isn't bad so I think I'll check this out.

Here's the end to my rant...a prediction. Sky lack the scruples and patience they need to win out in the original content world. If these things aren't a smash hit success either ratings wise or in terms of awards they'll be canned very quickly. Where the BBC might have a few short runs and give something the benefit of the doubt, Sky want ratings NOW.

Things such as wearing uniform, providing tools, how you are paid (per job or per week), is it you taking a financial risk, can you choose your own hours or give your work to other people? If they have arranged the job properly you could pass for self employed, there will always be something touch and go, but it's not fatal to self employed status.

You will get no holiday pay, could earn less than minimum wage, have to pay your own tax and really have no job security- you can be 'let go' on a moments notice. But you could also get the benefits- choosing your own hours can be a nice one, as is taking expenses from your earnings for tax purposes (this bit can be very good if you need to buy equipment to get going). I think you can register for VAT but it's not compulsory earning less than 50k. If you need to spend money to do the job, and some VAT is paid on those expenses, getting VAT from your boss can also work out nice.

In the event of any dispute, the tax people will look at all the evidence of self-employed status and what they decide is final really- not whatever a 'contract' says. So if your 'boss' does it wrong by forcing you to do the things he shouldn't be able to force a self employed person to do he can be hit hard by the tax man later on. He's probably doing it so that when he doesn't need you it's easier to get rid of you- again, if he gets it wrong you 'could' still claim wrongful/unfair dismissal if the court thinks you weren't really self employed.

In my own experience, when I was a learner driver I slowed right down because I thought a woman was cycling across the road at a pedestrian controlled crossing. She was only on one peddle and stepped off at the island. A an Audi TT wrote both our cars off when he slammed into the back of me because he wasn't paying attention.

I wondered why you sort of went off sheet a bit.


&gt;*There are guidelines in my work place too, and people can potentially die if they fail to follow them. If someone did make a cock-up and break those rules with minimal consequence, there will be a strict talking to, the mistake recorded and looked into to prevent it happening again. A one-off, is exactly that.*

Sorry to go over this again but I feel I need to emphasise particular things about the position of a cabinet minister, and (what we know of) his behaviour in this matter:

For Liam Fox to attain the position he held is not a job you can find in the job centre or walk into off the street. It has taken a lot of groundwork and he has undergone a certain amount of, shall we say, ""grooming"". There is a certain amount of expectation to ""know what the fuck you are doing"" when reaching such a position.

Because of that, I think we can rule out any potential of ignorance of what the ministerial code of conduct is.

Now, as far as what we know of his ""transgression"", it seems at the very least, he showed a complete lack of judgement in taking his friend, who had no security clearance, around the world and granting him access to some high level people, and to meetings where he really should not have been.

* If his friend was just a 'sightseeing tourist' along for the ride, or his secret lover, then Liam Fox is a fucking idiot and we frankly cannot have fucking idiots as Minister of Defence. 

* If his friend was his unofficial ""advisor"" then it shows a complete lack of judgement and inability to follow protocol (getting the guy clearance, vetting, etc). Again, we cannot have this kind of guy as MoD, or in any position of government.

* If his friend is a lobbyist and was arranging deals, then Liam Fox is corrupt, should face the full measure of the law and be serving at her majesty's pleasure.",0,1318678748,null,0,false,0,c2rok1a,t3_lc4i3,t1_c2rok1a,t1_c2roger,1427735120,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

true,[deleted],null,null,"You seem to think there is nothing to protest about, but I disagree. We have high inflation, insane house prices/rents, increasing living costs in everything meanwhile the privatised utilities make record profits, high unemployment with no plan for reduction, etc.

The worst problem is the fact that we have a receding economy and a sovereign debt crisis at the same time. There is no way out. Normally you would get the government to borrow and invest in public works, etc. to stimulate employment and consumer demand, but we can't do that if the government can't borrow easily. Meanwhile making further cuts raises unemployment, reduces purchasing power of the masses and worsens the recession. We try to alleviate this through easy credit, but this is unsustainable and leads to big bank failures, meanwhile creating more money to lend (perhaps even directly) causes inflation as there is no economic growth in sync with it, and we can't raise interest rates because that will cause foreclosures, lower purchasing power and worsen the recession.

All the while technological progress means it is easier and easier to offshore and automate work, which is driving down wages (and so leading to recessions) whilst corporation tax is driven down by globalisation (contributing to national debt crises).

The real problem is that they have no clear list of demands at all, and so it seems there is nothing to protest about. In my opinion they should list the following things which most people will agree with:

* Renationalise rail and utilities (perhaps without compensation, otherwise it is just another avenue for corruption with huge payouts, as was the initial privatisation), run these as a public service at break-even prices.

* Stop the plan to give degree-awarding powers to private companies.

* Stop the planned NHS reforms to remove the limits on private patients and further the market system in NHS management.

* Rather than bailing out the banks with more QE measures, nationalise the failing banks.

* Build more social housing, and convert the foreclosed properties of the newly nationalised banks in to social housing.

* Use the nationalised bank to provide loans to small businesses, home-buyers at reasonable deposits and interest rates.

* Stop the sale of public land, give walkers' rights over all land within national parks, except that necessary for military purposes.

* Change all the progressive tax systems to use functions of wealth rather than arbitrary bands. Abolish regressive taxes.

* Abolish housing benefits, tax credits etc. and move to a system of Negative Income Tax (you are paid money towards a minimum level and taxed above it), and a minimum income.

I'm actually a socialist, and don't think we can get out of our economic problems through these measures alone (you can't stimulate consumer demand easily when the means of production are still privatised as the wealth is soon concentrated again, and increasing automation and offshoring will lead to unemployment and a further concentration of wealth and recessions), but at least this is a start.

It is part of a wider 'meme' of protest and resistance worldwide, which although connecting movements in very different contexts, is all essentially about extending democratic control of power. It is driven not by an organised manual working class (although the unions participate, they are not the driving force) but by unemployed graduates who were sold a vision of the future thats not there anymore.

It is not anticapitalist but calls for limits on capitalist power.

I just don't get the point of protesting because life is difficult. We know that. We want the government to draw up good policies to improve people's lives but standing in the street is totally bloody pointless.

Outstanding players for me 

* Gerrard - so glad to see him back, after 6 months out he's already marauding the midfield like a boss.
* Enrique - once again, a mountain in defence and el Toro in attack. Put in a few good crosses that I thought Carroll could have done well with.
* Kelly - kept Young quiet all game so much to make Fergie take him off, did his job quietly and comfortably.
* Adam - excellent today. Put in his fair share of tackles and kept things ticking over with Gerrard about roaming. Was nice to see he can go on a bit of a run too ;)

Worthy mentions - Suarez &amp; Henderson. With Jordan, his energy and general quick feet and movement was good to see against a tiring team, reinforces the point that he should be used as an impact sub if I'm honest. If he starts it needs to be in the middle, and he probably will with Lucas suspended for Norwich. And his attacking, who said hes not creative? He's plenty creative when he isn't trying too hard, if that makes sense &lt;_&lt;

Suarez had brilliant movement and tenacity but I think he really thrives with (and needs) a strike partner. He looked a bit lost with the ball around the area at times and the United defence could concentrate on keeping him isolated with no other strikers to keep them occupied. Oh, and he needs to improve his finishing, but I still think we haven't seen the best of him finishing wise yet by a long shot.

Downing and Kuyt were decent but didn't do enough end product wise over the 90 minutes. I think one of them substituted with Bellamy would have been a good choice alongside Henderson.

Unemployment is a particularly clear example in this case, where it benefits business owners through cheaper labour, destroys unions, leads to worsening working conditions, etc. - so if the government is financed solely by business owners then it has little to worry about unemployment. And often they will argue that high unemployment is ""necessary"" from their comfortable salaries and benefits in the House Of Commons.

I agree that standing in the street doesn't help, but directed, organised action can force the government's hand. Look at the Upper Clyde dockyards, or Poll Tax for example. If no-one does anything then things will never change, if it weren't for my Master's work I'd be there today.

&gt;As for socialism the UK rejected it in the 1970s because it was a complete disaster. Would you really prefer to go back to the three day week, strikes and blackouts?

Do you really believe that would happen now?

I support socialism because it is just what is fair, I mean, why should some people be able to live on others' labour without ever working, simply because they ""own"" land or resources (which they also did nothing to produce). Besides, in a socialist economy we can use automation and technology to the benefit of all, and provide employment for all, to lower the working hours of all. This seems far more logical than the absurd situation we face now, where there are people who want to work (builders, etc.), people who need goods (homes, etc.) and yet neither can act in the economy because they haven't the purchasing power/means of production to do so. What is so absurd about having an equal obligation to work for all people, and using the communal resources of the nation for the communal benefit of its citizens? Why do we find it acceptable that those who do little to no work often live in better conditions than those who do, and the former usually command the latter whilst never experiencing the work itself?

You put a lot of faith in the parliamentary system though, I mean, it's no secret that people will vote for the ""least bad"" party. Meanwhile many issues are entirely excluded from national debate within the majority parties, for example, re-nationalisation of utilities, and infamously, a referendum on the European Union.

You can never have a fair democracy so long as there is such great economic inequality. Politics and economics cannot be separated, and the inequality and effective dictatorship of business barons in one, certainly influences the other (in both directions).

true,ErniePlonk,null,null,"How about one of my favourite day trips , It involves rivers , the canal , woods and farmland and a bit of the Pentland hills ... follow with your finger on google maps :) 

Cycle through the meadows heading towards Bruntsfield , then cut down Leamington terrace until you meet the canal ( nice and flat ) . Follow the canal for a few miles until you cross the aqueduct over inglis green rd. Then go over the first bridge you meet that crosses the canal . This will put you on an old railway track that goes along the edge of Colinton dell ( still nice and flat ) . You'll go through a long tunnel , under a bridge and then pass a nice little park on the left ( a good place to stop for a juice etc. I'm pretty sure it's called Spylaw park ) . After the park you'll see an office block and that's your cue to not follow the road round but to follow the river instead . The path follows the Water of Leith most of the way to Balerno .

You're heading for Mansfield Road ( take a left after the high school onto Bavelaw Green , Bavelaw Road and you'll be on it ) Now comes the hard part :) Mansfield road is a long slow slog but it's worth it ( I usually get off and walk near the last steep bend ) Keep going until you see a  carpark on the left . Now head past Theipmuir and Harlaw Resovoirs , past another carpark and down to Harlaw road . Turn right and keep going till you get to the weird bendy bit and it eventually becomes Torduff Road . Downhill now :) pass two more small resovoirs to Bonaly rd . Down to the hill to W mill road &amp; W mill bank and you're back at Spylaw park in Colinton . Now just follow the canal backm into town .

An alternative to heading the same way back ( if you're still looking for more ) . Once you crossed back over the Aqueduct take the stairs that head down underneath to the river below . Following the Water of Leith will take you all the way to Stockbridge ( where I usually stop at Pizza Express ) and on down to Leith Docks if you feel like it .

I usually do this route a few times a year , once each season if I can . There are some better / longer routes through the Pentlands but this one is easier and overall has a good mix of surroundings .

Because they were in the temple, and he didn't think their commerce should be done in a place of worship. The London Stock Exchange -- or any modern bank -- is decidedly not in any such place. 

Also, Jesus made a whip from some rope to drive out the traders. So he was considerably more bad ass and non-law-abiding than the current protestors.

1. River remembers the Doctor because, like the Doctor, she is a complicated space/time event and, as we found out in S6, she is the child of the TARDIS so she will exist ""out of time"" almost and not be affected by the cracks and the rewritten version of the universe without the Doctor.

2. See above for why the diary existed. It was given to River by the Doctor earlier in her time line so from her POV before the events of S5 so she had it then. The physical object existed but it was blank because the stories/events that were written it never happened.

3. The Doctor was restored by Amy because of who she was, the girl who grew up next to the crack in time. I know it doesn't sound like much of an explanation but because of this it affected her somehow and she was able to ""remember"" him back in to existance, similar to how Rory was ""remembered"" as the Roman.

Who's to say what true angels can and can't do compared to the withering ones we say in ""Blink."" 

I take it as the angels can't make eye contact and if they're normal angels i'm sure they've evolved to find a way out of it. Those in Blink used there last bit of energy to try and take the TARDIS failed and where tricked into being immobilized since they could never find a way to get more sustenance. 

Plus, just because the doctor told us about the angels in Blink doesn't means it's definitely true. he's not always right and he doesn't always tell the truth.

Gender has nothing to do with it, only attraction -- I could be a gay female, and therefore attracted, and therefore may masturbate to the picture. Or a gay man could leave a similar comment on another man's picture. It's the *intent* of the commentor that matters.

But, as she said, she wouldn't find it creepy no matter who said that, so it doesn't matter. I didn't know if she would be okay with my comment before her answer, so I included my sex and attraction, therefore (most likely) eliminating the possibility of creeping her out.",0,1318720851,null,0,false,0,c2rsjc4,t3_ldbsr,t1_c2rsjc4,t1_c2rse5p,1427736995,0,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,0

Still, true or not I really hope Kenny can sort out Suarez's behaviour on the pitch. I really dont want these kinds of incidents (racist allegations this week, ""cheater"" allegations last week with Rodwell) to follow him his whole time here at LFC.

The damage has been done though. It's just as hard to prove Evra is lying as proving Suarez guilty, so I feel the FA would just say the evidence is inconclusive (which it is) and thus find Suarez innocent. Which doesn't mean Evra is lying, and Suarez will always have this attributed to him.

**HOWEVER**.

What he did was a real dick move. A real dick move over a shitty argument, in which he basically threw a bitch fit over someone calling him a twat. Let me reiterate. **He wiped the stylesheet and demodded himself more or less *over someone calling him a twat***. Like a goddamn child who decides to take his ball and go home. That pretty much makes him, *a twat* for doing so. However, he *did* give back the stylesheet data to Signe, who was trying to restore the changes by himself which shows he was at least remorseful for doing so.

My point being, Yes arguments happen. Yes, people get riled up about stuff. However, he was in a position of power in which he was expected to conduct himself with some responsibility. Instead, he threw a tantrum over a tiny little thing and committed what I view as an abuse of power as a moderator, and there must be consequences.

I propose we ban his account from this subreddit for a few days, maybe a week.

**AND/OR,**

I propose he be taught a lesson in humility and being thick skinned over petty forum squabbles. I propose that, as the mods have those fun little tags, he be tagged ""Twat"" for no less than a month (starting after the ban, if that takes place), regardless of modship or not.

this isn't a go at you OP but i find a lot of people on r/doctorwho are only fans of the new series which i feel is a shame, especially with the 50th anniversary incoming.

if i had to recommend just one story from each Doctor so you are familiar with them and who they are it'd have to be:

2. Tomb Of The Cybermen

3. The Daemons

4. City Of Death

If you solved the supply problem on homes the price would drop to not far above the cost to build. People would then start defaulting on their shithole. At this point the bank no longer holds a mortgage worth 300K, they hold the property, and have to mark to market. This would trigger another banking crisis.

This is why interest rates are so low. Home owners are being bailed out at the cost of pensioners and savers. And doing it this way is going to take well over a decade.

However, the side effect is inflation which is hurting everyone.

edit: it's also in the government interest to have very high home prices. If you have a family it's no good just the dad working and the mum looking after the kids.

That organisation of society, incorporating elements of tax, usury, landlordism and tariff, which thus denies the free market whilst pretending to exemplify it. (Shea and Wilson, 1975).

Of course, cheerleaders for capitalism have adopted and redefined the term as something along the lines of ""voluntary exchange in a free market"", but that kind of begs the question, given that such a situation has never and will never arise under capitalism (capitalism was created by massive State intervention and has been enforced through massive State intervention since its inception).  It's instructive to debate hardline Libertarian ""free marketeers"" who claim to support laissez faire capitalism about this, and you'll find many hopelessly flip flop about between defending currently existing corporate capitalism (implying it is a free market) to not doing so depending on the issue under discussion.

Theoretically, yes.  But in practice, no.  At best it could be said that we live under a democratically elected oligarchy.  But even then, it can be argued that our system of election is far from democratic.

Everyone gets a vote, but unless you vote for the winning party your vote doesn't count.  If you're a Labour supporter living in Surrey, or a Conservative living in Scotland then you might as well stay at home on election day.  Your vote doesn't count.

Even under proportional representation, the current system of party politics means that a select few politicians (i.e. the PM and other cabinet ministers) dictate policy and the party whips ensure that all the other politicians elected under their banner vote accordingly.  There would be a more even distribution of politicians, but ultimately power would rest in the hands of the leader of the party with the most MPs.

true,widgetas,null,null,"*Long comment - This has been bugging me for years*

As far as I can tell, the issue is not that ""city dwellers"" love the cute cuddly foxes, but that people in general disapprove of the way and reasons people fox hunt.

Initially the defence was very much ""It has to be done to control fox numbers because they are a pest. It is needed."" then when that argument was brushed aside to a certain extent the position moved to ""It is our way of life - you wouldn't understand, it is tradition."" Then when the legislation was on the way it became something like ""You're trying to spoil our fun and it's not fair. You're jealous because you have to live in the city."" - That's a broad overview, but I'm sure many will agree with my summary. The arguments did change over the years and in the late 90's I never heard anyone officially admit that it was a fun or for sport. That only came about after they realised things were going south.

Things I've heard that never make sense to me include: ""We only kill the old and sick foxes, so it's actually kinder to them. They were going to die painfully but we finished it quickly."" - If you're trying to kill pests (which we are told foxes are) then why keep the population healthy? Please don't see this as a strawman, as I don't think this is a rare excuse. Don't forget how many hunts have been found breeding foxes.

For me the issue has never been that they're killing foxes that pose a danger to livestock, but *how* they kill the foxes. Leaving aside the issue of how the animal is actually offed, it is the ceremony, pomp, *tradition* and the fun that people have. I'm not saying they shouldn't be having fun because I'm not, but rather why do they have to make the killing of an animal - something we are led to believe is a chore - such entertainment. Why the red coats, the port, the gathering with crowds or having scores of riders join them?

Yes it's a way to raise money for the hunt to survive, but it seems to be a self sustaining machine in a way. Need to hunt foxes on horses but don't have the money so get people along to ride with them so they can continue to hunt on horses etc.

The overall issue is that if fox hunting continues as it is, then people are being allowed to *kill* animals for fun in an exhilarating way. Whether or not that animal needs to be killed is irrelevant - the participants are actively gaining pleasure from chasing and killing the fox. This sort of thing is already banned in other ways, why is the extension so controversial?

I know a couple of families who fox hunt. They're horse lovers and both farming types. Very much in favour of hunting because they get to ride over fields etc. as described in this article too. Of course you have to ""see the devastation after a fox gets into a chicken run to understand"" why the fox needs to go, I'm told. One of them tells me how often they catch foxes with shotgun pellets under the skin which shows that killing the foxes with guns won't work. If it was left to the farmers then the animals will suffer. (edit - [someone made such a comment a while after I posted this](http://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/ldz26/hunting_who_let_the_dogs_out_six_years_after/c2rx0f4)) In that case I have to wonder how often farmers manage to take out rabbits and no-one from the hunting fraternity seems worried by the bunnies suffering. One family has several severed brushes hanging from a shelf, so it would appear trophies are part of pest control still.

Both families find it amusing that they and others flout the ban by riding, and are quite open that foxes are still being killed. The attitude is very much town vs. country and that people just don't understand the ways of rural areas.

One final point associated with the loss of jobs with kennels, is that we were told that hunts would have to cull all their hounds as they're working dogs and can't be 'homed'. It's been nearly 7 years now, long enough for a number of hounds to have died off and yet the packs are still the same size (we assume). But seeing as we are told in the article that the journalist attended a 'Puppy Show', the hunts are still breeding hounds. I might be stating the obvious, but it's perfectly clear the hunts have no intention of ever backing down.

Here's an idea for the countryside to make some cash. Farmers and landowners: Open certain areas of your land for riders to chase around effectively having a 'race', like the already do, but sans hounds and killing. How would that be different, apart from the obvious lack of adrenaline you'd have by not chasing a fox, which is the issue in the first place: Excitement and fun from killing an animal.

Feel free to criticise any points I've made - as I say this issue for me is not that it has to be done, but *how* it is done. To quote a relative: ""If you need to kill the animal then there's no need to get all ponced up and bounce around the place with your mates."" And f you're going to downvote please tell me why, otherwise I won't understand the issue from your (opposing) point of view. Cheers.

This doesn't make *sense*. If you have a dog in a fight, you don't want him to die. You want him to live so you can breed him and fight him more. Do you seriously think every dog is fought *once* to the death? It takes a lot of time and energy to get a dog conditioned into fighting shape. Fights to the death just don't make sense in any context. I'm not saying dogs *never* died, but that it wouldn't make sense in any way for that to be the norm.

&gt; why not enjoy it?

I can't say which came first, but generally people who enjoy killing things are considered to have certain 'issues'. Did the feeling they have issues come about because people thought killing animals is wrong or is killing animals wrong and so people think they have issues? I'm not sure.

I imagine the general feeling, whether correct or not, is that if someone enjoys killing an animal then there might not be much stopping them from progressing to people. Also if they like killing animals that *need* to be killed then they might go about killing other animals for the hell of it. Why not?

As I don't believe in moral absolutes, I can of course agree that 'back in the day' enjoying the act of culling animals probably wasn't a problem. It's only fairly recently that things weren't dying all over the place *all* the time, including people (children). Many people don't seem to appreciate how fortunate we are these days, where death and disease are pretty damn rare. Far more rare than ever before due to advances in medicine and our stable society.

For me to gauge your own feeling and understanding on this issue - Say you had a son and at 4 years old you discovered him in the garden. He's found a mouse's nest and is taking each baby in turn and killing it in a variety of ways. Nothing particularly brutal or sadistic, but offing each mouse in turn. Would you let him carry on or stop him? And why? (I'm not using this as a counter to your point, I'm just following trains of thought).

&gt;  Is this just a new modern society view that killing things is wrong and evil?

I think it's an extension of our empathy. Again possibly because we have grown used to a very non-dangerous pace of life. Areas of the world where death is more common place do not have such a 'rosy' view of killing/mistreating animals. Consider the different ways of slaughtering animals in various parts of the world: I think that countries in which people enjoy a high quality of life have more humane views towards other creatures.

&gt; Is a slaughterman not allowed to enjoy his job either?

It would depend what you mean by ""enjoy"", but I'm sure many do.

&gt; We are still animals, the thrill of the hunt and the kill goes back millennia, I don't see why people are so against that. 

I'm not an expert in evolution, but I imagine that the thrill of the hunt has quite specific evolutionary reasons. If you don't like doing something then you're less likely to do it. It would make sense that a byproduct of hunting is enjoyment - the individuals/groups that liked doing it were more likely to get food and survive. The reason many no longer approve is that we don't *need* to hunt anymore and, similarly to bull fighting, the fox isn't eaten at the end.

I personally also do not like big game hunting or organisd shoots of game birds, but at least those animals are eaten at the end.",0,1318779915,null,0,false,0,c2rxi09,t3_ldz26,t1_c2rxi09,t1_c2rx63f,1427739401,7,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,7

Almost certainly because I am adding nothing to the discussion! But I agree, I think this is an interesting area for discussion.

&gt; For me to gauge your own feeling and understanding on this issue - Say you had a son and at 4 years old you discovered him in the garden. He's found a mouse's nest and is taking each baby in turn and killing it in a variety of ways. Nothing particularly brutal or sadistic, but offing each mouse in turn. Would you let him carry on or stop him? And why? (I'm not using this as a counter to your point, I'm just following trains of thought).

Very nice question.
Lets see, I guess my immediate reaction is to stop him.  I think intent has a lot to do with how a killing should be viewed.  I'm strongly against killing things without reason.  I will only kill something myself if it is:

a) Vermin posing a problem.

b) Tasty.

At 4 years old, I don't think my son would fully comprehend what he was doing, let alone understand that some creatures are (/can be) vermin.  Once he was older, and understood these concepts, then I wouldn't have a problem with him controlling pests with an air rifle or similar.

I'm indifferent towards fox hunting because (in some regions) they are pests that need to be controlled, and if someone can gain enjoyment from controlling the pests, as long as it is not done cruelly, then I don't really have a problem.

_______________

&gt;Areas of the world where death is more common place do not have such a 'rosy' view of killing/mistreating animals. Consider the different ways of slaughtering animals in various parts of the world: I think that countries in which people enjoy a high quality of life have more humane views towards other creatures.

I do draw distinction between mistreating and killing animals.  I happen to think that a quick death by hound is preferable to being shot.  As someone else said, by hound you either die or you don't.  If you're shot you might suffer for days before death.

&gt;The reason many no longer approve is that we don't need to hunt anymore and, similarly to bull fighting, the fox isn't eaten at the end.

I only reconcile fox hunting in my head because it is a pest, I hate pointless killing.

The food aspect is interesting to think about really - not so long ago people had to run down their dinner, kill and gut it etc.  Now days many people are completely disconnected from that aspect of their food.  

Would I rather be a chicken in a barn on a huge farm, or a pheasant running free with a chance of being shot?  A wild boar foraging in the wood that has a chance of being shot, or a sow kept in a crowded pen.   These are somewhat bias examples, but interesting, I think.",0,1318781360,null,0,false,0,c2rxnq3,t3_ldz26,t1_c2rxnq3,t1_c2rxi09,1427739475,7,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,7

true,Chasmosaur,tardis,TARDIS,"Okay, when I'm not here on Reddit, I'm other places on the Internet.  Because that's my job - I'm an Internet developer and consultant, who specializes in usability issues.  The latter requires I think about the sociology and psychology of how people interact on the Internet.

So here's my ""TL;DR"" of the issues here:

**DOWNVOTING**

No one has to justify downvoting a post.  Really.  Everyone comes at this community with their own ideas of what is appropriate and what is not.  If enough people think a post is useful or an awesome piece of fandom, it will find its way to the first few pages, if not the top of the heap.

*Example* - the Dalek dress posted by somevelvetmorning this weekend - that was the top of /r/DoctorWho for many hours - only has 67% upvotes.  1 out of 3 people who voted didn't think it was awesome.  Still got to the top, though, because enough people thought it was cool enough to float it up.

**RULES &amp; REGS**

You can have all the rules and rediquette you like.  Some people follow them, some people accidentally break them (either in a bad snap judgement or simply through newbie-ness), some people ignore them, and some people delight in breaking them.

There really aren't any consequences that significantly alter your life for breaking the rules here.  So there's no reason - other than basic human decency, civility and/or kindness - to follow them.  After 15+ years as a professional observer on Internet behaviour?  Yeah, not everyone on the Internet exhibits human decency.

*Example* - IRL, if themantheycallJayne called a stranger a twat to their face, you could have a variety of things happen (ranging from nothing to a hospital visit).  Here?  Even if he's banned, all he has to do is reboot for a new IP, go to Gmail, make up another e-mail account and a new handle and he's back in.  No incentive to not repeatedly call someone a twat, if you enjoy the results.

**REPOSTS**

I hate them, myself.  If I saw the Balloon TARDIS pop up one more time, I was going to start downvoting every new post.  (Because that many reposts so close together?  I don't think that's appropriate, and I get tired of the karma whoring.)

They are a part of Reddit, though.  It's what happens with communal content sharing.  Some are conscientious enough to search before they post, some are not.  Posting instructions on the left column (where most people do NOT look first - there are studies I could bore the snot out of you with, but I won't), won't necessarily cure all the ills.

My thoughts on it. Mason does all he can to avoid the elephant in the room: the boomers.

&gt; Who were they? This is not yet as demographically wide as the indignado camps in Madrid or Syntagma were when they first started. 

Not as demographically wide? Be more specific Paul, please!

&gt; Most people involved in such protests have switched off from mainstream politics: they believe it's a rich-person's club and totally impenetrable to reason or pressure.

Rich person's club? But everyone gets a vote Paul - who are these ""rich people"" you speak of? Why is it pointless voting?

&gt; Something has been going on between the left earphone and the right earphone of this generation that represents a profound change in attitude. 

Ah - it's a generational thing. Finally it slips out.

So the demographic group is young people. They aren't interested in politics because the boomer block always vote in their own interest and load debt onto future generations.

Why aren't all the people in charge at the BBC, people in their 40s and over, ever mentioning that former generations are still doing very nicely in their expensive houses with their generous pension schemes? Surely as professionals they can overcome their self-interest and not lead strikes (like Paul Mason [did](http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2010/nov/05/bbc-television-centre-picket-line)) over pension deals beyond the wildest dreams of today's youngsters.

One way or another it's a transfer of wealth from young to old. Either you buy their house which they got far cheaper in real terms, putting money directly into their pocket and loading yourself with half a lifetime of debt, or you pay off their mortgage direct.

OK we're agreed that in many cases foxes need to be killed. But the problem we have is that even though people are hired by farmers etc. to hunt foxes, many of those who hunt don't need to be there. Nor does the hunting *have* to be done in the way it is - with all the ceremony, pomp, horses and hounds.

&gt;  if someone can gain enjoyment from controlling the pests, as long as it is not done cruelly, then I don't really have a problem.

Back to your earlier comment you made elsewhere about your friend enjoying culling deer. I can fully understand and appreciate that. Not having ever been shooting or even killed an animal other than fish for my own sustenance, I can't really comment. But I imagine I would gain some sense of satisfaction, particularly if I then butchered and prepared it. However, again that's an animal being killed for food.

As it stands right now, I don't think I have a counter to the above statement you made. However, when it comes to fox hunting I think it is cruel. Ignoring whether or not the kill at the end is quick, the fox will always be chased. It will always be frightened and running for its life. There's always going to be some degree of upset for the animal, but with chasing with dogs there's going to be guaranteed anguish for the fox.

For example, I'd imagine you would be prepared to kill an animal to satisfy the first three levels of the triangle; you would kill an animal that was blocking your access to air or water, you obviously wouldn't have a problem with harming or killing an animal to create a habitat for yourself, and you would probably kill an animal if it threatened a love one.

true,jamesdownwell,cnty-expat,Expat,"I remember at school I once debated a teacher on capital punishment, ""Why?"" I argued ""should someone who takes the life another expect to escape with theirs?"" I stuck by this until I started to really look at it later in my teenage life and realised that the argument is actually self defeating. By that line of argument, then the executioner himself has become a killer.

Of course, this is only one line of attack against the death penalty. Personally I see it as barbaric to take the life of anyone and state-sanctioned killing is equally disturbing. 

There's also the very real danger of killing an innocent person, no matter how many safeguards are put into place the system would never be infallible.

I have read certain cases in America where men on death row have been waiting for years for a murder committed in teenage years. Now murder is murder, I am not for one moment suggesting people should not be punished but I can't help thinking that at least some of these people are waiting to die because of a juvenile split-second decision based on extreme passion and misguided principles. A trigger takes less than a second to pull and with it kill someone. Again, this is personal feeling and I'm sure there are plenty of people out there that will disagree with this sentiment but I can't help feeling that killing someone for this moment of extremely bad judgment is wrong.

Ted Heath, the Conservative Prime Minister had very strong opinions on the death penalty, making fine speeches in Parliament opposing it. This opinion was forged when as a serving soldier during the war he was put in charge of a firing squad to execute a soldier who had committed rape and murder. I think that this is a very fine and experienced example to take from.

For the record a recent petition to gov. to re-establish it attracted loads of media attention but another petition calling for it to remain banned which had at least twice as many signatories got barely any attention.  

A bit of History. 

The death penalty in the UK was banned partially because of the case of the wrongful hanging of Timothy Evans. He was accused of the murder of his wife and child and the real murderer, serial killer John Christie, testified against him as a witness for the prosecution. Christie was then later convicted of another murder and it became apparent that an innocent man had been hanged. This wasn't the only case of wrongful conviction but it was the one that most shocked people.

Another thing to add:

The death penalty is now totally banned in the UK, up until 1997 it was theoretically applicable for high treason and a few other obscure crimes, though never used, but in '97 labour signed the UK up to the European convention on human rights (which is not a product of the EU but of the council of Europe of which Churchill was a founding father, but try telling the Conservative right that now)

Unfortunately, because the blade locks into place, if ever Police did take an interest you could end up in trouble.

This is worth a read:

I suppose the most sensible option would be a non-locking Leatherman. I've got a tiny Leatherman Squirt PS4 on my keys that I adore, but you'll probably want something a bit larger! Perhaps the 'Wave'.
Just avoid the Leathermans which use plastic parts in the body.

But in my defence, I play at least an hour or two every day and my last one was close to 15 years old.  Took me a while to save up the money, but I'd rather have something when I can afford it than get something on credit. 

I'm slightly jealous of you guitarists though... not just because your instrument are that much cheaper, but also the portability.  I wish I could drag a piano down to the park to bang out a few tunes on a summer's day  :-)

Every other (modern, not seen all the classics yet) companion has a character arc. Martha goes from having a massive crush on the Doctor to realising that he's never going to return her feelings (because of how much he pines from bloody Rose) and there's also the story of her relationship with her family.

Donna goes from being a temp with little hope for the future and a low self esteem who acts all agressive as a sort of barrier, to realising just how special and important she really is. Then forgets it all.

Amy (in the first series) starts out a child inside, with a childish obsession/crush on the Doctor, the imaginary friend of her childhood, and over the course of the series she matures and realises that her real love is Rory. Her second series is a bit weirder as she totally lacks an appropriate (on-screen) emotional response to discovering River's origin.

I've been called that and worse over the years, and it is pretty damn infuriating.

There is no long term damage.  He took himself off the Mod list (without being asked to do so) - there are several other subreddits where the mods should remove themselves and don't, and we all know it.  He returned the CSS files.  And he has apologized.

My GF deals with these from time to time, it's not a simple process. And AFAIK, next to impossible between different HA's.

Retired people might, if you don't care about jobs then moving to an area which has less jobs but offers you a nicer environment (more rural for instance) might work for you. No idea how many people are in situations like this though, I'm guessing not many. 

&gt; This seems like a way to get people to give up their secured tenure and start on the new 6 monthly review tenure.

Only going to be a problem if you causing problems. For the most part it won't really change anything for the majority of people, but on the occasion where someone moves in and causes nothing but problems it's a very long and involved process to get them out again. It's rare, but it does happen and it causes a lot of problems. 

If they can get different HA's and all the requisite benefits agency's talking to each other and make it easier than it is now, then it might work.

If you have RSI in your wrist, a chiropractic practitioner will crack your spine to fix your chi or some crap and make it go away. It's complete bullshit.


It's just like the wackos who massage your foot or scalp to treat your indigestion. It's pseudoscience masquerading as a real treatment. Some new practitioners have wised up to the fact that their core doctrine is shit and have tried to distance themselves by ignoring all the spiritual stuff their craft is based on. But in the end, they're still applying dangerous and fake medical treatments based on a disproved assumption.


Just because is has the side effect of helping to temporarily alleviate back pain in some people, doesn't mean it's founding principles have any validity, or that they are medical doctors in any way.

Hell, when I was in high school we had an elective English class that I took that was about Science Fiction and Mythology, and we watched a lot of Doctor Who in that class. 

While I thought it was a bit entertaining then and didn't knock it, it just never drew me in much. I would find maybe 3-4 episodes I enjoyed with each of the classic doctors, but found many of them to be uninteresting or just too silly to even be funny.

When the new series came around and started I was only mildly curious about it and didn't give it too much thought. It was not until season 3 that I began to watch it and suddenly realized that I actually LIKED this new Doctor Who, and began watching it from season 1. I found each of the newer Doctors really interesting and fascinating in their own unique way, where as at times the acting of the Doctors that came before was sometimes just too overly pretentious and could annoy occasionally. All of the stories going on in the newer seasons were really exciting and engaging to me. Even the really silly episodes at least got a chuckle out of me or were at least fun to watch and didn't turn me completely off.

The Raspberry Pi is a very exciting project to encourage programming in schools. It has been getting a lot of press in tech circles recently for trying to produce a low cost (£15-£30) board for school children to play about and program on. It was featured on newsnight last week (I posted a link on this subreddit).

Anyway, I think you're better off asking the university you'd like to transfer to.

I know a few people who did transfer but I think they had to do an extra year or so. Good luck!

2) I hope this is addressed in the next season. If not, yes, definitely a plot hole.

It's so perfect. It is specifically referring to Susan in this story, but somewhat unintentionally fulfilling as prophetic a role as any premiere story's title can hope to fullfill - to define the main character.

After all, with nearly 50 years behind him now, what is The Doctor if not a child? An Unearthly child at that?

Even aside from it's thematic implications, the sentence ""An Unearthly Child"" is gorgeous. I don't know the correct words here, but it has great mouthfeel, a sofly gentle ring to it. It's very poetic.

On a wider thematic note, it also sets up the broad tone of the show - mystery, alien-ness, wonder.

For example someone born in 2000 who lives until 2010 then goes back to 1800, at this point the person would be 10, they then live in 1800 for 5 years (until 1805) and go back to 2010, the person would now be 15, even though in 2010 only 10 earth relative years have gone by since they where born.",0,1318823767,null,0,false,0,c2s2vvr,t3_le11t,t1_c2s2vvr,t1_c2s299v,1427741938,2,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,2

It's a tough trade off...on one hand we might be more solid in the middle but we pay for it with poor defense on the wing and less creativity and possession. Luka can pretty much play anywhere in midfield and do well but his best position is undoubtedly a deep-lying playmaker.

Others are incapable of rehabilitation either because of an incurable sickness of the brain (mad) or an irredeemable wickedness/asociality of the mind (bad).  These last need to be held indefinitely in the absence of the ability to outlaw/exile them.

I'm not sure how much that answers your question, but I'm definitely in favour of humane prisons, albeit this always needs to be balanced against the need to do proper justice to the victims of crime and their families.

I get what you mean too about there rarely being a mention of any pre-nine doctors, it is scarce and you just cannot write off all those years of back story and history on the doctor either. 

I know for my cousin Chris, I started getting her into the new series with me, and when I made a few mentions of the original series, she had no idea it ever existed. She has gone back to watch a bit of it, and shes actually getting quite into it, much more so than I did. So it doesn't hurt to remind people every now and then and let people know about the previous show and where it all got started, because some people may just not be aware of it and they may end up loving it too.

My response was mainly just to say not everyone ignores them or just writes them off for the hell of it, I did try to get into the original years ago and it just didn't work out. :)

true,abw,cnty-uk,Surrey,"&gt; I've said it before on here in that I wish our schooling system would do something off the beaten track of Office and Windows courses

Me too.  I asked the IT teacher at my kids school about this and she just recited parrot fashion about how kids need to learn the technology used in business which is overwhelmingly Microsoft Word, etc., etc.

At the heart of the problem is the fact that Microsoft invested a huge amount of money in ""persuading"" the government to mandate Windows as the standard operating system for school and to base the curriculum around MS products (known as the [Microsoft Memorandum of Understanding](http://www.education.gov.uk/schools/adminandfinance/procurement/b0069801/buying/ict/microsoft-licensing-for-schools/how-does-the-microsoft-mou-work)).  Schools pay a huge amount of money to MS in licence fees *every year* and they are required to buy licences for Windows and the Office suite for every PC that they have.  So even if they got cheap PCs and installed Linux on every one, they still have to pay the MS tax on each machine.

From http://www.education.gov.uk/schools/adminandfinance/procurement/b0069801/buying/ict/microsoft-licensing-for-schools/what-are-the-licensing-options/school-agreement :

&gt; The software is licensed on an annual basis with the costs being calculated based on a yearly count of the number of computers in the school above a set specification.

[BECTA](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Becta) (British Educational Communications and Technology Agency) were a non-departmental government body (aka ""quango"") who supported the idea of schools moving towards cheaper, non-MS IT solutions ([Microsoft Tax On Linux Must End Says BECTA](http://blogs.computerworlduk.com/enterprise-os-how-hard-can-it-be/2008/03/microsoft-tax-on-linux-in-schools-must-end-says-becta/index.htm
)).  But BECTA has since been abolished and IT policy for education is now ""safely"" back in the hands of the Department of Education.

The second reason for the downvote is that prison punishes by forceably removing the person from normal society, from their loved ones and social circle.

It is interesting but short stretches actually do better than longer ones. For the shorter periods of time it scares people.

In short prison grows on people. The crowd in prison becomes their crowd and the fear factor is broken.

The thing with Norwegian prisons is they are completely different to UK ones. They focus almost purely on rehabilitation. They don't have freedom to leave the place but the prisons aren't set up to be as difficult and abnormal as possible as we do in the UK. Sentencing is much shorter.

I am also against the death penalty, but I don't think that the following should be used as arguments against capital punishment as part of penal policy:

* The evidence that it makes victims' families feel better is poor at best

* The State is too keen on killing already, I wish to give it no further license to do so;

* The evidence is that it is actually more expensive than life imprisonment (given exhaustive appeals);

* The evidence that there are significant numbers of faulty convictions in our judicial system for crimes which may/would have resulted in death penalties, as well as the many unsatisfactory (by UK standards) executions in the US;

* For rape/child abuse, the likelihood that a death penalty would result in criminals killing their victims rather than leaving living witnesses since they are aware they already face a death sentence.

Indeed, since you are anti-capital punishment you can use those arguments to support your stance. However, I feel that some of those issues are either somewhat irrelevant or are caused by flaws elsewhere, such as with courts and wider criminal justice system, and thus are not truly criticisms of capital punishment.

Just on your last point, I honestly do not agree that it is self-evident at all. The premise of this argument is that someone who is capable of sexually gratifying themselves using children is equally capable of murder.

I did laugh out loud. Churches and church goers have enjoyed enormous privilege in the UK for generations. Various religious organisations, particularly Christian, have often had a certain level of clout on local councils or committees. Most mayors have a Christian chaplain hanging around doing various things. edit - in fact [mapryan makes the point here about representations being made to the council.](http://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/lewal/free_parking_for_woking_church_goers_challenged/c2s4xhk)

(*I started on this list before I realised that you probably weren't asking about privileges in particular, but I'll leave this here for anyone else if they wonder about the NSS causing fusses over nothing:*)

It is only in the last few years and decades that, I think, pressure has really been exerted. To give you an idea of how religious privilege is being challenged at the moment (or recent past) consider a few campaigns by the NSS:

* Freedom of Information requests revealed that the NHS spends in excess of £29m on hospital chaplains. Public money paying for workers performing religious duties. (note: the NSS has nothing against such people being on the staff but argue that the religious institutions they are affiliated with should pay, not the public)
* (legal) challenges are being made to local councils around the country that begin their meetings with Christian prayers. Such prayers are not inclusive and by their nature exclude non-religious (and differently religious) councillors and members of the public.
* Freedom of Information requests revealed that local councils were often spending hundreds of thousands of pounds subsidising travel to school for faith school attendees. This discretionary policy meant that parents who wanted their child to go to a faith school that was further away than their nearest (non or different faith) school had their transport fees covered by the council. Note: In general (I know of one exception) this privilege was not afforded to *non* faith school attendees or non-religious children. *i.e. Johnny and Billy live next door to each other. Johnny's parents are Catholic and want him to go to St Mary's which is 4 miles further away than their nearest (non faith) school: Bash Street School. The council pays for Johnny's bus pass each year to get him to St Mary's. Billy's parents don't have any religion but want him to go to St Mary's because of its reputation and it is where Billy's Mum went. The council does not pay for Billy's bus.*     
The amount being spent across the country varies from a tens of thousands to millions of pounds in the different councils. I think that nearly every council is now reviewing their policy due to budget cuts but also because of the NSS raising the issue. Many have halted the funding for new pupils. When they first brought it up, the NSS received angry responses from some councils who accused them of making up numbers: they didn't even know how much they were spending!

That's a short list, but there's [much more detail on the NSS website.](http://www.secularism.org.uk/campaigns.html)

The NSS works towards ensuring that everyone is treated the same regardless of races, skin colour, sex, sexuality and religious beliefs or lack of. I would say (backed up by stats I can't find the link to right this moment) that most people in the UK are secularists - even the large number of people who are (culturally) Christians agree with the tenants of secularism. There are plenty of religious people who would call themselves secularists if asked.

This particular case, like so many others, is highlighting the financial privilege afforded to a religious groups for no good reason. Effectively people who do not have a religion are being penalised here. Before anyone says that ""It's Sunday - the day when Christians go to church"" - [remember that the Church of England stopped recording ""Sunday Worshippers"" as their way of counting church attendees because people go during the week too](http://www.churchsociety.org/issues_new/church/stats/iss_church_stats_attendance.asp) (and of course it meant that their weekly numbers were higher than just the Sunday numbers, which went well below 1million years ago. They now seem to be counting ""monthly attendance"" but that's another story and related to their dropping numbers). For more info on campaigns highlighting financial benefits given to religious groups see [details on the NSS website here.](http://www.secularism.org.uk/campaigns.html)

Also, it's worth considering that these worshippers are unlikely to just go straight home after church. They're going to be normal families who will combine trips - who doesn't? No doubt many will do a shop after they've been to church. How many of them will pay for the time they were parked when they weren't in church but were in the shops like all the other people who forked out to the ticket machine?

It's not dickish to treat everyone the same. If I was attending a sporting event or a club, or even the local secular group on that day, then I would have to pay to park.

true,teafaceisming,eu,Derby,"I personally went to a state school which was very good in my area and the local private schools (3 of them) were either matching in the quality of teaching or much worse.

I think you should look into what your options in your area are. Also it is not like a 100% if you send them to a private school they are going to be successful but there is that profit incentive to get the grades to impress the parents, keeping the fee's.

Saying that as in my case the incentive may be rooted in a state school to perform as well as possible, we had a very enthusiastic head master and head of sixth form. I'm pretty sure the government scheme has changed with the change of government but there used to be incentive to perform better to get better facilities. (don't quote me on that though)

On the note of personalties I wouldn't say it is stereotyping to say there will be some snobbery and imo especially females are much nastier to other females at private school. If there is a problem between them it will get nasty, lots of female friends that have dropped out of private schools for this reason and moved to state schools and are much happier.

The bullying is usually of a different caliber in state schools, but sometimes it can be a good life lesson to know how different people in vastly different circumstances interact.

In the end it is up to the child how they do in school. It can be up to you to encourage them to be more independant and determined too though not forced. I think anyone can succeed either way.

true,Ivashkin,null,null,"&gt; There used to be issues with transferring between HAs, because most only kept internal swap lists. Now though, most of it happens here now: http://www.homeswapper.co.uk/
&gt; 
&gt; There are issues with planning that I have come across. A lot of HAs own houses that require the person to have local connections, so moving is made pretty difficult. That is likely to affect people living in rural areas imo.

From the rather brief overview the article provides, they are probably wanting to remove the part about having local connections. For some people that might be important, but for others not so much. But then I don't have any local connections anywhere due to moving around, so I'm one of those faceless commuter types who only spends his evenings and weekends in my local area.

Now I'm spending more time working with one of the local HA's I am starting to see a different side to this, dealing with people who are heavily rooted in one area, have never lived anywhere else and don't even have internet access. It's an alien experience tbh, I have more in common with people living on different continents who don't speak English as a first language than I do with people living less than a mile from me.

&gt; I'm not sure how that relates? I was referring to the replacement of the current long-term secure tenancy agreements with 6 month short-term tenancies. The new short-term ones are given to any new tenants, but existing tenants stay on the old system. Swapping your house would mean giving up tenancy though, so both parties would be forced into the new system.

It's only really going to be an issue if you cause problems, such as ASB issues or serious arrears issues. If you don't cause ASB issues, and you don't go into arrears then it's unlikely you will have a problem with your contract regardless of you being on a 6 month review contract or a long term secured contract.

However, I do feel that the society's involvement in this incident is unfortunate, for a couple of reasons.

Firstly, as others have mentioned, this does smack slightly of pettiness and quibbling. The amounts involved aren't huge and I'm not really convinced by all of these quasi-economical arguments being put forward.

Secondly, there's an assumption running throughout on the part of the NSS that shopping/sporting events/clubs and worship are equivalent activities. I'd imagine that you'd argue that they are, given your last line about religion being a choice, but I think things are slightly trickier than that. Undoubtedly, as you point out, there will be worshippers who combine the two, which makes things messier still.

I really feel that secularism is making the progress it deserves to make against religion, but I think we have to be very careful about the battles we choose to fight. Trying to move people along or redraw societal values takes a long time and trying to hurry the process along can sometimes blow up in your face. There's a real danger of playing into the 'political correctness gone mad!' commentators with situations like this.

Committing resources to a campaign like this isn't necessary. The issue will be resolved within a few decades anyway because, as you point out, church attendance is dropping so rapidly.

true,TheMemo,cnty-uk,Bristol,"Having been to private schools in Bristol during the 90s, I'm not sure I would recommend it (though, as they say, your mileage may vary - and my experiences are no longer up-to-date).

A private school will push your children harder than a state school - 4 or more hours of homework after a 10 hour school day was not uncommon. We were also required to attend school on Saturdays. Your children may mix with people who are useful to know later in life - but that sort of networking is better left to the stronger shared bonds of university life, it shouldn't be a consideration here. Many of the people I went to school with were rich, but plenty were not (scholarship students). Nonetheless, the chances of mixing with a diverse group of people is quite slim - I think we only had one black student and a couple of Indian students in the entire school. We had far more racist white South Africans who refused to even be in the same classes as the black kid. 

Bear in mind that in a private school, none of the teachers are required to have any sort of degree or teaching qualification. Although they are examined semi-regularly by OFSTED, the requirements for teachers in private institutions is considerably more lax. The schools I went to, for instance, had a high percentage of teachers from the Army. They were not the most stable of individuals, and were frequently violent with the students. I remember a new student (of around 11 years of age) had blundered into our class by mistake and our History teacher, apoplectic at the interruption, picked him up by the neck and threw him against the wall. This sort of abuse was not uncommon. Mind you, it was better than the uncomfortably eager interest that the Theatre Manager had for young boys.

Private schools are not the most forward-looking of institutions. I was told on many occasions that, as I was a bright lad, I should concentrate on traditional subjects rather than spending so much time with computers. They were, after all, 'just a fad' with no real future. At the time, I had to teach myself any computing &amp; programming skills as the school offered nothing in the way of GCSEs or A-Levels for such. Oddly, my primary school in the 80s was more technologically advanced than any of the private schools in Bristol in the 90s.

Ultimately, my schools left me well-educated but with a life-long distrust of any formal education system. I left at 16 and went to state college for my A-Levels where, sure enough, the teachers were nicer but less effective and the students were often dumb as bricks (at least in an academic sense), but I gained decent social and life skills by virtue of mixing with a diverse and interesting mix of people. 

Ultimately, while a private school will often offer a very good education, it will not offer a well-rounded experience of life, it is much more likely to be a traditional education that will not countenance modern extra-curricular interests regardless of their potential for your child's future, and - at worst - will leave your child an embittered autodidact whose only goal is to remove him- or her- self from the education system permanently.  A poor experience in state school can be difficult but fixable, a poor experience in an institution that your parents are paying for can place a lot of pressure on young shoulders to deal with things that no child should have to deal with. Do not assume that your child will come to you with any problems, they will be acutely aware of the money you have paid for their education and will certainly feel pressure not to come to you with any issues, especially since the teachers will use 'do not disappoint your parents, do you know how much money they have paid for your education?' as a frequent stick to beat your children with.",0,1318862648,null,0,false,0,c2s5u9s,t3_lf2w1,t1_c2s5u9s,t3_lf2w1,1427743402,9,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,9

You have two sides, one out in the field and one in. Each man that's in the side that's in goes out, and when he's out he comes in and the next man goes in until he's out. 

When they are all out, the side that's out comes in and the side that's been in goes out and tries to get those coming in, out. Sometimes you get men still in and not out.

When a man goes out to go in, the men who are out try to get him out, and when he is out he goes in and the next man in goes out and goes in. 

There are two men called umpires who stay out all the time and they decide when the men who are in are out.

When both sides have been in and all the men have been out, and both sides have been out twice after all the men have been in, including those who are not out, that is the end of the game.

true,widgetas,null,null,"I understand where you're coming from, but I don't think the society takes on frivolous activities or does anything vindictively. This particular campaign would go to the very heart of, essentially, religious discrimination. This isn't the only case where church goers are given/after special treatment specifically over parking: Chichester Christians want to keep their free parking now that Sunday tariffs are on the cards and Westminster Council had a consultation in July/August and were lobbied by the Archbishop of Westminster and others to allow church goers exemption etc.

There are [also exemptions for some mosques](http://mobile.pistonheads.com/gassing/topic.asp?h=0&amp;t=839210&amp;d=0&amp;nmt=) on Friday afternoons. Link is one example, but there are apparently others.

When the NSS highlights a particular case, it is invariably not the only example to be had.

&gt; Firstly, as others have mentioned, this does smack slightly of pettiness and quibbling

Unfortunately that is the argument given against pretty much everything the NSS do by people who have a vested interest in keeping things as they are. Listen to any interview on say BBC local radio or even national when the NSS are on talking about a campaign. They will have someone on the opposition who is in favour of keeping whatever is under discussion and will accuse the NSS of being at ""war with religion"" etc. or being petty minded and spoiling things for others.

&gt; Secondly, there's an assumption running throughout on the part of the NSS that shopping/sporting events/clubs and worship are equivalent activities.

Whether or not the NSS thinks that isn't really an issue. What they are doing is highlighting that the Council is making religion out to be something *special* when really it should be saying nothing of the kind. National and local government should say nothing about religion, particularly in so far as treating it differently to any other group of people as a matter of course. But on the subject of sport, I will guarantee that there are more people 'devoted' to football and spend more time taking part in activities etc. than there are people who attend church every week. I believe that so emphatically that I haven't checked the numbers! I will do so at some point - feel free to correct me if you find otherwise. So given the almost 'religious' nature of football 'worship', you could agree that football attendees shouldn't have to pay for parking. If not, why not? Why is a specific kind of activity protected in this way?

&gt;  Trying to move people along or redraw societal values takes a long time and trying to hurry the process along can sometimes blow up in your face. 

Again, this is just asking everyone to pay to park in a carpark. It's not actively preventing people from worshipping, or would the NSS want to do that. Let's start from the other direction: Say the car park was already there and a new church opened next door to it and they worshipped on a Wednesday. Would you agree that it is fair for the new church goers to have free parking? If so - why exactly? What is it about it being a church that means it gets special treatment?

&gt;  The issue will be resolved within a few decades anyway because, as you point out, church attendance is dropping so rapidly...I think it's probably necessary to forgo intervention in this sort of incident to concentrate on the longer term work.

You can say that about anything, but meanwhile councils are seriously underfunded and can't afford to lose money by allowing special treatment on a whim. Some might argue that council prayers aren't really important because it's only a few minutes before the meetings and it's not really hurting anyone, but is it the *principle* of the thing.

true,specofdust,scot-Highlands,Pasty Faced Haggis Rider,"&gt;Killing is morally wrong, whoever does it, in all circumstances but self-defence

I would agree, except that locking someone up seems morally wrong to me too, except if you agree that rights violating acts negate ones own rights, in which case killing seems to stop being morally objectionable.

&gt;The evidence that it makes victims' families feel better is poor at best;

Perhaps so, but should punishment really be about the victims, or should it be about society?

&gt;The evidence that it acts as a deterrent is poor at best;

Well, kind of. While obviously it would never happen, the death penalty as a punishment for speeding or littering would be utterly effective at preventing these things. Few people commit serious crime with the intention of being caught though, so for serious crime the death penalty isn't very effective, I agree.

&gt;The evidence is that it is actually more expensive than life imprisonment (given exhaustive appeals);

That's a product of legal systems, not something intrinsic to the death penalty.

&gt;The evidence that there are significant numbers of faulty convictions in our judicial system for crimes which may/would have resulted in death penalties

Yes but so what? We argue that this it is a terrible thing to execute a person for a crime they did not convict, and of course it **is** a terrible thing. Then again, people only have a certain amount of years left when we stick them in jail. With or without the death penalty, the punishment for serious crime is to have a part of your life taken away which we can never give back. Whether that's 10%, 80%, or 100% of your remaining time seems worse only by the length of time one loses, not by the way one loses that time.

(In short, to me it seems better to wrongly execute a 60 year old who would live to 80, than to wrongly jail a 20 year old man until he's 60.)

&gt;The lack of a humane method of execution

Besides the inevitable question of whether we care that punishment is humane, there are plenty of ways of reliably killing a person without them feeling it.

Further to that, for some people, a quick death will be far more humane than having to live in a prison for the entirity of the remainder of their natural life.

&gt;For rape/child abuse, the likelihood that a death penalty would result in criminals killing their victims rather than leaving living witnesses since they are aware they already face a death sentence.

I doubt that's likely.Most if not all people committing these crimes aren't expecting to be jailed, otherwise they wouldn't commit them, because the punishment they receive in jail is bloody awful, and a fair old number of them get injured or die in some manner or other while in the clink.

I'm not especially *for* the death penalty, I just think that to make some huge distinction between long term imprisonment and death is morally fallacious. Furthermore to use the argument of ""What if we get it wrong?"" is pointless. We do get it wrong, that doesn't stop us carrying out justice, and it shouldn't stop us with the death penalty.

true,JennyCide,uk,"Leeds, Leeds, Leeds","I spent 7 years of my life at a fee paying grammar school and then, later in life, worked for 10 years in a rough inner city school so I've seen both sides.

FWIW my kids go to state schools - even if I could afford it I wouldn't send them to fee-paying schools but I don't think worse, or are jealous of, people who do send their kids to private schools.

In my experience the biggest difference is facilities and opportunities to try different experiences.  Private schools don't have to bus students to a public swimming pool for an unruly swimming class, they have more trips away, abroad, school camps, theatre trips etc.  They tend to play more sport as well and have more inter-school competitions.  Teaching in the more esoteric subjects is a lot higher (I did 5 years of Latin and Ancient Greek and another couple of Ancient History which I loved but hasn't helped me later in life apart from understanding Stephen Fry and Asterix better).

State schools are as good as you want them to be.  Most of the best teachers are in state schools because they are still passionate about teaching and will do anything to help students who want to learn.  Low ability children are given as much help as they require and so called 'gifted and talented' children are well supported too but often the middling students are not given the attention they require.  In public schools the low ability students are not helped in my experience, the average students just chug along but the cleverer pupils thrive due to the opportunities and freedoms.

Overall, the most important thing is what you as a parent can bring - if you can bring up a polite, enthusiastic child then there is no need for private education, they will want to learn and can do this at any school.  You will have to provide trips to interesting places or additional opportunities if they want to learn non-standard things (for example, I hated football, rugby and cricket but I had the chance to play hockey, swim a lot, learn archery).

tl:dr save your money and spend it on bringing up a child who is interested in learning by giving them the opportunities yourself instead of relying on a school to bring up your child.",0,1318864642,null,0,false,0,c2s62ab,t3_lf2w1,t1_c2s62ab,t3_lf2w1,1427743516,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

The work the NSS does is in ensuring everyone is treated the same regardless of personal, racial, sexual or religious differences. To that end, my statement stands.

&gt; They're quite clearly not protecting the interests of people worshipping at the church. 

Forgive my dismissal but this is looking at the situation in entirely the wrong way. It would be the equivalent of saying feminism is not about equality between the sexes because it removes the privileges that men enjoy: It is not protecting the interests of men who have a disproportionate level of power.

&gt; They're representing secularist interests, which do not automatically imply equality, but the removal of religious rights.

Yes, obviously, but only if those religious rights are discriminatory. It is a common misconception, spread by religious people, that secularism will result in persecution of religious groups. That is not the case, unless the religious groups are being discriminatory, in which case the NSS will only work to stamp out those instances.

You will have heard in the last few years about the ""secularist's war on Christianity"". Essentially the argument boils down to (some) Christians not wanting to comply with the equality laws i.e. in the main they do not want to give homosexuals the rights afforded to them by law. These people are basically saying: You are persecuting me by not allowing me to persecute.

An analogy would be a racist crying foul because  he is being made to treat a black person the same way he would treat a white person.

To rewrite your above sentence: *""They're representing **multicultural** interests, which do not automatically imply equality, but the removal of **white** rights.""*

I'm not trying to imply you or anyone else is racist, but just demonstrating how that line of argumentation is flawed. Religious people should have their rights, yes, but no more than anyone else and only up until they start to impinge on the rights of others. At the moment, however, religions do get to discriminate on a number of grounds including sexuality. The clause was written into the Equality bill a few years ago. The NSS is working to have that corrected.

&gt; but it seems to me that there's a whole load of more important things they could do

But... the NSS does many things. This isn't the *only* thing they're doing. I've seen this mentality quite a bit recently about various topics recently: Just because they have a position concerning this particular issue doesn't mean they're not working elsewhere. Also the NSS is not simply a group of a few people in London. True they only have a handful of people who take a wage, but *much* of the research is done by members acting for no money all over the country. My own local group and others across the country have put in Freedom of Information requests and gathered statistics for large campaigns you will have heard of. Consider the [Hospital Chaplains](http://www.secularism.org.uk/nhs-chaplaincy-funding.html) or the [Transport for Schools](http://www.secularism.org.uk/nss-intervenes-in-school-transpo.html) campaigns: those two campaigns were conducted by only a few people, and the latter was carried on by two friends of mine acting alone. Not paid work, but completely voluntary in their own time.

Finally - Who decides what is important and what isn't? My own pet project at the moment is finding out whether or not Humanism and/or Secularism is being taught in schools on the RE Curriculum around the country. Is that important in the grand scheme of things? It depends on your view point. Personally I find that, with the number of faith run schools in the country being at 1 in 3 and RE is essentially what a school wants it to be, is that no core standard for RE is a bad thing. In many cases RE is teaching **one** particular religion rather than teaching **about** all religions, philosophies and world views. But when you compare it to religious privilege in government or the fact that (male) circumcision is still legal, it is a trivial matter. We can't all work on the big issues and it is very important that people take the smaller challenges too.

true,widgetas,null,null,"&gt; Despite never really being involved with the church, I've always recognised it as having a certain level of esteem and privilege. The rationalist in me recognises that this isn't really fair or sustainable, but there's still an attachment there.

You were taught to think that way! But as you say, the rationalist in you recognises it. I've never had a religion, never had a faith and don't believe in anything supernatural, so to me it's all a nonsense and the position religion has had in the past is untenable in my opinion. There's no justification for the privilege. That doesn't mean I think people should be *stopped* from being religious, but it means that I am firmly in favour of their not being given a special status.

Consider the Lords Spiritual who are in the House of Lords specifically because they're CoE. Now remember how few people in the country are actively Church of England believers or attendees. If we were going to be fair and by the numbers, there would be around 50 or more Imams in the Lords. 26 Bishops on the back of only around 1.5million (conservative guess) worshippers would mean that the Muslims with 3+million adherents should have that level of representation.

Suddenly the idea of religious representatives doesn't seem like a good idea. (Note: I say that as a secular atheist humanist, not as an Islamophobe. I just used Islam as an example because I know roughly how many Muslims there are in the UK).

&gt; Again, I completely agree with you

Saying this though, I will be sending my future children to a private school if I can afford it, but it will be a mixed school. There was one case of bullying in the whole school in the 7 years I went there, and the bully ended up getting expelled, although not expelled for bullying, but for letting a boy into the boarding house at night.

The reason you can't get around it by just telling youtube to *actually* compare the videos is they probably use the hash for indexing as well.  Just do what they said - make *any* change to the video, no matter how small, and it will radically change the hash.  Adding a small caption at the start would do.

Anyway, the way you write and ill assume the way you speak is unnecessarily verbose, and frankly a little annoying. Waiting for someone to make a point whilst they flair away with their archaic tone is enraging. Skilled speaking comes from making a point in as few words as possible, whilst being as descriptive as possible.

Also, the use of hyperbole in your speech/writ does not suggest an accomplished vocabulary. Where you opt for longer more 'impressive' sounding words, you are let down. eg.

true,real_moxie,null,null,"&gt; Because she has no character arc. Her character when she runs off with the Doctor is virtually unchanged by the end of the second series. Also she was a total bitch to Mickey and she didn't seem to learn anything from her relationship with him.

I'd argue that she does have a character arc, and imbeingsirius does a good job of explaining it. Also, what would you suggest she learn from her relationship with Mickey? (I do agree that her treatment of him wasn't the best, but he also wouldn't let her go either. As much as he complained about being the 'Tin Dog', he didn't walk away from it.)

&gt; Martha goes from having a massive crush on the Doctor to realising that he's never going to return her feelings (because of how much he pines from bloody Rose) and there's also the story of her relationship with her family.

The story of Martha's relationship with her family wasn't that extraordinarily different than the stories concerning Rose and her family. Also, if the only other thing that can be said about Martha was that she fell in love with the Doctor, and then left because she knew he wouldn't reciprocate the feelings, I'm not sure that could actually be called a character arc. I think it points out more how little she was actually used as a character.

&gt; Donna goes from being a temp with little hope for the future and a low self esteem who acts all agressive as a sort of barrier, to realising just how special and important she really is. Then forgets it all.

I am in total agreement about Donna, the growth she experiences is amazing, and very well written. I would also say that, to a lesser extent, Rose goes through a similar transformation (especially in her first season). I like the idea of the Doctor having companions who learn and grow as individuals because their experiences with him help them discover parts of themselves that, while always there, were also easy to hide/ignore. (Also, I don't think this appeared much for Martha. I think it was attempted with Amy, but better done with Rory.)

&gt; Amy (in the first series) starts out a child inside, with a childish obsession/crush on the Doctor, the imaginary friend of her childhood, and over the course of the series she matures and realises that her real love is Rory. Her second series is a bit weirder as she totally lacks an appropriate (on-screen) emotional response to discovering River's origin.

If I were to make a list of the companions, in order from top to lowest, on how I believe they grew as characters, it would be thus: Donna, Rose, Rory, Amy, Martha. I have yet to figure out what exactly Amy's character development was, and the only reason I have her above Martha is because, again, poor Martha seemed to have no other purpose other than to pine over the Doctor. I see very little of actual development of Amy maturing over her first season (and even in her second season...the whole point of *The God Complex* covered her still totally childish faith in the Doctor.) Out of all the companions though, even Martha, I would still say she is the one who never actually changes. Meanwhile, we actually see Rory go from a man who is totally overshadowed by the Doctor to a man who stands up to the Doctor, who calls him out on making him act like the Doctor when he doesn't want to be that way (*The Girl Who Waited*). 

&gt; But Rose? I liked her character and I liked Billie Piper, but Russel T Davies just didn't do anything interesting with the character besides have her fall in love with the Doctor (and I didn't find his love for her particularly convincing).

Again, I'd mention that what else interesting happened with Martha besides having her fall in love with the Doctor? I read...somewhere on here, that the Doctor's love for Rose grew because she saved him. As 9, he was bitter, depressed, hateful because of the Time War, and Rose essentially picked up him, showed him the good side of life, and saved him. When push came to shove, and he made her leave him to die, she looked into the Time Vortex for him, came back and saved him. She showed him the best side of humanity and gave him a reason to want to enjoy life again. There are theories that part of his nature as 10 was due to the influence of Rose when he was 9. That's why I have no trouble believing the Doctor's love for her. (I do believe it's possible it could have been another companion too...but because he found Rose, that's who it was.)

After thinking a bit, I'm not sure companions should stay longer than a season...I think of lot of their stories seem to be well told within a season. If they stay a second season, it'd be beneficial to include a new companion to the TARDIS.

It should be about both.  I was merely countering one of the standard arguments used to justify the death penalty.

I certainly agree that extra-judicial killing is a very cost effective punishment (price - one bullet, or if you're really stretched - one machete for a few dozen).

We had a 7-hour school day, both days off at weekends and enough free time to have a life outside school.

I don't think there was a teacher there without a university degree or some form of higher education. Most were stable, with the odd exception but that's to be expected, there'll be unstable people everywhere. No overt paedophiles or very violent people though.

We had enough money for 'interactive whiteboards' in every classroom. At one point the maths department put them in classrooms for little reason in a building we were about to leave just because they'd been given the money and didn't know what to do with it. Private schools do concentrate on traditional subjects as a matter of course (media studies and the like were not an option) but many do have the latest (or at least decent) technology.

We had a wealth of extra-curricular activities - choirs which took me on tours to, for example, South Africa; sports teams which frequently played and won against other teams in the region and similarly went abroad; a large-scale school play every year; debating teams; even a chess team.

It is true there was not much diversity. Most of my friends are well-off if not downright rich, most are white; many of the students and their parents did have an over-inflated ego and sense of entitlement.

It does depend on the school, though. Private schools are largely stricter and less diverse but there are definitely benefits. Go and visit whatever school you're thinking of sending them to, ask about the facilities, extra-curricular clubs, maybe a pastoral/welfare system if you're worried.

It was first mentioned in August at which point the NSS asked members for information regarding any such instances. [You can read it here.](http://www.secularism.org.uk/demand-for-religious-parking-pri.html) I have no doubt that if there are several cases like this around the country, and people let them know, then the NSS will make it known to the authorities. There is nothing stopping local people from raising the issue, of course.

&gt; If they did nothing, then I can't help but think the NSS is simply being spiteful towards an easy target

The NSS isn't afraid of calling out Islam if that's what you're worried about. But ""spiteful"": again, why is it ""spiteful""? A group of people who have nothing special about them except that they have one particular specific world view are effectively being subsidised for that belief. By waiving the parking fee the council is saying these people deserve special treatment. And ""easy target"" - that sort of thinking is close to thinking that religious people are being 'persecuted'. Is it fair - yes or no? Will making them pay *stop* them from worshipping? Remember that most churches take a collection each week too. Surely the money that people will pay in the car park is less than they might give to a collection.

true,specofdust,scot-Highlands,Pasty Faced Haggis Rider,"&gt;Would you agree that someone who calls for violence against a particular group, whether they be defined by race or religion, should carry any kind of responsibility in the event that his express wishes are carried out?

No I would not. The person who carries out the ""express wish"" should hold responsibility, no-one else.

&gt;In your view is the incitement to violence only a crime if there is actual violence as a result?

In my view incitement is never immoral. It might be a jerk-move, but it is not immoral. Whether it is a crime or not is a legal matter, and the law is fairly divorced from morality.

&gt;There are plenty of ridiculous restrictions on freedom of expression such as the blasphemy laws but there are also a couple that I happen to agree with. Inciting racial or sectarian hatred is one example.

Exactly, a couple you **happen** to agree with. Blasphemy could be described as inciting religious hatred, because pointing out that there's a group of people who worship an invisible sky-man who wants to kill you if you don't join them in their view might incite hatred against that group. You don't happen to agree with that though, because it doesn't conflict with *you* or *your* beliefs.

Basically anything anyone says can incite others to hate people, because hatred is irrational and dependant on the individuals beliefs, background, personal tendencies, and other random traits. If we start letting judges decide what is and what is not inciting hatred, what we end up with are two catagories of things which can be said: the catagory of things which can be said and it's allowed even though you might offend/inspire hatred, and the catagory of things which can't be said because they might offend/inspire hatred. The people who decide these things will be judges.

true,foxtrottuniform,null,null,"Its really pretty simple. The basic idea is score more points than the other team. 

How do you score points, well you have two teams, at any one time the team, those who are batting and those who are fielding. Fielders also supply the bowler. So the batsman has to hit the ball as it is bowled to him from then on if it rolls over the boundary that scores 4 points if it flies over it, 6 points. Then if he runs down the length of the run (the bit the bowling happens over, it is the distance of 1 chain or 22 yards) he scores 1 point. There is a batsman at either end so that they don't have to make 2 runs which would make point scoring much harder. points are called runs. The score is the innings. 

So if you see something like 136-3 what does that actually mean. That means the batting side have scored 136 runs and have three batsmen out. 

So how do you get out? Well there are a few ways. The first is when the ball is bowled to you if the ball hits the wickets and the bail comes off the top. The wickets being the the wooden things behind the batsman. LBW or Leg before wicket will get a batsman out if he puts his shin in front of the wicket and the umpire (referee) determines that the ball would have hit the wicket if it weren't for his leg. Without this rule one would simple be able to stand in front of the wicket and never get out. Then you can be caught out by any of the fielders. Once the ball has come off the bat if a fielder catches it, and it has to be a catch it can not merely be making contact with it, then the batsman is out. 

About the bowler it is his job to bowl you out, ie hit the wickets and generally make the batsman's life hard. Generally there are two types of bowling, speed or spin. 

Once 10 of the eleven batsmen are out then that innings is over. The teams then swap and do it again. This may happen a certain number of times. However if each side does not get the same number of innings there can be no winner. So for that reason, particularly in test games, you will notice sides ""declaring."" So they may have used 6 batsmen but they declare and opt to swap early because they are gambling the other side will not be able to beat their score on their next innings.

The crowded cinema argument is a remarkably robust argument, however when you shout ""fire"" in a crowded cinema you are not expressing an opinion, which would be the immediately obvious difference between the argument against incitement/hate speech and yelling fire.

Ultimately I can't find problem a moral problem with yelling fire in a crowded theatre beyond it being a lie (unless of course, there is an actual fire).

Obviously true, but there's a quantitative difference.  In any event, I'm not defending imprisonment, I'm condemning the death penalty.

&gt;You should surely agree that different systems of legal processes result in different costs being incurred, and that some systems might be preferable, and even cheaper, than others?

Of course, but the point surely is that the US is the poster boy for a society which is free and fair and just, and even their extensive and expensive appeals procedures result in unjust judicial murders.  Would you really want to establish a death penalty in a less just society which offered even less of a chance for the innocent to be exonerated before their lives were ended by the State?

&gt;I lack scientific reports on the ballistics (because science has ethical limits) but a 30mm shell fired towards the head would kill instantly, failing any mishaps.

I'm assuming this was actually intended as a response to a different comment I made on the pain associated with different ways the State might wish to induce death.  In which case, since you acknowledge mishaps, it obviously isn't always pain-free (and of course, philosophically speaking, you have no means of knowing what happens to perception of time at the instant of death, so quickness alone is no valid measure of pain experienced).  It's also not currently accepted as an appropriate method in any developed society that I know of, if anywhere.  In the US, they are incredibly reluctant to allow death penalty candidates to elect firing squads, what do you imagine the reason for this might be?

&gt;That said, d'you think they would have been happier if they hadn't gone to jail in the first place? 

Of course, I don't see the point you're making.

&gt;Neither is an argument against justice being carried out.

But the difference between a life ending and a life being shortened is the difference between night and day.

The basic rules are easy enough, and can be looked up, so I'm guessing that's not what you don't understand. The key to understanding *any* sport is understanding which person is under pressure at which time. Baseball clicked for me when I finally grokked the extent to which it's all about the pitcher; he is the guy who has to maintain focus and concentration, otherwise he'll give up the hit. The guy with the bat can swing and miss, that's fine he gets another go.

In cricket, it's the batsman who is under pressure. The bowler accepts that he will concede runs and it's OK for him to do that as long as he's creating chances to get the batsman out. But if the batsman makes one mistake, he's gone.

Quantitative, not qualitative, I agree. It's true that you haven't defended imprisonment, but my point is that to argue against the death penalty and be consistent, one should also be arguing against imprisonment.

&gt;Of course, but the point surely is that the US is the poster boy for a society which is free and fair and just, and even their extensive and expensive appeals procedures result in unjust judicial murders.

Very funny.

&gt;Would you really want to establish a death penalty in a less just society which offered even less of a chance for the innocent to be exonerated before their lives were ended by the State?

I can accept the death penalty in a hopefully more just society, although my point is mainly that if you accept imprisonment you should accept the death penalty, they are punishments on a sliding scale, not of a different catagory.

&gt;In the US, they are incredibly reluctant to allow death penalty candidates to elect firing squads, what do you imagine the reason for this might be?

Plenty of reasons. I'm not suggesting firing squad though, I'm suggesting custom designed death machines which propel a 30mm shell along a barrell and your head is placed at the end of that barrel. For reference, a 30mm shell can immobilise a tank. Travelling at say 1000 m/s (a realistic speed) the bullet would take perhaps a total of 0.0002 seconds to turn your head completely to goo. If designed correctly the possibility of the gun firing and the prisoner not dying would be very close to 0.

&gt;Of course, I don't see the point you're making.

They lose life regardless, no prisoner is going to be happy to lose their life wrongly, but that's not an argument against taking life away, that's an argument for making the legal system better.

&gt;But the difference between a life ending and a life being shortened is the difference between night and day.

No, it's the difference between 20 years and 40 years (either can be either though, with punishment).

Of course most people would choose to live longer than not. Most people would choose to only have the state take 20 years of their life and not 40, that shouldn't impact upon our decision to dish out justice, because no one wants to be punished. The point is that if it's OK to take away 60 years of some guys life which we can never give back, then it's ok to take away 5 years of some other guys life which we can never give back, but after which he would have died anyway.",0,1318873287,null,0,false,0,c2s7d4f,t3_le7rm,t1_c2s7d4f,t1_c2s79jv,1427744120,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

For those men whose group of pals has grown to the level where a fishing trip is no longer viable and their sciatica is making hitting a One Wood a chore cricket is the ideal sport.

A gentleman will gather 10 of his close friends, usually regulars at the local real ale pub and will meet of a weekend in July and take on a similar group of fellows from a similar real ale pub in a neighbouring village.  

So we have got Team A; regulars of the quaint CAMRA certified *Old Boot Inn* who have cleverly named themselves ""The Boot'in Arse"" taking on Team B; less creatively titled ""Powell's Boys"" after Bob Powell, Local Antique dealer and team captain. 

The Umpire starts proceedings by tossing a coin, Powell's Boys win the toss and decide that bowling first would be a preferred option. Now this is an important early tactic and a highly astute decision, for reasons that will come apparent later on. 

The Boot'in Arse take to the 'crease' with the challenge to score as man 'runs' as possible within either 50 'overs' or 10 'wickets' (please see our lexicon below for definitions). They score a respectable 170 'All Out' from 48.6 overs.

Now it is time for Powell's to take to the crease; Bob's decision to bat second is beginning to become more clear. When a team bats they only have their two batsmen out at one time, the rest of the team enjoy the real ale and cucumber sandwiches of the pavilion. The bowling team however is forced to have their whole team out 'in the field'. This is the dullest part of the day, you may not have a ball come towards you for hours on end but you must stand, away from the beer, away from the nibbles.... Waiting.

During The Boots 'innings' at bat, a total of 4 hours 22 minutes of cricket was played, not one player was out for more than 51 minutes; and these boys drink fast.

By the time they have taken the field to bowl most the team are already 5-6 pints down which makes 'bowling' and 'fielding' an uncoordinated affair against the comparatively sober Powell's Boys. 

With their star batsman; ex 'county' reserve player Davey Smyth hitting a 'century' 'not out' Powell's boys managed to get to their target score of 171 within 27 overs, whilst only losing 2 wickets- meaning they ""won the match by 8 wickets""

Although spirits were high in the 'pavillion' post game and promises were made for a rematch the summer following these plans never came to fruition after 56 year old Davey Smyth was found with his pans down at a charity fundraiser with Ray Moore's (Boot'in Arse's 'silly point fielder') 17 year old daughter. 
 

**LEXICON**

CREASE: The Oche of cricket

TOSS: a cointoss before the game to decide who bats first

RUNS: A player scores a 'run' if he hits the ball and runs to the other 'stump' or hits the ball out of play (see boundary)

BOUNDARY: When a batsman hits a ball to the fields fence- 4 Runs for getting it this far with bounces. 6 Points for hitting it out of the park without a bounce. 

STUMP: Three wooden sticks with a dowel on top; the target for the bowler and fielder. If the stumps are hit by the a bowl the batman is out, if a fielder hits the stumps whilst the batsman is running between the stumps (in an attempt to score a run) he is also out. 

OVERS: A over is 6 consecutive balls, after each over the bowler switches.

WICKETS: To make a batsman leave the field you need to get him out; doing this is known as a wicket. To achieve this you can either Bowl at the stump (see above), catch one of his hits without it bouncing or get him with an LBW.

LBW: Leg Before Wicket: In cricket the leg cannot be used to defend your stumps. If the ball hits your leg it is the umpires decision as to if the ball was going to hit the stumps, if so then you are given out if not then it is a legal shot. 

BATTING: When your team is batting you have two batsmen out, to switch between the two you either score a run or switch at the end of an over. 

FIELDING: The whole team is out, a bowler will always be bowling, a wicketkeeper (a fielder with gloves that stands behing the wicket) in place with the rest of the team 'fielding'. Attempting to limit the amount of runs scored by returning the ball to the stumps as quickly as possible. 

COUNTY CRICKET: As with above, just with an audience. 

ONE DAY CRICKET: Above is example of a one day match; in one day matches the amount of overs are limited to 50, there are however similar rulesets with varying amounts of overs.

TEST MATCH CRICKET: As with above, but played over 5 days with no maximum number of overs. This is reserved for those with only the most disgusting despicable wives, the sort of wives who would have disgusted Marques de Sade.

I kind of did, somewhere else in this thread.  With the exception of people who present an ongoing threat to society, I find it hard to countenance punitive justice.  With those that do, rehabilitation and/or containment are unavoidable unless we have other options like exiling or outlawing or some (ethically repugnant) sci-fi reprogramming concept.

&gt;I can accept the death penalty in a hopefully more just society

Are we in some sort of Minority Report territory here?

&gt;custom designed death machines which propel a 30mm shell along a barrell and your head is placed at the end of that barrel...If designed correctly the possibility of the gun firing and the prisoner not dying would be very close to 0.

Sure, I appreciated that you were thinking bigger, but what do you think might be the reason this sort of option doesn't currently exist (and recall, in the US, many executions are public).  It's an interesting engineering concept though, not sure it's going to catch on.  There is also, as you appear to concede, the possibility the gun won't fire (which is akin to the trap not opening or the failure to hit the vein or the chair not sparking).

&gt;They lose life regardless, no prisoner is going to be happy to lose their life wrongly, but that's not an argument against taking life away, that's an argument for making the legal system better.

Yes it is, but show me anyone non-suicidal who wouldn't prefer to lose a fraction rather than the entirety of their life.

&gt;No, it's the difference between 20 years and 40 years

It's basically a sport where one side is batting and the other is bowling, similar to baseball, the difference is instead of having three strikes once the ball is caught in the air by a bowling team player or the ball is bowled into the stumps or if it hits the batters leg impeding its progress to the wicket, the batter is out. 

The batter can stay batting for as long as he is not declared out. There are two batters and they run between the stumps, each run is worth a point. 

If the batter hits the ball and it hits the string around the pitch it is called a 'boundary' and is worth 4 points, if the ball goes past the boundary then it is worth 6 points.

The batting team have 11 players and once they are all out the bowling team take to batting. They do the same thing. Once the first batting team have 'declared' as in when they have all their batters out, the second batting team must match or better that score. 

The game can go on for days or hours and many matches are played in test series.

true,DogBotherer,null,null,"I'm sympathetic to the point.  It's very easy to judge in retrospect, very hard to pick up on the way.  Especially since no two fascist governments look the same (they're all nationalist in their own way for example).  Well, okay, let's run through the fourteen features which is one of the more widely accepted definitions and consider:

* Powerful and Continuing Nationalism

Not really got that yet - Britain isn't consumed with nationalism to anything like the extent it would need to be.  We certainly have vocal, visible and aggressive splinter groups like the EDL and BNP, but they're tiny compared to the number of flag-waving ultra nationalists you see in many other nations (not least, the US).  Doesn't mean we should be complaisant about those groups and why they're gaining ground, but they're still completely insignificant compared to any country which could be reasonably called fascist.

* Disdain for the Recognition of Human Rights

We're definitely working very hard on this one now, and there are elements within the current government who are clearly there already.

* Identification of Enemies/Scapegoats as a Unifying Cause

Without doubt we've been there on this one for a decade.

* Supremacy of the Military

Not yet.  There are a contingent of Brits who worship the military in an almost American fashion, but there are many more who don't.  And indeed, currently our military is in very poor shape and stands to be cut back further.  I don't honestly think our military is a fearfully oppressive thing (domestically) at this time, though their actions on behalf of our corrupt political and business class overseas are another matter.

* Rampant Sexism

Don't see it myself, but as a man I don't think I'm really the right person to ask.

* Controlled Mass Media

Definitively; and the hacking scandal is being used as an excuse to further corporatise and control the media.

* Obsession with National Security

Indubitably.

* Religion and Government are Intertwined

Not so much currently, but definitely increasing.  The US religious right are spending shitloads to bring evangelical/charismatic Christianity to our ostensively atheist nation, and they're pressing hard in all the obvious places.  Other religious groups are holding out for a share too.

* Corporate Power is Protected

Without the faintest fucking shadow of a doubt.  That one was bagged a long time ago.

* Labor Power is Suppressed

Yup, again, covered off long since.

* Disdain for Intellectuals and the Arts

Strongly promoted by parts of the press and fairly widely disseminated by this point (part of the US Hollywood blockbuster baggage too).

* Obsession with Crime and Punishment

Again, strongly promoted in the corporate press and widely consumed and regurgitated by a large section of the community.

* Rampant Cronyism and Corruption

Probably definitive at present.  The UK is more corrupt and crony-friendly today than at any time in my life time(and yes, this is partly about exposure).

* Fraudulent Elections

Hmm.  Worthless ineffectual elections certainly, and there are some iffy rumours, but we've not exposed similar levels of electoral fraud as in the US yet.  Having said that, the registration of voters issue currently ongoing is definitely a step in the wrong direction in this regard.




So, on balance, we're not there yet, but we're well on the way as I said.  And, of course, once we do arrive at our authoritarian destination, it's likely to be too late to do much about it!

Along with this, his work rate is a lot higher than in previous seasons. For me, though, he was a little selfish in the aformentioned instance which thafman brought up and I also felt that Kaboul's performance today overshadowed all of our lads out there.

I'll also second you the latter point. I felt that Bale had a shocking game, he needs to stick to what he's good at (bombing it down the left) rather than thinking he's Messi and trying to dribble it through the middle, because he simply doesn't have the flair or balance for it.

I really missed Modric in the centre. I think it really shows exactly why we need him in the centre when you see him out on the wing. He completely controls the middle of the pitch and gets a lot more time on the ball. He looked rather lost out on the right, as well as lacking the defensive capabilities we desperately needed. 

Once again, I will stress my point that I believe we need Walker on the right wing with Corluka (when fit) slotting in at right back. Although some may find this strategy to be unconventional, I think the work rate on the right side this would bring would be second-to-none. The only problem is keeping VDV happy.

Despite the school looking modern enough during the 'open days,' (where parents were only shown the newer wings or the opulent public areas) as students we were taught in decrepit rooms with no heating and bars on the windows. The school seemed to believe in the Victorian / Galton ideal that schools should force children to disconnect from the outside world by making their surroundings as horrible as possible, and encourage social darwinism.

&gt; Private schools do concentrate on traditional subjects

Indeed. However, at the time (1992 - 1997) computing was considered, as I said, 'a fad' and no facilities were available except for an Amiga with Deluxe Paint in the Art block. This was not helpful in setting up students for a life dominated (even then) by computers. Though, to be honest, it was assumed that we would all either have servants to do such things for us, or be officers in the Army.

&gt; They may well feel pressured to succeed because of the money you're pouring into this, but teachers did not use this as a stick to beat the less bright students with, only those who were misbehaving persistently.

In my experience, it wasn't those who misbehaved who were beaten with this stick, but those who were abused - either by teachers or by fellow students. It was a weapon used to stop any problems escalating to parents. The school would try to deal with this internally, outside of school hours, and encourage us to lie to our parents while we went to 'counselling' (which we were to describe as a sporting activity).",0,1318882039,null,0,false,0,c2s8s4h,t3_lf2w1,t1_c2s8s4h,t1_c2s6s95,1427744787,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

This really nails the importance of the relativistic perspective when confronted with protests and well-sold idealistic causes.

The bankers that walk past during rush hour have families, mortgages to pay, and lives to live. Some of them could be called greedy, although again that's all a matter of perspective. While it's easy to say that having two porches is excessive and greedy it's not so easy to condemn a banker who is trying to support his family and isn't necessarily a cold-blooded spawn of satan.

I visited the OccupyLSX protest earlier tonight, and although it is somewhat organised, it is a kind of organised chaos, in that the participants' causes probably don't fully align, and thus a coherent message isn't being put across.

With the exception of people who present an ongoing threat to society, I find it hard to countenance punitive justice. With those that do, rehabilitation and/or containment are unavoidable unless we have other options like exiling or outlawing or some (ethically repugnant) sci-fi reprogramming concept.

I basically agree. Some people can be rehabilitated, and they should be, instead of being sent to prisons as they are now. Others can not (violent paedophiles and psychopaths, for instance), and so should basically be quarantined for the rest of their lives.

&gt;Are we in some sort of Minority Report territory here?

I was just observing that the criminal justice system isn't perfect, and I would like to see it improved.

&gt;Sure, I appreciated that you were thinking bigger, but what do you think might be the reason this sort of option doesn't currently exist

A whole bunch of reasons, mostly including the fact that it would liquify about 50-75% of the person's body on impact. It's not pretty, so we're not interested. What it is, is humane. They wouldn't even hear the trigger click.

&gt;There is also, as you appear to concede, the possibility the gun won't fire

Different from an electrical chair malfunctioning. If a chair goes wonky, someone might be subject to a lower than normal but still extremely painful current. If the gun goes wonky, it doesn't fire and the person just lives another day. If it does function, the person is going to die basically instantly, no question.

&gt;Yes it is, but show me anyone non-suicidal who wouldn't prefer to lose a fraction rather than the entirety of their life.

Missing the point, what criminals want is not important. No criminal wants to go to jail, that doesn't stop us putting them there. The point is what is right and moral in terms of punishment, and what I'm arguing is that jailing people is quantitatively  less severe than killing people, in some cases, but qualitatively not different at all.

&gt;Also the difference, once the appeals are up, between now and sometime in the future (which is kind of critical). As well as by the State's hand rather than by biology's/God's/fate's.

Yes and no. On the one hand this allows some relief in the case of a bad decision, on the other hand, you can get situations where a man of 20 is jailed for 40 years, and a man of 60 is executed and loses 10 years, and yet we say that the former is preferable to the latter,when from a philosophical and moral perspective it's the other way around.",0,1318890149,null,0,false,0,c2s9zkp,t3_le7rm,t1_c2s9zkp,t1_c2s7j9m,1427745361,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

2. No matter how much you may wish it to be the case, the franchise is not nearly as ubiquitous in its pop culture impact as Star Wars is.  In fact, Darth Vader being Luke's father is probably the most famous spoiler in pop-culture history along with Rosebud in Citizen Kane.

3. As you pointed out, the book is 15 years old but the show is much, much newer.  It's only been about 4 months since the season finale aired.

It's new to LOTS OF PEOPLE now.  Guess what, Lord of the Rings was new to lots of people too when the movies came out.  Did YOU read it in 1954?  I'm sure you read it before the movies came out, but my point still stands.  People are being introduced to LotR/ASoIaF/GoT now more than ever (sales aren't lying there) after their movie/teleivision counterparts come out.

Imagine the people waiting to buy it on DVD.  The sales will be insane, as they were when HBO announced/was airing ""Game of Thrones"".",0,1318897543,null,0,true,0,c2sazei,t3_lfmgh,t1_c2sazei,t1_c2sawsw,1427745900,1,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,1

Our time isn't defined by the earths movement around the sun (the definition of a year is (mostly), but not time). Like I said 1 second is 1 second and is well defined by [""the duration of 9,192,631,770 periods of the radiation corresponding to the transition between the two hyperfine levels of the ground state of the caesium 133 atom.""](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second)). So while he may use a different scale, if he knew his age in any well defined scale he should be able to very easily convert.

It would depend, but if you are assuming that he is keeping precise measurements of time passed for him those records would likely have come back into existence when he did.

Really the episode that would make it hard to calculate would be the wedding of river song since time is stopped for everyone but him, but then again if time isn't stopped for him he may still be able to keep track of it.",0,1318903780,null,0,false,0,c2sbx0z,t3_le11t,t1_c2sbx0z,t1_c2sav0d,1427746343,1,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,1
