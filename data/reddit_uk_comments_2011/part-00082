&gt;Wow, was pleasantly surprised by their demands - most seemed pretty reasonable for students camping in a lecture theatre.

I find their list a bit too broad, to me it almost seems that they pooled a list of things they were unhappy with rather than having a premeditated plan (possible since they didn't release their demands until they'd voted on them and written them down). The anti-sexism and BAE demands are probably the strangest on the list though.

Of course, I think it's good they're taking a stand, I definitely think the University needs to take a step back without unleashing it's legal team so quickly. The protest is very civil from what I can tell.

This season they seem much more inclined to make incisive runs into the center of the pitch. This sort of movement is most beneficial when you have pacey full backs (Walker! and to some extent AEK) who can fill in the space that the wingers have left. 

I know a lot of people do not like when Bale and Lennon switch sides, but I think with time it could really be redeeming. Lennon scored last week from the left.

To be brief, some of the main issues was the beginning of the end for ""King and Country"" after the meaningless and class-centric WWI slaughter and then abandonment of people upon the Armistice taking effect. Basically here's your ten shillings now go away and be quiet until you die. This also has strong ties to the fading of the Monarchy and the forming of democracy for the first time. The Great War had a profound effect on people and how they lived and thought. To my mind this when the monarchy and its associates lost authority respect and influence. Unfortunately there was nothing of substance to replace these institutions. This remains true, to an extent.

It was also the last true hurrah of the Moneyed/Upper/Aristocracy set. They flaunted huge wealth and abandon while the general populace looked on. The gap has never been closed.

This is something I sort of grew up with.  I remember seeing the Tom Baker episodes when I was a little kid because we didn't get cable and our local access station played Doctor Who near midnight on Sundays.

I have a problem, though, when it seems (pardon the harsh language, but I'm using key words to help get a point across) that they're explaining bullshit with bullshit, and that's a lot of bullshit to swallow.  For example, I would've accepted River Song being a Timelord, but HOW she became one was a bit much to accept all at once.

It just seems like they're taking the fantastic sci-fi aspect and exploiting it for as long as they can get away with it.  As if to say ""Well, how do you explain time travel, or the fact this thing is bigger on the inside?"" is used to rationalize a lot of the WTF of the last two seasons.

Like, from ""Let's Kill Hitler"", when they introduced the temporal police force--whatever they're called, the people who are miniaturized and inhabit a lifelike human-copying battlestation...it was a bit much.  I got the feeling Moffat just made up something ridiculous so he had a way to tie up the whole Doctor-being-shot-dead-at-the-beach thing.  It would've been okay if there was a whole episode where they introduced this police force and they were the focus of the episode rather than another strange thing they encounter while dealing with brainwashed-River Song.

Another way to look at it is the stranger something is, the more care and time that should be taken to integrate it into the show.",0,1323232932,null,0,false,0,c35z99h,t3_n2kuv,t1_c35z99h,t1_c35yb9m,1427985392,1,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,1

Comparatively, the Constitution class (TOS 1701) was used in the latter half of the 23rd century, and was less than 1/5th the size. It is tiny. Even if it was considered a ship of the line (heavy cruiser, IIRC), ST technology advances exponentially quickly, just like ours does.

Gerrard is out for half a season or more, it's becoming clear now that it was a mistake to rely on him regaining fitness. Poulsen was crap, no problem seeing him go.

true,specofdust,scot-Highlands,Pasty Faced Haggis Rider,"&gt;You DO realise that the powers that be forced those changes on their constituents right? This is what I'm talking about, you're completely and conveniently forgetting the public opposition to these things. Businessmen and liberal elites made those calls,,,the regular Joe on the street moaned, bitched and had to grin and bear it.

But you're still combining two separate things into one issue, when they are not. Yes, the general public may not have wanted to respect other people's rights, but it's the job of a moral state system to enforce the respect of everyone's rights. That is, a state does not do its job if it restricts peoples rights along lines such as colour of skin or gender.

What you're talking about is a state forcing people not to say things, which is a step backward, removing rights.

&gt;Well I'm glad you're willing to sacrifice all those black people to your free speech utopia...for some reason I'm not. I;m glad you're not in charge of our anti terror laws... apparently we should only take action once the train is blown up not while they plan it!

Also unpaid work experience isn't sufficient either in my view as it means that people can only work where their parents live (assuming their parents can afford to keep them) as rent prices are generally very high, especially in the South East which is also where most of the jobs are. Public transport is also very very expensive (compare it to Germany etc.) and so commuting isn't really an option either.

&gt;  to comedians baiting strikers and disabled people

And then the subsequent ""comic"" examples. Comedy is subjective. Very often jokes, such as Jimmy Carr's, I think are made just for the shock value. An ""Oh -god-that's-awful"" schadenfreude giggle and maybe a hand raised to cover the mouth or eyes, is not the same as pissing yourself and slapping your thigh when someone says ""Look at my mong face!"" *simply* because it's lampooning a disability. I'd like to be clear: I'm not defending Gervais who, I think, has made it clear he didn't realise that word was still associated with disability. I think he thought the word had gone the same was a ""Fag"" - see the South Park episode from earlier this year: *The F word* for further details.    
My point is that I don't think it's possible or fair to lump these things into the same catagory. Even Clarkson's recent ""I'd have them shot"" I don't think can be put in the pile with Gervais.

Moving on to the homophobic problems: That's *nothing* new at all. It was around 15+ years ago when I was at school and no doubt years before that too. It might be that people think society has moved on, but I notice the example of the [Bulls turning a homosexual couple away from their B&amp;B](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-bristol-12214368) is absent: that's *older religious* people, not school kids. I was under the impression that homophobia is somewhat reduced in schools compared to what it was when I was there (late 90's/early 00's) however I've had to verbally slap my 17 year old sister and her mate for using ""gay"" as an insult or way of saying ""crap"". I'm not sure that it is *actually* calling someone gay as in implying they are homosexual and therefore bad. That might sound like double think, but I'd like to hope that the word has lost it's meaning, although of course that is a problem all on its own.

When it comes to the PC issue, I think the issue is education. ""PC gone mad!"" is the vestige of the ignorant, as the article says. I wonder if the issue is that too much time might have been spent, or *seen* to have been spent, on saying ""You can't say that!"" rather than ""Here are the reasons you shouldn't say that."" That's why introducing the concept of ""two daddies/mummies"" as early as possible is a great idea for schools. 

*Note: the Daily Heil cry of ""FOUR YEAR OLDS BEING TAUGHT ABOUT GAY SEX IN MATHS!"" is bullshit. Homosexuality would be introduced the same way racial minorities were introduced back in the day. Instead of ""Amit, James and Fatima have seven apples each..."" will be updated with things like ""Jane's daddies, Bill and Ben, are taking her to the zoo..."" That's all.*

I'm slightly confused with the tone at the start of the article compared to the end. It seems we're warned that things are going to hell and everyone is full of hate, but that actually we're not so bad and even if it were it's better than everywhere else? Slightly odd.

With regards to my slightly conflicting ideas on comedy versus PC etc. anyone feel free to try and enlighten me one way or the other. I realise there might be some confusion in my brain, as I can see that being ""OK"" with comedians apparently mocking the afflicted might not fit with thinking that people who decry PC are uneducated. Thoughts welcome.

We have two choices, therefore - compete on a wage level with industrial slave nations or accept that our system needs to be rethought and that, perhaps, a system based on everyone being employed is no longer possible, sustainable, desirable or necessary. Instead, we should transition to a non-monetary economy internally with everyone receiving an equal 'resource allowance' and all excess traded externally. 

Ultimately, as automation improves and things like RepRap and personal replication devices (of whatever complexity) become more prevalent, this will become more necessary as large industry and services become obsolete and replaced by technology that can do the same thing on an individual level. 

This will become the defining problem of the 21st century, and it's about time we tackle it.

true,alexgmcm,eng-sussex,Sussex,"Well they seem to think that we require some superhuman AI to run the economy when in fact if we just moved towards their ideal via a guaranteed minimum income or negative income tax scheme combined with controls on working hours to ensure that the burden of work (which is now insufficient to provide full employment) is fairly distributed whilst everyone still receives enough to live with dignity then we would eventually reach the utopia they quite rightly desire.

The main ideas that need to be established are:

* The obligation of work for all - that is whether you are a 'benefit scrounger', member of royalty, or shareholder, everyone should work towards their standard of living and not merely attain it via birth or property.

* Automation and technological progress are desirable and should act to reduce the burden of work for all. The distribution of wealth and work should be fair so that we do not face crisis of unemployment nor do we cease to invest in technology as wage slavery is cheaper.

* As mentioned previously, wealth and work should be fairly distributed and inequality kept to the minimum justifiable level, where possible working hours should be reduced and spread out.

These ideas are not new and Bertrand Russell amongst many others such as the technocrats like Hubbert etc. have also written about them.  It is possible to sustain our rate of progress without the misery of unemployment merely by redistributing the work and wealth. This is possible because we are facing a crisis of overproduction, which compared to the alternative is far better, as it is an illusory crisis brought about by an obsolete system of distribution, not actual scarcity of resources.

The immediate changes should be to introduce a guaranteed minimum income or negative income tax alongside incentives to divide up working hours (all of which are proposed by the Green Party). There should be similar incentives to invest in R&amp;D.

Well, by that logic, eating is a personal selfish goal. On the contrary though, procreation is far from selfish. For one thing, and I hate to be the one to break it to you, the act requires a certain amount of collaboration. Additionally, kids do turn into adults, and adults do provide most of the GDP in this country. In fact, I think it's fair to say that without procreation, the economy would suffer quite a lot.

&gt; The world doesn't owe anyone a living - why does this go out the window just because they want to reproduce?

That sounds like regurgitated rhetoric. It doesn't even apply here, does it? Are we talking about providing parents with a job? 

Child support is intended to provide every child with a minimum standard of upbringing. It's no different than ensuring a worker has a minimum standard of living.

I am a British Born Indian male. Let me give you **my** point of view on this whole issue of intolerance.

I have to say I don't really think Britain as a whole has gotten more intolerant. I disagree with Hugh Muirs here. As a Brit-Indian though there are a few things I hate about this country when it comes to tolerance.

* **Everywhere I go and interact with new people, everyone assumes I'm a Pakistani and Muslim. I am seriously offended by this. If you are unsure of my ethnicity, please ask. If someone who is brown and is offended by you asking them about their ethnicity, then that person is a moron. You should inform them they are being moronic. Once again, not offended if you ask me my ethnicity**

* ****
 
* **Now, because of the tabloids, people think brown people are offended by Christmas. Seriously, what. the. fuck. Why the fucking fuck would I be offended by Christmas. Why? I used to work at Debenhams and at Christmas time my line manager came up to me and this other muslim girl and told me and her that they were setting up Christmas displays and we should tell her if we had any objections. The muslim girl was shy and she didn't really want to make a fuss so she said no. But, I went King Leonidas on my line-manager's arse and told her why she thought I would want to object to Christmas decoration. Natuarally, she wanted to be sensative to our needs. I replied ""I HAVE THE NEED TO SEE CHRISTMASSY SHIT WOMAN! I LOVE FUCKING CHRISTMAS. I GET PRESENTS FOR FUCKS SAKE! I GET TO HAVE A PHAT ARSE MEAL WITH AS MUCH ALCOHOL AS I WANT AND I GET A DAY OFF WORK WHY WOULD I BE OFFENDED BY THIS AWESOMENESS? I proceeded to scream ""THIS IS KIDSWEAR"", then kicked her in the stomach. (may be slightly exaggerated). Seriously though, my family have celebrated Christmas ever since I was a baby. My dad used to dress up as santa claus and my auntie make a traditional Christmas meal. Most of my extended family also do this. Some don't, but they still have a nice meal and get together.**

****

Ok now that I got that out of my system I want to talk about what's wrong with my community.

Now, if you live in London you may be aware of an area called **[Southall](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southall)**. You'd be hard pressed to find a white person here. It's pretty much non-white people who live here. But, up and down the country you will find areas where mostly Asians live, Black people live, White people live and so on and so forth. I grew up with many Pakistani friends and have discussed this with them. My interpretation of this is Pakistani people just like sticking to where their ""own"" are. As a result lots of them all live near each other, thus creating ghettos. This obviously alienates the white people who see this as an attack on their their community. I whole heartedly disagree with this notion as it causes rifts in the community and is bad for cohesion. My brother for example, lives in Hayes, London at the moment. He's just had a little baby girl and he doesn't want her to grow up in Hayes because their are too many Indians and Pakistanis. His reasoning is he doesn't want her growing up in these ghettos where she will only interact with British Asian youths. So he's moving the family to St. Albans next year. 

Onto my next point, in my community, the Indian youths that have grown up in ghettos are incredibly isolationist. Through the words of my own cousin ""I ain't hanging round with no **gorah**, we should stick to our own.""

gorah = white person (this is not a derogatory slur per se, but can be be used as one. Like Black person isn't derogatory, but in conjunction with a swear word, it becomes a racial slur.)

This mentality amongst my brothers and sisters in the Indian community is what is preventing us from really reaching ethnic cohesion.

So yeah, I guess that's my rant. If you object please reply and we can discuss this like adults. This is my **interpretation**, if you're pakistani muslim or white or purple, please give me your thoughts.

Merlin is silly and ridiculous and so much fun! I think it has the same feel to it as a silly RTD episode of Doctor Who and I love it. The first couple seasons are great and fun, but some of the episodes can be pretty terrible. This season though, is on FIRE. Every single episode has blown me away.

Black Books is amazingly funny, but it's very British and you may not get the humor. I thought it was hilarious, but I showed it to a couple of my friends and they didn't get it.

Jonathan Creek is quite a bit of fun. It sort of has a Sherlock Holmes feel to it. I really, really don't like how the show treats their female characters though. They're all irrational harpies who fall into the ridiculous Hollywood romcom stereotype - the one where a woman can take a golfclub to her ex's car and everyone treats that as normal behavior and not someone who needs anger management. 

Pride and Prejudice will always have a place in my heart (along with [Mr. Darcy](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_bwW1yf1iijw/TMo68tISFXI/AAAAAAAAFV4/19x6Q3-ljNk/s1600/Mr.+Darcy.jpg))

If there is one Premier League team AVB **must** keep a wary eye on, it has to be Man City. Having sold Tevez off(?) to AC Milan, Mancini has sent a strong message to the rest of the team, ""Leave your shoes and egos at the door, please."" 

The other potential Tevez a.k.a. Balotelli seems to be focusing on his game &amp; playing better - he still continues to behave like a pompous prick every now &amp; then. Honestly, I wouldn't be surprised if he starts throwing starry tantrums and gets shipped off next; I just hope AVB doesn't buy him. We don't need any more egos in the Blue dressing room, as it is.

Long story short, I see that Mancini is looking to build a 'team' and has made it clear that no kind of nonsense fuckwittery will be tolerated.

As for ManU, I can only imagine the tantrum the old gaffer must have thrown at the kids in the dressing room. I imagine a lot of them will find themselves mowing the Old Trafford lawn in rotation as punishment for all the CL days (and revenue) that ManU have missed out on.

I keep telling myself I'm biased but the more I watch all of these guys play the more I think we have the most complete left back in the league right now. He has a passing range that many clubs don't have from their midfield, he has the pace to recover or overlap when we invert wingers, and he's extremely crafty in 1v1 situations and when in possession. He's probably made fewer costly mistakes the last two seasons than players who are rated much higher typically. 

At this point his biggest issue is overconfidence in possession. You have to think sooner or later dudes are going to stop getting posterized by his little fake clearance.

It's not just the title isn't worth as much as the 3 cups we're still in contention for, it's the travelling: Mancini's ""we're playing a game every 3 days"" line that he uses in almost *every interview* is a way of being able to justify leaving some - if not all - of the top players at home.

Also, it works well with the fans. He knows we don't care much about the Europa, so if he sends the reserves and we finish the season without any silverware he'll be able to say ""well, I prioritised, but it didn't work out, did what I could, sorry about that"". 

If he sends the squad that played last night out on a tour of games with Swedish postmen and the like and we come away with no silverware in the domestic competition, he'll be blamed for not resting them enough.

Pension funds and insurance funds typically only invest in highly rated securities (as part of their investment criteria) so when they see a triple A rated investment yielding far far more than any triple A rated investment should ever yield, they will jump at it (fund investment managers pay depend on their performance in generating returns on investment). 

If the bank wasnt holding on to the ultimate risk of default, then they really didnt have any incentive to do any due diligence. and the people who ultimately held the risk assumed someone else had done the due diligence when the securities they bought were given really high ratings.

This comment about the proportionality of white convictions suggest that you think that crime stats should reflect population percentage. If that is so, then what are your thoughts on the disproportionate numbers of young black men in prison? 

There are those who say it's down to institutional bias, but you yourself comment that:

Okay, this was not some attempt to lie or misrepresent, this was admittedly poor reading comprehension on my part.

Nonetheless, that does not negate my point. Roughly equal numbers of black and white people report being victims of racial assault, however, the proportion of convictions are overwhelmingly white.

The Doctor is not an idiot.

To which River replies that it is definitely him (either because he showed up on the scan because he was inside the robot, or because she knew his plan, having already lived it out, and had to pretend he was dead, or a couple of other explanations depending on how time works). Frankly I think that shooting down this theory so directly and apparently offhandedly when it turns out to be 99% true is maliciously deceptive for the audience. I always imagine there's a level of trust for the writers on behalf of the audience not to use such techniques.

Now, the Doctor knows more about Time Travel than anyone. The idea that it wouldn't occur to him that a fixed event that everyone *calls* his ""death"" could be avoided by making himself *appear* to die is absurd and unbelievable.

And in this case they didn't but you *really* want them to. Either you're against it or you're not.

&gt;I find it a little disconcerting that you can effectively call me a racist

I didn't call you a racist, I simply asked you to examine the thought process that has you more concerned about this story or feel you have more invested in it because you share the same racial make up as the victim.

&gt;I mean, do you not think that - although well meaning - the entire concept of hate crime has only served to drive wedges between British people?

Only where people simply wanted to stick their heads in the sand and feel something is being ""forced"" on them. Look at it this way, you're now arguing with me that some case that has nothing to do with you is indicative of a wider situation that could lead to you being disenfranchised in some way...you want me to acknowledge that and I assume you want something to be done about it.

Well, welcome to the life of a black or Asian person in Britain for the last 50 years! The systemic and societal beat down that ethnic minorities have received in this country are the reason behind the legislations you're now complaining about. So in essence you'd like me to acknowledge when white people are victims of an unfair system, but you'd rather like the safety nets put in place to stop ethnic minorities being the victims of an unfair system to go away as you don't really see any issue there. Do you see how that could be a bit unfair on your part?

Here's the difference. If say I rear ended your car and we got into a fight over it, at least some logical explanation could be made and you could rest easy that as long as these two people don't run their vehicles into each other they're unlikely to fight again. But now you take a guy who only fought the other guy because he was another race...there's no way to guarantee he's not going to do it again. He fundamentally has a problem with people simply based on race and they don't have to have done anything to motivate him to attack them. A person like that can't be legislated for. If someone merely standing there with a different skin colour is his provocation, then he's simply more dangerous than someone who's provocation would be some unlikely human interaction like having a drink spilled on them or a too long look at their missus.",0,1323341831,null,0,false,0,c367ubc,t3_n3rrz,t1_c367ubc,t1_c367ruh,1427989510,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

You need to eat to stay alive. You don't need to have children to stay alive. Yes, you need to have a certain number of children born in order to continue the species, but there's no need to subsidise the process to the point where people who otherwise wouldn't are choosing to have kids.

&gt;I hate to be the one to break it to you, the act requires a certain amount of collaboration.

Wow, you blow me away. So there are two people involved; it's still their choice and their desire to reproduce that they are fulfilling. A couple is capable of being selfish.

&gt;That sounds like regurgitated rhetoric.

It's not, but it does sound a bit crap....

&gt;It doesn't even apply here, does it? Are we talking about providing parents with a job?

Yes it does apply, and if only we were talking about providing parents with jobs. We are talking about people whose lives are suddenly subsidised and in some cases entirely provided for by the state, purely because they chose to reproduce. The financial responsibilities of parenthood are not something that should or even deserve to be removed.

&gt;Child support is intended to provide every child with a minimum standard of upbringing. 

Yes that's a laudable goal, to help children that are already here. But in reality it's used to lower the financial entry barrier to parenthood - in a lot of cases to below ground level.

On the contrary, births rate in the western world do need propping up. 

Also, what do you mean by 'people who otherwise wouldn't'? Do you think that without child support, people living in relative poverty would happily choose not to reproduce? I think you'll find they'll have children regardless, and the children will just have a miserable start in life and likely be a drain on the economy later in life. The biological imperative is strong enough that it happens even in the midst of a famine in Africa (for example), what makes you think it'll be different here?

I think you would like to believe that people would act as rational players in this situation, just like the economics textbooks say they would. But the truth is that people are driven by greater needs than their finances allow for. That is a fault with the economy, not with people.

I had the privileged of doing a college work experience placement many years ago with an ex Polaris submariner, coolest, totally nerves of steel guy I've ever met. 

It was in a Rushton's gas turbine house ( basically a gas powered Rolls Royce Jet engine ) that used its high powered jet stream to dry wood-chips for kitchen worktops in a huge cyclone type affair. This day the conveyer belt carrying the wood chips snapped and the wet wood chips started to block up the jet outlet further down the chain causing blow-back into the turbine i.e. an extremely dangerous situation sending the turbine temperature and RPM's way over the top. 

Normally at this point you'd hit the emergency stop and the whole cyclone thing would just dump its contents, but because the blockage was behind the mechanism that dumped the chips it didn't work which was making the turbines RPM's go through the fucking roof. Personally I thought it was going to blow which would have taken half the factory with it. I was scared shitless to be honest. 

This guy walks straight into the middle of the situation ( now pissing hot oil everywhere and literally vibrating the whole turbine house to the point where you couldn't see of hear anything )  grabs the correct turbine feeding gas valve and shuts it down without even thinking about it.

He stood there, rolled his eyes skyward and said: Ok... Well that could've gone wrong, lunch anyone?

Unpaid internships appear because the job market is so lacking that demand for jobs is pushed to a point where people will willingly do the work for free. A possible (read: likely) result of forcing employers to pay these interns is that they'll just remove the internship entirely instead, and everyone loses. In the endgame, instead of having young people working for nothing but gaining essential experience, you'll have more young people with no experience, but the job market is the same and unemployment increases.

Legislating against stuff like this is just cutting off one head of the Hydra. The problem that needs to be tackled is simply the lack of job availability. More jobs = less demand per job --&gt; wages increase.

For me it's about what motivates a crime. If two people have a disagreement and they fight, at least the root cause can be pinpointed. If a person kills for money or for revenge, there's a clear motive that can be isolated. You can clearly see if there is a resolution. If I assault a man for insulting my girlfriend, well after my punishment is done I'm not likely to randomly attack someone else for it again.

But, if my attack was driven by an irrational dislike of some trait that my victim shares with millions of others...if there's no clear end to it, then what should be done with me? After my punishment is done for an attack on a man for being gay, I'm more than likely to run into yet another man who's gay, and another and another. There's no logical end because the motivation wasn't a single thing done to me by a single person or a clearly defined motivation like a relatives inheritance etc.

Compare it to a person with mental health issues who kills or attacks. they are usually held indefinitely until their mental state can be determined...their crime seems to fly in the face of all rationality, and for me hate crimes are the same.

true,widgetas,null,null,"[Emma West was charged with racially aggravated public order offence.](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-16051120)

Although people might disagree, she wasn't convicted *for being* racist but for the way she expressed it, I think.

I think it's the difference between: ""I don't like black people"" and ""Fuck you, black bastard"".

With regards to the actual case in hand: I have mixed feelings. On the one hand I can understand that some people will be more likely to be attacked because of their race, religion, sexuality etc. And, as our society tends to frown on discrimination (as a whole), it would make sense to punish those who commit such crimes.

However, I'm somewhat conflicted as it would seem that if a loved one of mine is murdered 'just because', their murderer will get less time inside than someone who killed someone because of one of the particular traits outlined above.

I find that troubling and not entirely fair.

I didn't walk straight into a job, and this was three years before the recession, right during the boom. University degrees are not the same thing as vocational training, and the fact that most middle-class kids now go to university means that having a degree does little to set you apart from the crowd.

Frankly, I'd argue that anyone graduating from university in engineering right now is utterly fucked unless they have work-place experience under their belt. Paying to get that experience doesn't sound like such a bad idea, if it helps you start a career.

Look at it from the companies point of view; they're laying off people, they don't want to take a chance on inexperienced kids for the openings they do have. They can take work placement students, but it costs them money to look after them and actually teach them something useful.

true,D-Hex,yorkshire,Yorkshire,"&gt;Yes, but still out-sized by Germany and any combination of Germany plus one of Spain, Italy, France is sufficient to gain a majority in the EU with the backing of a few smalelr states.  

&lt;-- only AFTER the treaty changes after Maastricht came along. At the point when Maastricht was being negotiated we could have been in the centre of things we chose not to be. 

&gt; We'd also have suffered a lot more for being in the Euro.

and 

&gt;We had that already, plus we objected to Germany and France breaking the Stability and Growth pact (even though Brown would have broken it as well). The point is us being in would have done little to make it better because there was no plitical will to make hard choices.

When the Euro was considered in the early 1990s and was being formed the Eurozone club was formed to align currencies and economies to the convergence criteria. We weren't in that becase we didn't want to join the Euro. If we'd been in that than we coul dhave demanded proper enforcement of the convergence criteria while protecting our key industries. 

Again .. we  *chose* not to. It wasn't becuase the Euro was doomed, or it was a bad idea at the time , or any of the other reasons we can apply now becuase of the decade that intervened. When it was being thought of we should have been there making sure we controlled at least some of it. 

Instead we stood outside looking in, and we're still doing the same. You have more influence when you're part of the process than carping about it from the outside. 

All our valid concerns about a democratic deficit, competitiveness of markets and everything else meant nothing - simply becuase everyone thought we hated Europe and weren't interested. ",0,1323359638,null,0,false,0,c369fvr,t3_n4nuw,t1_c369fvr,t1_c367yyw,1427990264,5,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,5

The expected Euro value was that it would buy a dollar for €0.82. It immediately dropped below 1:1 on its creation and spent the better part of a decade getting back to where it was.

The Euro returned to the strength of what European currencies held previously only very recently. It has surpassed it since because the US started printing money like it was going out of fashion.

Also prices across the union shot up after its creation. Several previous favourite holiday spots have lost out because of the price confusing when the new currency came in.

Regardless it went from $1.22 to $0.89 in the half a decade after it was created. Then stabilised.

What was a terrible idea was the half arsed approach to the formation of the EU institutions - as well as the huge democratic deficit. That should have been solved, and we should have been pushing to solve it. 

However, when you ask a national politician to give up or modify his power in return for proper democracy at the EU level - you're always going to get a ""no"". 

Strategically we've known, and every serous economist has known that China, the US were going to be our competitors in the future. The formation of the EU and the Europe achieved two things, gave you a large trading bloc and internal market, and stabilised Europe so there would be no more war. 

It achieved most of those. Look at the effect EU membership or the prospect of it has had on democracy and co-operation in the former Eastern bloc, and Turkey. In terms of trade the EU internal market fits nicely in between the US and China/India in terms of size and median wealth was near the top. 

So it wasn't such a bad idea. The constant drip feed of euroscepticism in our country makes us think it was. 

Oh and think of this, if people are worried about a democratic deficit, why don't the same right wing politicians in the UK that cry about the Euro, seem to miss the real threat to our democracy  - the markets?

Couldn't agree more.

&gt; However, when you ask a national politician to give up or modify his power in return for proper democracy at the EU level - you're always going to get a ""no"". 

Really? They have been happily doing that for a while.

&gt; Strategically we've known, and every serous economist has known that China, the US were going to be our competitors in the future. 

You forgot India, and relatively speaking I'd expect to see a decline in America.

&gt; In terms of trade the EU internal market fits nicely in between the US and China/India in terms of size and median wealth was near the top. 

It has its benefits, but as the PIGS are showing there is a lot of liberalisation still to be done with little political willpower to do it.

&gt; So it wasn't such a bad idea. The constant drip feed of euroscepticism in our country makes us think it was. 

In principle I agree, however the current implmentation of the EU is a joke, I'd struggle to design a worse system. It's one big politically horse-traded mess with little sign of improving.

&gt; Oh and think of this, if people are worried about a democratic deficit, why don't the same right wing politicians in the UK that cry about the Euro, seem to miss the real threat to our democracy - the markets? 

Because they are probably not complete and utter tits.  ""A market is one of many varieties of systems, institutions, procedures, social relations and infrastructures whereby parties engage in exchange."" 

They are no more a threat to democracy than a butterfly. What I presume you mean is the issue of corpratism.

With the American paper you were assessed on the entire time period but for the Russian and Germany exams the questions were only on a section of a course. So for example one year the Russian paper would be about 1905-14 one year and 1914-17 the next. 

Some of the teachers who had been working for longer had realised that the exam board chose which section of the course to test based on a particular cycle. That way they could predict what the questions were going to be on in the next year, and as history doesn't change, they knew what the questions would be in the coming exam.

First off I want to make it clear that I am not a police officer, I dont want anyone to think that I'm presenting myself as such. I work for a police force as a member of support staff.

I'm pretty disturbed by this incident as well, its a tragedy when anyone dies and when they die in custody (or shortly afterwards) its not just a grieving family, but also a great deal of damage to the already fragile relationship between police and community. Not to mention the effect it has on the officers involved (both mentally and in terms of the subsequent investigation and press attention).

As far as officers covering their badge numbers goes - its wrong. If you are in uniform you need to be identifiable. Im sure that some worry about being fucked over by their superiors and hung out to dry if they happen to (for example) hit someone in the knee and give them a shove and this is why you sometimes see the practise.

As far as the 333 deaths goes, like I said elsewhere when you are dealing day in day out with violent offenders and pepper spray is being deployed, and firearms units are being deployed and people are charging at police with knives then I'm frankly surprised that its is that low. I think it speaks for the professionalism of the british police that so many situations are diffused and handled. Dont get me wrong, I'd like that figure to be lower, everyone would. There are certain tools that my uniformed colleges would like, such as taser which could probably help towards bringing that figure down - in this case if taser was used it could have ended very differently.

As far as conviction rate goes I dont think I can comment, each case needs to be judged on its own merit. But I can reassure anyone who still believes a word that I say that the IPCC do not give us an easy ride.

You hand then in to your Supervisors who correct them (usually... In first year they will make the effort) and then go over the questions during Supervision, giving you the anwsers and showing you alternate/easier ways of answering the problem.  

Unlike many courses there's no additional reading, your Lecture notes form a complete basis for your work, and the sheets can be answered entirely using notions from your Lectures. You can buy books for some courses and your Lecturers will indicate which are particularly relevant for the course he/she is teaching,  but this is strictly ancillary.  

One Example sheet takes about 10h to finish on average. You will have two supervisions a week, 4h of lectures every day in First Year, throwing in a few hours to learn the material brings an overall total of 40h weekly of work estimated.  

This is usually enough to keep you working for several hours most days whilst allowing you some time off for clubs/activities and going out into town without feeling exhausted or forcing you into all-nighters.

Right, so:

Want Nike trainers to look flash = 10 motive points

Don't want to go to Jail for 2 years (ignoble motive) for stealing them = 5 deterrent points

Therefore, steal trainers.

Want Nike trainers so my talented but underprivileged child can run athletics = 10 motive points

Don't want to go to Jail for 1 year (noble motive) for stealing them = 3 deterrent points

Therefore, steal trainers.


What I'm trying to convey (poorly), is that perhaps reducing sentences based on what may be seen as noble motives for crime (Soldiering and accidents aside (including soldering accidents)) actually incentivises the crime as a solution to a particular problem.


Of course there's no telling what the prices in points for my above examples, or the interbank exchange rate between motive points and deterrent points, should be.


Also - Motive varies in strength:

I want to kill him because he slept with my wife, she is the light of my life = 10 motive points

I want to kill him because he slept with my wife, she is she's an ugly cow (Norah Batty) = 5 motive points


So should the punishment for the latter murder be less, because although the motivations were the same, the magnitude was lower?

It appears as if they will be settling, which admits liability, but fining these massive companies is pointless. this is again why I think directors need to be personally liable. 

Absolutely, the banks were enabled by government. They shouldn't even have the ability to produce credit as far as i'm concerned, it is effectively legalised counterfeiting. I'm not a big fan of democracy even before we get companies involved as it is just the majority oppressing a minority. with a constitution, that is actually protected then maybe, but otherwise it is just an illusion of democracy.

And to be fair, until The Empty Child, 9 is pretty hard to access for new viewers. The music is bad, the pacing is kinda slow... and the camp is not that appealing (unless you're an old Baker fan or started out on 9).

I find letting them catch up, and then when they're done with S06, they go back and watch 9+10... and then they start in on select classic episodes.

true,nssmuckers,num5-away,,"These two I would probably agree on, though at this point it may be based on reputation and experience more than anything.

For our team, BAE is absolutely perfect because his passing range allows him to quickly distribute the ball to our wingers, which is massive for our attack. 

Incredibly, 19% of BAE's passes are long balls. Compare that to Cole at 8%, Evra at 5%, Baines at 12%, Enrique at 11%. 

He's attempted 145 long passes and completed 96 of them, for 66%. Cole has completed the second most among those players at just 45. None of the others have even attempted 100, and only Cole's impressive 77% long ball accuracy exceeds BAE's, in spite of none of them even remotely approaching the number of attempts he has. 

He has roughly 80% total pass completion, a figure that is only bettered by Cole and Evra among those players. Considering that almost a fifth of his passes are long balls, it's extremely impressive that he's STILL a more accurate passer than guys like Enrique and Baines.

And finally, he has attempted 55 more passes than Cole, who is the closest to him. 70 more than Enrique, 194 more than Baines, 209 more than Evra. 

Simply put, he's passing about as much as Frank Lampard and Lucas do every game. He's very much an additional playmaker. He's not just slamming the ball long; he's extremely accurate and starts many of our attacks. 

Defensive potency is a bit harder to show in statistics, and ultimately I'd probably agree that Evra and Cole are more solid there, but I don't think there's that much between them anymore, honestly. A few years ago he was making so many mistakes, now he just has the occasional moment of poor positioning. 

You could argue that Cole and others are capable of playmaking like BAE if they were in our system (and I think for Cole you'd probably be right), but I think players give him the ball because they know what he can do with it. 

TL;DR: I was bored and looked at some stats. BAE is perfect for our squad.

URGENT – HURRICANE BAWBAG APPEAL

On the 8th of December 2011, a hurricane of biblical strength blasted across North and Central Scotland. Victims can be seen wandering aimlessly muttering: ""Ah wiz pure shittin' masel big man so a wiz, ah need some jellies"". The hurricane decimated the area, causing approximately £30 worth of damage. Untold disruption and distress was caused:

* Many were woken well before their giro arrived.
* Several priceless collections of mementos from the Balearics and Spanish costas were damaged.
* Three areas of historic and scientifically significant litter were disturbed.
* The cone fell off the head of the statue outside Glasgow’s Modern Art Gallery.
* Thousands are confused and bewildered, trying to come to terms with the fact that something interesting has happened in Scotland.
* One resident, Pocahontis McGlinchy, a 17 year old mother-of-three said ""Ah wiz like ‘Whit’s that? Ah, canny hear ma choonz innat man’ Wee Beyonce came running into my bedroom pure howlin so she wiz. My youngest two, Brooklyn an Blackpool slept through it. I was still pure rattlin when I was watching Jeremy Kyle the next morning.""
* Apparently though, looting did carry on as normal.
* The British Red Cross have so far managed to ship 4000 crates of Buckfast to the area to help the stricken masses.
* Rescue workers are still searching through the rubble and have found large quantities of personal belongings including benefit books and jewellery from Elizabeth Duke at Argos.

HOW YOU CAN HELP
Clothing is most sought after. Items required include:

* Sovvy rings
* Baseball caps
* Shell suits
* Tesco two stripe trainers
* White socks
* Chunky gold chains
* Any Burberry clothing

Food parcels may be harder to put together but are necessary all the same. Required foodstuffs include:

* Mutty Pies and Buckfast
* Hauf Pizza Suppers and Buckfast
* Mars Bars and Buckfast
* Kebabs and Buckfast
* Haggis Suppers and Buckfast
* Fray Bentos Pies and Buckfast

* £2 buys chips, scraps and ginger for a family of four.
* £10 can take a family to Coatbridge for the day, where children can sniff glue and spike up among the national collection of stinging nettles.
* 22p buys a biro for filling in a spurious compensation claim

While I understand his thinking I disagree with a loan spell, I don't think we need KK to get him scoring again when he plays for a top 4 competitor, even one that we routinely win against. On top of that I doubt he'd want to come back after all the stick he got for leaving (as deserving as he was). Besides I'd rather see us make a permanent move for a finisher in January.

I only started following football and supporting LFC at the end of the 2009-2010 season so I never really got to watch him play when he was healthy, but from the highlights I've seen he was unstoppable. He isn't even a shadow of the player he used to be. Its almost as if he doesn't try, its how he looked in the games I saw him play at LFC (with the exception of his performance against CFC last year) and its how hes looked this year for Chelsea.

Only way I'd take him back is if it was permanent, for ~15mil (or a straight swap for Carroll), and he came out and said he was wrong/apologized for leaving to begin with. He claimed he was chasing higher honors and better competition but he doesn't even play at CFC, good luck ever finding form again in those circumstances.",0,1323382315,null,0,false,0,c36dlvf,t3_n5cqk,t1_c36dlvf,t3_n5cqk,1427992300,2,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,2

When we used to play this formation under Rafa it worked well because Mascherano could shield the defence and Xabi could act as playmaker. While Charlie Adam could play Xabi's role, albeit not as well, he is a much more attacking player than what is required in this formation.

If Lucas was fit then 4-2-3-1 would be possible with him playing the Masch role and potentially using Adam, Spearing or Gerrard as a deep-lying playmaker, but without Lucas it really isn't possible for Liverpool; Spearing just isn't dominant enough to rely on to shield the defence time and time again. Let's see what happens in January. If we bring a centre midfielder in then maybe.

true,LokianEule,mccoy,Time's Champion,"Okay, *deep breath*, Doctor Who ran from 1963-1989 then rebooted in 2005. By no means do I suggest you start at 1963. You should choose between 2005 reluanch and 2010 when the new writer, Doctor, and companions took over. It felt very much like a re-relaunch.

Pros of 2005: you get to see more Doctors, more adventures, companions, etc. You won't miss out on it by skipping it. No prior info needed to watch here

Cons: It's a bit cheesy and the writing needs a lot of forgiveness the first two series. The show still shines though.

For 2010 Pros: Great writing, shiny new everything, same awesomeness that DW always has, fresh start, no prior info needed

Cons: You miss out on 2005-2009. You won't get to experience the show chronologically and see how things change and develop. You'll get spoiled by the special effects.

Even with these pros and cons, if you choose 2010 you should go back afterwards to 2005 and up. While the writing and effects may not be as shiny, there are still wonderful heartbreaking stories here, and both Doctors absolutely shine. Many people went on Who-hiatus because they thought the new guy wouldn't live up to the 10th Doctor.

*""It's an extraordinary statement of priorities at the moment in itself the fact that the city is at the top of the agenda when there is so much concern about the impact of bankers. The very cause of the problems addressed by Europe is to some degree being defended by David Cameron as his number one priority. We might agree that the City has a role, to make it your priority is extremely odd.*

*But purely economically he is also wrong. The problems in Europe there is a balance of payments crisis. As Martin Wolf argued in the FT yesterday [£] the value of payments is wrong and we need to put that right. One of the major reasons that's happened is because of the free movement of capital which is the basis of the City of London. We need to slow it down. A financial transaction tax would help do that. It's one of the essential measures to bring capital back under control.

You will have to touch it up through out the day. You'll be running your hands through your hair quite a lot. Don't use Axe wax or anything like that. Get real hair wax. Bumble&amp; bumble or some stuff like that. You might have to step into a salon to get it, sorry. Suck it up be a man.

How they do it, is they part on one side of his head. comb it all over to one side(you can usually see at least one of the parts that they do). (this is after you have gotten your waxes in while your hair is damp NOT WET, usually about a dollap the size of your thumb nail and thickness of your thumb, rub it all over your hands to get it warm and pliable, attack the roots to get the wax all the way down to the bottom) once its over, they take the comb and go  the exact opposite direction but not adding in the part. 

This basically picks up the hair and brings it back to the center, If the hair is dry enough, but pliable enough it should get into the right shape. Use your hands to finish it up(this gets it more in the correct shape than just trying to spike it with your hands, also it helps when you actually have tennant length bangs which go down to his eyes almost, doing it with your hands will work if its shorter hair than that though). 

My hair lady at the salon I went to showed me how to do it for a costume party one year. It's a simple way to do it. Hell, I suggest going to a salon, they can cut your hair the correct way, and show you how to do it in person.

true,questionman1,null,null,"As a neutral I'd like to chime in quickly.  I like Arsenal, I feel a certain fondness towards Wenger, I like RVP and a few of their other players.  But since the start of this season, Arsenal fans have been doing a great job of turning me  off the club.  It is petty behaviour set almost at maximum.

I can understand banter and to a certain extent, a little bit of schadenfreude...check out [r/chelsea](http://www.reddit.com/r/chelseafc), or [liverpool](http://www.reddit.com/r/LiverpoolFC) to see how much more classy these fans seem (in this occasion at least).

As I said, I can understand banter, but this is unhealthy obsession.  Borderline insanity.  Furthermore, I particularly don't approve of the Nasri chants that Arsenal fans seem to be so proud of.  I think it is incredibly disgusting and petty.

Sort of similarly ibpants, I don't really approve of your other post taking a snipe at Man U.  But then again, I'm not a City fan so perhaps I don't fully understand the scope of your rivalry...however more importantly, it is only one post.  I do think Man U going out is good for City because it puts City's ""failure"" into context...Man U in a way validates City's entrance into the Europa league as well.  It gives the competition greater value.

But yeah, as I said, Arsenal fans ahve been doing a great job in removing any affection I had for their club.  I hope City fans are much more classy during the aftermath of their upcoming encounters.

Edit:

Oh yeah, one point that I think is worht pointing out...as a neutral I spend a little mroe time in r/gunners than perhaps the rest fo you but here's an attempt at trying to place their feelings in context.

1.)  The only reason, that Nasri gets so much flack is because they desperately miss him.  It's like a scorned mistress.  A modern day version of the fox and sour grapes

2.)  Arsenal fans are genuinely frightened that City is going to take Arsenal's invincible title.  Now in all honesty, I don't think that's likely, but much more relevant, I don't even think that's important.  I find it hard to be impressed by the invincibles when Mourinho came in and achieved a higher point total.  I think that is an accomplishment to be proud of.  And I'm amazed by the point totals RM and Barca have been generating over teh past two seasons.  Personally, those accomplishments carry far greater weight for me.  YOu can have an invincibles season and only finish with 38 points...and then get relegated.

It felt wrong and I just love this team. Having said that, I don't blame him for leaving. He was in a very bad rut and things with Liverpool were looking grim. Chelsea were in a better situation than us and he thought a change of scenery would be a good thing. He obviously wasn't happy and I really don't blame him for changing his situation to become happy. I don't think he deserved all the hatred from the fans that he got. It's obvious the fans adored him but that doesn't mean the man is obligated to stay with a team he felt was going in the wrong direction (misjudgment). I think that he loved his fans but under the circumstances he thought he needed to change. So he did. And here we are still talking about him. In hindsight he probably regrets leaving. As said, a Suarez/Torres partnership is mouth watering.

As far as I am aware it is the engineering-related industries which I have generally thought youngsters tended to stay away from essentially because they didn't want to be called nerds by their peers.

I've felt that there is an entire culture that denigrates hard work or hard subjects, such that people who consider themselves cool or want to be considered cool would stay away from these engineering related subjects.

I've even seen dairy lea adverts for munchables that had an advert that basically contrasted a ginger nerdy kid with glasses and a cool black kid who had dairy lea munchables and loads of friends. the two strong messages from the advert are ""you are cool and popular if you have dairy lea munchables"", and ""you don't want to be the nerdy kid"". Worse, there is also the message, ""ginger kids or kids with glasses are worse than you"" so the advert blatantly contributes to hostility or bullying amongst kids who don't know any better.

I find adverts like that fucking disgusting and I hate how children who can't be expected to have any psychological defences against this, are manipulated in this way by international corporations (so Dairy Lea are on my personal boycott list).

I see your latest effort is predicated on the assumption that an under-regulated financial service is our only competitive advantage, implying that if there were higher regulation/taxation, we would lose the industry and lose out.

You've just answered my point, the right to protest is not about standing in a designated area, protest inherently means that you should be  causing some form of chaos to a system, otherwise the population at large dont even know your cause exists. Standing in a designated area, shielded from view, not allowed to voice opinions or cause offence means the population at large can be effectively managed into ignoring you. 

The whole right to protest itself has been marginalised in this country, the state-controlled media ignore you until you step out of line. This is when people start talking about the issues, only when you break the law. 

Look at the riots during the summer, these things have been boiling away in the background amongst the lower classes in the country for some time, their protestastions have been ignored and ignored until a break occurs. When faced with a set of rules that impoverishes you and demonises you, and then with a system that ignores you, and then with a system that turns a blind eye to the peaceful protest system that they set up, what are you meant to do then???

All he originally said was that it is not mutually exclusive to do what is best for those working in the city, and Britain as a whole, by rejecting this element of regulation and taxation.  The last thing Britain needs to do is to contribute a lion share to a €200 billion bailout through the IMF and it certainly wasn't a lack of British regulation that caused the crisis in Spain, Ireland, Greece, or Italy, and Britain's already taken the Irish bailout on the chin and gone full in.

Out of 4 global financial center indexes 3 name London as the world's number one in the world.  Europe wanted blanket and uniform financial reform, with taxes, which financially would have hit Britain far harder than any other EU country.  David Cameron simply asked for an additional protocol to protect UK financial services, and the UK itself, from being disproportionately hit.  

France and Germany refused a UK protocol;  
So the UK said 'No'.  

Frankeh was quite right to say that the two were not mutually exclusive.

Furthermore he didn't say he didn't have a clue.  He said that he personally, beyond a loss of interest, hadn't felt the hit.  Well that's fair enough.  Some areas, some careers, some people, some positions won't have been hit nearly as noticeably hard.  He can't help that if he's one of the fortunate ones.

Anyway Supermassive Games have said:

&gt; We are delighted to be working with the BBC on such an iconic TV property, and to continue to support Sony’s platforms exclusively by developing Doctor Who: The Eternity Clock as a high-quality PSN title for Playstation3 and for the launch of Sony’s new Vita handheld gaming device. The game is currently in development and set to launch in early 2012.

BBC Press release:

&gt; ""Doctor Who: The Eternity Clock will immerse gamers in the universe of Doctor Who, allowing them to take on the role of the Doctor and River Song as they travel across time and space to save the Earth. Gamers must learn to master the complexities of time travel with exceptional time based game play, changes made in one time will impact another creating multiple possibilities and challenging players to solve puzzles across the centuries.  
 
&gt; A wholly new storyline has been developed especially for this new Doctor Who console game franchise, written in collaboration with the BBC Wales team. Photo-real graphics, television quality scenes and highly realistic characters will bring the world of Doctor Who to life immersing fans completely in the twists and turns of an action filled plot. The stars of the series Matt Smith (the Doctor) and Alex Kingston (River Song) have recorded full voiceovers for their characters in Doctor Who: The Eternity Clock and motion capture has been used to create in-game characters that are incredibly realistic providing the ultimate Doctor Who gaming experience.""

It needn't be mutually exclusive, and in the vast majority of the case, with very few exceptions, it is incredibly good for the country.  Number One financial centre in the world.  There's not a single city that wouldn't want that.  There's not a single developed or emerging country that wouldn't want it for their own country and the United Kingdom has it.  Of course a thriving financial centre is good for the country.

More importantly David Cameron stood up this week for PrimeMinister's questions and said that if it wasn't a good deal for the UK he would not sign.  He said that he was willing to negotiate a true EU reform but he needed France and Germany to recognise protocol to protect UK interests.  They refused, so he did what he said he'd do in front of the House of Commons.  This uninformed Tory, Tory, Tory bashing for the sake of it is derisory, ill-informed and unproductive.  In this case Cameron got stuck in and followed through.

I would like some sort of independent fan-organization run group (ie, SOS works alongside similar groups from other clubs) could work with the FA towards creating and issuing a certain set of rules towards fan/player interaction and enforcing those rules.

I take no offense to a player flicking off the home fans - it means the fans played their part in helping the squad by throwing the player off his game - but things like Hillsborough or Munich chants do need to go and should receive attention and punishment from the FA, especially if they're going to fan players for reacting.",0,1323445784,null,0,false,0,c36kytk,t3_n6azs,t1_c36kytk,t3_n6azs,1427995851,3,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,3

You live in it.  A private or public company owns the rest as holding asset, and you're provided by occupation law.

As an exercise I went to RightMove to find entry level properties in  commuting distance of the major cities, in nice parts of the country.  Ideally with ongoing renovation and investment.  I found a property an hour on the train from London for around £50k in Ipswich, a city in itself, and new 1 and 2 bedroom waterside apartments in Chester, a city with a massive economy of its own (one of the most beautiful) with major ongoing investment and less than an hour from both Liverpool and Manchester, ranging from £25k to £50k. There's an awesome one bedroom apartment in Leeds for £50k...cancel that...here's a two bedroom apartment in the new 20:20 House in Leeds proper for less than £30k.

Holy shit.  They're everywhere!

£30-50k for a really nice two bedroom apartment [here](http://www.rightmove.co.uk/property-for-sale/property-35475494.html#backListLink=%2Fproperty-for-sale%2Ffind.html%3FlocationIdentifier%3DREGION%255E96885%26maxPrice%3D60000%26minBedrooms%3D2%26displayPropertyType%3Dflats%26primaryDisplayPropertyType%3Dflats%26oldDisplayPropertyType%3Dflats%26oldPrimaryDisplayPropertyType%3Dflats%26radius%3D0.25) or [here](http://www.rightmove.co.uk/property-for-sale/new-homes/property-20884881.html)...in fact the more I look equity sharing in the UK by both the public and private sector is. Absolutely.  Everywhere.  Some are only asking for 5% deposits too. 

So even today when somebody says they can't get on the property ladder it either means they aren't willing to travel, commute or move, that or they shouldn't be allowed a mortgage anyway, because £30k for a city centre apartment that can even be split with a flatmate/partner isn't a lot.

That 1 season we almost went under hit us hard. Thankfully our creditors agreed to accept 10p in every £1 owed that kept us afloat and Todd has done a remarkable job in turning the club around, and making it into a nights ""entertainment"" for the family.

Yes, the cuts are harming many public services that improved under Labour. But Labour funded these services by borrowing, not by increasing government revenue - this is unsustainable.

This rule means that the only forms of action you can take to prevent an economic collapse are austerity moves like budget-cutting and reducing benefits and public services. You absolute cannot spend more than you earn on stimulus measures e.g. investing in infrastructure and creating jobs. 

This is significant as it's apparently ""Keynesian policy"" which is the theory that governments should even out the boom-bust cycles of capitalism by saving in the good years, and deficit spending in the bad years.

""Keynesian economics"" is seen as ""good"" at  least by the left as rather than austerity measures which leave the poor to starve you can try to shove the economy back onto track. It's seen as ""bad"" by the right as can lead inflation which is the bane of financial markets.

Inflation is a bad thing because it reduces the value of large capital stockpiles (hence the financial sector not liking it) and for the same reason it harms those on fixed incomes as the buying power of their cash is reduced, in the longer term it can destabilize the economy as the cost of living rises so do wages which in tern feeds back into higher inflation and thus the economy overheats and makes it less competitive that other markets.

true,angelkimne,null,null,"My understanding, admittedly weak;

In hard financial times, with a large national debt, there are two extreme solutions for governments to look to. 

The Keynesian answer is to use the powers of government to boost aggregate demand and stimulate the economy - get it back into action. This might mean large construction projects, expanding the public sector, bailing out or otherwise aiding the private sector, lowering taxes... Often, this will mean borrowing large amounts to run a budget deficit (whereby the government collects less revenue than it spends). The idea is that by stimulating the economy, bust will soon turn to boom, and in times of boom the state will be able to pay off its debts. Makes sense, right?

Hayekians will disagree. They rally against such state interference, and believe that the economy will by nature revert to equilibrium. The economy is volatile, and there will always be times of bust and times of boom - the important part is that it will always fix itself eventually. Attempting to cheat the cycle through such aforementioned measures is unsustainable. Without tackling the problems behind the problems, you will likely just delay the inevitable.

The EU is now demanding that countries run a balanced budget and tackle the problems behind the problems (inefficient and oversized public sectors being an example), rather than taking the Keynesian, expansionist route by attempting to borrow and spend themselves out of trouble.

The Sun at the time ran a story saying the Liverpool fans had looted the dead, urinated on the police helping them, etc.. It was a complete lie and fabrication. A number of the supporters had been doing their utmost to help people climb down from the stand where the crush occurred and were using the advertising billboards around the pitch as stretchers for the injured.

true,tpw4,null,null,"The idea of the USA being like a sleazy, mustachioed older man prowling around the bars of Europe looking for vulnerable, rebounding nation states would be funny if it wasn't somewhat feasible. I am pretty wary of expressing any opinions at this stage, as today's developments have given me much reason to pause for thought. The sheer complexity of all of this is overwhelming.

Nonetheless, the idea of the UK being open to a lot of American influence is not new, as I'm sure you're well aware. My own knowledge of the period between the establishment of American hegemony in Western Europe in the postwar period and the beginning of Margaret Thatcher's tenure is not strong, so forgive me if I am overlooking anything but I believe that 1956's Suez crisis is the last time that the UK made a serious breach of etiquette in its relationship with the US. As a result it is tempting to ask what more influence the United States could want in British affairs. The UK government has dutifully adopted neoliberal economic policies and has supported American foreign policy whenever asked. We could not be considered an unruly ally in any sense, and have broken with other European powers whenever necessary. My feeling (for what it's worth) is that as a result of the UK's historic unwillingness to associate with Europe the events of this week will not provoke any real change in the way that the US deals with us. 

In the event that one of these far-right extremist Republican candidates gets into power next year (unlikely) then there could be some more political pressure on the UK government to be enact more socially conservative policies, but that is difficult to envisage and would not really serve any purpose. The US exerts its influence by controlling the institutions that command the global economy and by having an enormously well-equipped military, and the UK is in total compliance with the wishes of both. 

Just as a side note and because I am in the unusual position of being able to speak to another Europhile Briton, I would like to suggest that the best thing the UK can do to enhance European unity is to leave the EU as soon as possible and accelerate into the isolated decline that our xenophobic population have been crying out for.

true,warmans,null,null,"I think you would not excite employers with this CV. It's ""boring"" which isn't to say you're a boring person but nothing jumps off the page.

Few more specific points: 

""Finished as a “Programming technician”."" - This looks bad because double quotes are used to show that something might not necessarily be what it's named... if that makes sense. For example McDonalds cheese burgers contain ""cheese"".


&gt; As my final project within three weeks combining HTML, CSS, PHP, jQuery and MySQL created a website where people could submit Firm business card info."" 


This isn't well written and doesn't make a lot of sense. I don't understand from this sentence what you actually built. I'd also be suspicious of the ""three weeks"" part as in the UK a degree level final year project takes place over months rather than weeks. Saying you did it in weeks makes me think that you just left it to the last minute rather than you did it quickly. I'd probably just leave out the timescale. A better sentance would be ""For my final year project I created a business contact management system using PHP, MySQL, CSS, HTML and jQuery.""


&gt; Based my knowledge of programming languages learned MySQL and PHP.


This doesn't make sense. It probably doesn't belong in education and in fact the previous sentence already says you know PHP and MySQL.


&gt; Depending on my existing knowledge of Pascal, HTML, CSS learnt Basic, Delphi, and C.


Again, this isn't a well formed sentence. I'd probably move this stuff out of education into a general skills section.


Education doesn't really need to say much beyond where you went and what grade you got at the end of it. If you did individual units you could list them (e.g. Networking - 2.1)


&gt; Went to clients homes to fix their computers, reinstall their Operating Systems, install routers or fix any other kind of IT related problems.


""General IT support including hardware, software and network problems"" would be more succinct.


&gt; Gathered  specifications for design and content of custom built websites.


This is confusing because my first question would be ""did you also build the websites?"". Either way it could be better written as something like ""Worked as part of a web development team to discover client requirements and produce specifications"" ... if that's what you did.


&gt; Added merchandise to their E-shop.


You don't need to be this specific - ""Maintenance of company eCommerce sites"" would be better perhaps.


&gt; The whole IT section


This isn't very good. Like I said before most of your skills should be listed under this section instead of education. 


I'd probably go for something more like:


Skills: 

* Programming languages including PHP, C, Delphi, basic and Pascal.

* Web development skills in HTML, CSS, Javascript (including jQuery).

* Database design using MySQL.

* Design skills in Photoshop/Adobe Creative Suite

* PC Hardware support/troubleshooting.

* Server maintenance.



That being said one specific mistake from your document is that ""programmes"" would refer to e.g. television programmes. ""Programs"" would be correct for software but i'd probably say ""applications"".


Other things: 


Move nationality, driving licence and languages to the top under your person details.


&gt; All kinds of technology related news.


Remove this part. Everyone reads tech news. Maybe move the part about hosting/maintaining game servers here.


Finally:


I am drunk-ish so I'd take my points with a pinch of salt. That being said - as you're applying for jobs in Manchester the person reading your CV will most probably be drunk also.

true,BraveSirRobin,null,null,"&gt; Make some guy like a group he irrationally hates? [snip] If racism/homophobia/religious hatred could be cured by a psychologist or was a recognised mental illness you'd be on to something. Is this your belief?

Yes, not so far as a ""mental illness"" but it is caused by the perpetrators psychology. This sort of intolerance is almost always caused by ignorance. I would expect that most racism comes from those who have never known anyone of the group they are attacking. AFAIK there is considerably more racism in white-only suburbs than there is in areas with a more varied community. There is also more hatred towards groups that tend to be quite insular for this same reason.

As to how to actually ""treat"" this, well that's better left to people that know far more about psychology than I do. It's far easier to prevent in future generations. 

&gt; so there;s nothing for it but to lock up a known racist nutter for a little longer.

Personally I don't think prison should be focussed on punishment as much as it is today. When it comes to sentencing the judge always considers motives and in my personal opinion a meaningless random attack against anyone is just bad as it indicates a serious problem in the criminals life. In this case locking them up becomes a matter of public safety. But if you can't work on fixing the root cause of their violence then you might as well accept that they'll be in and out of prison all of their life with a long string of unnecessary victims produced during their probationary periods. At that point we might as well just lock them up forever to avoid any further victims as they will always be a threat to the greater community. 

Additionally, a lot of what is considered a ""hate crime"" is simply because the victim was a minority. If the perpetrator has a history of violence against anyone (as almost all of these ""yobs"" do) then I think we should be careful when we jump to the conclusion that it was a racially motivated attack. This is even despite when they use racist verbal abuse during the attack. If they happened to be beating up or verbally abusing a fat kid the following night they'd mention that, same with ginger hair, looking like a goth or any number of things. Some people are just violent thugs that get off on picking on others, particularly when they outnumber them. IMHO the first step to fixing any problem is understanding it, so getting the motive wrong like this is not the correct way to go.

I don't like the idea of my country being run by people who aren't from it, it just doesn't sit right with me. It brings with it the risk of us getting screwed over (for example, that financial tax that we just refused, that would have crippled us financially had we agreed)

Plus I don't like the Euro. The fact that joining it would mean sharing a currency with the PIIGS aside, I find it a dull, lifeless currency. The pound is something with a lot of history and personality behind it, and I find the idea of ditching it for borg money with bridges on it distasteful.

true,wrothish,silence,Silence,"I was annoyed by fancrushing when I was a teenage female sci-fi fan. Now, more than a decade later, I just live and let live/lust. 

The character of the Doctor is an ancient alien entity and doesn't have sexual interactions with humans, so I don't really evaluate the actor's sexiness while in character. I do find Tenny and Smith interesting and somewhat attractive, though, and this adds to my enjoyment when watching Confidential episodes. 

I think part of being completely comfortable with one's own sexuality is not being threatened by other people's expression of theirs. When I was younger, I felt that other squee-ing fans demeaned my primarily intellectual interest in the material. 

Now I fantasize about who I want to fantasize about, watch what I find interesting, and generally don't give a fuck what other people think about it. I'd never have watched Stargate SG-1 if not for Browder's spectacular hotness in Farscape. Conversely, I love Burn Notice even though I don't find Donovan or Bell particularly attractive, but many other fans do. 

Sounds like fan interactions are the short term irritant here, and that's something I completely understand. There are a lot of obnoxious people IRL and online. If you feel ""lumped in"" with people you don't like, I say take a break from fandom. Keep your favorite shows as a private happy thing free of other voices and assumptions for a while.
