true,amemus,tardis,TARDIS,"Hah, Ireland is still closer than where I am across the pond; I happened to be studying in Italy, realised I was mere hours away from London, and said ""fuck class"" and went for it.

I'd never gone to a stage door before and I felt like a dick for doing it, but it made me inexpressibly happy to take blurry cellphone pictures of their heads. I have to admit, I was more hoping to Tate's autograph than Tennant's, since she's so great on stage *and* on screen, but no luck.

But I got the autographs of some of the astounding characters in other roles, though not that fantastic Don John. One of them asked if I'd seen the show and I was surprised - it must suck already to see your coworkers be mobbed by fans, but to sign pity-autographs for people who have never even seen you perform? I told him he was an excellent Beruchio, a take on the character I hadn't seen before, and of course I'd seen the show.

I wish they *had* set up a separate queue for people who'd bought tickets, though. And usually the English are so good at queues.",0,1316135036,null,0,false,0,c2k7a8f,t3_kgeq9,t1_c2k7a8f,t1_c2k77vi,1428193965,1,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,1

It started out rather boring, then somebody invented time travel - It's all a giant game with the universe growing more complex based on feedback from the future, in order to maximize the complexity of existence.  Sort of a chaos theory kind of thing, where you get unexpected emergent patterns from a simple start.

As for how the cause/effect thing works, it's a first past the post system.  Whoever goes back in time and changes something has that change and its effects propagate from that time and place at the speed of light.  If that happens to intersect the time traveller's personal past, he just got shunted to an alternate reality.  If it doesn't, the change exists in the same reality.

Timelords were clever enough to figure out how to fix things and get bumped back to their original reality whenever they mess up, or get messed up.  They've engineered themselves so they can 'see' differences between the reality they're in and Reality Prime.  And fixed points in time are points common across all realities as far as that sense can 'see'... which means they aren't really fixed, they're just terribly difficult to alter and it probably isn't a good idea to try.

Men aren't told that violence against them is their fault. They aren't told that they shouldn't have been walking alone, etc.

&gt;Men are the outliers of the species in pretty much ass aspects of life &amp; society. They're more violent, brilliant, risk taking, etc. Just the way it is. Dulling our nature in terms of culling violence has the tendency to dulling other aspects of masculinity. There's no better illustration of this than what's happening in our school systems.

So what you're saying is that by curbing violent tendencies, were hurting men? Didn't you just say men are the ones who get hurt the most in violent crimes? Wouldn't you want those violent tendencies to be curbed? I also take issue with 'brilliant'. I met some men who were as sharp as a river rock. Brilliant depends on the person, not the gender.

I think my perception of him is very much shaped by the fact that he has far more direct interaction with children than Ten ever did; about half of the episodes in seasons 5 and 6 directly or indirectly involve kids, and so eleven feels gentler somehow, like a father figure or the coolest elementary teacher you could possibly imagine.

But at the same time, he can be more manipulative and secretive. I think he can also be really rude and inconsiderate, too -- in particular I'm thinking of the first scene with young Amy in the kitchen. I think in that scene he acted very immature and very un-Doctor-like, and it's always bothered me a bit.

By the end of his first episode I was reassured that the show is at its best when things change.

Like Four, Eleven has a slightly odd look about him that doesn't seem to correlate with his previous incarnation.  He is simultaneously unpredictable and reliable, heroic and dangerous, brand new and ancient.

Kenny's decisions to get rid of Meireles and Aquilani, as well as to bench Maxi, do indeed make it seem like he is a tactical dinosaur who wants to play a physical ""British"" style of play rather than a more fluid one. Some may argue that his lineups last year provide evidence against this, but I believe that last year's injuries forced him into playing the more fluid style.

The most interesting point I found was the author's idea of the frailty of the ""Carroll"" system. If Lucas or Adam or Downing goes down, then it won't work the way Kenny envisions. Problematically, it is Carroll who has gone down to Kuyt through poor form.  With Kuyt and Suarez up top, we are better suited to the continental, fluid playing style.

I am particularly interested to see how Gerrard's return affects this situation. Will he make the hopeful long pass or the clever short one?

It would seem logical that the any producer of any show provide avenues by which they can continue shows as long as possible by creating loopholes through which to do so... i.e. stating there was a limit to Time Lords regenerations, then showing it wasn't set in stone; creating the potential drama were the show to get to our hero's end but depending on ratings allow it to side step the previously set limitations if need be.

http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/feedarticle/9849507


Two pubs are closing in Britain every day, reflecting a ""perfect storm"" of tax increases, cheap supermarket promotions and lack of support for licensees, according to a report.

A study by the Campaign for Real Ale (Camra) found that almost double the number of pubs which are ""tied"" to a company - so-called pubcos - are closing compared to others.

Camra said tied pub licensees were prevented from buying beer on the open market, having to pay up to 45% more than their competitors.

""The number of tied pubs has fallen by 3,216 since 2008 as the large pub companies have failed to support their licensees through tough times.

""The positive news, reflected in the Good Beer Guide, is that the number of free of tie pubs actually increased in number by 425 over the same period,"" said Camra.

Roger Protz, editor of the Good Beer Guide, said: ""These figures show a spiralling decline in the tied pub sector, brought about by big pubcos squeezing their licensees with high beer prices and creating an environment where many publicans are unable to invest in their businesses.

""While many tied publicans struggle in the face of high rents and excessive beer prices, free of tie owners are faring better in the current climate with the ability to offer greater beer choice, lower prices and a better pub environment to the consumer.

""Free of tie pubs, managed pubs and tied pubs run on a more sustainable basis by the family brewers are much more likely to survive and continue serving communities long into the future.""

Camra called on the Government to introduce free market reforms to help save the nation's pubs.

Paul Maloney, national officer of the GMB union, said: ""Jobs in pubs are being lost needlessly every day. City financial engineering has pushed the price of a pint 80p higher than justified by inflation, pushing local pubs out of business. Everything the City touches involving the public seems to have the Midas touch in reverse.""",0,1316151824,null,0,false,0,c2k96so,t3_kgp4p,t1_c2k96so,t3_kgp4p,1427606749,1,false,Edinburgh,t5_2rffi,1

I was cool with the idea of a standalone episode following that, unfortunately it was a disappointing one. My big problem though, is The Girl Who Waited.

Not only that, but TGWW felt like it came a year too late. That would have been a brilliant way to cement the Ponds' relationship in the eyes of the viewer, but their love is long-since established already, so it felt like going over old ground to me. I felt that it dragged on at times, as well. The concept was great, and the core of the episode was solid, but really I just kept thinking that it should have come before The Almost People.

Whatever though, hopefully they'll get back to the arc with the next episode, even if it seems unlikely based on the previews.

The second part of the article is basically a long winded way of saying ""all courts draw their power from the Queen, but the Queen isn't legally Queen. This means that *every* court judgement since she was crowned is invalid.""

&gt;The projected 30% fall off in registered voters, weighted towards poorer voters, would require the boundary commission to reduce the number of inner-city Labour seats because the Boundary Commission is required to draw up constituencies with the sole objective of equalising the size of the electorates and not to take into account natural or political borders.

In other words (as I understand it) this would mean that due to a drop in registered voters, the constituencies would increase in size. So there'd actually be *less seats*  for inner city areas, not just less voters in the same number of seats. Never mind that the actual populations of these constituencies would be much bigger than a leafy suburb where everyone's registered to vote.

That doesn't sit right with me. If two areas have 100,000 people eligible to vote (if they'd filled the form in) surely they should both have an MP whether 60% or 90% have registered?",0,1316159175,null,0,false,0,c2k9qf0,t3_kgv83,t1_c2k9qf0,t3_kgv83,1427607010,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

Well, I said possible rather than probable for this reason (however, in sum, the contributions of philosophers and ""non-applied"" scientists to the development of science are legion and without any shadow of a doubt fundamental) - there would be no engineering nor industrial revolution nor development of the West without the contributions of non-applied scientists.  There would be no reformation nor enlightenment without them.  And many many many practical and (shock horror) commercial applications of science are wholly dependant on the development of a broader education - both within and outside of the natural sciences - which didn't even necessarily touch on those things which would be taught by a purely ""practical"" applied science academy.

And yes, I'm certainly not devaluing the idea of sponsors and patrons to the sciences or any other subject, but you must confess that that approach dramatically limits the scope of the field to be researched - which is precisely the antithesis of what we're discussing - the development of new areas of research which may not initially nor ever be advantageous to those who might have the resources to fund.

I think it's pretty obvious that Liverpool's formation for the foreseeable future is a 4-3-2-1. I agree with your placement of Carroll in the withdrawn striker position, I made a comment on it awhile back but am lazy to search for it now. I think putting Carroll in that position gives him a lot more flexibility to perform, and it cuts down on the rest of the team hoofing high balls at him. He can hold the ball or knock it down for Kuyt or Suarez, so it might work better than what we have tried with him so far. 

Suarez on the right so that he has room to run. He will be able to switch around freely with Downing as well as Kuyt, resulting in more movement along the frontline and hopefully pulling the defenders way out of position. 

I find Henderson's decision making on his passing a little too cautious, so I would rather not have him and Lucas in the center. I think Adam deserves another chance. He needs time to adapt, and a big match like this is great for a big match player like Adam to perform. 

Replacing Carragher with Coates is going to be controversial (tommughan will probably come after me for this one), but Carragher has been a little disappointing lately. Two mistakes in the last two games that resulting in us conceding two goals. Some may argue that it is unreasonable to throw Coates a debut on such a big match but I think it will do wonders for his confidence. The boy played in the Copa America final, so nerves are unlikely. He is also big and tall, and will be able to counter Adebayor in the air. One thing I like about Coates is that not only does he pass the ball, when he hoofs the ball for a clearance, he kicks it high but not too far. This gives the midfield and strikers time to get in position to receive the ball. Most defenders just hit the ball as far as possible, and that just gives the ball away. 

I'm putting Skrtel on the right as I have a feeling Kelly is probably still a week away from full fitness. With Johnson out for a month, it will be folly to risk an aggravation and long term injury to Kelly as well. Skrtel is good enough on the right. 

I would rather not risk Gerrard. Put him on the bench, but not play him unless we are down, or cruising to a 3-0 victory. With the loss of Meireles and Aquilani, we don't want to lose Gerrard for another half a season to injury.

this basically never happens.

i'm not saying that hte issues i listed all come down to discrimination and that all women's issues are not about discrimination.

Rather that for women, any disparity that is unfavourable to then is 100% because of discrimination, yet when the disparity is unfavourable to men that then somehow becomes and egalitarian accomplishment.

Feminists talk about patriarchy as a system that systematically discriminates against them.

Yet when i think of a group of chauvinist social engineers, intent on imposing their ideological perception of gender on everyone else, guess who comes to mind.

As such, many of these disparities have come about because women's issues, however petty and irrelevant have been inflated while men's issues have been concistently ignored or even celebrated as proof of feminist achievement.

[Actually, it very well might be.](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2006/11/section/2) Just because Smiths are selling it doesn't mean Smith's aren't breaking the law. Also:

**Terrorism Act 2000, Section 57:**
&gt;57 Possession for terrorist purposes.

&gt;(1)A person commits an offence if he possesses an article in circumstances which give rise to a reasonable suspicion that his possession is for a purpose connected with the commission, preparation or instigation of an act of terrorism.

&gt;(2)It is a defence for a person charged with an offence under this section to prove that his possession of the article was not for a purpose connected with the commission, preparation or instigation of an act of terrorism.
**
Terrorism Act 2000, Section 2:
**

Explanatory notes for the above:
&gt;Subsection (2)provides the conduct that will amount to an offence under section 2. The conduct is: *distributing or circulating a terrorist publication*; *giving, selling, or lending* a terrorist publication; offering a terrorist publication for sale or loan; providing a service to others that enables them to obtain, read, listen to or look at such a publication, or to acquire it by means of gift, sale, or loan; transmitting the contents of a terrorist publication electronically; and possessing a terrorist publication with a view to making it available in any of the ways listed. This means that the offence will cover not only bookshops but also those that sell books and publications over the internet whether the publication is in hard copy or electronic. It will also cover libraries and the distribution of leaflets and flyers.

&gt;Subsection (3)sets out the definition of terrorist publication. A publication will be considered a terrorist publication if it meets one of two tests. The first test is if matter contained in it is likely to be understood by some or all of the persons to whom it is or may become available as a consequence of the conduct in subsection (2) as a direct or indirect encouragement or other inducement to the commission, preparation or instigation of acts of terrorism. The second test is if it contains any matter which is likely to be useful in the commission or preparation of such acts and it is likely to be understood by some or all of the persons to whom it is or may become available as being contained in the publication, or made available to them, wholly or mainly for the purposes of being so useful to them.

Section three reads like **anything** could be a ""terrorist publication"" to me, as the test is ""If someone wanted to use the information in this to carry out a terrorist act, would it help them do it?"". Which is very broad.

This missed the point, which is that there is no consequence for bad actions. We've tried a respectful style, and that doesn't work either.

I'm for corporal punishment, as a stern measure. Other punishments like detention, suspension mean nothing. There has to be a meaningful deterrent that at least makes kids think twice. At the moment, they can do WTF they like and the teacher can do fuck all to stop them.

But for example, if voting were compulsory, and voter registration compulsory, so that it was very difficult (and illegal) to avoid being on the voters register, and then jurors were chosen from that voter's register. This would stop most people from thinking: ""Oh, I shan't register to vote, because then I might have to do jury duty."" You'd still have some who illegally avoided being registered to vote, but I think there would be less such people.

An unrealistic solution, that just exists to show you that the current situation isn't ideal would be to have some government agency completely separate from the electoral officials who are devoted to compiling a list of people for possible jury duty.

Another way would be to have no list beforehand, but have some actuaries or something work out what a randomly selected group of people would look like. Then you'd send letters to, say 1000 random addresses asking people to report for jury duty. From the 500 (say) who turned up, you'd try and select a representative sample (using the criteria given to you by your actuaries) of 100 people, who are such that if you'd started with the voter list and chosen from it at random, you could have easily ended up with a sample like this. From the 100 you'd randomly select 12 for the jury.

One thing to consider going forward with season 5 and into now season 6 is that scientific theory is thrown out the door.  Moffat does a great job developing scripts and making an intense story he does so without thinking about the theoretical science, like paradoxes, that was held so highly under Russel T. Davies (Series 1-4 and Tennant Specials). 

In the end the reason why I enjoyed watching Tennant so much more probably comes down to the fact that I enjoy story lines that goes with science instead of against it but if you are one for a good story without a big concern for scientific correctness than you will absolutely love the newest seasons and Matt Smith.

He has refused the publication of spin-off novels and comic books that have tried to definitively link the two.[2]

Officially it is, but to a lot of those who would consider themselves British or Northern Irish, there is no such thing as the island of Ireland. Ireland is what lies beneath NI and calling the entire island 'Ireland' serves no purpose whatsoever.

&gt;Therefore if you live in NI you still live on the island of Ireland and can be described as ""Irish""

You could argue that living on the island doesn't mean that you are living in Ireland itself though. Surely there is more to declaring yourself Irish than just happening to live in a country that used to be part of Ireland?

I think Jack will go the same route.

(See what I did there?)  In that metaphor, ""above the water"" means ""in our spacetime"" and below that is inside the Vortex.  When the Police Box dematerializes, it's like that section is retracting into the Vortex to poke out again at another location in spacetime -- like the tip of an iceberg sinking below the water to bob up again at another spot later.

I think what we're seeing is that Liverpool are firmly in the margin of error where bad luck can see us fall behind the Mancs and Chelsea. Man Utd and City so far have been so far ahead of their opponents that bad luck (whatever they've had, anyway) hasn't been enough to stop them. Chelsea will drop points, but have the matchwinners to overcome it. We have a team that can compete with anyone when it's at its best, but can slip behind when things don't go our way in terms of form/fitness/injuries/refereeing. The positive to take from that is that we're 1 or 2 stars away from being able to field an 11 every week that can compete with anyone in England. Secure CL football and we'll be able to attract the couple names we need to make it a legitimate top 4.

but from what I understand of it is this

British does not necessarily mean England, Scotland and Wales (that is merely the collective Great Britain). British is a cultural identification for anybody in the remaining British Empire (notice it is called the British Empire). For example during the raj an Indian may have called himself British or Indian, to call yourself British in India meant you were cut from better clothe and had more of a link to the UK than your home country.

Like wise Ireland, from what I interpret, is the landmass combination of Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. You can call yourself Irish without being born in the south just as you can call yourself British without being born in Great Britain so long as you were born in an active British territory.

Even native Falklanders consider themselves British.

true,[deleted],null,null,"Give the first four or so episodes a shot before you plunk down cash, but it's a great show. I must admit before continuing that I love children's TV, and still occasionally watch Wonderpets and Sesame Street at 24.

SJA is more consistently good than DW. The best episodes aren't quite as good as say, ""Midnight,"" or ""Human Nature/Family of Blood,"" but the stinkers are rare and much less bad than DW's. The endings are usually happier, but often it feels like much more is at stake because it's through the eyes of teenagers who are worried about their moms and dads.

Though alien tech is used to save the day, this show is all human beings finding and stopping alien threats. It is as such much more humanistic than DW and a lot more inspiring to me for that reason. The Doctor's an inspiration, and pitches in every now and then, but most of the legwork in the early seasons is done by kids who've never even seen him.

Luke is probably the biggest ""problem"" with the show. He's basically Wesley Crusher done right. The awkward and the difference between his intellectual and emotional IQ is played up, and his insufferable genius is played as a tool to be used rather than a panacea for all problems. He is a much nicer person than most kid geniuses are in these shows, too, which helps. I identify with him.

Another slight issue is that the adults in the show can be immature. While occasionally awkwardly done, this is usually pretty realistic, and shows how some people really don't grow up. The only times it gets weird are before we meet Clyde's dad, as up until then we only see flightly moms, and when Sarah Jane has her odd moment of immaturity. To her and the writers' credit, when she's immature it's almost ALWAYS directly correlated to issues from her childhood when she would have been that immature, and she shows a lot more restraint and regret about it that similarly tempted DW characters.

Basically, I really liked SJA, and it is the single most intelligent children's show I have ever watched.

The New York Times is the only other media outlet to have uncovered any major information about the case, and the Met only launched a proper investigation in direct response to new allegations from the media.

I don't think it's true, either, that the names of celebrities who were hacked were bought by the Guardian. Police sold other information to the tabloids (one case I remember was the address and phone number of a victim of sexual assault by a footballer), but the extent of phone hacking was pretty clearly leaked through the connection you mention between Amelia Hill and a police officer. If you can provide evidence that demonstrates otherwise I'd be interested to see it.

I think you have failed to make the appropriate distinction between invasion of privacy in pursuit of an important story, and invasion of privacy in pursuit of tittle-tattle. It's probably true that the Guardian does engage to some degree in the 'dark arts', but only as a last resort, and only in pursuance of genuine stories. You can see that in the Motorman investigation, which recorded the number of requests to a particular PI, and had 950 from the Daily Mail, 300 from the NOTW, and 2 from the Guardian. To lump the Guardian's actions in with the NOTW is like equating the breaking of the Giggs injunction with the Trafigura toxicity report injunction. The distinction between one and the other is perfectly clear-cut, and easily legislated for.

This perspective is perfectly valid, but so is the opposing Nationalist perspective. I think a lot of it comes down to education. Catholics are taught in schools about Irish history, Irish culture and mythology and study the Irish language in secondary school. They play traditional Irish sports like gaelic football and hurling. Protestants are taught British history and culture. They focus more on British sports like football and rugby. Protestants fly the Union Jack and stand to ""God save the Queen"". Catholics fly the tricolour and stand to ""Soliders Song"". So to Protestants the distinction between NI and the ROI is a great one, to Catholics the distinction is virtually non-existent. Who is to say that one perspective is more valid than the other? I think it's a great shame that religious segregation in NI has created two communities who are so ignorant of each other.

He then responded, ""I think you'll find that 'after 1939' and '1939' are two different things entirely"" but then the klaxon blared ""**After World War Two**"".

He continued, ""Oh no, no, no! 'After 1939' and 'After World War Two' are in no way synonymous"". The klaxon blared ""**During World War Two**""

David then said, ""This is silly, you're just typing what I say. I wouldn't be surprised if 'Mitchell is a knob' came up!""

true,Ashiro,cnty-england,England,"No - definitely not and here's why:

 * You don't know the situation.
 * If the person gets injured you're liable and don't think the police will back you up - they'll let you take the blame to cover themselves. See my post about citizens arrest [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/khgqn/would_you_help_the_police/c2kgalo).
 * What if it was a case of police brutality or corruption that you just helped with (it does happen)?
 * If the person is a member of a gang you could become the target of revenge attacks.
 * You could become the target when they're released on bail or from prison.
 * You could get yourself injured.
 * The situation could escalate well out of control. For example: The offender may have a knife on them which they aren't using because they feel they may manage to escape without it. When Mr Hero comes to the rescue he realises he'll have to act quick, pulls the knife and guts the pair of you before you can lay a finger on him.
 * The police officer could misinterpret your actions and try and fend you off, letting the other person loose.
 * The police don't expect you too help and in fact would prefer it if you didn't. The fact your situation turned out ok doesn't mean they want people getting involved.
 * Really, why bother? If they escape the person will very likely get found at a friend or family members house only a few hours later. You will hardly be saving the day by keeping them out of hiding for a few hours. All this risk and for what?

Well written. You've got a real point about happiness and independence. Can they not go hand in hand? At the least, the Present Amy definitely has, with her personality, the potential to be the ""woman with a sword"". Though for the record, Tom MacRae wrote this episode, not Steven Moffat. I think that this story is probably more reflective of general views in society rather than Steven Moffat (who shares these views).

After all, youth is glorified now and women still have that general stigma of ""get married and be a mom"". That's why all commercials selling kid's food have a happy at home mom to make them their favorite breakfast cereal. Yes, Steven Moffat has a bad view about women. It's not sexist in the typical way, but skewed nonetheless.

What I say about Moffat:

He has a skewed view of women. He's a good writer, he knows how to entertain and his women are all strong characters, but he seems to have a trend of making young women fall in love at a young age and want to get married. Madame du Pompadour, the little girl from the Empty Child/Doctor Dances, Donna in Silence/Forest, River Song of course, Amy to the ultimate degree, Karen Nightingale and Sally Sparrow...

true,ComingUpMilhouse,amy,Amy,"""The thing about Melody's exploration of her ""obvious"" aspects after regenerating is that it's very much in line with how the *Doctor* has reacted after regeneration, especially in the Classic series. The line about the teeth was lifted directly from the Fourth Doctor, who considers himself sharply in the mirror after regenerating, then dives into the TARDIS for a variety of wardrobe changes. Unlike the Doctor, though, River uses the regeneration trope as a ruse, giving her the opportunity to prepare her poison.

As to Amy Pond, well. This is the woman who saved a Star Whale, kept Dr Bracewell from blowing up, defeated an Angel, zapped a vampire with her mirror (her *compact*) to save her boyfriend, negotiated with Silurians on the behalf of the human race, inspired Vincent Van Gogh, did research in the Lodger (a bit Willow if you ask me), and brought the Doctor back to life through the power of her memory and her ability to solve a *riddle*.

This season, though... she's become even more like the Doctor. She is now actively fighting monsters, and becoming like the monsters she fights (which is what the Doctor does up until the end of A Good Man.) She shoots the Apollo, slashes pirates, rallies against the Flesh and is revealed as Flesh, takes a Cleric's gun, sics Antibodies on the crew of the Tesselector (which *depicts* her emotional dissociation about losing her baby), fights and becomes a Doll.

In TGWW, she dons the armor of the robots she fights. She makes her own sonic, understands time streams, even uses the same dialogue as the Doctor: Eyes front, Soldier. Rory complains that the Doctor is making people like him, but it's Amy who's really been transformed.

It seems like the Choice has been taken from Amy's hands, but it's not. *All* of the characters have a choice. First is the Doctor, who shuts the door, behaving as a Threshold Guardian. He then gives the Choice to Rory, and Rory is about to let Older Amy in (he's turning the knob) when Amy wrests the Choice away from him. That's powerful. She wasn't given a choice, she *took it*.

Young Amy? She already made a choice, the choice to sacrifice her older self for Rory's sake. She made, in essence, a choice of self-sacrifice, which is the sine qua non of the Heroic Journey. Her choice isn't entirely selfless, of course... she's just avoided four decades of solitude. That's *smart*.

And isn't it interesting that Rory and both Amys are rendered unconscious at some point. All three of them. Rory goes down first, and he's saved by Amy. Amy goes down next, and she's saved by Rory. And then Amy goes down for the count, in an act of self-sacrifice, and her death is presented with the visual imagery of salvation. She has saved herself, her younger self, saved her from a self-described hell, a life devoid of relationships.""

Anyways, it seems like everyone else here has cleared things up. I find it interesting that it has surprised you and makes me wonder how many other things I'm taking for granted.

I guess I never thought about it because when my friend told me about it she mentioned Doctors and that's when I asked if there were clones or multiples or something. She then explained it to me.

So definitely glad to meet a new fan! Trust me, with every *season* and every *Doctor* you notice leaps in quality. Same with classic Who. I showed my friend three episodes, one from each NuWho Doctor and she made this note. And while there may be leaps, there isn't a single season or Doctor whose time isn't worth watching.

true,Ouro,null,null,"Whether it works out in practice, the idea is that rather than taking the chainsaw to virgin forest and then burning lots of petrol to transport the wood to some distant power station, the fuel is locally grown on “poor” quality land that typically has “little use”. 

The concept is to use [short rotation willow coppicing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short_rotation_coppice) – willow is grown on land not fit for more general agricultural production. It’s a hardy crop that can be grown on bogy and windy land. Thus a power station would have contracts with farmers across their part of the country to supply them with willow.

To imply it’s not carbon neutral is a bit unfair, though strictly true: while the amount of carbon it takes to grow the willow is roughly the same as released as when it’s burnt, harvesting the willow is done by machinery and while it’s a locally produced there is still some transportation involved.

What’s more an interesting question is the biodiversity angle. You’re growing willow on land that would otherwise lie fallow, that for commercial agriculture is “*poor*” and of “*little use*”, however just because we see some wind blasted rushy bog is bleak and uninteresting doesn’t mean that it isn’t necessarily ecologically important. Though of course the willow itself adds a habitat.

As with most things the situation is complex and requires more research or better communicating it's results to the public: Just how carbon neutral is the entire short rotation willow coppicing chain? What is the ecological impact of turning over land to willow production? What of the economic angle will it inevitably lead to the exploitation of biologically important forests? Unfortunately the Guardian article doesn’t really address this and just quotes sound bytes.

Not punishment that is carried out by teachers, but by the parents of the kids. Also, only with a slipper- not a cane; on parts of the body like the thighs.

At schools I often hear ""You can't touch me!"" and a ton of abuse, sometimes physical abuse being hurled at the teachers. The respect is not there, and manipulative kids are using the idea of parents not being able to touch them as a way of doing their own thing.

It should not be used excessively, sparingly if anything. But there should be the *ability* for parents to have means at which to control their children. We shouldn't treat children as adults.

Unless the house is unusually large for a council house, the only issue I can foresee would be over-occupancy, too many people in too small a house. It would be unlikely that you would get permission to formally sublet as you already have (it sounds like) at least 5 adults in the house.

EDIT: I glossed over much of this comment the first time-- but perpetuating *rape culture*? You're kidding right? Someone using the word ""rape"" offhand makes it more likely for women to be raped? If I said ""I could murder a drink right now"" does that make it more likely for people to be murdered? If I said ""I'm going to rob this dead PC of parts before I throw it away"" does that make people more likely to be robbed? Murder and robbery are also two of the most horrific things that can ever happen to a person. No, saying a word in a different context doesn't perpetuate anything except another meaning of a word. Furthermore, I think it's short-sighted of feminists to hold on to this ""rape culture"" idea anyway. If there's any ""culture"" here, it's one of violence or insanity, of which rape is a part.

true,Ashiro,cnty-england,England,"&gt; Lots of reasons trying to justify your cowardice.

Sorry 'mate' but I've fought and beaten, big ugly bastards numerous times in jujutsu, MMA and submission grappling competitions. I've never been one to shy away from a fight when myself or family and friends are threatened. So kindly take those words and shove them up your fucking arse. Now onto the rest of the crap you spewed out.

&gt; How exactly?

Very easy. Go back to the place you got arrested and the person helped. Hang around until they appear. Don't say this is unlikely because I got my car keyed when visiting a friend. It happened between 3 and 5pm on Wednesday. The kids got one hell of a shock when I caught them next Wednesday at ~3pm coming home from school. I didn't even need to know what they looked like. Their reaction alone was enough. They happened to live 2 doors down and owned up as soon as they saw me coming towards them. If I - a law abiding citizen can do it - a hardened criminal easily can. And they have a hell of a lot more motivation than me who just needed to use some T-Cut.

&gt; I have no criminal record and the police have no idea who I am. Just how would they find someone they don't know who isn't on the NPD at a friend or family members house a few hours later?

I'm sorry but you really are naive. If you're in a violent altercation with the police its VERY unlikely you wouldn't have a criminal record already. Law abiding people don't just crash a car and then start punching the police to get away. Someone like that will have a history.

However, lets say they don't. You've got a description, a location, a car they just crashed - find the owners address. If its stolen get CCTV of the area it was stolen in. You've got a description, video, witnesses. In this particular instance you had a woman who'd been beaten - therefore ironclad identification.

There's been 1 murder and a couple of armed robberies in my area in the past 3 years. I think the longest time the criminals managed to keep in hiding was a couple of weeks. The murderers were caught within days. A One Stop shop down the road got robbed by someone with a knife - they got picked up a few days later. These incidents only had third party witnesses and/or grainy CCTV. So you think they'll have a hard time finding this guy?

Similarly, we never saw Ten go ""Hi, I'm the Doctor, and I'm in love with Rose."" But the way the series was written made it very obvious that Ten *was* in love with Rose.

We got to the pub early this morning (watched Arsenal lose, that was nice) and got our entire rig set up to record our show. We had TONS of great material planned out...

And then I couldn't log into my laptop. I don't know WHY I couldn't log in to it. I called our tech support and they said they could reset the password but I would have to travel to the office (some 50 miles from the pub) and physically plug it into a jack for the reset to take effect.

So, ugh, everyone went their separate ways and I went home to record a small 15-minute solo version of the show...

Only to once again come up against the mysterious problem that for whatever reason, when I record on my desktop, at some time around 3 minutes in, the sound quality falls off a cliff. This happened the last solo show and I eventually switched to the laptop; without the laptop I had to keep trying on my desktop. I recorded FIVE fifteen minute shows each with the same problem before I had to give up and put out the 2-minute show that is out there now.

Good news is the laptop will be fixed at work on Monday morning and barring anyone getting struck by lightning - which I am not ruling out at this point - we will be back at full strength and recording on Wednesday night, with the new show releasing by Thursday afternoon.

My apologies again to the folks who were waiting for this - we really appreciate you sticking with the show.

I appreciate that the system from 30 years ago is out of date (pro-bono work for solicitors is effectively mandatory now, and the government could easily have directed that requirement to this, for example) and some people waste money by asking for help for petty legally incontestable matters or when they can afford their own and will use their own for the main trial.


That said, as the article points out, means testing in a police station (which is when you often need the help most, given how self-directed a magistrate's court can be) is completely ridiculous.

At Pin 2, there are two lanes allegedly going straight, but one is labelled as leading to the A19 (which would mean taking the exit), and the other leads to A690 - that's confusing. If you forget about the markings and just extrapolate the generic [Highway Code](http://www.direct.gov.uk/en/TravelAndTransport/Highwaycode/DG_070338) advice on roundabouts, it becomes clearer: you can only exit from the outermost lane, and you should only move into the outermost lane right before your exit.

Here's how I would answer your questions:

1) You're expected to exit if you're in the outer lane after Pin 1.

2) You cannot exit from the middle lane at Pin 2.

3) I would say that if you enter at Pin 1 and want to take the A690, you should stay in the middle lane or move into the outer lane after Pin 3. The outer lane is always for exiting, and the inner lane is always for staying on the roundabout.

4) I wouldn't say that would be illegal, but if you just stopped and waited to merge into the middle lane (and inner lane later on), that would be an awful dick move.

http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2011/sep/14/unemployment-rises-2-5-million

Unemployment at 7.9%
Total unemployment 2.1m
Youth unemployment 972k

Dept of statistics said in Feb 2011 that there were 500k vacant jobs, a statement supported by independent recruitment agencies.

http://recruitment.co.uk/jobs/press-18feb11.html;jsessionid=nfpj6jhrdcw6wy8zycdslh8

Now, Feb to now is a small stretch of time but IDS's statement last month that 1 in 4 of incapacity claimants (totalling 500k) had been deemed to be falsely claiming and could be moved directly into vacancies indicates that the are circa 500k bottom rung jobs sloshing about the economy.... (which kind of concludes our game of swingball... If those roles were filled by 'youth' looking to get any experience youth unemployment would halve)

Now this is where it gets interesting, if we say that there are 60m ppl in the uk, and take out children, retired people and others who can't work, let's make a generous guesstimate and say we have an able potential workforce of 35m.

Let's take the bottom line assumption of 500k jobs, divide that by 35m and we have 0.014 or 1.4%. 

Let's take 1.4% off of the 7.9% total and we have 6.5% unemployment. Economists generally consider a healthy level of unemployment to be between 4-6%.",0,1316293692,null,0,false,0,c2km0jt,t3_kfbys,t1_c2km0jt,t1_c2kjo0w,1427612934,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

The episode's central ideas were a bit of a mess and David Walliams' character the most pointless kind of comic relief. It wasn't terrible or anything, just disappointingly generic and underdeveloped after three significantly stronger episodes.

true,TabascoQuesadilla,mcgann,McGann,"&gt; The universe no longer feels infinite. I feel like we have spent way too much time on earth.

As opposed to RTD, who visited other planets *all* the time...

Wait:

- Series 1: 13 Earth episodes, 0 other-planet episodes (unless you count ""a space station orbiting Earth"" as another planet)
- Series 2: 10 Earth episodes (including 2 alternate-Earth episodes), 1 ""New Earth"" episode (technically another planet, but come in, it's ""New Earth""), 2 other-planet episodes
- Series 3: 9 Earth episodes, 1 earth/moon episode, 1 ""New Earth"" episode, 1 other-planet episode, 1 spaceship episode
- Series 4: 8 Earth episodes, 5 other-planet episodes
- Specials (2005-2010): 5 Earth episodes, 1 spaceship-crashing-into-Earth episode, 2 other-planet episodes (1 of which is in our solar system)

That means (counting New Earth as another planet) exactly 75% of RTD's run takes place on Earth or in a space station orbiting Earth, meaning only 1/4 of his run takes place out among the ""infinite.""

Now let's look at Moffat's (admittedly shorter) run:

- Series 5: 10 episodes on Earth (counting ""The Beast Below"" as future Earth of a sort), 2 on another planet, 1 entirely within the TARDIS (""Amy's Choice"")
- Series 6: 8 episodes on Earth, 1 episode in another universe, 1 on another planet, 1 on an asteroid, and 1 in a sort of space prison (this week's) (I'm not counting episode 13 cos I know nothing about it yet)
- Christmas special (2010): 1 episode on another planet

That means that 31% of Moffat's run takes place off of Earth, compared to RTD's 25%.

Sorry, I wouldn't have bothered with all of that, but one of the things that bothered me so much about RTD's run was how it seemed like *every episode* was on Earth, or New Earth, or an alternate Earth.  Whereas Moffat has given us quite a bit more in terms of alien worlds.

And if you say ""But RTD had a longer run than Moffat,"" I'll agree with you, so let's compare just RTD's first two seasons, minus the last episode of season 2, so it's an exact comparison - the math there boils down to 11%.

That means that, in the same timespan, Moffat has given us almost 3 times as many alien worlds as RTD did.

true,Jeshi,null,null,"I definitely agree that Moffat's arcs are a lot more important to each episode than Davies's.

Take S3 for example and Martha's character arc about neglecting her family. Every episode in S3 up until the three-part finale can stand alone perfectly find in every way. If you were to watch, say, The Lazarus Experiment, as the first episode of S3 you ever saw, you could figure out easily that the people talking to Martha are her family and that she didn't tell them where she was before time traveling.

The episode is very important for the overall plot arc, but it also stands alone perfectly find. We don't need to know who Martha Jones is to understand it. A lot of episodes in S3 are like that, they all focus on Martha Jones's obsession with the Doctor and how she puts it above her family. So in the end, when she realizes that she's never getting anywhere with the Doctor, and that her family needs her more, it was earned and made sense.

S6 is not like that. If you didn't know that Amy Pond waited for the Doctor when she was 7yo, then her greatest fear wouldn't make sense. ""Why does this woman fear a little girl sitting on a briefcase?"" a newcomer would ask, it isn't explained because you're expected to already know.

The episodes in the Moffat era that have important parts of the plot arc in them are more about the plot arc. It's less subtle. You need to have seen previous episodes to enjoy them.

You make good points about how preferences are made to the experienced, qualified and recently unemployed, which I agree with-ish as banking and finance is a good example where the industry used the credit crunch to clear out a lot of deadwood and literally start hiring from a fresh 'talent' pool.... But I digress.

My point was, and our discussion has been about bottom rung jobs. We are talking about jobs which don't have a preference for exp, qualified and recently unemployed. As IDS indicates, a 1/4 of ppl claiming disability are fraudulent will be pushed immediately into vacancies. Whilst ambitious and probably impractical, it does imply that there is a glut of non technical jobs out there which avoid or overlap the slosh of hires and fires in the standard job Market.

You are the one who has formed the bizarre opinion that there is plenty of unskilled work about, you should have the supporting evidence on hand. How else would you have come to the conclusion in the first place?

&gt; We are talking about jobs which don't have a preference for exp, qualified and recently unemployed.

They are rare, and unemployment is high enough that even an unskilled job will have experienced people applying for it. I think the average application rate is something like 50 to a job. 

&gt; As IDS indicates, a 1/4 of ppl claiming disability are fraudulent will be pushed immediately into vacancies.

I'm not sure where you are getting this from. Those kicked off disability benefits (the few that aren't going to tribunal at least) are going on the dole, not into vacancies. Good luck to them if they find a job, but I think they'll just be adding to the claimant count.

&gt; 15 ph to lay bricks. 21k to get trained as an FX Trader. 8ph to drive a cherry picker... Not. Bad. At. All.

Neither of which you could do without experience (the fx trader is an obvious scam). Keep an eye on those jobs and see how long they last. Also note whether they are agency of not. You might try ringing for one to see how far you get. Odds are they will take your details and that is as far as it'll go.

It seems you are not unlucky enough to be out of work at the moment, as it seems you do not know the job market very well.

Also at the beginning of the season who would you least expect to be the one shot the Doctor. Amy, since she was the most effected by it and actually shot at the girl in the spacesuit to prevent the Doctor's death.

But to me the clincher is this line, when the Doctor meets the Astronaut, he said ""It's okay, I know it's you."" I could be looking to much into this but this line makes the two most popular theories seem silly. If the Doctor was in the space suit, this line would make no sense for him to say because both of the Doctor's would know who is in the suit and therefor the line would be a bit worthless (unless your bring a flesh Doctor into the equation which to be honest is a bit of a cop out, unless the Ganger tries to save the Doctor or do something else impressive. I don't know). And if this was child River Song, this line and the little dialogue would make no sense. They don't know each other at that point so why would River respond to that line, lift her mask, let the Doctor talk and then shot him. It seems only Amy would make sense (and to a lesser extent Rory) as it just fits the line and scene better and also makes him saying ""I'm Sorry"" to the group before getting shot again have a bit more significance.

And once you think about Amy's time in the Silence's Tardis and there access to the space suit, it becomes more plausible. It also brings up the point that obviously the series doesn't end here so something needs to change, either the fixed point in time of the Doctor's death or just a perspective change on the entirety of what happened. And if there is anyone who can change destiny (other than the Doctor) it is Amy as she has done it already. The main question I have is how the silence fit in. Again this is all based on one line but why did they make Amy tell the Doctor she was pregnant which put the Doctor in the direction of Madame Kovarian.

Also there was that comment Rory made to Amy (Don't quite remember what it was), and then he looks really frightened and then says ""Oh if I'd said something like that before you would have hit me"". While he may just be reacting to Amy's change of character, I don't think you'd jump that much.

There is also a bit near the beginning of the episode where they go searching the corridors, the Doctor is in the lead and walks past the point where everyone else turns down a different corridor.

true,mistyriver,null,null,"It seemed like it was an episode which was trying to tie up loose ends and prepare the plot for the next events. In that sense, I think that the writer, Toby Whithouse, would have worked closely with Stephen Moffat. 

There seem to have been two goals:

1. to get Amy and Rory off the Tardis, and into their domestic life

2. to reform the Amy character, so she doesn't exhibit the Doctor-worshipping attitude anymore.

&gt; Specifically what made the story bad for you?

I think that a story, in order to be poignant, needs to deal with character development in a somewhat authentic way. It feels like I've been cheated to see Amy change her attitude toward the Doctor suddenly, with no soul searching - simply on the directive of the Doctor - when he and the Tardis feel the need to teach her a little lesson by way of an adventure.

It seems as if the story is almost a mea culpa by Stephen Moffat - and we're seeing the lead writer's character development in relation to his choice of plot direction. He realizes that the premise at the start of last season, with Amy developing the obsession with the Doctor and the subsequent effect on her and Rory of their many adventures might not have worked out as he had hoped. I don't want to see Moffat wear his heart on his sleeve. I just want to see a story that has insights woven into it that I can be inspired by. 

Finally, I'm getting bored with this very typical theme that seems to come up again and again of a bunch of strangers who are facing some kind of threat together, and who need to work out the psychology and the sociology of their group dynamics together. It's always kind of the same story.

42, Night Terrors, Midnight, Flesh and Stone, and the God Complex all seem to me to be pretty much the same story rehashed five times.

Interestingly enough the same plot can become quite inspiring if a little magic is added to it, such as in ""Silence in the Library"" ""Planet of the Ood"" or ""Time of Angels"" or ""Curse of the Black Spot."" When they add history, or folklore, or some lesson that shows us how to rise and embrace our better nature, I thoroughly enjoy the show.

It may have even been more interesting if we had a new companion who happened to see the Doctor die, only to meet him again earlier on his timeline. So then they're just meeting and coming to know the Doctor and all of the wonders, but they also know how he dies and have to decide whether they should tell him. 

Amy's character arc was about growing up and having her wedding, Rory didn't have much of a character arc because his role in the story was to be the perfect husband but very very much *not* the Doctor. 

In S6 I think it's becoming apparent that despite the added focus on Rory, he still doesn't have much to go toward. We've already gotten that he's the most loyal husband in the universe who would wait 1000 years and is the most beautiful man Amy's ever met and he's willing to go on all sorts of adventures just because Amy wants to. And now, assuming they don't come back, Rory just got his happily ever after. He has his favorite car in a nice house with his beloved wife and he can have a second shot at having a kid too, a kid who won't be a time lord psychopath.

He has to continue on flying through all of space and time and being amazed, because if he ever stands still then he has to face everything he's left behind. 

And,of course, he's afraid to lose his companions. He just expressed how afraid he was of losing Amy or Rory. He doesn't want to end up alone, again, because he's screwed up and lost them and ended up with only his own self-loathing for company.

As well, this was in response to a thing saying it is one of the most progressive shows on TV in regard to sexuality and lifestyle. Omitting transsexuality is sort of a tick against that.

And yes, I am aware of these two nods, but one was a villainous character (though definitely not bad in itself, especially because it wasn't played up at all, she's not at all villainous because of her transsexuality) and the other could have been a biological accident as well as a conscious choice. I'd be really happy with some sort of overt positive nod.

So, it would seem that he wants the world's religions to unite and combat atheism with ther key selling points.  But religions already do this routinely: Christianity has a conversion imperative, for example.  Religious faiths have massive, ancient systems and structures behind them which have been designed and refined to convert and then retain believers.  If those are now failing, I'm not sure why banding behind a shared viewpoint - which to him seems to be 'believe or be damned' - will magically work.

He doesn't really seem to realise that atheists aren't part of a single organization, which would of course make it easier to 'combat' them.  You can target the morality and norms of an established organization, but that's not so easy with disparate groups of individuals.

true,[deleted],null,null,"It's not that Celtic signed protestants before Rangers signed catholics, Celtic never discriminated. From it's foundation Celtic was a club open to all.

The club was founded by a Marist monk named Brother Walfred after seeing the example of Hibernian FC in Edinburgh. The club had two aims; to raise money for charity and to provide a focal point to the community in the East End. The new club was to stress the common links between the Irish immigrant community (heavily catholic) and the native scottish community (largely protestant) of the east end. Hence the name ""Celtic""

From its foundation it has always been a club open to anyone regardless of their religion (greatest figure Jock Stein - Protestant, date of first protestant player 28th May 1888). It was one of the few major cultural institutions in Scotland that was very welcoming to Catholics in the late 19th to 20th centuries, because of this it attracted a large catholic support.

It is also worth taking into account the wider context of the place of Catholics in Scottish society. It was not uncommon for institutions (Rangers FC being just one example) to have either open or unspoken 'Catholics need not apply' policies well into the 20th century. The Catholic/Irish community in Scotland was poor, excluded and regarded by many as foreign. This place in society was replicted and entrenched in, by far, the most popular sport in Scotland - football.

Here is, to be honest, the best source of Celtic related news and commentary both footballing and cultural. I highly recommend it. It's alos recently expanding from just the b log and related events to a magazine and YouTube channel:

I disagree. Being human means that you are physically human, not how you view the world. Not everyone has faith in something, just the people that think they need someone else to blame when something goes wrong.

&gt;Faith is what motivates us when all we want to do is give up, to lay down and die. Faith is what lets us overcome against impossible odds. Faith is where happy endings come from.


Faith makes you rely on something that may not be reliable. As we saw in the episode, having faith in that Minotaur got people killed. Having faith in the doctor almost got Amy killed. I prefer to make my own happy endings than allow someone else to make it for me.

Skrtel should never had started against Bale, Kelly or Flanagan would have been better bets as they get forward as well as hold the wing against wide players.

Adam wasn't given any warning before his first booking but should probably be on his last warning coming out for the second half.

Bellamy should have started right with Downing left, they both work in tandem with the full backs and get crosses in, which in turn bring Carroll into the game.

Yeah we're playing shit but all it takes is a bit of thought from Dalglish, rather than pick a team that might play well together in training, pick one that snuffs out the other teams game, we've let Bale and Walker run the show out wide. If we'd played our full backs and wingers in their right positions that wouldn't have happened.

This game can be won still if Kenny drives a bit of urgency into the team, Carragher needs to find a forward pass, we need out wingers playing on the right sides and Lucas can handle the middle on his own, we just need the forwards to pressure Tottenham in their own half.

Characters in stories do things for many other reasons than faith as well. Love, money, power, adventure. I think you are confusing ambition and drive with faith.

A better alternative would be to rely on tidal and solar power and invest in getting those up to the efficiency levels needed to make them economically compatible with fossil fuels.

Also nuclear power is a much better option for long term security than fossil fuels, but due to pig-headed ignorance and the media the public has a disproportionate dislike of nuclear power. 

Encouraging micropower generation, again solar power is probably best, in new builds and for factories and large buildings should help supplement the grid.

Faith is the belief in something you cannot prove. Yes, that means it applies to religion, but faith *is not exclusive to belief in a higher power*.

What you said (and what ClockOut said) is true within this post. But in general the rule on this sub is that until 48 hours after air, comments about a new episode are considered spoilers. If someone sees the bolded comment above and then thinks that applies to everything -- even outside this post -- then we could have trouble.

To recap:

- In this particular thread, spoiler tags for anything but future episodes are unneeded. That is because this post is a discussion post and should be expected to contain spoilers for the episode we're discussing.

- Outside of this particular thread, discussion about new episodes within 48 hours of air time is considered to be a spoiler and should be tagged as such.

Look again

&gt;I cant see your point here, see if it actually isnt causing any problems, then surely I shoudnt worry.

Just because something isn't a problem now doesn't mean now isn't a good time to fix it. In fact it's much better to fix something when it's not causing a problem than later when it's intertwined with other issues.

As a terrible analogy, your logic would be not to start putting up storm defences until a storm is coming.

&gt;I literally see no problem in having religious people in government.

My problem isn't that they are religious it's

* They are unelected and unaccountable

* They are there purely because they are religious

* They do not represent the religious groups of this country https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/File:Bsa-religion-question.svg , let alone the religious groups of the Christians in this country (39% not CofE)

true,C_Caveman,null,null,"&gt;by your logic: so it only had the ability to die when the pressure of needing to eat were relieved?

I don't want to make an argument out of this but this is nothing close to what I said. I didn't say when his ""hunger"" is relieved or anything close to that. Don't confuse when I say 'instinct to survive' with hunger. Yes they are related here but you are going on to much about eating and meals.

These are the lines/scenes that you should focus on if you want to get my point.

The Doctor was able to draw the creature into a room and was able to distract it enough to have an actual conversation with it.

&gt; ""You want this to stop. Because you are just instinct""

But once the kid with the glasses started talking again, the instinct to survive (Don't think of it as hunger, yes you can draw an analogy between the two but if you think of it as instinct you can get my point better) and he became violent beast again.

Then at the end when the Doctor breaks Amy's faith in him, the creature stumbles across the hallway and the Doctor rushes over.

&gt;I severed the food supply. I sacrificed her faith in me, gave you the space to die.

Once the Doctor severed Amy's faith in him. There was no one who the creature could either chase or feed off of since no one else has had their faith broken or changed (ie no one else was saying praise him). 

**THIS IS THE IMPORTANT PART.** 

Once that instinct to survive (not the relieving of hunger) was not the focus or a driving part of the creature it allowed the creature to die. Remember it wants to be stopped because all it is now is ""just instinct"". Because all that is driving this creature to live is just instinct. And once you remove it, all you have is an ancient creature who no longer wants to live. That is why the Doctor gave him ""a space to die"". It is not as it's entire race is like this, it is just that the ONLY reason this one creature had to live was that one instinct. So once you give that creature a small period of time where it doesn't have that one instinct, it will die.

This is the point where I cannot explain it any farther. If you still don't get the exact point I am trying to get across, just don't assume I mean something else. This is not to argue with you, just to fully explain my point. It is fine for us to disagree on a point, I just want to make sure you are aware of what my side is.

I can't speak for the foundation course, but most of the textbooks we were told to buy weren't really that useful. Saying that, there was a maths textbook on the reading list which came in pretty useful, and it was like £15 so it wasn't too expensive. It's massive as well lol, and I still refer to it every so often for certain problems I come across on CS. There's also like a pretty small book just full of constants that you'll probably use in thermodynamics. Whilst we didn't use it too much, it did come in useful when we did, and I'm pretty sure it's less than a tenner too.

Yeah I transferred over at the end of my first year because I really wasn't enjoying it and it was showing in my coursework/exam performance. It wasn't difficult at all to transfer over, and it seems as though that sort of thing happens more than you might think anyway. I'm not saying you won't enjoy it though, I've got quite a few friends I still keep in touch with from AE, a few who graduated this year, and they're liking their time there :) It's definitely not a walk in the park though, they do throw you in at the deep end, but only because it encourages you to learn stuff on your own accord, rather than expecting the lecturers to give you all the info you need.

At the end of the day, if you're going to spend 3+ years of your life learning about a subject, make it about a subject you enjoy (and that you're hopefully good at), rather than one that you can only just keep up with. Whilst I'm sure you won't have a problem with AE, don't feel pressured to stay on the course if you feel it's not what you expected and that there's a better one available for you.

Second, that was not what the episode was saying.  Look at Rita, she was portrayed as an intelligent and capable young person who had religious faith.  The Doctor was going to take her along.

The point was that the Doctor isn't someone to put your undying faith in, like Amy had.  He's a man, who is vain and arrogant and wants to be adored and puts his friends in harms way; he has massive amounts of self loathing.  He's no loving god.  But after he makes a sacrifice of his own happiness on Amy's  behalf, her faith in him is restored and she can still pieces of the hero she adored as a small child.  And I think that this is going to come into play in later episodes.

Basically, I the episode was saying more that blind faith (like what Howie had in conspiracy theories and what Amy had in the Doctor) is dangerous, but true faith (like what Rita had and what Amy's faith becomes at the end) is a positive thing.",0,1316370402,null,0,true,0,c2kskky,t3_kjo2d,t1_c2kskky,t3_kjo2d,1427616082,11,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,11

true,rcglinsk,null,null,"&gt;I honestly don't understand why some people are trying to deny this, and I certainly don't understand why it's getting downvote-bombed.

""Faith"" doesn't mean the same thing to you as it does to the people you're arguing with. 

About 2 centuries ago Reason was proclaimed a Goddess.  Any path to knowledge that is not reason must be maligned as unreason.  Stamping out all thinking that is not reasoning is something of a moral obligation.  

Problems arise with a notion like ""faith in your family.""  For you, this is probably a very simple concept - your family will *always* love and support your family.   For your antagonists, this is hard to comprehend, as it is common sense, but also blasphemous because the *always* part was not arrived at through reason.  

The solution is to split the word faith into two new meanings.  One sense will serve for purely religious connotations.  Faith in god is unreasoned reckoning about a deity.  Faith in family is really just trusting your family to love you.  Luke Skywalker's faith in his friends is just confidence in knowing Han Solo is on his side.  

Now, here's the key concept to understand, why you are getting downvoted.  There are *three* meanings of faith now.  The two new meanings to accommodate Luke Skywalker, and the older meaning, the way you are using it.  The new meanings do not offend the Godess, as they are defined by her rules.  Your meaning offends her, invoking the moral obligation to stamp you out.

true,widgetas,null,null,"Seeing as I took part in a [march yesterday calling for a secular Europe](http://secular-europe-campaign.org/march-rally/), as well as being active on the national and local secular scene, I feel the need to make a few points about Secularism and why it's rather important.

&gt; Is there really any need. I understand that atheists get very het up...

Yes, there *is* a need! Secularism concerns the separation of church and state, it says nothing about whether or not a religion is true. In fact secularism stops the state from effectively saying that *one* is true by endorsing it. While it's true that most secularist *are* atheists, it's not a requirement at all. It so happens that the people who take their religion the most seriously are very unlikely to also be secularists, because it limits the influence their religion can/will have over other people. I know a few Christians who are also secularists.

Personally I have never had a religious faith and as such anyone using a religious argument or motivation to try and dictate the laws under which I live irks me greatly. However secularism is not only about ensuring religion doesn't influence government, but also stops government influencing religion. It protects minority religions in their practice and stops the powers that be regulating how people worship. Take a look at our laws and see exactly what power the CoE has.

&gt; but its certainly not a majority.

That doesn't really matter. It doesn't matter if it's 1million, 1,000, or even 'only' the Bishops themselves. No matter how many or few, it is still the official line of the *state endorsed* religion. The very fact that so few people are openly adding their agreement by actually being actively CoE is a very good indication that the CoE is now very much irrelevant to the majority of the British people and should have its status revoked. Church stats show that only [~1.1 million people are attending CoE churches](http://www.churchofengland.org/media-centre/news/2011/02/provisional-attendance-figures-for-2009-released-attending-a-local-cofe-church-continues-to-be-part-of-a-typical-week-for-11-million-people.aspx) now. You might notice that's *not* just Sundays. That's because Sunday attendance [fell below 1 million several years](http://www.churchsociety.org/issues_new/church/stats/iss_church_stats_attendance.asp) ago. As such they've now switched to counting 'weekly' to make the numbers seem more impressive. The links are the churches *own* research, btw.

&gt; The Church recieves barely any taxpayers money, infact im pretty certain it recieves none whatsoever,

Yes, they do actually. Churches have tax exemption: the tax payers don't even get the choice to give them the money. The CoE has a privileged position in this country (Bishops in the Lords) etc, as well as being the *official* religion. If that means nothing, then it won't matter if we do away with it. The Lords Spiritual have been instrumental in recent years in blocking various Bills that would have helped equality legislation, human rights etc. They don't often vote, but when they do it's not very hard to guess what the topic might be and which way they'll vote.

&gt; But really, its not like the Church of England pushes its doctrines on people.

Many faith schools are funded by the state, in fact one third of schools in the UK are faith based. Children are effectively *taught* which religion to believe. You appear not to care and that's your choice but I can never fathom how some religious people can't make the leap of imagination to consider how they'd feel if a Catholic school was teaching their child when they themselves are Anglican. Or how Catholic parents might feel if their only option was a Muslim school.

Did you know that these schools can bar teachers from getting a job because they are not of any or the right faith? That goes against the European directive. Someone can be discriminated against simply because of their (lack of) religion. Where else is that acceptable? Skin colour, race, age, sex, sexuality... refusal on the grounds of anything else is illegal. In fact when it comes to anything but jobs for a religious group, if you're discriminated against for something like that then it's illegal. 

&gt; Basically, even I as an atheist dont see the point in this

Hi! I'm an atheist and I do. But then I'm also a secular humanist.

&gt; Just people trying to copy America.

I recommend you read up on the subject a bit as it's really not so easily dismissed. A good start is the [National Secular Society's General Principles](http://www.secularism.org.uk/generalprinciples.html). If you don't find it stalkerish, can I ask where in the UK you are? Personally I'm in Bristol where the Bristol Secular Society was set up about 6 months ago. I think there's a need for more local Secularist groups!

To give a small overview of what secularists have been doing recently:

* Challenging the NHS over many Chaplains they have and how much they pay them: Chaplains are provided in hospitals (""Serving all faiths and none"" apparently) but they are not paid for by religious groups. They are paid for by taxpayers. This is not a small issue: They cost the public *millions* of pounds when there is absolutely no reason they shouldn't be provided by the church (if at all). Also the question of fairness comes in as I think the average pay for a chaplain is well above that of a nurse.
* Local Education Authorities are reviewing their policy to provide free transportation for children from religious families to faith schools. If you're a child of religious people then you get your transport funded to a faith school if it's a certain distance away, even if there's another nearer (non faith) school you could attend. To explain why this is discriminatory: a non-religious child living next door to the religious family wouldn't get his/her bus paid for.
* The [NSS is defending the ruling by the British Government](http://www.secularism.org.uk/nss-intervention-aims-to-protect.html) concerning 4 (and other) cases that are being taken the the European Court of Human Rights regarding ""religious discrimination"" cases. You'll have heard of these: The BA cross woman; the registrar who didn't want to 'marry' gays; the Relate Councillor who didn't want to give sexual relationship counselling to gays; the nurse who was sacked because she refused to not wear her cross.
* Trying to bring the Vatican to justice concerning child abuse.

[Those and many more.](http://www.secularism.org.uk/campaigns.html)

I come from a religious family, my dad is a church of England vicar, I have since renounced my belief in a God, but obviously talk to him a lot about his business, about where the church is heading, and what problems it faces.

As far as he is concerned, and bear in mind that he is a very liberal person. Then yes, bishops shouldnt get automatic places in the House of Lords, he does however think that the Archbishop should have a place, as a representative of the church, but also as a representative of those who go to church.

In response to your complaints about C of E churches, I find it hard to see a problem. Not because of the ""forcing of ideas on children"" but because the majority of these schools, are C of E because theyw ere et up BY the church when the government was not required to, and still retain their moniker. I went to a C of E school, but had talks given by muliple religions, and was taught by atheists. The differences between C of E school send Catholic schools seem huge, with C of E schools, essentially being state schools with more focus on religions of all kinds.

As for people not caring about the Church of England, i think youre wrong. I think people dont attend it, but if you actually tried toa ttack it youd find that English people are quite proud of how relaxed and non forecful their state religion is.

I can agree with you on the Bishops in the House of Lords thing. But I simply cant see the comparison you make with C of E schools to Muslim schools. One seems to be forcing a religion, or solely for a religion, and the other is just a name from a bygone era.

&gt; the Archbishop should have a place, as a representative of the church, but also as a representative of those who go to church.

Given that the UK is multi-faith, the problem with that line of thinking is that therefore any/all religions should be represented. There are more practicing Muslims in the UK than there are practicing CoE, for one thing, so we should have an Imam sitting unelected in parliament for the one simple fact that he believes in a specific god 'better' than everyone else?

But I have to say: Religious people get a vote, just like the rest of us. They elect (or not) an MP who puts forth their views (hopefully). So why exactly do they need and get more, and unelected, representation? That's hardly fair. If you're going to take that line then shouldn't the NSS also have someone in there? If not - why not, why the disparity?

CoE schools - Just because some schools don't 'force' the religion, as it were, doesn't mean none of them do nor does it mean they can't in future if they wish. Back in the day, I would say that they *did* do it. It doesn't matter why they set up schools (personally I doubt schools were set up simply due to altruism - they would have served as a very simply way of giving children the 'message' every day!). But yes, you're right - other faith schools do far more forcing of religion. But they're state funded too, so we have the same/similar issue (faith schools being funded even if there's no state religion, I think).

&gt; As for people not caring about the Church of England, i think youre wrong. I think people dont attend it, but if you actually tried toa ttack it youd find that English people are quite proud of how relaxed and non forecful their state religion is.

I know where you're coming from, but it not the same as their being religious. If enough pressure was mounted on the government (which I hope to see) then there's no reason why it shouldn't be debated. As we've seen with other issues in the past, just because the public 'feel' they like it doesn't mean it should or will be kept: A decent argument is needed not 'grumbling'. But if the move to remove the CoE did go to parliament, you can bet any sum of money that all the religions will band together to combat the 'evils' of secularism. Religions only ever support each other when the secularists come along.

&gt; One seems to be forcing a religion, or solely for a religion, and the other is just a name from a bygone era.

Some do, dome don't. But it's not just up to the schools: At the moment schools are legally required to provide ""collective worship of a mainly Christian nature"" once (or more?) a week, though parents can choose to remove their children. That is not a fair, relevant or good law.

&gt; thank you for giving me these links to have a look at.

Any time. Feel free to ask about anything else you might want to know. But don't get me started on how the word ""Secularism"" has been and is continually skewed by some religious people...!

true,TheCheesePirate,null,null,"I am really growing queasy about King Kenny. In his first stint as manager, training a bunch of Brits to play a pass and move 4-4-2 when the rest of the league was playing a slightly more physical, slightly more longbally 4-4-2 was tactically fantastic.

In his second stint as manager, he's trying to train a bunch of Brits to play a pass and move 4-4-2 while not realizing that the rest of the league has evolved. His opposition is no longer mainly Englishmen, it is no longer a constant 4-4-2, and it is no longer so concentrated on physicality and the longball – the second and third points being a direct result of the first. Take a look at Spurs, they started just 3 Englishmen and had a hell of a lot more possession and chances, even before we lost men.

He is trying to teach a bunch of Brits how to play a game the rest of the world already knows, while forcing out Meireles and Aquilani, freezing out Maxi, and benching Kuyt, players who would have fit the scheme.

I hope I am wrong, but Kenny seems to me to be a nationality-biased tactical dinosaur. It didn't show last year when he played the interesting 5-3-2, but keep in mind that his expensive English striker was hurt, so he had to play a Dutchman. He had no choice but to replace our injured English center mid with a Portuguese one. His only option at winger last year was an Argentine. I'll admit that he replaced an injured Brazilian fullback with an Englishman, but I don't think fullbacks are quite as influential when it comes to play style.

The question of ""efficiency"" depends on what the Doctor is trying to achieve - which is, almost always, a peaceful solution (where everybody lives).  If that fails then there's always plenty more forceful options at hand; the dilemma for him is how to escalate the situation while staying within his moral framework.

true,Ruwn,null,null,"&gt;I have been a Chelsea fan for years. I'm relatively young, in college, 

You've described me, but I bleed blue through and through.

I agree in the sense that maybe Lampard no longer should start every single match, but I disagree that he should never start. I think it depends a lot upon the makeup of the squad and the team we're playing. I won't list out every combination, but Lampard very much has a role to play in the current Chelsea squad.

In my opinion, he should become an anchor instead of the spear, a la Scholes. He needs to understand that he doesn't have to score so many goals per season - we have new players to do that. He doesn't have the stamina or the speed maybe, but the technique is still there. He can offer a calming presence in the midfield and set up plays from further back. 

With respect to Ramires: yes, he made a bullshit mistake and should have let Sturridge take that shot IMO, but his work ethic is insane. He made a great run back covering for Terry if you remember, and he caused a lot of problems for United's center/right. He's still a bit rough to be sure, but once he gets proper passing drilled into him, he'll be spectacular.

true,widgetas,null,null,"&gt; Do you strongly feel that it's necessary to also make them pay tax?

On this subject I will admit I haven't given it a great deal of thought. I think up until I've just pointed out that they are tax exempt, rather than come down one side or the other But I shall do so now. To answer your question: Yes, I think so. Churches might perform a good deal of charitable work, but they are not specifically or primarily charities. They exist to perpetuate their religion, morals, dogma etc (generally). When they do give out food to the homeless etc, very *very* often there is some sort of 'payment'. Consider the Salvation Army preaching to homeless they give food to, or their refusal to accept/allow homosexuality.

I'm fairly sure we have laws in the UK that bar discrimination which apply to charities (and everyone, really, apart from religion) and as such it is not in the interest of religious groups to become charities. They hide behind their 'faith' status in order to discriminate against certain groups in society.

While I can understand that the idea of taxing the CoE will cause unease among many people, you have to remember that they weren't always as poor as they now are. Consider for a minute the buildings that are now crumbling, the art and stained glass windows, the precious metals contained within. Where did the money come to pay for all that? Now I don't bring this up to say ""They were rich, now we should get our money back"" but rather ""They were rich, they're just not at the moment or anymore. That isn't our fault.""

Not many other 'interest' groups are tax free. I can't think of any at the moment. Large sporting associations aren't tax free and I will say without even looking at the numbers that more people follow sport more than once a week than attend any and all religious ceremonies that take place. Some might argue that religion is a way of life or a required part of someone's life - But so is sport. I don't follow sport religiously (apols) but many hundreds of thousands of people do. So why does religion have a special status?

Even if the majority of people in the country do believe in a god, they're not following the gods specifically designated by the established churches. Most people are 'spiritual' (whatever that means) and the church likes to pretend they're their own but I don't really think they are.

While I agree that churches in America rake in many magnitudes more money than UK organisations, that doesn't mean that churches around here don't turn a profit or should pay their way like any other organisation. If they don't want to pay tax, then they don't have to: They can file for charitable status. But then of course they have to follow the law with regards discrimination etc. I doubt very much that anyone can defend such a position - ""They shouldn't be made to become a charity because otherwise they won't be allowed to discriminate against X, Y or Z.""

Why do they seem fine to you - why do you think they're like charities or non-profit organisations? I know it's cliche, but look at the wealth of the Catholic Church. While we're at it, we should remember Mark 19:21

*""Jesus said unto him, If thou wilt be perfect, go and sell that thou hast, and give to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven: and come and follow me.""*

We started with the first Doctor in 1963, he went for 3 years, then the second and third Doctors which went for about that much time, then the fourth Doctor who had the longest run of 7 years, etc. The classic series from 1963-1989 had the first seven Doctors. The eighth Doctor's only on screen appearance was in the 1996 Doctor Who movie, The Enemy Within. Though McGann (the 8th) has done tons of radio dramas over the decades DW was off air. Then the 2005 reboot shows us Doctors 9-11.

Mind you back in the sixties there was this movie based off of DW called Dr. Who and the Daleks about a human named Dr. Who who invents a time machine and takes along Susan Who and Barbara Who, and Ian to Skaro by accident. Also in 2003 was the animated story Scream of the Shalka which was supposed to be canon for the ninth Doctor (Richard E. Grant) but by the time they finished the story it was announced that the show was coming back in 2005.

That's the general gist of Doctors in existence, including the non-canonical. There are lots of other noncanonical Doctors too, but I'm too lazy to type it all. /:0

If Essien was fit this game would probably have been Chelsea's. They need someone to fit in that defensive position. Mikel simply does not have the athleticism to cover the ground needed and disrupt the play. After 5 minutes on the pitch today that was really obvious.

I think Mata actually played better in the trio in the second half than Lampard did. It could be the future position for him. Lamps was only subbed as they were so far behind and needed some more dynamism and to take more risks. Calculated gamble that payed off.

I agree though, no one deserves to be in the team on legacy. I've always had doubts about Lamps but he fit Mourinho's system so well that those doubts disappeared. I honestly don't see him in a Chelsea top next season, he doesn't fit the style AVB wants with that movement and attacking flair. The problem is that no one currently is better than him. We have no strong defensive midfielder, which we need to free up Meireles for a more attacking role, so we're kinda stuck with him for a bit.

Ramires was one of our best midfielders, easily though.

I definitely agree with you on a Jamie/Doctor. It's one of the chief reasons I don't like Rose, and Martha, she's okay. You've also got a point there about the human centric stuff. Especially with Moffat we've probably not seen the surface of a real alien planet. Or at least chiefly dealt with one particular alien culture.

Oh and Amy did the whole love the Doctor thing too. Except it's more like he's her fairytale knight in shining armor who she doesn't fall in love with. Either way, her unwavering awe of him was annoying, so I'm glad about last night's episode.

The Face of Evil is one of my favorite classics, you're right it's got an awesome plot. War Games check, Deadly Assassin check, Ark pretty good, Pyramids check, and definitely Inferno - though that could've easily been a 4 part story.

I think that 45-50 minutes can be a good thing and a bad thing. On one hand we don't get the sort of character depth as before- or it's at least harder to do it well, but on the other hand we don't suffer through stories whose number of episodes could be cut in half. Moffat has been putting in more and more two-parters, so that should make you happy.

The sonic screwdriver? Agreed. Somewhat. The first two Doctors always spent half of a 6 part story trying to convince people who's on whose side, so some psychic paper is definitely welcome. The screwdriver? Well that's pretty much what K-9 was. He baled out the Doctor on numerous occasions.

I think that the sonic screwdriver has been used to solve what would've been major obstacles for the Doctor in classic, but those obstacles have been replaced with others.

true,LokianEule,mccoy,Time's Champion,"Interesting thoughts. I'm not sure that Moffat has made the stories more fantasy versus sci-fi. His stories are full of time travel, space ships, aliens, ray guns and all that. It's probably the tone. The tone of these past two series has been very *fairy tale*. The way the Doctor talks about Amy and Rory as the Girl/Boy Who Waited, the Roman Centurion, etc.

Character has never really been Moffat's strong point, but I can forgive him that because I like his stories. I rely on the stand alones and non-Moffat episodes to give me the character moments.

Though I really don't know what you mean about neutering the Doctor. There's been a lot of sexual innuendos and Doctor-kissing. As for the Doctor emotionally, I think that he is definitely more distant. More alien, which was Moffat was going for. How do you think Moffat holds back Smith?

What's most interesting though, is that you really loved The God Complex. Someone else I talked to said that they absolutely abhorred it. It's kind of amazing. But I guess the fact that you love Davies explains it. As for me, I thought it was pretty good. I felt the ending was a little rushed and that the whole episode was designed to set up for the following ones, versus being it's own story, but it was good nevertheless.

Now how sci-fi you think that is, is definitely interesting. How does an alien feed off of *faith* exactly? What do you think have been some of the *least* sci-fi episodes of Moffat era?",0,1316395522,null,0,false,0,c2kvg5j,t3_kj3k5,t1_c2kvg5j,t1_c2kvcu0,1427617439,1,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,1

Do a deconstruction plot in the comics, the audios, the novels. Don't do it on the TV show, please. Let us avoid it if we like.

And I mean... RTD's last season had two episodes pointing out how much the Doctor sucks, Midnight and Journey's End. This season already has three (AGMGTW, TGWW, and TGC) and it isn't even over.

In fact the one thing I've always credited Moffat with was his clever approach to the possibilities of time travel. (Of course, time travel is not the exclusive property of science fiction. Remember, Merlin traveled in time.) Beyond that, true that there have been space ships, aliens and ray guns, but he he's always loathe to provide scientific explanations, or ""technobabble"" as he so dismissively calls it, preferring to toss off lines like ""timey-wimey wibbly-wobbly"", which I liked the first time I heard it but has since gotten tiresome. The attitude seems to be ""It's possible because I say it's possible, don't worry about explanations"", which is much more in keeping with magic and fantasy than it is with sci-fi. For me, half the fun of sci-fi has always been the pseudo-scientific explanations behind it's wonders, which Davies was always great at. And yes, the tone has been very fairy tale-ish, not just with all the ""girl/boy who waited"" nonsense (which, again, I liked at first but has since gotten tiresome--this is because Moffat and the concept of subtlety are completely estranged) but with lines like (and I'm paraphrasing here) ""I hate good wizards in stories. They always turn out to be him"".

When I say he's neutered the Doctor, I don't mean sexually (although, for all the flirting that has been directed towards the Doctor, and all the times he's been kissed, he himself has very rarely expressed anything remotely resembling lust or romantic interest). What I mean is that his flashes of anger are far fewer and farther between than they used to be. Even his hyper-intellectual intensity has been tamped down in favor of a personality that is mostly goofy. And yes, I agree that the Doctor ought to be goofy. I'm saying the balance has tipped too far in the direction of goofy, whereas Eccleston and Tennant, under Davies, has the balance right. As far as how Moffat holds Smith back, I think an actor will always be best when he has character heavy scripts to work with, and emotionally honest dialogue. Like you said, character has never been Moffat's strong point, and he prefers to manipulate his audience into ""feeling"" by means of tricks like slow motion, dramatic music and frequent deaths or ""deaths"".

Which is *exactly* what Terry Nation did with the first three Dalek stories.  He realized that the rules he had set up initially were too limiting (among other things, he killed them off in the first serial!) so he made changes in order to better suit the story he wanted to tell. 

There's no point in religiously adhering to the rules if they prevent the telling of a good story. Russell T. Davies did the same thing when he contradicted a major part of *Voyage of the Damned* in *Turn Left*, because doing otherwise would ruin the premise of the new episode. The same goes for Donna's 'mind explody powers' in the *End of Time* that made most of the Doctor's moaning about her unavoidable death 'if she remembers for just one second' rather redundant.

When you're writing for a series like Doctor Who, inconstancies in your own writing are almost unavoidable, especially if you're tasked with writing 5+ episodes per year. So unless you're a continuity-nut like Ian Levine, it's best just to accept that these things happen and get on with writing the story you want to tell.",0,1316400387,null,0,false,0,c2kw15l,t3_kjy4n,t1_c2kw15l,t1_c2kvuvl,1427617713,7,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,7

I just wish he would stop calling the daleks the deerdicks, though.

While not perfect in pacing and structure (specifically the placement of Night Terrors and The Girl Who Waited), this is one of the better arc-based ""mainstream"" television seasons. The clues are there, the development is there, and the themes are excellent.

But when you create an arc in an existing series that is designed to completely destroy everything the character has stood for to many of the fans, no matter how well-done it is, it is going to be badly received by most of that segment of the fandom. To completely aim past your target demographic like that is either sheer brilliance or stupidity. Given that Doctor Who is the Fall Yams to the BBC's Harvest Moon DS, I would argue it's stupidity.

This would be a great arc for the novels, the audios, or the comics. Honestly, if even one scene had been shot in a different manner in TGWW, I would be able to accept this as being a ""more gentle"" deconstruction than RTD's seasons 2-4. 

But Matt Smith and his brilliant acting, his devotion to the craft, his perfect face as he made eye contact with Old Amy, ruined this season and possibly all of Doctor Who for me. Because that moment changed it from ""maybe the Doctor is still figuring out what's right and wrong"" to ""the doctor knows right from wrong and just can't stop himself."" I just can't bear to see the worst trait in myself in my heroes. 

tl;dr GREAT writing aimed at a demographic intrinsically hostile to the themes of said writing, which I could be fixed by rearranging some episodes and giving one actor slightly different instructions for one scene in one episode.

On the other hand, Players like Kalou, Sturridge, Anelka were able to fit in a wide position.

I've never watched the Belgian league but have read (and youtube) that Lukaku plays a lot like Drogba. So I'm not surprised at all that he didn't look comfortable playing wide today.

So they thought they didn't need to feed on the people there, especially since they were feeding off of the ship's engines as well. Remember when Amy was counting down? The angels say they're making her do it to see her fear for her life, and scare her.

At the end, however, it's revealed by Doctor that they can't actually feed off of the crack, and instead Doctor sends them into the crack to erase them from time. 

TL;DR the angels in TOA/FAS were extremely arrogant, and wanted to play with the victims, since they thought they were heading towards an infinite food supply.

And, as a sidenote about God Complex, in order for an image of an angel to become an angel, it needs to be powered by an actual angel. Remember the angel in Amy's mind? The second the angel that put the image into her mind vanished from time and space, the image in her head no longer affected her. It became powerless with no angel to power it.

They aren't based on an actual image put into his head by an angel.

As for the book, it depends on who wrote it. We really don't know. It could have been someone with an angel in their head(Which, possibly, is how he got so much information on the angels to begin with), or it could have been pure paranoia.

I think the sense of arrogance, swagger, or confidence, dependent upon how you view the Eleventh as an individual viewer, is actually a major driving factor in his entire portrayal of the Doctor.

Deconstruction is one of my favorite literary concepts, and I have mixed feelings about seeing it on Who. On one hand... I am new enough to the fandom that I should love it like I loved the Watchmen. But I had exposure at a young enough age, to such an idealistic version of the Doctor, that this is very hard for me. I'm learning a lot about why some of my friends hate deconstruction so much, about when and how it should be used, and about how important the framing is. 

I just wish it could have been for an alternate continuity, like the Star Trek movie.

Pay isn't great to start with, expect around £17k during training and first year or two but ample opportunity to move up the grades and earn more.  Training is relatively simple, work is interesting in a hospital (the job in community pharmacy is more menial in my experience) and the hours/conditions are good.  I decided I wanted to go travelling in New Zealand 18 months ago, came here and managed to land a job in a community pharmacy - simply put there's always work for technicians, it's never going to be the highest paid work but it's always there.

I've got a biology degree behind me but it wasn't necessary to me getting the position in the NHS initially but I'm sure it helped.  It's entirely possible to go into it straight from school, just as long as you're willing to learn a bit about pharmacy/pharmacology, basic physiology etc... it's all quite easy to absorb through the on the job training and if you have even the slightest interest in the subject you shouldn't have a problem.  

Something to think about, there's plenty of other similarly accessible professions in the NHS that can set you up pretty well in life.

And for the first time, I thought Amy's relationship with the Doctor was eloquently explained. She's not his companion because she's clever, she's his companion because she's devoted to him. It makes even a shallow character like Amy Pond seem epic.
Good job Toby Whithouse! He also wrote a great line for Rory in the Vampires of Venice episode where Rory nails  it:

This is how I understood it, kind of like imakitty explained it. Pretend to be gods, subjects become secular, imprison them in a space station that pick up random people that have a belief in something to hope for, which the minotaur then instinctually turns into belief in him, so that he instinctually goes and sucks out people's life energy. He doesn't want to, as is evidenced by the Doctor's conversation with the minotaur, but, as is evidenced by the minotaur's storming out of the room, he can't stop himself. To be honest, this could have been explained a bit better, mostly in the scene where the Doctor has caught the minotaur. I found him difficult to understand.

I'm also thinking that what the Doctor saw in his room was either A: Melody Pond (and something related to not being able to find her) or B: Rory and Amy dying. I'm also deeply disturbed by this because I'm not 100% sure that we have yet to reach the Doctor's ""darkest hour"". And if it was Rory and Amy's death I would throw a brick through my TV in anguish.

Once again, not saying that she can't be brought back.  The writers can obviously bring her back as a talking pogo stick if that's what they wish.

true,MercurySchultz,mcgann,McGann,"Dude, this whole new series has switched off between deconstruction and reconstruction.

Eccelston's session was all about asking the questions Old who didn't. What would happen after a companion came back? Why did we never examine the ramifications that would have on their home life? How the hell did England stay ignorant of aliens for so long? How could one man endure centuries of death and trauma for so long?

Then we got Tennant and we immediately switched to reconstruction for his series with Rose. We sorted out all the issues from before, and we needed to be reminded why this man was so wonderful and why the travel was worth it.

Then we switched back when Martha came along and got a look at two major unanswered questions: How does the Doctor cope with all these successive losses and how much harm does he do opposed to good? The truth? He doesn't and it varies.

Donna's season was bait and switch. We got the fun reconstruction parts that were straightforward Classic Who in the 21st Century. Then we looked at the big questions again: What happens when the Doctor doesn't save the day? What becomes of those he leaves behind? How important is the companion role in the Doctor's life?

Davies examined roles and ideas of the plot and mythos of Who. Moffat looks into the characters himself. Matt's Doctor is a deliberate reaction to Tennant's. He lacks Tennant's qualms about wiping out an enemy to save humanity, he knows he isn't a monster for making the hard choices. He is also a reaction romantically: he knows how much he damaged Martha and Sarah Jane by making them pine away and he helps Amy connect with her husband instead of going down that route.

Amy and Rory are the explored notions of the polar opposites in companions. Amy is the closest thing the show will get to a real life Whovian. She fell for the Doctor as a child got a lot of crap for believing in him (Classic Who fans: does this ring any bells for you?). Then the Doctor came back as awesome as ever and she was rewarded for her wait. Her issue is that she will not grow up because of it, and the God Complex backs this up now more than ever. The idea? Yes, it is fun to love the show, but you've got a life to live too.

Rory is the everyman exemplified. He is what happens when you take an absolutely normal unassuming bloke and take him through time and space. He's going to be petrified and snarky (like many first time non fans) but he will grow to love it and it will make him a better person.

true,[deleted],null,null,"The thing is, even though that particular moment was what really tipped my opinion, the practice harsh self-deconstruction is still generally harmful to optimistic franchises. Look at what Shadow the Hedgehog did to the Sonic the hedgehog franchise. Imagine what would have happened if Alan Moore had used existing characters for the Watchmen. Imagine what would happen if Evangelion had been Gundam or Macross instead, with the same story.

A brutal self-deconstruction in media should be vague about how brutal it is until the last second and effective a reconstruction in the same finale if it wants to keep its existing audience. If you make the Doctor a bad person, the people who watch him because he's a hero will go away. Period. Turning any viewers away is a bad thing with the Beeb in money trouble. 

My personal feelings toward the way the season is going are mine, but they're not unique at all. I am not the only fan who is disinterested in an amoral or immoral Doctor. Anyone who didn't like the seventh Doctor is going to be out soon, and those of us who can't stand to watch our heroes deconstructed in this manner will follow.

I feel the Beeb and the Moff have made a tactical mistake. I respect the work, and it is a good work, but the show is a turtle and the tide is receding. It's not completely screwed without the fans it's alienating, but... we could be a problem if something doesn't change soon.

I say should because even if everyone doesn't feel the way I do, enough of us do that it could damage the show's popularity if things are not reconstructed soon.

true,[deleted],null,null,"This is a very apt analysis of deconstruction and reconstruction in Doctor Who and I think you should develop and publish it.

Here's my issue, though:

I love deconstruction. But when a piece deconstructs itself, you have to be careful.

Imagine you're working on the flooring and basement ceiling of a house. Are you also walking on the floor at that time? ...No, probably not. If it's got enough holes in it, and you take apart enough of what's underneath your feet, you are going to fall through.

I love that New Who is willing to take a critical look at Old Who. But there's one assumption that is sort of like the central dogma of Who, that cannot be thoroughly exposed and wraped without destroying the show. That idea is, ""The Doctor means well, and is a force of good."" 

Now, you can expose and play with that idea, but you must never, ever completely dismantle it. It's the foundation, and without it, the House of Who is toast.

Having the Doctor play into evil hands? Fine. Having the doctor be temporarily confused about right and wrong? Fine. Having the doctor make a bad choice that turns out to be all for the best? Fine.

But the moment the Doctor does something irreversibly bad for selfish reasons only, and can be ok with himself, you have destroyed the show. We came very, very close to that in TGWW, if the fan hypothesis is to believed. We got to that point in The Waters of Mars, but it was treated as a low point for the character, a temporary lapse from which he has recovered. Or has he? AGMGTW fairly turned this into an ongoing struggle, which is a move I can like.

But the moment any fan realizes ""The Doctor's not good after all!"" is the moment they might run away screaming. They might not stick around for the revelation that maybe there is good there, maybe this is a temporary lapse that makes his goodness all the more impressive for how hard he has to fight the dark.

There are a handful of reasons I stuck around past that moment in TGWW:

1. I understand how deconstruction tends to play out in a franchise and know that he will swing back to good soon, which he did in TGC, though not enough to appease me.
2. My best friend needs someone to watch with.
3. I love this subreddit.
4. I have little else to live for right now. Yes, sad story, you guys don't care, but it's a reason I stick around, so it's worth mentioning.
5. The season is more gone than ahead, why not finish?

Most fans can't count that many reasons when their thing gets deconstructed. If their attachment is intellectual, they're all like, ""Oh cool."" If it's some kind of emotional or psychological thing it's like ""WAAAAAH HE'S NOT A NICE GUY AFTER ALL."" 

I have been on both sides of the deconstruction. I've been one of the new fans who thinks it's ""cool"" and ""clever"" and insightful, appreciating the old work better (Batman). I've been one of the old fans who's been shocked and hurt that a hero so important to them has been disgraced and corrupted (DW, Sonic). I've even been the old fan who saw the new deconstruction and decided it really made the old work better (Power Rangers).

The PR example is noteworthy in that when it deconstructed the ""teenagers with attitude"" concept, it created a second team of rangers to do so, leaving one ""straight"" team and one ""deconstructed"" team. It gave me Bridge and Jack to believe in while I reveled in watching Charlie be a psycho, allowing me to both preserve my original feelings and look at everything in a new light. It was very clever.

If DW would do something similar and preserve the goodness in the Doctor while showcasing the evil, I could live with it. I'm just afraid that won't happen, or this uncomfortable kind of deconstruction will linger too long on a point already well made. 

tldr uh...  complex deconstruction metaphor I made up to teach my students... application of the idea to DW... concerns about how most fans don't have as many reasons to watch as I do... examples of self-deconstructions done right and wrong from other media in terms of how I reacted to them relative to my newness to said fandom.

I have no problems with the quality of Moff's writing and while I dislike River Song, I cannot complain about how she is being used.

My problems with DW are precisely because Moff's writing is brilliant. He's making choices that get right to the heart of Doctor Who, but in a way that potentially destroys the Doctor's value as a heroic inspiration. 

It's like when Optimus Prime screamed about wanting someone's face in Revenge of the Fallen. In context, it made a lot of sense. But something about that line shook a lot of old school fans. The Doctor's behavior and the weird pacing of the season--something that the Moff could not help--is really getting to some of us.

Yes, the show can go too far and a balance would be nice. The same could be said of Classic Who; it was a show that got carried away with its  premise and became very difficult to relate to as a whole. So long as we have episodes of frolicking through time and space  relishing every moment, there will be a need for deeper probing questions of the Doctor, his life, and his m.o. The doctor is, at heart, always a good guy but the premise of the show (Since the first doctor) was that he was an anti-heroic trickster. He always rooted for the underdog and the oppressed, but wasn't above using tricky or devious methods to save the day. He will always be the hero, Smith's Doctor can't even resist a lonely crying girl as a call to action. If Moffat knows best, he will always fall back to this. 

I love the episodes that can be ridiculous. Some of my favorites are Vampires of Venice and Unicorn and the Wasp. These took very silly ideas and ran with them, showing that crazy stuff happens all over time and space and it's easier to go with it. But my personal classics are the ones that aren't rose tinted (but I love Billie Piper *cue rim shot*) and show how dangerous having this one cosmically gifted ancient man can be, like Turn Left and The Waters of Mars.

For this membership, we have access to a free trade area which covers the whole EU.  We do the large majority of our trading with other members of the EU, so restricting this free trade (by, say, leaving the EU) would cost a lot of money for not just businesses and people in this country (through higher costs to trade in Europe), but for the government too (who would take in less tax).  Sure, they'd be 'saving' £14bn a year, but they'd probably lose quite a lot through lost tax revenue.  It could mean higher taxes for quite a few people.

Another issue is the fact that being a member of the EU means that anyone from any EU country can live and work in another without hassle.  This is generally a good thing.  Lots of Brits have second homes in countries like Spain and France, and removing ourselves from the EU would make having those homes more expensive / more difficult to acquire in the first place.

The problem with your idea, is that unfortunately - it's enforced slavery. It also means that every person who is unemployed has little or no skills. So, someone who has years experience in a specific field but has found him/her self unemployed for a few months, should go and do data entry? It's ridiculous - they simply would not sign on. (Some people would probably view that as a benefit) but it does mean that people who have paid in for years to the social security net (because that's what it should be, a net, not a hammock) will get nothing out of it.

Our real problem is that certain people view it as a lifestyle, meaning those who work feel like they are being taken for chumps. It's difficult and a solution is not easy. I like the fact that those who are long term unemployed (6 months or more) should only be allowed to turn down a certain number of jobs before being forced to take something (i.e. benefit cut) but then it goes back to my first argument - i.e. are we enforcing slavery.

Perhaps those who have been unemployed for over a year should be forced to do work experience, to at least brush up skills, especially IT.

Even Season 4, pre-specials, had a decent balance. I'm way more likely to count episodes that paint the Doctor in a bad light than serious and non-serious, but I felt there was a good blend. Nothing truly goofy, humor in the dark episodes, and mostly optimism, except the end.

My favorite episodes if it says anything, are ""Midnight,"" ""Boom Town,"" and ""A Christmas Carol."" Midnight was a very dark look at the Doctor, but it was a very sympathetic one; his motives were never in question. Boom Town was hilarious, but it also dealt in a very dark manner with the ethics of killing. While the Christmas Carol was silly, under all the romping there was the very dark edge that the girl was going to die, and the Doctor had no idea while he's doing. I can deal with a bumbling ineffectual Doctor.

I think a good blend is essential, but there should be very few truly lighthearted episodes; they should always have a little bit of a sting to them. That said, the darkest of episodes should always have one of the most optimistic or bright endings.

So, thousands of years pass and they keep perfecting this new ability and thanks to it their species thrive, so when the Doctor meets them again, not only do they have this ""image"" ability, but there's also a jabillion of them. Cor!

true,Sell200AprilAt142,english,"England (Liverpool, City of London, Bournemouth)","&gt; I think the best way to do this would be to invest (**it would be a lot of money initially**) in some government working buildings. These buildings would **provide jobs that require little skill**, and create things that could turn **some kind of profit**, or at least go towards running the building. It could be admin (ie, data entry) or manufacture.


Unfortunately the highlighted bits sum up succinctly why this doesn't work, at least from an economic point of view.  Low skill jobs are dominated by parts of the world where living costs are just not as high as in the UK.  In order to sell the most basic data entry services / minimum quality manufacturing products at the market rate and still pay the workers a minimum wage would require a huge government subsidy.  i.e. the net worth of products would hardly make a dent on the income support costs + cost of running the enterprise.  Not to mention the political difficulties of resurrecting something that sounds similar to the ""poorhouse"" [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Work_house](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Work_house), or organising such a national scheme efficiently from a central place, or the knock on effects of forcing people into unprofitable jobs (do we also, for example, pay for their childcare costs for single parents while they're already making a net loss?)  

Also, what's the incentive for those performing well in the ""non-job"" (in that it doesn't really make a profit) and earning the upper 150% of benefits, to ever move to an actual job in a real business where they might only be making 10% over the normal benefits?  (easy access minimum wage jobs make barely anything over what benefits already provide).   Rather than being an incentive to improve and move on, it would be a reason to try and stay in an ""easy"" job as long as possible and earn more than elsewhere)


I think you have a great motivation to want to see people valuing work and maintaining a habit of going out to work everyday while they build skills.  (And arguably, to gather people like that daily might make training courses and schemes easier to administer to a degree) But I think a more feasible alternative might be to subsidise new jobs in businesses directly (e.g. appreticeships).  That way unskilled, unemployed workers are brought into a potentially profitable ""real"" job from the start, run by people who have an interest in seeing it done well (the owners).  They may still technically be a net loss after the government subsidy, but it would be less expensive for the rest of use whilst giving the chance to build real skills.  The subsidy could be tapered off as the worker's skill improved, and they could see a modest managed rise in income.  Not that this idea isn't fraught with problems either : just how much _is_ a job worth anyway?  (Because this determines the subsidy, and government depts. can't keep up with the speed the market moves etc)

The myth is that unemployment exists because of people's choices or fecklessness. The VAST MAJORITY of unemployed people ""genuinely cannot get a job"". That was precisely my point. It's a basic tenet of economics that unemployment has an inverse relationship to inflation. For many decades the government has explicitly managed the economy such that full unemployment is avoided and consequently inflation is kept low. It's viewed as the correct balance for a healthy national economy. 

The upshot of that policy is, of course, that there will always be less jobs than jobseekers. Therefore, unemployment itself is not something that can be solved.

I just think the safety net should be the guarantee of a job that meets a living wage for the time being, until that person finds something else they would rather be doing.

It is different to slavery, because it would not be compulsory, it would simply be an employment option.

&gt; Perhaps those who have been unemployed for over a year should be forced to do work experience, to at least brush up skills, especially IT.

You need to look wider than unemployment benefits as housing, free travel and a whole load of other stuff makes up the package that some people are on. They aren't avoiding work to get £60 a week, it is because they also get a whole load of other amounts.

Also you might want to think about the cases where we are paying people who simply won't work or are unemployable no matter what you do to them.

No it isn't - that's an absurd conclusion.  
  
All this sort of scheme does is replace benefits with a guaranteed low-income, low-level job.  Instead of signing up to some sort of credit or allowance, you do something really easy and really unimportant in return for a basic wage, if you choose to do so.  
  
Now, if a government were going to implement something like this, it would have to make sure that the program bent over backwards to try and get people into other jobs if they wanted to.  The payment should be applied to skills training as well, and the scheme could include interview training, and give you time off for interviews.  
  
The important thing in a scheme like this is that is should be seen as an investment in people.  If you just want to take the crappy job for the crappy wage, then that's your choice.  You get some money and the government gets some menial work done.  But if you want to improve yourself then the scheme should encourage that, but paying you the same wage while you're improving yourself and improving your chances of getting back into the real world.   
  
  
&gt;So, someone who has years experience in a specific field but has found him/her self unemployed for a few months, should go and do data entry? It's ridiculous  
  
Why is that any more ridiculous than paying them for doing nothing?  In addition, it would look far better on a CV to say that you worked for 6 months rather than sat back and just collected benefits.

true,liverman,lfc68,null,"Wrong. We played worse than Arsenal against Man Utd. 'Why so harsh?' you would ask. Well here's why:

* 
Arsenal managed to score goals against Man Utd. We didn't even go anywhere near more than 1 shot on target.

* We looked like a goddamn non-league side out there. Everyone was off the pace, two red cards for retarded tackles that were pretty damned naive for supposed 'top 4 contenders'.

* It was almost as if tottenham just released the accelerating pedal after the 70th minute, so we were pretty much spared more humiliation other than the last minute goal.

* Stop comparing with Everton or Arsenal to make ourselves feel better. Liverpool played like shit and that's that. 

After all that, I really really hope that we manage to bounce back really well against Wolves and Brighton. Usually when Liverpool lose, at worst we share the same number of shots and possession, or dominate the game completely but leave the game frustrated as hell because we can't convert.

Last night was the worst performance I've seen in quite a while. ):

But the very fabric of our society is built on poverty, both at home and throughout the world. That's a fundamental part of capitalism, isn't it? One man's capital is created from a thousand mens' poverty.

The wider the gap gets between the wealth-owners and the wealth-creators, the less incentive there is to play the game at all. People have to have hope that they can aspire to better things, as well as skills training. If ""better things"" just means a newer sofa and TV on easy payments in exchange for mind-destroying machine tending in a factory, well is it any wonder that some people opt out? The problem to my mind runs deeper than considerations of money. People feel powerless, and wage-slavery seems pointless when even a lifetime's hard work achieves nothing lasting, no comfort in old-age, nothing to pass on to the next generation, not even a chance in hell of buying a home...

true,Sell200AprilAt142,english,"England (Liverpool, City of London, Bournemouth)","&gt; If the cost of making the things in the country were essentially nothing (since it is people working that would otherwise still get the money)

But it won't ever costs ""nothing"", that's the problem.  

People are currently receiving X pounds each out of a government budget that we're for the sake of argument keeping fixed... and under a workhouse plan, in order for people to still receive X, the government needs to  

1. buy / rent the workhouse land
2. build the places if necessary
3. have skilled staff capable of running the place / scheme administrators / supervising staff
4. buy raw materials
5. have whatever professional level quality assurance is necessary (if we're talking manufacturing)
6. machine tooling
7. machine maintenance
8. utilities (electricity costs for factories are huge)
9. and the rest

and
10. offset all these costs with revenue from a basic service / product with the same price as determined by india, china or east europe (which will be tiiiny).


Which is why the big question is ""what on earth should points 1-9 be in order to minimise the loss to something not catastrophic"".  Sure, if someone finds a way to make £10 worth of product per hour using free materials, no skills, no senior staff, within a walk of an area of large unemployment, then they'll be in the money and they're probably doing it already without the government's help.  (This incidentally, is the tragic economics of prostitution.  It's also (unrelated to prostitution) why the current government changed regulations so people in council houses could run their own business from the premises, but I don't know how well that worked).  But it's actually very hard to do, not without potentially trebling what the government spends on the unemployed in exchange for giving them a ""work ethic"" (which is commendable and important, but in itself very hard to put a price on, and even harder to sell to the majority of tax paying voters who will demand proof it even works)

It's also hard to find a product / service for the government to produce without effectively undercutting an actual British business which is doing the same.  Imagine how you'd feel just scrapping by running a (very) basic pottery business, and the government opens a whole factory to churn them out keeping the price the same as yours with tax payers' money.  Repeat the feeling for your basic data entry or meat packing service etc.

I'm not saying it can't work, I just think the above is why it's generally not done.  Or at least, why subsidising you in your basic pottery business to take on an unskilled unemployed apprentice is what I hear about more often.

Don't get me wrong, if the FT is correct, it's quite a screw up.  But let's look at Lilico's analysis, also in the Telegraph:

&gt;The Government's target is to eliminate the structural deficit (the bit of the budget deficit that won't go away as the economy grows) by 2014/15. In the 2011 Budget the government forecast it would achieve that a year early, and by 2014/15 be running a structural surplus of 1.9 per cent of GDP (see Table 1.3 on p24). In today's money, 1.9 per cent of GDP is some £28-£29 billion. So if the structural bit of the deficit is only £12 billion higher than forecast, that does not, by any means, force the government to change tack. Indeed, the government was forecasting a surplus even by 2013/14 of 0.8 per cent of GDP – or around £12 billion. So it might even still squeak home a year early.

It's not just £60/Wk JSA you need to take into account.  There's also Housing Benefit, Income Support, Incapacity Benefit/Employment Support Allowance, Carer's Allowance and various others Child Tax credits etc.

Lets say you are a couple; Housing Benefit is going be around £70 less £10 or so for each 'non-dependent' child still living at home, JSA is around £65 for the over 25s and IS would probably pay another £40 since the government thinks you need £105/wk to live on.  So it's not just the £60 you'd need to work for, it's more like £170, and that's not including any tax credits.  Assuming a 'four day week' to allow people 'out' for interviews you're already talking about £5.50 hr.

As others have said, you can break down those on JSA into two camps.  Those that **want** to work, and those that **don't**, to which I'd add a third group those that **can't**.  You say further up that that the **Don'ts** would just need to turn up, sit around and still get their benefits paid.  If they don't want to work, having them sit around watching a bunch of people who is hardly likely to get them motivated.  It's more likely to encourage the **wants** to just turn up and sit around as well, or probably encourage them to spend all their time looking for jobs and not bother going in the first place.  

And for manufacturing or data entry you do need at least some skills.  Ever run an industrial lathe or milling machine?  I have and it's not just a case of turning a few handles and out pops a McGuffin.  There's a reason factory workers got a 'Skilled Man's Wage'.  Data Entry? To be cost effective (i.e. make enough money to pay for the service) you need good keyboard skills at the very least.

What we should be doing is enabling those wanting to work to do so.

I'm presently having a small twitter discussion with the chap who [posted this](http://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/k5jb6/on_the_scottish_governments_consultation_on_gay/) a couple of weeks ago, and another person. I'm getting another side to the argument which apparently is *not* homophobic, rather that: ""the definition of marriage is one man one woman. Nothing more, nothing less. If we change then it's the thin end of the wedge."" etc (paraphrased)

What I find laughable is the fact that, I think, it is exactly the same sort of thing that was said about marriage when black people were angling to marry white people etc. If anyone thinks otherwise, let me know - I haven't done research into it yet. But it's highly likely that was the case (it might just have been in America). Similarly when marriage had age limits reduced or perhaps when marriage was first allowed outside of churches.

Given that gay people are being gay legally and all that is being asked is to give them the same status has heterosexual couples when it comes to legal standing as well as official ceremony, what is the problem? Homosexuality is accepted and not shunned anymore, so why stop couples from getting married?

As far as I can see it's sheer bloody mindedness from people who don't like that homosexuality is now ""OK"".

true,coriny,eng-GreaterLondon,London?,"Firstly you make the assumption that 100% employment is desirable. In fact, for various economic reasons it's not.

Ignoring that, you are creating a forced labour workforce who will be competing directly with private industry or you will be reducing the number of fully paid jobs.

Thirdly, without any incentive to reduce the number of people in workhouses, then if the scheme is profitable it is likely to be expanded - which means forcing more people out of decent paying jobs and into forced labour.

Given that it is essential for the economy that there is a set of unemployed people, why drag the real economy by forcing that cheap forced labour, who will compete directly with the private sector, without improving demand or anything.

The existence of a tiny segment of the population who parasitise a relatively small amount of the national wealth is largely due to both necessity for a flexible growing economy and the history of inequality in this country. The best thing to do, in my opinion, is force education on them so that people have the skills needed when the economy requires them.

So, I counter, why not send long termed unemployed to schools where they will be paid bonuses on top of a small basic allowance for completing vocation and educational courses (driving, cooking, maths etc). That way we will have the large numbers of moderately skilled labour that can be needed on short notice without having to import from all over the world?

I think the biggest problem that alot of people have are the values that are forced on them by Government and media, and many people see them as one and the same. This is people from both sides of the political spectrum.

Traditionally left-wing supporters don't like the free-market economics and promotion of an astronomically rich elite who are seemingly above the law. On the other hand, traditional right wingers focus more on the promotion of PC values and the apparent contempt held for anyone who isn't queueing up to convert to the new morality.

These were one of the biggest reasons that the Labour core vote decided to ditch New Labour but to be honest the Coalition appears to stand for exactly the same things, and it seems are rapidly losing the support of their own core voters (exemplified by the vitriol towards coalition policy in some of the DM comments).

In many industries in order to become particular skilful it can require decades of experience. Similarly networks take decades to build up, and greatly improve efficiency in bringing resource to demand. So you want to keep people within an industry (or linked industries) as much as possible.

Furthermore, employment stability allows those skills/networks to be passed through to newcomers, which is of overall economic value.

So I think there is real value in encouraging specialist skilled people not to go do data entry. Especially not engineers.

Kenny could have stationed Kuyt or Bellamy there, or given Downing or Henderson instructions to stay wide, either of which would probably have necessitated a 4-5-1 formation. Or, as he did a couple of times last season, he could have tried a 3-at-the-back formation, with Skrtel playing in something more like his natural position, and again Downing or Kuyt most likely to be pressed into the right-sided spot. It would be tough for the makeshift wing back, but Skrtel would have been there to cover.

It was clear even before Adam was sent off that we were overrun in midfield and being totally outclassed by Parker and Modric. Could that have been predicted? I think Kenny has been taken a little bit surprised by how useless Charlie Adam has turned out to be, but other managers clearly know that he can only play his fancy passes if he has time on the ball, and somebody like Scott Parker is well-equipped to deny him that. I think a first-half tactical substitution was on the cards; probably sacrificing a striker to bring Spearing in to even up the midfield contest.

For all **intents and purposes**, Series 1 serves as the 'beginning', and thats a very good place to start. There is always time for some fantastic Classic Who once you've exhausted the reboot and are dying a slow and agonizing death between new episodes. Further, the reboot takes care of you- despite the decades of backstory, you'll know what's going on (except when you won't, and then its even more fascinating). Starting with the Ninth enriches the relationships with the Tenth, who obviously links to the Eleventh. Skipping around jumbles the emotional roller coaster that is Doctor Who- I feel like you'd be depriving yourself.

One disclaimer- starting with Series 1 means starting with a lower budget and some rather ridiculous (among other things) aliens. Don't get discouraged- there is badassness and genius and whimsy and hilarity and tears to come. When the aliens get odious, look at r/doctorwho- there's over 26,000 people who survived them.

I have been a long time fan of British television.  Dr Who has been one of my favorites for well over 20 years now.  Red Dwarf, The Black Adder, Top Gear, Are You Being Served, and Being Human are some other shows that I've watched over the years. 

I'm up to season 2 ep 3 of Misfits as well and am absolutely riveted. It is what Heroes should have been.  

The hardest part about watching these shows is not being able to talk with my friends about them.  I mentioned Misfits to a couple of friends of mine and they just gave me blank stares, then started talking about Alphas (a show I stopped watching because I found it boring.)

Very likely, but until I get bored I'm in the business of making sure my own position is water tight (worth checking) as well as, of course, listening to the opposition to see if they have any viable arguments. At the moment, you're right - they don't seem to have one.

Neither of them actually said ""Thin end of the wedge"" but yes it can be summed up as such. When I asked why the definition of marriage can't be changed: 

&gt; ""We'll have allowed yet another change to the language - and those who control language control everything.""

Yeah... This is a brick wall, I'm thinking.

&gt; Being gay is not just 'OK'""

You're right, except that I think that there are still situations where religions *can* discriminate on sexuality. I've got a case fluttering in my memory where someone who was gay was forced out of a job in a church somewhere recently - I can't find that story, but here's an example of [a chap 'sacked' (volunteer) for being gay](http://www.pinknews.co.uk/2009/09/29/exclusive-man-fired-from-christian-radio-station-for-revealing-he-was-gay/) and [another sort of sacking](http://freethinker.co.uk/2011/01/12/priest-who-wanted-sex-with-two-gay-servicemen-is-sacked-from-london-parish/).

It is a grounds for voiding a marriage, albeit incredibly archaic. Modern marriage law is such that whether a couple have or haven't consummated is largely irrelevant; in almost every circumstance imaginable there are more modern grounds for voiding a marriage than consummation. 


Further, and without getting too legally technical, if marriage was legalized for gay couples, a court would have to construe the term consumate in a non-discriminatory manner under the Human Rights Act. If a legal power of privilege is restricted from a gay couple because of its definition, it must be redefined (within reason) to not discriminate.

That means if gay marriage was legalised, consummation (for poople odd enough to try and use it) would have to be defined as a form of sex that gay couples can take part in. That would probably result in a hilarious court judgment as judges are hopelessly bad at dealing with sex in legal terms, but it would still happen.

The only way the TARDIS could be a part of his fear is if his greatest fear was her death. In which case he still would not say of course who else, but rather something that makes sense. Such as, of course what else. 

You see, of course who else proves empirically that what is in the room is a specific person he is afraid of. Not an event, or an idea. If such were the case he would have said, of course what else. 

In conclusion.

The TARDIS dying? Of course, what else. For what else could the Doctor fear?
Failure? Of course what else. For what else could the Doctor fear?

true,[deleted],null,null,"We'd gain almost nothing from it. 

The biggest thing we'd gain is legislative freedom. I might be a bit biased as a lawyer but the biggest problem I have with the EU is poorly thought out and often continental (i.e. civil law) based principles being shoe-horned into common law courts. Ask me about the Brussels B1 Regulation if you'd like to vomit.


In terms of sovereignty, trade, influence all the arguments are, I think, pretty unpersuasive. We have 'more' sovereignty now under lisbon than we did before, and we've always had the right to leave the EU whenever we wanted by an act of parliament.

Trade is the biggest loss we'll have. We benefit enormously from free trade with the EU, and in way that most eurosceptics don't fully understand. Unlike FTAs (free trade agreements) with other countries, where a company or individual's ability to enforce their rights relies either on their country taking it up for them (which almost never happens) or a separate right of redress (which is often extremely costly, and rare in FTAs with countries of similar economic power e.g. the US). 

The EU gives all a right to use a separate independent court. This has stopped all kinds of protectionist nonsense to the benefit of the UK (one of my favourite cases is where the court threw out an attempt by the German parliament to only allow beer to be labelled beer if it was made in the german style with hops, yeast, water and grain; the court said it was retarded to think that german consumers couldn't recognize purity law beer from others, and british beer was allowed back on the shelves as beer) . In short, the enforced equality, standardization and rights you get an an EU citizen as well as a British one can't be obtained from a regular free trade agreement.


Which brings us to power. Some slightly better informed eurosceptics point to Norway and (prior to the meltdown) Iceland as examples of countries that reap the free trade benefits of the EU without being 'slaves to brussels' and all the rest of it.


Of course, what they never mention is the fact that Norway complies with 'eurocratic edicts' and the like far faster than Britain, and has a better track record of compliance with the EU than most member states. This is because to have a Norway style integration agreement we have to comply with all the EU's rules anyway (for the most part) **except we don't get any say in the matter**. When you consider the number of times the UK has tempered the EU and gotten opt outs (think about the working time directive) us leaving the EU to become a side-show member in all but name is pretty ridiculous.

The sole sticking point I can think of is immigration within the EU, but that's massively overblown. While eastern european migration to the Uk was far higher than predicted, it didn't really cause a huge negative impact on the economy, and most intra-eu migration tends to reverse itself over time anyway (many many poles have returned home or gone elsewhere, for example).

tl;dr the economic arguments against the EU are unsound, and can only be sustained by trading away any and all power we have to influence EU policy, whilst still being compelled to follow them. The only real issue I have with the EU as currently constituted is stupid legislation that makes law practically difficult in certain areas.

I'm torn on that thought. Yes, watching him play against Leverkusen and United, for the most part, was a revelation. The old Torres was back, he was lethal, excited to play, he complimented our team well instead of being a thorn in our side.

But the miss...sure, there were other times to score that could easily have gone in. Ramires should not have ruined Sturridge's shot the way he did. Torres cut through the United central defense like a hot knife through butter and came so close to scoring a well-taken volley. Maybe Lukaku and Sturridge could have had better games, they were a bit anonymous considering their entire appearances. Our defense could have been more solid, the ref could have called the game better.

But once Torres missed, that was it. We were not able to sustain another positive attack after that. That was how bad it crippled Torres, how bad it crippled Chelsea as a team. Had he netted then, the way the game was going, we would have had plenty chances to grab that equalizer. But once he missed that, it has to be said, supremely easy goal, that was it.

Secondly, consumnation is not defined to mean male/female sexual intercourse, it is just accepted as such because, at the moment, marriage is between a man and a woman.

The point is that marriage would not need any kind of significant rewrite of law (thought it might help whilst they're tinkering) because as soon as marriage between same sex couples is legalised, the courts will have to make it non-discriminatory to comply with the HRA:

http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1998/42/section/3

&gt;So far as it is possible to do so, primary legislation and subordinate legislation must be read and given effect in a way which is compatible with the Convention rights.

The above is impossible for **marriage itself** which is defined at present as between a man and a women (there is a case that I've forgotten the name of where the House of Lords overturns the appeals court for trying to turn a man into a woman and a woman into a man, commenting that though it is unfair and may be discriminatory, a court can only interpret, not rewrite, legislation. ) but is completely possible for the definition of consumnation. 



As to your wider point which I've apparently missed, that's also bullshit.

Certainly, some gay and lesbian couples might want nothing to do with what they perceive as a biased and unfair institution, but as should be patently obvious from the support the gay community gives to legalizing marriage, **many of them do not**.

I think you're right, though.

I don't know if that was a rant or not that went off batshit crazy about crop-circles or not, but basically, the TL/DR verson: Ten redeemed himself, by literally stepping voluntarily forward to his existential death, understanding the reasons for his actions, understanding what he had to do, and doing it.

true,Kay_Elle,k9,K-9,"&gt; Her relationship with the doctor is a weird one. She's known of him since she was six, and had ""romantic"" ideas of running away with him on adventures all since then. She worships him and sees him as more than he is, saving her life countless times and forgetting he's responsible for nearly all of them.

I do agree on the weird relationship. And I don't think she's a tramp, but I do think these things get mixed up easily. Even with Rose, we've seen that human/timelord relationships are never quite on a level playing field, but we are led to believe ther was *something* there.

We know from ""God complex"" that Amy basically *adores* the doctor, in quite the literal sense. While this is not exactly the same as romantic love, in a way, it can be stronger, and it makes perfect sense the tension would be there. I just wasn't too happy about it being played out over and over again.

But the point is, this sort of dynamic really only works if there is an imbalance of power (and I'm not saying there's abuse of power, per se). But it only works because the Doctor is a Timelord, and takes people on amazing adventures.

The RTD era did occasionally veer a bit too far into the Doctor-as-Jesus-for-secularists thing. There were a few too many episodes where two non-Doctor characters would have a conversation about how *wonderful* the Doctor was, and a few too many situations in which the Doctor would adopt *ridiculously* high moral standards (which he never managed to apply consistently, a point usually glossed over the next time it came to press the big red button which wipes out the alien menace).

The Moff era, on the other hand, has perhaps recently veered a bit *too* far into the moral deconstruction of the Doctor territory.

But since Gibbis was picked up alone...  well, why was he picked up at all, if the Minotaur knew he couldn't use him? Also, he's not offered a way out. For the longest time, I though he might be a mole/accomplice. I'm still not out on that one.

- As for the Who Else? Yes, I believe The Doctor saw himself. In what situation, we don't know, but possibly his own demise.

- I think both based on the interaction with the Minotaur and the fact that the Doctor gets his own room, I think he does believe in something, or did.

I would go out on a limb and say the Doctor believes in *himself*. But instead of feeling fear as he looks at himself, he realizes his hubris.

Therefore, he loses his blind faith in his own abilities, making him unappealing to the monster. Only after he loses the endless faith in himself, he can recognize the worship Amy feels for him (he's not ready yet in ""The girl Who Waited"") and can he choose to break that worship.

He's not just telling Amy he's a mad man with a box - he has accepted it, for himself.
