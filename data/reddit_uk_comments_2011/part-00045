It really has to be this, doesn't it?  I knew you knew really.  I've been pondering similar ideas for a while (albeit without your impressive clarity at working out the background dates).  

Part of me wonders if the show only chooses to use real dates (26.06.10 &amp; 22.04.11) to help viewers identify with the show, and they don't care so much about the workings out of making it all fit properly.  I'd like to think this is not the case, but I wouldn't be too desolate if they fudge the figures, so long as they explain what happened and when in the missing bits where the silence started mucking about.  

Hopefully Michael York is gonna be in the second half of the series, as Basil Exposition, and we can sit down and have a chat with him, and he'l make it all OK.

In a similar way there is nothing which *actually* stops all the jittering molecules in my body aligning to counteract gravity, sending me flying into the air at a speed appropriate to their thermal energy.

And yet we have statistical physics telling us that this is just not going to happen if you sit around and wait for it. (Obviously social mobility is not so difficult as this but .. )
Microscopic laws do not tell us anything about these collective physical 'laws' which are very much real. (I mean we build a lot of dangerous shit which depends on these principles!)

If you don't take into account probabilistic factors, collective constraints and so on you are not able to explain collective phenomena. 

So these apologists are people trying to explain on a social level (like doing stat. mech.) vs. an individual level (say microscopic equations of motion). 

I realise that individuality will have an effect in a group of people, but riots and panics (and conflicts in hard times) are exactly the kinds of situations where we loose this agency. Therefore this is when we really need to look at the collective motivations (using sociology not physics obviously).

In the broader context, means to control groups of people has been perfected to a fine art via propaganda, PR, marketing, ... And they do use the methodology of physics in fact, at least as a source for inspiration.

All of these methods are definitely used to control people today. And yes, to exclude and discriminate (especially when it is good for making money).

true,The3rdWorld,eng-essex,Essex,"I can certainly get behind the idea it's greed, everyone wants to be a billionheir so freakin badly these days and these false aspirations are fed by the media endlessly -mtv cribbs and the fake lives of dappytwat half-rappers (and i hate on them so hard as a rap lover) constantly waving massive wads of diamonds around as if being rich isn't enough you need to pointlessly prove you're causing others to suffer (diamond trade is evil)  
  
The spread of greed in our society is a socio-economic problem, it's a corporatist world ever increasing the advertising ratchet around our hearts and our brains - girls like rich men, only rich men get respect, rich people can break any laws they want, rich people just laze around having fun... all tropes painfully common in our media whether true or not, and to a certain degree they are all true.  
  
We must wonder though why so many people are willing to buy into greed so much they're willing to smash places and hurt people in order to get consumer crap.  When you live in a community where every the police have special units that harass you, when you get pulled over when ever you drive anywhere in your shit car but your pusherman's bimmer never gets tugged...  When the few good role models you have are working like fucking dogs and prostrating themselves daily until they're tired husks crushed into dust by some twist of fate pr tory legislation then how is anyone supposed to rationally think 'i want to be like them, not this rapper who used to sell rock but now pimps it big style in a high roller rocking it gang-star style.  
   
It is fucking horrible to be poor in our society in this day and age - in that i speak from experience, even though i have a massive advantage over most people in that my two loving parents educated me on how to think and how to educate myself i'm still endlessly fucked over by the system - the media world of bling endlessly depresses me, how do they have so much to waste while i can't even get a little to spend wisely?  again, i've been furnished by my hippy parents with a non-consumerist mind; while others were getting suckered into disneyworld and faux-jetset holiday packages we were learning about permaculture and the pleasures of sustainable living - yet even though i envy those that live modestly i still have to envy them rather than emulate them (even the ones i could do much better)  
  
the way we think about 'the lower classes', of which you are a member and so's the buy-to-let twat below and the bankers and almost everyone else, we're treating them as a commodity, our society is designed to fuck us over.  Any why wouldn't it be?  did you learn about the time in history where the queen held up her hands and said, oh actually i the state am the people is rather vile, what were they thinking?  We need a modern perspective not a 14th century feudal ideology.  
  
The polltax riots weren't just about the polltax laws or the tory cuts, if you really look into them there is a heck of a lot of talk about the class system and the social structure - they tend to iron that out for the official histories, it's too complex a story to tell - or they just don't want to.  but yes, of course it was easier to describe what you were against back then, maybe the problem is the system has become so carefully insidious that explaining your contempt has been made almost impossible by clever limiting of language (see the essay at the end of 1984 and pretty much anything chomsky ever wrote) 
  
The way our nation wastes billions on wars for oil and pretends it's for humanitarian reasons at the very same time they aren't giving a fuck who their bombs land on or how their psycho troops torture prisoners - i know i'm not the only person that see's how storming into an oil rich nation because their leader was kinda mean then grabbing people from the streets with basically no evidence they're involved and torturing them in the most disgusting ways is objectively absurdly evil. 
  
People see these things happen and they see big stories about it in the press, nothing happens - it's  exactly the same when something happens in their area and they try to have their say and everything gets twisted, mangled in a legal machine and automatically they're in the wrong and the rich are getting away with terrible things while the poor get shit on.  The us an them mentality comes about because it's a good approximation of the fact.  
  
So yes this is about the problem that everyone wants to be a billionhair but it's also about not feeling 'part' of the society - while i would love to be rich so i could go all Tolstoy i'm pretty sure most people want to be rich because in us vs them it's a lot better in the other camp.  I agree we are all to blame but i think the policies of the government in the way they try to structure society are very much the root cause of our societies ills, i listen to terrible rap music and i know what they're talking about - it's reactionary, it demanding respect; thats why diamonds and bling are so popular - it's a way of demanding the respect you missed out on in your early life.  
  
This is why refined british gentry never show off, they don't need to - they already got all the respect anyone could comprehend.  Expecting people to skip steps on whatever version of Maslow's hierarchy of needs leads to modern happiness simply isn't do able, while people are in a society which doesn't respect them they're going to feel unrespected and take methods to fix that.  What do you think gangs are?  they're group support networks for kids desperate for respect, hence the tags the fronting the colours - it's not hard to understand.  
  
We need our society to respect people, we need people to legitimately feel respect so as to satiate their human need for respect - when this is done then maybe people will start to calm down and begin all getting along.  Oh and just telling people they need to earn respect isn't good enough, certainly if you don't let them earn respect or ignore when they do.",0,1313143736,null,0,false,0,c2bxi47,t3_jf255,t1_c2bxi47,t1_c2bwx8p,1427462329,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

As far as I understand it, your points are correct, but I'd take issue with the TL;DR (which actually isn't a summary of your points at all): it's hardly surprising that people who don't understand a complex subject have strong opinions about it. 

Example dear to my heart: when the govt. threatened to sell of the English forest estate, there was an outcry. Everybody had very strong opinions about it. Did all of these people understand multiple-objective forest management, the historical background, the relevant laws, the relationship between timber production and biodiversity, the pros and cons of private-sector forest management...? Did they fuck! Were they entitled to express a view? Yes, I think they were.

**Point 1**

What you've described there is greed. Your system makes money, sure, but you lose sight of what you're doing. You lose sight of the damage you're inflicting on peoples lives, and you lose connection to your responsibility. ""Everyone wants to make more money"" = greed. When you pursue profit, at whatever the cost, you are greedy.

**Point 2**

I would agree that it was a complex network of problems that caused the failure, but that's only part of the story. That system of complex insurance packages, backed up debt, repackaged debt and the rest of it was a system designed by greed. We might look at the complexity of an engine failure and claim ""it was a complex failure of the whole system"", but without looking at the values and decisions made during that systems design, we won't get anywhere.

The fact remains that the system was built on greed, and going back historically, it's even more clear that central banking was designed to benefit the few at the expense of the many.

People shouting ""jail the bankers"" are expressing their contempt at a political system that protects white collar crime whilst punishing blue collar crime as much as it can. It's a populist expression and nothing more. For example, those that shout that phrase may be referring to the injustice in tax havens costing the UK more than benefit fraud, but it's the benefit fraudsters that are targeted by the establishment.

**Point 3**

Fine.

**Point 4**

See Iceland, where the banks were allowed to fail. The Government should have guaranteed all savings and nationalised the banks - entirely.

Yes there would have been huge social upheaval, but people are looking at that decsion now and thinking that it has only prolonged the inevitable. I, and this is only my opinion, look at the current financial system we operate under and I  genuinely want it to fail. We have a growth based economy that ceases to work when growth stops, and if that's the case, the system will either fail, or we will destroy the planet. Something has to give.

Looking back to the bailout, we saw a failed system being guaranteed at the expense of tax payers for another five years or so.

**Point 5**

Let's have this discussion.

**Point 6**

This goes back to my point about growth. Everyone under this system is trying desperately to find some growth. In the boom years, the banks stimulated this by loaning left right and centre, and those loans - imaginary wealth - had to be turned into real wealth. Houses were built, mines were exploited etc.

We're now in this twilight period where banks have stopped stimulating that growth because they're scared it can't continue and they won't get their money back, but at the same time, their refusal to lend is killing our growth based economy, so they're slowly strangling themselves to death.

This is why the system has to collapse and we wander into debating point five.

**Point 7**

We will not get that money back. We are prolonging the inevitable. We threw paper on some dying flames, and sure as eggs are eggs, that paper will burn up like the rest of their toxic assets. We won't be growing our way out of this mess, because you can't continue to grow on a finite planet. Everyone who understands this hates the banking system.

**Point 8**

I'm angry about my stake in that company - I didn't want it. I thought it was a shitty idea from the get go. I don't believe in the company, I don't believe in their vision of an economy, and I don't believe I'll ever get that money back, no matter how much I 'play the game' and talk the banks up. 

Finally,

Everyone has a right to be angry at the banking system, because it's clear that this is their crisis, and it's been brewing for decades, not just a few years.

Shouting hang the bankers is popular rhetoric for what I think is an entirely justified disgust for the banks. People are finally figuring out who controls their lives, and it is indeed the banks.

I'm not sure how much you could re-coop asset stripping MBS traders and CEOs but Britain has a lot of very large banks and I imagine you'd come out quite far ahead. 

And yes maybe none of them were doing anything illegal at the time but plenty of us knew that the system was immoral and left it, so fuck em.

I don't pretend to understand what really caused the riots (no-one does yet), but the huge HUGE gap between rich and poor in this country and the general feeling of disenfranchisement that caused undoubtedly played a part at least for some. To that end you could have stopped at your title and and been about as accurate. People *may well* not know what they are talking about, but *perception* matters. Many people think the bankers are to blame for the mess the country is in, and that they have not only got away scott free, they have actually been rewarded for failure! Whether that is true or not dosn't matter, it's what people believe happeneed. 

And you know what? You have done nothing to convince me they are wrong. Yes the system is extremely complex, I know that, I am not completely clueless about economics (one of the reasons I wasn't out looting... Others include common decency and a sense of right and wrong!) 

1) it *was* caused by greed, you said yourself it was because they wanted money. Just because those methods had worked before and everyone wanted money doesn't mean it wasn't greed!

2) A fundamental failure of the system makes it somehow *better* that the system was propped up and apparently nothing has changed? 

3) I have no idea about this, I'll have to take your word for it, but would remind you that hindsight is 20/20!

4) Yes there are very good reasons for the banks not to just collapse, but as I said earlier - perception matters! It is up to the government and bankers to convince us otherwise, and nothing has been done to do so, so the rumour sticks around! 

5) then let's *have* that discussion, fully, frankly and in public. Make us believe something might change! 

6) this one confuses me too! However it can (and has been) argued that banks have gone too far the other way and are now far too conservative with regards lending money, meaning small businesses find it harder to get off the ground and struggling businesses find it hardee to survive. There is a fine balance to strike here, and I'm not convinced it is right this time either!

Another good book I am reading now is [_Participatory Economics_](http://www.zcommunications.org/zparecon/pareconlac.htm), it is better for specifically attacking the market (and also the traditional planned economy) for various matters. It is more based on running all businesses as co-operatives, and having the government emerge from that, a bit like William Morris' _News From Nowhere_. I don't know how practical it is though, because I don't know how many people really want to have to manage their lives in that way.

But I don't think anyone would argue that technology has to be planned ahead, or that competition is entirely eliminated.

There was one system there where we would click a button in one program which would copy all the S/Os and DDs from one app, then we pasted them into a spreadsheet in excel, and it ran a macro which did some stuff with that... then we printed that out and sometimes even had to enter them back in to another program manually if they didn't transfer properly (which was due to a single fixable problem).

The funny thing here is that this system has been used for years but there was a bug in the spreadsheet macro which formatted one of the cells wrong and took all the leading zeroes off the references (auto formatting rather than text)... so for years  there were random DDs or S/Os that didn't get set up correctly (when people were transferring their accounts from Halifax), and NO ONE in all this time even had the slightest inkling as to why.... I figured it out in no time, looked through the macro in a language i'd never even used before and found a single character that had been typed wrong 4-5 years ago had caused countless hundreds of hours of extra work over that time.

There is also the problem that all political systems have, but socialism just seems to make far more visible, which is the problem of people not doing what they are supposed to do. Which means that your plans don't work because they were based on a poor interpretation of data, or even worse pure ideology, and often the next response seems to be an attempt to force people to fit the plans rather than changing the plans because they don't actually work. You can see an example of this in the way that Nu-Labour's response to so many issues of their plans not working with new laws that were designed to force people to behave in ways which were closer to their models. I'm not saying that the Tories or LD's are free from this or other problems, but personally it's something I really don't like about the left. 

As for collectives, they can work, but you need to factor things like Dunbars Number into them.

 After the dotcom bubble interest rates were set at a rather low level. This meant that buying a house was easier than ever. The investment agencies and banks looked at the mortgage  Market as a reliable, safe and beneficial place to invest (the assumption was housing prices would only go up for a long time and that people who couldn't afford a house would see their property rise in value anyways). This benefited everyone for a number of years and subprime mortgages seemed all right. Now the credit agencies would have been able to tell a risky investment such as this but for one thing.  These mortages were bundled into complex financial packages and sold to various banks ect. So what should have been rated as a risky investment was now getting a triple a credit rating and no one had any idea of their liabilities or the risks they were taking.

This was all fine until houses started to dip in price. Now some of the people who shouldn't of had the house started defaulting. And as the housing Market started to crash more and more defaulted causing significant losses in the banks. But they had no idea of the full extent of their liabilities...or other banks liabilities. And so banks which usually lend to each other stopped doing so. 
Businesses were also finding it difficult to get loans but most importantly customers were taking money out of the banks. And then you have a crises of credit. 

No one could have predicted the full set of events that occurred or the full root causes. You had a few people to warn of this before the crises; the ft, Vince cable ect but no one had any idea the extent of the banks liabilities, how pervasive these financial packages had become and the complete incompetence of the credit rating agencies.

Thatcher was a reactionary and you do not understand her unless you are old enough to remember what she was reacting against or you study history to learn what happened before you were born. 

In the 1960's social problems were the fault ""of society"" and had to be mended by ""society"". Thatcher saw the buck being passed to an uninhabited abstraction. No-one would own up to being the member of society who wasn't pulling their weight. Thatcher reacted against this and declared ""there is no such thing as society"" meaning that mothers should bring up their children and not leave it to ""society"" (social workers?) and that fathers should encourage their children and not leave it to ""society"" (school? careers advisor?).

Yeah, ParEcon covers that a bit IIRC. Especially with regards to possible communal living communities.

I can see what you mean, and I used to be a social democrat, but after reading _The Ragged Trousered Philanthropists_ I saw there were much bigger problems. For example, the concept of the private ownership of land and resources which gives rise to great inequality, the system of employment which always leads to unemployment and even makes it beneficial to those with power, the existence of those who can live solely on the products of others' labour - usually from property ownership, i.e. with landlords, shareholders, etc., and of course, the financial crises caused by repeated collapses in consumer demand arising from the gap between wages and the price of goods sold.

Meanwhile globalisation makes it ever harder to make that change, as increasing taxes just means businesses and wealthy individuals will move elsewhere. A bit like Atlas Shrugged, except far from being the productive members of society, they are simply those who old it to ransom through the ownership of capital. It also undercuts wages and destroys the power of unions, the backbone to the Scandinavian tripartite economy.

If you believe we are ever going to see a decent return on this “investment” I would love to hear your reasoning.  UK taxpayers currently own 84% of RBS. We paid ~50p a share or almost £45 billion.  As I write this, RBS shares are currently worth 26p each so that’s a nice £22 billon loss (yes yes short term I know but please read on)

Also with RBS there is the £60 billon loan insurance scheme for the toxic loans still on the RBS books.  This deal was written to allow RBS to continue trading and obtain insurance for these lending activities. 

This deal hinges on the option that in the event of the loans RBS made going bad, RBS will pay the first  £60 billon and the UK taxpayers will lend them the rest.  It’s a pity that RBS don’t have this money and probably never did. 

The reality is it’s almost impossible to see the UK taxpayers ever getting the initial $45 billon back and it’s almost certain that by the end of 2011 we will be paying out many billons more. RBS has around  14.5 billon exposed to the UK mortgage market. If people start to default on their mortgages the taxpayers will become liable for the insurance on the loan if RBS cannot meet the demands (and they probably don’t have the money)

This is just for RBS.  UK taxpayers are heavily invested in Lloyds/TSB.

Banks across  the world are trying to sell assets now to shore up their books. UniCredit &amp; Intesa in Italy have suspended their shares several times this week. Bank of America (value dropped $32 billon so far this week) is trying to sell Asian assets to anyone who shows an interest.  In the US Fannie and Freddie are asking for another $7 billon from the US Fed while BoA hopes to sell assets onto Fannie Mae.


The idea that eventually we might get our money back from the “investment” we made on the banks is naïve at best.

I don't see how you can claim Barclays came through mostly unscathed. They've certainly been putting that PR around, but they went as bust as everyone else. They borrowed heavily from the government (or however that mechanism really worked) and then sold a large stake with exceptional powers to a Chinese investor in order to have access to enough capital to stay afloat. And as far as I understand they got a worse deal than the government offered, but they got the 'bragging rights' of not needing a direct bail-out.

And as an aside, I've banked with RBS &amp; Barclays for most of a decade. Barclays are currently becoming more and more like RBS were 7-8 years ago. Their internal systems appear to be a mess, and at the consumer banking level it's increasingly staffed by under-trained low quality staff &amp; call centres.

true,sync0pate,uk,West Mids,"I'm one of the people who writes that, repeatedly, and IMHO, I don't think you know what you're talking about.
  
**1)** As pointed out, it was caused largely by greed. A lot of it was to do with lending far too much money to people who could obviously not afford to pay it back, then offsetting the fact it would never be paid back by selling off these bad debts in the form of credit default swaps. Lending a bunch of people money who can't afford to pay it back then selling off the debt in big packages sounds pretty greedy and short-sighted to me.

**2) As you put it-  
&gt;The banking failure was a systematic failure of the whole banking sector, regulators and the government* *
  
Yes. This is why I blame the whole banking sector, the regulators, and the government. I don't give a damn whether what they did was a crime or not, it was immoral. If it's not a crime, that's a fault in the law. Jail the bankers? Exile the bankers.

**3) Nobody is shouting ""Jail only the bankers who worked for RBS""**.  
Anyone with an ounce of common sense knows that all the banks were committing exactly the same errors of judgement. The reason all the anger is directed towards RBS is because of the bailouts they received. We all own a little bit of them, so feel more justified in telling them what to do I guess.

*4)* Let the financial system collapse. I know for someone that works in finance that probably sounds like sheer idiotic madness to you, but I mean it. I understand the implications and I'm deadly serious. As far as I'm concerned it did fail. The working class felt it collapse, but the people within the industry were protected from it. As someone else here pointed out - privatised profits and socialised losses. We felt the losses, we have never and will never see the profits.  

*5)* Yes there is a valid discussion here, and it is a complex one, but banker-bashing is not a part of it. Banker-bashing doesn't help this discussion, but it is needed anyway.  

*6)* They've gone from one extreme to another, this is the same reactionary attitude that got them into the mess. What's wrong with taking a sensible approach to lending? They're lending too cautiously to bolster their profits (even with banks where it's not needed). but anyway, I kind of agree with you on this that a lot of people don't know what they're talking about here.  

7) We didn't give all those billions to the banks, we lent them it.  
We've got billions to lend banks, but no money for doctors, nurses, education. I'd bet we'd show a lot more of a profit if the money were put into free education.

8) I agree with you here, but it's not the bank-bashing that's costing us money. They're handling the problem wrongly sure, but that doesn't mean there's not a problem.  

9) Agreed.

I am greedy, I want as much as I can have that my wage packet and conscience will afford. I won't go looting because my conscience is strong enough to overcome desire for things, helped massively by having a decently paid job. I plan to save up as a long term game for getting something bigger than new clothes, a nice house in which to contain my stuff. I do try to be reasonably frugal but I can't deny that I do want some things that I could live perfectly well without.

Like all dangerous impulses, greed needs to be carefully regulated. You make sure people get enough to satisfy them and put the boundaries up to stop them going OTT.

The bankers and MPs were allowed too much freedom with their greed and they couldn't help themselves. 

The looters have had their greed repressed too much for too long and something snapped. As soon as they thought they could get away with taking what they wanted all hell broke loose, they couldn't help themselves. Naturally plenty of wealthier people joined in with looting too, since they were in the middle of the storm and it looked like a free-for-all; it's pretty predictable.

It can be hard for benefit recipients to secure housing without a deposit or simply because landlords can be rather choosey and discriminate against benefit recipients who can be seen as high risk tenants.

true,Ivashkin,null,null,"&gt; Perhaps the notion that a change in political party at the helm can fix things is a problem in itself by taking an opposite approach to the previous government and correcting their failings as though all the problems are the fault of the previous governments policies and nothing else.

And yet, as a nation, we are still torn between the vocal minorities espousing extremes like communism or libertarianism as a solution to all our faults from their armchairs, and a far quieter majority who need to have a conversation about exactly which direction we want to see our nation take over the next generation. Everything is so short term these days, and that why politics is failing us.

 &gt; Perhaps we the people too easily absolve ourself of responsibility with our collective indifference to the political process and our perceived ability to effect change. Perhaps things are changing or can change as we ourselves are more easily able to voice our opinions and seek out alternative viewpoints. 

We have a problem with a society which espouses individual rights  as supreme while at the same time talking about collective responsibilities instead of individual responsibilities. 

&gt; Never before have so many informational resources and means of communication been available to us which actually means we are living in a state of flux as we cope to adapt to this new interconnected world.

you completely fail to understand that the people rioting are no worse off than anyone on a low income. i know many people who have lost jobs, jobs that paid enough for them to get by, but are now better off on benefits... they have more disposable income.

true,whencanistop,eng-GreaterLondon,Greater London,"This is what annoys me the most about the situation and why I think it is related to the riots.

The rich were bailed out during the financial crisis, effectively, whilst the poor weren't.  Whilst the banks were bailed out, many of those traders kept their jobs and those that lost theirs soon found new ones as the banking system is back exactly how it was before hand.  The poor on the other hand have had to have to deal with stinging cuts to services.

And yet the situation where the banks can fail and we have to bail them out is still a possibility because there is a lack of regulation.  


 Last January a report suggested that the richest 10% were 100 times richer than the poorest 100% ([source](http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/2010/jan/27/unequal-britain-report)).  This isn't about how poor people are, it is about how poor they are in comparison to the rich people.

The maximum weekly amounts you can claim are:

16 - 25 year olds = £50.95
25 year olds and over = £64.30


If you are sick then the benefits would be different.  It used to be that incapacity benefit was paid.

short-term (lower rate)	£71.10 

short-term (higher rate)	£84.15	
long-term basic rate   £94.25	


You may be able to get extra benefit - an 'age addition' - with your long-term Incapacity Benefit. You may be able to get this if you were under 45 when you became too ill or disabled to work.

Weekly rate during the assessment phase

A single person aged under 25	 up to £53.45
 A single person aged 25 and over	 up to £67.50

Weekly rate during the main phase
The main phase starts from week 14 of your claim, if the Work Capability Assessment shows that your illness or disability does limit your ability to work.

A single person in the Work Related Activity Group	 up to £94.25
 A single person in the Support Group	 up to £99.85

Open your eyes dude, do you really think the riots are down to Liberal agenda? What about the riots in Burnley in the 90's, Liverpool in the 80's, all under Tory rule? An I'd call the Tories in the 80's/90's the furthest thing from liberal. 

The thing I find funny about Phillips the most, and some may disagree on which party the Daily Mail supports, but Phillips is a Tory at heart, and the funny thing is, David Cameron, and the whole Tory party has had to become so Liberal, move so much from the right to appeal to the left it could not be recognised at the conservative party, even then it could not get to power without the Liberals, so really, shouldn't Phillips be sucking the dick of Liberals, considering it's what got her Tory piss shit in to power, and the Liberal attitude is the only reason the Tory's are still there. 

Go look at opinion polls, labour lead, they would win in a landslide. It's lucky Nick and Vince are such Liberals and stick to agreements (just not with voters).

Don't get me wrong, I'd rather have the Tories for now along with the Liberals personally. I will never vote for Cameron as he has shown a clear lack in decision making, played a key part in the phone hacking saga and is only now taking action on the riots and too top it all off, is seriously looking at giving Police powers to snoop on social networks sites. (Sounds more like China, than the UK). 

I will never vote for Labour, as I can never forgive them for all the lies, all the deciet, the two Illegal wars, the only thing they got the UK number 1 at was most hated country in the world.

1) Laura Johnson has not been convicted of the theft of the goods in question. At this point you cannot claim that as fact, as you did in this title;

2) The man who was sentenced to six months for the theft of £3.50 worth of water bottles pleaded guilty to the theft and has been convicted;

3) In all likelihood, Laura Johnson will not be convicted of *theft* of the £5k worth of goods. She was arrested because she was driving a car, with two passengers, in which the goods were found. I expect the most she will be convicted of, if at all, is handling stolen goods. I doubt there will be sufficient evidence to convict her of the theft;

4) If and when Laura Johnson *is* convicted, it is likely she will be sentenced to at least six months. Given the value of the stolen goods, it's quite possible she will be referred to the Crown Court for sentencing and receive a longer sentence;

5) The decision whether or not to release someone on police bail will take into account a number of factors. In this case, it will take into account the likelihood of returning to the riots and reoffending — I am sure Johnson has shown a great deal of remorse, unlike many others going through the courts, and her parents will likely be sufficiently embarrassed by the charges and media coverage to prevent any further shenanigans — and also the possibility that they will skip bail.

Doctor Who for me helped change a very dark time in my life by helping me realize that you don't have to be super special to be worth a damn.  Even the most regular Joe in existence can save the world in the right situation and everyone can ""live better"" even without the crazy time/space travels by standing up when something is wrong.

Doctor Who is about accepting those who are different from you.  They don't fight aliens because they are aliens, they always give the aliens a chance because aliens are people too.  It's about heroes, it's about hope, it's the best damn show I've ever seen.

And in the five months (two were lurking) I've been in r/doctorwho I've seen nothing but hatred and shit from anyone who doesn't ""share the hivemind"" as you said earlier.  The people who I expected to be open and accepting only act so if you happen to fall into the very specific set of opinions that the majority holds.  Sure there are some wonderful people on here, but most of the ones I've interacted with have not been.  It's made me jump to being cynical and sarcastic whenever I'm here more so than other places.

When a handful of people pushed for more original content and less cake pictures we were met with a heavy-handed backlash of downvotes and curses and told to ""leave if we didn't like it.""  Several people (myself included) have suggested mini-projects or other positive things that would make the community more entertaining.  More hatred and shit.  All Whovians with all their different opinions aren't welcome here it seems.

2. Kompany, De Jong, A. Johnson, Silva, Yaya, and Agureo. Dzeko and Ballitelli need to gel with our other strikers which will be key. As we saw last season, Johnson being on the pitch had a huge reflection of how well we did. 

3. I would have to say Everton, Liverpool, and oddly Aston Villa who have a team that can't be overlooked. All the teams in the EPL have strengthened so it's going to be a tough year. 

4. After Nasri signs, I think it will come down to the retainment of Shaun Wright-Phillips. If he stays, I feel we will be fine. If he goes I would expect (as Mancini said) for us to buy a winger or a right sided midfielder.

...we've been reading a lot about the ""middle class"" rioters, and the kids who got busted. Anyone else thinking that this demographic doesn't necessarily reflect a cross-section of the rioters, but rather, a cross-section of *the ones that got caught*?

I suspect that when it was all happening, the plod were more inclined and able to arrest the easy targets - kids, inept white collar workers out for a bit of a rumble - than the more angry, more violent, hardcore louts.

Arresting the ringleaders would have taken more time, and involved more police and more risk - none of that would have looked attractive at the time; on the other hand, getting the arrest rate up with a few soft targets looks pretty understandable to me.

If this is true, making sociological generalisations based on what's currently going through the courts (i.e. today's newspapers) is a bit silly.

I know that was a generalisation. It is not intended to imply that everyone who's been nabbed was some sort of trivial incidental criminal, OR that the police were being negligent (if anything, I'm accusing them of being rational on this occasion).

Laura Johnson is different in that she entered a not guilty plea at her first hearing, and has not yet been convicted of any wrongdoing.

(I suppose this probably my only complaint with the series in general, is how often they get out of binds because ""well actually the sonic screwdriver can do *this*"" or ""actually the TARDIS can do *that*"", just a lot of Deus Ex Machina; I suppose it's part of the show and I still love it to death).

If the absorption monster was creepier and less campy and if Ursula died instead of staying as a face on a tile, then it would probably go down as one of my favorite episodes.

""She was one of many people who owed the Doctor a debt: she had awoken during the construction of part of the London Underground and had wanted to take revenge on innocent tunnel workers for the deaths of her ""sisters""; the Doctor convinced her not to give in to rage. Vastra instead made a home in London, disguising her Silurian form to most people and acting as a freelance adventuress.""

""Vastra appeared to know the Doctor very well, referring to him as an old friend. She knew the Doctor well enough that when she asked him how Melody could have become a Time Lord, she attempted to be delicate because she knew how he could blush. Also when the Doctor's anger got the better of him she repeated the words that he had told her when he stopped her from killing the tunnel diggers. Vastra was also quite knowledgeable about the Time Lords, knowing about their ability to regenerate. She also had knowledge of the Untempered Schism and the Time Vortex, which showed a considerable knowledge of time itself. Vastra suspected that the reason Melody Pond was part Time Lady was because she had been conceived in the TARDIS while it was travelling through the Time Vortex.""

&gt;Rose: You can't let 'em run around inside of dead people!

&gt;Nine: Why not? It's like recycling.

&gt;Rose: Seriously, though, you can't.

&gt;Nine: Seriously though I can!

&gt;Rose: But, it's just... wrong! Those bodies were living people, we should respect 'em, even in death!

&gt;Nine: Do you carry a donor card?

&gt;Rose: That's different, that's...

&gt;Nine: It is different, yeah, it's a different morality. *Get used to it or go home.*


I'd forgotten how many fantastic lines there are in Steven Moffat's first episode, The Empty Child/The Doctor Dances. ♥

&gt;""Look at you, beaming away like you're Father Christmas!""

&gt;""Who says I'm not redbicyclewhenyouweretwelve.""

&gt;""What?""

&gt;‎""You got the moves? Show me your moves.""

&gt;""Rose... I'm trying to resonate concrete...""

&gt;Rose: Is this you dancing? Cos I've got notes.

&gt;Doctor: [examining Rose's hands] Hanging from a rope, thousands of feet above London - not a cut, not a bruise.

&gt;Rose: Yeah, I know, Captain Jack fixed me up--

&gt;Doctor: Oh, we're calling him Captain Jack now are we?

&gt;Rose: Well, his name's Jack, and he's a Captain...

&gt;Doctor: He's not really a Captain, Rose.

&gt;Rose: D'you know what I think? I think you're experiencing Captain envy... [dancing] You'll find your feet at the end of your legs; you may care to move them.

&gt;Doctor: If ever he was a Captain, he's been defrocked.

It is not anyone's job but (mutually) their own to cater to their needs of community. People without build decent communities under their own steam. Communities constitute people.

Or something similar. If you disable cell service, then you are cutting people off from the emergency services. and that would cause more problems than it was worth. The functionality is there in the networks though, in times of panic they can disabled all but a select group of phones quite easily (this is done by IMEI white listing). by area or for the entire country. 

I think what is most likely to happen is that we will get a hastily drafted and shoddy law that will allow the home secretary to order firms to disabled services. So that if it happens again, they will be able to order RIM to disable BBM for London for 24hrs or so, or order the mobile operators to disable their networks relay functions in certain areas.

The article mentions that:
&gt;Conservative-run Wandsworth Council has issued an eviction notice to a council tenant whose son has appeared in court charged in connection with Monday night's disturbances in Clapham Junction.

They're evicting a parent for their child's activities. Now, let's say, no matter what the likelihood of this is, that this parent simply has an unruly child that they cannot control - and they do exist. I used to live near a lad who smacked his mother about and she wouldn't call the police because he was her son. I doubt this is the only case though. If they cannot control their child, why should they be evicted for their child's criminality?

It's always about 'fair consequences' it seems with things like this. We WANT someone to 'feel the burn' so to speak for what has happened, as long as they are somehow to blame for it happening. It's not exactly the most firm or fair of building blocks to structure a justice system on.

true,[deleted],null,null,"I've been thinking about the TARDIS exploding, and I'm not quite sure about that yet, but I'm very aware there is something being held back by Moffat.

I can guarantee one thing, though. The entity who caused the TARDIS to explode is connected to the entity from episode two who whispered something through the just-opened door to the bloke in charge of the children's home where the young River was held.

To expand, when ~~Badger~~ Canton Delaware was talking to the supervisor of the home, there was a knock on the door, and a whispered conversation (which we all assumed was the Silents), and then the Silent turned up seconds later. Why would a Silent hide behind a door to whisper instructions and leave, only to openly enter the room seconds later? He/it wouldn't. The person who *did* whisper behind the door is linked to (if not the actual) person behind what is really going on.

I suspect he/they exploded the TARDIS for the exact purpose of creating the cracks for the sole purpose of creating the mixed realities we are now seeing. It was not an accident of time, but a deliberate attempt to change reality. We have not met this entity yet, but we will during the next half of the season.

Also, the 'something has happened to time' line fits with what I've proposed has happened here, as already explained. In the normal universe, the Silents were not on Earth at all.

One in which sentencing had already occurred (i.e. bail is completely out of the question) and the other in which individuals had presumably been convicted and were remanded in custody awaiting sentencing. Completely incomparable.

&gt; Even those awaiting sentencing after pleading guilty were refused bail. 

That's not surprising or unusual in the slightest.

&gt; And then tell me that this girl being bailed was ordinary given the way the rest of the cases were handled. For all your talk of not likely to reoffend compare that to the case in the article about the guy who stole the water.

To reiterate, the case of the man who stole the water is not comparable. He pleaded guilty, was sentenced by magistrates and is now serving a prison sentence. You don't grant bail after someone has been given a prison sentence!

&gt; One of the accused was a 16-year-old youth with eight previous convictions; another, 21-year-old Marouane Rouhi, is a second-year law student, the judge was told, who vehemently denied knowing any of the others or having been involved. Like his co-accused, he was denied bail.

&gt; Student, no previous, denies wrongdoing - no bail

Again, not comparable. Rouhi and the others were accused of a considerably more serious, violent crime. You highlight the fact he is a university student, but that may have actually counted *against* his likelihood of being granted bail, as he will likely move between addresses throughout the year.

&gt; I could go on but perhaps you should read up Instead of me spoon feeding you.

I'd be interested if you could find a number of cases in which someone was charged with a non-violent crime, pleaded not guilty, applied for bail and was refused.

Only if you can place the Johnson case alongside a number of similar such cases, would it be remarkable.",0,1313190667,null,0,false,0,c2c2vl2,t3_jgq2u,t1_c2c2vl2,t1_c2c0jnf,1427464931,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

The Silents are working some kind of hidden mission. A Silent gave the message to the warden in secret, but ANOTHER Silent wanted to make itself known.

Maybe there are two lots of Silents. One in the alternative dimension (in control of Earth) and enemies of the Doctor, and one on the normal reality, which actually wants to help the Doctor, and that is the one who warned Amy about her pregnancy.

true,JB_UK,null,null,"Incidentally, when they trade statistics- black people being thirty times more likely to be stopped and searched vs. 80% of gun crime being black- they are both wrong. I was looking at this the other day, and now excuse me while I go into detail, because I think it's interesting and relevant to the riots. 

Firstly, gun, knife and street crime statistics can be found [in this Telegraph article](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/crime/7856787/Violent-inner-city-crime-the-figures-and-a-question-of-race.html), with the data coming from the government. To quote directly, ""of those proceeded against for street crimes [in London], 54 per cent were black; for robbery, 59 per cent; and for gun crimes, 67 per cent.""

Secondly, the stop and search figure comes from [this somewhat misleading Guardian article](http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2010/oct/17/stop-and-search-race-figures). There are [a surprising number of pieces of legislation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stop_and_search#Search_without_arrest) which allow the police to stop and search. That article refers to searches made using one of these bits of legislation, Section 60 of the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994, which allows a senior police officer to set up a temporary area within which they can search anyone they wish without needing an excuse. However, the majority of searches occur under Section 1 of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984, which requires reasonable suspicion that something illegal will be found.

Black people are actually [about 7x more likely to be stopped](http://www.guardian.co.uk/law/2010/jun/17/stop-and-search-police) and searched (or slightly more, because that article only seems to take account of section 1). That is then mitigated by the fact that the MET uses stop-and-search a lot more than other police forces, and black people are disproportionately represented in London as compared to the UK as a whole, and are then undoubtedly more likely to live in high-crime areas within London. There is also the apparent fact that black people are statistically more likely to commit the various types of crimes relevant to street searches (at least if you assume you can correlate people being prosecuted with being guilty of the crime; it could be true that the police and CPS are so institutionally racist that they arrest and prosecute innocent black people in such numbers to skew the figures, but it seems unlikely). So there is some difference there, but it's not so disgraceful as is suggested.

The other interesting issue is that section 60 gives police more discretion- senior police officers choose where section 60 applies, and street-level officers can choose who to search without restriction- but as they are given this discretion they seem to use it to focus more on black people, which is perhaps not a positive indicator of attitudes at all levels within the police. 

Another point is it may be the case that some local areas are repeatedly put under section 60, and so there may be black people living in those areas who are searched very frequently, which would be an obvious starting point for conflict and rioting. I wonder how often section 60 areas have been set up in Tottenham.

2) Silva, Yaya, and Hart are key players who MUST stay healthy for us.  I think both AJ and Kun will have a good year.  One of Balotelli/Dzeko will have to step up and provide goals.

3) United of course.  Other than that, Everton, and all those mid-table teams who we can't seem to get 3 points from.

4) Right now I want Nasri and/or Sneidjer to help with creativity.  I'd prefer we keep SWP.  I think he can still be an effective wing, and provide good service to Dzeko and Balo.

but yeah good point about those things, i often forget the north is so fucking horrible by comparison - glad as fuck my family were taken to the coal mines rather than the works towns :)  but we came back east a few generations ago because the only kind of work up there was slavery, my genetic line came this side of the south of the country for the exact same reason the other strand of genetics was here - London the employment capital of England!  Like most people of the era both strands migrated through the east end before washing out into working class essex, pretty much everyone here is now a former eastender with the natural population mostly displaced to the south of spain.  
  
The mayfair set and various groups of official suited types drifted west to fill surry and hampshire, working class satalite towns like reading begin the slow process of gentrification and apartheid.  Hugely complex ecosystems of history and meme develops and grows and areas develop character and stereotypes; needless to say working class essex doesn't come off too well in the national eye.  Everyone down here knows we're not welcome in the north, we know it's worse than here and all the jobs and shit and the weathers even worse.  
  
Way out west is not better job wise, there's some work occasionally and the people are friendly but if you go out there you end up in bristol or somewhere with just as much of poverty trap.  So you're stuck in whatever little pool of london you've found yourself in and you can almost make ends meet. it's a constant struggle but it seems like you might make it if you keep trying but you never do and you push harder, harder, you're never quiet there and then at some point someone will just come and kick everything you've been working for to pieces for nothing.  
  
Rather than give up everything and risk a life of destitution people live a constant battle of making ends meet, i'd love to retrain and get a more sensible job but i can't afford to live unless i work all the work i can get - i've got a few projects going on but everything ends up costing money i dont have and being more of a ballache than it ever should be, almost uniformly for reasons out of my control.

Rodney is another character who tries to follow middle class values

to what the solution is - it points to the time in the 80s where people
had a choice of social mobility - owning their own home and 
going to University and starting on the first step of becoming middle
class.

This was an option available to many more people compared to the
'rag to riches' stories that rappers often have, if 1% are successful
from the means promoted ... what happens to the fall out?

But Starkey was a fool to blame ""black culture"" or black people
when in the last decade all most all media has become pornographic
and this is especially true of the upper middle class dramas and
movies that America exports to the UK.

So much American culture has influenced the UK that UK identity

However, we don't have sufficient evidence to say one way or another. So if we are to adequately judge the reliability of the IPCC's statements, maybe we should stick to claims for which evidence are available. All the publicly-available press-releases from the IPCC are accurate and not misleading. If anything, this is further evidence that quotes in news articles should not be readily accepted as fact, either because the source may not take responsibility for it, or because it may be a misquote.

In 10/11 there were 14,000 more tax payers paying in the 150k+ bracket, but in total earnings they earn around £1 billion less. This could suggest some loss of income due to avoidance/evasion.

However, when you look at the total tax takes for the 09/10 years and the 10/11, compared with the amount of money they were taxed upon. Additionally discounting an extra £2 billion due to the removal of the personal allowance which happened on the same year.

Furthermore, the let's not pretend this person was a little angel beforehand - he's probably been tearing up the neighbourhood for a long time - and the local council housing rep now finally has an excuse to get rid of him.

And I support the community's right to remove people like this. Council estates are not nice places to live because they contain some undesirable people - the vast majority of the people are actually normal, compassionate, moral people. And it is these people who ruin the place for everyone - without them the community will improve and so will social mobility, wealth and achievement in the area.

What about the people who were evicted? What will they do? Well maybe they will consider how their behaviour effects others - something they have probably never done before. And what's more we should be asking: What about the innocent person lives next door to these people?

I want them to believe with all the piety a Franciscan nun shows her god that rioting is wrong.  In this sense I feel 6 months will be seen only as a punishment. 

I might be in the minority but I think someone who was at the riots and undertook, or can be shown to have encouraged, any criminal activity should immediately be looking at 2 years, with room to manoeuvre during the sentence to accommodate progress.

'Stole £3.50 of water' - which means he was at the riot, he walked up to a shop being ransacked, he walked into the shop, he took something that was not his and walked back out.  It's not even a spur of the moment  with something falling at his feet and in a second of madness he takes it when he thinks no-one is looking.  He sees a Lidl being looted and he walks into it.  If he'd have been a minor I'd have suggested the Social Services looked into his family with a view to possibly putting all younger siblings into care.

Don't want to become middle-class (have money) isn't that what the problem is, they want what they've got?
Think the state looking after people is bad but it should give them more free stuff.
My council has one of your art projects, the kids sit outside getting drunk abusing the shoppers. It has a shop teaching retail skills (I used to work there) to those on benefits half of them bugger off because they have no work ethic and can't be bothered. A lot are forced on to these course, don't go we stop your dole.
Being on benefits is to easy, everything is done for you, it makes you lazy and bored (and yes I have been on benefits and know exactly what it's like), and unless something gives you a kick up the arse you pass that attitude on to your kids, then you get this something for nothing society we've got now.

I'd argue we should spend more money on policing tax evasion/avoidance. There's a commonly cited figure that you get a three for one return on money spend enforcing tax laws, though I don't know the source to back that one up.

But given that the HMRC let Vodafone off a minimum of £1billion taxes which they had already set asign, and additionally let them off another £1/2 billion of interest on the taxes that they did finally pay. Combined with the fact that the government is cutting HMRC's budget by £1.6bn, (that's 25% of total budget), and that HMRC's budget has been cut in real-terms every year since its formation.

To me it's clear that the government's agenda is not maximising tax revenue as they are trying to frame the 50p cut, but instead it's minimising what their rich buddies have to pay.

Parental upbringing is only one factor in a plethora of reasons as to why someone acts like they do, and it has a varied weighting regarding this which is dependant upon the individual personality of a child. A rebellious child with the worlds best parents could be out there smashing shit up - there isn't anything more the parents could do.

We could go punish parents and families for it, but frankly I think it's wrong. Some people with some of the worst upbringings get the difference between right and wrong and act in accordance with the law. I don't get why this example is ignored but as soon as the inverse is true, it's the parents fault and they need to be harsher on their kids. You acknowledge in your last paragraph that the individual themselves made the choices, but if they had made the same choices whilst younger, then it's his parents fault? I disagree and think that, within acceptable boundaries, if someone is old enough to contemplate committing a crime knowing full well the consequences, they should receive the punishment, not the parents.

That being said, I do think the culture we've developed of 'just say no' to misbehaving children certainly does not help, we're teaching children that harsh words are all they get if they misbehave. It reinforces the lack of a concrete punishment for misbehaving.

true,theHM,null,null,"&gt; I would rather they wait until the facts are established and avoid fueling speculation by indulging in it themselves

We don't know for sure that they did. The publicly-available press-releases  are all accurate and not misleading. Maybe, in situations like this, it would be appropriate for them not to provide information via private correspondence, thus ensuring that everyone has access to the same information, and there is reliable record of what is stated.

&gt; But, truly, if they can’t be certain what statements they have and have not made, they can hardly claim competence in overseeing the police.

I disagree entirely. They have shown that they will obtain whatever evidence is available, examine it without prejudice, and publish whatever accurate findings can be made. This is exactly what they are supposed to do.

&gt; but they don’t quite know what they’re saying? Really? I’m looking for the '/s' tag, but I can’t see it.

The only way they could know for certain what information was relayed to the journalists is if they had a third part taking dictation, or a recording of each and every call.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt;There has to be a point where you have to acknowledge that the parents responsibilities for a childs actions has to stop. 

There is and it is 16.  At 16 a child leaves school and it is largely then up to them where they go be it further education or looking for employment.  At this stage they are responsible for their peer groups.  Up until that point the parent/s are responsible and in total control, no matter what excuses people try to make in their defence.

&gt;A rebellious child with the worlds best parents could be out there smashing shit up - there isn't anything more the parents could do.

Absolutely and demonstratively wrong.  A good parent can remove them from that environment altogether.  The best parents regularly move their entire lives to get their child into a good school.  Not even the best parent, a middle of the road good parent would move if their child began coming home from school speaking creole.  It is as simple as this, they won't be employable - not in any meaningful way in which one would hope for their children.

&gt;We could go punish parents and families for it, but frankly I think it's wrong. 

When I suggested Social Services looking at these families with a view to possibly putting younger siblings into care it's not to punish the parent but to save the child.  Just because somebody has a womb doesn't give them a right to abuse a child, and failing to raise a child with certain social skills and expectations is abuse.

As far as taking a home of someone I'd leave that entirely up to the council. I can well understand however them looking at a long list of people waiting to get accommodation, decent law abiding people, then looking at some problematic residents, then looking at the council lease, and then coming to the conclusion that they'll give someone else the limited opportunity.  You see it as punishment, I see it as someone else's reward.  Essentially it's still remains up to the council.

&gt;You acknowledge in your last paragraph that the individual themselves made the choices, but if they had made the same choices whilst younger, then it's his parents fault? 

Clearly yes.  We don't hold children as accountable as adults for obvious reasons.

&gt; I was under the impression that we handed out punishments based on the individual committing the crime, not on how we can cause the most damage to the individual committing it.

Clearly nobody is talking about causing 'most damage'.",0,1313248531,null,0,false,0,c2c749m,t3_jhn6e,t1_c2c749m,t1_c2c70mc,1427466927,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

1) 4-4-2 doesn't work for Liverpool, at least not with Lucas, whom I love, but he's not a 4-4-2 midfielder. Our midfield was getting overrun today, and it's certainly not going to be any different vs Arsenal if we play the same tactics. 

2) I would really prefer to try Kuyt instead of Carroll up front. His acceleration is faster, he drops back and works harder which improves our midfield, and he can play better with the ball at his feet. And he seems to link up nicely with Suarez and complements him, really. 

3) Flanagan made some pretty bad mistakes, but hopefully that doesn't get to him and he'll learn from it because we'll need him again this season. 

4) Henderson was invisible. Downing was very good, so was Adam. Enrique was very subdued and kept back, but that's probably because there's direct orders from Dalglish to do so until he learns how our back line works.

Oborne begins by stating that:

&gt; I’d guess that few of them bother to pay British tax if they can avoid it, and that fewer still feel the sense of obligation to society that only a few decades ago came naturally to the wealthy and better off.

How is this any less outrageous than someone from a higher income bracket making the same statement about those on benefits? It's a sweeping generalisation that doesn't even attempt to cement itself in fact - and yet Oborne uses the statement to launch his attack.

Repeatedly, he seems to gloss over the main distinction separating the looters from the 'criminals' in Parliament: what the MPs did in the expenses scandal, in the whole, was morally unacceptable but legally above board. **Prison sentences were handed out to, for example, Lord Hanningfield, where evidence of illegal activity was sufficient**. There is an additional perspective to this:

&gt; A great deal has been made over the past few days of the greed of the rioters for consumer goods, not least by Rotherham MP Denis MacShane who accurately remarked, “What the looters wanted was for a few minutes to enter the world of Sloane Street consumption.” This from a man who notoriously claimed £5,900 for eight laptops. Of course, as an MP he obtained these laptops legally through his expenses.

The laptops, to use Oborne's example, whilst obtained in morally murky circumstances, *were paid for*. A shop, retailing these items, was legitimately paid perfectly good money for them, and so was able to continue paying staff, and paying taxes. The same can hardly be said for the looters - and that, I would argue, is an important distinction when weighing the two.

Time after time, the line is blurred between law and morality in that article - yet, for the rioters, both law **and** morality was breached. Tax loopholes and bonuses are indeed in conflict with most people's morality - but they are not illegal. In the expenses scandal, where solid evidence of illegal activity was uncovered, those members were investigated by the Police - as was right.

Or maybe you're talking about some other run. He made several of those. In the case of some he lost the ball - as did Downing or Suarez today, and as will any footballer. In the case of others, he did manage a good pass or cross, only for it to come to nothing for one reason or another.

true,Axius,uk,United Kingdom,"I don't mean legally, I mean mentally. We're saying '16, any younger and their actions are your responsibility', which in itself is punishing parents who have children who don't want to do what they're told. Just saying 'it's meant to be' doesn't mean it is so. Children at 16 don't gain a moral compass and know what's right or wrong, nor do they suddenly change. 

There are things that the parents should be considered for, but what you're suggesting is that if a parent says to their child ""You're staying in tonight, you're not getting in any trouble"", that if the child says ""Fuck you, I'm doing what I want"" and walks out the door, that the parent is responsible for everything. What are they meant to do in that sort of situation?

Parents cannot have absolute control over every element of their childs life, and I would imagine the desire to rebel can be made a lot worse in that situation. I've read things in the past about the impact moving around and relocating a child can have on them and their development, and that isn't quite a desirable outcome. You cannot begin to assess parents on a qualitative level based on the behaviour of their children - life circumstance and available resources factor into everything. Parenting is not assessed on whether their child will be employable or not.

As for social skills and expectations - You have to accept that even you as an individual will find particular expectations or desired attributes just simply do not feel right for you and as a result will make no attempt to take them on board, deeming them incorrect. Children are just as much people as those older - they are capable of making such decisions and there isn't a real lot you can do about it. 

I believe that while there are obvious reasons we don't hold children as accountable as adults, passing the punishment on to the parents may not always be quite as effective as it seems. Prison sentences and whatnot for children is obviously quite extreme, but instead of passing punishments on to parents, they should instead consider ways of teaching children that there are consequences for themselves for committing these acts rather than ""Your father's off to prison for 6 months for what you did"".

As for nobody talking about causing the most damage, people aren't being that explicit about it, but the sentiment is there. People want the rioters to feel the worst punishment possible for what they've done because it makes them feel they will be dissuaded from doing it again.

Yes, I hold an 'anti-rioter stance' (i.e. I believe the violence and disorder was inexcusable, and those responsible should be punished to the full extent of the law). That is neither a controversial nor an unpopular view. It is the view shared by the leaders of all three major political parties, the police, and in my experience, the overwhelming majority of the public.

&gt; You seem quite happy for the full weight of the law to be used against black people or other minorities but a rich white girl all of a sudden gets the benefit if the doubt

I don't know what on earth you're attempting to infer here. If it's that I'm a racist, you couldn't be further from the truth. I am quite happy for the full weight of the law to be used against *all* involved in the disorder. That is, those that have been *convicted* of crimes. The man who stole water has been *convicted* of the theft. Throw the book at him. If Laura Johnson is convicted of a crime, I would also advocate throwing the book at her.

What you are conveniently overlooking is that Laura Johnson has *not* been convicted of any crime *yet*. So for the moment we allow due process. In this particular case, that due process is having the case referred to the Crown Court (as she has pleaded not guilty in the magistrates' court). She has been given a court date in five weeks time. Due you *really* think it is appropriate to remand her in custody (bearing in mind she has not been convicted of any crime) for **five weeks** (i.e. longer than many of the prison sentences being handed out to those who *have* been convicted of crimes) while she awaits that appearance? **Five weeks in custody for someone who hasn't been convicted of any crime and may not be? Are you fucking mental?**

&gt; the police get the benefit of the doubt when they shoot a black man but all those black people arrested should be jailed. That seems to be your stance.

It's not a matter of giving police the 'benefit of the doubt'. It's a case of going on the evidence that is available. As it stands, there is no evidence, and no reason to suspect, that the shooting of Mark Duggan was unlawful. The matter is the subject of an ongoing investigation by the IPCC. Those using the, potentially entirely lawful, shooting of Duggan as an excuse to commit disorder are jumping the gun.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt;I don't mean legally, I mean mentally. We're saying '16, any younger and their actions are your responsibility', which in itself is punishing parents who have children who don't want to do what they're told.

If you've got a kid like that you've done something wrong when they were 12, 13, 14.

&gt;What are they meant to do in that sort of situation?

Literally stand in their way.
  
&gt;Parents cannot have absolute control over every element of their childs life, and I would imagine the desire to rebel can be made a lot worse in that situation.

They can have a hell of a lot.  They can choose school, funds, time spent socialising, where they socialise and hold a nuke button on an entire circle of friends.

&gt;I've read things in the past about the impact moving around and relocating a child can have on them and their development, and that isn't quite a desirable outcome. 

Oh, come on! You can't possibly argue moving away from a bad area as being more damaging to a child.  You're arguing for the sake of arguing.

&gt; You cannot begin to assess parents on a qualitative level based on the behaviour of their children - life circumstance and available resources factor into everything. 

So factor them in.    But in context to what I was saying I said assess the parents on their ability to parent...and yes, I'd be looking at older siblings as an indicator of whether a smaller child needs protection from bad parenting.

&gt;Parenting is not assessed on whether their child will be employable or not.

It's a major part of it.  Parenting is about raising a responsible person.  In context I said not even the best parent in the world, just an everyday competent one would snap down immediately if their child began speaking creole or hanging around in the wrong circles.  You just don't let it happen.

&gt;Children are just as much people as those older - they are capable of making such decisions and there isn't a real lot you can do about it.

Strange how the vast majority of parents manage to do just that.  Children are people and that means they are extremely susceptible to conditioning.  Good parents begin positively conditioning their children before they can even speak.

&gt;""Your father's off to prison for 6 months for what you did"".

Who's saying that?

&gt;As for nobody talking about causing the most damage, people aren't being that explicit about it, but the sentiment is there. 

No it's not.  There's a sentiment of holding accountable to the full legal extent.  That is not mean 'most damage'.

&gt;People want the rioters to feel the worst punishment possible for what they've done because it makes them feel they will be dissuaded from doing it again.

That again does not mean 'most damage'.  If anything the implication is 'most productive' cure.",0,1313253764,null,0,false,0,c2c7kjj,t3_jhn6e,t1_c2c7kjj,t1_c2c7fz5,1427467141,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

&gt; So to cut total crime figures, longer prison sentences would work.

Longer sentences would have a slight reduction in the amount of time a person is in a position to cause a crime (75 years of opportunity and you're talking about a few months here or there, unless we go Saudi Arabia and decide to be completely uncivilised) while dramatically increasing the likelihood that this person will want to commit a crime in the time they have.

OTOH a system like Norway's is far softer than ours and does so much better than ours in actual facts on the ground that comparison isn't even sensible. Norway has a system that can reasonably be said to be doing a good job. We do not. Countries like the US who implement your style of justice are even worse than us. Moving away from a system that works towards one that doesn't is not sensible.

You would need to add decades in order to actually have a reasonable impact.

The Law Commission researched the various urban myths about strange laws supposedly still on the books, and found that:

&gt; There is no generally applicable offence of urinating in public. There was an attempt to insert an amendment into the Criminal and Justice Police Act 2001 to create a specific offence but the amendment was rejected; Lord Bassam of Brighton Hansard (HL) April 30 2001, vol 625, col 488. However the offence is regulated by local bye-laws: Home Office Model Byelaws Bye-law No 24: no person shall urinate or defecate in any public place. There does not appear to be an exemption for pregnant women.

&gt; Although discretion not to charge might be exercised if a pregnant woman were caught short in public, it does seem unlikely that a police officer would offer his helmet for the purpose.

true,ivaat,null,null,"&gt;Lucas' job is to sit just infront of the back two and give them protection, so I don't think he can be blamed for the lack of attacking intent today.

Not in the case of 4-4-2 it isn't his job, or shouldn't be at least. Being a defensively solid midfielder in 4-4-2 just isn't good enough was my point. In the case of 4-5-1, sure, or even in the case of the ""diamond"" 4-4-2. But that's not how we played. So when we're not playing 4-5-1, I do think that we'll need Lucas to venture forward more often; we'd need the midfielders to be more ""complete players"" like Mereiles or Gerrard. 

&gt;Also, I think Enrique did pretty well linking up with Downing and Suarez down the left side. He might not have had any shots, but I think he did a great job defensively, which makes up for that.

Yeah, Enrique clearly didn't either feel comfortable getting forward or was under direct orders not to, and fair enough really, he joined the team only yesterday. But my point was rather that if you make a run forward, and you only have 2-3 teammates up front, all easily picked up by the 5-6 defenders, then what are you going to do? You try to go through a few defenders or try a risky pass, and make something happen. Or you can not try at all and pass it backwards and let someone else think of something, or hoof it forward. Personally I'm happy that Adam had the courage and confidence to try the penetrating runs, and once the rest of the team gets the confidence to commit bodies forward (as always Blackpool did) I think this sort of runs can turn a lot more fruitful.

Nope, it's entirely factual, as I previously explained. It's a fact that they can't be sure they didn't provide a misleading quote. Being uncertain is not being factual.

&gt; We do have their word for it.

No, they have stated they might have said something misleading in that it's possible one of their representatives said something incorrect and can't recall precisely what they said. If anything this is an indictment of the journalist's lack of integrity for not double-checking a critical point they wished to write. You may consider this to be *""[not] in command of what they say""*, but in terms of organisations with multiple representatives and many releases per day, I'd reserve such a assertion for when representatives routinely provide inaccurate information, rather than a possible one-off incident.

In the absence of further evidence, the IPCC is doing the responsible thing by reiterating what is known about the Duggan shooting, and stating it is possible they provided misleading information, as the alternative is to accuse journalists of misquoting them, which would only hamper their attempts to disseminate information.

When senior players get hurt or leave, younger players should get a run in the games. Flanagan was a non-risk today, solid defense, the offense of the attacking team should have been more restrained by our midfield but that lacked. I would have liked it if kuyt was put infront of flanagan to develop him while at the same time acting as cover. But he will never develop if we only think of using him when other players are injured, but never expect him to make mistakes. Let him make mistakes, then run and train harder on the next session, at least he knows he has a fighting chance.

I would like to see flanagan and robinson as #2 options, obviously aurelio needs to play when we play big teams and enrique is injured, same for kelly when g.johnson is injured. They are very young, but they show promise that we haven't had in some of our senior players for a while, and I would hate it if we become a team that has too many good players to not give chance to young players. They saved our season when we lost our fullbacks, it says more about their abillity than one bad match, in which several players had good and bad half.

Against arsenal I don't expect henderson to start, nor flanagan, but I'm fine with KK taking chances if the risk is relatively low.",0,1313269976,null,0,false,0,c2c97um,t3_jhts9,t1_c2c97um,t1_c2c8hb1,1427467985,2,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,2

Courts work by proving beyond reasonable doubt.

Manufacturing here still remains steady, having not fallen at all over the past recession and giving us control of corporation tax would encourage further growth. Go talk to Dupont, Bombardier, Seagate etc and tell them that they're mad.

Admittedly, we do have a lumbering public sector, hence why I said a united Ireland would be disastrous. ROI could simply not support us. As I said, further devolution on economic matters while maintaining links with both Britain and Eire is the way forward. I didn't mean independent when I said self governed.

Regardless, we live in a country where you can be either Irish or British or both. The only gain from a single government united Ireland is just the fact that we can say Ireland is united, that's it. Is that worth potentially setting off another decade of fighting? The best compromise is self governance while maintaining strong links to both the UK and Eire.

Nobody proved anything.  He pleaded guilty to a specific crime of stealing some water.

&gt; The police used to convict Mafia bosses in similar ways. Everyone knew these people were responsible for mass murders and drug trafficking but couldn't pin any of it on them. And the eventually they get caught speeding 30mph over the limit and by some quirk of the law the maximum prison sentence is 20 years? Guess what they get? 20 years.

That sounds like a pretty good justification to riot.  If penalties are affected by what other crimes people *might* have been doing, why have this silly proving thing at all?

&gt; That's the exact attitude which is causing the problem with youth culture. Too soft.

The ""problems"" with youth culture are caused by a number of factors.  Some guy who committed a really trivial crime is not an example of these problems.  It's the people who broke into the place in the first place, and the people who started the riots.

When an individual crosses his or her own timeline and meets him or herself, there's a kind of potential energy differential between them that causes a huge energy discharge if they make physical contact.  It's not entirely unlike touching someone and getting a jolt of static electricity, but much more devastating.  This effect is a major plot point in the episode ""Mawdryn Undead"" where [the Brigadier is physically and psychologically traumatized by contact with his older self](/spoiler).

This concept comes across in ""The Big Bang"" when the Doctor touches the two sonic screwdrivers and sparks shoot between them.  At that point, the time-space continuum itself is *much much smaller* than it should be, so the potential energy differential between the two versions of the object isn't as big as it would be normally.  Same with Amy and Amelia.  

The Doctor is an unusual case in that he's often met himself at other points in his timestream; we can assume either Time Lords are immune to the effect, or the TARDIS has some way of dispelling the built-up energy.  That would probably explain the ""Christmas Carol"" issue as well.

When the politicans appropriate money for their own uses, it's like dipping into the charity box.

When the bankers pass off unsound investments as being valuable, it's like selling a dodgy car for more than it's worth by turning back the mileometer and applying cheap and nasty fixes to make it look it's in good nick.

When the media outlets hack phones, it's like the paps climbing a ladder and putting their ear against your bedroom window. The bribery doesn't need similies when it has enough different instances (corruption).

When disillusioned and vengeful youth riot on the streets, it's violent, assault on other people (even manslaughter) and in the case of the people whose homes and businesses were attacked it causes mental anguish.

This argument about using a gun for home defence is a stupid one, because if someone's just coming to take stuff from you, just stay out of their way and you won't get harmed. If you decide to ""defend"" your meaningless, replaceable possessions with a gun, then you can reasonably assume the other party is armed as well, meaning you're just as likely to die. You have got to be utterly insane to want guns in such an argument.

Secondly, if an unarmed person were to take your laptop, is that really a justifiable means to kill them? It wouldn't be on the street, so why should it be in your home? And please don't say ""It's because it is my home!"". You can't rule on killing somebody based solely on the location.

Thirdly, if an unarmed person were to come into your home, you shot them, they died. You would have to argue they were in the process of robbing you, wouldn't you? What if you had left the front door open and it was an off-duty police officer making sure the house wasn't being burgled? Most people would just shoot, then ask questions later, leaving innocent people dying.

Then if the public had guns, all Police would have to routinely carry guns. Do you trust ALL Police enough to carry them?

true,lookatmythingy,null,null,"Well all that would tell you is whether the crime figures at the event were up or down on the previous year.

In order to determine whether the carnival itself led to a greater level of crime to the baseline, you'd need to compare it to a similar control population.

The carnival typically attracts around 1 million people over the course of two days; and so what we want to know is whether an equivalent 1 million people (and a population who are out on the street, rather than safely ensconced at home) over the same period would produce a greater or lesser rate of crime.

The current crime stats for London as reported to the Met Police equate to around 2,350 crimes per day for a population of 7 million. This would be equivalent to 670 crimes for the carnival population over the two days of the carnival.

However, only a fraction of the people creating the stats for the city as a whole will be out on the street at any given time - so an equivalent population for comparison might actually be say twice the size, meaning that the expected number of crimes for the festival would be 1,340.

In addition, the demographics of the carnival population are likely different to the general population - specifically a smaller percentage of babies and old people - and so we might want to increase that estimate again; another 30% would make it around 1,800.

If this were an accurate estimation, then what we'd want to know is whether there were greater or fewer than 1,800 reported crimes during the carnival. If it was about the same amount, then we would conclude that the carnival did not lead to an increase in crime.

Obviously in actuality it is much, much more complicated than this; we'd need to take into account the density of the population on the street (greater density expected to increase crime levels), more detailed demographic analysis, incidences of specific types of crime, flow of people in and out of the carnival area, police numbers and concentration, etc., etc.

To cut a potentially incredibly long response short; it's very complicated, but a statistic arising from the carnival that said, for example, that 400 muggings and ten stabbings had occurred is meaningless without proper comparison to an equivalent non-festival population - but could in fact be no different to, or even better than the average for the same population in non-carnival conditions.

There's a classic rejoinder too - this music chronicles a way of life, enacts it, talks through it - more than it glorifies it. The music is always so much more complicated than simple advocacy or condemnation for a way of life. 

Music's influence on the listener is also complex and sophisticated. Music can bring on certain moods, as we know, but this can be voluntary as well as involuntary. Most people today will listen to a vast range of music, thanks to the internet, and I don't think you could be savvy enough to follow grime artists on soundcloud etc without also being in touch with all the other genres. You'd have control over your playlists, you wouldn't be locked into the harder sounds and more aggressive lyrics unless you wanted to be in the first place.

true,beckse,tardis,TARDIS,"I wouldn't skip Boomtown in Season 1 because that is the first time ""Bad Wolf"" is acknowledged by the Doctor &amp; Rose which is important for the first season story arc.

Season 1: ""Father's Day"" I didn't see this one the first time round (the others I was watching with did) and when I watched it later I just didn't enjoy or like the writing of the episode. The time paradox thing never comes up again and these rules get broken all the time and the Doctor's relationship towards humans is off (calling Rose a ""stupid ape"" etc). 

Season 2: ""Love &amp; Monsters"" &amp; ""Fear Her""  

Season 3: Really I'd watch them all. The story arc is pretty tight if subtle through out. The Dalek two parter could be cut but then you'd just be confused for the season 4 finale. 

Season 4: You could probably cut ""Midnight"" since it stands alone so much, but it is a really good episode. 

Season 5: Okay with Moffett I wouldn't want to cut anything. Mostly because things that at first don't seem that big of a deal (The Lodger) come back and are pretty huge. 

Season 6: so far the The Curse of the Black Spot could be cut, but once again I don't know if that'll come back and bite you (They do pop up again and it might be confusing...)

Put my personal opinion? If you want to watch series 6 together I'd just have them watch series 5 and the first half of 6. It is a good place to start without knowing the backstory. Then after series 6 is over you all can go back and watch the previous 4 series and the specials.

Midnight. I love it because it's so psychological. It has one of the scariest bad guys (in my opinion) because you never actually see it and the way it manipulates the other passengers is fascinating. I thought it was a pretty accurate example of what a situation like that could turn into, and it's one of the few times we see the Doctor look genuinely scared for his life.

Less serious, The Lodger. I just really love this story. It's cute, funny, and heart-warming. And the Doctor plays football.

And as to looting bookstores: it's pointless these days (or has less point to it than looting jeans), because there are public libraries, second-hand bookstores and the internet (full of books both public domain and pirated).

&gt;If they (the press) are informed by one representative of a crucial piece of information that isn't anywhere in the official releases, it is the journalists responsibility to make sure that that piece of information is accurate.

It absolutely is not. If a journalist is researching or investigating a story, then each and every material fact needs a minimum of 2 independent and reliable sources. If they are being *told* something by a press  officer, then the press officer’s comment *is* the story. If newspapers, like those you cite, started independently researching claims made by the IPCC, and then publishing their conclusions alongside the IPCC’s statements and reports, I have a strong hunch that you would be vigorous in attacking them for it. They didn’t and they were right not to.

The back and forth get away was amusing, as was her expression during the breath spray, and the whole exchange where she lays different traps for the Doctor at dinner, all avoided. 

The episode also actually made a previously annoying monster sympathetic, partly because of grief over the loss of the other slitheen, and also for [her desire to change, which, although doubtful at first, was somewhat proven at the end by the TARDIS' granting her wish.

""Could a man identify a product purely by reading its barcode? Could a mobility scooter hit 70mph? Is it possible to kick yourself in the head more than 60 times in a minute? And, most importantly of all, is there someone in this country who can identify any type of fish, simply by being slapped round the face by it?

Epic Win is a brand-new entertainment series which attempts to answer these burning questions, as host Alexander Armstrong welcomes ordinary individuals to put these extraordinary abilities to the test.

As well as taking on their personal challenge, each contestant also faces the Epic panel, headed by comedian Micky Flanagan, with two weekly special guests. If the contestants succeed in their challenge, the panel will put a secret monetary value on their skills of up to £1,000 each, giving a potential grand prize of £3,000 – although this amount is not revealed at this point.

The contender now faces the increasing totaliser machine. They are presented with a succession of increasing random amounts of cash. They choose when to stop the totaliser at the amount which they believe the panellists have valued them at. Will they guess correctly and walk away with an epic cash prize, or will they get greedy and end up with nothing, leaving through the ""Epic Fail"" door?

Joining Alexander and Micky is comedian Joe Lycett, who lends his totally epic voice as the on-screen announcer.""

Seccond lets say you DO have time to get a quick phone call off... Then what? Even if they have a response time of 3 minutes thats still 3 minutes of you vs the intruder/attacker.

Your seccond arguement about an unarmed burgular I admit is right but only in that specific scenario, every other scenario on the other hand where the burgular IS armed or plans to do more than just steal your things then it becomes invalid. Fact is this person is breaking into your home in order to steal things from you and the fact that you're in to witness it/defend against it proves that they're iether really stupid or they already knew you were in and decided to go in anyways... Either way thats a big NO NO.

Your next arguement about the police routinely carrying guns is something that i've been in favour of for many years and whilst we could have a long debate on the benefits vs cons of the police having guns this is more about the civillian side of things so I'll stick to that for now...

Your final arguement of ""yes it's bad lets not make it any worse"" is a cop out, you're basically admitting that yes people get shot by illegal firearms carried by somebody who is clearly NOT a law abiding citizen and saying ""oh well at least there aren't MORE guns on the street because that would be awful!"" whilst metaphorically walking past their dead body without a care in the world.

true,ezekielziggy,eng-sussex,Sussex,"Ah no worries, I feel the same way. Just a quick google search and I found one semi relevant quote from kubrick that I rather liked.

Playboy: If life is so purposeless, do you feel its worth living? 

Kubrick: Yes, for those who manage somehow to cope with our mortality. The very meaninglessness of life forces a man to create his own meaning. Children, of course, begin life with an untarnished sense of wonder, a capacity to experience total joy at something as simple as the greenness of a leaf; but as they grow older, the awareness of death and decay begins to impinge on their consciousness and subtly erode their joie de vivre (a keen enjoyment of living), their idealism - and their assumption of immortality. 

As a child matures, he sees death and pain everywhere about him, and begins to lose faith in the ultimate goodness of man. But if he’s reasonably strong - and lucky - he can emerge from this twilight of the soul into a rebirth of life’s élan (enthusiastic and assured vigour and liveliness). 

Both because of and in spite of his awareness of the meaninglessness of life, he can forge a fresh sense of purpose and affirmation. He may not recapture the same pure sense of wonder he was born with, but he can shape something far more enduring and sustaining. 

The most terrifying fact about the universe is not that it is hostile but that it is indifferent; but if we can come to terms with this indifference and accept the challenges of life within the boundaries of death - however mutable man may be able to make them - our existence as a species can have genuine meaning and fulfilment. However vast the darkness, we must supply our own light.”

Our Public Sector is effective, educated and well run. It's easy to demonize it, despite the fact it's been under almost constant scrutiny from the UK Taxpayer since the 80's. Nationalism/Unionism doesn't seem as important when factored in with flexi-time. Almost all the armchair republicans or loyalists I know work for the CS -- hence their chat remains just that. Chat.

Nice call to arms in your last paragraph there. I'm not proud to be associated with the self-serving sycophants in Stormont. Are you? I also don't believe if Stormont were to fail that it would set off another 'decade of fighting'. The Diplomatic Leaks c.o. Wikileaks revealed that while the first Stormont experiment was taking place between the SDLP and UUP, DUP and SF were being groomed for Government.

I think this is a clue that Rory was in the Auton body in ""The Eleventh Hour"" and remained so throughout Series 5 until he was ""killed"" by the Silurian and is erased from the time stream in ""Cold Blood"". If we take the issue date as not being some kind of mistake on the producer's part, (why would we even see this if it weren't a plot point) this means that Rory would be at least 38 to 40 years old in 2010.  Simply, Rory didn't age over a 20 year period. 

Did the Pandorica exist at the time of ""Eleventh Hour""?  If it did, then so did Auton Rory Williams.

On negative influence, do you think it makes no difference what culture someone is brought up in? Many asylum seekers by definition come to Britain from troubled backgrounds, where education is limited, violence is commonplace and the rule of law does not exist, let alone religious tolerance or democratic institutions. The moral imperative to help these people does not change the fact that they're going to struggle to live a good life, let alone play the role of an active citizen of their host country. 

Now, it is true that Britain has a history of invasion and occupation at the cost of many innocent lives, but over the same period of time it has been domestically the most stable, peaceful country in the world. I would welcome immigrants being more sceptical of intervention abroad, but that doesn't alter any difference in the day to day attitude towards violence or towards the government/police.

Skin colour is a proxy for these sorts of issues because the majority of instable countries are in Africa. In reality someone who moves from Cameroon or the West Indies shares few of these cultural issues with someone from Sudan. But they will share problems getting a good job, and so will probably live in similar areas, and have their kids grow up in similar areas. And then you have an element of the self-fulfilling prophecy: because of this ghettoization, and the history of racism, you get the formation of a separate black urban culture, and black kids are afraid of 'acting white', by which they mean middle-class, and behaving in a way that allows them to get professional jobs and move out of inner-city areas.

I'm actually very sympathetic to this point.  Some of my colleagues wouldn't be, and would claim small businesses are just as exploitative, if not more so than transnational corporations.  I don't agree.  In the final analysis, ""come the glorious day"" I'd want them to operate in a democratic and cooperative manner, but I don't see them as the immediate enemy.  As has been pointed out elsewhere though, firstly, these family run small businesses were not the majority of places targeted (far far more chains, franchises and transnational corporations were attacked.  Secondly, there may be many reasons why businesses were targeted, we don't know anything about existing local tensions, and we're not going to read about them in the establishment press.  And thirdly, when people are really really angry, they might possibly confound those who sit at the black heart of capitalism with those who are merely apologists for it.  I have nothing but sympathy for those who were singled out unfairly, and if I had my way they'd've been in a far more powerful position to defend their rights and their property, but let's not conflate those who are part of the problem and those who are part of the solution (assuming they wish to be).

true,abw,cnty-uk,Surrey,"&gt; Its called school, college, apprenticeships and university.

Well yes, to school and college.  But apprenticeships don't exist any more in the UK (a sweeping generalisation, perhaps, but if they do then they're certainly hard to find and massively over-subscribed).  And a university will cost you £9k per year, plus living costs.

My point was more that we collectively spend a lot of time, money and effort on rehabilitating prisoners (those that can be bothered) to the tune of £50k+ a year, when that money would be better spent on providing better education, vocational training and job opportunities for young people so that they don't end up in prison in the first place.  Prevention being better than cure, and all that. 

&gt; Interesting to note thart abw didn't say what the qualifications were

It was manwithabadheart, but yes, it would be interesting to know.  

&gt; they could be GCSE Maths and English for all we know.

Perhaps, but let's not get elitist about it.  There are plenty of people from lower socio-economic groups who leave school with very poor literacy and numeracy skills (i.e. a long way from GCSE level).  In some cases, we're talking about people who can't read or write.

For those kind of people, GCSE Maths and English would be a great achievement and quite possibly life changing.  But the really significant thing is that they're starting to move in the right direction, even if they're only taking small steps.

Before when he killed his race, killed most of the Daleks, and was considered the ""Oncoming Storm"" it was more of a righteous good guy thing. He had to stop his people from destroying everything in the universe. He was trying to stop the Time War so that everyone else could live. It was the hard choice, but to us and the Doctor it was the best choice. 

But now he is considered the bad guy. He is a mighty warrior and people are afraid of him. This man who only wanted to travel the universe and see it wonders. A man who can't stand to see a child cry without helping. He has been deem bad enough to warrant a universe wide war. He insights fear in even honest people. 
 
Really I think that might be considered a low point. The Doctor is no longer the wise man that helps people, but the warrior who destroys.

Is it barbaric to expect honest people's tax to continue to fund those who are guilty of so much suffering?

I don't think these people should lose their benefits. It would be unfair for those who are unemployed etc. to suffer more than those who aren't. But I do think that from now on, there should be some kind of clause that would reduce benefits if found guilty of antisocial behaviour.  

There has to be a punishment that will impact people. Certainly, some have been severely punished for there part in this weeks events. But there are plenty of people who get away the rest of the time, having lost nothing of any consequence to them. If I was arrested and convicted, I'd probably lose my job which would land me in all sorts of financial problems. If Benefits Bill does the same, he loses nothing he held onto before.

It might not be the final answer, but it might cause a few families to think again. And if that's the case, I do think that it deserves at least looking into.

Would it be better to have some people suffer more, if less people committed crimes at all?

Also, what's the point of a counter petition? Surely the e-petition is to get something debated, at which point people can express their disgust. We aren't a country that is simply run by public opinion, and if it pisses off the majority of the public but works, surely its the politicians job to do it anyway. This e-petition thing is a Tory bag of shite to make us feel like we have a say when in reality then can simply ignore it.

The council (Brighton &amp; Hove) told them that they were applying to the court for an eviction notice. It would take 21 days to get a hearing and if granted they would have 28 days to depart. There was some talk about the Green-controlled council having some pretty barmy policies regarding travellers sites that I know nothing about really, so I don't know whether it would change in different regions.

I think they do.

&gt; If you are in a council flat and living on the dole you are far from 'in poverty' as the news like to sensationalise it as.

Would you be satisfied with that life knowing that there was no way you would move up no matter how hard you worked? I know I would put a bullet in my head rather than live that way.

&gt; If you are poor in this country its because you are spending your money on trainers TVs and drugs, not the essentials you need.

Except for that whole thing about 20% of these kids can't find a decent job or any job for that matter. 

&gt; Notice the looters weren't scrounging around looking for something to eat, not wearing rags, not homeless, they were after consumerist goods **they cannot afford.**

And therein lies the rub. I am suggesting that if these kids had a job where they had enough disposable income that they could buy their own food and technological baubles you wouldn't be seeing this rioting.

&gt; These aren't people with a political message, they are like children having a tantrum when they don't get the new toy or video game they want.

Or, there are people who are telling you that they don't want to live like this and are demanding an option. And if you can't provide, they are going to burn your world down. (And no, I do not condone this.)

&gt; People have grown up in this country living on the dole all their lives and do not seem to realise that if they want something nice they should have to earn it.

Again, as another way of looking at it, maybe they saw their parents live on the dole for their entire lives and are letting you know that they will not accept that life - and I can't blame them. There is no working their way out of it if there are no jobs for one out of five of them. 

&gt; People in this country have to realise that they cannot not bother in school, not get their GCSEs and A-levels, the opportunity of which this country gives to you free, then live their life on the dole and expect something better.

So, those people who cannot excel in school should be relegated to the dole? I can't accept that. What needs to be done is a decent job with a good wage needs to be provided for everyone who wants to work. People are judged by what they do for work and these people want to be something.

&gt; Thats not how the world works.

Then the world will have to change because this generation is not going to sit down for it. And you aren't going to like the lengths they will go to get their way, trust me on that one.",0,1313354484,null,0,false,0,c2cfybj,t3_jidmk,t1_c2cfybj,t1_c2cfdho,1427471252,0,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,0

Cambridge isn't a campus-based university, as has been said already - it's split into small colleges located within the town. Most colleges, with the exception of a few (Girton, Wolfson, Homerton, some of the newer colleges) are very close to the centre of town. In town there's supermarkets, cafes, drug stores, bookstores, and generally anything you might need.

In terms of supermarkets, Sainsbury's is located in town on St. Andrew's Street, just opposite Sidney Sussex college, and is open until midnight every day except Sunday when it closes at 4 (I think?). There are larger stores further out of town, including a huge Tesco off East Road, and various discount stores like Aldi towards the north, where I live.

For Walmart-esque clothes shopping, TK Maxx (TJ Maxx in America) is just off market square, or Primark is by the Grafton centre. Primark will sell you essentials for very low prices, but they'll be pretty low quality. TK Maxx will sell you overstocked fashion items cheapish, but you can't ever tell what they'll have.

Since it's collegiate, there isn't really a central location for undergraduates to hang out. There is, however, the [University Centre](http://www.unicen.cam.ac.uk/), sometimes called the 'grad pad', which has its own restaurant, cafeteria and gym, and is very grad-student-friendly.

Getting a bike is unnecessary, but may turn out to be very helpful. Cambridge is a small town, but depending on the location of your living quarters and your department, you might save a lot of time by cycling. Play it by ear - it won't be absolutely necessary, so see how you feel after a week or so. There's plenty of places you can buy bikes in town, but I'd recommend King Street Cycles on (shocker) King Street for second-hand bikes.

As for cell phones - there's plenty of shops in town that can answer your question better than I can. Have a wander around and ask about - there isn't a huge difference between any of the providers, and a lot of them share networking infrastructure, so there isn't a huge difference between network coverage, either. It's hard to say exactly which will best suit your needs - I'm afraid you'll probably have to research that yourself when you get here, but know that there won't be a big difference anyway.

A sandwich and a drink in town can cost different amounts depending on where you buy them, but usually you'll be able to get a meal deal comprising a sandwich, a drink and a pack of crisps (sorry, chips) in Sainsbury's or Boots for about £3.50. If you're looking for a gourmet sandwich and a latte, probably more like £5 or £6. Your college will be able to serve you hot meals every day for considerably cheaper than anywhere you'd find in town, but probably about the same amount or slightly more expensive than if you were cooking for yourself, so that's also an option.

Any clarifications you'd like, please ask! If you wanted to provide your college, it'd be a lot easier to tailor recommendations, but don't feel pressured to do so :)",0,1313355453,null,0,false,0,c2cg21l,t3_jijbt,t1_c2cg21l,t3_jijbt,1427471302,5,false,cambridge_uni,t5_2s17x,5

That said, two points.  One, in the Library River had tried to reach the Doctor and here is someone behaving very Doctorishly in a place where no one else should be.  River is at least that clever.  Two, Moffat has said that, whether or not we saw it on screen, there was another meeting between River and Ten -- after her death from Ten's point of view, but prior to her Library visit from River's perspective.  So she *did* already know him as an incarnation of the Doctor, one with whom she had dealt, albeit not her favorite and the one she spent the most time with.

With most crime, there is little possible in the way of restoration. A junkie steals your car and sells it for drugs, how would he make that up to you? He can't afford to buy you a new one. Would you be satisfied if he promised to never do it again? Would you believe him? If you said yes, then you are a much more forgiving man than myself, and the majority of the population.

In an ideal world, restoring the criminals empathy, access and rehabilitation into society with restoration would be fantastic. But we don't live in an ideal world. You can't persuade people who have lived for 15 years believing that they don't have to be part of a community, that they should now start caring because the people they hated before are telling them to.

true,strolls,null,null,"The government protects money in a bank up to c ~~£10,000.~~ £85,000.

If you have more than ~~£10k~~ £85k then you're safe (under current laws and regulations) if you keep it in different banks, each under that amount (i.e.  ~~£10k~~ £85k  with one bank,  ~~£10k~~ £85k  with another, ~~£5k~~ £20k with a third).

The question of whether you can rely on this if things go *really* bad is one you have to debate for yourself - it's never been tested. But if numerous banks fail and the government has to print money then inflation will screw you, anyway.

There's no way to really protect yourself beyond that, as far as I'm aware, and keep your money in money. Cash or bank deposits are at risk if there's a sufficient financial failure, and those are the only way you can get interest. This is just another facet of investing - higher returns means higher risks.

A good investment will ""always"" be property. I say that in quotes because of the inflated property prices we saw c 10 years ago, and the subsequent crash. Lots of people lost money. It may or may not be a good time to buy right now, but if you can afford to buy a second house (you used to be able to get a buy-to-let mortgage with no questions asked if you had a 25% mortgage) then you can consistently get rental income from that.

Whether that property is currently an optimal investment in conventional terms is not what I'm interested in right now. It's probably ok, though - look for foreclosures; cheap houses that look like shit but have no major structural problems, just needing a lick of paint; houses that you might not want to live in yourself - they're cheap but they still have rentable value, probably a better rate per £ of investment than high-end properties. What *is* important in the context of this discussion is that it's probably *safe* - it's preferable to own outright or keep as much equity as possible in it, and have as much buffer as possible against this, but as long as you can keep renters in it, you can probably keep up with any mortgage payments. It's unlikely we'll see some kind of communist wealth redistribution that would see someone with a second home being denounced as ""bourgeois"" and getting their rental property repossessed by the state. So property is an investment which will last a lifetime, as long as you're realistic about it.

Property rental agencies have a fairly good understanding of the rate of return on this kind of investment - it's not a license to print money, but returns can be pretty good (against the *current* value of the house, which may go up or down) and it's safe. We live on a small island, and I doubt there will be a housing glut in our lifetime. Talk to rental agencies - they're happy to help.

If you're paranoid about collapse, gold is another way to keep some of your money. Again, this doesn't accrue interest, but it's safe if the pound is suddenly worthless - I mean worthless to the extent that the government's printing money at silly rates. You will get about the same value back (less conversion costs) that you paid. People like to laugh about ""paranoid conspiracy theorists"" hoarding gold, but it would probably have paid off had you invested before the 1920s US depression, and it's proven in the case of the [Argentine Economic Crisis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentine_economic_crisis). That is a case of a modern democratic state ""just like us"" suffering economic collapse, and it's worth reading about. A guy wrote a really good ""survival guide"" based on his experiences living through that, and [his insights are somewhat remarkable](http://ferfal.blogspot.com/2008/10/thoughts-on-urban-survival-2005.html) - everyday life got turned upside down there. Descriptions of the situation tend to  fuel the ""it could never happen to us"" crowd, because they simply can't imagine these circumstances, but Argentina had strong agriculture, for example, famous worldwide for their beef. What went wrong? So I guess you can buy Krugerrands for circa £300 cash in [Hatton Garden](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hatton_Garden) (shop around, do your homework, compare with [online prices](http://www.bullionuk.com/products/gold/coins/south_africa?gclid=COij6ouB0KoCFdQOfAodcXXwfw)), and those are very fungible; you might even be able to buy jewellery (see the Argentinian blog) there at scrap gold prices if you allow the jeweller a little mark-up.",0,1313367396,null,0,true,0,c2ch96h,t3_jirkp,t1_c2ch96h,t3_jirkp,1427471867,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

I don't see why we shouldn't do that, when we consider that there has never been a fair distribution of land in this country. William of Normandy took land by force from those living there before him, and shared it amongst his barons. Both the Enclosures Acts and Thatcher's sale of council houses took public assets which belonged to the people and sold them off, ignoring the needs of future generations to profit short-term tenants.

You seem to be saying that people have a right to property simply because they've held it historically, or bought into a political/economic system which you believe in. But we don't share that premise.

&gt;  ""bought the land legally""

The law is a convenience. It is something that humans have made up, it is not somehow ""inherently right"" - it is something we call right because it suits as a society. Culturally the gypsies may have good grounds to say there is nothing legal about the way property is owned in this country.

&gt; If they want to live in the UK, then they should follow the law as it stands today.

true,[deleted],null,null,"I defended Starkey at the time as I don't believe he himself is a racist. I do believe he is disconnected and therefore made bold leaps in thought that end up seeming racist, racism being a thought one group, usually ones own, is inherently better than another.

But this young man doesn't have the same excuse, damning himself even by claiming to be a ""fan"" of hip-hop, citing specifically the new Jay Z &amp; Kanye West collaborative album, Watch The Throne.

His claim is the culture Starkey spoke of is definitively black. But what *did* Starkey speak of? Rap on it's own? No, I recall he specifically spoke of a ""gangster culture"" of greed, destruction and nihilism. Can anyone argue this is something unique to the black criminal class? Long before the first black immigrant settled on these shores was there a problem in this country of overly generous and creative criminals?

The thing people need to do is define culture. Nicking the definition from the Oxford dictionary, culture in this context is defined as:

&gt;the ideas, customs, and social behaviour of a particular people or society.

Looking at the above definition, can we really take the ""culture"" Starkey is talking about and even call it that? If you take any given activity or state of being, then break down the racial group of the people that primarily are part of it, are we comfortable calling that activity a culture or part of a culture despite the *wider* part of that same group not taking part? 

The *majority* of black people do not live a hip-hop lifestyle. Most would admit to being casual and passive listeners as the author of this piece is. If it's a culture then he's as much a part of it as they are. His reasoning and that of those that claim this is black ""culture"" is that it's something done by mostly black people and is therefore a part of our wider culture. Well figures will show that the majority of serial killers are white. The majority of paedophile Catholic priests are white. The majority of mass shooting gunmen have been white. Are these things therefore part of white culture? Are they a part of everyday white customs and behaviour?

Of course not. These are not things that influence or are influenced by the majority of white, western customs and ideals. These things would only be cultural if we fallowed the above lazy definition of culture rather than one similar to that laid out in dictionaries all over the World.

And that's what this comes down to. Laziness. The same sort of laziness this journalist showed when listening to and then condemning the Jay Z/Kanye album as a mere ""celebration of gats, hos, casual sex and easy money"". Firstly, he's right in one aspect...it glorifies money and sex. Where he's wrong is it doesn't paint it as ""easy"" money. These are two very egotistical men who want you to praise them for making millions and by no means do they want you to think it was easy. This is an album about bragging, but not just about *having* the wealth, but about being good enough at what they do to have amassed that wealth in the first place. The spoils of this money, being the clothes, cars and women, are just incidental. And then there's his lazy invoking of ""gats"". Firstly, the word gat isn't used by either rapper on the whole album. Guns are only referenced twice on the whole album in two separate songs. One, where Jay Z metaphorically personifies his dreams as his friend The Notorious B.I.G. and claims his dreams died in Las Vegas in a hail of automatic gunfire. Hardly glorifying gun violence. The next is a song called ""Murder to Excellence"" in which the rappers lament the senseless and needless loss of young life to gun crime and implore young people to stop...yeah, this guy didn't really listen to the album. The rest is the same boring ""I'm great, and as such have amassed great wealth"". I'm not a fan, but it only took me a few minutes of looking to find all this out, all without myself listening to the album either. I looked up an read the actual lyrics, rather than casually nodding my head and dismissing it with my own pre conceived prejudices.

The premise Delingpole is defending is that it is fine to assume a well spoken well meaning and well brought up person, before you see them or meet them, is white. He simply fails to see the problem in this. The premise hinges on the idea that *most* black people are not well spoken law abiding members of society and it's OK to default in your mind to ""illiterate criminal"" when thinking about us. Are we to believe the majority of black people are in fact teenagers and we all speak using ghetto street vernacular? I'm certain my parents don't, and the majority of my friends, also in their early 30's, and their parents don't.",0,1313373474,null,0,true,0,c2chxye,t3_jitvy,t1_c2chxye,t3_jitvy,1427472261,25,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,25

true,rbnc,cnty-wales,Wales. Living in Germany.,"I've never told this story before, but I'd like to give this a bit of context because presently I'm ashamed of my generation. It makes me so angry that I worked so hard for years to attain what I have, as I kid I was far poorer than any of these 'rioters'. I could never have afforded Nike clothing or Blackberrys. I'm not saying these people don't live in poverty because they have these things. But to me, I don't see poverty as an excuse for theft in this country. I evidently lived in deeper misery and poverty than a lot of these kids and certainly more than those people in the documentary posted here. We had a 20 year old TV, second-hand clothes and on occasion couldn't afford food, because my dad had other priorities.


I'm 25, I grew up on a council estate in East Brighton before and after it got cleaned up in the last 90s. I, nor my family would have never, ever would have been able to afford something like a Blackberry or a new TV, we just
about managed with food and most of our clothing was second-hand, I
had the piss take out of me at school for not wearing the right stuff.
I used to have to walk miles each to get to a good school because the
bus fares went up and we couldn't afford it. I never stole clothes and I never took the bus without paying.

I never stole, I never would have contemplated stealing. Not having
stuff I wanted just drove me to work hard and make something of my
life, unlike my shitty parents. My separated mother and father, clinically depressed and drug addicted respectively.

I always loved computers, I was fascinated with them when I got the opportunity to play with them. I wanted dreamed of getting into
programming, obviously I didn't have a computer at home because we
couldn't afford such things, so to learn I used to have to go to the
library, writing shit down, coming home and learning it, then going to
the library the next day and trying it out. It was tedious but at no
point did I consider stealing. 

At 16, my dad and I were living in a 1 bedroom flat. He was living in the front room. Living with him got too much. I had to move into a hostel for 'homeless' kids. I carried on through college and ace'd my grades and got into a great uni. Unfortunately, I dropped out of uni after doing my sandwich placement year. It is is extremely difficult without parental support, even with bursaries and loans. I never stole. 

With a little bit of work experience under my belt, I got an internship, I was paid £400 a month. My rent was £280, in a cockroach infested bedsit. I had £120 a month, £30 a week to get to work, pay bills, feed and clothe myself, less than someone on benefits. I never stole.

After 3 months I was offered a full-time job, it was only £15k and then I could finally just about afford stuff like a nice phone, tv, computer etc and I had worked for it; I never stole.

Now I'm 25, I live in another country, I earn decent money as a computer programmer. I was never given anything aside from the same welfare that these kids get, and this was pre-EMA. I'm nothing special but I used my initiative, worked hard and as cheesy as it is; achieved my dreams and furthermore: I never stole.",0,1313397021,null,0,true,0,c2ck91h,t3_jilli,t1_c2ck91h,t3_jilli,1427473347,12,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,12

true,lackofbrain,cnty-uk,Nowhere in particular,"&gt; I'd like see teachers having to renew their qualifications every couple of years

Teachers already have to do Continuing Professional Development, but there is certainly scope to strengthen that and ensure teachers are up to date on current techniques and theories, etc. 

&gt; or at least be more closely monitored by ofstead

This would not be popular, but I can see where you are coming from. Ofstead may need stronger tools to assess individual teachers, perhaps? 

&gt; The bar to entry needs to be raised, so attracted stronger candidates a pay rise would've needed.

Currently you need a post-graduate level teaching qualification. Although you don't need to have a degree you need to be able to show aptitude at that level before you can enter the course, for instance large amounts of experience. What *would* help is not moving these goal-posts every two years! 

&gt; Looking at the system in Germany, students are funnelled into different types of schools from early on in their education. Brighter students go to colleges while less bright go to technical colleges and then often ease straight into apprenticeships.

We used to have the 11+ which funnelled people into either grammar schools or secondary moderns. It was scrapped because there is a lot of evidence that streaming is unhelpful especially for the worse-performing students. Some children have not developed their full capacity by the time they are 11 and thus will be misplaced, and changing after that point is extremely hard. There is also a self-fulfilling-prophecy aspect whereby you repeatedly remind a child they are not smart enough for a grammar school and thy will stop trying! Evidence suggests that grouping based on ability is better for the best performing and worse for the worst performing, whereas chucking everyone into mixed-ability classes has the opposite effect - drawing up the bottom and pulling down the top (it's also more difficult to teach mixed ability classes)

What is currently standard practice (and has been for at least a decade) is setting. That is on a  subject by subject basis pupils are put into high or low attainment classes. For example you may be in top set for maths, second set for science, and bottom set for French. To my mind this is a reasonable compromise to a very difficult decision - are the high achievers or the low achievers more important?

I would like to see a greater acceptance and availability of vocational courses pre-16, and a greater availability of academic courses post-21, however. 

&gt; What works well with our system is the diverse choice of subjects, and that you select qualifications rather than simply graduating with a diploma like in the US.

I am inclined to agree with you here. some would argue that over-specialisation too early is a problem, and they have a point but overall I think our system of specialisation is not too bad. I would like to see greater availability of the International Baccalaureate, however, for those people who can't or don't want to specialise to the extent that A-levels require at that age.

true,The3rdWorld,eng-essex,Essex,"It saddens me no end that any talk of this problem always comes down to a lazy few who simply don't want to work - i don't even really believe they exist in any but the smallest number, i don't say this as an aloof middle class philosophiser i say it as a member of said demographic.  The issue is that not everyone wants to devote their entire life to wage-slavery and a system which has been nothing but cruel to them.  
  
Luke didn't like the Empire, Gandhi didn't like the British Raj and today's downtrodden don't like the boot upon their face either.  The reason Grime music, Track Suit culture and all the other aspects of the underground most people can't comprehend exist is as a way of separating oneself from the cultural machine.  We have an exclusively mono-cultural perspective in this country, all this absurd talk of multiculturalism is surely a joke?  Sure you can have skin of whatever colour you like or believe any religion you like or any social philosophy just as long as it happens to conform exactly to our system - as long as you're willing to work tirelessly to mould yourself into being the perfect worker then we'll defend your right to be like us.  
  
Many people simply don't buy into this, many people see themselves as the 'them' to societies 'us' - this is the real problem, the structure of our society, our society hates poor people.  We expect them to work their way up the ladder, to try super hard and become a boss - as if we don't understand the basic fact that a pre-robot society needs a large body of workers to turn the wheels!  Pretending that everyone can be in the top 10% is hurting our brains, destroying our value system and shattering long established social systems - we need to change things so that being poor is an acceptable life choice, it sounds absurd but really not everyone wants to be a billionaire -many of us are just happy working and earning enough to get by, today's system where we make it impossible to get by unless you work every hour under then sun and then some is terrible.  
  
So in short i'm saying that the people you say 'just don't want to work' are in reality more often than not perfectly willing, if not wanting, to work (no one *wants* to work) however they have two choices as they see it - devote their entire life and probably early death to putting up with every new insult the capitalist class can throw down at them and even then the likelihood is they'll never achieve anything other than tiredness OR they can struggle to make ends meet, spend time with friends or family, maybe work on the garden or the car...  
  
In reality for many both options lead to the same thing, and those of course are only those lucky enough to be furnished the skills needed in this world - others let down by education systems and our societies anti-intellectualism can't even understand they have a choice, to them the only official options are our of reach.
  
Rather than lament that some people will always be lazy, which is of course always going to be true and just as true of the moneyed aristocracy as the impoverished poor, we should instead focus on important issues such as whats the best way of making sure the people that actually do the work which drives our national machine get treated right and how can we help people make the best of themselves?",0,1313404731,null,0,false,0,c2ckm3h,t3_jilli,t1_c2ckm3h,t1_c2ci44i,1427473518,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

Traditionally universities existed for the academic elite: to facilitate a higher learning than available in the typical workplace. Now they are being used to teach vocational courses (apprentiships anyone?) and the difficulty being reduced (and thus the value reduced) to accommodate the increasing number of students that the government thinks should go to university.

Not everyone has the intelligence to do a degree, and it's wrong to make them think they can, or should be doing one.

In reply to your points:
&gt;will possibly mean numbers increase to maybe 90%

That’s a really bad thing, Universities will become even less valuable

true,E_mE,eu,"Berlin, DE","German students are not funnelled with Exams like in the UK (which i'm deadly against), when going into high school they are evaluated by their primary school teacher and suggestions are given based on their abilities.  

The German system is fairly diverse, you can go to one of 4 different types of school:

Note: you can move between high schools if you abilities improve. 

*Hauptschule* - The lower of the schools, which you gain a qualification at 16 and are generally encouraged into Modern Apprenticeships or some employment based education. Which in my opinion is great and the UK really should encourage more Apprenticeship schemes, it really give everyone an opportunity to make something out of their lives.

*Realschule* - Kind of a middle school, where you can gain either the 16 year old qualification and follow the similar route as Hauptschule, or you can carry on, to do your Abitur at the age of ~18 - which in the UK is equivalents to A-levels or other college based qualification, which will then allow you to university.

*Gymnasium* - This is the higher level of school, which educates you until your 18 with an Abitur, then which allows you to go to university.

*Gesamtschulen* - A comprehensive school which incorporates all of the previous 3 schools into one.

I'm a fan of the German system because it allows the student to gain confidence and self esteem at there own level and around students which are of similar levels (minimising competition), and if their level increases, move up. One of the biggest hindrance to a child's education IMHO is about the confidence of their level, if the student is socially equipped to get out of education what he/she desires, he/she will achieve far higher.

Also, the fact that kids don't start formal education until there 6-7 years old is a big plus, because it allows the younger children to start discovering what they enjoy and are good at without the pressures of the big 3 subjects. 

Personally I will be moving to Germany in a couple years time where myself and partner will be planning to have kids because of the education system in Germany. It just appears to be superior and not so demanding on younger children, also the teacher-parent relationship still exists strongly and society in a whole don't let children behave like little adults. All in all, children are still children in Germany where as in the UK, it appears that adults are demanding adult like systematics from children which is terrible.

true,AlanCrowe,null,null,"I'd start by getting a sense for numbers. With a population of 60million and a life expectancy of 70 years, there are a little less than a million persons in each year age band. Thus the provision of education to 5 to 16 year olds provides for getting on for 10million persons. Organised as schools of around 1000 pupils there are around 10000 schools.

Design an education system? Are we talking about the kilo-pupil scale and the role of the headmaster? Are we talking about kilo-school scale and the role of the minister for education? I hope for very different approaches at the kilo-pupil level and the kilo-school level. 

I hope that each headmaster has a vision for his school and leads vigorously. He has his theory of education and knows in detail how things are supposed to work. When things don't work he can investigate and compare practice with theory and fix the discrepancy.

On the other hand I hope that the watch words of the kilo-school scale are *humility* and *contestability*. The goal of the kilo-school scale is to maintain systems of measurement and feedback.

The typical conflict is that headmaster A uses teaching method X and headmaster B uses teaching method Y. The typical error is to try to design the kilo-school level with a built-in choice. The minister for education chooses X or Y. Let's say X. Then the system forces headmaster B to use teaching method X. It all goes horribly wrong when X turns out to be a poor choice.

It is much more important that the kilo-school level of the system maintain a system of examinations worth passing and provides transparency about which teaching method, X or Y, each candidate was trained with. This is the measurement side of education. We do this in a half-hearted way.

You know how the story goes. Headmaster A says that method X is the one true method because his pupils score 10% higher on the tests. Headmaster B says that his schools catchment area is deprived and has 20% less potential; his method, Y, has actually come out 10% better when measured correctly. 

The mad scientist in me wants to randomise the assignment of pupils to schools and let headmaster A and headmaster B compete on an even footing to prove their educational theories. More realistically, one can examine pupils early in their school careers as well as later, and see what difference school is making. 

Notice how much teacher hates this. That is human nature. 90% of people think that they are above average. Honest assessments pop that bubble, which really hurts. And yet it has to be done, for schools are for the benefit of the pupils, not the teachers.

But there is a huge problem. The tradition of education is that examinations examine pupils only and have the magical property that they tell us how well the pupils learned but not how well the teacher taught. This is the hypocrisy of the adult world. We set crap examinations that are good enough for assessing children, but unacceptable for assessing adults. 

There is a second hypocrisy, equally evil. From time to time reforms introduce merit pay. It is based on examination results. The results in the same old crap examinations that were good enough for children, but not a suitable basis on which to adjust salaries of adults employed as teachers. The real point of merit pay is to force improvements in the exams. Once teachers start to feel it in the pay packet, they are supposed to insist on improving the examination system so that it is good enough for assessing adults, not just children.

The second hypocrisy is that teachers don't respond to merit pay by demanding better examinations. They just game the system, teaching to the test, getting higher scores, and more money but delivering worse education. Soon merit pay falls back into disrepute.

I'm over complicating my comment. It is fairly easy to say what outcome we want from the kilo-school level of organisation. Headmaster C comes up with a new method Z. Headmasters A and B watch and wait. If it proves to be a good method A and B copy it. If it proves to be a poor method C drops it.

We want the kilo-school level (and that includes us, commentors on reddit) to be humble. If headmaster C comes up with a new method, Z, it is not right for the kilo-school level to deliver an *a priori* judgment and either block Z or insist that A and B adopt it. One the other hand the kilo-school level must hold the ring for a genuine contest. One cannot tolerate a situation in which method Z clearly fails, but we have to wait for headmaster C to retire before his teachers can abandon it, nor can we tolerate a situation in which method Z clearly succeeds but we have to wait until headmaster A retires before his teachers are allowed to adopt it.

Do you think it's ok if those you consider to be ""British"" (you never did define at which point you stop being an immigrant) fail to operate as successful members of society? If not, why should someone who is a (for example) 3rd generation immigrant be treated than somone who is (for example) a 10th generation immigrant). How pure do your genes have to be for it to be ok to commit a crime?

Everything that happens to you in your life has some effect. That is true. However, your implication that asylum seekers' previous experiences make them likely to commit crime is quite false, although they are likely to be victims of crime.

&gt; Regardless of the imprecise, proxy nature of the relationship, the statistics are unfortunately very clear. Look at my post above- over 50% of people prosecuted for gun, knife and street crimes in London are black, even though they make up about 12% of the population.

I will address your misleading use of statistics in the comment where you referenced them. Once more, the statistics you quote show a correlation between prosecutions and skin colour. That does not indicate a causal relationship, and it does not even (as you imply) indicate that skin colour correlates to criminal activity. See the other comment for some reasons why.

&gt; Firstly, gun, knife and street crime statistics can be found in this Telegraph article, with the data coming from the government. To quote directly, ""of those proceeded against for street crimes, 54 per cent were black; for robbery, 59 per cent; and for gun crimes, 67 per cent.""

This paragraph is misleading. You have confused prosecution statistics with crime statistics (although to its credit, the Telegraph did not!). Prosecution statistics are subject to a huge amount of bias and need adjustment before you can use them to infer crime statistics. To give you a clear example of why, outside of the current situation, you might find that prosecution statistics in nazi Germany showed many crimes committed by jews, but no reasonable person would use these statistics to suggest that that meant jews were criminally inclined.

For more directly related reasons why prosecution statistics differ from actual crime statistics, you need look no further than your own post:

&gt; Black people are actually about 7x more likely to be stopped and searched

...meaning that if black people committed exactly the same amount of crime as white people (50/50 split), you would expect more prosecutions of black people than white people

&gt; The other interesting issue is that section 60 gives police more discretion- senior police officers choose where section 60 applies, and street-level officers can choose who to search without restriction- but as they are given this discretion they seem to use it to focus more on black people, which is perhaps not a positive indicator of attitudes at all levels within the police.

As you observed, when we are able to measure police bias it clearly shows strong weighting against black people. It seems reasonable to assume this bias is *at least* as prevalent where we cannot measure it.

&gt; There is also the apparent fact that black people are statistically more likely to commit the various types of crimes relevant to street searches. So there is some difference there, but it's not so disgraceful as is suggested.

As we can see from the above this ""fact"" is not so apparent after all.

And finally, regardless of statistics, the disparity between black and white stop and search figures is quite disgraceful enough.

true,back-in-black,english,England,"Well, you could watch [the TED talk on education by Sir Ken Robinson](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zDZFcDGpL4U) to understand what I think is wrong with education. 

But I do have a few things to add to this.

1) You can make kids go to school, but you cannot *make* them learn, nor can you make them *want* to learn. And yet, at the cost of the education of other children, we still try. Perhaps, what we need is a form of *triage*, when it comes to kids that just do not want to be at school. Perhaps we should do our best to ensure everyone has basic literacy and arithmetic (and there should be specific qualifications for this), but beyond that, everything else is *opt-in*. In other words, if you want to leave school after you have your basic 3R's and go and do an apprenticeship, fine. Academia is not for everyone, and we should stop trying to shove everyone into the same box. 

2) Elaborating on the *opt in*, mentioned in 1). For those that stay in education exposure to subjects for a short term is mandatory, but selection of the subjects for study toward a qualification is up to the pupil and teacher. In other words, I don't *have* to study Art for GCSE, but I do have to do a term in it before I decide I don't want to take it. Similarly, someone else may not want History, based on the introductory class they had in it. And that is fine. It's better to excel in a few subjects you like than to be mediocre across the board. 

3) Some people in later life are going to regret dropping out of school early with their 3R's, and are going to want to study again. They should be able to do this with as minimal a cost to themselves as possible, especially for ""in demand"" subjects like mathematics and the sciences. We have a patchy system for doing this already, but it needs improved.

4) Progression in a subject is not based on your age. If I am brilliant at Mathematics and English, but suck at Geography (even though I opted for it), then I should be able to study my better subjects at a quicker pace, advancing to a qualification sooner, and I should be able to do the reverse for my weaker subjects. 

5) No more summer holidays. It's a historical relic from a more agricultural era. Summer should be ""revision"" time for the rest of the years work - that means the kids can go on holiday with their families if they wish, and won't miss out on new material. 

What I'm trying to do with these points is to make school something that the pupil controls as much as possible, whilst still getting a grounding in essential subjects, and an exposure to things they may have otherwise dismissed out of hand. It also puts some power back in the hands of teachers; they don't have to teach disruptive pupils, and can get more done in the time they have available.

IMO, this is where we are going anyway with things like Khan Academy, which will no doubt start to spawn competitors soon.

Nurseries would be standardised and private nurseries much more heavily scrutinised. Meaning, they would have to have fully qualified nursery teachers. Toddlers would not start any form of nursery until at least 1-2 years old. (If you say this isn't fair on parents who want to get back to work, well sorry - then don't have children if you can't commit to bringing a new life to this world - if you are single parent etc, then help must be provided).

No nurseries would be more based on play and social interaction, getting children ready for understanding what they enjoy learning on an individual basis, removing a standard syllabus which removes a child's individuals desires. Of course there will be some minimal standard education based on reading, writing, science and maths - but this will not be fully focused upon, more integrated into play and other unconscious methods of interaction.

So hopefully by the time they reach primary school they will be confidence children ready for being taught, the focus on the social aspects will also encourage good behaviour because interaction between children and adults is part of there nursery education and are aware of behaviour and consequences.

Nursery will be funded by the parents but fully means tested, so every member of society can send there children to Nursery education. Even better would be that its completely free - but a focus on parents must be integrated into the 

Now, at 6-7 years old the child will enter primary education which will be purely based on the basics of the major subjects, such as Science, English, Maths, IT, Foreign Languages, Arts and other subjects. But the student will be pushed to focus on subjects they are individually very good at, as to keep there confidence high and gain a greater skill in something they are good at. All subjects will still be covered but focus must be on the child's talents, not governed or encouraged by business/political or other negative social elements. Eventually the child should reach a reasonable level where they parent and teacher and come to a conclusion that the student is best off going to a particular class of school.

true,The3rdWorld,eng-essex,Essex,"firstly by expecting people to live like 14th century peasants you're making sure they'll never develop the skills needed to survive in the work environment but more importantly you're wrong about the being able to afford things when working - haven't you been paying attention to this debate?  the few possibilities for employment pay such low wages that it's impossible to survive on them, surely you're more than ready to yipyipyip about the welfare trap being the cause of all these problems?  The 'welfare trap' as it's often called exists because it's possible to live on welfare but not on the wages any available work could supply this making the transition counter-productive from an individuals point of view.  
  
But regardless of how it is at the moment lets consider how it should be - surely you agree that mathematically speaking the lowest section (i.e. manual work, etc) is always (until robots) going to be largest - containing farm workers, machinists and et cetera it's also the most vital (ten farmers with no king eat better than ten kings with no farmers as the adage goes) - does it not then stand to reason that these people should be looked after, protected and provided for?  
  
All the verbal magic you can do to push the blame onto those that suffer is beside the point, we can't all be rich nor should we; simply pretending that these people are idiots for doing cleaning jobs or heavy lifting isn't  going to make these jobs go away - yes maybe you *did* manage to get a higher grade job but that doesn't mean that the cleaning job you might have otherwise done has vanished, someone has filled the position.  
  
In this regard it's useful to look at our energy strategy, simply expecting to forever have cheep oil could destroy our future and exactly the same goes for the cheep labour - we can outsource to India and China for now but it's not a long term strategy.  Only when our society accepts and welcomes the working class and makes sure they can live comfortably will we have a stable society.

true,[deleted],null,null,"I believe seperating pupils by ability is the only way forward.  Just as you cannot expect a higher tier pupil to be just learning his alphabet at the age of 11, you cannot expect a lower tier pupil to be learning calculus at the same age. 

Unfortunately, the education system currently seems to assume that all men are born equal, and it simply isn't true.  I have friends who are incredibly intelligent and friends who never will be - to have educated them at the same pace would have been an exercise in idealism that has no place in the real world.

I'd like to see education start at home, too.  Your children's education isn't solely the state's responsibility.  Read to them, count with them, sing with them.  Get them thinking.  Any child starting school that cannot do basic maths, read simple words and recide their alphabet is at a disadvantage.

As far as subjects go, I think more and more important are language skills (foreign and domestic), maths, sciences (seperate sciences - biology, chemistry, physics), technology (IT and some sort of hands-on craft) and physical education - exercise does a lot more than just keep you thin - it's very good for the mind.

We then need to look at vocational vs academic courses.  At some point it may be necessary to make a decision over which route to take.  I'm not an expert, so I can't say when it should be made or even who should make this decision, but I think teaching non-academic skills to non-academic pupils is the only way to safeguard their futures.  A 'G' in General Studies isn't going to land someone a job.  A certificate in something like Customer Service, Cash Handling, Introduction to Plumbing/Electrics, whatever(!) is going to be far more beneficial.

The real key lies in the parents, though.  Without encouraging parents what child will go home and actually do their homework, or study for an exam?  Very, very few.  We need to move the onus of education from being solely the state to a joint effort.

true,Fenris78,english,Norwich,"I'm married to a now ex-teacher. She's just stopped teaching now after about 5 years. From my 2nd hand view it's not bad teachers that are the problem. (Originally wrote this as a reply to ezekielziggy but might be better here)

The workload is high and the environment is stressful. Teachers are supposed to have a few free-periods each week for planning and marking. For many subjects these are insufficient, and they also seemed to get filled up with other duties to lack of resource. While teachers get a lot of holiday, it's not much of a remedy. It has to be taken at specific times so what I see is people powering through a half term, collapsing at the start of the break, and lesson planning for the latter part of it. 6 weeks in the summer isn't ideal either, that long off sends most people stir-crazy. I really appreciate my ability to take my holiday whenever I want and at short-notice.

So currently you have arguably over-worked teachers with seemingly little support. I'm as lefty as they come but when my partner gets physically threatened at work by a child, and that child is merely taken out of lessons for a day, I can see why it's frustrating. I don't have the answer, I don't know what we'd do with expelled children but it's shit.

Possibly the problem we have is that the best teachers generally end up in the best schools. I know that's obvious but schools in the best catchment areas etc can be more selective with who they employ and end up with the best teachers and that becomes a cycle. Just as the schools in the worst areas often end up with lower quality teachers. Most teachers want to teach, not crowd control.

I don't know if the answer is to be harder on the teachers. I think morale is already low enough, and it would feel like an attack against the profession. Although the job has its perks, I don't think they're as great as a lot of people assume. The salary's not bad, but it's not exceptional. You're going to get sworn at and threatened and possibly worse. They already feel there's too much ""tick-boxing"" in the job as it is, giving bonuses based on metrics would be extremely difficult. Do you give it based on what grades pupils get? Obviously some schools, much more due to socio-economic conditions in their catchment areas than poor teaching, get a lot lower grades so that doesn't seem fair. I've had my missus saying she's been tempted in the past just to rewrite student's coursework because they're not getting the grade they're ""supposed to"" and the student just isn't putting the effort in. If bonuses were on the line possibly that kind of thing would actually take place.

I guess in my opinion we need 1) smaller class sizes, 2) better ways to remove trouble children. That goes against some of my views but I'm not convinced we should be damaging other kid's educations trying to force it upon those who don't want it. It's almost impossible to ""exclude"" kids now, maybe if we actually had something we could do with them (some kind of military style boot camp? I don't know) then some kids could be dissuaded from fucking about, and those that were persistent could be removed.

Sure, my bike was nicked, but I was a twat and left it locked in plain sight on campus for three weeks or so. The house opposite us did once get robbed at gunpoint, but that was the only such incident I came across.

CoffeePoweredRobot is on the spot with the stereotype comment, though you will find yourself in the city centre frequently, because as beautiful as the campus is it remains shit for nights out. Things to remember so that you look like a pro straight off:

1. About three months into your first year, everyone will discover Cucamaras, a cheap-as-fuck cocktail bar off Market Square (the central area of city centre). What they won't realise until second year is that it's actually the wankest bar ever. Don't bother with it. If you want cocktails The House of Coco Tang on Bridlesmith Gate is much better, and Saltwater in the Cornerhouse is expensive as a courtesan's fuck, but unbeatable.

2. The best food in all of Nottingham is found at Delilah's, a deli opposite the contemporary art museum.

3. Do Campus 14, a masochistic bar crawl around the campus bars in which you drink 14 pints or doubles. Wake up the next morning without someone else's property in your bedroom, and you're a better man than me.

4. Keep an eye on both Broadway and Savoy cinemas for classic films being shown. The Savoy was always best for student film nights. Both serve alcohol, like all good cinemas should.

5. The Electric Banana at the Bodega Social Club might just be the best night out in the city. It should be, given that it's named after the fictional club Spinal Tap met at.

The gun crime thing is an overblown stereotype. The crime is no different from any other major city such as Manchester, Liverpool, Newcastle and Birmingham etc. Unless you're going to places like Oxford / Cambridge etc, it's going to be no different at all. Most of that 'shottingham' crap comes from one incident about 5 years ago where a young girl was shot by accident during a gang related drive by. She was walking back from the annual Goose Fair.

Something for everyone be it music, food or drink or the arts. If you want it, it'll be there somewhere. Cheap, moderate and expensive.
.
It has an incredibly high student population and a high population of foreign nationals so lots of places have popped up for everyone. 

Derby, Leicester, Sheffield, and Lincoln are all fairly short train (bus for Derby) rides away so people frequent Nottingham from those places and vice versa, they're also big student places so there's a lot on offer.

In Nottingham you can be walking down a run down area, turn the corner and you're where the rich live, places you just think wouldn't be there, such as Mapperly Park, and The Park etc.

The public transport has been voted the best in the UK and it shows.

There's a high female - male ratio and you'll find tons of incredibly attractive women from all over.

Plenty of cheap places to drink as well if you don't mind 'locals'.

true,waterweed,null,null,"Yeah, near as I can work out, they were implying she was taken between the end of series 5 and the beginning of Impossible Astronaut- which makes me wonder what *really* went wrong with the ship in A Christmas Carol.

Has anyone worked out the timeline for Amy's pregnancy, by the way?  She was taken very early on, since she didn't know she was pregnant.  IIRC Rory said it'd been two months since they'd seen the Doctor in Impossible Astronaut, and then they spent an additional three months in 1969 investigating the silence. So that's five months.  But the rest of the half-series didn't take up that much time- the Black Spot took place over a single night, didn't it? The Doctor's Wife only took a few hours, and the ganger episodes took a day or two- same with the battle of Demons Run.
So there's a missing three or four months there,  which might be something, or it might not.
near as I can figure out, there's a couple possibilities:

*  The gang got up to extra adventures in that time, and we just didn't see them.

But to address your question more directly: why don't we try to redistribute property more fairly, on an ongoing basis? That would give the *have-not*s less grounds for complaint.

If you live in the UK then you can't *not* take advantage of things provided by the state or belonging to other people - because everything has already been taken by the state and those that have gone before us.

Take it from me that Nottingham is one of the better cities in this country. Much like everywhere you need to use some simple sense and abide by the rules of not getting your shit ruined, but if you do that you shouldn't have any trouble. The worst I've ever encountered is being offered drugs, but that was when I lived in St. Anns, and having some bottles thrown in my direction by some chavs in Hyson Green.

Nottingham has good parts and bad parts, just like any city. Hyson Green, St. Annes and the Meadows probably being the most risky areas, with Radford, Beeston and West Bridgeford amongst the better ones. Nottingham city is well patrolled by the cops and has good CCTV; it's also busy enough that people will focus on their own night and leave you alone, assuming you abide by those common sense rules of street smarts.

The gun crime is much less of an issue these days than it used to be, certainly from my vantage point. If you don't run with the gangs - and, being a student at the UoN, you of course won't be - you might not even hear of a shooting, let alone be close to one or at the recieving end.

Here's my real problem. If you go with the philosophy AVB has shown so far (i.e. left/right forwards play more towards goal than on the wing, use wing backs to create width), it crowds the area in front of goal and thus the player in the hole is no longer able to pop shots on goal. This is why Lampard looked so lost on Sunday against Stoke. It's a delicate balancing act... either you get more players in the box to link up and/or finish from crosses, or you open the field up and get open shots at the top of the box.

During my first year at the uni, sure I heard some of the things you're hearing now, but it is honestly a very safe city. 

The worst stories I've heard are about students who have had their houses robbed because they forgot to close a window or lock a door. There are some places in Nottingham (around the campus) that you'll want to avoid, like Radford, that place is scary as shit at night. 

I assume you'll be staying in halls the first year, but after that, you'll probably want to move to an area around or in Lenton, which is where all the students are. 

The City itself is great, and a good distance away from the campus, about an hour walk. It's very safe at night though, I would always go out with friends and take cabs home at the end of the night. 

The Nottingham police department is great and were one of the few city's to actually control the riots well, as well as keep the public informed. They had a twitter account under nottspolice which they used to keep the public informed. 

Overall, as a student, you should have no problems living there at all, as most of the places you go to will be very safe. 

If you have any questions, feel free to send me a PM, I'd be happy to help. I also believe that the reddit presence in Nottingham is ridiculously low.

Father's Day- shows the love that Rose has for her father. She can go anywhere and do anything, and what she wants to do is see her father again. This relates to her actions in the parallel universe.

Love and Monsters- This one isn't as important as it doesn't show the doctor as a main character, but it does show his empathy towards humans.

Fear Her- Same, not as important but EVERYBODY LIVES!....although he doesn't say that everybody does and it once again fleshes his character.

Midnight- Shows the doctor's character's obsessive need to help other species(and his giddy reactions to danger) as well as showing how human's have stupid reactions that are on the spot and that the doctor NEEDS to help.

Last Season:
Players in = $18.5M
Players out = $1M
This doesn't include Keane and Ohara which probably both total $5M

Plus VDV and Sandro probably came in at the top end of the wage scale. 
Last year they made around $20million in profit, and they are probably looking to do the same again, plus squirrelling some away for the Northumberland project if it ever goes ahead.

In terms of a quality striker, Levy is tighter than a ducks backside, and he wants the club to never be financed by debt. He will never sell players unless he knows he can make something out of it, and the club is generally unwilling/incapable to try to match the wage levels of the other big 4. Currently there are 12 players in the squad that played less than 6 games for Spurs last season (which was actually 14 players at the end of the season), compared to Man City who only had 9.

So yeah, there is a lot of dead wood there and not a lot of movement at the station. The club is looking, obviously courting Rossi and Llorente, but unless Kranjcar, Crouch, Pav, Defoe etc make room, it is hard to see where they are going to get the expected $35m cash from.

This is him after trying everything he could think of (and remember, he's The Doctor, he can think of a lot) and still coming up with nothing. This (to me anyway) is him after months, years, maybe decades of searching and fighting for River, Amy and Rory and being no closer than when he left Demon's Run. To me, this is the Doctor realizing that this time he won't save the day. He's not buzzing around the TARDIS, he's not pushing switches and throwing buttons, he's sitting still and quiet in the dark. He knows it's Amy calling (of course the TARDIS has caller ID) and she isn't even worried. She has complete faith in The Doctor. She has no way of knowing how lost he is, how tired he is and that her belief that he will win the day makes so much worse the fact that he knows he can't.

I guess it stayed with me enough that I was able to recognize that I saw it before. I have not read Harry Potter in a long time.

The surest way to escape poverty traps and gang controlled estates should be a scheme to reward people who provide incriminating evidence against gang ring leaders. (Though I suspect there are practical cost problems with that)

The authority of local government and the police is in large part ""us"", at least in the UK.  The police work remarkably closely with communities to police ""by consent"", adapting their policies to local tolerances.  Their primary job is facilitate order in our towns, homes, and schools, not just impose a standard by force. So, yes, ""we"" have a part to play in establishing the safe place for our work and families.  Treating the police / government as some thoroughly rotten ""other"" is as poisonous as saying all the rioters were dehumanised ""evil thieving chavs"".
 
But that in no way diminishes the fact that these crimes were not acts of desperation by the ""oppressed poor"" to feed their hungry babies, but rather the selfish and violent acts of people who should know better and either didn't care for the pain they knew they were inflicting or didn't fear the consequences.
