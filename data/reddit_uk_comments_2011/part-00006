Funny how Americanisms in British English are perceived over here as lowbrow and vulgar, and Britishisms in American English are criticised as pretentious.

It's almost like *both* nationalities have absorbed the same stereotype of Brits as effete, upper-class snobs and Americans as lowbrow, vulgar oiks. &lt;:-)

&gt; After all, as Bill Bryson has said: ""Without America's contribution, English today would enjoy a global importance on a par with Portuguese."" 

Hmmm... I hesitate to disagree with someone as well-read as Bryson, but I'm pretty sure Portugal didn't have an empire that the sun *literally* didn't set on, and that it didn't largely maintain that empire right up until WWII, seeding Anglophone (or in their case Lusophone) cultures all over the world.

I'm not proud of what Britain did to obtain and then hold its overseas territories, but claiming English would be as important as *Portuguese* were it not for America sounds ludicrous, even on the face of it.

There are usually a bunch of solicitors int he court houses who're between courts and happy to give some advice on these things. if you can peak thier interest they may even just come into court to make your arguement for you... Asssuming you have a good one prepared and the evidence to back it up that would be the cheapest way to go.

Basicly need more info. Specifically the section of the act your'e charged under... once I know that i can describe how you commit the offence and you can see if it meets with your recallection.

You said you filled out a form for the guard, do you remember what it said and if you signed it?

Obviously if they have a signed confession then they could honestly believe offering an administrative fine is a good deal for you. You need to inform them in a way they recignise can't be a trick.

Get the following.

A recipt for payment, try the invoice for the card you bought the ticket on. This indicates that you payed with your card in your name.

An itemized recipt indicating what was purchased, the ticket vendor sent you an e-mail with an invoice. This indicates that you were paying for tavel on that day between the destinations.

The ticket itself, the number on the ticket is good too, but this indicates a COMPLETE circle of paying for and reiceiving.

You may want to retain the services of an office for this. Solicitors usually notarise things for a small fee and then provide certified copies to you, some will also do admin work, draft a cover letter and send and recieve mail for very little. 

Work on what you can afford, if a photocopy and reused envelope is the best you get then ring their office to tell them to expect the package and indicate that they're to ring you upon recipt of it in the package. Call then in 3-5 days if you don't hear from them.

If this is the case then the contract makes the law, no matter what they say to the contrary you have thier agreement secured by your possesion of a recipt for travel on that date, between those locations. The rest is meaningless but until you set the record straight they won't recongise this.

The lightsaber in Star Wars is cribbed from Excalibur, Caladcholg, Hrunting, and thousands more magic swords passed down to legendary heroes. The wise old man, as a story telling meme, predates Doctor Who by several centuries. The time machine originated with HG Wells, although the police box motif is clever.

I'm not going to suggest that they should try to be more like London. That's pathetic. It's only really small minded people that have an issue with this, because if you think about it logically, it's not an issue. We do all share a culture. And then everyone shares a bit more on top of that to add to the culture of the city, which in turn will become part of the culture in future. I really don't understand this homogenous, single race society you advocate. It seems rather peculiar to me that you seem to think that people of different ethnicities are fundamentally different. They're not. We are just human beings. Some drink tea, others drink saki. I'll admit there are probably segragated towns in Bradford and the likes, but this is mainly issues with Pakistani/Bangladeshi communities.

true,djhworld,uk,London/Nottingham,"Personally I think this is a good idea, Cambridge and Oxford are the best universities we have and are constantly trying to keep up with the Ivy League in terms of reputation and academic prowess. 

They need to charge these amounts of money to maintain the 'tutorial' system and the ever increasing cost of maintaining the extraordinary buildings that house the students and ensure facilities are top notch.

My only concern is how they're going to make this system fair. Charging £9,000 a year to a rich family is fine (it's a steal for them in comparison to the £27,000 a year cost of Eton) but I'm worried how they're going to support the middle and lower classes who might be put off the idea due to financial concerns. I only hope that they will put a system in that allocates bursaries and support grants in **for the right people who are bright but not financially able**

I wasn't clever enough to go to Oxbridge and I never will be, but if I was I'd want the best education I could possibly get and if that means paying £9k a year then so be it **your education is the best investment you can make**

Although, saying all this, I was fortunate enough to go to university one year before the ""top up fees"" system came into place, so I only had to pay £1150 a year (which the taxpayer picked up the bill for - in reality my parents very kindly fronted up the £200 a year actual cost) so I'm a little out of the loop. I can see why young people might be daunted by the colossal debt that could be imposed against them. 

Actually, I think the biggest crime in all these tuition fee debates is the total lack of discussion about **actual** debt. £27,000 is the ballpark figure for tuition fee debt, but this doesn't take into account the student loan system which many students rely to meet the living costs while away from home. I'm not sure what the figure for the 'maximum' loan is nowadays, probably £5k a year?

a) You don't have to pay upfront. 

b) You only pay it back if you earn over a certain amount of money per year.

c) If you're poor, go to uni, remain poor, you'll end up paying nothing much at all. 

d) Hence: you should probably only go to university if a) you want to get a good education in order to get a good job, b) you want to get a good education because you absolutely love learning and everything there is to do with discovery of knowledge, or c) you want to go learn something interesting but have some fall-back position you can use. Don't go to university if you just want to slack off for a few years and get pissed every night with your mates. You'll be wasting your own time and everyone else's. 


disclaimer: I'm an academic (non-UK but working in the UK now) and honestly think that university isn't for everyone. Anyone *ought* to be able to go, but honestly not everyone is cut out for it. And it's really just sad to see some students scraping through all their classes and having to come beg for marks when it's obvious that they just don't have their heart in it or couldn't be bothered doing the work for it. Maybe having the £9k hanging over these students that still want to come to uni might help them take it more seriously?

As well as that, Cambridge gives me another grant which is a hell of a lot more than I'd receive anywhere else. The bursary system here is very fucking generous, and because of that, it's worked out a lot cheaper for me than any other uni would have.

- There are A LOT of people in exactly the same position as me, and who are very grateful for the financial help.

- Cambridge gives out a metric fuckton of money. Along with the normal grants, there are numerous ways of getting money if you need it. They prevent any home student from dropping out for financial reasons. I don't think the fees rise is going to hit those who come to Cambridge particularly. It will hit those going to unis who charge high fees but don't have as strong a bursary system.

But what about the English people that were living there already? Does it matter if their home town feels foreign? I'm just offering that as a possibility of why people might have issues. We can't all be post modern urban hipsters that take their ethnicity as serious as they take their fast food and pop music. Or at least as they think they take it.


&gt; Liverpool feels foreign to me. I don't have a problem with it. It gives it it's identity. 

Are you saying you'd feel just as home in Liverpool, Buenos Aires or Oklahoma City?

But this isn't about you its about any general population.

&gt; We do all share a culture. And then everyone shares a bit more on top of that to add to the culture of the city, which in turn will become part of the culture in future. 

I'm not sure about that additive model. Sure they can merge, conflict and very but why do cultures remain intact all over the world despite close contact? 

&gt; I really don't understand this homogenous, single race society you advocate. It seems rather peculiar to me that you seem to think that people of different ethnicities are fundamentally different. They're not. 

I think culture matters and they are different. You can't treat it like a consumerist choice. Its not like that.

&gt;We are just human beings. Some drink tea, others drink saki. 

There you go again with a shallow differentiation. Ethnicity is not about what label of designer jeans you choose to wear.

&gt;I'll admit there are probably segragated towns in Bradford and the likes, but this is mainly issues with Pakistani/Bangladeshi communities. 

And why does that not matter?

&gt; You say it's wrong that a place some people call home might feel foreign. That's a bit silly. Not everywhere in your country is home. There are going to be places in your country that are not the same as your home town.

But this is about rapid change. When people feel like they no longer recognise their home town.

I'm not advocating a single culture. I have no idea how that would even be imposed. I'm just pointing at things that might a problem.

These places do not have the kind of bursary system that Cambridge and Oxford do. Your university is *incredibly* wealthy compared to any of the others. All the other universities which try to compete with Oxbridge will feel that they have to charge the same because those that don't will appear to be offering an inferior education. 

You can bet Durham, LSE, Imperial, Newcastle, Birmingham, Bristol, York, St Andrews etc are all going to be charging the full amount now. These places cannot afford anywhere *near* the bursary system that Oxbridge colleges can.

Then you'll have the non-top 10 kind of Universities also wanting to do the same if they want to  appear to be competing with the top tier.

There's no incentive for Universities not to charge the top amount, so why should they bother?

The sad thing is that Cambridge has so much money that it could easily afford not to charge the full amount and have a knock on effect to the other Universities. ""We don't have to charge our students so much, why do you?"".

I think this was a sad, cynical decision for all the other students in the country.",0,1297203033,null,0,false,0,c1g1bgn,t3_fhge6,t1_c1g1bgn,t1_c1fziim,1426751125,5,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,5

Not exactly as I found out.

You are screwed if one of the students in your flat drops out and becomes unemployed. The flat becomes liable as a whole and each is responsible for their share of the tax. The end result was that the unemployed person was able to claim benefit on their 'share'. The students were ineligible for benefit because they weren't liable.

Personally, I'd recommend going back to Series 1 (from 2005, so the first series of the show since its revival; really, it's the 27th season, but we'll ignore that) and starting with Christopher Eccleston's Ninth Doctor and Rose.  Then continue to series 2, 3, 4, and the Specials (The Next Doctor, Planet of the Dead, The Waters of Mars, and The End of Time) before watching Series 5.

It's not 100% required - I have several friends who've only watched from Series 5 onward - but I think it's much more rewarding to watch Eccleston and David Tennant before watching Matt Smith.

Also, Series 1-4 and the Specials are all available on Netflix Instant Watch!

If you want to skim through S1-4 without watching every episode, here's what I recommend (you may miss some things along the way, but you can always go back and rewatch the whole thing later):

**Series 1**

* 1x01 - ""Rose""
* 1x02 - ""The End of the World""
* 1x06 - ""Dalek""
* 1x07 - ""The Long Game""
* 1x08 - ""Father's Day""
* 1x09/1x10 - ""The Empty Child""/""The Doctor Dances"" (2-parter)
* 1x12/1x13 - ""Bad Wolf""/""The Parting of the Ways""

**Series 2**

* The 2005 ""Children in Need"" Special (bridges S1 and S2, available on YouTube)
* 2x00 ""The Christmas Invasion"" (2005 Christmas Special)
* 2x01 ""New Earth""
* 2x02 ""Tooth and Claw""
* 2x03 ""School Reunion""
* 2x05/2x06 ""Rise of the Cybermen""/""The Age of Steel""
* 2x08/2x09 ""The Impossible Planet""/""The Satan Pit""
* 2x12/2x13 ""Army of Ghosts""/""Doomsday""

**Series 3**

* 3x00 ""The Runaway Bride"" (2006 Christmas Special)
* 3x01 ""Smith and Jones""
* 3x03 ""Gridlock""
* 3x06 ""The Lazarus Experiment""
* 3x10 ""Blink""
* 3x11/3x12/3x13 ""Utopia""/""The Sound of Drums""/""Last of the Time Lords""

**Series 4**

* 4x00 ""Voyage of the Damned"" (2007 Christmas Special - this is actually pretty skippable, but it resolves the 3x13 cliffhanger, and it gets referenced later on)
* 4x01 ""Partners in Crime""
* 4x03 ""Planet of the Ood""
* 4x04/4x05 ""The Sontaran Stratagem""/""The Poison Sky""
* 4x06 ""The Doctor's Daughter (again, very skippable, but it resolves the 4x05 cliffhanger, and it's possible that this episode might become important in future seasons)
* 4x08/4x09 ""Silence in the Library""/""Forest of the Dead"" **(I highly recommend watching at least these two episodes before you watch any of Series 5)**
* 4x11/4x12/4x13 ""Turn Left""/""The Stolen Earth""/""Journey's End""

**Specials** (there wasn't a full series in 2009, due to David Tennant's limited availability, so instead there were five specials throughout the year)

* S01 ""The Next Doctor"" (2008 Christmas Special; potentially skippable, but this one gets directly referenced in Series 5)
* S03 ""The Waters of Mars"" (2009 November Special)
* S04/S05 ""The End of Time, Part 1"" (2009 Christmas Special)/""The End of Time, Part 2"" (2010 New Year's Day Special) **(This two-parter is immensely important, as it is the transition from David Tennant to Matt Smith - you don't *need* to watch it to ""get"" Series 5, but the first scene of 5x01 will make more sense if you've seen it)**

**Series 5**

* Everything!  Since that's why I made this list - to include every episode that is of direct importance to Series 5, so you can watch all of series 5 without having seen all of 1-4.

**Series 6**

* 6x00 ""A Christmas Carol"" (2010 Christmas Special) *(obviously, this is the only part of Series 6 that has aired thus far)*

----------------

**Again** - it's not essential that you see all of these episodes prior to seeing Series 6.

My girlfriend, a Doctor Who fan, had a birthday party, so I thought it would be a nice idea if as many guests as possible brought a Doctor Who Cubeecraft as an additional gift. Although it wasn't easy for some of them (not really knowing the show and/or having no crafting talent) they did their best - and the results can be seen in the linked image.

If you take a close look, you'll see some crafting errors. For instance, K9's head is screwed on the wrong way (although that could be excused - as a robot he's able to turn his head at least 180 degrees, right?), some hair is not standing up (11th Doctor and Amy, for instance - same goes for the Ood's tentacles, although he's hiding behind the 10th Doctor), and so on.

I hope you like the picture, and maybe you'll do something similar - it's a great collaborative gift for any Whovian.

Having met gypsies, or dealt with them, it would appear as though they don't give a shit about anyone but themselves. When I was a kid they would quite often turn up on our park, fill the place with trash and sewage, start big fires on the grass, their kids would start fights with the local kids and petty crime rates would sky rocket. Things like cars being vandalized and stolen from, bins being set on fire, shoplifting etc. When they left, the park was a shit tip and the council had to sort everything out. Near my Dads old place, which was out in the countryside, gypsies would arrive nearby towards the end of summer, and within a week or 2, someone on my Dads street would be robbed.

So the reason people don't tend to like gypsies that much is because they have a very different culture, and often their arrival seems to herald a mini-crime wave.

From personal experience, in school the pikey kids used to masturbate in class and cause all sorts of trouble with drugs, etc. and they used to set up camps on the green areas, trashing the area and mugging people at night.

true,bowling4meth,english,Straight out of Surrey,"The problem with graduates nowadays is a combination of too many graduates (as a result of more people going to uni), the dumbing down of degrees (believe me, I've seen this way too much - people aren't being taught useful things at a lot of unis) and the promotion of the myth that you'll get a good job after leaving uni.

The first one is a case of supply and demand. There's too many grads, not enough jobs. That's fairly straightforward for many job sectors.

The dumbing down of degrees is the worst thing I've seen. We've stopped recruiting graduates because it's too painful to interview endless people who clearly wants a job but hasn't a hope in hell of having the skills necessary because the closest they get to real CS in a CS degree is ""a module on java and I read a bit about how a compiler works but can't remember it"".

The myth that anyone leaving uni will get a better job than someone that didn't go is finally being busted. Finishing uni only removes barriers where an undergraduate degree is required, and the number of jobs for that decreases as you get older. By the time you're 30 in many cases nobody gives a shit if you have a degree or not, yet you probably spent 4 years of life getting one (6 if you include your A Levels as part of the path).

Everyone I know assumes I have at least one undergraduate degree, when in actual fact I flunked college. For students that want to get into jobs, instead of wasting your time trying to show how great a graduate you are you need to demonstrate your capabilities.

I can only give you examples from what my brother and I have gone through. Most graduate schemes will have several stages you go through before they bring you to interview. This can be online tests or assessment centres, or even a phone interview. For example, I applied for the GCHQ scheme. Their process involved a maths test, a verbal reasoning test, a personality test, a phone interview, an assessment centre and personal interview, a drugs test and probably a re-take of the online tests. I failed the maths test. It was probably a good thing in hindsight as I would have failed the drugs test later on, on account of the terribly strong painkillers I have to take.

My brother applied for many jobs where he got randomly rejected at the online test stage. He got 2 interviews. For the job he was eventually offered he had to attend something at his university, then go to a formal dinner with the company, then go to London where he had an entire day of interviews (like 9 in total) where they asked stupid questions like 'tell us how many flights go from london to new york every day and where we can make money on it', and then was made to do another dinner. 

I understand that there are hundreds of applicants for every vacancy, but the process they put you through is basically a meat grinder.

true,TOMMYBO0,null,null,"Hello all, 

This is my first post in this subreddit and something that I have quite a bit of experience about...

First off, my Dad is a farmer in North Yorkshire, however I had no opinion towards them either way. I went to school with a few of them and counted some as friends. 

Anyway I will cut to a brief shortened version of my experiences. I remember been young and my them calling to the farm asking for scrap, oil, coal or even farm produce. My Dad used to give willingly anything he didn't need.

One day instead of a single van turning up, a fleet appeared from nowhere. They parked up, and started draining the red diesel tanks, my Dad went out to confronted them, they floored it and left. The police later found the diesel in a tank on their camp and the number plates of the vans involved were all present.

A week later another visit from a fellow gypsie, asking to have some red diesel, my Dad declined stating that he felt betrayed that they had tried to steal from him. He was then told that they would cause problems for him and his livestock, until he allowed them to take some.

What followed included; glass placed in all of the animal water troughs, fencing sawed down (tools left at the scene) and animals literally herded on a main road with a 60mph speed limit - an accident sadly occurred, for which my Dad was liable. Had our house windows shot at, 300 straw bails burned, burgled twice and our stuff found at the camp... these are some of the few.

How do I know this was all caused by them... I don't for sure, however the day after every incident one of their vans would pull into the yard and they would drop a card through the door with a name and a phone number on, to see if my Dad wanted to talk to them.

The police were helpless... With no permanent addresses, ID, ownership of the vehicles etc they were powerless.

Certain members of the village did unfortunately decide to take there own justice. I want to stress though no-one in my family was ever involved and it has certainly made the situation worse.

In conclusion, I wouldn't pre-judge anyone, even with what has happened. What it boils down to, or from my experience, is the fact 'home owners'??? or the general public hate the idea that gypsies avoiding paying council tax, car insurance and everything else, HOWEVER are first in line to go to the doctors to get free health care, glasses on the NHS etc... Even when a lot of them are on a comfortable wage and live in a permanent house like you or I.

I hope that my comment reads fairly well, it was speed typed on a break at work. If anyone has any questions or would like some further information I will be happy to oblige.

true,lenbeydon,eng-gloucestershire,Gloucestershire,"Without exception my interactions with, and direct observations, of Gypsies is overwhelmingly negative. My father works for the local County Council. The Council spent lots of money on setting up official Gypsy camp sites that included shower and toilet blocks. Within a year the sites were totally vandalised and destroyed by them. The place was covered with rubbish and excrement. The Gypsies had even dug the copper water pipes out of the ground.
In our local town Gypsies bought a field ( through intermediaries) on the outskirts. It is Greenbelt land http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_belt   and planning laws are very strict to prevent unauthorised building.  Despite only having permission to graze horses there, as soon as they were given an electricity connection for the 'Horse Shelter' a whole community of 20 + caravans arrived and have been there ever since. The once green field has now been crudely tarmaced or covered with gravel, as well as rubbish and excrement.

Personally, i was the manager of a Pizza place. When out delivering leaflets I called into the main Gypsy site in the city. I asked the Chief Gyppo would it be OK to give everyone a delivery menu. He was very friendly and touched as none of the other takeaways had ever approached them before'.

A couple of days later had a call for a delivery. I took the order out personally, and as it was quite late I parked at the entrance gates so as not to drive round the camp in my diesel van and wake anyone up. I delivered the pizza on foot, returned to my van and started to drive away. Thunk, Thunk, Thunk, Oh Dear, two tyres on the van had been slashed by the Gypsy kids hanging around.

So fuck 'em. If they paid taxes, didnt commit crime and obeyed planning laws like the rest of us have to then I would give them more of a chance.  But it seems like they only want to take, and not contribute. The old Romany traditions of horsedrawn wagons and moving with seasonal farmwork has totally disappeared.
Now it is SUVs, static caravans with sattelite TV, illegal encampments, crime and rubbish.

Absolutely not! I am looking at them as a person, not as a degree certificate.

I've never asked 'how many golfballs can you fit in a plane', but I have asked someone to tell me how much money the London Eye takes in on an average Saturday (usually when I'm really struggling to engage the person in a normal way). That tells me if they're the kind of person who can be pragmatic and be logical in coming to 'an answer'. Most times when I've asked it, the answer I get is ""oh, I've no idea"".

&gt; You just want to see if they fit into some sort of arbitary 'mindset' you've created.

It's not arbitrary. Arbitrary would be to hire anybody based upon academic qualification alone. It wouldn't just be arbitrary, it would be disastrous. I need to find people who can work in a team, can reason pragmatically, are able to articulate a business plan to solve a problem they are faced with. I need someone who can communicate well, and isn't too shy. I also need someone who isn't a loudmouth and tries to take over the room. It's quite a fine balance. 

An interview is the chance to 'sell' yourself ; many graduates get the wrong end of the stick and think it's the companies who should be queueing up to buy them. It's the interviewee that needs to convince the interviewer to hire them. It's just not borne out by the figures.

true,sionnach,irish,Filthy foreigner,"&gt; Everyone I know who has gone through such a process as a candidate, successful or not, thinks there is a huge random element.

It may **seem** random - and I can't say that the system is flawless, but in most of these schemes (I can only speak of those I have been involved in or know about) consensus to hire someone has to be reached by quite a few people and through scoring mechanisms. In the case of where I worked, someone would have to score 3 out of 5 in every element, in which case they got an offer. 2/5 in any one, and you were out (I argued against this repeatedly - if someone was a star all-round but with one explainable and workable problem, we should still have hired. Actually, if this really was the case we'd just fudge the numbers). Perhaps that's why it can seem random ... but it's anything but. You are entitled to see all of the interview notes, scores and other information that was written down about you so large employers are very careful to make sure everything and every decision is backed up with evidence.

&gt; Whether the things you said in the earlier assessments (in the case of big recruitment schemes that go in several stages) stood out to the assessor and got you on to a further interview.

Well, if you say something that stands out (so long as it is good!) it's a pretty good reason for the recruiter to put you through. As for the communication that happens between interview rounds - I'm afraid it's just a few moments scanning the front page of the previous interview notes. Usually this is just pointing the subsequent interviewer for areas of strength / weakness worth exploring.  

&gt; I'm sure in your career you want to make it as exact a science as possible

Kind of. There are intangibles, such as ""will this person fit within company culture"" which are really important, and are scored, but are far from an exact science.

&gt; but the fact is that with a high ratio of applicants to positions, you can discard a proportion of good candidates by accident

Yes - this does happen. In my previous firm, they required a certain level of GCSE results. I thought this was preposterous ... and no doubt we screened people who would have otherwise been good.

&gt; So it can be extremely hard to tell whether your selection process is optimal or not

It doesn't need to be optimal. It just needs to be good. We wanted to hire smart people that we could teach in the ways of our industry. It's one of the reasons why we'd accept people from **any** degree background, even though the subject matter (business consulting) would lead you to believe that we would only look for a certain degree type.

Last thought on the ""randomness"" - people coming out of an interview rarely tell their friends that they did a shit interview even though they know they blew it. It's easier to say ""no idea"" why they didn't get through to the next round.

I found most of the posts on Reddit pretty shock...ing. I 've never really met a traveller I don't think, but I've certainly come across plenty of people in our society who behave like this so called traveller stereotype every Friday night - smearing shit across toilets, spewing on the pavement, tossing beer bottles and kebab boxes in the road, travelling in gangs... fighting, stabbing, stealing.. leering and shouting at women... raping women often enough. We somehow have this opinion of own society that we create no rubbish, never steal, never piss in public, never mistreat animals (teh majority of our food and clothing of course comes from deeply unethical sources), never sponge off the tax payer, never steal from the tax payer (even the pillars of our society - MP's? Bankers? Army Generals?)... The reality is we just have a very organised and official system that deals with all the shit we create - sending our electrical trash off to places like China so they can get the cancers from burning it, burying the miles of unnecessary plastic shit we go through underground, etc, etc. Our destruction is just better masked. I also found it interesting when watching the programme that when they asked one of the gyrating little girls where she learned her dance moves she said from ""Rhianna and Shakira"". OUR society are responsible for the early sexualisation of children - the travellers only ever learned it from us, and actually our society is far more promiscuious than theirs. I could go on for a long time about all the terrible things our society does and the deep impact it has on the entire world - wars we start, pollution we create, countries we fuck over. I don't know a lot about the traveller/gypsy society, but I know enough about ours to think we have a cheek to critisize theirs with such sweeping generalisations, and I find it frightening that this is the attitude of the majority of people on a so called 'very left wing chat forum'. And just as an aside, my dad has done a lot of work on documenting travelling people in Scotland - a very proud, ancient and fascinating people, who have been equally ostracized and criticized. There is no other group of people we would talk about so openly in such derogatory and prejudicial terms. Maybe some of them are cunts, and they cause trouble and bully and start fights and steal... but not ALL of them do. Just like not ALL of us behave like dicks every Friday night. I was just about crying watching the girl last week who was leaving her arthritic mother to get married, and I thought most of the girls came across as sweet and hard working.

true,sionnach,irish,Filthy foreigner,"&gt; What it sounded like was that you aren't interested in the person - as in you don't care what they've spent 3 or 4 years of their life doing - but you want them to fit the 'culture' of whatever company you work for. They don't know the culture.

Maybe I didn't explain very well. I guess it more about weeding out the kind of person we **don't** want ... the overconfident ... the meek ... the really smart but inarticulate. And to be honest, you're right - big recruiters don't really care what you've spent 3 or 4 years of your life doing. You wouldn't believe the amount of people who go into describing just how their final year project worked -- I don't care! I'm more interested in how you solved the difficulties that came your way... not what the difficulties (or solutions) were, but *how* they were approached.

&gt; Someone could interview very well but then you could decide not to hire them because they exhibited X personality trait and Joe from IT already has that.

When you're in the business of hiring several hundred graduates a year, you can play the numbers game. You know some people you hire will be duds, and some will be great. You know you've missed some gems, but you've got some too. 

&gt; It's completely stupid making people go through the process of applying with qualifications and taking silly tests if what determines wether they get the job or not is just the recruiters gut instinct.

Most business decisions are based off gut instinct, and the numbers / scores are made to fit with that instinct. When you have someone recruited who has to get the nod from 6 different recruiters, and all six guts (who have been doing this for quite some time) agree, you generally find that those guts are pretty good indicators.

The deeper problem is this, I guess: we tax progressively (that is, at higher rates for the richer) out of some sense of social equality, and also because we believe that the rich can afford to pay more for public services. Given that, the extra £60k paid in in tax isn't supposed to pay for uni - it's the contribution that that richer person would have had to pay, regardless of how he came to earn the extra £300k. His education is therefore still unpaid for.

If we're saying the extra income tax should go towards that person's education, we are saying that richer people don't owe the state more simply by virtue of being rich, i.e. challenging the very notion of a progressive tax. 

I do actually have reservations about a progressive income tax, but I'm pretty sure it's here to stay in the UK. Anyway, if you do believe in a progressive income tax, that's a problem for your argument.

In my opinion, no that wouldn't be better.  However, I only get downvoted on Reddit when I try to argue philosophy, so I'm willing to tentatively accept your premise.

Therefore, let's say we do that.  My company literally can't find people to hire in our UK offices.  We end up importing software engineers from other countries: I was brought over from America, and of the 20 engineers in my line of sight, I think 5 may have been born in the UK.

So you want to distribute the means of production?  Fine, point me to some top-tier UK computer programmers looking for work.  We have openings.

But maybe ""top-tier"" kind of violates your goal...is that you want all programmers to be given jobs, whether they're any good or not?  Which projects do you want them assigned to?  Do you really want them working on core internet services or medical imaging systems or aircraft design if they're not, honestly, very good at their job?

You use words like ""human potential"" and ""meaningful work"", but I don't know what those mean in reality.  All I know is that everyone in the UK seems to want to major in ""communications"" or ""media"" or psychology or marketing and don't seem to want to do advanced maths or sciences.  That's why we don't hire them, and I'm pretty sure this would apply to all the other international engineering firms I've worked for in the past.

Going ""to university"" isn't enough.  You have to pick a specialty that's *in demand*.  If your field is not in demand, then you're going to have trouble finding employment.  It's disingenuous to say ""there aren't enough jobs.""  Britain wouldn't be importing so many Tier-1 / HSMP skilled workers if that was true.  The reality is that the jobs aren't ones which you want (or are able) to do.  Unfortunately, that *is* the ""means of production"" which you reference, and that *is* the result of the ""benefits of automation"" which you claim.  A technical, automated economy requires technical expertise to maintain and develop new systems.

And that's one huge color / dimension missing from the OP's Venn diagram: it's treating all graduates the same, regardless of what field they entered.  That's simply not the case, and it misrepresents at least one significant driver in the problem which you're trying to solve.

I used to be a self employed IT person - I was employed by a successful roma business person who had settled. I was always treated very curteously, was always paid on time and my work was respected. When I went back to full time employment I was sorry to stop working for that business. He and his son generally didn't discuss their origin to avoid the common prejudice - didn't know anything about it until I had worked for him for about a year.

When I was growing up, one of my best friends was roma - again settled a generation before her. She was very bright and kind, went to the best local grammar school (had to pass entrance exam but state run) and became a social worker for womens issues and married a fireman last time I saw her. Again - you wouldn't have a clue she was from a travelling family unless you got to know her.

Seems like a lot of racism here - haters got to hate. Of course there are bad things to report - if you looked at any impoverished, excluded group, I suspect you find the same. But I bet its hard to find a more impoverished, excluded group for so long as the Roma.

Well people would work in what they are suited to work in, and educated and trained to do so. So no, clearly people shouldn't be given responsibilities they are incapable of fulfilling.

But the subtle point you make here is that you don't think the others deserve jobs. But a livelihood is required to survive in the current system, it seems absurd to suggest that some do not deserve the necessities of life, simply because they may not be the best in their field. We can't just abandon people like that.

&gt;All I know is that everyone in the UK seems to want to major in ""communications"" or ""media"" or psychology or marketing and don't seem to want to do advanced maths or sciences.

I'm studying Physics, and quite honestly the employment prospects could well be better in Media Studies or Psychology. We have too many graduates for too few jobs in all areas.

&gt; Unfortunately, that is the ""means of production"" which you reference, and that is the result of the ""benefits of automation"" which you claim.

No, it's the result of the private ownership of the means of production. Which means we still must find work to afford the necessities of life (even when we can produce them in abundance), rather than using the automation and high supply of labour to relieve the work burden on all.

&gt;And that's one huge color / dimension missing from the OP's Venn diagram: it's treating all graduates the same, regardless of what field they entered. That's simply not the case, and it misrepresents at least one significant driver in the problem which you're trying to solve.

Well I agree with you, though as mentioned before, the unemployment is just as bad in Physics as other areas. But really I was making a broader point than just about graduate employment, we have a system that relies on the majority finding employment to survive, and yet automation is ever increasing and reducing the demand for labour which results in increased competition for the remaining jobs and so worsening wages and working conditions, rather than being used for the benefit of all.

This leads to a great waste in human potential when we leave trained and educated people to waste their skills working in whatever job they can find, whilst many others are left unemployed entirely. This great waste of labour is shown most greatly in the sweatshops of the Far East, where people are condemned to waste their entire lives doing work that could easily be automated, simply because it is more profitable to use cheap labour.

It really makes no sense, we should focus on automating the work that it is possible to automate, so that we can relieve people from such labour and increase our productivity in areas where human labour is truly required.",0,1297279027,null,0,false,0,c1g44s6,t3_fhy3v,t1_c1g44s6,t1_c1g3zaq,1426903413,4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,4

I like to think I'm a good employee for anyone who'd be willing to spend some time to understand that I'm not talkative until I feel comfortable.

When it comes to competency based questions, I don't really think I shine. There's too big a focus on 'awkward' moments or confrontations, which I strive to avoid by being thorough before undertaking any work-related task. 

I once temped in an office, for example, that handled paperwork for mortgages and stuff. Lots of legal paperwork. The office manager wanted me to answer the phone without any training on what the department did or where folders were as I was simply filing paperwork and I was taking messages. Most times, the guy on the other end of the phone would ask me why I answered it if I couldn't do anything, since the office had a voicemail service he would normally leave messages on.

In those situations, I'm not exactly sure how I can sell myself. There's certainly some experience there, but it's all built on negative experiences and I wouldn't want to abuse any employer.

It really is hard to sell myself based on what I've learned from negative experiences which my nature compels me to avoid as much as possible by covering anything that could generally go wrong before it happens so as to avoid it happening. 
Problem is, that approach doesn't sell myself either...

The problem is that the police aren't effective since it is incredibly difficult to prosecute them when they have no permanent address, can leave as quickly as they arrived and won't show up to court, etc. and how do you find the individuals responsible for trashing the area after they have left? I agree with the principle of pursuing individuals, but in practice it isn't really possible, if the travellers want the privilege of being permitted to stay in areas, etc. then they should expel the criminal elements themselves.

&gt;You are correct that children should have to attend school but sending in the armed police is not a reasonable or just reaction. 

I was more meaning that the local police are often, understandably, reluctant to enter the camps and deal with the situation due to the hostility they present. It isn't really something local police forces are equipped to deal with.

Why should we have to accept every way of life and ""culture""? If a way of life results in trespass, damage and anti-social behaviour then it should not be accepted.

We have tried giving them camps and land to stay on, and they show just as much disrespect as before, meanwhile it costs local councils and police forces a fortune. It isn't fair for the normal citizens who live within the law and work hard, to then have to pay for these criminals, and even accommodate them in their communities with the enforced campsites, etc.

I don't see why our society should have to put up with it. France has already shown that with enough political will some headway can be made towards addressing the problem. They have made it clear that they will make no attempts to integrate or reconcile with society, and so forced integration and the full employment of the law is the only remaining solution.

&gt; the subtle point you make here is that you don't think the others deserve jobs

Your inference is correct: ""deserve"" is not a word which often crosses my lips (or mind)...I group it with the rest of the [deontic subjunctives](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deontic_modality), words pertaining to alternative universes in which things work differently than Earth Prime.  I do enjoy fantasy and speculation and even moral discourses on how we ""ought"" to act versus how we do; but in conversations about what *is*, and the realpolitik of what is actually achievable, I usually leave those at the doorstep :-(

(I'm not trying to claim that's a good thing, for the record)

&gt; it seems absurd to suggest that some do not deserve the necessities of life, simply because they may not be the best in their field. We can't just abandon people

Speaking of ""absurd,"" surely you're not suggesting that British unemployed university graduates fail to receive the ""necessities of life""?  I pay my council tax, and walking through Chalvey can see very clearly what is given out every day to those who are neither employed nor educated.

I don't mean to misrepresent your statement out of context, but nor was it my intent to condemn the 3 billion humans with IQ's below 100 to starvation and misery.  So just to be clear: I wasn't suggesting anybody should be deprived of ""the necessities of life.""  However, it's a big jump from there to simply ""creating"" appropriately scaled jobs (in quantity, complexity, sustainability, and affordability).   [more after the jump]

&gt; condemn many people to unemployment or menial labour that could be automated

See, this is where it gets tricky, and I'm dearly interested in how to solve this because I'm part of the problem.

You talk about automating menial jobs (""where people are condemned to waste their entire lives"").  Well, I do that.  I have contributed directly to automating thousands of menial jobs of out existence.  In the last 2 years, I've seen at least 5 shops close on High Street in my town in fairly direct results of my efforts, and those of my teammates and company.  I made myself visit each and every one, and talk (anonymously) to the staff being displaced.  In general, they weren't thrilled about the result.  They weren't excited about the newly freed time they'd have to study the classics and ponder deeper more meaningful questions about life and the universe; they were despondent about how they were going to buy anything for their kids this Christmas (or certainly next).

I'm not disagreeing with you: I agree that we (as a people, a country, a civilization and a culture) need to maintain a level of reasonable, productive employment for people.  ""Employment"" both in the sense of dignified wage-earning, and in the sense of ""keeping busy in an organized, structured activity"".  I'm actually not an elitist: I used to teach ""vocational"", trade-oriented courses (my son tells me they're just called ""tech"" here), both at secondary and adult levels.  People want to be productive, and they want to contribute: most people don't actually want or enjoy ""leeching"" off the dole.  (I say ""most"" because I want to believe it, although some days I wonder.)

However, it grows increasingly hard to maintain such roles.  Last year we made an entire team in our group ""redundant"", partly because knowledge-workers like me successfully ""automated"" their menial, repetitive tasks out of existence (it's sad when you really *can* be replaced with a Perl script).  Should we have done that differently?  I don't know, but I can definitely say that most Reddit users are benefiting by slightly lower prices because of it.

This is why I feel deeply torn by your twin demands for (1) greater automation of menial tasks, and (2) more jobs for people of middling education and expertise.  I honestly don't know how to do both at the same time.  And I really, really want to, because (a) automating menial tasks is my particular speciality, and (b) I feel badly for all the people thus deprived of their job.

&gt; so that we can relieve people from such labour and increase our productivity in areas where human labour is truly required

You're going to have to fill this one in for me.  Which areas are they, and how are we going to transition displaced shop-clerks and stockboys to adequately meet them?

Doctor's Mom:

One of the two dissident Time Lords, described as ""The Woman"" in the credits, visits Wilfred on several occasions, appearing and disappearing in unexplained ways. When she lowers her arms to stare at the Tenth Doctor he appears to recognise her, but when later asked by Wilfred about her identity, the Doctor evades the question. British newspapers The Daily Telegraph and The Daily Mail identified the character as the Doctor's mother as early as April 2009.[8][9] Russell T.

true,[deleted],null,null,"Well, within the current economic system, you are correct, increasing automation just increases unemployment and the struggle for employment in other areas.

However, that is what has to change, by collectivising the means of production so that the products of our society are shared by all. I support this ""Technological Socialism"" where we focus on automating as much work as possible whilst sharing the benefits, so that those made unemployed can be freely educated to contribute usefully elsewhere, and the necessities of life can be provided for all.

This way we no longer need this system of overwork for some and unemployment for others, for there is no longer the need to exploit the maximum profit out of each employee. Instead we can focus on training everyone to perform useful labour, to fully maximise our productivity.

As Einstein wrote in _Society and Personality_ in _The World As I See It_:

&gt; But the development of machinery means that less and less work is needed from the individual for the satisfaction of the community's needs. A planned division of labour is becoming more and more of a crying necessity, and this division will lead to the material security of the individual. This security and the spare time and energy which the individual will have at his command can be made to further his development. In this way the community may regain its health, and we will hope that future historians will explain the morbid symptoms of present-day society as the childhood ailments of an aspiring humanity, due entirely to the excessive speed at which civilization was advancing.

Of course, when we remove the typical employer-employee relationship by collectivising the means of production then it is no longer a simple matter to set wages. However, I think we should seek to abolish the wage and monetary system entirely, instead providing all people with an equal and abundant number of credits with which to purchase the goods produced from society. To balance the work fairly, harder work could be given shorter shifts such that the necessary number of people choose to enter each area of work. Though of course, all of this would take a long time to achieve, the important part is that it gives us a steady way of transitioning to a fully post-scarcity and increasingly automated society, whereas the current system creates artificial scarcity to produce profits in some areas, and fails to automate work when it is cheaper to use sweatshop labour (and even when work is automated it acts against the majority of people).

I once had a candidate who turned up, but had actually been disqualified from the process (for a stupid reason, but that's not important) but she hadn't read the email or listened to the voicemail. She'd travelled a fair distance, so I thought it only fair not to waste her trip. 

I offered to do a mock interview for her, but it was fairly quick that she didn't know the first thing about interviewing and she was, let's say, crap. The job wasn't right for her, in any case. So, we stopped that and did a 1:1 hour on interview training instead. We worked on a couple of simple, but effective answering techniques and getting her to understand what an interviewer is looking to see from a candidate. She got a lot out of it, and a month or two I got a nice email from her thanking me because she got a job and felt some of it was down to being able to interview more confidently.

Einstein was a smart guy, but he didn't get people.

They spend it whacking off, drinking, watching TV, playing Xbox, and — dare I say — surfing the net.  I'm afraid the premise takes a rather sore hit right there.

&gt; we can focus on training everyone to perform useful labour, to fully maximise our productivity

I'm not sure I accept the assumption that maximizing productivity is the correction optimization.  Also, as an ex-teacher, I'm not convinced that you *can* ""train everyone to perform useful labour.""  There are a lot of yobs that haven't the slightest interest in learning a trade; they're disrespectful, short-sighted, selfish, and shallow to the bone, wanting nothing more than a free ride and limitless self-indulgent leisure.  You earlier surmised that I could give a damn whether they lived or died; you were right.

&gt; I think we should seek to abolish the wage and monetary system entirely, instead providing all people with an equal and abundant number of credits with which to purchase the goods produced from society.

And now we're back firmly in subjunctive territory: this is no more realistic a proposition than Rowling's yarns about her boy wizard.  You seem to be assuming that greed, stupidity, envy, resentment, xenophobia, and outright deliberate cruelty can be somehow corrected or cleansed from the human condition, or at least minimized to such minute aberrations that the collective can absorb their rare impact.

They are not.  They are part of the warp and woof of the human condition, as inherent to our function as oxygenation and not likely to be prised away through economic or sociological revolution.  At least, I could be wrong, but our three millennia of recorded history speaks otherwise.

The strength and robustness of capitalism is that it takes the presence of these predilections as *a priori* predicates.  No, it's not a pretty system, and yes it not only permits but actively guarantees unequal, unbalanced outcomes: but (in my opinion) has proven more successful, and helped more people achieve personal and professional success in an environment of political liberty, than any system before it.  In contrast, I strongly suspect your utopian constructed society would self-destruct in short order.

HOWEVER...I am willing to be proven wrong.  You will understand if I do not vote for it until I have have seen a reasonable convincing demonstration at representative scale first.  And I admit, I do not think I would enjoy being a part of such a society.  It might be an improvement for some, but it would almost certainly represent reduced outcomes for me, and my altruism does not run so deep.

I agree with your ""[l]ess action"" comment; if you look carefully in old episodes, you'll most likely find an ""educational bit"" in the script where the Doctor explains something about an ancient civilisation or physics or fossilization or whatever's relevant at the time. Originally, the Doctor's companions were meant to share a similar perspective to that of the viewers, wondering who this strange man was while learning from him.

Occasionally this has been the case in post-2005 episodes, particularly with historical ones such as [Fires of Pompeii](/spoiler), [The Shakespeare Code](/spoiler) or in episodes where historical figures are encountered however, the show is a massive franchise now and feels much more like Saturday-night viewing, if you know what I mean.

Seriously though, I've created [this](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_income_guarantee) wikipedia  page to convince you that I'm not trolling you. 

Cheating is basically impossible because *everybody* receives the same amount. You don't need to apply, you just receive a certain amount of money each month.  

Implementing a basic income guarantee does not mean that you stop raising taxes. It would be financed by taxes. As far as I know there has been some research that showed that the model can be financially valid.

I've heard the claim that nobody would have an incentive to work anymore quite often. However, people would receive a basic income, which ensures that they are able to survive (pay rent, buy food ...). If you want to have nice things you still have to work.

But for the more important point, I don't see why we must remove greed and all the other problems you mention. I mean to quote _The Ragged Trousered Philanthropists_:

&gt; It is not a wild dream of Superhuman Unselfishness. No one will be asked to sacrifice himself for the benefit of others or to love his neighbours better than himself as is the case under the present system, which demands that the majority shall unselfishly be content to labour and live in wretchedness for the benefit of a few. There is no such principle of Philanthropy in Socialism, which simply means that even as all industries are now owned by shareholders, and organized and directed by committees and officers elected by the shareholders, so shall they in future belong to the State, that is, the whole people--and they shall be organized and directed by committees and officers elected by the community.

You also assume that the way people are now is the way they always have been and always will be, but I don't believe this is true. For example, you assume that material concerns are the only motivation for people to work, and yet we know that patriotism and societal pressures can drive people to step up for their society.

If necessary we could always force people to work, it is no different from the current system where the choice is to work or face homelessness and starvation. At least everyone would be guaranteed the opportunity to do so, to quote _Looking Backward_:

&gt; That evening Dr. Leete asked us about our visit to the store, and in the course of the desultory comparison of the ways of the nineteenth century and the twentieth, which followed, something raised the question of inheritance. ""I suppose,"" I said, ""the inheritance of property is not now allowed.""

&gt; ""On the contrary,"" replied Dr. Leete, ""there is no interference with it. In fact, you will find, Mr. West, as you come to know us, that there is far less interference of any sort with personal liberty nowadays than you were accustomed to. We require, indeed, by law that every man shall serve the nation for a fixed period, instead of leaving him his choice, as you did, between working, stealing, or starving. With the exception of this fundamental law, which is, indeed, merely a codification of the law of nature—the edict of Eden—by which it is made equal in its pressure on men, our system depends in no particular upon legislation, but is entirely voluntary, the logical outcome of the operation of human nature under rational conditions. This question of inheritance illustrates just that point. The fact that the nation is the sole capitalist and land-owner of course restricts the individual's possessions to his annual credit, and what personal and household belongings he may have procured with it. His credit, like an annuity in your day, ceases on his death, with the allowance of a fixed sum for funeral expenses. His other possessions he leaves as he pleases.""

But really I think we should focus on addressing the societal issues that produce such people, and this can only be done by addressing the inequality and injustice in the current system.

I really and truly do not believe that ""the people"" have a clue as to how to run an efficient and productive enterprise.  I've worked in both the public and private sector, and I trust my own observations as to which knows how to run a company.

&gt; You also assume that the way people are now is the way they always have been and always will be, but I don't believe this is true.

Then we disagree.  If human nature has changed at all across history, it has been an exceedingly slow and subtle shift, and then only in small movements of statistical tendencies -- the overall spectrum of coverage from extreme to extreme is to all appearances unaltered.

&gt; you assume that material concerns are the only motivation for people to work, and yet we know that patriotism and societal pressures can drive people to step up for their society

I don't assume that's the only motivation, but I do assume it covers 95% of use-cases.  There are certainly people willing to work *pro bono* for nationalism, religion, or other beliefs (many of whom are coincidentally supported through other means).  In any case, they are a small minority and — by definition — have negligible impact on the economy.

&gt; If necessary we could always force people to work

No, see that's the clincher.  You can't.

Sure, you can whip them until they pull a sled or load a trolley or whatever.  But you can't, ever, force them to think.  You can't force them to design, to innovate, to intuit, to invent.  And that is what is needed in a high-tech economy.  The very application of force actively suppresses and deadens brainpower in the spirit of the oppressed.

You know this, surely.

&gt; our system depends in no particular upon legislation, but is entirely voluntary

Well see, there you go.  I don't volunteer.  And nor, I suspect, will most of the productive people who actually have jobs, are proud of what they've earned and achieved, and believe the current system adequately recompenses effort, diligence, mature postponement of instant-gratification, and other classically conservative ideals.

&gt; we should focus on addressing the inequality and injustice in the current system. Only when people are treated as equals can we expect them to act as equals.

Let me ask you this.  Let's say we start by treating everyone as equals: they all have the same rights, privileges, receive the same benefits, etc.  Now some of these individuals chose (decide) to misbehave.  They refuse to do their homework, or leave it until late at night after an evening of leisure and submit a poor result.  Others are surly and destructive during the day, ignoring their lessons in preference of short-term goals of amusement.

How would your system treat with such?  I freely admit that they will receive short shift under the current system, even less so under my private utopia.  The current result is: they won't get very good jobs.  They will end up poor and bitter.  They will have children whom they will abuse and rear in similarly destructive tendencies, with predictably lowered expectations.  Meanwhile, other students will receive a useful education, reap the expected benefits, and pass their ethos on to their own progeny.  A ""gap"" will emerge over generations, which idealists will term ""inequality and injustice"", directing the blame toward the system which allowed such conditions — such *choices* — to occur.

The Silurians ""counter attacking"" would have happened whether or not the crack existed, but The Doctor's involvement required a line of cause and effect that goes back to The Doctor helping Amy in The 11th Hour. This forces us to address the same issue that can be applied to all previous series and serials; does the universe course correct when causality should retconn a previous adventure, or does that adventure only occur to those who immediately experienced it? 

As an example, imagine if Amy and Rory DID in fact go and talk to their younger selves in 2020 at the location of the drill in Wales. Amy and Rory could bring up the crack in Amy's wall, Prisoner Zero, etc. and find that their younger selves there have no recollection of the crack but still SOME adventure that brought them together with The Doctor.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt;I don't assume that's the only motivation, but I do assume it covers 95% of use-cases. There are certainly people willing to work pro bono for nationalism, religion, or other beliefs

Well with conscription in wartime it affects a lot more than 5% of the population. And within a highly automated economy, all people would effectively be ""supported through other means"", but work to pay back that debt to society.

&gt;Sure, you can whip them until they pull a sled or load a trolley or whatever. But you can't, ever, force them to think.

Fundamentally there would be two types of remaining labour: menial labour which cannot be automated yet, and research, etc. which can inherently never be automated.

In the case of the former legislating that people have to work for society for some time could resolve it (and it'd be a better situation for many who face overwork and unemployment now), in the case of the latter you are right that you cannot force people to invent, etc. - but people working in these areas would likely do so out of competition and recognition anyway. Already this is largely the case, as institutions not individual researchers make the profit from patents, etc.

But there are many proposed solutions to this problem of incentive. _The Ragged Trousered Philanthropists_ would retain the wage system for example, while _Looking Backward_ would abolish it in favour of an equal supply of credit to be spent differently. While I'm not certain what is the best solution, I am certain that any change will be better than the current system, for the incentive the current system produces is often unfair (forcing some to work whilst others live in riches off of property and hereditary wealth), and is only an incentive to increase profits whatever the social or environmental consequences. I mean, if necessary, we can step back all the way to just collectivising the means of production and still retain the wage system, providing people with the bare necessities for life and nothing more from the government, then they would still be compelled to work to improve their material goods but we would not have this class of people that live without work just from the fact they have monopolised the Earth's land and resources. 

By collectivising the means of production we can solve a huge number of problems - from the environmental damage caused by the shortsightedness of the market system and the Tragedy Of The Commons with communal resources, to the failure to invest in important research like Nuclear Fusion that is not profitable in the short-term, to ending the problems of unemployment, poverty and recessions.

I can see no problem with the basic idea of using communal resources for the benefit of all, and employing science and technology to relieve the work burden on all, the other matters are details of implementation.

&gt;How will you resolve that?

Again, there are many solutions. Some would recommend focussing on educating the parents and creating good communities for the children through investment in education and community services, but is difficult to solve cultural problems.

Others would recommend the abolition of the traditional family unit, so that all people are treated as individuals from birth. But of course this is quite heavy handed and would likely be met with resistance.

There are many proposed solutions, and it's hard to say which would work. But within the current system they are effectively written off from the start and that's not really fair, we should at least provide free adult education so that people can be educated when they are truly mature individuals and not so dependent on their family and environment.

But I don't think the problem is so great as to undermine the approach, that would be like saying the entire welfare system and NHS will never work because of the behaviour of some pikeys. Sure, they cause problems, but it works for the majority of people and solving the other problems are separate issues.

Slight aside and clarification if anyone is annoyed/concerned by my description of those who support Baroness Warsi. 
""Islamophobia-is-real-word"" - I couldn't think of a better term for the people who are saying that hatred of Muslims is rife in the UK. Nothing against them but I was simply searching for a descriptive term. While I am not saying they are wrong, I do however disagree with the use of that word. I for one do not like Islam, but have no problem with general Muslims. I view Catholics and Catholicism is in the same way. Here endeth the arse covering.

I can only say that the meeting did happen – it happened, I might add, in the hotel where Andrew Gilligan had his meetings with the unfortunate David Kelly! Afterwards, as is my custom, I made a record of the meeting in my diary.

&gt;XYZ – All else will be done by engineering circumstances in which radical action will seem to have been forced on an unwilling Conservative Government. For example, the European issue will be settled by a strategy that beings with all the Majorite “heart of Europe” rhetoric. Our Government will make solidly Europhile noises, and will give way on matters that cause outrage within the wider Movement. However, we will then engineer a crisis in Brussels, where we are bullied into accepting what we say is unacceptable. The crisis will proceed to the point where we announce we have no choice but to call a referendum on continued membership. And there will be unacceptable demands from Brussels – that is how these things work. We can portray ourselves as forced by circumstances into actions that we find unwelcome but also unavoidable.

Yes, and people don't like it.  That's why it's been outlawed in both England and America.  We kind of like this whole ""freedom"" thing.  Of course, conscription's still the norm in Russia and China, coincidentally two of the nations which have experimented with similarly planned societies to yours.

Regardless of whether you think Britain should move in that direction (clearly you do), do you really think the majority of other Britons share this view?  Is this simply a hypothetical exercise, or a proposal for an actual political platform?  Or do the choice and risk inherent in a democratic referendum not hold much appeal for you?  Your deliberate invocation of terms like ""conscription"" and ""compelled to work"" imply that you're not terribly concerned with the opinions or preferences of those you hope to enlighten.

&gt; institutions not individual researchers make the profit from patents

I know lots of patent holders (and a patent attorney), and can say (1) the engineers who propose and complete a useful patent get nice bonuses, raises, promotions, and job security (or resume boost if security's not their thing), and (2) their ESOP / pension company shares rise at the same time as everyone else's (noting that each and every ""institution"" ends up being owned by, ultimately, individuals).

&gt; people working in these areas would likely do so out of competition and recognition anyway

You seem to be leveraging the incentivizing motivation of pride and envy in this context, without allowing how it would simultaneously undermine those same individuals' appetite for the communal sharing of wealth, discoveries, prestige etc.  If people are encouraged by the hot drive of competition and rivalry, they are likely to adopt the same ""us versus them"" tribal mentality which underlies the cultural, racial, theological, and simple national balkanization defining every boundary on the geopolitical map.

&gt; **While I'm not certain what is the best solution, I am certain that *any* change will be better** than the current system, **for** the incentive **the current system** produces **is *often* unfair**

That's a keeper, and I'm going to leave it untouched because anything I might add could only spoil it.

&gt; I can see no problem with the basic idea of using communal resources for the benefit of all

Here's the problem I see: my mind (and my life and my time on this earth) is not a ""communal resource"".  It's *mine*.  Being as that it is mine, and that only I am authorized to dispense of its fruits, therefore only I can choose with whom I wish to lease its talents, or at what rate or measure I will accept in return.

&gt; the other matters are details of implementation

No, there are still some very fundamental philosophical, economic, political, and theological hurdles — policy, not procedure — which require rigorous debate and discussion with that full ""community"" you so blithely bandy about.  ""I can see no problem with..."" is not *quite* the threshold of proof and demonstration we need to meet in order to turn global economics on its head.

&gt; but it is difficult to solve cultural problems.

See, I knew we could agree on something :-)

Regrettably, you've been doing all the heavy lifting — it's much more difficult to create, define, and solve an entire new universe, while detractors have only to throw pebbles and defend the status quo.

&gt;Regardless of whether you think Britain should move in that direction (clearly you do), do you really think the majority of other Britons share this view?

I'm not sure, I mean with the fundamental point of abolishing the unfair monopolisation of the Earth's resources and using automation for the benefit of all, I am sure many would agree. Of course, things get a little more complicated in the details. I don't think we could realistically achieve it soon, because the barriers to democracy are so great and peoples' convictions set firm, but as our technology improves the situation will only grow more absurd when less labour is required and the inequality reaches greater heights. That's assuming that we don't just fail to invest in sufficient energy research, or blindly pollute our environment before we reach such a time.

But fundamentally I believe in democracy, and indeed that is one of the problems of the current system, that the inequality in wealth means that it is far easier for the views of the wealthy elite to be published over others, and the same holds for campaign funding, etc. too - as we see with the effective bribery in lobbying.

&gt;I know lots of patent holders (and a patent attorney)...

Hmm, this is less of the case in research where the results aren't really patentable (like astrophysics for example). And you could argue that the main competition is for recognition, which would continue, rather than material gain alone.

You also have to keep in mind the downsides that the patent system entails - where we leave people to die of treatable diseases because we must charge high amounts for the drugs just to repay the research, rather than having the research funded by society and the cost of the drugs be their actual production cost. This also extends to the knowledge economy with all the problems of piracy and the need to charge for access to scientific journals, textbooks, etc. - such artificial scarcity should not be necessary.

&gt;If people are encouraged by the hot drive of competition and rivalry

Competition need not be harmful at all. It can be friendly in pursuing different approaches, I mean, a good example of this is the Free Software community with different Window Managers competing, etc. where they share good ideas rather than patenting them to prevent the progress of others.

&gt;Being as that it is mine, and that only I am authorized to dispense of its fruits, therefore only I can choose with whom I wish to lease its talents, or at what rate or measure I will accept in return.

And that is fine. But what choice do most people have? Do I have the choice over how I use my time when I am forced to stack shelves at ASDA to cover costs in the summer, do those in sweatshops and other needless tasks have any choice in the matter?

All I propose is that _all_ people are given equal choice in what work they pursue, so that all may pursue the work most fitted to their abilities, to the greatest benefit of themselves and society. The current waste of life in menial labour and unemployment is a direct affront to this.

But you make another point that you should be able to choose what you accept in return. Again, the majority are denied this choice now as the choice is the lowest wages the workforce will bear or unemployment, but ignoring that for now, the larger problem is the belief in complete self-sufficiency. However, in any civilised society this is not the case, we are all the recipients of inherited knowledge and technology which eases our lives, and we all depend on the work of others and those who have preceded us.

&gt;No, there are still some very fundamental philosophical, economic, political, and theological hurdles — policy, not procedure — which require rigorous debate and discussion with that full ""community"" you so blithely bandy about. 

Well I agree, I mean, I don't think I am some perfect Supreme Leader :P All decisions must be made democratically and willingly. Things won't change overnight, but the greater concern is that we move in the right direction at all, towards a society where automation is universally beneficial and no-one can live solely of off birthright and resources robbed from others.

It isn't fair because the children are not independent individuals at that age. It is bizarre that for all the social welfare we have achieved, we have never realised the absurdity in providing the only opportunity for free education at a time when we are so reliant upon our environment and parenting. 

You consider that such a society would use social engineering, as though our current society does not. But all the time through advertisements, the mass media and our culture, our behaviour and ethics are influenced and shaped. Basing the education around the mutual benefit of society rather than the individual profit of specific businesses, or the nationalist defence of private property, does not make it any more sinister.

I can see no greater freedom than the freedom from menial labour and the effective servitude created by the inequality in wealth. The system would provide greater freedom to individuals than is provided to the majority now, I mean, as Upton Sinclair wrote in _The Jungle_:

&gt; ""And yet there were things even worse. You would begin talking to some poor devil who had worked in one shop for the last thirty years, and had never been able to save a penny; who left home every morning at six o'clock, to go and tend a machine, and come back at night too tired to take his clothes off; who had never had a week's vacation in his life, had never traveled, never had an adventure, never learned anything, never hoped anything—and when you started to tell him about Socialism he would sniff and say, ""I'm not interested in that—I'm an individualist!"" And then he would go on to tell you that Socialism was ""paternalism,"" and that if it ever had its way the world would stop progressing. It was enough to make a mule laugh, to hear arguments like that; and yet it was no laughing matter, as you found out—for how many millions of such poor deluded wretches there were, whose lives had been so stunted by capitalism that they no longer knew what freedom was!

On the one hand it could be another check against a government becoming too powerful and passing laws that criminalise people for relatively harmless minor offences or for activities that oppose them.  

On the other hand, I instinctively feel that the likes of Brady and Huntley etc. should probably be deprived of the right to take part in the democratic process as well as deprived of their liberty.

Then there's the consideration that prisoners could well be much more motivated to vote, what with not much else to do on polling day, and so be disproportionately represented and more likely to form potentially influential voting blocks.

But then this very involvement in the democratic process and a sense of having some influence could be a way of creating feelings of being more involved with society and a sense of responsibility, and so add another rare element of rehabilitation to custodial sentences.

Tricky. I dunno.

true,Black_Apalachi,lfc87,null,"&gt; I am proud to be able to pull on my Liverpool jersey and will never go to another club in England. I would never go to Manchester United or Everton, for example. It's about a form of respect for the club.  
  
I know I'm in a minority but that sounds a little extreme to me and I'm not sure whether I even believe him. I would expect that of Gerrard and Carragher; they're proper home-grown players in every meaning of the word.  
  
However, foreign players come and go all the time and I'm hardly surprised when they make somewhat controversial moves for the sake of their careers. The way I see it is this: if I was a footballer, my dream would obviously be to play for Liverpool. But if I somehow ended up at some other massive club, like Barcelona for example, I wouldn't feel any personal passion or extreme loyalty for the club. It would just be my job until the next big opportunity came along. I'd never be able to leave Liverpool though.  
  
Daniel Agger is a Dane playing at a foreign club in what is arguably the biggest league in the world. Why the fuck *wouldn't* he go to United or Chelsea if the chance presented itself? Even Michael Owen; sure he emerged from within the club and he is relatively local, but he's still not Scouse so it's no big surprise that he went off to United. He was my hero as a kid anyway so I can't stay mad at him. :P Besides, he was fucked (in terms of fitness) long before he left us -- we definitely had the best of him, and then some.

Some players are mercenaries like Torres, but then you have others who totally respect the history and loyalties of the club.  Agger appears to fall in to the latter group.  But again, it's hard to know for sure because Torres seemed to be like this, too.

Agger is good enough that other clubs, like City, will always be interested.  So we'll see what happens.  Hopefully he scores a few for us this year like he did for country yesterday.",0,1297393386,null,0,false,0,c1gbmyq,t3_fj42o,t1_c1gbmyq,t1_c1gbhxu,1426909250,6,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,6

I live on a private road, so the local association signed a contract for the clampers to operate on the street, namely to target people parking there and walking into the local high street. I have a parking spot 150 yards from the front door behind the house.

On one occasion I brought my wife and new born baby back home from the hospital and parked out the front of my own home as the misus was still in pain from having a c-section so she could not walk far. I also had a new born baby in a car seat in the other hand screaming out for her worn out mom. Add to that we were all quite stressed and tired from not sleeping.

Whilst getting my exhausted wife down to bed and putting baby down in the car seat the clampers jumped right on to the opportunity and set about my vehicle. I came out called them as they were driving off and explained the situation. They replied with 'you need to appeal mate, hands are tied' so I paid them the 130 pound fine reluctantly and went back to wife and baby.

Long story short I sent an appeal showing copies of the hospital discharge license showing the wifes operation and her leaving hospital 10 minutes before the clamp, house deeds to show I own the property and a full letter explaining what happened. They rejected my claim. 

After this I never did get my money back. But I got in the local paper and managed to get them kicked out of a local business that they operated at.

I was also in the process of trying to convince the local association to turf them out to, but as the law is being changed they are already in the process of doing this.

Unlike the new testament, the Koran is reputedly the word of God straight from an angel, heard by Muhammed. I don't think it leaves much room for interpretation. If you believe Muhammed spoke to God, you believe these words to be divine.

The science of sharia (fiqh) are dictated by the specialists on the law, the ""faqih"". Four schools remain today and are shared among the orthodox Muslim (sunni) population. They developed a doctrine of the infallibility of the consensus (ijma); and by A.D 900, Islamic law became fixed. There is an authority to follow the consensus.

That said, I completely understand your point. Many mosques might do things differently, some Muslims may not want sharia law but muslims submit to God; their God.

That's their choice and I'm not forced to do it. So I don't.

That's not abuse - that's something people are volunteering for and agreeing to the terms, again, by their choice. No-one is being forced to. 

&gt; My point of view is that if you do not have anything to hide, you are not affraid of such document and the 'database'. That is, unless you are a criminal.

That's a very uneducated view. Read some history. There are many many reasons to hide things from the government and authority. To paraphrase someone famous, give me 6 lines written by the hand of an honest man and I will find something to hang him. Many things are not illegal but will still cause a stigma in your society. Many things that are not presented in the right context can destroy your life. Accusations with no foundation can ruin your career.

Nobody, I hope, is even trying to imply that protests against rising tuition fees and broken political promises are on the same level of import as a struggle for basic democratic rights, but that does not negate them as issues worthy of debate and protest. There will, after all, always be somebody in a worse situation than you. I'm sure there are many countries around the world in far worse positions than Egypt, but I'm not wont to dismiss Egyptian concerns on the basis that North Koreans may have it worse.

In other words, one cannot (or certainly should not) dismiss one group's right to protest by arguing that what they are protesting against isn't important to you. You may find tuition fees a laughable issue, but the right to protest and be heard is not contingent upon wider acceptance of your view. That's why I don't have a problem with comparing Cameron's views on protest between the two countries - because it doesn't matter what he thinks of the issue at hand, it only matters that people have a right to be heard.

People's priorities are different, really their entire world-view is quite different.  You could impose Sweden's political system on Liberia but Liberia won't suddenly become Sweden.

You should be treated if you are an alchoholic, or if you need medical attention because you got drunk.  Hopefully you learn your lesson.  But you should be penalised  if you take advantage of the system and you are a regular visitor.  

If you drink and you are violent, or you drive and you are drunk, then that is not just anti social, it is a criminal.  If that is the case, then you really should not be drinking.

so, what exactly has or hasn't happened in the doctor who universe, now that the series is over? Are all bets off, as far as doctor who 'history' as we know it?
""more like all bets that we feel like ignoring are off. The increasing problem in doctor who is that the people in the show live on a completely different planet from us. They're like 'look, more aliens, planets in the sky, ho hum!'
but history has wibbled. Without being too explicit about it, we can have characters suprised at the existence of aliens again. If we feel like it. But let's be honest - it's only us fans who give a toss about all this. So don't expect any 'history has wibbled' scenes.

So the Dalek invasion happened before Amy was a time traveler, so she doesn't remember once they've been wiped from existence. Easy enough. Then she travels to WWII and sees some Daleks, which she doesn't remember because they've been wiped from existence. Only they're existing, because even though they were wiped in 102 AD, it hasn't happened yet. Then the Doctor hurls himself into the crack so everything the crack ate could be restored in people's memories (Rory, the Pond parents, all other planets,) and people STILL don't remember the Daleks.

'means-tested' in U.K. higher education seems to mean ""if you're poor, you get a shit-ton of benefits, if you're rich, you can afford it anyway, but if you're middle class, GTFO"". How is that fair? Middle class parents shouldn't have to get a second mortgage just to send their kids to university.

But this is getting off-topic. Ultimately Clegg isn't talking about maintenance grants, he's talking about tuition grants.

Now, I'm the first to admit that a lot of that is about racism, social/economic exclusion, but a lot of it is also about the top-down policy of multiculturalism.

However, I certainly agree with you on the schools, and I'm also very chary of the idea of cultural ""universals"" for what it's worth - Whilst I'm certainly not a moral relativist, I tend to subscribe to several of the arguments against multiculturalism from the left.  e.g.

On the one hand we had some really good stuff (consider the acceptance of homosexuality today versus 1997 for example) but on the other we had stupid things like the Equality Act making it illegal for comedians to tell jokes.

As such, the definition of racism was twisted from what had previously considered to be active acts against people on the grounds of race, to things that could offend someone (but may well not). Following on from this, governments in areas such as Bradford and Oldham (as well as elsewhere, and I'm not restricting this to any particular race of people) stopped trying to assimilate immigrants and their descendents which in turn promoted ghettoisation and produced the opposite outputs to what the policy originally intended.

We should accept that people are different, but if they want to come here then as welcome as they are to come, they must integrate with the rest of us.

I found the New Labour government to be disturbingly authoritarian, and it's spending increases were equivilant to bribing the populace with money borrowed from their future children. So, if nothing else I am glad they're gone. 

Because of the financial mess that left us in, the post-Brown government, whichever political party it was made up of, had some difficult choices to make. As borrowing had now become more difficult - it has to increase taxes and decrease spending, and attempt to keep the borrowing under control. This was never going to be popular. 

The questions then become - where do we cut spending, and who do we levy the new taxes on? You obviously do not like the new governments answer to these questions, and would perhaps have expected higher corporation tax, taxing whoever you consider to be rich, and budget freezes across the board. IMO this would not have worked. 

So, in summary, I don't like the spending cuts, or the tax increases, but I don't see the point in whining about them, as the fiscal policies of the last few governments have put us where we are and now we have to deal with it.

As far as I can see we have a government that's already dishonest and deliberately disingenuous, is populated by rich white folks with little to no experience of anything outside Whitehall and which doesn't have any ideas beyond spending less money.

I voted Lib Dem in the hope of having, you know, an economist in charge of the economy, rather than a professional Whitehall mandarin who grew up in a castle.  Evidence-based judgement on policy rather than lobby based.  Maybe even frank communication with the country rather than Rupert Fscking-Murdoch and Andy Coulson.

Cuts are necessary - it's not the cuts that make me most angry.

I also wonder where the moral authority to rule comes from.  Cameron and the Tories didn't win a majority of the vote, weren't open about what they were asking people to vote for and had the majority of the press spouting their side.

Where the coalition are weak is in social initiatives, which is not surprising given the players involved. However, it's important to look at social initiatives that work, and not just throw money at places like DfID to fund India's growth for example.

I think if Labour were in power they'd try to spend their way out, and it wouldn't go down well at all. The tories are taking the harder option of cuts.

If Labour did invest, the Conservatives would call it wasteful spending, and vice versa if you switch the parties round. Both of the major parties have vested interests in blaming the other to keep them out of power for generations in order to maximise the time they have to achieve their goals. 

Anyway, I endorse the concept of a coalition government. I would not mind this one so much but I've yet seen the coalition promote something that isn't 'removing this' or 'cutting this'.

All government policy is based on theories of what will happen if we do X in response to Y. There are absolutely no givens, and no simple answers, as you seem to believe.  

&gt; And it is a fact that a very large amount of people will be made unemployed by the cuts - the exact figure varies depending on which source you use.

Some will. Almost all of whom were on some form of government pay. They'll be unemployed for a time, but when they *do* eventually find employment again, it will be in the private sector, and therefore not at the cost of the taxpayer. 

&gt; If they don't have money to buy goods and services, then how will the vendors of these goods and services grow, hire more people and benefit the economy

You are presupposing that unemployment is a permanent state of affairs. It isn't. The cost to the state is reduced, as they are no longer employed by the state, and for many time spend on the dole will be minimal. When they are re-employed in the private sector they put money *back* into the economy, instead of taking it out indirectly by being employed by the state. 

&gt; The huge growth in unemployment is not going to be offset by the cut in corportation tax

Firstly, it's debatable as toe whether it will be ""huge"". Secondly, unemployment is temporary. And thirdly, the whole point of the cut in corporation tax is to attract companies here, thus employing them. If you want a real world example: look at the growth of Hong Kong.

Telling someone that they only believe in 'simple answers' is petty and not likely to win that person over to your point of view. As I stated in my original comment, I'm not an economist. My answers may seem 'simple' as compared to, say, someone who's studied an economics degree, or someone who works for the treasury, but this doesn't make my viewpoint any less valid.

You seem to think that unemployment is a short stop-gap between jobs. This is not the case for everyone, and certainly not the case in the current climate. The simple fact is there are more working-age people in this country than there are jobs, and new jobs are not being created at a rate that can sustain them. What about the people from the public sector who have been highly trained in a specific thing, like a police officer. If you've been a police officer for 10 years then you're going to find it hard to get a bog standard office job because your skill set won't match up. 

Your whole argument seems to boil down to public sector = bad, private sector = good. Neither sector is perfect. To say that the private sector can absorb public sector job losses in  short space of time is not realistic, as the private sector is not growing quickly enough. The people from the public sector are probably going to end up unemployed for at least several months, during which time they will face hardship which this government doesn't seem to feel is worth caring about.

------


This is the shortlist of my favourite BBC Radio 4 shows that are available as podcasts (grabbed from an earlier longer list I made in a comment on the subject of podcasts). In no particular order:

* 
**In Our Time** - In-depth discussion of a different topic each week (from Arts, Science, History, Philosophy) with 3 expert academics in the subject and the cantankerous Melvyn Bragg bullying them to talk sense.


* 
**The Infinite Monkey Cage** - Witty science and comedy chat with Prof Brian Cox, Robin Ince and guests and audience.


* 
**Friday Night Comedy** - Weekly topical comedy from the BBC. Alternates between the brilliant News Quiz (panel comedy news game) and the not quite so funny Now Show (sketch show based on the week's news).

* 
**Material World** - Latest developments in science with the astoundingly enthusiastic Quentin Cooper interviewing the actual scientists and other people involved.

* 
**Great Lives** - Biography series: A celebrity chooses someone who's no longer with us as their great life, and discusses why with an expert on the person they've chosen and host Matthew Parris. Often fascinating alternate views even of people you thought you knew all about.

* 
**The Front Row Podcast** - Latest in the world of movies, plays, books, and culture with intelligent interviews with the directors, stars and authors by the incisive Mark Lawson, who caused Russell Crowe to storm out in anger last year.

Also, **Radio 4 Choice**, which is Radio 4's own pick of their best documentary from that week; i.e. they produce a lot of one-off shows outside of the regular series shows. These one-offs are in many ways the best thing about Radio 4, but are harder to list and access, since there are so many of them and they aren't comprehensively archived.

River Song used the written form ""ΘΣ"" on a message to the eleventh Doctor on Planet One, though the Doctor specifically called these and other apparently Greek numbers on the cliff face ""co-ordinates"". (DW: The Pandorica Opens)

Woah! What? Firstly, I never told you any such thing, and I was not intensionally insulting you. Please don't be so sensitive. 

Your arguments *were* simplistic. If you read back over what you said it boils down to: ""Lets keep loads of people in public sector jobs to 'stimulate' the economy and keep people in work"". 

This *is* is a simplistic argument, from my perspective at least. I have heard it so many times from so many people, and yet, it always falls apart under analysis. Public sector jobs are always ultimately funded by taxes or borrowing. Taxes come from Private sector jobs, and borrowed funds have to repayed at interest. Ergo, if you *create* public sector jobs you are creating an increased tax and/or borrowing burden. Borrowing is now much more expensive thanks to the financial crisis, and the increase in taxes will be going toward paying off the decifit, not hiring more public sector workers. So... what you are suggesting will actually put the country into a worse financial position, because we'd either have to hike taxes up even higher, or we'd have to pay off less of the deficit, ultimately costing us more money in the long run.

true,back-in-black,english,England,"&gt; Firstly, lets stop with the personal attacks please. Telling someone that they only believe in 'simple answers' is petty and not likely to win that person over to your point of view. 

I have not made any personal attacks on you. From what I can see you argument is a fairly simplistic one, and I'm just calling a spade a spade. If you calm down and think about it for a bit, you'll realise that just because I am attacking your argument, this does not mean I am attacking you as a person. Do you see the difference?

&gt; As I stated in my original comment, I'm not an economist. My answers may seem 'simple' as compared to, say, someone who's studied an economics degree, or someone who works for the treasury, but this doesn't make my viewpoint any less valid.

Oh, dear. I hope you don't really think this, and it was just written in the heat of the moment. 

My opinion on neurosurgury is *not* as valid as someone who is actually a neurosurgeon. The opinion of a Creationist on climate change is not as valid as the opinion of a geologist or climatologist. 

There is a difference between allowing people to say whatever they want on whatever subject they want (freedom of speech), and taking what they say seriously based on what they actually know.

&gt; Your whole argument seems to boil down to public sector = bad, private sector = good

Not really. It boils down to the fact that public sector = funded by taxpayer, and private sector = funded by individuals and businesses. 

&gt; Neither sector is perfect.

It's not about whether one sector is better than the other, its about how employees in each sector get payed, and how their work is funded. 

&gt; To say that the private sector can absorb public sector job losses in short space of time is not realistic, as the private sector is not growing quickly enough.

Well, there are enough variables in here for a lengthy debate in itself. Lets just say - ""we'll see"".

I actually think your core argument of  public sector = bad, private sector = good is 'simple', but I didn't say that to you, because saying that to you doesn't constitute a proper argument in a debate. By your reasoning, only trained economists should be allowed to talk about the economy. What's the point of letting people vote then? Pick any random person from random UK town and I can bet they won't pull a huge wad of spreadsheets about government spending out of their pocket when asked about the defecit.

Probably, but there isn't any real benefit over the trail version.  What the license pays for is access to their stats database.  That's what makes it so much better than MStrat or MSMFWB - you've got immediate access to all the plays of other Morners in real time[*].  

When Puskin pulled his legendary switchback in last year's Euro cup the routes were available to play within minutes.  And not just the basic point-to-point, but full bifurcation analysis (the pro version goes 11 levels deep and covers *all* contact points... I think the basic version only goes 7 deep and covers connecting points, but unless you're playing professionally, that's all you're ever going to need... and if you are a pro, well then you're not going to worry about paying £200).

I'm inclined to agree.  Any assistance during a competition, electronic or otherwise,  would of course be a complete no-no.  But these days you need to be tracking at least 2, maybe 3 years of play data if you want to keep your game up to date and that's just not possible without decent archive/analysis software.  It's a bit of a shame that the true amateur has been squeezed out of tournament play, but if you want to keep up with the youngsters then you really have to make the digital switch.

The coalition is having to make the necessary decisions to cut the deficit and eventually get the country in a position to be able to pay down the debt.

Sure, some of the decisions have and are being a little short sighted (higher education cuts for example), but I fail to see why anyone can disagree that cuts are necessary.

Furthermore, Mubarak clung onto power with rigged elections. This is not true in the UK - indeed, it seems to be Labour who has the advantage (though probably not due to electoral fraud). 

The coalition is as legit as any other government, given that we don't elect the government, we elect an MP. It is then up to those MPs to figure out who is going to run the country if it is not already clear.

We have a large defecit; i.e. we are spending much more than we are borrowing. However, our overall level of debt is not necessarily critical (and is largely due to the global recession). If the economy were to pick up, the defecit would shrink naturally. Certainly the best long term method to reduce the defecit is to improve the economy. Which is why everyone is kicking up a fuss about the Conservative economic policy. Cutting isn't enough. They need to get the economy moving.

Not entirely related, but worth bearing in mind I think...

- Cutting is in itself useful. If you never cut, then you never improve efficiency. Going through cycles of spending and cutting is how change happens. It's not un-natural.
- The risk of what will happen if we don't cut is pretty well balanced by the worry about what will happen if we cut too fast. Both routes carry the potential for disaster and no economist can say for sure which is the best course of action.
- My personal opinion... I don't have such a problem with cuts. What gets me is what's happening with the NHS. If they were just cutting it a bit, that would be okay. We could put the funding back in when times were better. But they are destroying it. We won't be able to put the funds back in because it won't be there anymore.

No need. She has been voluntarily struck off. Anywhere else she went they would ask for her past record...

&gt; But either way, you have to admit that failing to spot that a child had a broken back is a fairly serious mistake to make.

It may be serious but it's not necessarily negligent.

As a layman, assuming you were able to examine the child, what symptoms would you expect to see to indicate a broken back?

&gt; Anyway, I wasn't really trying to make a point, just an observation. I make mistakes all the time so I'm not going to start throwing stones at others. But when I make a world class mistake some software crashes, or maybe a web site goes down for a bit. I don't envy doctors one bit.

Thank you for saying that. Unfortunately most non-doctors, whilst excusing their own mistakes and putting it down to normal human error, expect perfection from the medical profession, and are all to ready to rip doctors to shreds at the slightest indication of fallibility.

No. It is not known whether she was negligent or not, largely on account of the fact that there has not been a full GMC hearing.

&gt; Negligence occurs everyday and it's a little unlucky for such a tragic thing to happen due to her mistake, despite it being a big mistake.

It is also debatable whether she did actually make a *mistake*: medicine and the practise of medicine is not perfect and precise as most lay people expect and demand. The question is whether she did what was reasonable under the circumstances.

&gt; People should be punished based on exactly what they missed and the circumstances surrounding it rather than the tragic outcome.

People should be punished if and only if what they did was *malicious*. Doctors should only be struck off the medical register if what they did (which must be proved) was either malicious or the result of incompetence.

I partly agree with your assertion which, if I may paraphrase, amounts to 'punish the act not the outcome'. However, I would assert that we should assess *actions* when deciding competence, and *intent* when deciding punishment.

&gt; In fact, this isn't actually supposed to be a punishment (that's where the legal system comes in) but to assess whether she is fit to practice in future 

Indeed. However, it amounts to a punishment when you're on the receiving end, especially given how slowly the wheels turn.

&gt; and to be honest, I doubt she will make the same mistake again. She is after-all a consultant who has been working for ages and I don't remember any other mistakes like this being reported.

Given how she has suffered since, and her consequent mental state, it is very unlikely that she will practise again.

true,GuyOnTheInterweb,uk,Stockport,"Imagine you earn £1,756 net per month. You pay your utility bills, food, Sky+ and perhaps the odd holiday, on average £2,230/month. Now this means the difference of £474 will have to go on your credit card. You've got a great 4.4% deal with the bank, so you only need to pay £141/month in interest on your credit card. 

You've managed to get away with this for years, but the bank has started to worry as you've now got a credit card balance of £38,461, but you've not made any repayments since the 90s. Your arguments that your additional spending on a bigger van might give you a stronger income in the future is no longer convincing the bank. 

The bank warns you that unless you start making repayments, they will increase the interest rate to a regular credit card rate. For example, a rate of 5,7% (which you've heard your neighbour just got on his card) means interest payments of £182/month at your current balance.

Now, the coalition argument is that it's better to try to start saving money now to reduce the £474 overspending (perhaps drop holidays and luxuries, sell the motorcycle).

The alternative of simply not dealing with the issue for another few years, means you would then be overspending £600/month - you would have to do more drastic cuts, move to a different neighbourhood and get rid of your car, but that could mean you would have to change to a lower-paid job, and you would go in negative again, having to save even more money..

The small state approach that the current coalition government is heading towards comes from a time when the concept of 'international' big businesses was exceptionally limited. The state in some countries expanded in order to deal with the developing businesses as it was proven, shock horror, that big business is not always interested in helping the locality they are based in. Thus legislation and intervention came about.

To try strip away all the protective legislation to encourage businesses and effectively neuter the states power to be involved would empower corporations to take the piss. They would be in a strong position to manipulate municipal government and our liberal ideals run the risk of meaning nothing.

In the context of what you've said; because the banks are international, we can't do a damn thing locally but they can do a lot more harm to us if we so much as tried. In this even the governments hands are tied, which is why ties to the EU are, in my opinion, important in order to regulate larger corporations as just one goal of economic policy.",0,1297642139,null,0,false,0,c1go5p9,t3_fkin4,t1_c1go5p9,t1_c1go350,1426915287,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

Working for a time in the city, I didn't quite see that, but I did watch a couple of traders light their cigars with a fifty. I'm disappointed I didn't see the fart lighting now though :(

I see your point about the deficit, but over the last few years I came to the conclusion the financial system as a whole is the problem, because it is based on an insane principle of keeping the great unwashed stupid through lies and misinformed education.
