Your point is perfectly valid though, and quite interesting to investigate. I'm a Christian myself, but I like to find out about other beliefs or worldviews and their origins.

Islam, for one, is a faith that varies wildly depending on where the muslim you are speaking to is from.

Those in Indonesia or the Philippines are often prone to mix Islam with Animism, those in African countries sometimes mix Islam with ancestor-worship.

As for long term progression of artists, that is going to become a problem. Why spend a lifetime putting your soul into something when your accountant mate earns way more than you and still downloads illegally? 

So I'm probally part of the problem myself, but I didn't start this fight, the music industry did back in the 90's, and now there are a whole generation of people who like me went from penniless teenagers to gainfully employed without ever having to buy our media content and who don't see why they should start now, especially in these austere times.

New Adventures - Timewyrm: Exodus, Timewyrm: Revelation, Cat's Cradle: Warhead (first part of the War Trilogy), Nightshade, Love And War, Lucifer Rising, White Darkness, Birthright, Iceberg, Blood Heat, The Left-Handed Hummingbird, Conundrum, No Future, Tragedy Day, Legacy, Theatre Of War, All-Consuming Fire, Blood Harvest, First Frontier, Warlock (War: 2), Set Piece, Sanctuary, Human Nature, Original Sin, Toy Soldiers, Head Games, Just War, Warchild (War: 3), SLEEPY, Death And Diplomacy, Happy Endings, Return Of The Living Dad, Damaged Goods (RTD's Novel), So Vile A Sin, Bad Therapy, Eternity Weeps, The Room With No Doors, Lungbarrow*

PDA's - The Hollow Men, Bullet Time, Relative Dementias, Heritage, The Algebra Of Ice

*Note that Lungbarrow requires a lot of background knowledge of the classic series and it's just plain hard to read the first 70 pages. But it was my first and favorite book.

I found it so interesting when I read recently about the protests about a tree that's meant to be thousands of years old, from Israel.

I think we've been talking at odds slightly: My comments are coming from England whereas you've got Scotland in mind mainly I think. Understandable.

&gt; Indoctrination

Ok you don't want to play with semantics, but I don't understand and would really like it explained how ""Not doing religion"" is the same as ""doing *a* religion"". Not having a position on religion and never mentioning or talking about it other than with regards to lessons like history or RE is simply not the same as having collective worship or being led in prayer in one particular religion.

A secular school doesn't teach ""We do not have a religion. You do not have a religion. There is no god here."": It doesn't say anything about religion. So please - how would a secular school indoctrinate?

&gt; This means having a variety of schools.

The problem is that many places, such as a country village, will provide education for a vast area. As such there can't be more than one or alternative options to the one being provided. My and many other's point is that this should not cater for the (very likely minority) religious parents. Children can be and most likely are taught about (what their parents want to be) their religion outside of school and at weekends, and so we're left with the question of why should all the other children have to be taught about that particular religion?

With regards to the taxpayer not funding a faith school - Although the wording and question was slightly off, I'll admit, my point was that in a situation like the one outlined above, a church could provide alternative schooling for the (very likely) minority group who want their children taught in a religious fashion.

As the BSA data tells us: ""No religion"" is apparently now the default with any and all religion being a minority to this position.

&gt;  I doubt they're really true in England or Wales either but I can't say for certain. 

Did you read the link? 

&gt; At present, [faith] schools can apply a religious test in appointing, paying and promoting all teachers.

Apologies, I mis-spoke before: *teachers* can't be sacked by faith schools for being gay, but homosexuals can be excluded/sacked in other specifically religious jobs. Religious groups lobbied for exemptions in the Equality Bill from a few years ago specifically so they cannot be prosecuted for objecting to employing someone who they deem unsuitable due to homosexuality etc. But it is the case that they could exclude from employing/sack someone for not being the correct faith.

It seems you went to quite a progressive school but the fact that this exemption from the law is still in place speaks volumes. Plus there are many faith schools that do force religion by degrees. My friend isn't daft - she was told these things at school and so were perhaps millions of other kids over the years. With regards to the creation story being allegorical, well it hasn't always been thought of that way and [there are people teaching children who still think it's true *exactly* how it's written along with other bits of the bible](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qjp4A6jBWzo&amp;feature=player_detailpage#t=359s). Perhaps that's an out-layer, but it's hardly the point. 

&gt; I can;t speak for all Catholics though and you ought not to either.

I tend to sew my comments with qualifiers, at least I hope I do and that it's clear. I have to say I'm surprised that you'd send your children to a Muslim school. Is ""some god"" better than ""no god""? Also can I ask on what particular subjects are you a secularist?

&gt;  I can say with confidence that Catholic schools don't push religion down the necks of non Catholic pupils

But you said this:

&gt; In term of Mass, on holidays of obligation (Ash Wednesday etc) and in primary school we went on the third friday of the month. We also got hymn practise once a week and did moring and afternoon prayers in primary school.

You attended just because because you were a Catholic, but what about all the other kids? I assume they had to attend too? Prayers in school *are* forcing children to perform acts specifically of a particular religion. Hearsay, but a friend of mine was told off for not bowing his head when it came to the prayers.

&gt; I don't know what has given some hardline atheists the idea that they all do, or even that most of them in the UK do.

OK, so what do you think is the reason that so many Churches/religious groups want to run schools (funded by the tax payer)? Remember how few people in the country (England) are CoE and also how many of the schools are run by the CoE.

&gt; Dawkins is really bad for this. The guy is the Ian Paisley of atheism, he's a professional bigot.

I think there is still a decent sized gap between City and anyone else, but no team is going to play perfectly every week. They played very bad against Chelsea and were pretty unlucky not to score a lot more against Arsenal.

* [FSF shows what is being proposed in comparison to the previous terraces](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm8eMyltBpM)

* 
The [Ellis Park Stadium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ellis_Park_Stadium_disaster) disaster on 11 April 2001 was a tragedy where 43 people died after being trampled at an all-seater stadium that was overrun with fans - crowding and poor policing.

These were a few things I looked up after looking at this article before posting. I will admit, I have little knowledge of Don Foster and whether or not he has some ulterior motive to the proposal, but I have been to many venues around the world with standing sections that were quite a bit of fun. I have not, however, had the opportunity to talk to anyone who was directly impacted by Hillsborough and am too young to have been there myself.

I have to say to anyone who may be/was offended, I am sorry. I was always under the impression, especially based on the sections of the Taylor report I read, that the survivors and their family's anger was due to the failed safety preparations and the cover up that followed - basically, that the injuries and deaths were caused by terrible police work in the buildup and aftermath of the crush, not because people were standing.  In fact, if I'm not mistaken, the Taylor report even stated that standing is not intrinsically unsafe, it was just about how standing was implemented at Hillsborough that caused the tragedy, but everyone switched to all-seater stadiums ""just in case"" rather than because of language in the report itself.

So again, sorry if you were offended. I should have looked up to see what the Hillsborough families think about this ([they have come out strongly against this](http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2011/mar/23/hillsborough-family-support-ground-standing-areas)) before getting excited about the possibilities.",0,1324330550,null,0,false,0,c39gndx,t3_nimqi,t1_c39gndx,t3_nimqi,1428046086,3,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,3

 If by 'national moral framework' you mean the law, then you have to take the rough with the smooth. By extension, it is surely the influence of Christianity that made homosexual intercourse illegal until 1961, abortion until 1967, prevented women from voting until 1928 and permitted capital punishment until 1969. Or were those particular laws (regarded in most civilized circles as bad things) *not* influenced by Christianity? I'm of course completely comfortable with admitting, for example, that William Wilberforce was very much motivated by his religious beliefs to campaign against slavery, and I'm glad that he did so. However when religion is so based upon the interpretation of dogma, especially when such texts mandate for example the stoning of 'men who lie with men' then its use as the basis for any sort of legal system is questionable at best.

If, alternatively, you mean 'national moral framework' as a collective term for the moral codes of multiple living individuals, you're making a very bold claim, and one that can't really be backed up by evidence, especially given that religious dogma is often so fundamentally opposed to what are nowadays considered immutable human rights by the majority of people. Personally I am more inclined to think that the moral codes of individuals are based upon their experiences, socialization on an interpersonal level and as media consumers, and capacity for empathy. Whilst there are still a minority of people in the UK to whom religion plays an important role in the lives of, religious morality is again very much open to interpretation.

As for history, I very much advocate that people do learn the background of society and how we came to where we are today, but I think it is important not to conflate what is generally considered a positive end result (the end of slavery, for instance) and the means by which it came about. An end to slavery would be equally good no matter whether it was brought about by campaigners motivated by religion or something else entirely.",0,1324340896,null,0,false,0,c39i7jw,t3_niguj,t1_c39i7jw,t1_c39ga8j,1428046819,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt;Do you read/listen to much of what he says or is that something you just know? What I'm asking is, can you point to a particular quote?

Yeah, I've read a quite a few of his articles and watched a few lectures. I don't have a particular quote, it's more a general impression of him. Maybe  Paisley was a bit harsh.  

Another significant difference I think is that everywhere in Scotland has a local Catholic and a local Non Denominational school.

&gt; With regards to the creation story being allegorical, well it hasn't always been thought of that way and there are people teaching children who still think it's true exactly how it's written along with other bits of the bible.

What the Fuck is this!?! Jesus Christ! That does not fly in Scottish Catholic Schools. Why don't they have to follow the national curriculum? Ok, I want to make clear that this not what I've been arguing in favor of. I'm not in favor of any and all religious education. It can be an element and a very helpful element but a science class with the 7 days story in it? That sloppy even as biblical scholarship.

Btw historically the old testament was viewed as allegorical or at least a form of literature. This is a noticeable cleavage between a protestant Knox/ Calvin biblically-centered faith and a Catholic interpretation/church centered faith. 

The school I went to had one noticeable religiously ideological bit of teaching outside of RE. In geography when we were doing the demographic transition model our teacher told us that birth control and contraception existed and could lower birth rates and that any further questions should be directed to the Religious Moral and Citizenship Education department.

&gt;I tend to sew my comments with qualifiers, at least I hope I do and that it's clear. I have to say I'm surprised that you'd send your children to a Muslim school. Is ""some god"" better than ""no god""? Also can I ask on what particular subjects are you a secularist?

Not sure what you mean by 'some god' here. i'm not in favour of learning any conception of god for its own sake. Just from what I know about Islam there is a great deal of overlap with Catholicism (emphasis on forgiveness, universal status of humanity as God children etc). Likewise I'd send my kid to a Buddhist school.

 few of my sisters went to an all girls catholic state school which had loads of Muslim students. My school had a few too. It's pretty common.

I'm a secularist in that I think that religion should be separate from politics and public affairs. i suppose I just see education as a part of the private sphere. It's about self development to me.  

&gt;You attended just because because you were a Catholic, but what about all the other kids? I assume they had to attend too? Prayers in school are forcing children to perform acts specifically of a particular religion. Hearsay, but a friend of mine was told off for not bowing his head when it came to the prayers.

Everyone had to sit through mass, but you didn't have to participate. Certainly not one was ever given into trouble for not taking communion, making the sign of peace, genuflecting, or bowing your head. Also school mass was always different to regular mass, more an assembly with the priest. You would only get into trouble for talking, it was basically the same etiquette as when the local MSP showed up.

Btw I'm watching the rest of In God's Name. I want to point out that I have more contempt for these guys than Dawkins. They really are not Christians in any reasonable sense, this is really letting the side down.

It's a criticism that can be levelled at the whole series, really. The social commentary in each episode has lacked any subtlety.

true,widgetas,null,null,"I should make it clear that the school shown in the documentary ""In god's name"" is the Carmel institute. It's not state funded and has its own curriculum. I included it as a demonstration of how certain parts of the OT are taught as truth: Make no mistake, there will be state funded faith schools that, even though they have the national curriculum, will teach certain 'biblical' things as fact and omit various aspects of science, for example.

Incidentally the Carmel Institute is very local to me, and a friend of mine was receiving driving lessons from Steven (guy with glasses in the documentary) until I found out who he was and showed her the documentary. That only occurred after he spent an hour telling her how his church could help her through her illness. True story.

Did you happen to see the Dawkins documentary from last year? [Faith School Menace](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzJv-5yWx2g). While you might not agree with what he says, or like him, it's really worth a watch. If you watch any of it, look at this section where Dawkins [asks a science teacher about her teaching of evolution from the national curriculum.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=pzJv-5yWx2g#t=1254s) Watch until ~24 mins and you'll no doubt cringe. If you don't watch I'll sum it up: Oddly enough, *all* the students at the Muslim school conclude that the Koran is correct and evolution is wrong.

Your surprise at children being taught various aspects of the bible... Without wishing to sound petulant: Where *have* you been!? As I say, you appear to have gone to a very progressive school. But I have to question your thoughts with regards to mass etc.:

&gt; Everyone had to sit through mass, but you didn't have to participate. 

Do you not see a problem with that? By being there, children are participating. They are being forced to listen 
to the songs, the prayers and the stories/sermons. Yes, they don't ""have"" to listen, but that's not the point. When people go to church at Christmas to sing carols and get a fuzzy feeling, do you think the church counts them as Christmas visitors or as Christians? Recently I was looking at attendance figures for the CoE. Something struck me as a possible discrepancy and so I looked it up. The CoE have had declining numbers for decades, well below 1million every Sunday, but they're switched to counting monthly now. But they do keep some weekly figures too. For some weird reason they like to detail how many children and young people attend. [Take a look at page 2 here](http://www.churchofengland.org/media/37495/2007provisionalattendance.pdf).

Children and young people (under 16) - Lowest/Highest weekly attendance. Notice that the numbers are *hugely* different. Four times as many young people in the highest attendance than in the lowest.

I think I know why: Church parade for Cubs, Scouts, Guides etc. I can think of no other explanation.

That underlines the point I was trying to make earlier: Churches and religious organisations generally don't care if people are taking part, they only care if they are there. The CoE is subtly skewing their figures by counting attendance for people who normally wouldn't go. My own mother made us go to church parade because it was ""part of being in the Scouts"". None of my family has ever had a religion - but my mother is a stickler for duty (needless to say I was bored off my arse for an hour a month, but that's another story).

But leaving that aside, there really is no difference between making someone attend a religious ceremony and making them take part - not when it comes to schools. The very fact that the children are forced to be there is problem enough. By the by, I think it was only in 2006 that parents got the legal option to remove their children from collective worship, and people over 16 were allowed to excuse themselves. However, when it comes to parents opting out they still face issues. [This is a good talk by Dr Antony Lempert on the subject of taking his daughter out of CW.](http://poddelusion.co.uk/blog/2011/09/21/secularism-2011-part-2/) (scroll down slightly to the 2nd podcast). Of course as CW is combined with assemblies this usually makes life even more difficult.

Further information on the problems parents have with faith schools, and the way in which they discriminate (which I think you might be skeptical about, and rightly so if you've only had positive experiences) [this research was released this month.](http://accordcoalition.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/Personal-testimonies-2011-FINAL1.pdf) It details problems that parents have had with such schools, their questionable admissions policies and their habits when it comes to some aspects of the curriculum. You might note the start of section 3 as it appears that Creation *was* taught as gospel (pun intended).

&gt; I'm a secularist in that I think that religion should be separate from politics and public affairs. i suppose I just see education as a part of the private sphere. It's about self development to me.

I find it very hard to understand how you would think it's fair that children from non-religious families should be subjected to a faith ethos in a school, even when it's highly likely that only a minority of children belong to families of that religion. Why is it not fairer, in your opinion, to teach without a particular (or any) faith in mind and leave the religious *instruction* (because that is what it is - it can be nothing else otherwise there is no argument for one particular church/religion keeping control of the school) for parents to teach at home or in their place of worship?

Last game we saw it took Hendo and Adam to fill the void left by Lucas, if we plug Gerrard back there he's apt to gravitate farther up the pitch, stranding Henderson, which we don't want. 
Honestly I would rather have Spearing back there. He'll work his tail off and be a little more of a defensive help for our back line.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt;I find it very hard to understand how you would think it's fair that children from non-religious families should be subjected to a faith ethos in a school, even when it's highly likely that only a minority of children belong to families of that religion.

I don't. I think its fair and desireable for parents to be able to chose the faith status of their school. Like I said in Scotland there is a local non deonominational and a local catholic school for everyone and if you don't like them there are placement requests. There are also Gaelic medium schools in the highlands and one in Glasgow. My point is you should be able to choose something other than secularism within the state school system.

Another difference we don't apply to schools really. There isn't the same application process as there is in England. Schools can't discriminate between pupils in anyway in terms of acceptance, other than if they are over subscribed they can stop taking placement requests from outside their catchment area (My schools catchment area covered 70,000 people). 

&gt;But leaving that aside, there really is no difference between making someone attend a religious ceremony and making them take part - not when it comes to schools.

I disagree. There is a difference to me - a 'take a horse to water' difference but an important one. That aside you can opt your kids out and if your over 16 you can excuse yourself. This guy seems to have had a bad experience but hey he speaks at a secular conferences and jokes about how you maybe cant have morals with religion, I'd take it with a bit of salt.

I think you should have a secular school for people to attend if they want. I am not in favor of a compulsory worship in every school. I think it's crazy that this doesn't seem to exist in England. 

I think the problems with the English education system maybe have more to do with the administration of education than the presence of religion. In Scotland the local council education dept appoints a head teacher and he/she runs the school and is accountable to the council. There is a PTA which is an advisory body but has no effective power. WTF is a board of governors and why does the church get a majority on it? Why do schools get to select their pupils? What elected body oversees these guys (I know there is for some reason like 5 layers of incomprhesable local government in England. We have unitary councils.) ?It seems like a total mess.

It seems like it's part of the larger story of England being the most incomprehensibly governed part of the UK.

Gotcha. However, this is unlikely to happen particularly in England. Many scattered small communities with only a few/one school(s) nearby. As such, as I said before, you're going to have a school with children from families of different and no religion(s). As this is the reality of the situation which is fairer in your opinion: One specific religion or no overall religion?

I would say that most parents are unaware they can opt their child out, as well as not really being aware that their child is getting the amount of religion they are in the first place - it varies from school to school and is not always as overt as ""My teacher told me that we're going to hell for not loving Jesus"". And as Lempert gives us an indication of the situation when someone does try and remove their child from the religious observances, it's not as easy as it should be.     
I don't think it's quite so easy to dismiss Lempert. Yes he was talking at the secular conference (I was there too, btw, though not a speaker of course) as he's also a member of the Secular Medical Forum. What exactly do you mean ""take it with a bit of salt"": That he's overstating what actually occurred? How or what situation would make you not take what a parent tells you about their experience ""with a grain of salt""?

If, as you posit, the problem is with the administration of education rather than the presence of religion, then why is it that (as far as I'm aware) no other schools are able to pick and choose as faith schools do with regards to which pupils they admit and which teachers they can employ (aside from the obvious that all schools can do)? How do other schools specifically avoid some areas of a syllabus and what motivations do those schools have to do so?

&gt; I disagree. There is a difference to me

If the state decreed that you had to attend a place of worship once a week of a religion that was not your own, would you object? If yes, why exactly would you object, after all you're not being forced to take part - all the state is making you do is attend?

On this programme, made by I believe the state funded BBC, said vicar quite openly described a fellow villager as Tory such and such, maybe even scum, can't remember but it was an insult. The supposed Tory was an awkward bald man, depicted as an arsehole and a bit of a cunt all in all.

I'm not saying the VoD is a prime cause, but the fact that such a harmless programme felt comfortable enough to espouse such views throughout the noughties speaks volumes.

We had a complete collapse of the Tories in97 leaving a huge vacuum which was filled by some sort of default cult for whoever filled it.

New labour were smart and pretty much a decade was spent maximising on the opportunity to shit on the Tories who were largely toothless during that period. Coupled with the concept of cool Britannia projecting the opposite image it's easy to see how many non typical labour supporters mindlessly fall back on evil Tory, Tory scum stereotypes.

It's because during their formative years they were culturally told that Tories were evil, snidey cunts who wanted to drink children's blood whilst Labour hung out with oasis and kept on showering money on special interest groups...

true,widgetas,null,null,"Given the limited funding available to education and public services in general, throwing more money at the problem really isn't an option. For example you must be aware that in recent months local councils have been made aware of and finally started dropping the extra funding they have been providing almost exclusively to children from religious families. i.e. Catholic Johnny got money for his bus fare to the nearest Catholic school (*not* the nearest school, mind) while 'atheist' Dave next door's parents had to pay to get him there. It seemed that most councils were unaware they were forking out millions (combined) to pay for this discriminatory service and most are moving to scrap it, or already have done so.

Saying ""Well X should happen"" when it *really isn't going to* is simply avoiding the issue.

Multi-faith - I'll repeat that half the population of Britain are apparently non-religious and of the remaining half, 56% are not overtly religious. Why then should schools reflect religion in *any* way other than history or RE?

&gt; I don't really care.

I'm guessing that, as a religious person, you haven't really thought about it from a non-religious point of view - that would be why you don't extend your secularism to education. That's not intended to be rude but really I don't think you're seeing it from my angle. You want your children educated in *some* religious way, but don't seem to consider that it is not fair on those who would rather no religious angle is given at all. You said ""Muslim schools are OK because they share similar core values to me."" Well good for you. Personally I don't want my child (should I have any) to be educated in a school that has any religious theme whatsoever. I live in the arse end of nowhere with only one school within travelling distance. What now?

I think that would also be why you don't seem to see a problem with children having to attend a religious ceremony.

&gt; I'd object massively if the state did this.

So yes, you would object. But you didn't tell me *why* you would object. What is it about your freedom that is different to a child?     
Parental wishes: Yes to an extent, but that's ignoring the reality of the situation: There might not be any other school nearby and parents do not always realise they *can* remove their child, as well as not always understanding what exactly their child is having to sit through. Also you're ignoring the testimony from Lempert: he is not alone in having had difficulty in removing his child from collective worship.

What is so wonderful and important about religious education/instruction when most people can live without it in later life?

WHY must religion be in charge of a school? If parents are religious then they'll instruct their children at home and go to their respective places of worship at the weekend or during the week too: What is so precious about the school day that there needs to be some religious influence in maths, science, English or art?",0,1324352030,null,0,false,0,c39jw54,t3_nhbml,t1_c39jw54,t1_c39joky,1428047613,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

true,[deleted],null,null,"When I said I didn't care I mean that if for reasons that I can't imagine only one school can be maintained, no denomination (secular, muslim jewish, not faith) is more entitledtto the monopoly than anyone else.

I would object to the state forcing children to go but that's not what's happening prents are through their chice of schools. i'm not going ot defend forcing people to send their kids to a school that has a religious element as i have said repeatedly. I do however maintain tha parents have a right to make their kids go to the school they choose until they're 16. 

Parent's don't know what goes on in the school? they should find out. presuambly they went to school and they talk to their kids. I'm not going ot get into 'some parents don't talk to they'r kids'.

&gt;Parental wishes: Yes to an extent, but that's ignoring the reality of the situation: There might not be any other school nearby ** i took 2 buses to go to high school and back everyday. if you don't like the school nearby then go somewhere else** and parents do not always realise they can remove their child **presuambly these are parents without your strong objection to a religious element to education or are broderline negligent**, as well as not always understanding what exactly their child is having to sit through **presumably these re parents who take no active interest in their kids lives**. Also you're ignoring the testimony from Lempert: he is not alone in having had difficulty in removing his child from collective worship **no, he had great ease in removing his kid but then objected to the consequences of this removal and objected that having asked for his daughter to be treated differently to everyone else she was treated differently to everyone else**.

&gt;Parental wishes: Yes to an extent

ok and beyond that extent what? who then dicates the terms? The state? You personally?

Look some people don't go to mass or mosque or strongly identify with a faith but still want or are indifferent to a religious element in their child's education. it's not because they're uniformed or because they are being kept down by an increasing weak organised religious framework. it's because they do not share your informed and vaild but ultimatly fairly extreme suspicion for religion in education. 

What is so wonderful and important about religious education/instruction when most people can live without it in later life?

Most people also get along well enough without shakespeare or alegbra later in life too. they're helpful for education though.

&gt;So yes, you would object. But you didn't tell me why you would object. What is it about your freedom that is different to a child?

Because i'm an adult and I'm capable of making my own welfare but children's welfare is ultimaty in the hands of their parents?

&gt;finally started dropping the extra funding they have been providing almost exclusively to children from religious families. i.e. Catholic Johnny got money for his bus fare to the nearest Catholic school (not the nearest school, mind) while 'atheist' Dave next door's parents had to pay to get him there.

this is the old equality of outcome versus equality of expense debate. i'm for equlity of out come ie do you need bus fare to get to the secular/ catholic school, then you shoud get it. Why does it matter that more is going to faith families rather than the other way around?

We're just going in circles. I'm not for a one size fits all education system. I think that faith can be helpful in building a child's values and i tihnk that thoe who agree ewith me have as much a right to educate their child in the manner of their chosing as people who argree with you. I think parent should be able to make their kids go to mass when they don't want to, and have baths when they don't want to. I do not think that state has this right though.

&gt;I live in the arse end of nowhere with only one school within travelling distance. What now?

Move, change you definition of travelling distance, consider home schooling, see if there are any state boarding schools that your child could attend (there are a few in th highlands of scotland), if there are others near you, you can start a free school or (as a person of faith with only one school which has your ideal curriculum would have to) consider home imporatnt that aspcet of your child education is to you. In short be a grown up an recognise that often ompromises must be made.

I really would be shocked if there was only one school in travelling distance. Where the hell do you live? No other schools for &gt;1.5 hours (what i did there and back to high school) in any direction?

 If that is the case then reality is going to have to hit you. You are the vast minority in your area. there is not a large body of people who like you think religon should play absolutly no part in education. You are the one dicating the special terms. 

I think the state should try to accomodate your choices as best they can, but this is like me saying 'why the hell should I, the only catholic in 50 odd miles, have to compromise in anyway? All the schools should be catholic and if people want to educate their children to be secualr humnist then that is what the evening and weekends are for!'

true,LokianEule,mccoy,Time's Champion,"First of all, watch the first one, An Unearthly Child (just part 1). You need to know where things started. And then watch Genesis of the Daleks.

I had tried to watch classic many times, failing with four different stories. Until I watched Genesis, then I began hopping all over classic. Now I've seen all of it and am onto the radio dramas. So watch Genesis, and *then* go chronological.

And now...

**William Hartnell, first**- The beginnings of the series. It needs forgiveness as it's very slow, and the Doctor is kind of a jerk at first, but there are some stories I really like. The Aztecs. It's a historical. Something DW doesn't do anymore.

 **Patrick Troughton, second** - Patrick Troughton is basically Matt Smith, but in the '60s. He's all silly/bumbly, but don't let that fool you, he kicks butt. His run is mostly missing thanks to the BBC but there are reconstructions. And they also suffer from '60s slowness. Watch: The Mind Robber. Tomb of the Cybermen. And if you can do reconstructions: Power of the Daleks. And the War Games last.

 **Jon Pertwee, third**- A weird run as most stories are on Earth (for story reasons explained). You meet the Master. This is when things really start to modernize and feel like they were made in the 20th century. Spearhead from Space, his first story. Inferno starts a little slow but picks up when the Doctor ends up in an alternate universe where everyone is evil. Like that Star Trek story. The Time Warrior introduces the famous companion Sarah Jane. Curse of Peladon, The Three Doctors, Day of the Daleks and last Planet of the Spiders are also good.

 **Tom Baker, fourth** The most famous run. This is when the writing enters a higher standard in Doctor Who. There are so many fantastic stories, and it's the run in which Genesis of the Daleks occurs. One of the most famous classic stories, and the one that got me into classic (above). So I say Genesis of the Daleks, Robots of Death, Face of Evil, Warrior's Gate, Deadly Assassin (for Time Lord history if anything), Horror of Fang Rock, Sunmakers, and of course lastly Logopolis.

 **Peter Davison, fifth** -Earthshock, Castrovalva (2nd half picks up), Kinda, Snakedance, Mawdryn Undead, Terminus, and Enlightenment. And The Five Doctors, which is the 25th anniversary special. EDIT: wait, how could I forget Caves of Androzani?! The last 5th Doctor story.

**Colin Baker, sixth** - Just want to say, Colin got fired. Poor guy. His Doctor is a drastic change with the flamboyant technicolor dreamcoat and bombastic crazy personality. If you can get used to him, he cracks you up and makes you laugh. He's a bit abrasive but so is the first doctor. His best is easily Vengance on Varos and Attack of the Cybermen, and Revelation of the Daleks. And if you want to try Trial of a Timelord (which is an entire season) it's pretty good. The Vervoid one is the weakest story I think. The sixth is the most underappreciated and maybe disliked Doctor. People say his era is crap, so when I went into it I was worried but pleasantly surprised. Because his era is NOT crap, it's only got a couple real stinkers, like any run does.

 **Sylvester McCoy, seventh**. Personally, my favorite Doctor. This is easy. Remembrance of the Daleks, The Curse of Fenric, The Greatest Show in the Galaxy, Battlefield. Good mention to The Happiness Patrol, Ghost Light, Silver Nemesis. This is the era where they really try some crazy radical stories.

Anyway, Foreman is just the name Susan got from the owner's sign at the junkyard at 76 Totter's Lane in London where her grandfather parked the TARDIS in 1963.  She needed a last name for school registration, after all!

Curious that Susan was never worried about the actual I.M. Foreman showing up to expose her as an impostor.  And his name was still on the property 22 years later.  So either he never discovered the squatters in his junkyard, or the old scrap merchant had met with some other fate before ""An Unearthly Child"" and they knew he wasn't going to return.  Hmm.

(Yes, I know other media have invented explanations for all these questions, but I prefer to go by only what's been shown on tv and consider the other stuff as not counting.)

1.  Mexican Food

2.  Dunkin Donuts Coffee

3.  Strip Malls - seriously, as much as I hated them in America, where I am in England you have nothing.  I can go to Tesco, or drive into Cambridge.  Not much options when looking for things.

4.  Lights on the expressways - outside of major junctions, they just aren't there.

5.  Good pizza, it's just awful over here, I now make my own because the best I found around me was goddamn pizza hut.

6.  proper breakfast sausage - you can find stuff close, but all their sausage seems to be at least 20% bread/fillers, best I've found has been from a farm shop near me.

7.  Any gum besides bubble gum, or mint gum.  and the only bubble gum isn't very good either.

true,Lozzy1256,null,null,"Well, the best place to drink and dance would be a nightclub. Most of them are charging quite a whack on New Years Eve though, so when you get here it might be an idea to have a walk around and look to see if you can still buy advance tickets. Also, everywhere in Edinburgh WILL be busy on Hogmanay, so don't worry about which club you choose, as long as you both like the music then you'll be fine. 

The street party is always fun, so why not try and get tickets to that? It finishes at about 1am, so there's 4 hours of clubbing time after that (and then the casino, and then brunswick bar which opens at 6am...)

For daytime activity, check out one of the billions of free entry museums we have. There's the National Museum which has just reopened after years of being mostly closed while they refurbed (HUGE T-Rex skeleton and an awesome interactive bit) The boyfriend and I have a thing for the childhood museum. We really love going there and getting all nostalgic. We always take visitors there. Lots of pretty toys from our youth (and we're early 20s) and even more from further back (I SO want one of the little boys spy kits from back in the 50s/60s!)

We've also got loads of galleries, the modern art one is about 20-30 mins stroll from princes street and is absolutely wonderful to go and look at, and if you want to be outside on a cold crisp winters day (if there are any) then they have huge gardens around both the buildings which are full of some pretty weird statues. It might be worthwhile looking to see if they've got any free tours on, because the boyf and I have been about 9 times now and still not seen everything, so it might be handy to have someone show you straight to the best bits - oh and their scones and tea (while slightly expensive) are gorgeous!

The portrait gallery has recently opened up again as well, I've not been yet but I've heard some really good things about it.

I'd recommend you try out one of the Highland Tours if your budget can stretch that far. There's a company called the Hairy Coo tour company that offers day bus tours to the highlands which you can tip the amount you thought the tour was worth in accordance to your budget at the end - be generous though!

And then there is Princess St gardens... At the moment they've got the Winter Wonderland/German Xmas Market there, which should be still there when you arrive, but I think it dissapears between xmas and new year, so get to it quick when you arrive. It's got some rides, and an outdoor ice rink, and the german marinated pork burgers are an absolute dream.

In terms of someplace to eat, make sure you try and find elephants and bagels - the best bagel shop in the history of the world (GUARANTEED!), and Illegal Jacks on Lothian Road is pretty awesome too!

If you're staying in a hostel then look to see if they're running some free pub crawls - most of them do, and that's a great way to find out about the city nightlife!

Hope this helps, I've got to get to college now, but if I think of any more I'll edit this when I get home :)

Hope you enjoy your stay in Edinburgh! :)

EDIT: Just remembered! We now (as of Thursday) have a Hotel Chocolat! Go in there when you're a bit chilly, it's on Frederick Street just off Princes Street, and get a hot chocolate from the cafe at the back. It's a bit steep at £2.75 for a tiny cup but my god it's worth it, and you wouldn't be able to drink any more than that - it's very rich!

As long as you turn to your fortnightly meeting, fill in your Jobsearch book and are polite and cooperative with the staff (read that as appear enthusiastic even though you have no intention of applying for the £0.10/h fast food place job) then you will normally be okay.  You might have to go to a few extra meetings now and again, to discuss your plans. rather than just a normal signing.

Most of the placements for work, training schemes etc didn't kick in until you had been claiming for at least a year.  You could get some help with training or courses, but it varies from location to location, and it should be explained at your first meeting (they probably won't) so just ask.  They also have a fund (Advisers Discretionary Fund) for helping you with clothes for interviews etc if you don't have.  It's not really advertised much.

There is no quota's for getting folk off benefits, I knew people that had claimed for 30+ years.  We wanted people to get into work, but you would only be refused benefits if you didn't meet the criteria for claiming or if you failed to bring in any evidence required to support your claim.  You can be kicked off your benefits for failing to sign, not fulfilling your Jobseekers agreement (agreed at your initial meeting) and a few other things, but normally you just reapply and you will get a hardship payment (it can get more complicated in some circumstances)

Hints and tips, make sure you have claimed housing benefit and council tax benefit if you live in your own place.  Cancel your direct debits if you can't afford them going out of your bank.  If you call the companies you pay to and explain, they will often or not give you some slack with things or help you out a bit.  Learn to cook, get a student cookbook or something, cooking cheap food makes your money go a long way.  You'd be amazed how many folk I dealt with that just bought expensive ready meals and wondered why they had no money left for electricity!  Keep busy with your time, use 9-5 for actually applying for jobs.  Handing out generic CV's is usually pretty shit, so tailor your CV's and applications to the job.  Apply for everything, you don't have to take the job, but it might be better than £67/week.  Lastly, don't get a crisis loan unless you are actually going to be made homeless or something.  They ruin people!

I'm a bit rusty, but if you have any other questions, fire away, I'll answer them when I get home from work.

When you start signing you will be told how many 'actions' you have to do per week, i.e how many looking for employment-related actions you have to do in order to keep your money.  
These actions can include the obvious applying for a job, but can also include looking on job websites, like the job centre one or your local paper, etc. They are supposed to be as many different actions as possible, i.e if you put that you looked in your local paper down for every action then they would get funny. But realistically there are only so many things you can do, especially with the ease of using the internet. So an action like looking on jobsites on the internet, can be put down several times assuming they are all different websites, if that makes sense? 


Be careful of work schemes, some claimants have been trapped into working in supermarkets for example. with a promise of a job at the end,  but no job appears and they are told that if they give up the work they will lose their benefits. If you are offered anything, always remember there is a 7 day cooling off period, check out on line or on here what scheme it is and what it entails. As I said most advisers are good, but there are some unscrupulous ones who will try and coerce you onto schemes so you can be put into a different box and the figures look better. 

Volunteering is a great way of getting experience and it looks good on CV, you will have to tell job centre you are volunteering, but you will still be expected to be available for and apply for work. 

Training wise, depending on what you want to do, and your age, there are some schemes out there run by the job centre, but AFAIK, if you are over 25 you have to pay half towards your training costs, which is an arse. No one can afford to pay half their benefit to train! 
Also there are some college/adult education courses that might be worth looking at, depending on what you fancy. You can get fee waivers or a much reduced fee for college/evening courses if you are on benefits. There are also sites like learn direct, which offer free courses, no idea what they are like or the levels but it is worth a look if it is free. 
Training/learning will keep the brain active too, daytime TV is designed to zap the IQ I think :-)

1 Always check that your money has arrived and if not, contact them immediately.

2 Don't spend hours on the phone it'll cost you. Their switchboard is dreadful, just pop into your local centre.

3 Do not miss any of the fortnightly interviews. If you need too, contact in advance if possible. Then check back with them. They will stop your money and they will not tell you.

4 Don't get bogged down by their attitude towards you. You are a human being and you are actively trying to get a job. Do not let anyone make you feel less than great.

5 Use the job machines while you wait for your interviews. The job machines were amazing for me because the website was buggy and I prefered having a print out with all information needed.

6 Apply for everything and always include a cover letter even if it isn't asked for.

7 Stay positive. What they pay you is shit but it's a lot better than nothing. There are jobs out there.

Biggest joke ever, I willingly got myself up at 7AM everyday and worked hard in the slightest chance that I would get the job (it was in media, an industry that is notoriously tough to get into at the mo). That wasn't good enough, as I had to be available to attend pointless interviews with a disinterested member of staff and/or interviews at the local minimum wage sinkhole.

Thank fuck I got offered a job at the end, and they paid me some expenses, otherwise I would never have been able to take up such an oppurtunity.

The Marbles were removed with permission of the owners and then paid for by the British public.  If Greece wanted to pay fair market value for them, I'd definitely put it to a *vote* of the people of the United Kingdom, the *current* owners of the Marbles.

One of the big reasons we must get fair market value and put it to a vote is that the Marbles are only a tiny portion of the archaeological wealth in Britain.  Treasure which the British public paid for and the UK man on the street pays to maintain and *owns*.

I'm all for creating an opportunity for these treasures to be restored in their original places, but talk of returning them to *Greece* or other items to *Egypt*, etc are lies.  Those countries simply did not exist.  The UK has existed continuously from the time of the acquisition of the pieces until now.  Are we going to start demanding that Italy return the wealth (human, mineral, cultural, etc) which was removed from Britain during Roman rule?  No, it's absurd.  

Again, put it to a vote and get fair market value - I'm all for it.  Gifting priceless treasures paid for and maintained and *owned* by the UK public to *anyone* is an absurd theft.

You cannot study them nearly so well when they are so far off the ground and attached to a building as you can when they are at eye-level, so that argument is invalid.  Also, they are perfectly accessible to scientists right now whereas returning them to the building will decrease their accessibility.

Also, returning them to the building will expose them to the elements.  Even if precautions are taken, they will certainly be more exposed then than now.

Enhanced technology and shipping allows manufacturers to locate themselves in the cheapest parts of the world and expand operations in the cheapest possible way.

While this transition has taken place however, the education system has stagnated and none of the recent governments have really taken an interest in reforming education. I don't propose education purely for employments sake, that would be bad, but I think there is a lot of room to develop skills that could be useful, but the opportunity is wasted with the exceptionally rigid 'curriculum'.

Perhaps the core problem is the fundamental acceptance of that one has to work to earn money, or rather; 'work' is a form of wealth distribution if I was to be somewhat loose about it.

That was a cost we voluntarily undertook and is irrelevant to the actual cost of the marbles. If anything the special requirements required to house them properly make them less valuable as there are fewer people who are able to take care of them.

1) Elgin is not the name of the person, that is the name of the estate of which Thomas Bruce was appointed Earl. 

2) £70,000 was his own personal expense. He was not instructed by the British government with some understanding of later payment. He took the marbles and sold them to the tax payer for £35,000. I don't think it's our responsibility to retroactively reimburse his estate for that.

This is true. We'd lose some tourism income, (although no doubt we would keep some rather excellent replicas before sending them home) but perhaps we'd gain in other ways?

Dont rely on the job centre to get you a job (the woman I signed on with was genuinely shocked that I was looking for one)

Make sure you keep a diary of what payments you have had, when they were recived and how much

Check to see how long you will be entitled to claim for as I was told that I could only claim for 6 months as I hadn't made enough tax contributions (I had been paying tax for at least 8 years)

If you have a partner (sometimes even living in a shared house) remeber that their earnings and savings are counted against you as they could be paying for you (This happened to me even though it was only my girlfriend that I was living with i.e not married or civil partnership)

Speak to Citizens advise if you have any bills that you are unable to pay (credit card etc) you should be able to make nominal payments untill you get back on your feet 

Dont be afraid to call anyone that you owe money and explain the situation to them 99% of them dont want to have to pester you for money and have depts that will be able to help you.

&gt; In the last chapters of this book, William St. Clair now adds further fuel to the controversy by revealing for the first time some disturbing details about the treatment of the Marbles while in the British Museum's care

For people that don't read books, [this](http://www.chron.com/opinion/outlook/article/Nagel-Playing-for-all-Elgin-Marbles-1971678.php) article provides a summary about Elgin. Tl;dr: he stole them (no permission), they knew it (no proper documentation), they bought them (no ethos).

&gt; Appointed Great Britain’s ambassador extraordinary to Constantinople in 1799, Thomas Bruce, the seventh Earl of Elgin and 11th Earl of Kincardine, asked the British government if it would subsidize a project to draw and make molds of antiquities on the Acropolis to help educate artists and the public in England (Greece was then controlled by the Ottoman Empire). The answer was no. He left for the Orient with his brand new, and very rich, bride, Mary Nisbet, whose own money would support the venture.

&gt; Elgin hired the Italian artist Giovanni Battista Lusieri to oversee the project, and in Turkey he obtained a “firman,” an official document signed by Sultan Selim III, authorizing the work to begin. Removing the sculptures was not Elgin’s original plan. But he was occupied with his duties in Constantinople, and delegated the job at the Acropolis to the Rev. Philip Hunt, his chaplain and on-site archaeologist. Hunt, in his enthusiasm to compete on Elgin’s behalf with other Europeans dragging home chunks of ruins as souvenirs, went to Constantinople seeking a more generous firman. He got it and, in July 1801, returned to Athens.

&gt; Later that summer, the British Army drove the French from Alexandria, recovering Egyptian territory for the Ottomans. The sultan, grateful to the English and wildly attracted to the glamorous Lady Elgin, honored the couple with extravagant trinkets and a permanent embassy at his own expense. Lady Elgin was even invited to Topkapi Palace to meet the power behind the throne — the sultan’s mother, or Valida Sultana — becoming the first Westerner invited to witness the opulence and mystery of the fabled harem. The Valida Sultana’s personal portfolio included the Acropolis — which, at that time, the Turks considered a slum.

&gt; In the spring of 1802, the Elgins finally got to Athens. Lady Elgin, pregnant with her third child, stayed to supervise her husband’s project while he went island-hopping. The first two firmans had already been passed on to local authorities, and Lady Elgin had subsequent firmans that authorized the sculptures’ removal.

&gt; She wrote to her husband that she “told Lusieri of the firmans, he says nothing can be going on better than everything, so for the present I shall lock them up.” She even wrapped some of the marbles for shipping herself, and persuaded two British Navy captains to disobey Lord Nelson’s orders and transport the cases to England.

&gt; Things went sour pretty quickly. In the winter of 1805-06, the British government began a 10-year wrangle over the marbles. Elgin was then a prisoner of war in France and Mary, in London, received a visit from officials who offered to take the marbles off her hands. She wrote him, “I desire them to make their offer, that it is impossible for me to fix any sum — I shall see what is said, it is always well to have that in one’s power.”

&gt; Two years later, Lord Elgin divorced his wife in two scandalous trials and an act of Parliament, bringing notoriety to them both. Mary lost custody of her children, and Lord Elgin lost access to his wife’s fortune, forcing him to sell the marbles. Appraisals ranged from 25,000 pounds from detractors to estimates as high as 100,000 pounds by the papal envoy, the sculptor Antonio Canova. (The average laborer then earned about 7 pounds a year).

&gt; Crown Prince Ludwig of Bavaria was reported to have given Lord Elgin a blank check. He asserted that gathering and shipping home the collection had cost him (or, more accurately, his wife) nearly 75,000 pounds, or what in today’s money would be equal to the purchasing power of about $4 million.

&gt; In 1816, the British government offered Elgin, then hugely in debt, 35,000 pounds — 18,000 pounds of it paid directly from the government to a creditor, and the balance earmarked for other creditors. Had he sold the collection abroad, he could have avoided his creditors, but he was intensely patriotic and refused to instigate a bidding war. He received neither profit nor fair value, yet for 200 years he has been denigrated as a crass commercialist.

&gt; Elgin’s reputation aside, several contemporary legal scholars make a strong argument for the Greek side in the current debate. David Rudenstine, the dean of the Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law, has forcefully argued that the 1816 parliamentary proceedings that affirmed the government’s purchase from Lord Elgin were tainted and incomplete.

&gt; According to Rudenstine, the July 1801 firman, which was not even produced at those hearings and has been publicly seen only in an Italian translation without the signature or seal of the sultan, did not give Elgin the authority to remove sculptures from the Parthenon walls, only to excavate.

There are indeeds subjects worthy of lengthy discourse and I see no problem with debating at length the greater questions of life, philosophy, politics, mathematics, science etc - these are weighty and important subjects indeed with much that can, has and will be said about them.

Stephen Fry's argument about the elgin marbles though is a simple (and in my mind, fairly unimportant) one. One that I personally feel could have been conveyed in far fewer words and without the unnecessary appeals to history and global politics. To stage your argument against the backdrop of ancient greece, the olympics and global political unrest is entirely unnecessary and personally I find it rather insulting as it serves to trivialise those things.

* The Bow Bar, (west Bow/victoria st) - really nice traditional pub, no music, no sport, some really good beers and a whisky range so extensive it requires a menu. unfortunately it's small popular and hasn't much seat space so gets crowded quickly and it can be really hard to get a seat at busy times. ~~Also no hand-pumps so no cask conditioned (real) Ale.~~ they use traditional air-pressure fonts which are a particularly Scottish thing apparently. Lear something new every day!

* Cloisters (26 Brougham Street) another nice traditional pub I find it a little less cosy than the Bow, but they have a nice menu of real ale, friendly bar staff and a real (gas) fire place!

* The Blue Blazer, (2 Spittal St) another of my favourite pubs. Very nice feel to it. Really cosy but often with quite loud music which bothers me some times also the staff can be a bit obnoxious when its busy.

* The Brauhaus, (105-107 Lauriston Place) the least traditional bar of the list and strictly speaking it's a German bar but they have the most phenomenal beer list I have ever seen (after the falling rock, Denver, CO.)

Lastly if you want to pick up some whisky, ether for your stay or for taking home, the best place to do it is my work (maybe I'm bias) Royal Mile Whiskies. Were one of the few shops on the royal mile that charges fairly (thats including The Whisky Trail just down the streets, we have so many customers that come in to us and say 'you're £15 cheaper than them down the road' (this is on £30-£40 bottles)).

So quit smoking it then, all you are partaking in is a bad habit. Instead of knowing that if you go to jail honest tax-payers will be paying for you to stay alive. Why not quit in advance of such a situation? 

In the UK as soon as you legalize a drug like cannabis people who wouldn't try it if it was illegal will thus try it, and before you know it you have double if not triple the smokers population. 

Part of the reason children say no to drugs etc is BECAUSE it's illegal, not cos they give a shit what their parents are saying to them. Besides, cannabis is a drug, and it alters the state of mind the user is in, so anyone who openly admits to being a regular smoker automatically has the credibility of their argument and even opinion diminished, just like it would if I came on here saying I was drunk.

Drug legalization WILL NOT work in the UK. It just won't. When the Netherlands made the step that everyone seems to think was the outright legalization of cannabis (it wasn't). Do you think they legalized it based on what stoners thought?


I do like how stoners compare marijuana to alcohol though, ironically, one drink and one spliff are so far apart in terms of the affect it has on the human body, and the damage it causes, it's a joke. Your liver regenerates, your lungs, brain and eyes don't.


Well on come the downvotes, most of reddit are stoners seemingly.


E: I find it funny, the UK can't control what comes INTO the country, how is it going to control what goes out of it? The fact most of you mention drunk people acting like pricks shows why legalizing any drug is a bad idea in the UK.

I'm refering to limited 'now-and-again' use of each subjects. Cannabis is a known mental disturber altering the chemicals for people in different ways.

Alcohol has the SAME effect for EVERYONE other than allergies of course, the only difference is alcohol itself is addictive, thus some people become addicted and most people don't.

I'm not supporting alcohol in favour of cannabis in anyway, if I had it may way, they'd all be banned but it doesn't really matter which drugs are legal and which aren't, your countries people are still going to be EXACTLY the same. 

Your comments come across like you smoke cannabis as a way to protest that alcohol is still legal, but if alcohol was illegalized you'd still smoke regardless. The fact you are willing to do something that is against something written in our law shows that you're acting morally wrong in relation to the laws we have currently. If I had full control over a country I sure as hell wouldn't give into something that was illegal just because x ammount of people were doing it. I'd just do my upmost to put a stop to it.

&gt;In the UK as soon as you legalize a drug like cannabis people who wouldn't try it if it was illegal will thus try it, and before you know it you have double if not triple the smokers population.

Everyone claims this in every country that is considering decriminalisation in some form, and Portugal provides a good counterpoint. As expected there was a slight increase in the number of people who would smoke weed occasionally, and dramatic fall in the number of regular users (this was born out with other drugs as well) and overall consumption, as well as consumption by children. And unless you ideologically believe that smoking weed is bad, and that if you try once then you're lost forever, then this is a positive outcome. This is exactly what would happen in the UK, you simply don't have any evidence to suggest otherwise. 

Sending a substantial number of people to prison simply based on ""I reckon"" type opinions is just not good enough. If you can't provide evidence, and I mean proper evidence generated from experiments with controls and a null model, then the laws should be scrapped.

Drug legalization WILL work in the UK, though the Dutch model is the wrong approach; we need something like the Portugese model - harm reduction is the most important thing, not levels of consumption.

true,Kidsturk,davison,Davison,"Read my comment again assuming I know everything you've said in your comment. Does it still make sense? Yes?

What I meant was - there are many parallels between the Doctor and Sherlock Holmes. They are both always the most intelligent man in the room, and often formulate plans that hinge on details either too obscure or entirely unknown to those around them. As a result, they are prone to showboating and theatre, the same form of affectionate admiration from readers/viewers, and they are accompanied by everyman characters (Watson/Companions) with whom the viewers/readers can more easily relate and who carry the proxy of wonderment and/or confusion.

On a deeper level, Moffat's Sherlock and his Doctor are almost over-intelligent, struggling with the disjoint between their racing brains and the limits of how they're forced to communicate and interact with lesser mortals and the world around them, which opens up a sort of sympathetic pity angle - Eleven's embarrassed shiny faced schoolboy act and Sherlock's raging boredom.

How's that for a clearer argument?

ROFL. I think that River's story is pretty tied up, and Dandelion has already explained the reverse thing so that's all good.

I think that she should remain in her computer world in the library though. Everything ends, everything has its time. Bringing back River would be like Bringing back Rose in series 4. It just doesn't really work. Of course the series 4 finale was very fan service-y anyways (Davros!).

Speculation? I think that the Doctor is the Other and I think that at some point he was/is/would've/could've been half-human. And then it was explained.

I was physically sick after both of those.

You mention Gerrard and I can promise you that you've seen one of the best to ever wear the shirt in your time too. You're also seeing one of our best ever 'keepers at the moment - the best since Clemence (but Brucie will always be dearest to me). It's a shame you missed King Kenny in his pomp - he and Rush were awesome - and the days of Barnes and Beardo were [fantastic](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wY3cJwsRttY). Of course, God deserves a mention - some days he was like watching a superhuman scoring machine. You've probably also seen one of our greatest matches - the 2006 FA Cup win over West Ham was better even than the two 4-3's we had over Newcastle for me.

On the other side, I've also lived through the misery of Heysel and our subsequent isolation from a Europe we would have dominated. I can clearly remember watching events at Hillsborough unfolding on Teletext and just being numb. Seeing the fall of our team was also hard - you can't be on top forever but watching them decline in the early 90's was hard.

She was born at Demon's Run, taken by the Silence as an infant where she was trained and brainwashed. At some point during her training, she was shot by Amy where she endured a somewhat serious injury. She regenerated into Mels, who was then placed in Amy and Rory's neighborhood where she was Amy's childhood friend. She remained there until she met up with them in ""Lets Kill Hitler"" where she finally tried to kill the Doctor (due to the influence from the Silence). She gets shot on accident, and regenerates into her third form, River Song. She is won over by the Doctor's charm, falls in love with him, and uses her last regenerations to save the Doctor fro dying. 

She then goes to study Archeology at the Luna University in the distant future. While going through her studies, she is met again by the Silence, who take her to Lake Silencio to kill the Doctor. She ends up splitting time in half by both killing and not killing him, creating the alternate universe season in the S6 finale. She marries the Doctor, heals the time rift and goes through with ""killing him"" (him being the Tesselector). She is then imprisoned at Stormcage Containment Facility. She continues to have adventures with the Doctor at this point (Impossible Astronaut, Pandorica Opens, Time of Angels), though he is knowing less and less about her as they continue to meet. Her final meeting with the Doctor occurs after she is released from prison and has become a professor. She travels to the Library, seeks the Doctor's help, and ends up sacrificing herself to save him. She is saved as a data ghost in the Library mainframe. In her timeline, this is the last moment we see of her. 


So basically, any future episodes with River song will take place somewhere in between all this. I'm assuming, to avoid major confusion, it will be during her imprisonment because this seems to be a stable enough time for her to be present in the Doctor's life.

BBC typically does 6 episodes in a season. However they call it a series and as they did with who will usually split it up if it's more than that. They also don't mind ending a show after 6 episodes that tell a complete story like they did with Jekyll (also by moffat and I highly recommend)

BBC also likes to do a lot of longer specials during the year especially christmas time. All this combines to make the time of year things air jump around a bit. However, unlike American shows the BBC usually doesn't preempt programming or skip a week for ratings reasons.

true,cptzaprowsdower,null,null,"I prefer to judge the series on its own merits, so I'm not sure how useful it is to compare it to other shows. TV dramas that have the aspirations of dealing with complicated themes are sorely lacking and Black Mirror should be commended for at least trying to do something differently. But just because there is a dearth of programming with the ambitions of Black Mirror doesn't make Brooker's show good by default. IMO (and maybe I'm wrong) it feels like people are praising this show for what it *tried* to do rather than for what it *actually* accomplished.

But with that disclaimer out of the way, I thought Dead Set was much better. It's an obvious comparison, but it makes an excellent companion to Dawn of the Dead; there was an interesting enough central message but this was never allowed to be communicated at the expense of the narrative. In each, the message came secondary to writing a gripping, funny and pacey overall narrative, which is as it should be. 

In contrast, every single second of episodes 2 and 3 of Black Mirror screams its message at the viewer. Even the first episode (which was easily the best of the lot IMO) couldn't manage to make it to the end without directly telling the audience what to think; after the princess is recovered the government guy laments the reason no one noticed her pottering around London was because **""Everyone was too busy watching screens**"" (or something like that). I find that massively condescending to the audience. After spending an hour building a gripping story with the undercurrent of an inclination towards a certain message, Brooker resorted to smashing our heads open with a sledgehammer and pouring the message directly into our brains with that clumsy piece of dialogue, presumably because we're all too stupid to have come to our own conclusions. As a series, I think it was guilty of underestimating its audience and explicitly spelling out what we were supposed to take from each episode in a way that more mature dramas wouldn't/shouldn't have.

If you live in a place you can fund with housing benefit/CT benefit, have a decent computer to keep you occupied, have clothes and shoes to last you year round, have pots and pans to cook with, have access to a proper kitchen and a fridge, have access to a freezer, have access to tools for hobbies like wood working, have access to nature for resources, have had access to education to perhaps expand on, have access to good physical and mental health… basically, the more you have going in the (unsurprisingly) easier it gets to get through it.

Pots, kitchen, fridge and freezer are the most important aspect, since food will be your largest expenditure. The more flexibility you have for preparing and storing food (in bulk if need be), the more you can take advantage of seasonally low prices and special offers. Having a library near by and access to a computer help enormously to find recipes and techniques as well. You can feed yourself quite healthily and easily for under £3/day, as I found out when I was on the dole for a few months a while back; I'm positive I could've shave 50p/day off that if I tried harder, possibly even more but not so sure there — but that was with a proper gas hob, oven with assorted trays, a slow cooker and a large fridge-freezer in place.

That left me with around £30/week to dick around with, which is, *again*, where what you own makes or breaks it. Is there a council gym near you? A decent library? A swimming pool? Public foot paths to go rambling in? Do you have the OS maps to find them? Access to a computer to find them? Access to a computer for entertainment? You're not going to be going clubbing much, but it's enough for a few pints down the pub every other week and even the odd take away without breaking the bank.

&gt;the fact remains that the U.S. tends to set standards that the rest of the world usually follows and you can be sure that if SOPA passes in it's current form in the U.S., you will see similar legislation introduced in Parliament.

I think you grossly overestimate the influence the U.S.A. has in Europe especially mainland and northern Europe, granted it might be the case in  the U.K. (but hopefully Scotland will be well out of that within the next 5 years). Also, the whole 'land of the free' thing is nothing more than a dead memory and was little more propaganda to start with. People may still buy into that nonsense in American, but if we Europeans ever did, we sure as hell don't now.

You claim that  ""they do not choose"" to turn to stone, which can be true, but isn't necessarily the only truth, and in fact can't be the only truth as what we see seems to contradict this. It is not ever stated that they *can't* choose to be stone, which is essentially what we see happen. The ability to to turn to stone is a defense mechanism, so if there is a danger to them that can not see(like a crack in the wall), then why not turn to stone to try and save oneself from it. Let's consider a horrible hurricane and a single weeping angel, with no one around to observe them (except maybe itself) then how is the angel to defend itself against natural disasters? The angels are supposed to have the most perfect self defense mechanism, so i think that this would make sense.
Although River did say that the angel was creature that could never ever die, but perhaps it can still feel pain?
A strobe effect could also be possible if the angels are quickly going from being looked at to not looked at. Since there are many angels around in the scene then one could easily go from looking at the other angels, cover it's eyes, then the other angels could move look at the first angel, cover there eyes...to infinity....?
I wish they didn't show the angels moving.
Here's another thought, the human eye can only see at so many frames per a second, so in between these frames the angels could theoretically move.

The buses were constantly late, or never turned up at all. It was like a fun game to play waiting at the bus stop; ""Will they or wont they turn up!"". A number of times the bus has broken down while I'm on it too. They have an absolute fucking monopoly so it seems they don't even try.

Weirdly the experience in Norwich wasn't too bad at all. They were fairly cheap and the buses in my experience were never late. Then again Norwich has a few companies providing services... competition really does drive up quality.

Here in York First provides one of two services that service the University, the other being York Pullman. I tend to use both evenly; First is nearer to my accommodation but Pullman is nearer to my department. Both have the same price structure, so you can't compare on that, but I have noticed the First buses are nearly always late. They are supposed to be every ten minutes or so from 9am till 6pm, but I've waited for half an hour quite a few times with no buses turning up. And then usually the most hilarious thing happens when about three buses all turn up at once. *Why!?* Service is even worse in evenings and nights.

The USA has a decisive lack of plugs available at Home Depot.  They come molded to cords instead of being changeable by the consumer. Not all extension cords are compatible with three prong power cords.  I also gripe that there's usually no fuse in plugs, and the connection to the wall is very loose (unsafe). Light switches in many homes are still the old toggle up/down switches that went out in the 1970s and they are still available for sale as the standard switch option. 

Hydronic radiant heating systems are seen as an unusual 'new' concept in the US (well, where I am they are, anyway). When talking hydronic systems, mentioning a combination boiler for hot water and heat together gets a 'wow'.  Suggesting putting radiators on your wall gets a resounding 'nope'.

An average American roof lasts 20 - 30 years.  The roof on my house in England was 150 years old. I had never heard of anyone totally replacing a roof outside of a natural disaster. 

I can't find a hover mower anywhere.  Flymos apparently don't work on American grass species so don't bother importing one either. 

Cars are often seen pulling caravans around the UK.  Never seen a car pulling one in the US.  It's like Americans have been told they can't do it with less than a V8 truck.  I see 'travel trailers' for sale that a 4 door sedan would easily pull - but never seen a 4 door sedan pulling one.

I had fun trying to describe what a tea strainer was at our local supermarket - 3 different staff members had no idea what one was.  I eventually found one in the same store and it was even called a tea strainer on the box. How does someone grow up not knowing what a tea strainer is?

With regards to food, there's no 'proper' sausages (i.e. not Italian, Hot Dog or Bratwurst), pork pies, pasties, etc.  and in an aisle of salad dressings the size of Britain there's no salad cream.

true,HesBehindYou,null,null,"Its not actually the police saying any of this. It's HMIC which is completely different. The idea being they over see the police along with individual police authorities and the IPCC. The live ammunition is a recommendation they have made. Its a complete con and a trick. 

Police are able to open fire when they perceive there to be a credible imminent threat to life. So the law won't change. Someone trying to set fire to a building which is believed to have people inside (ie a block of flats or some such) could still potentially be shot as is. However in a riot based scenario its very unlikely to happen, at least not with live ammunition. HMIC know this and when you drive a desk its very easy to make recommendations willy nilly. The justification has always come from the individual armed officers who fire the shot. Nothing will change. All HMIC have said is ""hey you could do that in the riots."" Personally I think the use of AEP (baton round) would be far more likely in that scenario. Since the law is not going to change, defence of life and property being very well established under common law for centuries this cannot be seen as a ""power grab."" Especially not when you're still subject to the criminal law.

The HMIC report misses the point in its entirety. If you stop letting criminals off all the time in court, things like this wouldn't happen. People committing GBH and getting community service. Fines which are never paid, ""tags"" which are breached night after night. If your on court bail and you have conditions to be in your house from say 22:00 to 07:00 and you're found on the Raz at 02:00 and are arrested for breach of bail you'll be put before the court again and the most likely thing they will do? Nope not remand you or put your on tag, they're most likely to remove the conditions from your bail. Its in your interest to break court bail. If the sort of people who do this sort of thing thought ""hmmm the consequences might be a bit heavy"" they are less likely to do it. 

In any case, I suppose the above is not what HMIC is really concerned with. There is no point HMIC saying more AEP, more live rounds and so on and so forth because it will never happen. In the command structure you have a Gold, Silver, Bronze. They are typically high ranking officers and very often chasing the next rank. Authorising AEP would scupper their chances so they would be extremely reluctant to authorise its use at all. The organisation is too scared of its own tail to deploy it in case of getting sued anyway. So again I say its all very well and good HMIC pontificating about it from behind their nice safe desks but it won't be authorised for use. 

It doesn't really need all this anyway. Any police officer you speak to knows this. The good old fashioned baton charge works very well. But again Golds and Silvers are too scared to allow it to be done because someone will get hurt. Hence you see the ""stand off and contain"" tactic. Needless to say, that doesn't really work. 

The real solutions are very simple. More public order/shield trained officers, actually utilising current powers. Organisation stops tripping over itself to find someone to apologise to for use of force. On the first night rioting spread, 8,000 officers were mobilised by the second evening you had 16,000 on duty. The will was there but once again ""lions lead by donkeys"" would seem to be the key phrase.

I've recruited for both a Scottish company and an English company and the attitude, skill level and work ethic of the NI folks that i've seen is head and shoulders above the english or scottish counterparts.  Where I work there are 5 or 6 of us from NI in a division and we're by far and away the most highly thought of in the whole division.

Also, when I worked in NI the pay was pretty shit, by moving to an english company i've doubled my salary. If i went freelance I could quadrouple it again.

From what I've seen in NI, there ARE jobs, fine if you want to do 1st level support for citigroup.  Just a very small process monkey in a very big machine that will pay you for 35 hours a week but expect 50+ with NO prospects.
If you want to do something creative (and i'm talking, writing software) there are very few places doing this. Its all the menial shitty jobs that are one stop away from being in chenai or Mumbai.

The removal was completed in 1812. The Greek Revolution started in 1821, while there were many prerevolutionary movements. The Kingdom of Greece was established in 1832. The new independent state was/is the legal successor in the area of Athens. Greece never stopped requesting the sculptures.

By this expression I understood the Porte to mean that **the persons who had sold the marbles to your Lordship had no right so to dispose of them**.

Don't get me wrong. I have worked with some great people here. That seems to be the problem though. We have just run out of great software dev's since they all move away or are kept extremely happy by their current company.

I was involved in hiring in a small firm outside Belfast that offered rather creative jobs and very difficult technical problems. Over the period of several months very few people applied and the ones that did could not pass the basic's of technical tests.

The jobs do exist. However the recruitment company love the revolving door attitude of the ""support teams"" like citi and will quite happy accept the churn of people rather than actually setup the great people with great companies. This results in it being very hard to actually get great people without going by word of mouth. so much so I think it is impossible to get a really great dev job without going by word of mouth.

I also was guided to a similar situation by a recruiter and then spend 5-6 weeks guiding myself back out of it again :)

I had to pray that GNER didn't cock-up our connecting train because getting on late with the wrong ticket time is *criminal*.

I had plans, a hotel, taking my son to the Dr Who Experience, meeting up with friends and all of it was me dancing to the tune of the train companies. The fear you have of ruining your month by being a little late means you spend ages making sure you are ridiculously early because the alternative is unthinkable.

This fare increase is just a further lean on the lever pushing people towards booking months in advance but never bothering with turn-up prices.

I think there is a general misconception ITT that we sent people to prison for possession of drugs.

In fact the Home Office themselves issued a document last year showing [their procedure on drugs](http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/publications/alcohol-drugs/drugs/drug-strategy/) with the strapline:

Then obviously Smith came along with Moffat and a whole load of other new people, and they had completely different styles from the previous cast and crew.

On average at any one time you have 1 in 10 of them public facing. 1 in 5 PCs and Sergeants are Level 2 Public order trained (ie able to put on flame proof overalls and use shields and so on to tackle disorder). I think the problem should be self evident. So what you really need to worry about before things like water cannon and AEP is getting that number up to more like 1 in 2 and recruiting more officers. Go back to 1950 and you had about 17 crimes to each officer, now its 1 for 44.  Not to forget now we see a lot more missing persons, mental health issues, domestic incidents and so on. Theresa May said ""I want the police to cut crime, nothing more nothing less."" Great sound bite but who else looks for missing children? Also with section housing and so on gone, rapidly mobilising a large section of the police is much harder when many have to commute. What could be done in an hour or less now realistically takes two, maybe more.

Look at the courts and time and again, repeat offenders are let off, sticking their fingers up at the arresting officer as they leave court. Fines do not get paid by these people, So they have to be dealt with again, again they refuse to pay, so again they are arrested. A magistrate will say ""If you're not going to pay we're going to keep you in custody for a day, minus time spent in a police station, which was one day, off you pop."" What message does that send?

The first point that video raises is that they inherit it, which is no different than todays passing on the wealth, the only difference is the royal family's size of property passed down after death is much bigger than our next of kins.  Also, Kings, Queens and even Lord Protector's earned their land through conquest, and was required in order to provide men and crops for further conquest.

Point Two, Yup I guess the Monarch did build up a debt, but did you forget that the King was also responsible for paying for all the civil government, and as the government expanded as too did the costs which the king (george 3rd) could not cover with just the land and feudal rights, so lent the rights to the profits to the parliament and also gave up responsibility of paying for the civil government, this is why in exchange for the profits of the land the Monarch owns, the Parliament approve a Civil List payment, and yes the Two Dutchys are except (but all profits are subject to Income Tax) as they provide both public and charitable as well as private funds to the Soverign, and you know the Monarch uses the private funds to fund expenses incurred (on both official and unofficial) by members of the public family. 
So Point two, yes no Inherence Tax, but why would the government tax themselves?


Point Three where that video go on about Darwin, See above for inherence Tax, The crown estates are both public and private lands so just selling all 7Billion would be one terrible idea, a 3% vs private industry's 5% is still not to be sniffed at (and while were at it, The Crown Estates is regulated by Parliament and will be getting looked at by ministers into doing more for public, and you I think I'm willing to let that 2% difference slide as a by-product of being regulated).  Also, as for the 10Million extra debt every year, it is really their fault the Government is terrible at saving?


Point 4 the French Castle is bigger and visits are not restricted, Winsor Castle is smaller and the public area is much smaller, and as it is a living area tours are restricted and scheduled, And I'm sorry I didn't know we were comparing the worlds largest Art gallery to a Palace where only Invited guests are allowed and is opened for only 60 days to the public.


Not really going to argue about point 5 about the 7000 Million etc etc, but a large portion do visit London for the history. 

Also, the UK has the largest Social division? I think not, try asking the haves and have-nots in America.

* People harm other people more under prohibition than legalisation
* People harm themselves more under prohibition than legalisation
* Morality doesn't really come in to it.

_Dependency_ isn't  choice, certainly, drug _use_ is a more (or less) free choice - bearing in mind issues like social and cultural group, peer pressure, etc.  Particular drugs and routes of administration are more (or less) 'sticky', and certain users are more (or less) vulnerable to becoming 'stuck'.  

If I strapped you down over a course of several weeks (in an entirely non-sexual scientific experimental kind of manner!) and forcibly injected you with heroin, at the end of the experiment, you would undergo the normal physical heroin withdrawal symptoms (like a dose of the flu etc.), but you most likely wouldn't feel the same kind of hopeless urge to continue using that most addicted users do, and you would have a much much better chance of never using again as a consequence.  That tells you that bio-chemistry isn't the primary factor (though it's obviously one factor).

Ie their employers can't penalise them if they take time off to deal with these things. You could across London then mobilise an extra 3000 or so officers at short notice. More level 2 public order training, increase the numbers, it is not that expensive. The Gold, Silver, Bronze command system works well, however we need a system whereby Gold and Silver trust their bronze commander more and are more willing to give the go ahead with tactical options. On the policing side, its all pretty common sense. 

On the court front, give out strong sentences. Use the sentencing powers they have, to send people to prison where they should be. They managed it during the riots, we can manage it the rest of the time. Currently keeping someone in a YOI (youth offenders institute) for a night costs more than a night in your average luxury hotel. So again sort that side of things out. Remove the private contractors that take the piss and let the state run it. 

On the subject of domestics, unfortunately yes. We must. Often with abusive partners it starts as an argument. Every couple rows and often we have to deal with that and they wonder why and see it as an intrusion (as would I) because they're a happy normal couple. If we don't intervene then people do get hurt. Most domestics are between people who are drunk or on drugs. Either they are drunk as your average person might be after a party or what have we or more typically are habitual drinkers or drug abusers. We have people who have domestics all the time. By that I mean police can get called to their rows 3 or 4 times a day. Despite being told to separate for 24 hours or dealt with as a breach of the peace. I'm not sure these new powers the Government are proposing are really going to help.  

With regard to the mentally ill. You do need some police presence because of the fact they can be very unpredictable and potentially very violent indeed. Often the actual removing them from the street (so to speak) is the easy bit. Getting them into a suitable hospital is very often the hard bit. If they've been drinking the mental health professionals won't have them.  Even if there is only a slight suspicion of very mild amount of alcohol, or drugs or if they are involved in any crime. They then have to be held by police for however long holding up resources. Even in the most straight forward cases admittance can take hours, often leaving a van and a car off the road for that time. Really what it needs is for police to be in a position where the above is a streamlined process and it doesn't take hours. If its not the police doing it, its the ambulance service doing it. More typically, both.

With regard to your last points I find the only one I have any real disagreement with (then it is minor) is the last one. These courses are available. Maximum term a magistrate can give is 6 months. Lets say you're a criminal who can't read and you actually get given 6 months. You'll be out in more like 2 and a half. The waiting list to get on a reading course is 3 months. So its there, it just needs to be more available. Sentences need to be served fully.

They're not afraid of being seen, their ability takes care of that problem. They are afraid of the crack/explosion, they don't really know what it is and they are trying to protect themselves from it and figure out what the crack actually is. We see the angels return later saying that they need to through the Doctor in the crack to close it. Perhaps they are able to say something like this because of their very careful and focused analysis of the crack. In fact that seems to be all they are focused on at all (so certainly not Amy) as they forget the *gravity* of the situation that they're in. 

If the Daleks were running away from a danger, or analyzing a threat, they wouldn't be concerned with exterminating a blind amy either, unless of course she drew too much attention to herself and was distracting.

Now the reason the Doctor says the angels don't kill doesn't make much sense, but I think the actual action of the angels can.

Let's see if we can make sense of the actions: he's says they aren't attacking since they don't know amy can't see?

Even if we say ""No visiting your past self"", nothing stops you from meeting other people's past selves.  The Doctor met River out of order, visited Rose prior to her adventures with him when he was saying goodbye, and then there's the Face of Boe.  You can cross other people's timelines however you like.

Let's say that the Master died, FOREVER, when he was 1,000 years old.  Does that mean that the things he did in prior adventures never happened?  Of course not, they still happened, there just won't be any new adventures.  But what if he had adventures when he was, say, 800...that haven't yet happened to the Doctor?  Heck, the 11th Doctor could have been there when the Master first decided to go evil!

Cumberbatch's Sherlock is, in his own words, a ""high functioning sociopath"".

His only interest is in solving truly challenging criminal puzzles, and he will blithely and even cruelly manipulate anyone if needed to further that goal. Probably the only reason he's refrained from killing anyone or committing other serious crime is because the legal repercussions of that would severely curtail his ability to find and solve more criminal puzzles.

Smith's Eleventh Doctor is more of a high-functioning autistic or Aspergery sort. He's brilliant, a bit obsessive yet absentminded, and he has deep care and concern for others as fellow sentient beings, but he doesn't quite ""get"" people, especially in relation to himself. He has a sort of anthropological understanding of humans at best, affectionately observing and understanding us with aloof fascination, much as Goodall did with gorillas. He may recognize our interpersonal politics, but he doesn't quite see himself as ""one of us"" or how he might fit into our social dynamic.

My hope is that any punishment administered to Luis Suarez has been guided by this spirit. My fear is that this has not been the case.

A few weeks ago the penultimate set of games in the Brazilian championship was named the ""Round against Racism"". All over the country teams had their photo taken behind a banner saying ""Say no to racism. Racism is a crime"".

The measure, though, was not accompanied by any attempt to stimulate a debate on the subject - on why there are so few black coaches, for example, or on taking legal action when members of the crowd make monkey noises, as occasionally happens in Brazilian stadiums.

The impression was that the Brazilian FA were playing politics. Its president Ricardo Teixeira had fallen out with Fifa boss Blatter. When Blatter put his foot in his mouth on the racism issue, Teixeira saw his opportunity.

""The Round against Racism"" was nothing of the sort. In reality, cynically and opportunistically, it was the ""Round against Blatter"".

The English FA have now left themselves open to the same accusation of cynicism. What Suarez is alleged to have done is wrong. To draw attention to the colour of someone's skin in a manner that could be construed as pejorative is not acceptable in our reality.

There is a clear case for punishment as part of a process of education. But the eight-game ban would seem to go much further. It smacks of the FA seizing on a chance to score a political point.

For me though, that ""smashing out heads open... and pouring the message ... into our brains"" was a result of a script that had been written to follow a concept.

I actually just ignored that line about ""everyone to busy watching the screens"". I thought the episode's concept was ""What would happen if a prime minister had to fuck a pig on tv, to save someone's life."" and the tacky message you took exception to was just the motivation of the demented artist (who fucking killed himself).

2 experiences recently would be when I bought a £4.20 day saver early morning as I knew I'd be using it to get to and from work then to use to get in to town later for a night out. The ticket machine messed up somehow and basically cut up my ticket as though somebody had cut randomly in it with scissors. When I said to the driver this was unacceptable and could I have another, he just kind of shrugged his shoulders and said ""you can still use it, it's got the date on it"" .... customer service at it's worse

The second happened when I asked a driver about road closures near where I get off to go for work. Long stort short the whole road was to be closed from 9pm Friday until 6am Monday and I was due to get an early bus to work on the Saturday. Apparently they would be taking an alternative route so I asked the driver where it would be stopping.

The drivers looked blankly at me and just pointed outside and kept repeating ""timetable, timetable"" ... it took me a few seconds and asking him again (only to be looked at blankly again and to be told ""timetable, timetable"") to realise he couldn't speak English and didn't understand me.

Now, I don't want to sound like I'm being a racist but wouldn't an essential part of a bus drivers job to be able to understand his passengers? Especially when someone unfamiliar with the area maybe asking about a fare or if they go to a certain area? It baffles me

true,busstopboxer,null,null,"I don't think we're yet in a position to sustain so many ""CL level"" players, so yes I would seriously consider taking him. I think he has a bit of quality - more than most are giving him credit for, his finishing and interplay have been excellent of late - and more importantly he's got the physicality to give our truly world class players room to work - defenders can't ignore him to concentrate on Bale and VdV as they can Pav a lot of the time.

I think he's at a stage in his career where he could be happy as a second fiddle in a team that is truly competitive, and he would be relatively cheap to acquire and pay. He has tons of PL experience so we would be avoiding bringing in a player who ends up never quite adjusting to the league (as has happened with Pav really). I think this is a particularly important point to consider when it comes to a player who won't necessarily play week in week out.

What really bothered me is the amount of ex servicemen who've served their country yet they've been left out to dry by the very establishment they gave their lives to, a lot of them still suffering from PTSS, now that to me is truly fucking shocking.

Now what Crisis achieves is a great thing; they feed them, nurse them, clothe them, give them a haircut, an MOT and a place to rest for a week but you've got to remember that once Christmas is over these people are right back to where they started in the worst month of the year ( January ) Now I'd like to see a correlation on how many homeless die from despair in that month alone because I can guarantee it'll be a lot. 

What London needs is an all year round version of Crisis to be honest, because I don't think the once a year version is anywhere near enough.

The acting in ep 1 was sub-par in some bits, and the premise was so ridiculously over the top I couldn't grant the other relatively minor faults a pass. It was just silly. The second ep never really allowed me to suspend disbelief because of the cheesy graphics and disconnected story line, which I just thought was too contrived and implausible. 

However, this last one was pure Brooker genius. I absolutely loved it. The way the technology was portrayed was sufficiently subtle to allow me to suspend disbelief for the sake of being immersed in the narrative. With the incredibly rapid pace of development for personal digital recording devices that I've see happen over the past 2 decades, I really can believe that a technology like the one portrayed here isn't so far distant into the future as to make thinking about what it might look like and its implications absurd.

The acting was pretty convincing, and the premise was truly fascinating and believable. Ie. how would you avoid becoming such a loathsome, controlling prick like the protagonist(?) if you really did have the ability to audit memory with perfect fidelity? I REALLY enjoyed the nuance of the the show's argument that he clearly was a guy with decent ethical impulses (the initial interview scene, the remorse of the post-fight scene) who, as a result of a jealous disposition magnified by his artificially eidetic recall, just couldn't resist allowing the capabilities of such a powerful technology to turn him into a tragic villain.

In part it was due to awkward delivery companies &amp; me being a little awkward to deliver to. It's fine if they use royal mail / parcel force. I'm probably not going to be in when they deliver (I work 9-5) &amp; where I worked wasn't a great place for delivery (huge site with a central goods in depot which sometimes proved to be a bit of a black hole), but they leave it at the local post office or the depot where I can go and collect it at a sensible time.
However Home delivery network, has no particularly local depot, and only deliver 9-5 (or 9-7 maybe? but unable to give you a window within that), and only offer depot collection 9-5. If you are 9-5 you are out of luck pretty much. This is the company amazon use for a lot of their larger deliveries. The weather screwed them up, and gave them a huge backlog. Once they resumed delivery, they went completely off the rails, said parcels would be delivered on certain days (i stayed in all day), turns out it hadn't been loaded on the van. Then another day told me categorically it hadn't been loaded (when I called to check if it had been loaded), and it was actually delivered that day (thankfully just before i left the house).

Like I say I know I'm not the easiest person to deliver to, which is in part why I skipped it. But i certainly don't trust HDN, just have a look at some of the horror stories on review sites.

After Argentina in April 1982 seized and occupied the Falkland Islands, which the United Kingdom claimed as a crown colony, the U.S. executive branch sought to mediate the dispute. When Argentina refused one of the U. S. peace overtures, Secretary of State Alexander Haig announced that the United States would **prohibit arms sales to Argentina** and **provide material support for British operations**. Both Houses of **Congress passed resolutions supporting the U.S. action siding with the United Kingdom**. 14 The crisis ended in June 1982, and in December 1983 the Department of State lifted the ban on arms sales to Argentina.",0,1324470684,null,0,false,0,c39y713,t3_nl1zn,t1_c39y713,t1_c39xsd1,1428054559,6,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,6

I'm British and I support the islanders' right to self-determination. But I also oppose on principle the existence of non-self governing territories.

It still sends a shiver down my spine.  I was 15 when it came out and it was one of those moments in life when I grew up a whole lot in a short space of time.  Almost overnight christmas went from being a happy, fun time when you got presents to being a more sombre time to think about others and reflect on just how lucky we were to have enough to eat and drink.  

It saddens me to think that ~25 years on things haven't changed that much in the world.  But even if we couldn't ""fix"" the world overnight, it did at least raise awareness of poverty, famine and hardship in the World and encouraged people to make a difference, however small.

These days my family all know not to buy me socks, after shave and other tat for christmas.  Instead they buy me charity gifts and some family in Africa get a goat for christmas, a village gets a new water pump, or a school in the middle of nowhere gets some chairs for the kids to sit on.  I get a little card with a picture of a happy kid and a goat on it and it makes me happy.  Happy that I helped someone else who needed it more than me and happy that I don't have to feign pleasure at receiving some trinket that I would have gone to the shop and bought myself if I had really wanted or needed it.  But most of all it reminds me of how lucky I am.

Then a group of citizens from the nascent Argentina asked if they could establish a colony under British sovereignty. We accepted as long as they accepted that Britain owned the place. Then about 5 years later they put up an Argentinian flag. Britain sent a fleet down and removed the leadership of the colony and restored British rule. Invasion aside it has been British territory since.

The Argentinian claim is two fold. At one point Spain claimed it and Argentina claims all territory that Spain once claimed. Secondly on the basis of somebody throwing up an Argentinian flag temporarily. Both claims come under imperial era law. Argentina has no sensible claim under modern international law.

Britain's claim is that the governor had no right to unilaterally change the sovereignty of the islands. He asked for British permission before forming the colony thus recognising outright that indeed Britain had sovereignty. Ironically if he hadn't asked for permission he'd probably have a sensible case that Britain had relinquished sovereignty. That is the claim under the old imperial era international law.

The claim to the Falklands is actually greater.  When it was discovered by European powers it was uninhabited (tho there was some evidence that some Amerindians *may* have visited the island... there is no, to my knowledge, proof positive, tho).  It is unclear who discovered the islands, but the British have a very legitimate claim to first discovery.  Regardless, the French technically colonized the islands first, with the British colonizing it soon after (not aware of the French colony).  The French sold that colony to the Spanish.

The British and Spanish maintained claims to the islands for years.  Eventually the two countries understandably came to loggerheads, and nearly to blows, but the Spanish recognized Britain's partial ownership of the islands via treaty.  This treaty utterly destroys the Argentinian claims that they acquired the islands wholly as a result of independence from Spain - at best they could have acquired shared rights.  

The British expelled the few Argentinian settlers present in 1833 and maintained a continual presence there until the Argentinians were belligerent in 1982.

After reading [LFC's official statement](http://www.liverpoolfc.tv/news/latest-news/liverpool-fc-statement-20-12-11) yesterday, I realised how awful the whole situation is. Forget the claim itself for a second, when it has to go into details about a player's ethnicity and so on, it just makes the whole thing seem crazy. This may sound strange -- and I don't know if anyone else feels the same way, but as a white guy, it's exactly this kind of thing that has me on edge all of the time. Of course I'm not racist but even so, I'm constantly paranoid of coming across as such. So many people don't even understand what racism is (maybe even myself, hell I've never experienced it have I) and as a result, it's the first thing anybody latches onto in almost any context.  
  
Going back to Suarez's case in particular, I don't think the question of 'did he or didn't he' is even relevant any more. The whole way the FA has handled the situation is what's worrying. They don't think Suarez is racist and Evra himself has admitted as much; so I don't even understand how a case can be pursued at all from there. The whole claim is based on the word of one person alone [WHO HAS MADE SIMILAR CLAIMS IN THE PAST], despite the supposed crime taking place ""at least 10 times"" and well within earshot of multiple of persons on the pitch. Furthermore, Evra has admitted making abusive remarks at Suarez -- which Suarez wasn't even aware of. WTF?  
  
All I can make out of this mess is that aside from a potential leap backwards for the fight against racism, I would imagine it makes the Premier League seem a lot less appealing to foreign players; especially when you look at the white-boy-captain-of-the-national-team saga. After the way Luis Suarez's time at Liverpool has been so far, I wouldn't even be surprised if he decided he's had enough next month.

The Chinese government (Qing Dynasty) refused to import opium from British India because, well, because it was ruining their population. Britain wanted Chinese tea in large quantities but the only thing the Chinese wanted from us in return was silver, which was extremely costly. So we began importing opium and essentially addicting a large quantity of the Chinese population, thus they started accepting opium in exchange for tea.

In 1839 the Qing dynasty forbade any further opium imports, leading the First Opium War. The conclusion of this war led to the Treaty of Nanking in which Hong Kong was ceded to the British, along with various other extremely harsh conditions for the Chinese.

The ticket inspector was arrogant and confrontational, where he should have been diplomatic and conciliatory when he announced at the top of his voice that he didn't care about refusing to allow the train to move, because he was being paid either way.

Announcing at the top of his voice was also an attempt to involve the passengers (who, he said, were being held up because of the situation) against the boy, especially when he said more than once that ""they"", would get angry, and, in this, he showed his own impotence.

The old man, then, when the bully-boy rose to his bait, and asked him whether he wanted the boy off the train, said (at least, by my hearing of the video) ""Aye"", thus authorizing the bully-boy's assault when it was actually his job to prevent any assaults on his train; and, later, at the door of the train, the old man participated (at least according to what I saw in the video) in the assault with the bully-boy when the boy tried to get back onto the train for his bag.

I have never once condoned the boy's language, but I also see that it was only after a continued campaign by the guard to embarrass him that he so spoke.

One of the arguments raised could easily have happened, the other not so much.

The fact is, at the moment, our legal system relies on people being decent citizens and doing their duty to jury service when required (which is pretty bloody rare anyway). In order for this to work everyone must play by the rules. If you don't you can get prosecuted and, as shown, the penalties can be harsh. Much like the riot sentences it is designed to show a message - we will not tolerate this.

If the entitled people who think that skipping jury service because it's ""boring"" don't get the message then it's their own fault.

As to ""it'll ruin his life"" etc - There shouldn't be inertia for a fit punishment. If the punishment is fit, as I believe it is in this case, then there should be a ""oh yes but it might..."" argument - fit punishment is fit. Perform it.

Basically Italy stated to prisoners with left than three years left on their sentence they could leave but if they offend again they get their remaining time back plus whatever they do.

Main results

&gt;Inmates with longer suspended sentences — and therefore longer expected sentences for new crimes — were less likely to be re-arrested than those with shorter suspended sentences.

&gt;Even a small increase in the expected sentence - as low as one month - was enough to reduce recidivism slightly, 1.3 percent.

&gt;The deterrent effect was consistent across all age groups and genders of former prison inmates.

Interestingly, and somewhat related...

&gt;There was one significant exception to the deterrent effect, the researchers found. Inmates convicted of more serious original crimes were not affected at all by the threat of longer sentence. In other words, the more dangerous inmates are not deterred by the threat of stiffer penalties.

I would say that applies here. For a minor crime the threat of harsh punishment does work. For more serious crimes a different method of prevention is used.",0,1324486727,null,0,false,0,c39zyw2,t3_nl85w,t1_c39zyw2,t1_c39zwd7,1428055396,5,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,5

The Ministry of Information was formed by the British Government as the department responsible for publicity and propaganda during the Second World War. In late 1939 after the outbreak of the war, the MOI was appointed by the British Government to design a number of morale boosting posters that would be displayed across the British Isles during the testing times that lay ahead.

With a bold coloured background, the posters were required to be similar in style and feature the symbolic crown of King George VI along with a simple yet effective font. The first two posters, ‘Your Courage, Your Cheerfulness, Your Resolution will Bring Us Victory’ and ‘Freedom is in Peril’ were produced by His Majesty’s Stationery Office (HMSO).

These two were posted on public transport, in shop windows, upon notice boards and hoardings across Britain. The third and final poster of the set was again very straightforward and to the point - it simply read ‘Keep Calm and Carry On’. The plan in place for this poster was to issue it only upon the invasion of Britian by Germany. As this never happened, the poster was never officially seen by the public.

It is believed that most of the Keep Calm posters were destroyed and reduced to a pulp at the end of the war in 1945. However, nearly 60 years later, a bookseller from Barter Books stumbled across a copy hidden amongst a pile of dusty old books bought from an auction. A small number also remain in the National Archives and the Imperial War Museum in London.

Sadly no record remains of the unknown Civil Servant who originally came up with the simple and quintessential Britishness of the Keep Calm and Carry On message.

true,Geofferic,essex,"Bloody Barkingside, Wot!","The US and the UK do not need the cheap food.  The US least of all.  That's patently absurd.  The US has such an over-abundance of food that it turns a massive percentage of its crop into inefficient fuel and annually has to buy up large chunks of the poultry market and gift it to third world nations.  Further, other grains are destroyed annually in order to prevent surplus from driving down the costs further.

Further still, Brazil imports more from the US than in exports to the US.  A trade embargo will not do anything to US food supplies that anyone will notice.  It's pure fantasy to believe so.

Britain produces 60% of its own food.  [Brazil is not a top 25 trade partner with the UK.](https://www.uktradeinfo.com/index.cfm?task=topPartners)  The UK imports 3.2 billion pounds worth of meat annually, and that is the 20th largest category.  Other foodstuffs are not even in the top 20.  The *value* of the imports of food is, relatively, quite low.  Sourcing lost food imports from Brazil (hell, all of S America) would not cause a significant rise in food costs in Britain.  [In this discussion government document](https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;q=cache:ys2OPbTdh70J:www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmselect/cmtrdind/208/208i.pdf+uk+brazil+trade&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=uk&amp;pid=bl&amp;srcid=ADGEESjvFS_2wNUgmI65jefAQAHPLZ4C-8WSIELnai1eFDGF5cv2Fx8F6_ewqBFhMak4DDQaVstDk5PP_UHu6foygKzQncUSFn2XUJkjX8htnrB8KaiJAe9vO_Z_6-yGKmNxXPJwjRQb&amp;sig=AHIEtbSWRx5B0_B1logOYG0NFJqPzAr3pg) on trade with Brazil and S America, meat and other food is *not even discussed*.  The percent of beef imported to the UK from Brazil: 3%.  Oh, and it's been steadily declining due to the low quality of the beef (generally), the very poor safety standards and the lack of humane treatment of the animals.  There are quite a lot of rather strident calls to end all imports of Brazilian beef, actually, and they have some traction.

If Brazil supports some sort of Falkland invasion, they will be embargoed and to believe otherwise is absolute naivety.  To believe that the would not be embargoed because of the *financial damage* it would do to the UK or US is completely against the facts and bizarre.

Suppose when the FA releases their facts and findings in their investigation and they only propose hearsay and no ""hard"" evidence. Hard evidence my include, but not limited to, video and recordings of Suarez using the words in a tone/manner that would suggest some sort of racial abuse. IF the FA only relies on hearsay, could Suarez have the ability to sue the FA? There are dozens of damages that could be files against the FA, I would imagine. Even then, would a civil court proceeding have any weight against the FA. Could an injunction be imposed to keep the suspension from happening?

true,OriginalEnough,eng-norfolk,Norfolk,"Methinks that there were other reasons for the lad acting as he did. They still didn't justify his actions, but I think it had something to do with reacting poorly to a clerical error. Apparently, he attempted to buy two single tickets on his journey out, one there and one back, but was given two in the same direction. The original video supports this theory somewhat, with the conductor stating that the ticket was for the other direction. Thus he may have felt cheated/upset. Again, this does not validate his actions, but it may explain them.

For example; I love Alex Kingston and everything that she brings to the show as River Song in the supporting role that she plays, but I don't think I would totally like her as the Doctor.  The same would ring true for Helen Mirren.  I feel like she would play a great companion if the BBC would cast her as that.  I really haven't watched any of her films or tv show roles and I don't have anything against her specifically. 

I am also wonder what sort of dynamics would take place between The Doctor and River if they were to cast a female Doctor in general.  I have some questions floating around like ""Would the Doctor have the same mindset?"" i.e. Would they continue that relationship with River or would things change completely?  I know there are a variety of companions that the Doctor has had throughout the show's history, both male and female, but would we see a change in roles?  Would we see a more predominate change to a male companion since the past few long staying companions have been female.  I guess I just have a lot of questions as to how they would take the series.

Obstinate?

&gt; The only primary source shows the 'victim' seated quite passively, so this is exaggeration if we exclude any hear-say surrounding the incident

I'm referring not just to the video but to the account given by the man who filmed it. I agree the facts aren't in yet which is why I look forward to the result of a cool, calm, evidence-based assessment by the courts. You'll note I didn't deny the possibility that others were in the wrong, I'm just pointing out that it's wrong to portray this person as being an innocent victim of assault as if he had no part to play in the situation escalating (which seemed at the time of my comment to be the prevailing mood of the thread and something worth countering).  

&gt; The attempt to legitimise force and for him to take the minor beating like man

Not what I said, actually. I'm pointing out that he could take his share of responsibility for the situation like a man, that's all. It's perfectly possible for him to admit to faults on his part without legitimising the assault. There's some possibility his behaviour was down to a diabetic hypo - I've seen friends in a similar state get very aggressive, but whilst they might explain their behaviour they wouldn't seek to excuse it or blame others' reactions, certainly not in a situation like this.

&gt; I don't think it wise to cheerlead this kind of reaction. It usually smacks of a lack of imagination to promote violence as a means of conflict resolution. 

I don't think it wise to cheerlead the opposite reaction that people should *never* take a stand as citizens against anti-social behaviour by their peers, or should be automatically condemned for doing so. It usually smacks of an unwillingness to consider the rights and responsibilities of all of the people involved, and an inability to differentiate between the hand on the shoulder and the jackboot in the face. It also smacks of a lack of experience with anti-social behaviour and its effects.

&gt; What was about a few pounds has already escalated into legal proceedings, and more serious injury could have occurred with him having been thrown by the neck backwards off the train

true,plasticmouse,english,Winchester,"I work in a bookies. Ain't no winner but the bookies. We clear hundreds of millions a year as a business on roulette alone (that's before slots). Every time a new game is released, it is skewed more toward the bookie than the customer. For example; Key Bet Roulette is the bookies darling right now. The same as normal roulette except for some very important differences. 

Firstly, there is an extra slot on the wheel - like American roulette. However; instead of being a 00, it says Key Bet on it. This is a way into a multiplier or pot *if* you have at least a pound on the Key Bet slot.

Consider the extra money they are making with this extra £1 each spin already. Then there is the small fact that you are still only paid out at 35/1, despite there now being 38 spaces on the board. Oh, and perhaps most importantly of all - it's a minimum total £5 bet per spin.

The same is true of all of the old favourites. They get 'updated' with new 'features' and turn into bookie gold mines. The margins are shocking.

FOBTs (or Fixed Odds Betting Terminals) are 92% payout at £1; 94% at £2; and a whopping 97% when playing Ultra Spins (7 spins for £20).

That doesn't sound too bad does it? In fact; if the customer wins as much as 97% of the time; how do the bookies make any money? There are a couple of reasons. The first is greed. The vast majority of people; having won a tenner lets say; will just put it back in. Also, these days; most of the machines allow you to gamble each and every win. So you got your 50p at 92% but when you gamble it, it's '100% random'; which means goodbye money, if you keep doing it.

But the most shocking stat is this: What is this mystical percentage based on? 92% of what? It was fairly easy to work out in the old days of physical reels; but now 'reels' are hundreds of symbols long. By multiplying all of these symbols (I *think* you multiply to ^3) you get around about 100,000 spins. Soooo, that means that at 92%, you could spin 8000 times *in a row* and win bugger all.

This is the reality of modern fruit machines. 

There are two tips in betting. The first one is don't bet. The second is that if you win more than your stake - and I mean even 10p - walk away. If everyone did that, we'd go bankrupt before the year was out.

But people never do...

There are different societal expectations and cues expected and read from men and women.  A man doing something that is seen as strong and assertive will be seen as bitchy when a woman does it.  A woman doing something cute and flirty will come off as creepy when a man does it.  Jack would not be able to get his own show as a hypersexualized omnisexual woman unless it was on the playboy channel. The intrinsic ""bumbling professor"" and ""crotchety old man"" archetypes The Doctor is built on (note: these are not the only archetypes the Doctor is built on, but they're there) don't have a female equivalent in our collective conscience. 

We can see Matt Smith and imagine him being an old man in the body of a 20something year old because our brains can look at the cues and mentally ""age"" him.  Gender is a more intrinsic and divisive thing though.  An old woman however would completely change the way we perceived and interpreted her actions and dialogue in a way that I don't think would be beneficial to the show or the character.

There is a canon precedent for Time Lords changing genders. Their idea of gender is probably pretty fluid because of this, and it probably is among most people in a certain time period anyway (""You people and your quaint little categories""). Change is also a fact of the Time Lord species. Each Doctor is different and relationships change. Gender would just be another aspect of this.

Anne Milton said:    
“Violence against women and children is unacceptable...""      

The article then seems to imply ""children"" = ""girls"".

What about boys and men? Surely violence against *people* is unacceptable? Of course, I realise sexual assault is committed against women and (female?) children far more than men, but it's not negligible. Are the numbers so different that there can't be facilities/programs for everyone including men too, or am I missing the point?

I'm reminded, in a way, of the situation with regards mental health/counselling a few years ago. I was told that not many facilities were available for young men, but lots of support offered to young women - that's even though suicide is (much?) higher among young men than women.

I don't wish to see needed funding removed from any group, but perhaps someone can explain to me if they know why it seems there is a disparity between sexes when it comes to things like this.

true,[deleted],null,null,"Interesting questions. Firstly, in regards to who is proposing this and what exactly is being proposed; the vision for the future of forestry in Northern Ireland was set out in 2006 by Agriculture minister Jeff Rooker in a policy entitled “A Strategy for Sustainability and Growth”. In this policy document the minister sets out that the area of forests in NI should double within the next 50 years. That is the aim, but many environmental and renewable energy organizations would like to see greater levels of afforestation. It just doesn't seem too feasible right now for several reasons. 

Afforestation wasn't a top priority on the government's agenda for a long time, mainly because achieving political stability and an end to the violence was a much greater imperative. This is why the ROI is way ahead of us in their afforestation efforts. Forest cover in the Republic is around 13% now and only around 6% in NI. The Republic also has more ambitious afforestation objectives. 

Why do they want to do this? Meeting renewable energy and EU carbon emission reduction targets are both very high on the government's agenda. Increasing forest cover can help with both of these aims. Forests act as a carbon sink and so help off-set Co2 emissions. Energy security is another objective high on the government's  agenda today. Wood harvested from forests, or from short rotation coppice (mostly willow) can also be used as a fuel for heat and energy. This is a very widespread renewable energy in many places in Europe (Austria in particular) but oil is still heavily used in NI. This has the result of making us dependent upon foreign imports for fuel.  With the rising price of oil it is very important for us to achieve a greater level of self-sufficiency in our energy supply. Increased forest cover would help us do this and it would mean that the majority of the profits would be kept *in* the country as opposed to going to foreign oil producers. 

Farmers would agree to afforest areas of their land because they are offered grants for doing so. There is a big issue however with this scheme because the markets for biomass (wood fuel) in NI are still very undeveloped. Who wants to grow biomass if there is no profitable market for it? And so when grants were cut recently the entire biomass infrastructure fell apart as it was dependent upon these government grants. Forests are also viewed by the government as important environmental and recreational amenities. They increase levels of biodiversity and pshycological studies have found that engaging in regular forest-related activities has great psychological benefits. 

**tl;dr**: There are many many benefits to increasing forest cover. The top benefits relate to energy security and Co2 emission reductions.

true,Skulder,null,null,"Language is quite a gray area, especially once we move onto concepts (good, bad, hero, villain), because we can only define these words with other words. 

My point is mostly, though, that the definition for ""irony"" in many dictionaries is especially poor.

This one has five meanings listed, most of them concise and exact, but the fifth meaning:

&gt; an outcome of events contrary to what was, or might have been, expected.

is poor, imprecise, lists no examples, and doesn't differ from ""incongruous"" or ""unexpected"".

Wikipedia comes to the rescue, though

&gt;It is often included in definitions of irony not only that incongruity is present but also that the incongruity must reveal some aspect of human vanity or folly. 

&gt; Thus the majority of American Heritage Dictionary’s usage panel found it unacceptable to use the word ironic to describe mere unfortunate coincidences or surprising disappointments that “suggest no particular lessons about human vanity or folly.”

So something's clearly amiss. However, Merriam-Webster writes:

&gt; incongruity between a situation developed in a drama and the accompanying words or actions that is understood by the audience but not by the characters in the play.

And I think this is the root of the problem, because the above describes three separate things happening simultaneously:

* The confusion that the actors feign, when things happen in unexpected ways.

* The literary device used in storytelling, dramatic irony, where a morale  is highlighted.

* something happening that is opposite to what was expected.

tl;dr most dictionaries are hundred of years old, and have had a good chance to root out most mistakes. Some prevail over language, though.",0,1324528463,null,0,false,0,c3a6e08,t3_nl85w,t1_c3a6e08,t1_c3a1dri,1428058487,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

The Doctor can regenerate 12 times. Assuming the first Doctor was actually born and did not regenerate, there can be 13 individual Doctors.

Matt Smith is the eleventh doctor, so there will be two more actors to replace him. 

Each actor will most likely get 2-4 seasons. 

So, assuming that Matt Smith has one or two more seasons on the show, plus two more actors and their seasons, we could have anywhere from 6-10 more seasons of Doctor Who without breaking the 12 regenerations.

Would forcing a teenager of small stature off at a possible unknown destination at night, in winter, perhaps a multiple hour, or even impossible walk, from home endanger a life?

You don't think we don't notice custom programs?! When you play machines as much as we do you notice the slightest change in the behaviour- a light not flashing, different text - longer delays. We once had a golden game give a top for £11 (which they simply don't do), phone calls were going around every where to avoid the fuck out of that place, or at least tread carefully. Those custom programmes aren't designed to hurt us anyway, they are out to catch the addicts out.  If a private arcade owner thinks someone is ripping % out of their machine they will just ban them.

Your mate probably does catch people, but not proper players. there are lots of people who go around acting like they know machines, but actually they are just well-informed addicts. It's the discipline, routine, sharing (or not) of information and staying out of bookies that makes the difference.

As for ""the winner"", yes the fruit machine/arcade will always make money (Aside from emptiers), but so do professional players. We leave machines in such a state of negative % that the next poor buggers to go on it will inevitably lose.

true,Atomicide,num22,,"1. Redknapp genuinely thinks that Walker could tear up the right side, and sticks him there potentially disrupting a Chelsea gameplan and causing loads of hassle for them.

2. If Walker is unable to play well on the right wing (which in no way diminishes his ability as a player) you play it safe and keep him where he is best.

There is no ""hardcore"" gambling involved so to speak. As a manager he will be aware of a playera ability and what they can do, obviously there is a small risk factor because if Redknapp over-estimates his ability, and Walker plays poorly on the day as well, thay could compound into a serious issue, albeit one that can be resolved by a substitution.

/Start Rant

As for the ""esteemed"" England position I look at it this way. It's an honor to be linked to it, its a punishment to be given it. Redknapp is no good for England, he would pick fresh players and plan ahead, we'd probably end up doing something moronic under him, like getting to a final or something. We would be better of with another manager who would pick Gerard and Terry (again), and hopefully coax Heskey out of retirement for that 2nd round exit everyone craves.

Seriously, I'm an England fan, but fuck the England team. This current team is nothing more than a smear campaign, with whiny, crying players. Say what you want about him, but Beckham stepped up every time for England, and was dropped. If the rest of those ballbags had half the desire and determination he did we would actually win something.

- there is a temptation to believe that the programmers of bandits put their own hidden codes in to make a bit of money on the side. Any truth in this?
- there used to be a code you could press that would reveal certain info (think it was 321 231). I understood it was a function to help the people running a lot of machines see whether or not it needed emptying. Do you use this info to your advantage?
- a few years ago I remember downloading emulators for popular machines.  They were quite impressive and even had skins for the graphics on the machines. Did you ever use these to your advantage?
- I used to have a trick to get 99 nudges and an instant jackpot on Excalibur I think it was. It took a bit of play to get it but was really quite easy to nail on a relatively low outlay. Do you know the trick and what was this an example of? (i remember it not working in a service station which made me think it had become too widespread and got patched).

true,plasticmouse,english,Winchester,"FOBT's are the second coming for bookmakers. They make at least the same amount of money in a day as OTC (over the counter) bets; and in a lot of cases, are the main source of income. It is not in their interest to make these games in any way fair. The thing about gamblers though, is that they know how against them it is, and yet they do it anyway.

I used to make a decent amount of money from fruities; back in the olden days. On the likes of 3 player Monopoly and Golden Game. There were some pretty obvious markers. Within about £10 of play, you had a good idea what mood the machine was in, and whether it was going to pay out. For example, when you got the up top bonus, you generally wanted the lowest prize (£5), because you knew that if that happened, you'd go up at least two or three more times, culminating in the jackpot. Some days, you could rinse one and just move along to the next, until the whole thing was empty.

These days; in the land of £500's, I have personally seen people spend over £2,500 and walk away with nothing. People still seem to believe that they can 'push' the machine by loading it with cash. There is no explaining the reality to these folks. They simply don't want to hear it.

Don't even get me started on people who try to explain to you a guaranteed way of winning on roulette. In fact, bog standard roulette is the only 100% fair bet in a bookies. It genuinely is 100% random, all of the time. People cry fix, and say things like, ""It lands on the only bloody number I don't have covered"", but they do not understand the power of the maths involved.

In European roulette, there are the numbers 1 to 36, and the 0 space. So you have a 1 in 37 chance of your number coming up. That is HUGE! Any gambler with any sense knows that that is a bloody terrible bet. As well as this is the fact that the same number could come up an infinite amount of times. There is nothing to stop it. Equally, there is no reason why the ball should ever land on your favourite number. Ever. 

For European roulette, a single number wins 1⁄37 and loses 36⁄37:
−1×36⁄37 + 35×1/37 = −0.0270 (2.70% house edge). Roulette does *not* have a system! *sigh*

true,[deleted],null,null,"It's funny that this is being downvoted in both versions of the story that have been posted so far to this reddit. Look at it this way...no one seems to want to discuss it, yet the main defence or reason for dismissal is the trusted ""I didn't even know coloured was offensive!"" excuse. Well shit, if your natural inclination is to ignore the conversation every time it came up then no wonder you have no idea what is and what isn't offensive. Too often issues of race are dismissed with the same old tired ""It's leftist liberal PC nonsense"" rebuttal and then the same people feign ignorance later on.

So, lets *talk* about it. First, it's the Daily Mail. Look at where Hansen is ""under fire"" from...fucking Twitter! It's not like some black and ethnic minority pressure group has organised pickets and petitions against the man, it's a couple of people on flipping Twitter. He's no more under fire than a bad performer on X Factor! This is sensationalism at it's most blatant. Next the Mail will go out of it's way to get quotes from prominent black figures as if to lend credence to the charge there's some sort of movement behind this.

The most I did last night while watching MOTD was cringe, on Facebook this morning comments from most of my friends was the same. No one was livid, no one wanted the man fired...some even found it hilarious. But that's not the picture that will be painted by the Mail and the morons who comment on the story there (Jesus, have you read that shit?!)

So, a few things to clear up;

* According to many in the article comments section you're not allowed to say black so they don't know *what* to say any more. Bollocks. If you're the sort of person that mixes up ""black"" and ""black cunt"" then fuck you, I don't even want to waste breath on you. No one is offended with black on it's own, I'm black. Call me a black guy and I'll acknowledge the fact. Call me a black cunt/bastard/shit and don't be surprised when you receive a punch in the mouth.

* Coloured isn't so much offensive as it is hackneyed, old fashioned and insensitive. It implies white is a default and everything else can be lumped together as some aberration, like a pristine white sheet of paper that's been tarnished by a careless crayon image by a child.

* Hansen is no racist as far as I know, but he is in his late 50's. Apparently people have been trying to discourage the term coloured since the 70's, before I was even born, so Hansen has seemingly done a lot of conversation ducking and ignoring in the last 4 decades. It#s a simple case of , you should know better by now. But no real harm has been done, he was actually saying something good.

So, please, stop hiding your heads in the sand. The conversation isn't *that* uncomfortable. Now you know. You are perfectly free to carry on using the term, but never hide behind a wall of ignorance just because it's more convenient than the simple truth that you don't like being told what to do and will be defiant just because.",0,1324551957,null,0,false,0,c3a8p1c,t3_nmgsv,t1_c3a8p1c,t3_nmgsv,1428059644,7,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,7

The Argentineans can talk all they want, but they can't do anything.

Whilst our Armed Forces look different to how they did in 1982 we're still the 4th largest spender on Defence in the world and you still get something for your money.

In 1982 we had our eye off the ball. Equally, the senior military man on the Islands was a major. Now we have a Brigadier in Command. We have a military airfield, fast jets in place, a raft of radar and SIGINT and contingency plans up the ying yang.

We routinely have a nuclear sub in the area and we know what they can do to dago shipping. Whilst we have less ships they are immeasurably more capable; one of those new Frigate things (ships aren't my strong point) could apparently park next to the Falklands and track the entire Argentine airforce and shoot them all down as they left Argy airspace.

16 Bde has now returned to contingency as has 3 Cdo Bde, i.e. they are off the HERRICK treadmill and stood by for other taskings.

Argentina, meanwhile, no longer has an amphibious capability.

So, picture the scene. Int (our eye is now very much on the ball and the Yanks share with us) tells us they may be about to try something. A few more Typhoon fly down there. A BG or two from 16 Bde fly down (via ascension, which we own) to the in place military airfield and stand by to execute a number of conplans. We park a Frigate thingy there and have a few subs nose about.

They start coming. Our ISTAR picks them up. They get a warning. They ignore it. The sub begins sinking their ships. The Frigate thingy shoots down all of their aircraft. If, by some miracle, they get a few troops ashore they are met by an Afghan hardened, well equipped BG who have had time to prepare. Imagine fighting a dago Army who try to fight conventionally.

No UK government would ever not fight for the Falklands; it would be electoral suicide.

 * Some old machines had a code on the reels to freeze the machine, pretty sure it didnt do anything tho. Must've cleared a cache or something

 * Emulators are cool , but they are not useful as they don't play quite the same as %s and the machine doesn't have a history of place to base it's payout % on. Also emulators tend to be about 3/4 years behind a machine, but if you want feature experience for free, they are great fun.

Personally I don't much like sugar free versions of drinks either. If you take the 'natural' fat and sugar out of something you have to replace it in order to have a vaguely similar taste and texture to the original. The replacement is often not that great.

There is evidence that such foods actually increase appetite and lead to weight gains. Pushing people toward 'low fat' and 'sugar free' varieties of foods is not necessarily going to make them healthier. 

The fat people I know have weight issues due to things like a lack of knowledge about nutrition and tactics to avoid over-eating, and general lack of control/perspective plus general bad habits. It's nothing to do with the cost of the food and people are unlikely to change what they eat because it got a little more expensive - they don't *know* anything else. Fruit and veg are incredibly cheap but people still aren't eating them.

These taxes will punish the poor and the vulnerable and barely affect those with a higher level of education (who are usually financially better off).

 I would be far less skeptical if the plans included education and subsidising healthier options such as lean meat, fruit and veg, off the back of these taxes. ",0,1324554902,null,0,false,0,c3a8v27,t3_nm55u,t1_c3a8v27,t3_nm55u,1428059718,6,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,6

&gt;Bearing all this in mind, perhaps it might be better to look at how these drinks are made and look at subsidising better ingredients, or removing subsidies or increasing duty on worse ingredients like refined sugar.

The problem with manipulating the ingredients of a product are that it will affect more than just the product you are aiming to change attitudes towards, it's far easier to just impose a direct extra charge on the specific product. It may still have some sort of knock on effect somehow, but it'll be a hell of a lot less than just upping the price of sugar across the board.

The problem with things that concern public health is that we have a public health system, and preventative care is usually a hell of a lot less cheaper and better in general for the population. Ideally education would be the best preventive care for a lot of problems that are relatively common, however education isn't something that's particularly cool currently. Hopefully attitudes towards learning and education will change overtime and people will become more learned in things regarding their own health (however it's easy to get rubbish information in regards to this, so it's a bit of double sided coin).

my question would be...if you played back then, what is the difference nowadays between the £15 jackpot machines and the £70 ones that are around.

as i said i used to have a theory that if you knew how any machine played (eg. how fast you got on the board, how fast the reels went round etc.) and used to be able to tell on 90% of machines if they were going to pay out after 3 or 4 spins... I was usually right as well, there was something about it where I could just tell that if i put 10 or 15 quid in i was coming out with at least double my money.

So it is. You live, you learn.

&gt; This sounds very much like you are saying it was a just punishment, and by implication that surely means that violence judged to be legitimate.

What you think is implied by what you think it very much sounds like I am saying is not at all the same as what I'm actually saying. I made it very clear that assigning some responsibility for the situation to the student is not necessarily condoning the assault.

&gt; I find the British public in general quite small minded, many readily portion blame and demonise rather than look for insight

Every one of us holding forth on this issue is doing so on the basis of limited information, speculation and opinion. What seems like 'insight' to you might appear to someone else as casting around for excuses; your instinct to look to wider factors could seem like an irrelevant distraction from a central issue of individual conduct. Small-minded, close-minded, it all comes down to the fact that people see things according to their own prejudices and that's equally true for those of us who automatically side with the student as for those who think he got his just desserts. I, for one, am looking forward to seeing what a court makes of this and what the full story is - but for the time being I don't feel at all uncomfortable in having offered an alternative take to yours.

I take your point, but the problem you don't see (and the police clearly do) is that shooting and killing rioters is likely to provoke them into far greater ferocity as well as to bring international condemnation.  Whether the killings can be justified in the cold light of day doesn't really come in to it, tactically and probably strategically, it's almost always going to be an incredibly unwise decision unless someone's life is imminently in danger (which applies to some of the cases you set out).

If you make it so that once you start rioting the police might kill you what's to stop it from being a 'bricks through windows' affair to a full on 'out to kill the police who could kill us' (bit of an over generalisation I admit) when the consequences are the same. I mean, dead's dead right? 


Now this is a massive leap, but if you look at the base level of rioters (though there are some exceptions, see the student riots) the people who do riot aren't exactly the 'cream of the crop', and once a 'mob mentality' takes over it needs to be dealt with carefully not to enrage it and really kick shit off.

Lack of mental health services for men is probably part of the *why* of their higher suicide rate.

While it's obvious that support IS needed for rape victims, why is nothing being done about preventing rape in the first place? 

Rapists are not monsters with no self control and no concept of right and wrong. They are people. People who could actually be taught to *not rape*. Rapists are the ones causing this problem and they are the ones who could choose to stop.

If we have a problem with burglaries in an area we don't 'tackle it' purely by putting money aside for replacing the stolen goods. No, we go after the criminals, teach people to secure their houses and teach people to *not steal*. There is no 'well it happens, here is a new TV'.

If sex education in schools wasn't so piss poor it would actually educate people on issues of consent, the right to autonomy over your body and why no one is *entitled* or *obligated* with regard to sex.

true,andyrocks,cnty-scotland,Kingdom of Clapham,"I mean the military is there to defend Britain and it's territories (as well as other missions, but they are more loosely defined and changable).

Sending a sub to defend a British territory is what the military is for. It costs no more to patrol a nuclear sub off the coast of the Falklands than off the cost of Scotland.

&gt; b) The military exists to put massively expensive pieces of equipment and highly trained personel in a position where they won't do anything, and we'd tell them where one or our subs is, who's key role to to remain hidden.

They won't do anything? I don't think you understand what defence and deterrence is about. Being there, inside a couple of billion pounds of warfighting submarine, is enough. Knowing the sub is around the Falklands is of no use to the Argentinians, they wouldn't be able to find the thing if they wanted to. If it's a Astute sub, even our Navy (with the most advanced ASW tech in the world) would have a very difficult job of finding her.

&gt; c) The military is to be used for cheap ploutical points scoring.

What's ""cheap"" mean here? 30 years ago the Argentinians invaded the islands, and around a thousand soldiers, sailors, marines, airmen, and civilians died. That is very expensive to me.
