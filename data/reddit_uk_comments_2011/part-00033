(referencing the venerable [reference guide site](http://www.drwhoguide.com/who.htm) as a reminder)

__1- The Dalek Invasion of Earth__ (2nd The Ark, 3rd The Web Planet) - I love so much of the Hartnell years.  I _have_ to go with an original TARDIS crew story for my first pic, my second and third are just personal favorites.

__2- Tomb of the Cybermen__ (2nd Seeds of Death, 3rd The War Games)  Again, hard to choose - but I feel more certain of these picks than I do with my First Doctor ones (where my brain keeps telling me to squeeze Keys Of Marinus in)

__3- The Curse of Peladon__ (2nd Day of the Daleks 3rd Inferno) The Third Doctor is my personal favorite - after 3 decades of immersed fandom - I don't think you can go wrong with many of his (okay, some suck), hating you a little for asking me to choose.  Wanting to add The Green Death, Spearhead From Space, The Carnival of Monsters, and the oft maligned Invasion of the Dinosaurs.

__4- The Seeds of Doom__ (2nd The Talons of Weng-Chiang 3rd Robots of Death)  tSoD was my introduction to DW, so I'll let this episode take the controversial place of 4th Doctor first pick.  Very honorable mentions abound.  Ark in Space, Horror of Fang Rock, Deadly Assassin... I'm just going to stop here.

__5- Earthshock__ (2nd Caves of Androzani, 3rd The Visitation) I don't care who gives me crap for it, The Visitation has the 3rd Doctor's TARDIS crew in peak form and, as corny as it can be, it _feels_ 5th Doctorish to me.  Choose Earthshock because it does good things well, and the silent end credits stick with any longtime fan - pretty sure Caves of Androzani is a universal favorite for 5th Doctor fans.

__6- Terror of the Vervoids__ (2nd Vengeance on Varos 3rd The Mark of the Rani)  Don't have a lot to say here.  Colin Baker's era is the UK 80's distilled into a deadly concentrated punch to the brain.  He didn't get enough time.  Thankfully his Doctor thrives in the audios.

__7- The Curse of Fenric (2nd The Happiness Patrol, 3rd Delta and the Bannermen)  or maybe I mean Survival, Remembrance of the Daleks, and The Greatest Show in the Galaxy.  I don't know, it's getting late. I can't explain myself with the 7th Doctor - I like a lot of the stories, but prioritizing them is tough for me for some reason.

__8- '96 TV Movie__ (You are stuck with it - it has its moments, but mostly it hurts to watch.  The 8th shines in the novels - and many good audios.

__9- The Empty Child/The Doctor Dances__

__10- The Impossible Planet/The Satan Pit__ (chosen because I think it is underrated)  Of course people will say Blink, and Blink is great.  I like a _lot_ of the Tenth Doctor. (2nd Midnight, 3rd Planet of the Dead)

__11- The Time Of Angels/Flesh and Stone__ (2nd Amy's Choice, 3rd Eleventh Hour - - disclaimer, I've only seen up through Cold Blood)

IANAL, but I know that this is not true. The castle doctrine allows you to defend yourself against an attacker or burglar. It does not allow you to indiscriminately murder anyone on your property. Normally, in a case where a person kills in self-defense, they are required to demonstrate to the court that they attempted to extricate themselves from the confrontation before using deadly force. The ""castle doctrine"" works on the assumption that it is unreasonable to expect people to meet this requirement in their own home. So, if you kill a burglar in your home, you are not required to show that you tried to flee first, nothing more. Some states (such as Washington where I live) also have ""stand your ground"" laws, which are similar, except not restricted to your home. So, if I am carrying a firearm, and I am confronted by a criminal and reasonably fear for my life, I am allowed to kill him without first attempting to flee.

true,Aethelstan,null,null,"There are several - I'll just give a few of the most important ones:

1. Voting for a particular party has unintended consequences. Who would have thought that voting for Labour in 1974 would ultimately usher in one of the most severe Conservative governments just 5 years later? And how can you predict what would happen after that? *It is not possible to predict the effect of your vote 10, 20 years down the line.*

2. There isn't a single political party that holds views anywhere near mine. For me, there is one issue that should be dealt with immediately as it currently leads to the largest mass impoverishment in history: fractional-reserve banking. It is through this mechanism that the banks create money (the vast majority of money is created in this way, by private banks), making interest on that created money. Plain and simple this is stealing from everyone else by inflation. Not only that, but it is inherently a ponzi scheme because there is more money owed than created (principal is created, principal + interest is owed). It is completely immoral but is blindly accepted by the majority of the population, such is the hold of the banks over the economic and social aspects of society. The fact that this is completely accepted by the current political establishment leads me to the conclusion that the only way forward is to boycott the system (even spoiling the ballot is participation in, and therefore acceptance of, the current politicial system). I don't care about any of the other issues (compared to this one), as they come and go every decade or so (see reason 1).

3. It's dangerous: because the chance that one vote out of the 20 million cast will affect the outcome is much lower than the probability of being accidentally killed en route to the polling station.

But we don't have to look very far back in our own cultural history to see an example of us losing the plot as a nation. I'm talking about the death of Diana, the late Princess of Wales. 

  It was in the news last summer because of the Princess Diana Memorial Fountain, which you'll remember was a rubbish fountain. It fulfilled very few of the job description criteria of fountains. But it's ongoing, it never goes away. I remember when she died. About two days before the state funeral, I went down to Kensington Palace where Princess Diana had lived to look at all the tributes left outside. And in amongst all the bunches of flowers and sympathy cards and poems little kids had written, and drawings and paintings people had done, whatever ... in amongst all that, and this is true, I honestly saw a life-size inflatable model of E.T. It was there outside Kensington Palace two days before the funeral. And I stood there looking at the inflatable E.T for some 40 or 50 minutes. And I thought to myself, how did that get there? Who would have thought that that was an appropriate gesture? 

  I imagined a household somewhere on that awful autumn Sunday morning where perhaps the wife had woken up first and she had watched the news and she went through to her still-sleeping husband, and said: ""Please, please wake up. I need you to wake up and be with me now. There's been some terrible news. I need you to get up, come in the front room and watch it on the television with me 'cause I can't be alone, so please wake up."" But you know, he's asleep. He's going, ""What? It's fucking ... it's half past 6 on a Sunday morning. I am asleep. I know I'm speaking but I am asleep. I don't want to get up. I'm asleep. So just ... I know you're upset, but just say what it is. What is it?"" And she had have gone, ""Please, if you ... if you love me, just this one time, just get up. It's an awful thing and I can't be alone. I need someone to comfort me and share. Just ... please. Get up."" And he'd have gone, ""Look, I was out late last night. I've got work at 7 tomorrow. This is my ... This is my one day for sleeping in. I don't want to get up till about half past 11, to be honest. Even then I'm not gonna get dressed, I'm just gonna be in my pants and stuff, just sitting around. I kind of ...

- Mme Kovarian and The Army of God. How long have they been following The Doctor and his tagalongs? They (more or less) left the universe and they still weren't far enough away to beat their tech.
- The aliens. Whether or not they are the prophesied Silence from series 5 is irrelevant. As it stands, their main goal is to look after the regenerating girl. As she has escaped/been released from their custody, it stands to reason that either a) the aliens are no longer required or b) they're going to go look for her.

- Team TARDIS, obviously. Of course, there are bits missing here, most importantly: When was Amy swapped? Next, what happened between River, Rory and the aliens in the homebuilt TARDIS? Only thirdly does the missing three months come into it.
- Mme Kovarian and The Army of God. How long have they been following The Doctor and his tagalongs? They (more or less) left the universe and they still weren't far enough away to beat their tech.
- The aliens. Whether or not they are the prophesied Silence from series 5 is irrelevant. As it stands, their main goal is to look after the regenerating girl. As she has escaped/been released from their custody, it stands to reason that either a) the aliens are no longer required or b) they're going to go look for her. 

Keeping that in mind, Team TARDIS *may* have been under the aliens suggestion in order to .... &lt;insert shit here.&gt;  
Personally, I think it's more likely to be just the ""holy crap, we forgot *again.*"" thing and they actually spent three months chasing ghosts.

All that considered, I don't think there are three teams at work here. I think two of the teams (TARDIS and fine suit wearing aliens) are effectively working together. If the regenerating girl is River/Melody, then this makes sense. But because at this point, the aliens have the girl, then there's no reason to actively help TARDIS.

In 2010, RBS made a loss of £1.3bn http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-12563720 yet a total bonus pot of £950m was paid.  

""TEN top bosses at bailed out Royal Bank of Scotland will share bonuses of up to £28 million for last year.

So yeah - nearly 10% of that bonus goes on 17 people - those responsible for bad decisions.

The Lloyds numbers looked to be raising £17bn in the first article; it doesn't seem that Lloyds have been as transparent with their bonus figures , since I can only find a comment by a person on a Scotsman article suggesting it's £0.95bn (http://thescotsman.scotsman.com/scotland/Another-15000-to-face-axe.6783997.jp)

There may have been further rounds of bailouts; I only kept figures on the first lot (since I was employed by Lloyds at the time, until I decided to jump ship - and no, they managed to avoid paying me a VR sum by creatively crap-loading my job!).  

Would like any comments from Lloyds staff on what the 2011 bonus figure actually was, and if they have a breakdown available like the RBS one.

Kuyt, Torres, Gerrard, and Reina also signed increased contracts since 09. Torres and Gerrard were both on around 110k/wk with additional advertising and naming rights.

Believe Aquilani is 70 or 80k

Mascherano and Alonso were paid very little, like 35k/wk and 50k/wk. This is because they both left shortly after becoming huge stars.

The issue is not just affecting Liverpool, but inflation of player wages at the highest level in general. Look at the prices players are fetching, it won't be too long till Ronaldo isn't even in the top ten anymore.

I guess if in doubt, you can call a city a town. Most of us think of provincial cities as towns, maybe a few - London, Glasgow, Edinburgh, Manchester, Birmingham - as cities, even though technically anywhere with a cathedral is a ""city"". I went to college in a ""city"" which couldn't have looked less like a city if there were sheep wandering up the high street (which, occasionally, was known to happen).

You can use ""town centre"", ""outskirts"", ""suburbs"", local slang, or just the name of the bit of town you mean. I wouldn't refer to anyone's town as a village though.

I'm having a harder time taking their ""analysis"" seriously with this kind of flawed facts, but I do agree of course that Josh's potential is there, and would love to see him get more chances under AVB. This goes for Sturridge as well, who arguably proved himself in the PL at his Bolton spell. I do however disagree that the capture of Torres makes this hard, and I would rather see us offload the likes of Anelka and Kalou, and give Drogba a less important role in the coming season to make way for Sturridge.

As others have said.... the angels are ""creatures of the abstract"" and feed off ""potential energy"".  In Blink, they are feeding off the remainder of someone's life that could have been.  In season 5, they are feeding off the potential energy from the radiation.  No need to feed one human at a time when the Byzantium is just pouring out tons of radiation.

Also, there were tons of scenes in Flesh and Stone where the angels were in line of sight of each other yet weren't confined to stone.  Heck, the idea of having an army of angels seems pretty risky for the angels in this regard.  

And the idea of being ""quantum"" locked kinda got thrown out the window in Flesh and Stone when Amy had to ""walk like she could see"".  On the one hand, the sonar functionality the doctor added to the walkie talkie could be considered a means of observing the angel.  On the other hand, once Amy starts doubting herself, the angels sense this and start coming to life.  One could almost draw the conclusion that angels turn to stone if they *believe* they are being observed rather than actually being observed.  Going further down that rabbit hole, a delusional angel could theoretically never be turned to stone.",0,1308959219,null,0,false,0,c21qnki,t3_i852c,t1_c21qnki,t3_i852c,1427282167,7,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,7

Question

Why, actually, all this pining over Rose if it would have been enough to get rid of the swimming pool, as it were, to see her again?**

Answer, by NG
&gt;It wasn't easy getting in or --especially -- out of the bubble-universe. They burned up TARDIS rooms for thrust to get in and get out. But they made it.

&gt;However, there's a huge difference between a tiny bubble-universe stuck to this one, and an entire-alternate-universe-new-reality. One's still attached to this universe, with a rift-crack between them, the other's an entirely different order of created things.

&gt;It's actually nothing like that, of course, but I hope it makes things easier for you.


and a follow up: 
&gt;**Where did Idris come from, and why was she in a Victorian party dress?**

&gt;She came through the Rift. And she'd been at a Victorian party.

I would say yes. You can quite easily shout to somebody on the other side of a closed steel door. Airtight steel doors are another matter, but we don't quite know the nature of the transport she was in (I assume low atmo dropship, which might not be totally airtight.)

Put it this way, if you are sitting in a plane (which is airtight) you can still hear sounds from outside, if they are loud enough. I see this as a similar situation.

true,namesaremptynoise,mccoy,McCoy,"~~First of all, the Doctor turning down Amy is pretty much like a 50 year old turning down a 14 year old after she's just had her first couple wine coolers.  She might be physically attractive after a certain fashion, but there are a lot of other things involved here like massive age differences and not taking advantage of the vulnerable.~~

In terms of how 'hard' the sci fi is...  It tends to vary.  Most of the time they try, but little things like that will always creep through(especially back in the classic series, sometimes the writers went full on treknobabble and didn't seem to understand half the terms they were tossing out there).  Keep in mind this is an adventure show first, a family show second, a horror show third, and the actual 'sci fi' aspect of it comes pretty low on the list.  Yes, they travel through space and time, but the show isn't *about* the TARDIS or the screwdriver or the Time Lords, it's about the regular people they meet(whether those people are human or not doesn't matter) and help or foil along the way.

When mp's first came into being they were given their jobs on the basis of representing the people, this was because it was known that the people could never have the time to vote. In today's world where 24 voting banks can be open, caculating votes and producing results within 24 hours, there is no need to have mp's. 

If we get rid of mp's, it means,

1. We will have 100% democracy, where by it is known that the laws that are in place, are so by the majority of the population.]

2. We would save millions on not having to employ mp's. paying mp's thousands of pounds per year is becoming a waste, they are voting on issues we can vote for, and if we need local issues sorted, we need to switch this funding into our councils. 

3. The same point, but different issue, is that we could save millions on mp's expenses, this could again be put towards councils to improve local issues, or towards referedums to decide on the many issues our country faces.

Of course, we would still elect a government, and there would be an opposition government to argue cases and ministers to supervise how money ect is spent/run, but it would be done on proportional representation, this would ensure that we had a clear government, with a clear understanding of who was to blame, clearing up bribery and corruption in government.

Rumors flew pretty heavily that he'd been deliberately frozen out by his teammates, who didn't like his attitude when he came back from the World Cup angling for club glory to complement his World Cup success.  The Atletico manager all but admitted in a press conference that they call him ""la rubia,"" the feminine form of ""Blondie"", behind his back.  He has not gotten especially good service and has fallen drastically out of favor.

To be honest, the lukewarm response to this rumor is surprising me a little bit.  This guy was one of the standout players - in fact, voted *the* standout player - of the World Cup *one year ago.*  He got the Golden Ball, he was joint top scorer, and everyone agreed Uruguay reached the semifinal on his back.  The club season that preceded that tournament saw him net 28 goals in all competitions, and the season before that he won the goddamned Pichichi.  He's still one of the only players to do so twice.

What has everyone convinced that Diego Forlan, 32, is a completely different player from the 31-year-old Diego Forlan that was just lighting up the world stage?  He hasn't suffered some kind of permanent injury, he's had a run of bad form that by all reports is exacerbated - or even created - by his bad club situation.

1) I'm not familiar with Oxenholme train station, but a brief look on google maps gives me the impression 10 minutes should be plenty of time for that change.  The only problem with this is if the first train is late, but it might be best to look at the T&amp;C's beforehand in case this happens.  But it doesn't look too strenuous a line to manage anyway

2) The ticket machines only spit out the tickets for that specific journey I believe (ie from Manchester to Windermere) Once you get to Windermere you can go to the self service machine and get the tickets for your next journey even if youre not due to set off for a day or so.  Do you know the timeframe they give you to collect the tickets? (The only thing I cant stress enough is to remember the debit/credit card you booked the tickets with)

3) I wouldn't worry about it, it's never been enforced on trains that i've seen.  If the train is literally full up it might be enforced, but it shouldn't be on these journeys

4) An extra bit of advice, if you go to Camden Market get the Mexican food it was great when I was there... then again youre probably used to better Mexican food in the USA (presuming thats where youre from)

But since he didn't, I think it would be far fetched to say this isn't a TSZ reference, but that does not mean I'm quarreling with your Zoroastrian point. I should have covered my proverbial Zoroaster in my initial post about TSZ. :D 

Many, perhaps the majority, of modern Zoroastrian references are shaped by TSZ in the same way that Genesis references are tinted by Milton because Paradise Lost is widely-read and central to the modern vision of the creation myth. The original Avestas themselves don't have the same pervasive cultural presence because they aren't widely read in schools and universities.

keep you struggling to put the food on your plate.

not just British Leyland but the whole world 
who would earn their profits? 
who would make their bombs? 
you'd see the hands of oppression fumble 
and their systems crash to the ground 
and you men in uniform will have to learn the lesson too 
not to turn against your own kind 
whenever governments tell you to.

their lazy days are over

That said - and although I can't cite it right now but will when I'm not posting from a phone  - I recall an article or two about the new series addressing earlier criticisms that the old show was chauvanistic, which is supposedly why the new series' companions have been strong-willed women.

It was this quote from King Kenny that made me feel a bit more comfortable about Henderson's future at the club:

&gt;“Jordan is very mature for his age.
&gt;
&gt;“He is respectful and his principles and everything else on and off the pitch are exemplary.
&gt;
&gt;“Not only is he a talented footballer, he’s a really good person as well. He loves his football and he is very appreciative of what Sunderland have done for him.”

So long as these new players can keep focused on their football and keep the distractions and noise of the media hooplah surrounding them, they should be able to fulfill, or even exceed, the high expectations they will have built up around them.

true,BraveSirRobin,null,null,"Britain has spent the last five years [felating Gaddafi](http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2009/oct/26/gadaffi-libya-good-relations-uk). Just look at [that smile](http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/41767365/ns/world_news-mideast_n_africa/t/west-may-rue-embracing-gadhafi/). We [released convicted terrorists to secure oil deals](http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2009/sep/05/straw-admits-oil-role-megrahi-talks). Until six months ago Gaddafi was all [set to be entering the western trade world after years of sanctions](http://www.sourcewatch.org/index.php?title=Libyan_oil_industry). Then Egypt happened and we lost one of our [most reliable dictators](http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/feb/02/tony-blair-mubarak-courageous-force-for-good-egypt) in the region. They worried that Libya would follow, so the [SAS were sent in](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/africaandindianocean/libya/8365069/Libya-SAS-mission-that-began-and-ended-in-error.html) to establish contact with the rebels to ensure that they saw things our way. Their international support [hinges on oil deals](http://uk.reuters.com/article/2011/06/04/uk-energy-libya-deals-idUKTRE75154P20110604). 

Unfortunately things did not go to plan. Gaddafi remains in power and we've backed the wrong horse. So were are quite literally bombing the crap out of them on a daily basis. Any premise that we are ""protecting civilians"" was blown right out the water when we [took out their navy](http://articles.nydailynews.com/2011-05-21/news/29583899_1_nato-forces-nato-warplanes-ports). The UN mandate was to use force [only to protect civilians](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Security_Council_Resolution_1973#Key_points), what we are doing now is committing war crimes, bombing a sovereign nation to promote our own desires. We are now directly fighting on the losing side of an extremely bloody civil war. Besides us extending a conflict that will not be won and being partly culpable for all of the civilians that have died as a result of it (in addition being directly culpable to those our bombs have killed), the war in it's present form is completely illegal under international law.  We are also setting a legal precedent that it's OK for a foreign power to directly attack the UK Prime Minister if they do not like their oil policies.


If the above links &amp; context are not sufficient to prove that this has absolutely nothing to do with human rights or anything other than self-interest for oil access, then consider our staunch allies [Bahrain](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bahrain_%E2%80%93_United_Kingdom_relations). Right now there are daily protests being [brutally suppressed](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hNrxQorrZtE) by a government we fully support. They are being assisted by [another of our even closer allies](http://ukinsaudiarabia.fco.gov.uk/en/), Saudi Arabia, who have [sent tanks](http://www.businessinsider.com/saudi-troops-bahrain-2011-3) to take on the protesters. Note that these are *peaceful protesters*, nothing like armed rebels in Libya. Saudi Arabia itself was [among the first to use violence to prevent protest](http://english.aljazeera.net/news/middleeast/2011/03/2011310185818570316.html).

If we ""succeed"" in Libya the best we can hope for is killing Gaddafi, plunging the country into civil war. The BBC propaganda is preparing the UK public for this outcome, starting the process of manufacturing consent for [deeper involvement in this conflict](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-13692885). 

As will all UK wars, it is based on lies. We do not want ""freedom"" in Libya, we want a new dictator that does not [piss off the IMF](http://www.globalresearch.ca/index.php?context=va&amp;aid=25317) like Gaddafi did. Like Iraq, [the media is not printing the context behind the war](http://medialens.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=632%3Athree-little-words-wikileaks-libya-oil&amp;catid=24%3Aalerts-2011&amp;Itemid=68).

It also coincided with the One World festival in the Guildhall to celebrate cultural and ethnic diversity, and I believe it also coincided with another festival at St. Columb's Park, so the city is absolutely buzzing today. 

Great weather too, for once. 

As for this news report though, it's over-simplifying things to the extreme. It's as if this report was produced with the intention of it being broadcast to people outside Northern Ireland. There is no issue of Catholics or Protestants fearing going over to the other side. It would only be an issue if you were wearing a particular football jersey or holding a particular flag in the wrong neighbourhood. That's still a problem and there is still the odd sectarian attack (I'd say at most a few of them happen every year as of recent years). 

It's not really a case of Catholic on one side and Protestant on the other. It's true that there are small numbers of Protestants living in the city side but Catholics *and* Protestants live in the waterside. Unfortunately though like most places in Northern Ireland both groups of people still live in separate communities (and also unfortunately most school kids go to separate schools) but I've never got a sense of any tensions in the workplace or anywhere else in the city between Catholics and Protestants. Sectarianism isn't the big issue in the city any longer, but certainly the divisions between the communities are still there though - and nothing is being done about that as school kids are still being taught separate to the 'other side'.

Mata is a player that would belong on that world beating XI. If Downing is going to bench warm behind Mata, why don't we just allow Kuyt, Maxi, or Henderson to fill in that Winger spot when Mata needs a rest. £20m seems a lot to pay for a 26 year old bench warmer. I additionally don't see him as being the kind of player content to sit on the bench 6/10 games.

I really think Mata has the drive, ability, and potential to be a Liverpool Legend, whereas I see Downing as a mid-career mid-table player.

EDIT: This all being said I think if we can't get Mata, Johnson would be a really good substitute. The inconsistency mentioned in the article, to me, is due to his tenuous position in City's starting XI. I'm pretty sure if he was at Liverpool he'd be a permanent fixture on the field.

Standard mailings like this are required to be dealt with, all constituency mail is. However, the sheer volume of generic postcards, emails and the like we got from people who had simply filled their name and postcode on a form and sent them in is mind boggling. Your MP will never see it, it will be dealt with with a standard reply and simply create lots of extra paperwork for a researcher or intern. This may seem uncaring but the caseload for any MP's staff is huge even before we deal with this stuff. Because of rules put in place to stop MPs neglecting their constituents we have to treat any official contact as a new piece of casework. That will usually involve opening an individual case file for the constituent in question, filling their details into a standard reply, making copies of all correspondance for various official records, and other paperwork. With controversial pieces of legislation we can recieve several thousand of these mailings and they can take days if not weeks to clear, time we can't then spend dealing with peoples' actual cases or keeping our MP informed. 

Either way, the MP will never see or hear of these types of mailings, unless the number we recieve is truly mind blowing.

true,[deleted],null,null,"Downing is a capped for england, was player of the year at AV, most crosses of any players in PL. Why would he be bench warmer? 

We are getting 2 wingers, so think of a team of at least 2 wingers for every game, why would kuyt or maxi be able to take 1st place over him? Kuyt isn't exactly great crosser of the ball, and even though downing lacks pace himself, he is more of a crosser than dribbler. Maxi is and will remain backup due to his age, and Henderson is hardly close to the experienced player Downing is.

Downing and mata are not competing for the same position, so getting downing does not mean losing out on mata (that is up to the player I reckon due to his ""low"" release clause).

A creative winger and a crossing winger with both being able to play inverted, is the best we could ask for. There has to be risks and those have to be minimal, we are talking about possible 5 new starters joining, stability is needed and so experience(PL) is very important for a team in transitional state. 

I think you can forget about the Barca level for couple of years, not only aren't we able to compete for the best (few players rely on other senses but the money, but they are few), we have to change so many players and see who fits and is able to play the managers game.

There is no reason rehabilitation cannot be carried out in a 'prison-like' environment, that doesn't have the drawbacks of prison eg. hanging around with other more experienced criminals and lured into further criminal acts on release or the inability to re-enter society due to stigma attached to convicted criminals (getting a job after time in prison is incredible difficult, especially getting a good job that can provide for a family) and the only option available will often be further criminal activities... and the cycle begins again.


There's usually a very simple reason why a crime has been committed  and nobody seems to be asking 'why?'. Instead we just get constant knee-jerk reactions and harsh judgements.. 'Lock him up!

true,threecasks,null,null,"&gt; life should mean life. In which case, that point is there in rehabilitation? Since there is no chance of the person being released into the public, why bother?

In my humble opinion, I think we shouldn't give up on anyone in society (or pay to let them waste away) regardless of what they have done. Like I said in another comment, people like this shouldn't be released, but we should try to understand what drives people to commit these crimes.. same with any other individuals in a similar situation (Ian Huntley, Fred West etc.). I imagine a psychologist will probably make some significant discoveries if they are given free-reign to analyse these people for 20-40 years that may help us to remould our society to make sure these things don't happen again. If they don't find out anything, have we lost any more than locking them up in prison?

Locking up Levi Bellfield only stops Levi Bellfield from killing people outside prison, nothing more. What have we achieved apart from this unremarkable and (from looking at other comments) unsatisfactory act?

Did he have cruel parents, did he have money problems, did he have drug problems, psychological issues (what where they?).

There are plenty of unanswered questions that won't get answered while he's in a regular prison cell (and no, I don't mean he should be in some cushy hospital ward.. there are other alternatives to make sure someone is punished and rehabilitated... *and* just because they are rehabilitated or the root of their evil has been discovered, doesn't mean we should release them either!)


But looking at things realistically, I think politicians are too lazy, too greedy and too cowardly to enter into this kind of debate, so any reform or this kind is very unlikely. It imagine it would be incredibly beneficially in the long run but a logistical/political nightmare in the short term.


EDIT: I thought I should also address your point about the inefficiencies of the system in California. I don't see why you shouldn't investigate every last detail of a case to be 100% sure somebody has committed a particular crime. That may take a very long time, perhaps more that 25 years and the cost will always be very high no matter where you are. I wouldn't want a shred of doubt that a person had committed the crime they were accused of if they are going to pay the ultimate price. I would never have the attitude of 'get on with it', as you put it, if a life is at stake.

As someone who has formally studied ancient history, I would beg to differ. Even in ancient democracy, people would enter their local forum and vote in officials to figure out these petty issues. But it wasn't the false democracy we have now (ie. 2 parties with the same point of view), rather, anyone with some respect could enter the forum and ask to be voted in based on their policies.  

The recent referendum, I will agree, was a joke. AV is not a good alternative, give me proportional representation and then you'll have my attention (it's a disgrace this wasn't an option).

true,whatatwit,null,null,"&gt;David Cameron's Big Society? Well, actually, economist E. F. Schumacher thought of it first, forty years ago, and his daughters have recently been invited to No 10 to discuss their father's ideas. This summer marks the birth centenary of Fritz Schumacher, seminal author of the newly re-published ""Small is Beautiful - Economics as if people mattered"". And a long-lost recording of one of his public lectures given at the Findhorn spiritual community in Scotland in October 1976, has just been lovingly restored.

&gt;The recording, now broadcast for the first time, is a revelation. Quite simply, just months before his sudden death, Fritz is on fire! He is relaxed, inspirational, extraordinarily witty, and highly prescient. ""The economic party is over,"" he says, ""we're just left with the washing up. At the height of our achievements, we're bankrupt. Our civilisation is experiencing the second fall of man and must get up again.""

&gt;Jonathon Porritt examines how the philosophy of this German exile, described as ""one of the few original thinkers of the 20th Century"", is now being taken seriously in British government circles, even to the extent of unwittingly helping today's Prime Minister shape his ideas for Big Society. It also reveals how Cameron's predecessor, Margaret Thatcher, was a Schumacher fan - but only up to a point - and how Schumacher championed the now fashionable concepts of well-being measurement, localism, and volunteerism

It's the first time I've ever been on benefits, I find it incredibly humiliating. The Job Centre is a fucking joke, they are absolutely useless at actually helping you find work, and all you have to do to keep getting benefits is three 'actions' a week, so looking in the paper for jobs could be one, calling up for more information another, and sending a CV the third. 

It's really no surprise at all to me that people can stay on benefits indefinitely, it's almost as if the place is set up specifically for that purpose.

I've literally been applying for every single job near me that I meet the requirements for, and haven't even had an interview yet.

The majority of them are fairly basic jobs and I'm worried I look over qualified for them, I think people are looking at my CV and thinking I'd only be there a short time until something better came along. They're right of course, but you know what? In that time there I'd be the best damn employee they have.

That turned into a bit of a rant, but fuck me I'm frustrated at the minute. I had a good job that was supposed to be my first step on a career, it was very long hours, very stressful, and I worked my arse off for two and a half years for poor pay, because I thought it had a future.

I then pointed the MCE patch to the satellites.xml file in the c:\users\public\wintv folder, restarted my machine and ran a single transponder scan and this time channels started showing up.  I had to perform an additional scan on top of the two mentioned in the article to get ITV HD:

true,hennell,cnty-uk,Bristol,"&gt;It's the first time I've ever been on benefits, I find it incredibly humiliating. 


Speaking as someone who's been 'on and off' job seekers for the last year or two (since I graduated - *sigh*) I found it helps to stop thinking of it as 'benefits' and think of it A) as 'Job seekers' B) as your 'job'.  Helped my mental attitude to it anyway, and it seems easier to deal with their frustrating rules when you think of it as 'this my work and what I'm paid to do'. The only one that really got me when they got me to come back at 4pm (5 hours later) and gave me an 'official warning' because I was 5 minutes late for my appointment (Time I'd largely spent there, queuing to hand in my book).  The last three weeks I'd been on time or early but had waited for 1~1.5 hours before I was seen. I was not happy.

That said, you can get lucky with some good advice/help. Some people I had were very 'You should be applying for every job you see' and got me traipsing off to far away supermarkets where experience in retail (I have none) was what they were looking for, and where (IMO) 'Degree' was more likely to be a negative then a selling point. Others however were very helpful, gave good advice and saw their role as helping me with the 'general jobs' whilst I tried to find 'relevant' work'; or even had printed relevant jobs out when they'd seen some on the system, to give me when I came in.

Obviously I don't know your situation; but the people I saw at the job center who were obviously trying to find work (and had decent experience/qualifications or something) didn't tend to be there too long. 

I'm sure you're getting tons of 'advice' from all quarters (often from people who haven't been unemployed, are in totally different work areas or were unemployed but 20+ years ago...); but as you sound like you're in the same situation I was a few months back (Lots of applications very few interviews) so I shall say what helped me: re-write your covering letter(s).  Apologies if you've done this; but after I'd read 2~3 books/websites on 'better covering letters' and written out my next job applications with the key points I'd found in mind, I started getting much better responses, including a few actual interviews (Which lead to me finally getting a job 4 weeks ago).  Obviously it's no magic solution; it is a tough market out there and the numbers of people applying for things is very off putting; but if your CV is as good as you can make it, the covering letter is the only other thing they see to decide if you get an interview, so may as well make it effective.

Good luck. Hope you find a better job then 'job seekers' soon!

I don't see the greatness in Carra anymore, he's probably got the biggest heart in the club but that just isn't enough. Agger is another problem since he's injured al the time so a new CB wouldn't be to shabby. Hazard seems to be a perfect choice for a speedy RW, Kuyt could play against more difficult teams when we need a more two-way type of winger. Mata or Downing on the left flanc, we can't afford both but one of them would be nice.

He lays there for a moment, listening, wondering, but all seems quiet again, and he closes his eyes, awaiting sleep. Suddenly, the door bursts open, and in walks..

""Of course, you won't remember that yet. Not for another.. wait for it.. 38 years. And I wasn't me back then. Well.. I *was* me, obviously, I just wasn't.."" the figure waves his arms vaguely ""**me**. Yet.""

Blinking in the pale light, Adolf can do no more than stand and stare at this strange man gesticulating in the middle of his room in a faded tweed jacket and bow tie, this one man, dumbfounding, frightening, yet strangely arousing.

""The point *is*, you will meet me, back then, because *I* met *you*, and that's the way it works."" The stranger suddenly stops his erratic movements, and stares Adolf in the eyes. ""And now I'm back, and I need your help.""

""No, Adolf. You are not a painter. You are so, *so* much more, and I am so very, *very* sorry. You are the man who saved the Universe. Or you will be. You see, something *very* big and *very* bad is going to happen in the nineteen-forties, and I can't stop it. Not by myself.""

&gt;Rear Adm. Russell Harding, deputy commander of the NATO operation, said the Khadafy regime was employing more ships in its campaign against rebel fighters.

&gt;""Given the escalating use of naval assets, NATO had no choice but to take decisive action to protect the civilian population of Libya and NATO forces at sea,"" he said.

So we have 2 officers for NATO telling us that they needed to act to protect civilians. You posted this article, I suggest you read what you post.",0,1309107309,null,0,false,0,c21zxwh,t3_i8v37,t1_c21zxwh,t1_c21zqi5,1427286614,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/africaandindianocean/libya/8471337/Libya-western-leaders-call-for-Nato-to-target-Gaddafi.html

Google ""NATO assassinate Gaddafi"" for thousands of more stories and confirmation from various sources. 

&gt; So please, if you are saying that we are in fact, attempting to kill Gaddafi, please prove it with either facts.

We are bombing his **homes**. Did you miss the strike where we [took out several generations of his family](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1382341/Libya-Nato-strikes-kill-Gaddafis-son-grandchildren.html)? Oh yeah, that's a warcrime.

Why do you assume that we are the good guys? Because you were born here? Because the movies tell you so?

&gt; So we have 2 officers for NATO telling us that they needed to act to protect civilians

The UN mandate calls for defending civilians against direct violence. Besides the fact there isn't a shred of proof that these ""warships"" were blocking aid, there is no legal mandate to destroy them in port. Now, if they were attacked while they themselves were attacking international shipping then you'd maybe have a case.

What's your angle here? Why do you assume that we are in the right? Are you familiar with the history of the region, particularly the last five years? Did you even click any  of the links in the first post? We are taking out Gaddafi for our own resource-fulfilment reasons, not to ""save the world"".

2. That was odd, I admit. I can't square that monologue with the rest of River's gun-happy moments.

But, I'm not satisfied that a non-pacifist would make a good pacifier. I'm uncomfortable with the suggestion that a major character's psyche isn't cohesive-- that is, she's programmed in some way to act oddly at some points. I'd like a picture of River where she feels comfortable using a gun, and yet she'd like the Doctor to stop being so warlike. It would almost cheapen her character to have her doing big things in a fugue state.

Further, I'm not sure the message the writers would want to send is ""all that killing and warring the Doctor's doing is great stuff, you should watch out for pacifists."" You know? Whereas the message that the Doctor should look at himself and how he acts, and re-evaluate his actions, strikes a stronger chord. The Doctor has been running away from his warlike side for a long time, and while he's gotten less rage-y, he's still doing enough damage to cause the clerics to exist. It would seem odd after all these arcs about pacifism, for the message to be ""pacifism makes things easy for theocracies.""

true,darknecross,null,null,"The only thing I'm not sure of about this is the lack of connection to the earlier episodes. We'll take it that the space suit was River Song as a child.

I think that maybe it's River Song that kills the Doctor in the first episode. It's obviously someone the Doctor recognizes, as he says as much. (""Hello. It's okay, I know it's you."") It helps that River knows the Doctor better than anybody, and being part timelord, knowing how to kill him makes sense. It also falls into line with the other quotes you presented about her killing a good man.

So how does she fit into it? Why were The Silence guarding her in 1969? What happened to her after? Watching over bits of episode 2 again, I'm trying to figure out Amy Pond's disappearance. I'm guessing they melt down her Fleshy self and reconstitute her down in their basement. Remember when they were questioning how her recorder could be taken out of her; I'm guessing it just fell out when she was melted. So then who are we hearing? The recorder was telepathically connected to Flesh Amy, who was connected to Real Amy. With the Flesh copy gone, it defaulted back to the original Amy. When she shows back up later in the episode, she has no memory of being brought down there or the last few days, which makes sense if she wasn't actually down there.

What I'm trying to do is connect what happened in the first couple episodes back to Kovarian. Why was River with the Silence? Kovarian must have been in collusion with them, otherwise they wouldn't have made the Flesh copy of Amy. I'm guessing they sent little River there to be protected, but why the Silence? Why then? How did she get out of the spacesuit, and escape from the house? It appears it really was keeping her alive, seeing as she died after ditching it. Even that leads to many questions, like what happened next?

I think the biggest problem I have with your theory is about River song's ""programming"", given that she's not possessed by the Kovarian for very long.

[edit] Looking at [this infographic](http://i.imgur.com/KeO7F.jpg) describing the Doctor and River Song's timelines, I notice that River would have killed the Doctor before they get romantically involved.

&gt;do you mean having occupied beds adjacent to each other causes MRSA 

Of course not - it is a bacteria; one that is very persistent due to it's resistance to conventional antibiotics - it is also very common, at some point this year you will be carrying it without ill effects. It becomes a problem when there are wound sites such as post-surgery.

&gt;having people swapped into beds just as the bed has been emptied (so insufficient cleaning)

Yes exactly this, bed occupancy and turnover rates are indeed a factor and this is down to cleaning.

[This](http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7015/7/28) is an interesting paper that touches on the cleaning issue. There are other papers that deal with bed occupancy (not an issue in this study because there was similar bed occupancy rates throughout the study). 

Other studies have shown a strong relationship between bed occupancy, turnover-rates variables and MRSA and clearly cleaning is an issue. Yes, yes correlation != causation but statistically there appears to be quite a strong relationship between these variables.

Essentially because of its popularity. Labour opposed it throughout the eighties and into the nineties. Dropping it was like dropping their policy of unilateral nuclear disarmament. It was one of the cornerstones of  becoming electable again. 

Popularity isn't an indicator of whether something was right to do or not, but it is an indicator of whether you can stop it or intervene in anyway in a democracy. A major weakness of FPTP, in my usually ignored view.

&gt; But the fact is that DB failed to invest enough in its infrastructure at home as it expanded abroad and tried to drive up profits to prepare for a partial privatisation. Even now Berlin’s commuter trains cannot exceed 60kph (40mph) because of winter maintenance problems. 

Oh dear! Under investment, slow trains? Tsk tsk. 

&gt; How does that not make the UK transport service a joke in comparison?

Because you're wrong. It seems that Germany has its problems just as we do. Possibly worse than we do. At least Network Rail is underinvesting in its own country just because they're crap and because the government won't stop meddling, not because they're empire building in other parts of Europe (such as the UK).

Interestingly it says air traffic in the first story. Like how Heathrow was affected, then.

I'm not so sure. Our high-speed trains may not be as fast as theirs but that's not the only metric. It depends on what you are looking at.

I suppose you could be right. But in some areas, the trains we already have are crippled by the network. Down here there are regular HST services to London.

true,crucible,cnty-wales,Wales,"&gt;I suppose you could be right. But in some areas, the trains we already have are crippled by the network. Down here there are regular HST services to London. For roughly half of the journey (in terms of time), the HST is crawling along at anything up to 70mph, and after it gets most of the way through Devon the taps are opened up and finally it gets to do 100 to 125mph.


Heh, I think some of our American friends on Reddit would quite happily take a 70mph passenger service now. I read a comment from a guy saying that Amtrak were limited to 30mph across New York state because the freight companies which owned the track didn't need anything better for their trains.

But the twisty and hilly nature of the line in Devon and Cornwall doesn't help with high speed services, I agree. I can't see how you could rebuild the line to be any straighter without incurring massive costs :(

&gt;Of course they will. Anything that is a benefit to London or the South East is acceptable, but if it is some pesky regional line then only the bare minimum of investment to stop people dying.

I must be lucky, my local line here in North Wales has had a load of those electronic signs which tell you when your next train is arriving installed recently. I'm not sure if that's down to NR or Arriva though. Maybe Deutsche Bahn are flashing some cash? :)

I read a comment from a guy saying that Amtrak were limited to 30mph across New York state because the freight companies which owned the track didn't need anything better for their trains.

I've heard the same. But that's what you get when the freight companies own the track and can do what they want, whereas Network Rail can't although they give priority to the faster passenger services IIRC (which makes sense).

It doesn't help that no one wants to spend money over there to improve things - you have Republican governors who quash any effort to improve the transport infrastructure.

&gt; But the twisty and hilly nature of the line in Devon and Cornwall doesn't help with high speed services, I agree. I can't see how you could rebuild the line to be any straighter without incurring massive costs :(

You could be right. But thinking about it there's more than just speed. For example, the sole rail connection between Exeter and points west is basically on the Dawlish sea wall - which (IIRC) Network Rail has recently said is in a bit of danger of disappearing entirely.

It would help massively to build a second line between (at least) Exeter and Plymouth, and while they're at it they could try and spec it for ""high speed"" operation. Preferably before Cornwall and West Devon is cut off from the rail network.

&gt; I must be lucky, my local line here in North Wales has had a load of those electronic signs which tell you when your next train is arriving installed recently. I'm not sure if that's down to NR or Arriva though. Maybe Deutsche Bahn are flashing some cash? :)

It might be mandated in the franchise agreement. First Great Western had a commitment to overhaul their information systems down here, and (years later) they're finally doing it. They replaced the CRT-based system in many of their stations with LED signs that you can't see from most of the platform as they are obscured by the stairs/roof (at least from the station I use often), and at unstaffed stations they put ""help points"" with displays in.

Having said that, franchise agreements appear to mean nothing. I've read that Arriva still hasn't put WiFi in their CrossCountry trains (as per the agreement) because they can't be bothered and it is cheaper to pay any fines levied by the government. Could be wrong, though.

I'm surprised Arriva would spend any money unless they had to. Their CrossCountry franchise is a bit crap (no WiFi, no 3G reception, a poor food service, etc) and makes FGW look positively Rolls-Royce. I've heard that ATW is run on a similarly shoestring basis, with the only ""decent"" train being the one that is termed the ""WAG express"" because it ferries Assembly members about. Is this true?

&gt; Personally I think the HST will be the benchmark for high speed diesel trains for many years to come, and an example of what BR could once achieve.

http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/bbc-fights-to-suppress-internal-report-into-allegations-of-bias-against-israel-442150.html

The BBC was in court yesterday fighting over the public's right to know. But the Corporation was not battling to bring information into the open. Instead it has paid an estimated £200,000 in legal fees to keep the report secret.

The Corporation is trying to persuade the High Court to overrule a decision by the Information Tribunal that an internal report into the BBC's Middle East coverage should be made public.

---
In October 2004, as his one-year contract drew to a close, Mr Balen presented the BBC with a 20,000-page report. Those who accuse the BBC of anti-Israeli bias suspect that it supported their case but no one outside the BBC has been allowed to see it.

Mr Balen has gone on the record to say that he does not believe there is anti-Semitism in the BBC, but did imply that the Corporation had made "" mistakes"", which should not be seen as evidence of malice.

true,crucible,cnty-wales,Wales,"&gt;It doesn't help that no one wants to spend money over there to improve things - you have Republican governors who quash any effort to improve the transport infrastructure.

I think the car lobby is much stronger over there too - the car is such a part of American culture and I don't see that changing quickly.

&gt;It would help massively to build a second line between (at least) Exeter and Plymouth, and while they're at it they could try and spec it for ""high speed"" operation. Preferably before Cornwall and West Devon is cut off from the rail network.

The north of both counties seem devoid of rail. Phase 1 can be to link Barnstaple and Bideford. perhaps? :)

Dawlish is wonderfully scenic, but must be suffering from erosion massively.

&gt;Having said that, franchise agreements appear to mean nothing. I've read that Arriva still hasn't put WiFi in their CrossCountry trains (as per the agreement) because they can't be bothered and it is cheaper to pay any fines levied by the government. Could be wrong, though.

I've head that. I wonder how that argument will play out when the passenger says ""but Virgin/First/East Coast have wifi!""

&gt;I'm surprised Arriva would spend any money unless they had to. Their CrossCountry franchise is a bit crap (no WiFi, no 3G reception, a poor food service, etc) and makes FGW look positively Rolls-Royce. I've heard that ATW is run on a similarly shoestring basis, with the only ""decent"" train being the one that is termed the ""WAG express"" because it ferries Assembly members about. Is this true?

Yes and no. Most of the stuff up here in the north is quite good - the Pacers are all down south on the Cardiff/Swansea/Valleys lines. Arriva is on a ""zero growth"" basis to the franchise end in 2018 I believe - ie they predict no increases in passenger numbers during their franchise. As such we get minimal investment in new rolling stock.

What we have is good - the 150s came from all over the country so have all been refurbished inside and repainted by Arriva. 158s are currently going through a WAG funded refurbishment programme - new interiors and an exterior repaint. 153s are also being refurbished internally by Arriva on a similar scheme. 175s have all just been done - interior refurb and some mechanical work. These trains are now 10 years old and ex-First North Western. They spent 6 years getting the bugs and glitches sorted before Arriva took them.

The WAG Express is a Plaid Cymru thing designed to ""unify"" North and South Wales. In reality it was a political thing and doesn't really need a first class dining car. There's going to be a second one running from the Autumn. The feeling in the North is that the business and economic connections in Flintshire and Wrexham counties is more with Liverpool / Manchester / Chester and Shropshire, even Birmingham. Not much demand for trains to South Wales.

Plaid have now been voted out in favour of Labour, so it will be interesting to see how long the WAG Express lasts. The second one is already funded for something like seven years and Wrexham has lost some morning Birmingham trains to accommodate it. Plus we lost the Wrexham and Shropshire services in March.

&gt;I have very limited experience of the newer, non-BR stock, but certainly anything BR made is just better. Feels better built, doesn't seem like they've tried to squash the maximum number of seats in, I can actually get a mobile phone reception, etc.

Agreed, modern stuff feels cramped and they keep trying to make the trains like planes with all unidirectional seating.

What's to stop a future government taking ownership of the track (which did happen) and progressively taking over each of the franchises as they came up for renewal - and during the Labour government every franchise has come up at least once, if not twice. I guess there may be potential competition issues (the EU loves competition) but it's not as if SNCF or DB have to compete.

The fact that Labour did *nothing* speaks volumes. The only thing they did was Network Rail, but as I said that's only because they really had no choice (Railtrack was incompetent and on the verge of bankruptcy), and even then Stephen Byers (transport minister at the time) lied to get it done. East Coast, if you count that, is only how it is because National Express abandoned the franchise, not because the government wanted it.

We see that even NR's management isn't exactly a model of brilliance, and the convoluted ownership structure only complicates things (which I have heard is due to potential legal action from ex-Railtrack shareholders if they did it properly).",0,1309206410,null,0,true,0,c2289rx,t3_ia8lc,t1_c2289rx,t1_c2288rk,1427290604,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

The track operator is government owned, but is run at great lengths from the government, and is also profit-making. Whether it was truly nationalised is debatable.

DB has a fairly large percentage ownership by the German government, doesn't it? 

It also makes you wonder whether a ""British Rail plc"" would have done a better job than the present system (I seem to recall John Major favouring this structure). A vertically integrated operator (track, trains, equipment manufacturer) might have done well. 

But we have a system where the train companies don't want to invest in new trains because by the time they're built they may not be able to make use of them (I'm aware that they generally don't own the trains) and so there is no drive for improvement - and the government micromanages every little thing, to the point where even a simple exercise like buying new trains becomes ""the successful bidder will build a UK factory to assemble the trains"".",0,1309209312,null,0,true,0,c228lwc,t3_ia8lc,t1_c228lwc,t1_c228kmh,1427290762,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

If councils improved their procurement and joint working on waste services, councils could afford to offer more frequent and regular rubbish collections. There's no excuse for cutting the front line when there are so many savings to be found in the way back office services and run and paid for.""*

He's talking about the definition of Doctor Who related content that belongs in this subreddit, and content that does not.  And yes, for the most part the Upvote/Downvote system isn't half bad, but it's not perfect and certainly does not work every time.  It especially doesn't work when people upvote the wrong thing.  

I know, it seems impossible to upvote a wrong thing, but bare with me for a second.  

Imagine you made a subreddit for flowers.  You posted pictures of flowers, talked about them, and everything was good.  But then someone posts a picture of a bee on a flower.  Then another.  Then another.  People start talking about bees.  Posting pictures of bees.  Bees everywhere.  

There's nothing wrong with bees.  You may like bees, in fact.  However, the fact of the matter is that you wanted to talk about flowers, not bees.  But they make it to the front page!  People want to talk about bees.  They say ""downvote it if you don't like it and stop complaining!""  Arg, you might say.  But there's nothing you can do about it.  Direct democracy has spoken and your flower subreddit has become a bee circle jerk.  

The problem is that the people don't always know what's best.  That's why we have several mods for bigger boards.  Remember the whole ""No, THIS is the greatest sidekick of all time"" scandal?  People were upvoting those submissions to the front page, but most everyone hated them.  The mods had to step in and fix the problem.  

So yeah.  I definitely see where everyone is coming from in this argument.  Although the upvote/downvote system works to a point, unless we reform the way we think about Doctor Who content, we'll get a whole subreddit full of TARDIS cakes and random statues with headlines like ""Don't Blink, lawl""     

Edit: To clarify, the bees metaphor was intended to be an exaggeration.  ""Bees are flower related, therefore should be allowed on this subreddit,"" was the intended idea.  A lot of this content is borderline Doctor Who related, which is the point of the original submission.  Let's open a discussion about what is related and what isn't, and when certain things become a nuisance.  It's about quality.

true,TheStupidBurns,null,null,"&gt; ""In far more episodes a female companion is present.""

Well, that's probably true but that is part of why I provided the link.  By simple numbers about half as many males have been a companion to the doctor as have females... overall.  However if you look at the break down and number of episodic appearances as a companion it gets much more interesting.

Up through the 5th doctor you are at least as likely to see a man with the Doctor as a woman, (perhaps more so).  It isn't till the 6th Doctor where you see exclusively female companions, and though that carries through to the 8th Doctor those three doctors were also much more stable in the companions they kept.

Getting to the new Doctor Who, (9th on), you then have a different dynamic again in what is dictating the Doctors choice of companions.  Even so, there is a return to the inclusion of male companions, (Micky, Jack, and with the most recent Rory).  If anything, the Doctor's traveling with multiple companions of mixed gender more recently is a *return* to his 'Traditional' self in the move away from gender biased companionship, (eg.. back towards his original approach when he was the first 5 of himself), instead of a departure from tradition.

Which is why I hesitate to just say his ""companions are traditionally female"".  Because it isn't really true when you really start looking into the whole history of the Doctor.  That said, in my memory, the female companions have always had more influence with him which is a point worth noting.

Contact your uni career centre. They should have books of &gt;200 pages where each page is a graduate job at a large corporation. They gave them away at my uni (Aston University). I got three separate ones (times100, targetJobs, and another - check the webs).

Next, spend your nights going page to page and apply for them all. Even if they are not within your area directly...it cant hurt. At the start it will take you over an hour per one but as you save your answers to use another time, it can get down to about 30 mins.


Don't start on the companies you want to work for - your first bulk of applications will no doubt be shit so use the early ones as practice. Learn how to market yourself to the company - emphasise what you do and can do that is relevant to them (i.e., edit your CV for each).


Get a few team based hobbies (I do rock climbing, boxing, running, and am part of a team of students that are designing, building, testing, and racing a race car, play strategy games) so you can demonstrate you are all about people. Your degree will get you at the door - and your personality and proof of how personable you are will get you through it.


Remember that they generally do not want a person for what they have learned at uni - they want someone who *can learn* and can work with others. Demonstrate this. If you have not yet, join clubs and what not to whack onto your CV. 


when it comes to interviews make a connection with each person you interact with (I shared hobbies with about 4 of the senior managers that were interviewing the group I was in on the day - certainly helped) - find one, no matter how small.

The places I worked it was quite rare to have a degree - so much so that people used to make special mention of it. One of my team leaders used to call me ""professor"" for Christ's sake. Although this sort of light ridiculing might seem borderline offensive, it also meant I was offered different/further opportunities compared to other staff. Of course, given the state of the economy and the number of graduates being produced each year, it might be less rare now / in certain places.

4. This may make me sound like an Uncle Tom , but I think it gave me a healthy respect for every job I've had since. I worked with a graduate more recently who went straight from University to a reasonably decent role at about £26k and I noticed his attitude was fairly crummy. I don't think he realised how good his job was compared to the alternatives and it really showed in his demeanour. Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying anyone should be on their knees thanking masser for their lot, but I think it's healthy to realise that there's a whole bunch of mother fuckers out there who have it worse than you - and I'm not even talking about the one billion plus people who don't have enough food.  

Anyway, in the second call centre I worked at, after about seven months I applied for an internal vacancy which led to a better job and ultimately to a career of sorts. I ended up doing various different jobs within the company and worked there for eight years - my salary went from £5 per hour (when I first started) to £43k a year when I left last year. A lot of companies with largish call centres will use them as a method of recruiting for other posts - it's quite hard to recruit good people to mid-level jobs so if someone is spotted in a low level position who is smarter than your average bear they might well be flagged for / offered internal advancement after a while.

**tl;dr** : Call-centres can lead to opportunities even though I concede they can be shit sometimes.

true,dontgoatsemebro,null,null,"[Railtrack PLC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Railtrack) was the company responsible for the infrastructure of the national railway network from 1994 - 2002, it was founded under the Conservative governement that privatised the railways, it was a publicly traded company and had nothing to do with the government.  
  
They were under constant criticism for failing to adhere to their responsibilities to maintain the network, which was not enforced by the three times appointed conservative regulator [John Swift.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Swift_QC)  
  
Then [Hatfield](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hatfield_train_crash) happened in 2000, a direct result of Railtraks dismissal of it's own engineering talent.  
  
&gt;The rail infrastructure company Railtrack, having divested much of the engineering knowledge of British Rail into maintenance contractors, had inadequate maintenance records and no accessible asset register. It did not know how much other ""gauge corner cracking"" around the network could lead to a Hatfield-like accident. Railtrack imposed over 1,200 emergency speed restrictions and *instigated a nationwide (and costly) track replacement programme.*  
  
Suprise suprise, that's when Railtrak came to the government seeking funding to cover the loss of £500m it was making (this is from what was a profit before it was privatised). After securing government funding, it then proceeded to **issue a £140m dividend to it's shareholders!**  
  
After Railtrak realised how much it was going to cost to repair the infrastructure it had fucked up, it decided to throw in the towel and disolve. Bidding was opened to the private sector but nobody was interested because it was such a clusterfuck, so it was left to the government in 2002 to *buy back*(!) the same company that had fucked the network in the first place.  
  
So yeah sure, at the *moment* the government is responsible for maintaining the network, and the taxpayer bears the costs. But where exactly do the profits go? Who takes the ticket receipts? Of course, the privately owned Train Operating Companies!

The TOCs are able to keep the profits in line with their franchise agreements - but IIRC it isn't as easy as ""you can keep all the profits"", as it depends on what the franchise agreement says and what the profit predictions were. Too much profit = government takes it, no profit = government subsidises.

The fares are mostly regulated and there is a highly complex system that decides who gets what, based on usage and who runs how many services (ORCATS).

Network Rail (the government owned track operator) made a £2bn profit this year. That's nice, isn't it? Seems that they're not doing a good job at keeping the trains running though.

I loved City of Death because of the humor found all through it and the fine performances by everybody involved, but it's much slower than modern Doctor Who. It's an investigation story, not an action story strapped onto an investigation one (like so many of the current episodes are).

My first Classic Who was The Three Doctors, which is available via instant view. 

Doctor Who and The Aztecs is also a great story featuring the first Doctor back when the show was still about teaching history and science, not fighting monsters. 

One thing almost all Classic Who episodes have is elongated story-telling. Basically they take a story that would be told in one episode today and split it into 2 or 3 30 minute episodes. City of Death is a great example. That story would be one 43 minute episode today, but they stretched it out for 90 minutes. Part of it was a different viewer expectation but I also think that part of it was due to budget constraints. If you can make one set or location last for 4 episodes instead of 2 you've cut your costs in half.

There wasn't much assessment in the article though, you basically went 'Ooh, I like these two' without giving reasons. I agree with you that Carragher and Skrtel are our best pairing, when Agger is injured.

With Agger and Skrtel playing in the league, with Carragher as sub/injury cover, I'd play Carra and Kelly in any cup competitions, to give Agger and Skrtel a bit of rest, but also to help Kelly.

I would fucking throw money at this shit. I would throw money at letmewatchthis. I signed up for love film, and their catalogue of online streaming was fucking shocking, so i cancelled. They offered to double the amount i could watch, for the same price. I politely told them to fuck off, I can't find anything to watch anyway. It's so dumb. And then the film industry goes and promotes a website where i can get for free something that i would be more than happy to pay for. If they pulled their fingers out and offered me a great streaming services, they wouldn't have half the problems.

The media industry is in a quagmire of idiocy. The old guard is refusing to bow to market forces, and that's what's fucking them in the ass. They're being dragged kicking and screaming into the 21st century, and the sooner they embrace it, the sooner they'll reap the rewards. People  want to watch tv online. TV that was part of an ISP data plan would destroy the market. It's as simple as that. Provide that service, or face the consequences. People think music is overpriced - provide cheaper downloads, and reorganise your business model to capitalise on merchandising, tours, advertising etc. They don't really have a choice in the matter, the market has made its feelings clear.

Yet the whole of the entertainment industry would rather invest money in shutting down people that in reality they should just be imitating. The entertainment industry needs to focus more on what people want. I will gladly pirate media, out of spite, until they do this.

I seriously doubt they'd go about snooping on my PPP session (which is between my modem and my ISP's kit, not BT) and injecting its own traffic in response to pages that I visit. 

Even if it were technically possible there'd be an absolute shitstorm. BT are contracted to provide the ADSL connection and a way to link that connection to my ISP, they aren't contracted for anything else. What traffic passes along that link isn't BT's business.
