It is endemic with pre paid meters and electric companies, no matter which one it is.  Given that prepaid meters are often fitted to resolve problems with debt, it is not uncommon to still have debt running on the meter. (Why do I feel I am stating the obvious here?)

Blaming the shop for not setting the key right, blaming the key, blaming the account holder, all the first line 'reasons' they give, and the OP is not the first person to have been told they cannot remove the debt.   The only way it is usually solved is if an engineer is sent out, they appear to have a cerebellum, and know what they are doing unlike many of the customer support assistants.

At this point I went outside and sat on a stoop adjacent to the bar, trying, and failing not to cry.  I gathered myself and walked a few blocks to a british store the town was lucky enough to support.  To calm my nerves, I purchased a pack of dunhills, even though I wasn't a smoker.  Arriving back at the bar, me and joe exchanged obsessive drinking for obsessive smoking. With each goal Liverpool scored, we leapt in the air and embraced.

Flatmates Matthew Swale and Melanie Cunningham were terrified when they woke early one morning to discover a hoodie-wearing gang armed with crowbars hammering on their front door and shouting obscenities.
And the couple were even more distraught after the unknown intruders sprayed chemicals through their letterbox in a bid to subdue Matthew's anxious labrador.
But their fear has now been replaced by anger after it was revealed that the 7am raid last month was carried out by authorised bailiffs sent to sort out an unpaid gas bill - which had been left by a former tenant.

Terrified: Matthew Swale and his labrador Jake were the unfortunate victims of an early-morning raid by npower bailiffs
And now Matthew and Melanie are demanding compensation from energy supplier npower after having to pay hundreds of pounds in vet and repair bills.
Market trader Matthew, 28, and Melanie, 29, moved into the Grimsby railway cottage at the beginning of September and insist that they and their landlady contacted npower to inform them of the new tenancy.

Energy firms ordered to switch customers within three weeks
But six weeks later, the company sent in the bailiffs because the previous tenant had still not paid bills totalling £980. The bailiffs were instructed to rip out the gas meter and replace it with a pre-pay one.
'I looked out of the window and saw a group of men wearing scruffy hoodies and tracksuit bottoms who had driven up in a pick-up truck,' Matthew told the Sunday Mirror.
'The man in charge was shouting, ""It will make your life a lot easier if you answer the f***ing door"".
'I thought they looked dangerous. They were kicking my front door and trying to open it with a crowbar. My flatmate was in tears.'
Matthew said he called the police rather than open the door because the gang - some of whom were sitting on the bonnet of his car - refused to reveal their identities.

Missing the target: Although bailiffs had the correct address, they did not realise that the tenant who owed npower money had moved out of the property almost two months earlier
After failing to gain access, the bailiffs shot chemical spray into the eyes of Matthew's labrador, Jake, before breaking in through a back door.
Matthew was eventually able to convince them they had targeted the wrong man by producing his driving licence and his tenancy agreement.
He claims his dog needed £350 worth of veterinary treatment and he has also had to pay out an additional £400 to get his doors repaired.
'Jake is the most placid dog you could imagine,' Matthew said.
'When they sprayed him, he just collapsed on the floor. he was throwing up and his eyes were watering. I thought he was going to die.
'Since this happened I have telephoned npower dozens of times but nothing has been done.'
Last month regulator Ofgem hit npower with a £2million fine for its sloppy customer service.
An npower spokesman told MailOnline that a trained dog handler had used the spray because 'the dog was still being aggressive and we were unable to gain access' - but insisted it was harmless and had no long-term effects.
The spokesman acknowledged that a door lock had been drilled out but that 'both the dog and the door were inspected prior to leaving by both the police and the agent and were deemed to be fine'.
And the company denied that Matthew had made contact to tell them he was a new tenant.
'We cannot stress enough the importance of letting your energy supplier know as soon as you move in to make sure you're not picking up the previous tenant's bills,' the spokesman said.
'We will only ever visit a property under these circumstances when all other options have been exhausted - and all personnel on site adhere to strict guidelines and we feel they were fully complied with in this instance.
'We would be more than happy to check any vet bills the owners says he has had to bear.'

But ultimately, this is an active forum where people are discussing a show that has been on the air for longer than many of us have been alive. Everyone is at different stages in their viewing process. Pretty much every post is going to be a spoiler for someone.  I think identifying the season/doctor in the title is really the best solution. For instance, this post explicitly states it's something mind blowing in Season 3. Someone that has not seen Season 3 will have to decide if they want to click on a mind-blowing link about it.

For shows that have aired recently (the 48 hours minimum listed in the sidebar under spoiler policy), the spoiler tag is a necessity. But for everything prior, simply identifying the era should be sufficient.

""Have you ever heard of this show Doctor Who?""

She told me it was about a 900 year old alien traveling through time and space in a police box. I kind of gaped at her, went WHAT.

So I went home and YouTubed it. The first thing I saw was some skinny *idiot* shouting about everything in front of him. And then the next brief clip I saw was of a red bus flying through a desert chased by manta rays. And I was all ""Oh *HELL* no!""

It was not until she sat me down in front of Blink months later that I was really interested. It was on Youtube and after the first video ended she said,

""You don't have to watch anymore if you don't want to.""

And I, ""No, no, it's fine. Play the next bit.""

I did some research and learned that I could start with the 2005 relaunch easily enough, so I booted up Netflix, found ""Rose"" and settled in with a glass of water and my towel.

From the moment that Nine appeared onscreen, I was captivated. I'd done enough reading to know the basic premises of the show, but I was experiencing it for the first time. And without any sort of rational explanation, I was prepared to follow the Doctor wherever he might lead, from that moment forward.

Fun fact, the first time I watched ""Blink"" was about a week after that. It was 4 in the morning and I was hopped up on Vicodin and unable to sleep. I'd heard a lot about how great ""Blink"" supposedly was, but had no information whatsoever about what the episode was about. So I decided, ""heck, why not?"" and clicked the episodes. 4:00 AM.

Apology accepted.

It would appear you already had. 

&gt;bow down to your no doubt superior knowledge of the subject

Get up off the floor, you will make your knees dirty. 

&gt; FYI it's not an 'engineer' that is sent out if we cannot reset a meter remotely, they are called meter operatives and get a few weeks training to do a simple job.

You best tell Southern that then, and every other energy company that calls them engineers. Pretty impressive that a few weeks training means they can change the batteries in a meter, reset it, reprogramme it and importantly take debt off. 

&gt;Do you actually have front line experience of dealing with these problems yourself?

I have wide experience of dealing with obnoxious unhelpful twats. I also have years of dealing with the public under my belt, so while I am naturally sympathetic to the customer support assistants, I do know that dealing with the public is not an excuse to give poor service.  But I guess my main qualification is being one of the poor sods who have had to endure the 'customer service' put out by Southern Electric, and other energy companies in the past. Hence I have learnt their standard practises of being extremely unhelpful and making the account holder feel quite helpless and at their mercy. Hence I gave the advice to the OP.

I eventually dismissed it as an old show with crappy special effects and never gave it a second glance.

A few months ago I went into a electronics store and noticed they had a whole section of Doctor Who featuring the new Doctors. Confused as to why there is a ""Series 1-5"" of a show that is nearly 50 years old, I decided to read some reviews on Amazon and Wiki'd the rest. I was intrigued by the concepts of time travel, regeneration, and the general humor from the show. Tired of serious science fiction shows, I decided to watch a few episodes on Netflix and immediately fell in love with it!

Since then I've gotten a few people into the series who feel practically the same way and I've started watching some of the older episodes. It's amazing how the general design of some of the aliens haven't changed too much over the years, yet how the show still manages to create an impact without feeling too cheesy and out of date through excellent writing and acting.

Of course, there are any number of events where The Doctor meddles with his own past (to quote Rory: ""To be fair, the Universe did explode.""). The Doctor seems to have gotten pretty adapt at jamming spaghetti timelines into a box.

Of course, he's not that good. In my opinion, the Web of Time is becoming more and more unstable since the Time War.

As for the tardis exploding, I'm not sure, could have been River, which would explain why she's sorry. Or maybe it isn't her, but she's sorry that she's dying and won't be able to spend more time with him (I doubt she knew about the temporal loop safety). The explosion could have been caused directly by the silence, they were able to keep the link up between Amy and the Flesh Amy the entire time while they were travelling, so perhaps they could have done that remotely too, hoping that sealing the Doctor in the pandorica would be enough. Which would explain why they move to try and kill him in the next series, locking him up didn't work after all.

If you are rearing animals for slaughter, you can only get replacements within a certain time frame, then it's mainly economics that take over as there is a point when the cost of regularly feeding the animal is greater than the value of the meat it produces.

At that point, you have to slaughter the stock and sell it to break even (or do so sooner to make a profit).

Then meat processing takes over to ensure the meat supply lasts until the next breeding season - in the past, salting or smoking, and today refrigeration and artificial preservatives.

&gt; the planning has been poor so far

Really? The venues are all going to be ready well ahead of time. Haven't seen anything that would indicate problems for the event. They need 10k more security guards, but they learned this well ahead of the games and have ample time to arrange it, they've already been told they can have 3000 to 5000 squadies.

&gt; to top it off the country is now in a miserable period of economic malaise

If only we could have seen the state the economy would be in today 6 years ago when we were awarded the games. Unfortunately we were far past the point of no return. This would have been the same on which ever country hosts the games. It could be argued that an event like this could help lift the spirits of the nation, albeit only temporarily.

&gt; the games don't seem like a wise investment

I guess this is subjective. Clearly we wont make a profit from the games, but some people value the extra tourism (businesses for example) other will value the new and improved sporting venues we'll have afterwards. Some people just enjoy a chance to see their country on the world stage.

It's not just the cooking time though. The time it takes to select and prep your ingredients is going to be longer than it takes to pick up a jar. Obviously homemade sauces are going to taste better and they're not difficult, but the convenience factor and peoples confidence in the kitchen is what really makes the difference. Dolmio is triple-strength shit though.

&gt;It's how Thai restaurants do it. I mean you fanny about making your own paste, but that does take a long time.

Professional kitchens almost always use some pre-prepared ingredients. You're still not making a meal from scratch if you do the same. It doesn't take long to make a paste anyway. Five minutes chopping your veg, two minutes to toast your spices, a few minutes in a food processor and you're done.

&gt;Oh and the Asda and Tesco green pastes aren't the same at all, they're altered to suit our western tastes even though they're the same brands.

Ah humour: The subjective wonder.

So long as you remember that Brooker isn't writing in a researchy-journo type way, his opinion pieces aren't necessarily meant to be breaking ground in terms of newsworthiness.

Interestingly I didn't read the article and conclude as you did, that Brooker was implying: ""If you play MW3 maybe you're gay"".    
What I read from it was that the game is overly macho in so far as to render the attempt homoerotic. That doesn't mean there's anything wrong with being gay and I have no doubt that Brooker is anti-homophobe.

&gt; The article is neither thought-provoking nor witty

I think it is both, considering how the argument that video games leads people to be violent is still ongoing and has been for decades.

The Guardian just published an investigative piece I wrote about the BBC's successful petition to cripple its public broadcasts with DRM. Nearly everyone who commented on the proposal to the regulator, Ofcom, hated it, but Ofcom granted permission to use DRM anyway. The BBC and Ofcom said that the convincing arguments were in the secret, redacted text of a memo the BBC wrote to Ofcom, and both refused to release the memo, even after Freedom of Information requests were filed, citing ""commercial sensitivity."" I published the secret text in my article and as you can see, it's neither ""commercially sensitive,"" nor convcincing. Our regulator is allowing the BBC to lock up the TV we're required by law to pay for, to give new privileges to American broadcasters that they are denied in the USA, and they're citing ""commercial sensitivity"" to keep up from finding out why.

By ADAM DAWTREY

LONDON -- ""Harry Potter"" director David Yates is teaming up with the BBC to turn its iconic sci-fi TV series ""Doctor Who"" into a bigscreen franchise.
Yates, who directed the last four Potter films, told Daily Variety that he is about to start work on developing a ""Doctor Who"" movie with Jane Tranter, BBC Worldwide's L.A.-based exec VP of programming and production.

""We're looking at writers now. We're going to spend two to three years to get it right,"" he said. ""It needs quite a radical transformation to take it into the bigger arena.""

""Doctor Who"" follows the adventures across space and time of a super-intelligent alien in human form, who battles a variety of cosmic bad guys aided by plucky human companions.

""The notion of the time-travelling Time Lord is such a strong one, because you can express story and drama in any dimension or time,"" Yates said.

The series ran from 1963 to 1989, and then was successfully rebooted in 2005 by writer Russell T. Davies and subsequently by Steven Moffat (""The Adventures of Tintin""). Tranter oversaw the revival when she was the BBC's drama topper in London.

""Doctor Who,"" starring Matt Smith as the 11th incarnation of the Doctor, is now one of the pubcaster's most lucrative global TV franchises.

The series airs Stateside on BBC America.

Yates made clear that his movie adaptation would not follow on from the current TV series, but would take a completely fresh approach to the material.

""Russell T. Davies and then Steven Moffat have done their own transformations, which were fantastic, but we have to put that aside and start from scratch,"" he said.

Yates and Tranter are looking for writers on both sides of the Atlantic.

""We want a British sensibility, but having said that, Steve Kloves wrote the Potter films and captured that British sensibility perfectly, so we are looking at American writers too,"" he explained.

There are two previous films, based on the TV series: ""Doctor Who and the Daleks"" (1965) and ""Doctor Who: Daleks' Invasion Earth 2150 A.D."" (1966), both starring Peter Cushing.

The BBC has since made a few unsuccessful attempts to develop a ""Doctor Who"" feature, and shot a one-off telepic in 1996 at a time when the TV series was dormant.

But the combination of Yates and Tranter means this is the most high-powered effort to date to launch ""Doctor Who"" onto the bigscreen.

Before directing ""Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,"" ""Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince"" and both parts of ""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows,"" Yates worked with Tranter on several BBC TV series, including ""The Way We Live Now"" and ""State of Play.""",0,1321298017,null,0,false,0,c2zpsgn,t3_mc0xm,t1_c2zpsgn,t3_mc0xm,1427876511,14,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,14

""start from scratch"". Why? It's going to be completely different from the series. Moffat would be well suited to writing a movie; no grand scheming story arcs, just a single film with a single story. Right up his street.

&gt;Yates to direct bigscreen 'Doctor Who'
&gt;'Potter' helmer, BBC working on pic of sci-fi TV series
&gt;By ADAM DAWTREY
&gt;LONDON -- ""Harry Potter"" director David Yates is teaming up with the BBC to turn its iconic sci-fi TV series ""Doctor Who"" into a bigscreen franchise.
&gt;Yates, who directed the last four Potter films, told Daily Variety that he is about to start work on developing a ""Doctor Who"" movie with Jane Tranter, BBC Worldwide's L.A.-based exec VP of programming and production.
&gt;
&gt;""We're looking at writers now. We're going to spend two to three years to get it right,"" he said. ""It needs quite a radical transformation to take it into the bigger arena.""
&gt;
&gt;""Doctor Who"" follows the adventures across space and time of a super-intelligent alien in human form, who battles a variety of cosmic bad guys aided by plucky human companions.
&gt;
&gt;""The notion of the time-travelling Time Lord is such a strong one, because you can express story and drama in any dimension or time,"" Yates said.
&gt;
&gt;The series ran from 1963 to 1989, and then was successfully rebooted in 2005 by writer Russell T. Davies and subsequently by Steven Moffat (""The Adventures of Tintin""). Tranter oversaw the revival when she was the BBC's drama topper in London.
&gt;
&gt;""Doctor Who,"" starring Matt Smith as the 11th incarnation of the Doctor, is now one of the pubcaster's most lucrative global TV franchises.
&gt;
&gt;The series airs Stateside on BBC America.
&gt;
&gt;Yates made clear that his movie adaptation would not follow on from the current TV series, but would take a completely fresh approach to the material.
&gt;
&gt;""Russell T. Davies and then Steven Moffat have done their own transformations, which were fantastic, but we have to put that aside and start from scratch,"" he said.
&gt;
&gt;Yates and Tranter are looking for writers on both sides of the Atlantic.
&gt;
&gt;""We want a British sensibility, but having said that, Steve Kloves wrote the Potter films and captured that British sensibility perfectly, so we are looking at American writers too,"" he explained.
&gt;
&gt;There are two previous films, based on the TV series: ""Doctor Who and the Daleks"" (1965) and ""Doctor Who: Daleks' Invasion Earth 2150 A.D."" (1966), both starring Peter Cushing.
&gt;
&gt;The BBC has since made a few unsuccessful attempts to develop a ""Doctor Who"" feature, and shot a one-off telepic in 1996 at a time when the TV series was dormant.
&gt;
&gt;But the combination of Yates and Tranter means this is the most high-powered effort to date to launch ""Doctor Who"" onto the bigscreen.
&gt;
&gt;Before directing ""Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,"" ""Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince"" and both parts of ""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows,"" Yates worked with Tranter on several BBC TV series, including ""The Way We Live Now"" and ""State of Play.""

To rephrase my prior point: The studios don't care about your established based if it's a miniscule sub-set (which, let's be fair, is certainly the case if you're comparing Doctor Who against say Lost or even Battlestar Galactica).

It doesn't appear that you've read the article so let's clear some things up:  This movie will *not* be aimed at fans of the existing series.  They're rebooting the entire concept from the ground up. That means no previous Doctors, no Moffat, no Davies, etc.  This will be squarely aimed at a broad audience that has no connection to Doctor Who.  Yates states as much rather plainly in the article.

true,johnno333,null,null,"Spanish slang may get Suarez off the hook

Use of word 'negrito' is key part of Liverpool striker's defence as race row with Evra rumbles on.


Patrice Evra is aware that the nuances of South American slang may prevent him from demonstrating that he was the victim of racist abuse from Liverpool's Luis Suarez in Manchester United's league match at Anfield last month.

Sources in France suggested last night that the word Evra says he heard Suarez utter several times in the second half of the game may be negrito, a South American term which is generally affectionate, but sometimes – as in this context – a way of poking fun.

It translates as ""little black fella"" though is such a common part of the Spanish vernacular that team-mates use it on each other. A tweet that was sent on Friday from Dani Pachecho to his Spain U21 team-mate Thiago translated as: ""Negrito. Enjoy yourself there and if you need anything the lion will come to the rescue haha...""

If negrito was the word Suarez used, then Evra's shock is understandable if he did not understand the context in which that particular piece of vernacular is used.

But in Uruguay and Argentina, the use of the word negro and negrito by commentators describing Premier League players is common. Visitors to South America often find that shocking if they are unaware of the nuance but the Spanish word negro for the colour black is pronounced differently to the offensive ""negro"" and one has nothing to do with the other. Un hombre negro means ""black man"". Affixing 'ito' and 'ita' on the end of words is to express that something is smaller.

The possibility of negrito being the offending expression explains why Suarez said in midweek that his own words were not an insult but just his own ""way of expressing myself. I called him something his team-mates at Manchester call him, and even they were surprised by his reaction"".Suarez said ""there were two parts of the discussion, one in Spanish, one in English"", and it is is possible that David de Gea and Javier Hernandez – the members of United's Spanish-speaking fraternity on the pitch that day – may have evidence relevant to Suarez's claims.

The expression is certainly a very long way from Luis Aragones referring to Henry as negro de mierda back in 2004. Though Liverpool manager Kenny Dalglish has been deeply critical of the time it has taken the Football Association to conclude this investigation, the complexities do reveal what the authorities are up against. Dalglish's complaints were premature and unjustified.

Meanwhile, Suarez has revealed his desire to remain at Liverpool for many years to come. He has made an excellent start to life on Merseyside and admits he feels completely at home in England and believes it would be difficult to re-create his level of satisfaction anywhere else in the world.

Suarez said: ""I've just started a phase of my career which I always dreamed about and wanted to do, which is to play for Liverpool. I have five years left on my contract and I think beyond that, I'm already thinking about staying many more years at Liverpool.

""It's a club I like. I feel very good about being here, about being in the city. I feel very pleased. It would be difficult to match the atmosphere, hunger for success and glory that this club has, at another team.""

Suarez also spoke about netting four times in a World Cup qualifier against Chile last Friday night. The striker joked that his Uruguayan team-mates had joked that he could even have doubled his tally had he not been substituted after 76 minutes as a precautionary measure.

Suarez, who scored all four in a 4-0 win, said: ""You always dream about scoring goals and scoring four in a game is not easy, but if it wasn't for the efforts of my team mates, I would not have scored the goals.

This is entirely subjective.  I'm only in my twenties, but I grew up with my parents watching TNG, DS9, or Voyager every week.  I know old Trek (hell, I even have the animated series on DVD), and I **loved** the movie.  So did most of my friends who have any familiarity with the franchise.  Just because you didn't like it doesn't mean that nobody else did.

&gt;That's not true. The 09 movie came out 7 years after the previous film and 4 years after the last Star Trek TV show.

And when there had been at least one Star Trek series on the air since '87 and movies every three years or so before that, I'd say that counts as a ""while"".

they cover their eyes, and only one is ever looking (I'm not sure how they would coordinate or communicate with each other but there are certainly ways for them to do so). Further more, in ""Blink"" I don't think we know whether or not the Angels are working together or not. They could be competing predators all trying to hunt the same prey. If we consider Weeping Angel A, B, and prey C and D; then if Angel is A is about to sneak up on prey C then competing Angel B merely has to be  behind A when A is about to capture prey C so that A is immobilized and B can take prey C as long as B continues to look at A without allowing A to look at B. So despite their quick speed, if the angels are competing and not working in packs, then it could very well be the slower angels that are the most succesful when competing with other angels.
 Also even if two look at each other, nothing is to stop say an unwary person, or any non-observant barrier coming between the two Angels. breaking their observation of one another and allowing them to move.
And in ""The Time of Angels"" and ""Flesh and Stone"", they turn out the lights so that it is pitch black so even if they are looking at each other they wouldn't be able to see anyways. The huge hoard of angels is fairly ridiculous, but again maybe they were competing, for their own individual survival. The angels in ""Flesh and Stone"" seem to be facing the same way for the most part so the angels in the back of the crowd can freely move forward; however, they must make sure to keep the other angels out of their peripheral vision. 
The biggest problem is still that the Doctor receives and keeps an image of the Angels in ""Blink"" .",0,1321312102,null,0,false,0,c2zs0xn,t3_mc6o9,t1_c2zs0xn,t3_mc6o9,1427877560,5,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,5

They try to keep everything abstract and theoretical, sometimes in cases where we (the students in general, as I haven't hit these particular modules yet) really wish they wouldn't.

That said we as students (myself especially as a Liaison) are actively involved with the staff in explaining our concerns, and major changes have been and continue to be made in regards to module content. Also, shameless plug for COMPSOC, the mostly-official society for our department which I am President of, because we as a society are ensuring there're activities ranging from weekly movie nights to weekly project days to singular projects such as our recent attendance at [DevXS](http://devxs.org/). And that's only the stuff we've arranged in our first month of being a society, we have plenty more planned.

People within the University are definitely easy to talk to, and between your fellows on your course and any societies you choose to join up with (choose many is my top recommendation to you, as they are extremely varied and a great way to meet new people) you should be able to make a solidly-formed group within just a couple of weeks of arriving. People on the street are just about as awkward with randomly striking conversations as anywhere else, so that shouldn't be your first target. There's enough to do that if you show up to a place/event that catches your interest, it's usually perfectly fine to start up conversations with people there (who are almost definitely like-minded, after all).

It's also a talking point that you're international. Expect a boatload of the same questions (""Does everyone have a gun over there?"" ""Is everyone really that religious?"" are the top two I've received), but a general healthy curiosity about life in other countries is a great ice-breaker as well, and once people start asking stereotyping questions, it's perfectly acceptable to do the same right back (I like ""Does everyone worship the Queen over here?"" and ""How do you feel being recorded while you piss?"" myself).

Buses run relatively regularly (10-15 minutes at most) between city center and the common student housing areas until midnight (very last one probably being around 12:30, I just caught one from Uni at 12:15 tonight). After that, taxis are very prevalent. Learn a number for private taxis (or add it to your phone) quick, though, as it's the difference between 3 or 4 pounds and 7 to 10 pounds from city center back to your place of residence.

Actually that story would have a lot going for it, I think, in terms of mass appeal.

It would appeal to Who fans because we'd get to see a dramatization of a segment of the Doctor's history that we can only imagine.

It would appeal to non-Who fans for various reasons:
1. Bad guys are the Daleks.  Even non-Who fans know who the Daleks are.
2. This episode in the Doctor's history is essentially an origin story for the current reboot of Doctor Who.  The audience doesn't need to know much about the Doctor's previous history because the events in this movie change him tremendously.
3. It's a tragedy with a good character arc that sets up potent motivations for the Doctor as a character.  For a movie franchise, those motivations could be tweaked from the ones in the show.  For example, his shame/guilt over destroying two races could be great fodder for following movies about him trying to discover a way to save his race or find other survivors.  This kind of story of the hero's emotional core is actually pretty necessary, I'd say, for today's Dark-Knight influenced audiences.

Also, wrt no time travel happening in this story, I think that's just wrong.  The whole nature of the war would be that it messes with time.

true,stevieglfc,null,null,"Our defense is sufficient. We need a player who's name on the team sheet will inspire the confidence that we can beat not only premier league teams, but the likes of other top European teams. 

Up top we are set. Suarez clearly has the ability to win games. Bellamy and kuyt are respectable alternative and can also play the wings; they're great squad players. We also have carroll bringing up the youth movement. 

Ignoring players like henderson who is one for the future, we have two areas of immense concern:

**The Wings**
nani, young / milner, silva, nasri, johnson / hazard, sow / pepe, vucinic / gervinho, walcott / sturridge, mata / bale, lennon / robben, ribery / ronaldo, di maria /  are on the wings of top teams.
Who do we have to compare? downing? not exactly inspiring confidence nor comparable to these players. (We do have some skilled players like kuyt and maxi who can play here but they are getting older and new players are required.)

**The Middle**
In the premier league we have arsenal who picked up arteta to go along with song and ramsey.  Chelsea have lampard, mikel, essien, ramires and our favourite hipster meireles.Tottenham, with probably the strongest midfield of the lot, picked up parker to go along with the amazing combo of modric and van der vaart. What did we get?  Adam, an inconsistent mediocre performer who’s probably good enough for the bench at most. We do have  gerrard and lucas, a respectable combo, but ol' stevie G can’t be expected to survive entire seasons worth of games and europe should that become the case. Not exactly inspiring confidence. We probably should have spent more time treating skilled creative players like aquaman better and leaving scrubs like adam to a lower to mid table team where he belongs.

TL;DR when looking to the transfer market we need to look at players worthy of a champions league competitor, not plugs.

Now, when I ask him why this fame-phobic multi-millionaire is shilling for unguents, his face creases (he’s not getting enough Lift from his Vita, clearly).

&gt;“It’s a tricky thing,” he says. “I know exactly why I’m doing it.” Pause. “What I didn’t know was whether I ought to be saying that I know why I’m doing it. They call you up and say, ‘do you want to do this thing?’ I say, ‘no, you’re out of your mind.’ Then they say a sum of money, and it’s huge. I mean, it’s verging on the wicked, really. But: for that money I could build a school in Sierra Leone. Once that thought enters your head, you cannot turn away from it.

&gt;“Because if you do, what you’re really saying is that my pose, the way I present myself, is more important than kids getting an education in Sierra Leone. Who could do that?” Laurie took the job. No, he’s not establishing an actor’s charity vanity project. Laurie is as aware as anyone of the “terrible kicking” meted out to Oprah Winfrey and Madonna for the capital projects associated with their humanitarian work. Having sought out advice from the experts at Comic Relief, he’s putting the money into a fund to be administered by the charity. 

**tl;dr He did it for the money, which he's donating to charity**

By declaring cuts upon taking office, the bond market gave us a massive swerve when it looked as if it was going to target us first before even the PIIGS came into play. Now we can borrow at record low rates and the UK is seen as a safe haven for investors, some argue safer then the US even. 

Also by and large the cuts haven't even started yet. 

What could be a master stroke is if Europe can forge some form of fiscal union in the next couple of years it might take all the sting out of the bond vigilanties tails before we have to really chop deep.

Two reasons I think that the whole argument about the 'cuts are ideological' is flaming dogs mess are that Dave 'heir to Blair' Cameron and co are not Tories of the typical mould. Look at the backbench beef brewing. I think he plan is to keep us out of the picture whilst Europe and the US takes the heat from the bond market by announcing big violent cuts whilst slowly trimming down our deficit over a few years. 

Secondly 'ideological' implies that it is in the Tories nature to cut. This train of thought Is completely negligent of fact and history and conveniently overlooks the delapidating management of our economy by labour in the 70s which saw us go cap in hand to the IMF for a bail out. When we look at Europe now we see how big a deal it is to ask for a bail out. They make u chop left right and centre.

Much of what we consider to be Thatcherism and ideological Tories is spin disguising enforced IMF cuts..

true,Pataracksbeard,null,null,"Okay, kiddies, it's story time. Circle on up and sit down criss-cross-applesauce and we'll get started.

I first heard of Doctor Who from a couple of blogs that I had been following online. The writers praised the show and often included Doctor Who stuff in their posts. I was curious, but nothing more, especially since I live in the United States and don't get BBC on my TV. 

Time went on. I graduated high school and entered college. I am a fan of Italian films and language and when I heard of an opportunity to study abroad in southern Italy for the summer, I jumped on it. In the pre-departure meetings, I met a girl who was also going on the study abroad program. She was funny, kind, beautiful, and we shared many similar interests. I wanted to ask her out, but she was in a relationship, so we became friends. She and I were both fairly introverted, so we didn't really get to know other people in our group very well. After much waiting and anticipation, we finally made it to Italy. She and I spent quite a bit of time together the first couple weeks, going to class, exploring the city, going to the beach, and soaking in the culture. After the second week, though, she gets a Facebook message from her boyfriend back in the states in which he confesses that for their entire relationship, he had been in love with another girl. She was crushed and, being her friend, I was there to comfort her. She wanted to go home early, but I convinced her to stay and to not let that dick ruin her Italian experience. After her breakup, she and I spent even more time together, and it was at this point that I started having feelings for her as more than just my friend.

Now, if you've never been to Italy or don't know much about southern European culture, then you might not be familiar with their siestas. At around 1:00 PM in the summer, all the shops close and everybody goes home for lunch and to relax during the heat of the day, until they re-open the shops around 5:00. As Americans, we were very unused to having such a large portion of the day with nothing to do. She and I would sometimes hang out together to pass this time, talking, playing cards, or watching TV shows on my or her laptop. It was during one of these siestas, as we were both sitting on her bed, that she asked me, ""Have you ever heard of the show Doctor Who?"" I replied that I had heard of it and was curious about it, but had never seen it. She exclaimed, ""REALLY! I love Doctor Who! I'm a huge fan. Do you want me to show it to you?"" And so she explained who the Doctor was and a bit about the background and we watched 'Rose' together.

To be honest, I wasn't so sure I liked it at first. There were definitely aspects that I really enjoyed, but had I watched it on my own, I doubt I would have been sold on that episode alone. But remember, kiddies, that I had a pretty big crush on this girl, and when she asked me with a smile if I wanted to watch more, and looked right at me with those big brown eyes of hers, there was no way that I could give any answer other than the affirmative. After a few more siestas of watching more episodes, I started to really like the show, and, it turns out, she started to really like me. And so it came to pass that we would watch Doctor Who together on our beds in the heat of the Italian summer, and I came to love that show, just as I unknowingly came to love that girl.

Here is the part where I wish I could say, ""And we lived happily ever after."" But this isn't fiction, and real life rarely works out the way we think or hope it will. I look back on that summer with a myriad of emotions and a heart full of lessons learnt. I will never forget that summer, that girl, or the amazing television program that she introduced to me.

Hear me out. I think Moffat can write absolutely brilliant episodes. As long as he's working on a single episode or a two-parter, he's shown that he's capable of devising fabulous new monsters and engaging plots that come to a well-thought-out, emotionally-satisfying conclusion. The fact that The Empty Child/The Doctor Dances, The Girl In The Fireplace and Blink are constantly referenced and recommended is a testament to this. It's a fact.

However, once he was put in charge of an entire season, things got a bit more... wibbly-wobbly, especially with series 6. He started off strong, with a great new alien menace - the Silence - and plenty of neat plot threads to work off of in future episodes. The hitch with this was that, unlike with a single episode, he didn't have to come up with the resolution at once and make sure everything came together neatly. It's damn near impossible to think out an entire season like that. Sure, I believe he had a strong idea of where he wanted the season to go. I believe he knew River was the one in the suit (it was pretty heavily foreshadowed that she was in prison for murdering the doctor) and I'm sure he had plenty of other ideas. The main problem though is that Moffat loves unforeseen plot twists and leaving the viewer at least a little confused until the resolution. I don't blame him for that since it can make for an engaging show, but when given a full season to work these into an overarching plot, it causes the plot to be convoluted.

In the first episode of series 6, Moffat gave himself enough rope to hang with. The Silence became unimpressive rather quickly and their actions ended up being rather unfathomable. Why did they need to train River when the suit ended up running on autopilot? His death is a 'fixed point' and surely the time-travelling Silence knew that any other assassination attempts wouldn't work. Why did they need Amy and Rory's daughter? Anyone could have been in that suit. In fact, no one could have been in that suit and it still would have shot.

I've been unimpressed with the seasons as a whole with Moffat. That isn't to say that I haven't been enjoying the show; quite the opposite, in fact. There are some really fun episodes. But I at least knew with Davies that he wasn't trying to pull a fast one on me just for the sake of pulling a fast one on me. There was logic behind his arc plots.

That being said, I'm willing to say that Moffat's the better writer. Good God do I love his episodes.",0,1321338560,null,0,false,0,c2zvuui,t3_mc5wc,t1_c2zvuui,t3_mc5wc,1427879365,8,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,8

I still owe him a pint actually.

Anyway, I took some friends to the pub after they had just got off the plane from Dublin.

Although maybe the OP's idea could work, but with a little tweaking. I always imagine the Doctor's stealing of the TARDIS was more of a magical moment. Walking into the unlocked TARDIS, grazing his hand across the console, and saying,""Marvelous...it's the most beautiful thing I've ever seen...""

Although, perhaps the OP could take a slightly different route.  Don't just have the Doctor running...give him purpose(Even if it isn't divulged in the beginning).  Show his fear as he runs about Gallifrey, and eventually stumbles upon a TARDIS junkyard. Several broken down TARDIS' are laying about, and he goes about trying desperately to get into each one. Just trying to find somewhere to hide. TARDIS after TARDIS...they're all locked. Until he comes across one that isn't.

Quickly, The Doctor stumbles inside, locks the door, and takes a moment of breath for the first time since the opening sequence.  Slowly his head catches up with his feet, and he realizes he's on the inside of a TARDIS. Never having been inside a TARDIS(Keep in mind, not every Time Lord is granted a TARDIS, and he is still young), The Doctor looks on in wonder.  He walks over to the console, and it begins to light up. The monitor reads 'Bioscan required'. As he looks down, a hand scanner comes up from the console. The Doctor slowly places his hand upon the scanner. Slowly it scans his hand...then, for awhile, nothing...

Suddenly the TARDIS whirs to life, several switches start flipping themselves, and a familiar vwoorping sound fills the TARDIS. The Doctor, at first, has a look of shock. This look quickly turns to a look of excitement as he grabs hold of the console himself, and flips switches trying to operate it.  The TARDIS vanishes, and leads into a shot of the TARDIS flying through the vortex as the opening credits and music begin playing. The opening credits continue as the actual galaxy is shown, and you can see the TARDIS flying through time and space at the same time(Portrayed by the time vortex trailing around the TARDIS as it flies through space).

Finally it lands in 1963 London where the Chameleon Circuit kicks in, and turns it into everyone's favorite blue box.

The rest of the movie would be spent not only watching the Doctor run from whatever it was at the beginning, but learning what exactly he was running from. Perhaps it could be The Master, who saw The Doctor as a threat and was having him framed for some crime. At some point The Doctor finds out that The Master has taken over the High Council, and it's up to him to return and save the day.",0,1321342002,null,0,false,0,c2zw7hj,t3_mcojg,t1_c2zw7hj,t1_c2zw463,1427879534,3,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,3

I guess the problem is that the mainstream media has the gender to make money, and most independent channels have their own more political agenda.

For instance, Counterfire are a great bunch of people who are starting up a video based TV type thing, but there's definitely a left wing bias to their stuff, because they are a left wing organisation.

I guess bias is unavoidable, and all we can hope to do is mitigate for it.

true,TheShader,mcgann,Defeated Cpt. Kirk,"I was actually thinking about that as I was coming up with my little synopsis.  There's essentially 3 different ways the writers could go about the phone box. They could either have it happen right away(As I suggested), have it happen at some point in the second act, or save it for the next movie. I think the last option is almost a none-option, just because the police phone box is so iconic. It would almost not be a Doctor Who movie without that appearance. It'd be like not using the USS Enterprise until the second new Star Trek movie.

I could go either way on the first two options, though. Despite my synopsis, I'm actually leaning closer to having it in the second act. That way you could properly have some explanation as to why the Chameleon Circuit broke. Although it really depends on where the story itself goes, and if it lends to telling how it broke, or if it's an unimportant detail and should be explained as,""That's how it was in the junkyard"".

And, like I said, the great thing about starting over like this is perspective. When the original writers wrote An Unearthly Child, they didn't know about the Daleks, the Time War, The Master, The Cybermen, etc. As iconic as An Unearthly Child is to Classic Who, in retrospect maybe it's not as important to the overall retelling.  Perhaps it even gets in the way of more important details. For example, you're 100% right. If you want to use that story as canon in what is essentially an 'origins movie', you run into one of two problems. Either you're forced to change The Doctor's origin story to include An Earthly Child, limiting your story, or you limit some of the more iconic Doctor Who items(Mainly the blue police box) as it wouldn't be able to be included until another movie.",0,1321344685,null,0,false,0,c2zwfgw,t3_mcojg,t1_c2zwfgw,t1_c2zwdga,1427879641,4,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,4

Studios like the idea of being able to go on forever if something goes well, that's why Doctor Who will look so very tempting to a studio. It's ""SciFi James Bond"". It has a British twist which US audiences love and it has an in built mechanic so that they can change the lead actor whenever the hell they like.

true,Frankeh,eng-eastsusex,South East,"Your numbers are skewed by a huge rise in property prices in recent years. We can't expect that kind of growth again for a reasonable amount of time. IIRC my parents house doubled in value in just 5 years during the boom. 

Currently, as a first time buyer with an average income, it's not worth it imo. The cost of servicing the debt @ ~4-5%, the lawyer and survey fees, and the millionandone other costs involved in moving house just doesn't make sense. 

I live in brighton as you do. I can rent a nice 1 bed flat for around £600 a month.. 

The cheapest comparable flat (Not in a tower block) is £110K. 

I'd need around 25% of that for a deposit which would be £27K (This is the biggest most devastating hurdle and possible expenditure come a property crash). Because of the reasonable LTV I could probably get a FTB mortgage of 4.5% on the remaining £82.5K which would be an annual interest payment of £3712.50 or £309. Then you've got to pay back some of the capital so bump that up to the £500 that banks seem to love for my average income level and now you're only £100 off the rental cost each month. 

As long as your house doesn't devalue and nothing goes wrong such as a boiler or white goods then you're quids in. Not in the first year, mind, because all the extra money you saved would have gone on lawyers and a survey. 

Then take into account that a flat/house can take a lot more time to sell and move out of than the 1 month notice period of a rental property and it doesn't seem like such a great deal to me.

sure, the first month, year, even 10 years doesn't look great when you look at what you're paying for debt servicing costs, but it's misrepresentative to say that there is an annual interest cost like it's a fixed amount. 

besides, you have to live somewhere - you're in it for the long haul so you may as well invest your housing cost as opposed to pay for someone else's investment. rents will rise year on year (mine rises by 5% every 3 years, which is quite good), but the mortgage will never rise. on that basis,  £600/month rent will cost £694/month in 10 years time, but a £600 mortgage will still be £600.

if the cost is comparible, why pay off someone else's mortgage?

true,bluefold,null,null,"I went to a school that regularly got 'outstanding' in ofsted inspections, it was a 'centre for excellence' in multiple subjects and based on the multi-million pound redevelopment they just had, well funded. It was shit.

During inspections the disruptive kids would magically find themselves having PE that day while the quiet ones would sit dutifully having double French. The lessons were ten minutes of learning the subject and fifty minutes of learning some new expletives as the teachers argued with the students.  They praised mediocrity and ignored exceptional students . Then because the disruptive students could not be 'trusted' (I would say 75%+ of the student body once peer pressure started taking effect) nothing interesting beyond verbatim from text books (All we pretty much ever did in Chemistry) all experiments were done by the teacher and then we recorded the results. We literaly had a class we called 'History Video Club' as the teach thought the best way of learning was to simply show you movies, American Civil War? Dances with Wolves. Russian Revolution? Anastasia ffs.

Schools have to be allowed to fail and teaching must be held at a much higher standard. My sister is currently doing a PGCE in primary education and she said that she is learning a lot but it is a shame that she wont be able to use much of it because if you don't follow what the Headteacher says and what they were taught you are going to have a hard time getting a job.

This is a terrible idea. It just comes off as arrogant that anyone thinks there is a way to rework almost 50 years of excellent stories and performances into a Full-Length Film. There are 11 different takes on the doctor and counting, how could they possibly define and cast a version of the doctor that would make the majority of fans be fine with their show getting the finger? What would the story be? Is there a definitive story to pull from? Would it be all-original? How could it possibly compete with our favorite stories from series past?

Short answer: it can't. The movie isn't being made for whovians. It's being made for the general audience who is at best passingly familiar with Doctor Who.

http://blogs.bbcworldwide.com/2011/11/15/majority-of-international-broadcasters-will-show-all-frozen-planet-episodes

&gt;There have been some assumptions in the press today about Frozen Planet, that I don’t feel are a true reflection of how the show has been sold and marketed around the world, so I wanted to provide some clarity.

&gt;The first six episodes of Frozen Planet have a clear story arc charting a year in our polar regions and are narrated by David Attenborough, who appears briefly on camera in the opening episode.  In non-English speaking countries, this out-of-shot narration is the preferred way of buying documentaries as it gives broadcasters the opportunity to voice-over in the relevant local language, without having to re-edit the programme.

&gt;The seventh and final episode of the series “Frozen Planet: On Thin Ice” is presenter-led with David Attenborough in shot. Although it is filmed by the same team and to the same production standard, this programme is necessarily different in style. Having a presenter in vision requires many broadcasters to have the programme dubbed, ultimately giving some audiences a very different experience. It is for this reason and not the content – that we market the episode separately, giving broadcasters the flexibility in how they schedule the programme.

&gt;Frozen Planet: On Thin Ice will be broadcast as with all the other programmes at 9pm primetime on BBC ONE.  This episode will be available on all BBC Worldwide’s international DVD’s.",0,1321371747,null,0,false,0,c2zyddp,t3_mcz3i,t1_c2zyddp,t3_mcz3i,1427880633,8,false,BritishTV,t5_2rzot,8

Bicycles not a useful transportation method?  I'm guessing it has been many years since you've used one.  Tell it to the millions of cycling commuters in the Netherlands, where the bicycle, not the car, is king.

Your car can transport fridges and all kinds of things, but can it use footpaths?  Can it cycle over pedestrian-width bridges?  Can it filter through miles of continuous traffic jams with ease?  Can it run without fuel?  Does your car make you fitter and healthier every time you use it?  Does using your car make traffic jams shorter, or longer?

Don't cite me on that though, we moved away from them pretty quickly so I'm 100% it was the British Socialists.

Check out James Meadway's talks on the economy, he's rather awesome. I can't seem to find them on the site at the moment though.

After our last Counterforum, which is basically a series of excellent talks and discussion sessions spanning a day, we had an experimental ""Question Time"" where we could all ask a panel of people things.

So here's some of my thoughts on what to do about transport in this country:

1) Stop insuring cars, insure people instead.  For example, I could buy insurance that allows me to drive a car up to 150bhp.  This will make it easier for people to share cars.  
2) Don't tax based on emissions, tax based on annual mileage and use emissions as a multiplier.  e.g. current low emission vehicles pay £0.10 per mile x 0, the next band pays £0.10/mile x 1 and so on)
3) Make all road users register their vehicles (that means cyclists too) use the funds *only* to improve infrastructure.  
3) Make all road users insure themselves.  
4) Stop using road tax for things that aren't related to transport.  
5) Build cycle paths everywhere, make their use mandatory.  Remove and auction off anything that parks in one. (Because crushing is wasteful)  
6) Stop taxing fuel for commercial vehicles, this makes all our goods cheaper.  
7) Build as many trams as possible in cities, put in more bus lanes where there's room and don't tax buses in any way, shape or form.",0,1321378101,null,0,false,0,c2zzbdl,t3_mcwn6,t1_c2zzbdl,t1_c2zyu0p,1427881075,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

Different incentives based on how anti-social the activity is.

In order of least antisocial to most antisocial, I would arrange these in the order pollution, theft, murder.  The current disincentives set up by the government are:

* car tax / fuel costs: disincentive to pollute via cars
* theft: fines and/or prison sentences
* murder: life imprisonment

These disincentives seem quite reasonable to me and in line with the anti-socialness of the behaviour.

While crime is at an all time low which suggests that the disincentives for theft and murder are working moderately well, pollution isn't decreasing which suggests that there are insufficient disincentives against pollution.

He admits outright in the article that he's unwilling to say anything that would make Spurs think Barcelona are interested.  Whatever he *actually* thinks about Bale's value, he's going to take a hard negotiating position because he *legitimately wants to spend less money.*

Of course, I'd be surprised if Levy lets Bale go for a penny less than the most he can get, but Bale's wishes may be a factor.  Levy might be able to get more from another team, but if Bale insists it's Barcelona or nothing that might change the situation.  That's what happened with both Sanchez and Fabregas, Rosell can't be faulted for trying it again.

You earned the narrow legal right to drive when you were granted your driving license but noone has a *moral* right to drive. You should be grateful you are allowed to do it instead of demanding to pollute the world at a lower cost. 
Note that I drive to work every day because its the most convenient thing for me. I would prefer that it was less convenient/more expensive so I would use a more sustainable method of getting to work. Ideally I would create zero waste, but every time I go to a supermarket - the co-op because it seems the least unethical of all the supermarkets - I get a new set of carrier bags that I never reuse because I am never organised enough to bring the old ones with me.

It's only visually implied and even then only by Eccleston checking his face in the mirror, something Smith doesn't do his entire first adventure (remember, he's confused when prisoner 0 impersonates him) so as long as the story is fast paced enough you can just set it between the time war and Rose with a different actor playing either 8 or 9 and have it fit canon perfectly.",0,1321389103,null,0,false,0,c3013gq,t3_mchxv,t1_c3013gq,t1_c300f4d,1427881913,1,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,1

true,TheShader,mcgann,Defeated Cpt. Kirk,"Well I think you're exaggerating the problem, if just by a little. For starters, the 1996 movie didn't kill the series. The series had been dead for about 8 years prior to the movie. The movie was an original attempt at rekickstarting the series, and was a failure as such. From what I recall, it wasn't even the movie's fault. After the movie failed to kick off with an audience that knew nothing about Doctor Who, they didn't even bother airing in Britain where the core audience for Doctor Who was. The entire project was cancelled the moment Fox didn't get the numbers they were wanting from Doctor Who in the American audience.

Secondly, I don't know what Hollywood movies you're talking about, but it can actually be very good for Sci-fi shows. Shows like Firefly and Star Trek(original) both saw a good boost from movies(Although Star Trek was a tad more successful). Remember, there was only something like 30 episodes of the original Star Trek, and it was incredibly niche. If it hadn't been for Hollywood making a string of Star Trek movies, we might not even know what it is today.

Also, Star Trek(2009) is a great example of pandering to both crowds. At least when it came out, it was greatly received by both crowds of people. Sure people have nitpicked it since, but that would happen with *any* movie, let alone a sci-fi movie(Hell, it happens with Doctor Who every damned episode).

Finally, this most likely won't hurt Doctor Who(TV).  It can go two ways. Either it'll be a bad movie, and nobody will like it(Like most video game movies), and everyone will see it as,""That non-canon movie that sucked really bad."" Or it'll be a success in the mainstream(regardless of fans like it or not), and it will open up more people to Doctor Who. Just in the same way that people who have gotten into NuWho are now exploring the world of Classic Who. Or in the same way people watch a movie based on a book, and feel compelled to go out and actually read the original book. Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory was a horrible adaptation of the original book, but you can bet its widespread appeal got tons of kids to read the actual book. I know my parents read me the book as a child because of the movie, and it's one of my favorite books now.

I mean, I wouldn't say I fully welcome the movie, or that I'd be first in line or anything. However, it's not exactly doom and gloom if the movie does come.  Hell, horrible video game adaptations have been coming out for years, and they've never had a negative impact on the source material. In fact some of those movies have fueled the sales of the video game.",0,1321395357,null,0,false,0,c3024cy,t3_md9bx,t1_c3024cy,t1_c301ypz,1427882396,3,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,3

&gt; After the movie failed to kick off with an audience that knew nothing about Doctor Who, they didn't even bother airing in Britain where the core audience for Doctor Who was.

Not true, it was a hit in England. From Wikipedia: ""However, when shown on BBC One in the United Kingdom on Monday 27 May at 8.30pm, thirteen days after its American broadcast, it received over 9 million viewers in the UK alone (the highest drama ratings in Britain for the whole week).""

&gt;Remember, there was only something like 30 episodes of the original Star Trek, and it was incredibly niche.

There are 79 episodes (80 if you count the unaired pilot) and ""Star Trek"" had become a massive hit in syndication in the late 70s with a rabid fanbase. From Wikipedia ""By 1972, ""the show that won't die"" aired in more than 100 American cities and 60 other countries, and more than 3,000 fans attended the first Star Trek convention in New York City."" I don't know if I would call that ""incredibly niche""

&gt; Also, Star Trek(2009) is a great example of pandering to both crowds. At least when it came out, it was greatly received by both crowds of people.

No it wasn't. It was a hit, it made made money, but it was not ""received by both crowds of people."" As a trekkie for over 30 years, I can certainly tell you it wasn't greatly received by me.

&gt; Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory was a horrible adaptation of the original book, but you can bet its widespread appeal got tons of kids to read the actual book.

This one is just opinion, but really? Are you dead inside? Do you hate fun?

Not reboot, but put a modern slant on it for a new audience who wouldn't have heard of the programme before. They included all of those aspects in my first paragraph above.

The TV movie was a ""stealth pilot"" to see if there was a place in the schedules for the Doctor's return. Nine million watched it in the UK, but Fox lost interest because no-one watched it in the US. When the production rights returned to the BBC, they started the new run (2005-).

More here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_Who_%281996_film%29

Many people still love the Eighth Doctor. Although I've not listened to them, the audio plays have a huge following. It's possible that had the Eighth Doctor been able to play out his story on TV he would have fared well. We'll never know.

I'm more worried about having two continuities at the same time. Unless the film version is a complete reboot (the First Doctor, again) it's going to be very hard to understand for outsiders, especially if they have the 11th Doctor (TV) and the Nth Doctor (Film) at the same time, but with different actors and back-stories.

true,reddit_bhoy,null,Let The People Sing!,"**Green Brigade Statement:**

On the 29th of October, 2000 Celtic fans came together in Glasgow’s George Square to hold a very successful and peaceful rally against the SNP’s anti-Football Bill. They listened to speakers from the Fans Against Criminalisation campaign detail how the Bill criminalises football fans and the Celtic support, and how dangerous it would be to extend the law to give even more powers to the police.

After the rally, fans then proceeded on to Celtic Park. Along the way they picked up a heavily-manned police escort, complete with helicopter. Inside the stadium there was a further show of opposition against the Offensive Behaviour at Football Bill, with over 100 supporters clubs displaying banners against the Bill and in support of Fans Against Criminalisation.

While the campaign could call on the overwhelming support of Celtic fans, Strathclyde Police clearly were not on message. Fans arriving at the stadium after the protest were greeted with a warning from a senior police officer: ‘you aren’t above the law, we are the law’. During the following 90 minutes and the fortnight since, the police have tried to prove their point. Although we are used to petty harassment from police and constantly being under video surveillance at matches, we were surprised to see a far larger than usual police presence in 111 – there were reportedly 20 officers in and around the stairwell in front of our section.

The match was pretty uneventful – goalless on the park and nothing out of the ordinary off it until the last 7 or 8 minutes of the game. Then, Strathclyde Police made their move. Hand-held cameras in place, they attempted to arrest someone within the section but many fans did not take kindly to their attempts to charge into a crowd and held off police who were pushing and shoving them. The police retreated empty-handed but after the match they again tried to apprehend someone as fans were walking out of the stadium. This time their (again, unsuccessful) attempts saw a young girl barged over and a crush was only narrowly avoided. The operation was clearly pre-planned: it was the first time in two seasons that the police have entered the rows of our section, it happened on the same day as Celtic fans held a successful demonstration against the criminalisation of our support and as we later found out, preceded a police complaint to the SPL delegate about ‘offensive chanting’. It seems that Strathclyde Police are Alex Salmond’s boot boys.

A few days after the Hibs match, reps from the Celtic Supporters Association and Celtic Trust met with Ronnie Hawthorn, Celtic’s Operations Manager, to discuss their concerns about the behaviour of the police. They requested a meeting with Eddie Smith, the match commander who had directed the police’s operation. At previous meetings with Smith (ironically enough, about safety issues), Smith told both the CSA and Trust that he welcomed dialogue with fans. Not this time, however, as Smith refused to meet the fan representatives. The CSA and Trust then wrote to his boss, Chief Superintendent Wayne Mawson, asking for a meeting. Unlike Smith, Mawson said he would be happy to meet but that he would not be willing to discuss the events of the 29th. Unsurprisingly, his offer was turned down.

Since then, Eddie Smith has made official complaints to SPL and UEFA match delegates about ‘offensive chanting’ by the Celtic support at the Hibs game and the subsequent match at home to Rennes. Smith is also the Crown’s main witness in a case against two of our members, both charged with a sectarian breach of the peace for unfurling a banner containing the word ‘huns’ (the only other witness is a member of Celtic’s security staff, himself a former police officer). The SPL and UEFA investigations prompted by his complaints will be conducted while the Scottish Parliament debates and votes on the anti-Football Bill, and will no doubt be covered at length by the media. We doubt this is a coincidence. Already, the propaganda war has begun – today the back page of Glasgow’s local rag carries, under a lurid headline, comments from a publicity-hungry QC close to the Celtic board who calls on us to be banned. It seems he has joined the ranks of the legal establishment who are determined to take a boot at our group and the wider Celtic support.

At 7 am on Friday morning, a 17 year-old fan was arrested on suspicion of a sectarian breach of the peace, and for evading arrest at the Hibs match. He spent the weekend in police cells and yesterday appeared at the Sheriff Court. After the Procurator Fiscal appealed the judge’s decision to grant bail, the young fan was remanded in custody in Polmont Young Offenders Institute until December 23rd. You haven’t misread that – that’s a 17-year-old Celtic fan locked up for allegedly singing a song that Eddie Smith finds offensive.

Celtic fans, and ourselves in particular, are under attack from the government and the police, who are determined to criminalise us for their own ends. We really appreciate the support we have had already, and we will be considering our next actions carefully over the coming days and weeks. In the meantime, we call on all Celtic fans to oppose the criminalisation of our support and to unite behind the Fans Against Criminalisation campaign.

Of course, there's also the route of never fully revealing the events of it at all, though they will likely explain what happened further at a later point. Still think it would make a pretty awesome movie, but it would also mean that new fans who come to the series because of the movie would already know all about the War, which would spoil quite a few mysteries for them. It would also make a pretty badass title. *Time War*

The arsenal game I think we made the right move. Defensive mistakes skewed the scoreline and we had the quality to win that match and it would have done us a world of good. We had what it takes to beat them at home at we should of.

The idea right now is for me to set up an Etsy shop and make these at my bindery...we don't have a ecommerce site or store front for these sorts of things since we mainly deal with libraries and universities, so it is somewhat of a learning process.

I also want to work on developing some designs to tie in with other sci-fi &amp; fantasy ""things""...Battlestar, Star Trek, etc. **Please let me know if there is anything that you think would be awesome to see**.

Once the Etsy shop is set up, it will most likely have representative images of each design and then will make them to order so that I can keep the overhead down. The turnaround time shouldn't be too long I hope, though of course this is dependent on demand. I'll update again I have more info.

I also think that theme to Matt's Doctor is dead on with his acting style. Eccleston was war-worn and bitter, struggling with overwhelming experience and emotion.

He also had some conflict and duality inside him. This really leads the way, to me, of Smith's more smooth Doctor.

The main complaint from people would be his choice to divert from the original source; I don't know how one could make an adaptation of a 500 page book without some form of abridgment. Also, to be honest, the 5th installment was too damn long to begin with. With that said, aside from Cuaron's adaptation, Yates' 4 movies were the best of the entire franchise. Rather than staying true to every painful detail, they focused more on being actual films. 

Two of the worst films were Columbus' adaptations and unsurprisingly, they almost stuck word for word to the books. They're different media and there's a right way to translate from one to another. Yates did this very effectively. He stayed true to the tone and basic story while managing to create good movies. In the end, that's all one can really ask for. 

I don't want him and/or Hollywood getting their mainstream SFX'd hands all over my precious *Doctor Who* but sensationalizing everything by saying ""Yates is awful"" is just plain cheap.

The Royal Navy wanted the F35B for their carrier groups as they believed that STOVL aircraft are much cheaper to operate from carriers, due to the lack of requirement to maintain the additional skills and equipment necessary for cats&amp;traps.

The US Marine corps will likely be getting a bargain price; aircraft only recently re-furbished and upgraded to what they have currently. They also need to cover the delays with the F35 programme against the aircraft in their existing Harrier/F18 fleet which will start reaching the end of their operational lives in 2012.

Its also far from certain that the F35 programme will be completed. There is a reasonable chance that the F35B will be cut due to budget restrictions, and a slight chance the entire project will have to be abandoned. The yanks are out of cash.

In the submitted article it says that this smoking ban *""could be counterproductive as consensus needed to be built across society before taking such as step.""*

I believe that the current mobile phone ban is just a step along that road - everyone now recognises that using mobile phones is illegal, and I wouldn't be at all surprised if we start to see TV campaigns against it (I don't watch TV, so maybe they've already started) and then harsher penalties. Currently you face 3 points + £60 fine, and *maybe* a ban and £1000 fine - I think that as consciousness of the dangers of using mobile phones widens the ""consensus"" will have people taking the matter as seriously as drink-driving and allow the introduction of mandatory driving bans.

A) I think the idea, though never expressed explicitly, was that Horus didn't know his race was going to be wiped out (can't remember if a reason is given for Sutekh being the last) and the apparatus left behind was there in case it was ever possible to reason with Sutekh and set him free to be a productive god in godly society. The Doctor points out that the Osirans were quite advanced and merciful, at least the followers of Horus were anyway.

B) Not sure why this isn't obvious, but the temporal trap plan only works if you can catch Sutekh right as he is starting his teleport (or whatever that was) journey. You wouldn't be able to push him back in or make him do anything when he is outside of that field. Dude wasn't completely omnipotent, but the idea was that he was damn close to being so. That moment only came right at the end after every effort prior to that had been focused on Sutekh not getting free at all.

If they had never started or once they are through that society functions pretty much the same, or is in fact more productive because people are wasting less time smoking.

Remove road transport. Half the food in your local shop you cant get anymore. What you can get costs at least twice as much because of the manual labour involved in farming it. If you live somewhere without a good train links you are pretty much screwed if you want to have a social life outside where you live. 

I guess trains would be better (or monopolised seeing as they are private now). And employment may be higher. 

The point is, our entire infrastructure and the way we live our lives is built around roads.

I am not excusing cars and petrol, this is why we tax the hell out of it, its why we need to move the better energy sources, and better cars, but just getting rid of them is a false comparison.

""The adverse health effects of tobacco smoke are widely recognised, and exposure to SHS is a major public health concern. In 2010, a World Health Organization (WHO) study found that around 603,000 people, including 165,000 children, die each year worldwide as a result of exposure to SHS. In the UK, an estimated 23 children and 4,000 adults die each year due to SHS.

Tobacco smoke contains 4,000 known chemicals, 69 of which are known or probable carcinogens and, when produced in enclosed spaces (eg a vehicle), exposes both smokers and non-smokers to the harmful effects of SHS. Secondhand smoke contains several major classes of known carcinogens, including benzo[a]pyrenes, aromatic amines, and tobacco-specific nitrosamines. It also contains nicotine, toxins (eg carbon monoxide and hydrogen cyanide) and irritants such as acrolein.
Secondhand smoke consists of a combination of mainstream smoke exhaled by the smoker and
side-stream smoke from the burning of tobacco products. It is well known to contribute to multiple, preventable adverse health outcomes.""

""...the Royal College of Physicians (RCP) report on passive smoking and children provided an update of the evidence which reaffirmed the association between these diseases and SHS. The report concludes that:

• living in a household where one or more people smoke more than doubles the risk of sudden infant death

• SHS increases the risk of lower respiratory tract infections in children. Smoking by the mother or household increases the risk by 60 per cent and 50 per cent respectively.

• SHS increases the risk of asthma in school aged children and is increased by 50 per cent where a member of the household smokes.

• SHS increases the risk of middle ear diseases. The risk is increased by 35 percent for household smoking and 46 per cent for smoking by the mother.

• SHS results in modest impairment of lung function in infants and children. The long term significance is unknown.

true,[deleted],null,null,"I sometimes suspect that the people who hate Donna do so because she was older and less attractive than the other companions. She looks like a regular lady. She's pretty, but not gorgeous like Amy or Martha or a girl next door hot lady like Rose was. She's a bit chubby in comparison but by no means a stationary land whale and I think she's beautiful. But by TV standards, she's not hot. And I suspect that some people just couldn't get past that. I almost guarantee that if she looked just like Amy, many of the people who hate how ""annoying"" she was would change their minds.

BUT, I might be saying this because I am a total fangirl and take internet things too personally. I will admit that Donna was pretty annoying in The Runaway Bride, and I was skeptical of her when she came back. But her camaraderie with the Doctor filled me with glee! Tate and Tennant have oodles of charisma and you can tell that they are friends in real life. As a companion, Donna got some real duds for episodes, and Midnight, one of the greatest episodes from her season, barely even featured her.

Donna yells a bit much, but she's a sassy lady and she doesn't let the Doctor condescend to her. As she gets more confidence in herself, she increasingly helps him out of bad situations and helps him be a better person, like a real best friend would do. She sticks up for herself, she's tough, and she's compassionate. Donna is one of my favorite characters--partially because she's *not* a mega-ultra-hot glamorous lady, but mostly because of her awesome relationship with the Doctor. I know many disagree and couldn't get past how loud she was, but I loved every minute of it. Her departure from the show felt like a burrito of Whedon deaths to me because of how it undermined her fantastic character development (though in The End of Time, when the Doctor says ""Did you really think I'd leave my best friend unprotected"" to the Master, I whooped with total delight).",0,1321461024,null,0,true,0,c3093z6,t3_mds4r,t1_c3093z6,t3_mds4r,1427885770,5,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,5

Also, I think people really need to start being critical of the whole idea of charity.

Philanthropy is basically capricious: why should wealthy individuals and companies get to decide how much money get spent on homelessness (Shelter), elderly issues (Help the Aged) or children's issues (NSPCC)? Remember that big companies only donate to further their own interest. Even if they can count it as a tax write-off and they're not giving to anyone else, they will only donate to charity if it meets their objectives in some way.

Advisers in Jobcentres are at risk of losing their job too. If they fail to meet the targets for getting people to do this voluntarily then they can be dismissed on performance management grounds. That's why they don't tell you it's voluntary.

A friend of mine went through a load of drama with his JSA because his advisor had marked down a job that he found and applied for as being a Jobcentre suggestion. That meant my friend had failed to find a job by himself, as per his Jobseekers Agreement, and his benefit was stopped for a time. The reason why that happened was the same reason that advisers are coercing people into voluntary placements: they have targets to hit.

true,specofdust,scot-Highlands,Pasty Faced Haggis Rider,"3.3 million, hmm. Lets say that debt was denominated in dollars, that'd equate to 10 million of debt just via inflation by this point. Now take that sum and calculate the compound interest calculated on a daily basis which would be required to take it from 3.3 + inflation + interest (x) to get to £100 million and we find that on top of inflation that's an interest rate of just under 11.4%. That's not exactly ideal, but it's not completely unreasonable for a high risk loan.

Once again, this seems like fairly standard monetary policy. You borrow a significant amount of money at high interest rates because few trust you to pay it back. You don't pay it back for 30 years, and all of a sudden you owe 10 times as much money in real terms. The same could easily happen to me if I took out a loan tomorrow, and no-one would claim that the banks were being utterly immoral by trying to collect on that debt.

Which leaves us with the war torn country issue. Now as far as I understand it countries can declare debts taken upon them by an invalid leader to be null and void (I can't recall the name for this process). However DRC doesn't appear to have done this, and as such it seems perhaps that they lack a valid claim, which seems odd to me because afaik Mobutu at this point had staged at least one coup, which would appear to mean he didn't have consent of the people. However this is fairly complex legal territory.

Regardless, the ethics of profiting from a developing country? My thought is that if we can't do business with developing countries at all (which is basically what would be required to disallow profit making) then their development is going to be hugely slowed. I can't imagine it'd be beneficial.

For the time being. As I said earlier, if you don't fix the underlying problems, it will be back and worse next time.

I certainly can't blame someone for having the good sense to not want to get hurt. I would further suggest that they probably had a pretty good idea that they could get hurt and decided against it.

What you may want to consider is that if these kids decide to get violent (and I mean towards the police) there is a pretty good chance that a lot of people are going to get hurt.

if you are receiving job seekers you are receiving payment, and prior to this scheme you would have received that money for nothing, now you get work experience, potentially a reference if you do well plus some money to live off.

please excuse my crude calculations but i think job seekers is £60.50 a week and minimum wage is £5.93 an hour. 27 hours at minimum wage is circa £160 so by taking part in this scheme you loose £100 a week.

However, if you get a good reference out of it I would personally feel that was worth a lot more than £400 (over the length of the placement) in the long term. Thats just my perception by the way, not me making a universal statement on how everyone else should feel.

I think the idea is that part of the payment is the concept of getting pride out of working which boosts your self esteem and spurs you onto taking responsibility for yourself.

I think that the devil is in the detail here. 

Part of the problem is that with this type of scheme there is less incentives for employers to hire full time when they can tap into this market...... however, this is only a problem if the scheme is continued in the long term indefinitely. if the scheme is ended in a few years then we could have a situation where we now have a generation of underemployed people who have valuable work experience and able to step straight into the work force...

Not really.

Yeah, there was that idea in the Pandorica/Big Bang episodes with the Doctor giving Rory his screwdriver to free the Doctor so that he could give Rory his screwdriver etc but that's really the only time I can think of it. [Bootstrap paradox](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bootstrap_paradox)

Christmas special was him going back in time and changing Dumbledore's past. No previous indications were there, that's straight up changing time.

In the Girl Who Waited it was some kind of crazy aborted time stream. I didn't really get when our Old Amy said she saw another older version of herself refuse to help her when she was first trapped there. Is there an Old Amy running about the universe with Doctor and Rory because different timestream Old Amy decided not to help the Old Amy we're seeing on TV? That made no sense; I chalked it up to bad writing and an idea that wasn't fully fleshed out. Loved the episode other than that though.

The whole 6th season wasn't about a bootstrap paradox like pandorica/big bang, it was just time being consistent with itself and fixed points and whatnot. Doctor found out he's going to die, wants to know why, then figures a way to get around it *without knowing prior that's how he got around it* (as far as we know). So then the Doctor was supposed to ""die"" but he didn't that time (in the season finale) which fucks up the timeline, but then he fixes it and timeline good and consistent again. It wasn't really a self-fulfilling thing, just a ""fixed point"" that he found his way out of. I guess you can argue this one as being similar to the first one, but I think it's different.

Smoking in a car, as a driver, is a distraction, exceedingly so in incidents where the ash falls off inadvertently, or even dropping the cigarette itself - people inevitably panic a little, or at least make an attempt to remedy the situation which is impossible to do without directing your attention from driving.

Just as I see people texting, or on calls with phones to their ear, or putting makeup of all kinds on, or turning to chat to their passenger, it should all be encompassed under one offence, including smoking whilst driving.

Note that I believe it ought to be legal for passengers to smoke if they wish. I think it should also be a separate offence to smoke around a child below a certain age threshold, which is one of the concerns surrounding the support for this ban of smoking in cars.

People and the law (though the law less-so now) seem to turn something of a blind eye to what is essentially passive-murder or passive-manslaughter. By driving whilst distracted, or smoking around others, you are either causing harm over time, or statistically likely to eventually cause serious harm to yourself and/or others.

Not just that, but some people just don't seem to respect life. When people start disregarding their lives and other's lives, it comes to be as no surprise that others are proposing bans like this.

Part of it is just stuff I've heard from him (like his ""oh, there's no continuity in Doctor Who"" nonsense) and part of it is that all his villains reuse the same gimmick over and over: angels- don't look away, silence- don't look away, vashta narada- can't see them, prisoner 0- blends into the environment. Everything's a sight-based gimmick. I stopped enjoying them once I realized they're all just variations of each other.

He ruined his own monster. The weeping angels were awesome in Blink, but... now they talk. Ok, that's lame, but they're still cool. And the image of an angel becomes an angel. Wait. What about that picture at the end of Blink? Nothing happened to that one. Whatever. Minor detail. Oh, also, don't look into it's eyes. ...What? You mean like they did for practically the entirety of Blink with no negative repercussions whatsoever?
 
Then there's River Song. The big one. Meeting in the wrong order? Genius. Alex Kingston? Something about her makes my eyes want to puke. I can look past that. River is annoying as all hell. I can look past that, too, I did with Donna (upon first viewing, I hated Donna, but I still enjoyed her episodes, and after watching again, I like her now). But... why is the Doctor interested in her? Only because of the out-of-order thing. She flails a gun around wherever she goes, and he's practically a pacifist. She should've been someone he would've gotten on with anyway, and the out-of-order thing just an unfortunate side-bit. Instead, the order issue is the only thing that attracts him to her. It was a great idea that got messed up by a poor character and having an entire season devoted to it.

The whole 'doctor ruins his companions and suffers guilt' isn't fun either. Really, Rose went from single-parent lame life to both parents, and a Doctor boyfriend. Donna broke even. Martha wouldn't have worked with UNIT, or met Mickey. Amy and Rory have been through hell, though. So, 2 out of 5? Hardly a basis for crippling guilt. I preferred his time war guilt; that actually made sense.   

I preferred Davies, because, even though some of his stuff kinda sucked, there was a lot of emotion in it. I think he was generally good at making the audience feel what he wanted them to. Moffat just wants to tell a story he thinks is cool. 

I really did want to like him, I mean, he wrote most of my favorite episodes for Docs 9 and 10. But he shouldn't be writing more than 2 episodes per season. He shines with single-episode stories; makes my eyes bleed when he covers a whole season.

I was totally willing to forgive him, too, at the end of this season. I figured all that 'who is river song' nonsense is out of the way, she can just be a normal side-character now, and we'll have a better 7th season.

This work experience is nothing of the sort, it is free labour - the companies get paid for taking these people.  When they have two choices - pay an employee to do a job, or, get paid by the govt to have someone work for free.. which do you think the companies go for?

What relevant skills is someone who is stacking shelves/mopping floors going to gain?

&gt; For some, that means when you take all the unemployment benefits they'll get, they earn more than someone doing 39hrs a week on minimum wage.

Bullshit, pure and simple.  

39hrs x 6.08 (min wage) = 237.12 + tax credits for low earner, average £50. = 287.12/week

Jobseekers allowance - £67.50. +  Housing Benefit, say £100, + Council Tax benefit, £15 = 182.50/week

Why not make the companies pay the difference of the salary?  If a weekly wage for a job is £237, then govt would pay JS allowance, and company makes up the rest.  The company then gets an employee for cheap, but the jobseeker is actually getting a fair wage for their work - having extra money in their hand would also show them how they are better off working than on the dole.",0,1321469492,null,0,false,0,c30agwy,t3_mefnq,t1_c30agwy,t1_c309ikh,1427886456,6,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,6

While JSA is only in the order of £60, some job seekers also claim housing benefit.

Housing benefit will cover ALL  of this; the maximum limit is based on the average LOCAL rent for suitable and adequate accommodation. So it is quite possible for a job seeker in my area to be receiving £250-300 per week.

It's never enough though, mathematically it never can be.

The employees are only employed because the business is able to sell their product for a higher price than they pay the employees to produce it. This means the employees are always paid less than the market price of what they produce, and so across the whole economy, can never afford to purchase everything that is produced at profitable prices. And so this eventually leads to recessions when companies can't sell the goods they are producing as people can't afford to buy them, and so they have to make redundancies, creating a cycle of recession and slow recovery.

&gt;If i had a company i wouldn't want these people working for me, regardless how cheap they are.

That's a fair point. Someone who has absolutely no commitment or personal investment in your company is not going to offer you the hard work and loyalty of a well paid worker. Taken in this spirit I congratulate you on your desire to pay workers in your hypothetical company a decent wage. But, it depends what your company does I guess. A Tesco shelf stacker can't really fuck up too bad and if they do I'm sure the threat of taking their benefits away and making them homeless will make them put the frozen chickens in the right place. 

It could also be that these companies are effectively *paid* to take these ""workers"". Tax breaks, publicity, or flat out ""we will take them if you give us money"". They get a fucking good deal considering their needs; even if your hypothetical company might not want them.

The second part of your statement is an odd viewpoint if you read the article.

&gt;These are the dregs, the unemployable. They would be a liability.

From the article,
&gt;Twenty-two-year-old Cait Reilly is currently completing three weeks at Poundland, working five hours a day.

&gt;Last week, Reilly, who graduated last year with a BSc in geology from Birmingham University, found herself with five other JSA claimants stacking and cleaning shelves at Poundland in south Birmingham.

Birmingham Uni is rated in the top twenty in the UK league tables. She's not going to steal your frozen chickens. She has some aspirations and ability. Perhaps not rich parents to support her through a job search though, if that's what puts you off.

That and the fact that over a million young people are unemployed... are one in five people under 25 'dregs' and 'unemployable'? Or perhaps you mean only the ones who take 'too long' to find work? The number of them is also increasing exponentially if you believe the news today- my guess is someone is fixing the definitions of 'long term' to enable them to be force fed to Tesco. That, or that there are actually less jobs around. It's not that more people are suddenly becoming dregs and unemployable- of that I'm convinced and it is where your second statement is incorrect.

true,alchemist5,pertwee,Pertwee,"&gt;IMO Moffat's two years have been the most week-in-week-out consistently good the show's been since about 1977... 

This might be true. While I don't think there's nearly as many high points as the first 4 seasons, there aren't really many low points either. The worst, I think were the angel episodes, and they would've been mostly fine, if it weren't for Blink. The worst I could say about any specific episode is ""meh.""

&gt;My personal ideal would be for Who to have an army of great writers so that you could get people like Moffat, Paul Cornell (Family of Blood), Richard Curtis (Vincent), and Neil Gaiman (Sexy) all writing one story per year. 

That would be ideal! I'd rather have 12 great, stand-alone stories than an overarching plot (I mean, I imagine most of season 6 sucked for anyone who doesn't like River, single/double episode arcs would end issues like that). 

&gt;It reminds me of the Cartmel Master Plan. If so, I think Moffat has the chops to pull that storyline off. But I hope he's not going there -- whatever the Doctor's pre-Unearthly Child history is, it can't match up to expectations and to the sense of mystery his character has.

Agreed. Except I just don't see Moffat being able to make ""Doctor who?"" sound any less awful...

I agree they've made it harder, but I see young people buying alcohol without ID in my local off licence all the time and some of them look under age to me.

The same way I know where to get some weed when I need to then kids know where to get alcohol. They'll know the dodgy off licences, easy pubs and older friends who can buy for them.

&gt; It's illegality makes it even more enticing due to kids wanting to seem like rebels.

Same as the illegality with using it when they're underage. I doubt the kids care that much if other people aren't allowed it, they care that they aren't allowed. That's what makes it enticing. I doubt legalising it for everyone except them will change that.

I'm not saying it wont prevent some kids getting high, of course it will, just like it's current legal status does. However, you can't say it's the ""only way"" to prevent them getting their hands on it. I doubt it'll make any real difference to the current way of preventing them getting their hands on it.

true,Tetzel,eng-manchester,Greater Manchester,"My work (a large company) is currently running this. We have 6 new starters (been there about 3 weeks) doing 30 hour weeks for their benefits. One has a child so gets slightly more than the 200 a month the others gets, one is a biochemistry graduate, most of the rest were made redundant from old jobs, and we have one guy who is just unemployed (but not for lack of trying.)

They're all competing for maximum two positions as temps over christmas. If they get this job their temp contracts will run out on the 31st of December. Whilst doing this unpaid work we have hired two temps to bolster numbers who are actually already working and earning a wage. The guys on benefits are hella mad.

The boss has already made it clear that the reason we're doing this as a company is to 'save hours', basically the 30 hours of work per week, per person, are hours that my boss doesn't 'spend' on regular employees. This puts him in the good books with his bosses (no hours spent = no money dished out), and it also leaves him with some extra to give to the employees who have worked there for a while over Christmas (we'll see how many of them he's actually willing to spend, however.)

I am the only person in my work who sees a real problem with this, and have unfortunately been given a condescending nickname (which backfired because i display it proudly around the workplace) as 'suffragette.' The others say 'it's not our problem' and 'it's training though, work experience so they can get jobs in the future'. My actual pleas for logic and reason (that they won't be getting jobs with schemes like this in place to exploit them) fall on deaf ears.

Kinda shitty really; they're all working their absolute arses off, especially the guy with the kid; who basically has said if he doesn't get this job he is going to be in more debt because he's wasted this month of unpaid work because he's had to pay for travel and food instead of staying at home and cooking for a lot cheaper.

Really pisses me off; they're all really excellent people and i want them all to get hired. It's not going to happen though, seems like we're set to keep one, *maybe* two people on and that's it.

Meanwhile the few men who employed at the place and the management did the square root of feck all during the day.

During the time there I felt the whole thing was a way to get people off the dole. They send people to this place, well out of the way, work them hard in shitty conditions in the hope they will get sick of it and lose their benefits. It provided no sort of opportunity to learn skills or get some sort of qualification, or even relevant experience. They threaten people with sanctions for the smallest of infringements, and mysteriously don't turn up to give people travel expenses. Personally I did it because I feel bad taking hand outs, but it was useless waste of a month for me when I already have long term employment and it stunk of a way to get as many as possible out of the dole queue.
