true,The3rdWorld,eng-essex,Essex,"you've got to ask who are these people which will screw the figures and why? and what importance do they have?  People here are talking about reforming the lords and other serious business - do they really think that this country just goes along with the first stat someone mentions without even mildly checking their own records from when they collected and collated the data?  really? we have a very vocal press (inc citizen journalism) which would leap all over something so obvious that we're talking about it before the data has even been collected,
  
The people that may misuse the figures are going to be in informal or religion based places of communication, probably facebook wall posts and ATS threads -maybe it'll be nutnuts on the news, etc -  - - they can only get away with trying to make people believe this because no one is able to inject the official figures into the debate, this then simply comes down then to a popularity contest of factoids.  People might get told that religion x is the fastest growing religion in the world and only a small % of homosexual-crypto-satanist-demon-troll-idiot-commies have ticked 'no religion' but if it's well known in the public mind that the fastest growing religion in the world is technically Jedi or even that Jedi is a hugely popular choice then that's going to do a lot more to make them question the relevance and credence of whatever point the person had to bend the stats to make.,,,
  
tl;dr - bent stats will only be useful in a debates which lack a devils advocate.  in less important debates the jedi meme is much more impressive than a dry statistic which doesn't really mean anything anyway.

&gt;An extra piece of dialogue on Bad Wolf Bay where the Doctor hands his clone a coral-like piece of the TARDIS, telling him to grow his own. When the clone Doctor protests that it takes thousands of years to grow a TARDIS, DoctorDonna provides him with a faster solution, so that Rose and the cloned Doctor can travel through space ""as it should be"". This was mentioned in The Doctor's Data section of the Doctor Who Adventures magazine, and in the 398th edition of Doctor Who Magazine, Russell T Davies states that it is perfectly fine to assume that this part of the scene did actually occur. The scene is included on the Series 4 DVD Box Set. (Also if you look closely the clone Doctor is still holding the coral piece in the actual episode.) An interesting note about this scene is that in it The Doctor says 'The Doctor. In the TARDIS. With Rose Tyler. As it should be'. This very closely resembles a line said at the end of Age of Steel by Mickey Smith ""Thats the Doctor. In the Tardis. With Rose Tyler"". Whether this is intentional or coincidental is unknown.

They do some in thematic box sets - The Davros set, the Sontaran set, The Master Reborn (the first 3 serials of the Ainley Master), and some random ones - The Space Museum and the Chase for example, for no apparent reason. For the most part however, you get four or five episodes making up a single story on dvd.

Also, bear in mind that they tend to be priced at the normal dvd release price when first released, and rarely drop drastically. Also for the longer serials, *The War Games* being the best example, it can be about £25. So you will have to fork out quite a lot of cash get all of them. You do get bonuses on all of them, they're not just boring money grabbing things like they release for the new series, but I dunno if you'd buy the dvd just for the bonuses.

Not that i'm wanting to sound like I'm trying to dissuade you, I'm just saying you should be aware.

Thus, if you've not already, I'd recommend watching them online, and then identifying the ones that you like the most, and purchasing accordingly. 
If you're in the UK, HMV sell them all. If not, then [the bbc](http://www.bbcamericashop.com/search-results.html?kword=dvds&amp;cat_id=) will probably be your best bet. They don't have them all in all the time, but you might get lucky.

true,DaveLambert,tardis,TARDIS,"You don't say which country you're in; DVD releases of Doctor Who are different around the world. But a quick look at your posting history indicates that you go to college/university at Temple, which is in Pennsylvania USA.  So I'll assume you're looking for Region 1 (North American) DVDs.  Which is perfect, I can help you with that: hi, I'm the ""news guy"" at [the TVShowsOnDVD.com website](http://www.tvshowsondvd.com/) (we've been around almost 10 years, and a few years ago TV Guide bought us).

To understand the answer, you should know a bit about how it all works.  A company called 2|entertain produces the DVDs for BBC Video.  The BBC has contracted with Warner Home Video to distribute those DVDs to retail in the USA and Canada.  A group called the Doctor Who Restoraton Team ([here's their old site](http://www.restoration-team.co.uk/)) works with 2|entertain for taking each episode of each story (for the original Doctor Who program there are multiple episodes for each story arc) and putting them in the best possible condition for the DVDs.

When the BBC first began releasing DVDs of this show 10 years ago, they couldn't even imagine putting out season sets. Since there are 159 (multi-episode) stories produced for the original 1963-1989 program, and since many of the early episodes (for the 1st and 2nd Doctors) were lost because they were [wiped/junked](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_Who_missing_episodes), and because the number of stories could [vary by season](http://www.shannonsullivan.com/drwho/tv.html), it was not practical to put out season sets.

Instead, the restoration team ""jump around"" and work on story arcs and episodes in what seems to outsiders to be a random fashion.  When the first 3 DVD releases occured in North America (on 9/11!!), they were for the 3rd Doctor (Spearhead from Space; his introduction), the 4th Doctor (Robots of Death) and the 5th Doctor (The Five Doctors). The next pair of releases were for the 5th Doctor (The Caves Of Androzani; his exit) and the 7th Doctor (Remembrance of the Daleks).  The next pair were for the 2nd Doctor (Tomb of the Cybermen) and the 4th Doctor (The Ark in Space).  The next release was actually a ""season set"", of a sort! It was a box set with the entire 16th season (or ""16th series"", as they say in the UK): The Key To Time with the 4th Doctor (stories 98-103). Then they went back to individual releases with a 1st Doctor story (The Aztecs) and a 6th Doctor story (Vengeance on Varos). As you can see, jumping around.

From the site I work for, [here is a list](http://www.tvshowsondvd.com/releaselist.cfm?ShowID=4939) of all classic Doctor Who DVD releases in Region 1 (we are ONLY a R1 site), in epsiode order.  All the release listings include links to buy the title from Amazon.com, by the way. At the bottom is a list of ""collections"".  Also, [here is the same list](http://www.tvshowsondvd.com/releaselist.cfm?ShowID=4939&amp;Sort=Date) sorted in order of release (so you can look at the bottom and see what's about to come out).  We include the 8th Doctor ""movie"" in that list, by the way.

For the newly revived program (2005-present), we keep a separate list of the DVDs (and Blu-rays), as it's generally considered to be a separate show.  And since the new show has more traditional single-episode (with sometimes a 2-part or even a 3-part story), the studio DOES release those in season sets.  Here is the list of DVD/BD releases of it [in title order](http://www.tvshowsondvd.com/releaselist.cfm?ShowID=8980) and [by release date order](http://www.tvshowsondvd.com/releaselist.cfm?ShowID=8980&amp;Sort=Date) (which is almost the same, except where the individual releases of the 10th Doctor ""specials"" come into play, and the two animated stories).

Here are a couple of links to our site for a complete look at release listings, reviews and news for [the original show](http://www.tvshowsondvd.com/shows/Doctor/4939) and [the new show](http://www.tvshowsondvd.com/shows/Doctor/8980). Keep an eye out for news that I post about upcoming releases (if you want links to JUST the news, it is [here](http://www.tvshowsondvd.com/shownews/Doctor/4939) and [here](http://www.tvshowsondvd.com/shownews/Doctor/8980))! We cover all TV shows, so you can look up the spin-offs Torchwood and Sarah Jane Adventures, if you want.

Exactly. Torchwood is what happens if you don't have any professionals on hand and all you have standing between you and annihilation is a group of (comparatively) dumb schlubs who don't *have* the luxury of a tiny, teleportation-ready space ship and fancy sonic tools.

Torchwood is fascinating to me because it offers a view of what the world would be like if the Doctor didn't pop in occasionally. It's a bunch of inexperienced apes doing the best they can, which is often *just barely* enough to keep the planet alive. That's a level of tension and (I'm tempted to say) realism that Doctor Who sometimes lacks.

Example: Children of Earth? Pretty sure the Doctor would have handled it in about ten minutes, first by parking the TARDIS on the alien ship and then by convincing them to turn around and get packing. But since I assume Ten was busy running away from the inevitable at that point, the Earthers were left to field that one on their own, with disastrous results.",0,1298742336,null,0,false,0,c1ifyo2,t3_fsvg4,t1_c1ifyo2,t1_c1if979,1426945941,2,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,2

true,[deleted],null,null,"I can't understand how such an economy wouldn't be in a constant state of depression or rapid inflation.

Because the banks only loan money at interest (they have to or they'd lose money), however since the banks effectively own the vast majority of capital reserves, almost all businesses (and even individuals) owe this interest. In order to repay this interest we rely upon there being economic growth, so that we can create more money through more loans, which can then repay the previous loans and interest.

But with no economic growth this would just create rapid inflation, as there would be no growth in the market to support the increased money supply. Meanwhile if we don't increase the money supply then we would face recessions as there wouldn't be enough money in circulation to repay the interest, and soon enough people would default and we'd have a credit collapse as we did recently.

This is really just a consequence of the huge concentration in wealth, in the hands of the private banks. Perhaps if we nationalised the banks it would be less of a problem as we could carefully loan money out, but the application of interest is still a difficulty with no growth. Or we could try to address the wealth inequality itself, but this is inherent in the current system as anyone who gets a little more money can loan it out to make much more.

I think the only way we could really run a sustainable post-growth society is to abolish the private monopoly of the Earth's land and resources and the means of production, and abolish the system of money as it is currently used, to instead share the products of society and have an equal and abundant income of credits to be redeemed for the goods and services, this would mean there is no need for banks and loans and there would also be no stock market to be subject to fluctuations and recessions.",0,1298794908,null,0,false,0,c1iiy9s,t3_ftdqv,t1_c1iiy9s,t3_ftdqv,1426947424,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

ManUre played Wednesday and hammered Wigan yesterday. Players at this level should be able to play 2 games a week.

Fact of the matter is that our top 11 is all we got. There's no depth on the bench when players get injured.

Only bright side with today's game was that Suarez showed class twice, Glen Johnson had a decent game and Cole wasn't utter garbage.

I don't think we intercepted more than a handful times in midfield, while WHU were stealing easy balls from us, even on our own half.

Losing Kelly and Meireles with injuries was not good, hope Meireles' isn't too bad.

&gt; The broadcast series overrule anything in disagreement with it.

What about when the broadcast series contradicts itself (Season 6B, UNIT timeline, the Doctor's age, etc.)?

&gt; The specials are cannon, unless hey disagree with the broadcast series.

Ergo, Dimensions in Time is canon, since it doesn't directly contradict the series. In fact, *A Fix with the Sontarans* doesn't actually *contradict* the series, nor does *Search out Space*.

What really seems to be at the heart of the matter for you is *contradictions* - but Doctor Who is a show which has long established a malleable timeline, and which features time travel and timeline modification *on a regular basis*. Its very concept means that contradiction is impossible.

There's an Eighth Doctor novel called *Unnatural History*, which goes into some detail about the regeneration process, claiming that not only does one's appearance and personality change dramatically, but so too does one's *entire timeline* undergo a violent upheaval - which does not fully resolve itself until the regeneration has stabilized. Once it does, the timeline may closely resemble it's prior state, but there are likely to be inconsistencies.

How do you personally resolve things like *Shada*? Is it canon at all? If so, which version: The Fourth Doctor version or the Eighth Doctor version? Or, do the events of *The Five Doctors* allow the Fourth Doctor version to be undone, only to require the whole thing to be re-staged during the Eighth Doctor's tenure (as his timeline never really settled down completely)?

In fact, one of the Doctor's recurring villains in the novels was a voodoo cult called ""Faction Paradox"" - they're basically made of contradictions. The first think a Faction initiate does is kill off all their ancestors, making their entire existence impossible.

There's even a Big Finish Audio Drama called Flip-Flop which takes place in two completely contradictory timelines - each of which causes the other.

In short, if you want to say ""The TV series counts, but only some of the entries in other formats count"" then you're never going to be able to state *why* and *why not* in simple terms. ""Contradiction"" isn't sufficient grounds, since contradictions exist in the TV series itself, and are part of the central premise of the show.",0,1298846462,null,0,false,0,c1ildlr,t3_ftigx,t1_c1ildlr,t1_c1ijr0b,1426948569,2,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,2

If you really think that Amy is only with Rory because she can't be with the Doctor then you're not paying attention.  

Amy was a girl who was getting married without realizing why she was doing it.  For her, it was just sort of the next thing to do.  Rory pined after her long enough, so I might as well marry him.

I mean, hell, she pretty much killed herself in ""Amy's Choice"" when she was faced with the prospect of a future without Rory.

Amy loves Rory.  And if you're referring to her constant flirtation with The Doctor or the ""you may SO kiss the bride"" line....THAT'S just Amy.  She's a HUGE flirt.  She was never depicted as anything but.  I mean, she was a Kiss-O-Gram, for christ's sake.

&gt;Among 18-24-year-olds, the proportion who were Neet had also risen to 18.1% at the end of last year, up from the previous year, according to the figures, released by the Department for Education.

&gt;The proportion of 16-18-year-olds not in education, employment and training, however, has reached its lowest level, 162,000 (8.5%) since 2005.

&gt;Last week, the youth unemployment rate reached 20.5%, its highest since comparable records began in 1992.

Surely these facts, taken together, prove that putting people through University at great cost both to themselves (debt and opportunity cost) and to the state (subsidised loans) has not been worth it as upon graduation they still fail to find work and just find themselves in a worse situation than before.

Examination of these studies reveals nothing of the sort - it is an ideological policy that is being presented as a necessary action. That is the issue here: like you said, there is nothing wrong with applying ideology, but there is something wrong when you try to mislead the public.

true,BrokenDex,null,null,"Mmm understandable. Being anti-immigration or having a natural opposition to 'outsiders' is almost a globally recognizable human trait. I say almost because there are communities that accept it openly. Anyway I don't hold it against people who are anti immigration mainly because it is a natural reaction to seeing perceived outsiders gain a larger voice within a community, that you and people you connect with had once predominantly controlled. When you allow 'outsiders' join your community (one which recognizes human rights) they are given the same rights you receive. Although I don't hold it against people for being instinctually opposed to the idea. I do feel that maintaining ones ignorance to the obvious benefits of immigration and to the culture and views of those immigrating is a non-excusable action. It is that behaviour that is encouraging rash behaviour that results it worsening a communities cohesion. My biggest issue is with governments who instead of educating the public on immigrations benefits and methods to relate with newcomers, the government starts to hold a more anti-immigration stance to take advantage of the large amount of voters to whom this issue is held high on their list(mainly because it's easy to blame issues on new comers). Although I do recognize the need for new laws to govern the alternative new traditions that don't adhere to the basic human rights and laws previously respected and enacted by that community.

At the moment, those of us on the left are in deep shit. The Labour party abandoned us a long time ago, right now they are a spent force. There is no cavalry coming to rescue us from the tory revolution. Whatever you want to believe, the tories have the reins, and are likely to hang on to them for a long time. The last tory govt lasted 18 years remember. Once it finally went, it took them 13 years, and some exceptional circumstances, to get back in power. Apply that thinking to Labour. It's a scary thought.

I think the left has to accept that it is undergoing probably the biggest ever roll back of its ideas and policies ever. A lot of the good things achieved in the last 60 years, maybe even longer, are getting thrown away.

At a time like this, I question the usefulness of getting into pointless arguments with people on Reddit. It's a waste of energy, you end up arguing about the fine details of some theory that has bugger all to do with what is actually happening.

I'm as guilty of timewasting and venting on here as anyone, so you can take what I say with a bucketload of salt. But what I am thinking is that the left has to accept its defeat, has to ditch a lot of crap ideas, and to a large extent has to go back to basics and start rebuilding. Some of this will be done online, sure. But the bulk, and the hardest work, will be done locally, face to face, in our communities and our workplaces. We are going to have to fight, not by demonising the tories in grand sweeps of rhetoric, but by getting down to the tough job of defending our services at the lowest levels. If the tories want a big society, we have to grab it, and show that it is the people who make that work, rather than let it all be sold off while we fight trolls on Reddit.

Please don't take this personally, I am just trying to articulate some thoughts here, which apply as much to myself as to anyone else. I am still trying to get to grips with what is happening too. But I saw you had made a lot of comments this morning, and I thought - what if you had spent that time and energy on something in the real world, don't you think that might have made a real difference? Small, yes. Almost undetectable, yes. But the only way to make a change is in small, boring actions, done over and over until hopefully one day they achieve momentum.

I'm going to try and practice what I preach, to get involved in real work, with real people, in the real world. I doubt it will make much of a difference, but I think it is better than raging online.

Deposit requirements differ among landlords. In my experience they require a bank account for monthly money transfers. 

If you're here for a few months it's probably not worth it to invest in a good bike. Just buy a used one from [gumtree](http://cambridge.gumtree.com/) or ebay. I don't think it makes sense to be renting a bike for so long. Renting isn't cheap. 

For the weather I suggest you look at some averages online. I don't know what part of France you're from but compared to the rest of England, Cambridge is considered relatively dry, but don't expect long stretches of sunshine. 

Anything else you should know? There's plenty to do here, depending on your interests. Most university clubs accept non-students as members so you might want to see what's available.

its unreliability is likely to be either
-cheap/crap modem.
-crap phoneline wiring (or interference from nearby electricals, poor internal wiring etc).
-shit phone exchange/overloaded etc.

none of these are in the control of Sky, so changing provider may not help. I would seriously consider making sure there's a decent DSL modem in place first of all, as this can potentially solve a lot of problems.
Generally the free ones are awful -  the best but expensive option would be a draytek, but netgear or linksys should be fine as long as you don't go down the budget route. I would personally spend at least £50 on one.

You should also use the BT test socket to make sure its not a problem with the wiring in their house. It's dead easy to do , you undo two screws and pull a small cover off - see http://www.kitz.co.uk/adsl/socket.htm for more details.

Firstly, it forces people to have an 'order of preference' for the parties they'd vote for. Most of the electorate only know who they want in power and who they don't and they're ambivalent about the other parties. With the numbering system, people are likely to choose parties they don't really know about as their second, third, fourth and fifth choices. This is only made worse by the fact that a sixth vote is measured with exactly the weight as a first or second vote.

Secondly, vote counting is already rushed and probably error prone. The AV will only make these errors several times worse. This might seem petty, but *a lot* of the time, the vote margin is around very small.

Thirdly, it will be far more expensive that the YES group would have you believe. Educating people, especially the elderly about how the new system works is bound to cost money as well as the added expense of more ballot counting.

Or, if you think that really one of the smaller parties has the answer but you cant believe that they would know how to govern if elected, or that they would face the hard realities of government, you can put them second and still make that feeling count for something.

If so many of us only care about who we like, or even who we like and who we hate, it doesn't seem likely that the low votes will count, because a winner will appear before they even get considered.  So if we as a country tend to be on the side of social liberty, maybe red+yellow will beat blue by the second or third rollup.

The size of the figures we're bandying around in departmental spending - the figures that actually seem significant - are in the billions.  Millions are in the 'meh' category these days.

So far none of the parties have a viable solution for what's going on. Classical economics implies we're going to end up in a bad place. Keynesian thinking would only increase our deficit and be equally as risky if we don't see growth. We have increasing inflation and unemployment, if we don't increase interest rates then eventually we're going to see problems, and if we DO increase it then we might see even worse unemployment and potentially bad aftershocks.

I equally am sick of hearing about the cuts as if they're Labours fault. The cuts are ideologically no better than lending more to try spend our way out of it, both if they go wrong would lead to bad things. That's economics for you, and the Tories have done a great job of convincing the country that there's only one option and one party to blame.

I'm not an expert on how the elections work since last May was my first time voting anywhere ever, but in France you vote for who you want to be President of the nation, and not who you want as a local MP (well you do, but later...)  
There are two votes. The first one is for everyone and anyone (politicians but also whores or mailmans) and then the second vote you can only chose between the two that had the most votes. Does that make sense?

What happened was not many people bothered voting in the first round but then they all had a kick up the arse when they saw that the leader of the far-right party almost became president.  
  
I know this isn't very thorough or fantastically explained but hopefully it's given you an idea.

true,Axius,uk,United Kingdom,"It's a huge problem for me, I support AV but not under the current party system.

AV will only work if the big parties split up into smaller parties. Labour will almost certainly never be in a coalition with the Tories. In this instance, it means that coalitions will always be up to the Lib Dems, which will utterly undermine the democratic system, as the Lib Dems can take whatever offer sounds best to them and lock the other party out of power.

A feasible way to fix this would be to have 'factions' within a party standing for separate election. This would probably destabilise parties, but that's not a huge issue, and it would add at least SOME choice to elections, although it would incur significant costs for all parties involved.

At present, I'm torn between supporting it or opposing it, since supporting it will push the Lib Dems into a kingmaker role every election, and that is not what I want. The issue of electoral system has come up because elections do not represent the country adequately. Making one party decide is no more democratic than FPTP.

Like I said after the win over Chelsea, they can't be complacent going into the next match, especially when its a team in the relegation zone. The same thing happened this week. Liverpool advanced in the Europa League, and they came back to play a team in the relegation zone, and lost.

Until the season is over and you've achieved what you've wanted, THEN you can relax and become complacent, but you can never be complacent mid-season all because you're playing a team at the opposite end of the table, and the odds are in your favor.

If your JD will translate to an equivalent British degree in Law then you will need to undertake a Legal Practice Course which takes about a year. I am not sure on the cost, but I recall my friends taking out professional loans in the region of £10,000, whether this was all for fees I am not sure. This is to be a solicitor, the barrister course takes the same time but I think is more expensive.

After which you will need to do a two year training contract (for a solicitor) before you can fully practice law. I would estimate that less than half of people who do the Legal Practice Course are able to get to this stage, don't let this put you off, a lot of law students progress onto the Legal Practice Course, regardless of their quality, if you are genuinely talented this will be less of an issue.

The bulk of ex law students will do some kind of paralegal work on finishing the course as training contracts are sparse and come up all year round and not just at the end of the course, however if at the same firm then any time (up to a year) spent as a paralegal will count towards the two year traineeship.

You are better getting advice off someone who has actually gone down this path though, rather than my second hand accounts.
