Our finishing looked a bit tentative at times, the defense had a couple of scary moments too. 'Arry is still stuck on playing a 4-4-2 despite the fact that that system doesn't work for our best player. Gio hasn't been given a real chance yet this season, I'd like for us to give it another shot before shipping him away for good. He's still young and has loads of potential and could potentially be the right sided goal threat we need to pull off a 4-2-3-1. Also, Bale cannot play on the right. We saw this in the Wales game and we saw it again against Wolves. Leave him on the left, he's much stronger there.

What we're doing right:

The Return of the King: Ledley's back. I don't need to say any more on this.

BAE is still BAE.

Walker is faaaast, and looked pretty solid. Hoping to see him give Charlie some competition.

Our new signings are contributing immediately. Friedel made some clutch saves, Bad Ade scored and generally looked fantastic offensively, and Parker was a beast in the midfield and provided a pretty nice assist.

Modric might be cranky, but he's still playing like Modric, which is all I ask of him right now.

VdV is supposedly back. Let's see if he can strike up a good understanding with Ade.

Gio got some playing time! It was a couple of minutes, but hey, it's a start...right? Hopefully?

true,DrunkenTypist,eng-devon,The Mild West,"&gt;The point is, is the reason why Osborne twisted arms to get Coulson into Downing Street related to Coulson soft-peddling this story?

Why would it? It has been suggested by Ms Rowe's lawyer that the NoTW editorial went 'softly' on Osborne thus putting Osborne in Coulson's debt. An editorial saying that people behind Cameron's leadership campaign were ex-cocaine users is going softly? 

She says that she only phoned the Mirror. You know that these stories are touted round all the red tops looking for the best bidder? Frankly if you are going to sell that kind of story the NoTW and the Sunday Mirror are precisely who you would want in a bidding war.

She has decided to sue alleging that her phone was hacked - so have hundreds of others and she is at the very least a bit slow out of the starting gate. I know she is in Australia but even so...

This really is Westminster village gossip, no more and no less, and the fact that people think it is so important is that a) the Osborne hatred and b) it is not like the Official Opposition is saying a great deal about anything at the moment.

true,Ashiro,cnty-england,England,"Man up. No seriously, hear me out.

I've got 4 stories to back me up here:

1. My ex-step-dad was in his 70's when he quit. He'd been smoking since his late teens when he was in the RAF. He'd 'tried' quitting 6-7 times in the past. You know how he managed it cold turkey the final time? Our neighbour put his price up on the contraband fags by 10p and he took umbrage. Being a proud man he thought: ""well sod him - I'll just quit"". And PING - quit. Never smoked another fag ever. 

2. My mum smoked for a good 25yrs before she quit. She decided to quit because she felt stupid that my step-dad could quit but she couldn't. So to prove a point she quit cold turkey too. She'd also tried and failed numerous times in the past. Using patches, gum, Zyban, etc.

3. Me - I've never considered myself a smoker and still don't. However, at uni I got into a habit of smoking every night I went out for a drink. At uni - I was out every night! I started on 10-pack each night. Then weekends when clubbing it was a 20-pack. For months. I eventually started smoking a few in the morning. Because I never thought of myself as a smoker I never really associated my shitty moods on off days with lack of fags. I did eventually realise - 'Oh hang on. Maybe I'm craving a fag. Oops - well fuck that then!'. So just stopped smoking - just like that.

4. My Chinese friend at college got into smoking and at the time I was quite anti-smoking. In China they didn't have the huge stigma over smoking (or so he said) so when I insisted on telling him he'll get addicted and it'll ruin his health he didn't know what I was on about. I even showed him ""addiction"" in his little Chinese-English translator. He rubbished it. Thoguht it was silly. Eventually his dad back home caught wind of it and told him to stop. He did - he told me after a week that maybe I had a point about this ""addiction"" thing cos he wanted a fag once or twice. But cos his dad told him to stop he did. COld turkey - no issues, no arguments.

So what's my point? My point is there's nothing special about any of these people or stories. There's no magic bullet to quitting. 

Although addiction is definately real I think most of its power lies in its use as an excuse. You feel shitty - I must need a fag. You're hungry - I must need a fag. 'I need a fag' - no you don't.

Every smoker I've met who's said they are going to quit: I can tell within 5mins of them saying it whether they'll do it. The ones who fail are the ones who aren't entirely convinced they want to quit. They'll then over-hype how much they crave a fag. Like they're letting everyone know that when they fail - they really tried. Bullshit. Their complaints about cravings were nothing more than psychological PR. 

Its about making that concrete decision. A decision can't be overidden. You know yourself - deep down - whether you want to or not. Don't even bother trying until you're 100% committed to it. When you are committed 100% you won't even have a second thought about patches, gum, drugs, etc.",0,1315851178,null,0,false,0,c2jc5ui,t3_kd0jt,t1_c2jc5ui,t3_kd0jt,1427590873,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

I personally don't like him because he's crap at characterization and I feel he especially does his female characters a huge disservice. I also dislike him because while he has fantastic ideas and concepts, he seems more interested in forwarding his ideas and concepts and scaring people more than he's interested in telling a story. 

He also reuses elements to a very irritating degree. I loved the Weeping Angels in Blink, but hated how he retconed that episode by saying they were weak and trapped on earth. Have you noticed how often the 51st century pops up in Moffat's writing? Or how, in his one off episodes during RTD, there was always a catchy phrase (Are you my mummy? Don't blink. Donna Noble has been saved). I'm not saying that I didn't enjoy those episodes and the phrases, but he uses the same elements over and over and for a writer as clever as Moffat, it bothers me that he's always reusing his material, like it's a writer masturbatory device. There was also the line in Girl in the Fireplace, ""You're Mr Thick Thick Thickity Thick Face from Thicktown, Thickania"" that was nearly directly taken from a line in Coupling, ""Slim, slim, slimmity-slim from Slimtown, Slimania.""

I could honestly go all day on reasons I don't like Steven Moffat, but I have been enjoying series 6 and I think he's managed to find a groove that fits him well. I still wish some of the episodes in series 5 and 6 could be more like the light hearted, silly and fun episodes in RTD's era, as I think the constant serious and scary episodes we've been getting are a bit overwhelming.

true,strolls,null,null,"Stay in a London hostel, pay weekly. You'll pay maybe £80 a week (used to be £60 - £70 10 years ago) for a bed in a dorm with 3 - 10 other people.

I used The Dover Castle Hostel in SE1 for a few weeks (and another in Earls Court for several months), and it's probably changed a lot in the last 10 years - that's the nature of hostels. But the owner used to have flat-shares to rent which were even cheaper than the hostel itself. Nevertheless, stay in a hostel to start with and you will meet loads of other people in the same position, helping you with leads and looking for jobs generally (and also the social life is awesome). 

I'm a litte sceptical of the debbie-downer comments here. Things have undoubtedly changed in the last 10 years, and the economy is poorer, but there *always* used to be work to be found in London. I used to work for a courier company, and we had loads of Eastern Europeans and illegals working for us. Because you can work legally in the UK you have some advantage.

Yes, there's youth unemployment in the UK, but many of those people aren't looking for jobs, or not doing so very enthusiastically. At some point you stand on your own merits - if you're personable and confident and competent that's worth something against all the locals who aren't.

You could easily find 1000 pubs in central London, walk around all of them asking if they need any bar staff. How long would that take you? Probably a good couple of weeks, but are the odds really below 1000:1 of getting hired? Add in restaurants looking for waiting staff, and you might just happen to find a boss who's just sacked someone, who's short-handed and who'll give you a chance.

Personally, I admire your gumption in getting on with it and giving it a go. You will never regret following your dreams, only (on your deathbed) the opportunities you did *not* seize. Is it any worse being broke and homeless in London than it is in Vilnius?

It used to be that there were always jobs on the cycle-courier circuits, especially this time of year with students going back to uni and the winter approaching. You'll get really lost at first (buy a [9"" to 1-mile central London A-Z](http://www.a-zmaps.co.uk/?nid=31&amp;iid=8105)) but most people can learn (if you can make it past your first week on a pedal bike you'll be ok). Courier companies would obviously prefer someone experienced or who knows London, but in my day most all circuits had one or two inexperienced riders, because that's where the experienced riders come from. Walk around all of them, ask, if you get a job then you can go out and buy a secondhand piece-of-shit bike and start the next day; make sure you tell them you've been thrown out by your parents, so you're serious about doing cycle couriering for the next 1 - 3 years at least. Get chatting to any couriers you see sitting at the side of the road drinking coffee, ask them if their company is looking for any riders at the moment. Ask them if they can radio their controller and ask for you.

Can you fix computers? If so, 1000 fliers printed on A5 paper shouldn't cost too much to have printed - I can get 10,000 on card in two-colout printed for £400. *""GOT A PC PROBLEM? I'll fix it fast!""* Add a picture of a cartoon robot holding a spanner and you're good to go - pay-as-you go mobile phone SIM and make sure your number is on the flier! Job's a good' un. 1000 fliers posted over a weekend will get you 5 customers in the first week. Start in Kensington and Chelsea (SW3, W8, SW5, SW6 postcodes in that order), then start leafleting Notting Hill (W11) and Central London (W1, WC1, W2). If you're any good at the job (but don't try and bullshit it if you're not) then you should be charging £80 per hour in these areas. When someone calls, ask them first to describe the problem, tell them you can fix it and ask when they'd like you to pop around and fix it. In these areas, if they don't ask the price then they don't care how much it costs.

I wanted to be an English major for most of my life (until I actually got to college and it turned out that all the other subjects were really fascinating, too!) and I'm just kind of tuned to themes and developments and all those things that make up the human existence.

Steven Moffat is an uninspired, trope-reliant, plot-recycling, fanfiction writer who gets to make his little fantasies into ""reality"" as the head writer. Watching season 5 and, more prominently, season 6, was certainly enjoyable. I'll give him this: he knows how to entertain. But besides from enjoyability, it was like I was honestly watching someone's made-for-tv Doctor Who fanfiction. It's mostly River Song; she's the fanfiction's main character. Just look at her description! She's the daughter of the Doctor's companion-bffs, kidnapped and turned assassin, creating a romance with the Doctor backwards, sideways throughout time and space, only to die when he first meets her.

IT'S A FANFICTION. 

Albeit an interesting one.

Steven Moffat writes and acts like he's brilliant and elusive, but I've seen all the turns coming. I knew River was Amy's daughter before the sixth season started *because it's a trope that's been used before*.

I don't feel he's original, I don't feel he's deviously brilliant, and I think he's a jerk for writing irresolvable plots that conveniently get resolved through wibbling and wobbling. He writes cop-outs and expects it to be a huge revelation, when it's really just falling flat on its face because you know from the beginning that he'll never *truly* write an impossible situation like Davies did with Rose.",0,1315857711,null,0,false,0,c2jd3s5,t3_kd0r8,t1_c2jd3s5,t3_kd0r8,1427591305,11,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,11

Which in turn caused much, much despair. I believe that when someone combines such deep love with despair it makes a perfect emotional scene that really shows what true love is.

That's why I loved this episode because it brought that sadness, yet true show of love. 

This episode also brought out a darker and more awkward feeling doctor because it also made him feel a bit of despair for the older amy, and yet he knew all along that he wouldn't be able to bring her into the TARDIS. This made him try to block out this older amy and he tried to convince rory to do the same, but he wouldn't. That's where the true love came in.

true,BouncingLlama,cnty-uk,Around,"The tl;dr of the below is: it's a massive gamble and, unless you really have no other option, most likely a terrible choice.

Homelessness is shit, especially with winter approaching. If you have anarchistic leanings you can look for and perhaps get in touch with a ""social centre"". They might be able to help you out at least as far as squat accommodation goes, but don't expect that to be comfortable or particularly safe. If you're *really* lucky [WWOOFing](http://www.wwoof.org.uk/) might be an option, but a month probably isn't enough to sort that out and places are in rather short supply this time of year.

You will not find a flat or even a house share which will let you move in without a job or without at least being on benefits (which you won't be entitled to for at least a year after arriving here). Speaking of which, you also won't have a ""right to reside"" in the UK for that time unless you have a job, so your concern about being deported is well founded. Hostels are your most likely option, since they usually let you skip the deposit, but on the flip side the instant you can't pay rent you're out.

If you have friends here (actual friends, people you personally know, not random strangers you met on the internet) who can put you up for at least a month or two, things are a bit different since that'll give you time to find your feet, but it's still far *far* from a safe bet.

Finding a job would be more than tough. Youth unemployment, as others have mentioned, is high already. Your best bet in that regard are temp agencies, but work from them is very fickle. I'm guessing you won't have any transportation when you get here, so that puts some further serious limits on what you can do since a lot of casual jobs are in out-of-town industrial estates.

There's also another juicy conundrum: your best chance of finding *some* work is in one of the larger cities, but the larger the city, the more expensive it'll be to live there. Rurally, your money might last you a bit longer, but your chances of finding a job will be near zero. To make matters worse, unless you can get a full day's work, commuting by public transport may well eat half or more of what you'd earn.

It might take a few years, but I'd follow anomic's advice: save up some more, even if it takes a few years, and do some research first or else you'll be left broke after a month with even fewer options than you have now.",0,1315860188,null,0,false,0,c2jdgrh,t3_kdba4,t1_c2jdgrh,t3_kdba4,1427591483,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

Uh, what? You mean to tell me that Britain today is more divided, dysfuctional and regressive today than it was in the years directly preceeding and around 1981? 

You're suggesting 2011 is more unproductive then Britain was under [the three day week](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-Day_Week) and the [Winter of Discontent](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winter_of_Discontent)? Our unemployment rate today is 7.8% compared to 12.5% in 1982.

You're suggesting the Britain of 2011 is more divided and regressive than the 80s, when [Section 28](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Section_28) was introduced back then, but lifted in the early 00s and now gay people can get civil partnerships? That the sort of casual sexism and racism that went on in the workplace back in the day are in no way tolerated now?

Turns out, I find his flaws more noticeable - with Let's Kill Hitler being ultimate proof of that.

 I mean he has these huge potential story lines that are just terribly unsatisfying in their grand ""conclusions"".

The Tardis exploding? Still don't know what caused that, and it's been sort of pushed aside up to the point it's almost irrelevant now.

The huge emotional issue of Amy &amp; Rory losing their baby? Oh, we'll quickly patch it up by having her retroactively latch onto their timestream as a friend, so they ""kinda"" raised her. Big emotional arc closed!

FYI - This is from the Brilliant Book 2011 and the list is actually attributed to the Dream Lord.  

Here's the preamble from the page:
&gt; Hello - it's the spooky old Dream Lord here, come to freak you out because that's just the sort of 'guy' I am. Being the hidden darker side of that lovable planet-saving scamp the Doctor, I have to amuse myself somehow when he's off somewhere being ever-so-cute. And, specially for all your Doctor-spotters out there, who love him and his ethically dubious crusade throughout all time and space, I've prepared - you might even say 'concocted' - a miscellany of misdirection.  Concealed within the following statements are a smattering of truths about what's to come for our intrepid amigo on his Saturday night sorties on BBC1 in 2011. (I'll be watching the darker side - ITV. At least I will when the transmissions reach my poor stranded, pollinated form.) Everything else is a load of codswallop - fabrication - farrago - dream, geddit?! Try to keep up. And don't pretend you won't be poring over this page for the next few months pondering my fiendish fibs. Remember - once you read it, you can't unread it. Ta-ta! (For now.)

david mitchell and clive anderson have RP accents. they are associated with the middle and upper classes of southern England but can be found in the middle classes all over the country (it is basically a private school accent)

andy hamilton and mark steele have working class london accents which you might associate with tradesmen etc. it would be pretty difficult for them to sound formal.

arthur smith has a gravelly cockney (east london) accent which is very 'cor-blimey'. he basically has an accent you would associate with a victorian chimney sweep and again is pretty uncommon to hear on the TV (except for on eastenders). i'd say all the working class london accents make people sound a tad untrustworthy, probably because london is an intimidating place for many non-londoners.

vic reeves has a yorkshire accent. in general, anyone with an accent that is not RP (received pronunciation) or south-east accent is often perceived as slow or lower class.

true,edsballs,null,null,"To start off I would like to say that this post is by no means a defence of bankers. However, I think that there are some important points to consider before commenting on the bank ring fencing. I think a lot of media reporting is deliberately misleading to support a political viewpoint. I will do my humble utmost to highlight a few of these points and present an evaluation on the primary issue.

I myself have worked in banking and investment but never in an institution which has been at threat or bailed out. I have since left and work independently as a consultant in the industry.

I have a professional interest in understanding what happened in 07/08 but it is not a vested interest by any means.

The first thing that needs to be recognised is that the Banks f'd up. no denying it.

Some bankers were criminals, 
Some bankers were greedy,
Some bankers were ignorant.

In the UK, on reflection, I would say that our bankers were greedy and ignorant and that the criminals in the whole issue are by and large in the US. I would suspect that there was secondary Market participation by European banks in the sub-prime business but by no means on a primary scale as in the US.

It is important to realise that in all trades there is always a counter party. There is never just one person involved in a trade. There is always on the other side. In this context, I suspect that just blaming Bankers is to fall for the propaganda and let at least 50% of those accountable off the hook.

When we look back and think about the UKs housing bubble it is important we go back and look to the starter pistol so we can really appreciate what happened. It infact ties in very nicely with the current mess our governments finances are in.

When New Labour came into power, the first thing Gordon Brown did was to grant independence to the Bank of England. That is the line that is trotted out to the masses. It sounds good too. What really happened was that he granted the BOE independence in rate setting so long as they were pegged to CPI. Meanwhile, public sector finances were pegged to the higher RPI rate. Brown also took away the centuries old role of the BOE in regulating the financial industry in the UK. That was given to the newly formed and teething FSA. What was the end result... an era of cheap credit and bloated government balance sheets with completely ineffective and disjointed regulation.

Anyhow, now that we have set the scene, back to the banks. Considering the above, it is easy to see how the housing bubble got so out of control. However, this is where it gets interesting.

The popular consensus is that retail banking is under threat from greedy investment banking. 

In the case of RBS, I would say that is largely truth. They went under because they bought ABN AMRO who itself had exposure to the US sub-prime. Fred the shred was and is a mug. I recall at the time Barclays were put off buying ABN due to concerns over a lack of transparency on it's balance sheet. It's exposure to Asia was very attractive which is why Fred was so bullish, but it was it's OTC exposure to the US which dragged it and RBS down. (on a sematical side note of no real value, it should be noted that sub prime mortgage derivatives are based upon retail banking products)

Elsewhere, it was retail banking which did the damage in the UK. Northern Rock was the first to go followed by Halifax Bank of Scotland. Their demise came from aggressive expansion by offering ridiculous 0% LTV mortgages to morons funded by borrowing cheap credit in the short term debt market. Also due to poor FSA regulation, a lot of these mortgage brokers were commission fuelled so they only had short term incentives... obviously corners were cut when signing people up. It should be noted that these companies are NOT investment banks, they are by and large, mortgage providers or retail banks. Lloyds are often derided and named alongside the failed banks but it should be noted that they only agreed to taking over HBOS after Brown put a shotgun to their heads. Prior to the shotgun marriage, the centuries old boring bastions of responsible lending Lloyds were pretty secure.

Another side point to be noted here is the locations of these institutions. The City of London's name has been dragged through the mud repeatedly. However, RBS and BOS are Scottish institutions. Halifax is based in Yorkshire and Northern Trust is in the North East of England. 

Whilst not a Tory myself it is interesting to note how the blame has been placed on a typically Tory supporting region, when all of the failures came from companies head quartered in Labour strongholds.

When the US subprime crisis hit and credit dried up, the tide of liquidity went out and all of the skinny dippers were exposed. 

One thing which I will never understand is how Barclays has become such a focal point for anti banker rhetoric. Barclays was exposed to areas of the sub prime market but had a strong enough balance sheet to sell assets, raise capital independently and avoid a bailout. Surely, this is a perfect example of skilled management... Being able to cover your liabilities whilst keeping the company solvent and growing. HSBC was in a very similar situation and had to raise a lot of money but were able to do so without facing the wrath of the public.

Anyway, getting back to the point of my post... Looking back at the above information, what can we deduce...

1) The conditions for the housing bubble were created through political interference in rate setting and regulation.

2) The main culprits were based overseas, Scotland, Yorkshire and the North East... not LONDON.

3) In the UK, said culprits were largely RETAIL Banks and mortgage providers... Not INVESTMENT Banks. The difference might seem trivial but is of pivotal significance.

Now, appreciating the information we have above, a key question should be, do retail banks need protecting from investment banks or vice versa?

I think ring fencing is a cute idea which might work in theory, but the theoretical tripe that comes out of the mouths of politicians and commentators like Milliband and Peston is often far detached from reality and an inverse reflection of what the hell just happened.

However, rather than dismantle one of our last few world leading industries we still have... We could take a tiered approach;

1) deposit only - customer pays an annual deposit fee and said deposit is kept there at zero interest and zero risk.

2) retail lending only - small annual deposit fee which collects small interest.

3) investment lending - free account which is deployed into the capital markets and collects a healthy interest rate.

To continue the conversation (although I do like all of the new series), I would say that 9,10,11 have more of a penchant for using the sonic screwdriver to fix many problems.  Especially compared to the Classic Doctors who because of the absence of the sonic screwdriver -for the most part- required the writers of the series to think of a way for the Doctor to get out of situations that at times included more science (or pseudo-science) into the show.  I don't mind that they do this because sometimes it helps quicken the pace of things, but at times it can be an easy way out. 

I'd also say a comparison of the First Doctor to practically any other Doctor would be a challenge since a major restriction of the First was the actor's age and diminishing health.  Though Hartnell was an incredible actor who actually included the side effects of his diminishing health into the character, his aloof forgetfulness. But much has changed since the First Doctor's more historically-set stories and while I guess I throwback storytelling episode might be nice, it would also likely be very jarring to many of the people who aren't familiar with it",0,1315867302,null,0,false,0,c2jehak,t3_kcs4o,t1_c2jehak,t1_c2j88ws,1427591956,1,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,1

Overall he is a fantastic writer but he has no understanding of the theoretical science that goes into Doctor Who and this is something that Davies was so good at. 

As far as his writing in the more recent episodes. He seems to take huge story lines and wrap them up like in LKH, River is dead set on killing the doctor but something he says completely changes her mind to the point that she is pure good?  That makes no sense and proves that he shouldn't be at the helm of what was once a great show.

Maybe its because this particular kind of story has been touched upon so many times in so many different pieces of media that it didn't impact me at all. In every other piece like this the ending of the character who lived that horrible time line is at peace because now they will have never had that problem (hell they even did it with DONNA NOBLE!!!! DOES NO ONE REMEMBER THAT?)

Amy died, but she didn't in a way. That old Amy never happened. Time is rewritten and I cannot feel bad for a version of a character that never existed, She ceased to exist the moment they rescued Amy. None of those events ever happened. Amy will never experience those things. On top of it, this version of Amy wasn't Rory's Amy either. She was Amy, but 36 years had changed her into a cruel person, this was not who Rory married. She was a completely different woman. His regular time Amy was his Amy, only a week had passed for her, she was still who he married. The Old Amy now never existed. 

When Amy and Rory were running around on the tardis in the Doctors wife, and Amy kept seeing Rory age and grow old, become bitter, angry, and hateful, then a rotted sac of bones, it was much more powerful than the entire episode of TGWW. 

Vincent and the doctor had more emotional power than this entire episode.

I agree that the conditions in the housing bubble was created through political interferance, but it was also exacerbated by MBS and the creation of all these hybrid derivative instruments that even the banks themselves apparently did not understand.

I do not know what the perfect soloution is, but I do think that retail banks should be kept seperate, from investment banks, and possibly limited in how they are allowed to invest their deposits.    We need to understand the retail banking is a totally different business from investment banking - and need  different rules and regulations and solvency levels.


I do not see it as dismanteling or making banks weaker.  Just redefining the boundries and the risks they can take with other peoples money. I do not know how a tiered approach would work unless they were seperate.

You don't just toss in a few contradictions and paradoxes, you work out how, *according to your vision as a writer*, time travel works in the universe that you created and how those paradoxes play out. And you stick to it.

It's not at all the same things as saying that ""vampires of a certain franchise are wrong"" (though I still veto on Twilight...but I digress)
The thing is that WITHIN your own universe, things do have to make sense. Let's say that in one universe vampires can walk in daylight and in another they can't. That's all right. However, if  within the *same* universe vampires either walk in daylight or burn to crisp randomly, without any explanation, then we've got a writing problem.

Same for time travel. I don't care if he's explaining it as a grandfather paradox, or the Tardis core doing wacky things,...but saying *blah blah timey wimey* says to me: ""Oh, I didn't even research on how that would work within the universe I'm creating"". *No need* to explain it to the audience * we'll just blow shit up, add some River, make it funny and it will all be swell*.

I'm exaggerating, of course, but you see what I mean.

You don't have to be ""hardcore"" to question serious issues or to make your plot lines consistent. Or to actually write a satisfactory resolution without things dragging on.

Yes, the writers are overly forgetful about Rory's 2000 year stint as the Lone Centurion. But that in no way detracts from Amy's 36 years alone, nor does it make her any less of a person for growing bitter towards the Doctor in that time.

Firstly, I don't think it would be in Rory's nature to even say this to Amy - he could see she's traumatised, and he's a nurse. He's going to want to help her, not see who can boast about the longest time being left alone.

Secondly, this is the third time the Doctor has left Amy and not returned for a long time. I would argue that she is far angrier at the Doctor (calling it a sonic probe) than Rory - but Rory gets stuck in the middle of her hate.

Thirdly, Amy is human. Rory was not - he spent those years as plastic and had to make a effort to cling to his humanity. Amy had no such motivation, and was left alone to stew in her thoughts.

Tea bags are usually made with low quality 'dust' which has less flavour and sometimes comes with a slightly odd taste which I believe is caused by the glue used in the bag. Higher quality tea comes as loose leaves which you just put in the teapot and filter out somehow after brewing. There are several different kinds of black tea such as ceylon, assam and darjeeling, which are distinguished by where they are grown, but also there are green teas oolong teas and white teas which all have their own varieties too. All of these can also be blended to form inumerable different blends, English breakfast tea that you find in your teabag only being one such example.

The moral questions posed in *The Girl Who Waited* are far too similar to the conundrum facing the TARDIS trio regarding Melody/River to be simply coincidental. IIRC, Moffat did some serious rewriting of this episode, so it is entirely possible that this episode is far more arc-heavy than it appears on the surface.

It's likely that at some point in the future, the Doctor will be forced to make a choice; allow his closest friends to raise their child in a proper environment and face forever losing the women he loves, or leave things as they are and effectively betray those who he cares for deeply.

With the level of guilt the Doctor is currently harbouring (as reinforced in *Lets Kill Hitler*) I find it hard to believe that he would deliberately choose to further screw-up the lives of his companions. He knows it has to stop, and it has to stop now.

There are only two things I can glean from this chart:

 1. other countries do things differently -- so what?
 1. the NHS is a large organisation -- so what?

Maybe it's that it reminds me of the time Daniel Hannan used its size to attack the NHS by saying, ""It's the second-largest employer in the world after the Chinese army."" that really pisses me off about this graphic.

Because of that I think it's a sneaky attempt to say: NHS == Communist, ergo NHS should be privatised. It's disingenuous and downright slimy propaganda.

The implication was highlighted in the SJA episode that Matt Smith was in where he spoke to Jo Grant about visiting her as the 10th Doctor.

Each Time Lord started out with 12 regenerations - meaning 13 reincarnations.  But the Time Lords could also bestow more regenerations if they wanted to.  Should be noted that the 10th Doctor used two regenerations (one into his hand) so he may be down to 12 reincarnations now although that could be up to the writer's discretion of whether that counts.

I believe Moffat has acted as though the regeneration limit is over with since the Time Lords became Time Locked, although I don't know of anything that marks that stance as canon.  Either way it wouldn't be a difficult thing to overcome if the writers chose to continue with it so yes pretty much forever

As far as the revived series is concerned, I never thought highly of the acting (although I loved the show) until the fifth season.

David was pretty rocky initially, but he hit his stride in a few episodes (I thought his best bit of acting was in The Girl in the Fireplace), and by the end he was decently believable. Freema was brilliant in everything she did, although she had to deal with what were arguably the worst episodes (The Lazarus Experiment, anyone?). The only person that I thought really brought their character to life was Catherine, but that's because she's just as derpy as Donna (seriously, that woman is a brick).

The fifth and the current seasons really amazed me, though. Everyone from Matt to Alex has done an exceptional job, and I'm sure it doesn't hurt that Moffat was the head writer.

Doctor Who fans are sometimes referred to as Whovians, most often by the American press. The usage was more common among fans in the United States during the 1980s, when the Doctor Who Fan Club of America (pronounced by members as Dwifca – now defunct) published the Whovian Times as its newsletter. It was seldom, if ever, used by the main British or Australian fan groups.[citation needed]

The earliest known use of 'Whovian', outside of the 'Whovian Times', is from Flaming Carrot Comics issue number 19 (circa 1988), when Flaming Carrot leads a combined group of Trekkies and Dr. Whovians into rebellion – note the now deprecated usage of 'Dr.'.

The plan was for the 6th Doctor to get progressively nicer as the show went on, but then there was that 18 month hiatus, and I think that was thanks to Mary Whitehouse who said DW was becoming too violent.

I should point out that if you are on /r/doctorwho for thejosh then you are on the wrong place, he moved the /r/josh and no longer posts new episodes here.

Also, if you are hoping a regeneration will change Doctor Who I am sorry to break it to you but.... chances of it ever being like it was in the RTD days again are slim to none. Doctor Who is more popular then it ever has been before because of the changes that have been made to the type of stories and characters. Not that Who wont change, but it wont change for a good long while. I would imagine that the current feel of the show will last... 5 more years, maybe more depending on how long Matt and Moffat stay.

If you are really, truly, holding out for a change you may just want to find another show. I cant see Doctor Who bringing you joy any more, not for a while at least. I hope though that you can learn to love Doctor Who as it is now, and move past what it once was so you can join the general community.

A deconstructon of Whovian themes in a comic, audio, or novel is different because it can be ignored. Doing it in the show itself is dangerous, becuase it ruins forever changing the image of an iconic, archetypical character defined by his role as the hero.

But *every* executive producer/head writer has their faults. YES, EVEN MOFFAT. 

On the other hand, yeah, I've seen a lot of people hate on Matt Smith simply because he's not David Tennant. I have one friend who said she isn't interested in watching cause he's 'not cute, like the other guy'. I had a small 'but but but he's not the SAAAAME' fit when we went from Eccleston to Tennant (and then with the transition to Eleven, I spent time sputtering about someone playing the Doctor being younger than me, which just seems *wrong*).

I do not like this deconstruction of the doctor's morality. I do not like looking at the Doctor and asking myself if he's a good guy or not. 

Asking myself how good he really is, and if he's just completely misguided is fine. Asking myself if he's downright amoral or not is not fine. 

This episode crossed a line for me. I understand that a lot of people like that, and I don't fault them. It's a very intelligent, well-written move.

But this week's episode felt like I would feel if I watched Sonic the Hedgehog turn his back on someone in need, or Big Bird cuss someone out, or Zordon kill someone in cold blood. I feel like I feel every time I watch the Star Trek episode where Data seemed to go evil of his own free will. I feel like I felt when the truth came out in Transformers: Dark of the Moon. I feel like I felt every time one of my so called friends sold me out to the popular kids in school.
 
Now, I'm all about deconstruction. I love the Watchmen. I love Evangelion. Deconstruction is fun. But I would not love the Watchmen if the original characters for which the idea had been pitched had been used. I don't like seriously, canonically turning characters into something that they are not.

Now, if I can ignore that and still be active in the fandom, that's fine. There are plenty of Transformers continuities and all I need to do is wait for the next one for a character I like to go back to being the character I like, and not this jerk face he's become. 

Doctor Who has one ""canon,"" the TV, and a bunch of non-canon. If the deconstruction were happening in non-canon I would be perfectly fine with it.

If it were done respectfully and had more reconstructive elements in the TV show, I would even be ok with it.

But twice in three seasons under two different producers, the Doctor has willingly destroyed a character I loved, whom he also claims to love, out of alleged love, under false pretenses and subtle deception. Twice now he has run away from someone because he can't face his responsibility for them in a way that is cruel, unusual, and in some cases paramount to if not actually killing them. 

And the last time, he could probably have hidden his deceit and let her go in peace, but he WAITED FOR HER TO LOOK AND SEE HIM BEFORE HE SHUT THE DOOR. That's just cruel! It's just mean! That's not how you treat your friends! The Doctor is not the man I wanted to be anymore. This is not my show anymore.

No business for example would work at a loss providing life saving drugs. It's bad business and totally unsustainable. The NHS however COULD do this through the nature of being a nationalised organisation funded by taxes. It's an advantage of the different approach, and it's one fundamental reason why we shouldn't constantly seek to introduce concepts at the core of the private sector into public sector work. We can afford to be wasteful as long as the net gains from this waste benefits the public at large. A private business could not because they would run themselves into the ground with such a model.

It is totally agreeable that efficiency should be in the public sector however - wasteful spending is certainly a concern. I just feel this kind of control shouldn't be driven by private sector experience.

In this example, I don't feel that having promotion prospects is a bad idea. It would reward people with the desire to work in the NHS, it would capture some of the best talent in the country by being one of the best employers and as such equally has the potential to bring fresh ideas out of academic backgrounds with these prospects. Strip that away because you think that someone working for the NHS doesn't deserve promotions as they're meant to be for healthcare professionals only and you're taking away one of the sources of innovation for the healthcare sector in the UK.

There should be a review of various review boards and committees however.

""justice"" campaigns that combine policy creation with pressure group activity. The 'progressive' ones he mentions are of this breed, and the conservative equivalents invariably revolve around NIMBYism (in my opinion)

""wonktanks"" that is, think tanks with a sole or dominant selection from academia. These are ones attached to or affiliated with universities, and I'll hesitantly lump the law society in with them. 

""corporate tanks"" which are the bad guys of the article. These are invariably run by, or financially propped up by, companies or individuals who are hoping to benefit from the side effects of legislation for business, political or social (as in culture wars) gain.

I'd generally say university tanks, though prone to biases in whichever direction, as the 'cleanest', followed by issue tanks. 

The corporate tanks are obviously problems, but they exist on the left too. The fact that this author picked the 'nice' lefty think tanks doesn't change this.

The best they could have hoped before before the election was to be in a solid position of opposition. The unprecedented coalition changed the nature of how they had to operate and do it quickly.

Alot of English people see low level retail jobs as something to be ashamed of - which is crazy. Sales is one of the only areas where people with a good attitude can really excel and progress in to a good career.

&gt; United Kingdom citizens have a negative right to freedom of expression under the common law. In 1998, the United Kingdom incorporated the European Convention, and the guarantee of freedom of expression it contains in Article 10, into its domestic law under the Human Rights Act. **There are many exceptions including** incitement, incitement to racial hatred, incitement to religious hatred, incitement to terrorism including encouragement of terrorism and dissemination of terrorist publications, glorifying terrorism, collection or possession of information likely to be of use to a terrorist, **threatening, abusive, or insulting speech or behaviour**, treason including imagining the death of the monarch, sedition, obscenity, indecency including corruption of public morals and outraging public decency, defamation, prior restraint, restrictions on court reporting including names of victims and evidence and prejudicing or interfering with court proceedings, prohibition of post-trial interviews with jurors, scandalizing the court by criticising or murmuring judges, time, manner, and place restrictions, harassment, privileged communications, trade secrets, classified material, copyright, patents, military conduct, and limitations on commercial speech such as advertising.

So apparently freedom of speech doesn't include insulting each other...wow, just wow.

true,ananinginaneana,scottish,Ex-Exile,"Changes to the tax system will not help those on benefits as they are currently below the threshold for liability. With regards to the Universal Credit somehow I don't think it will help either. From the [direct.gov](http://www.direct.gov.uk/en/Nl1/Newsroom/DG_191344) website;

The new Universal Credit system aims to:

*simplify the system, making it easier for people to understand, and easier and cheaper for staff to administer

*improve work incentives

*smooth the transitions into and out of work

*reduce in-work poverty

*cut back on fraud and error


It seems that the changes are mostly designed to cut costs.

If the government really wanted to get people into work and reduce the amount spent on benefits they really need to look at the tax credit system or how the clawbacks on Housing and Council Tax Benefits are calculated.

There are many part-time jobs available, but if you take one you will (i) lose your Jobseekers Allowance - reasonable, and (ii) lose 85p from your Housing and Council Tax Benefit for every £1 you earn over the Jobseeker Allowance amount - this is equivalent to a marginal tax rate of 85%!!!! Not even millionaire bankers pay that level of marginal tax. Unfortunately Working Tax Credits - which are supposed to make up this shortfall - only kick in if you work over 30 hours a week. So most who take up part-time jobs will not be able to claim Working Tax Credits but will still lose their Housing and Council Tax Benefit. Only being able to keep 15p from every £1 you earn over the benefits level is not really an incentive to take a part-time job (which will probably involve greater costs in getting to and from work etc and leave you worse off).

Reduce the hours needed to qualify for Working Tax Credits or reduce the clawback from Housing and Council Tax Benefits and more people will take part time work - immediately reducing the government's spend on Job Seekers Allowance, there will be a reduction on Housing and Council Tax Benefit and, as these people will have more money in their pockets, higher spending in the high street.

However, imagine if the Lansley plan goes ahead, and gp consortia (or whatever they're called now) buy care from a lot of private hospitals. Private hospital industry grows, public hospitals shrink. In 20 years you might end up in a situation where a lot of England's healthcare infrastructure is privately, rather than publicly owned.

For example: the American military has over the decades started outsourcing a lot of things it used to do itself. For example, it used to build a lot of its own battleships. Now it buys them from private companies, with all the pluses and minuses that entails.

I don't think it's wholly misleading to say that battleship production in the US has been privatised.

&gt; Anyway, its a moot point, as about half the NHS budget goes to private companies already - as they are the ones providing the drugs, bandages, ambulance petrol, bricks/mortar etc that the NHS needs to function.

There's a difference between buying things from suppliers and outsourcing your core functions. In particular (with the exception of GPs, who only have one customer) at the moment all decisions about medical treatment are taken by state employees. That will change under the new system.

The more recent one had questions that wouldn't seem out of place in a Blue Peter Annual whilst the older one was actually quite tricky.

But regardless of that, an 'A' should not just be an arbitrary high mark. It should mean that you are above the large majority of others who take the same exam. Since it is becoming easier to get an 'A', whether due to better teaching or easier exams, something needs to change to make it so that only the best get 'A' grades.

Personally, I think the overall grades should remain about the same year-on-year. If people are getting smarter, make the exams harder to match.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt; Even if we do end up with an NHS that is provided entirely by contracted employees - why is that such a bad thing?

I don't think it's necessarily a bad thing, but I think as a matter of fact systems that are contracted out in this way tend to be much less cost-effective - look at our continental neighbours. They pay a lot more for comparable results.

Furthermore, I think that health rationing is a very important topic, and one that should be decided as publically and openly as possible. I think this is better done with open national procedures (like NICE), and not by burying it in a 'commissioning' system, where rationing is hidden away in contracts and 'commercial' decisions.

&gt; If a monolithic organisation can do that better than contractors, fine keep it. But if contractors can deliver the same service for less - then for goodness sake, make the switch over and as quickly as possible.

I think a large part of the current controversy is that the government is claiming that they are making this change purely because contractors are more efficient, but almost all the evidence seems to point the other way.

Finally, there's a point about democracy. The NHS is a major part of the country's social fabric, and very important to a lot of people. If such major changes are to be made, they should be openly discussed and voted for at an election. If the Tories had included these changes in their election manifesto (and not just vague musings about 'giving doctors more choice'), and people had voted for them, then fair enough.

But in fact, the Tories talked about 'putting an end to top-down reorganisations', which most people understood to mean they'd leave basic structures alone for a few years. Instead what Lansley seems to have meant is that there'll be no top-down changes because he's going to fragment the structure so no such reorganisations will be possible.

Part of the issue is that these changes will be very hard to reverse. Once contracts are signed and private hospitals are built, etc, it will be very hard to return the NHS to its previous form. And that might be fine, if people had voted for the change - they would know what they were getting into. But that's not what happened. It's about democracy.",0,1315938626,null,0,false,0,c2jlwnp,t3_kdi70,t1_c2jlwnp,t1_c2jlrjk,1427595511,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

Nobody says that the government can't do anything not listed in the manifesto. Of course things change, and governments have the right to change their policies in light of events.

In the NHS case, firstly it seems dishonest for the government to try to implement massive changes that were not even hinted at in the manifesto, and which the Tories had obviously been sitting on for some time - Lansley sure came out with those proposals quick after the election, didn't he?

But in this case especially, there are two extra things: (1) there was stuff about health in the manifesto, about no top-down changes, that in retrospect wasn't just short but actively misleading; (2) everybody knows that if these proposals *had* been in the manifesto, it would have cost the Tories votes.

true,edsballs,null,null,"I think the problem is definitely regulation but the right balance needs to be struck. Remember a basic risk reward ratio is 3.1. Risk one to gain 3. If business gets swamped in regulation then it restricts the potential return. Banks would focus heavily upon risk and start to be extremely restrictive in who they lend to which in turn hampers social mobility and economic growth. At the same time going to the other extreme letting banks leverage themselves to the hilt and take greater risk for greater return is something which needs to be monitored.

I think one of the areas which needs to be really focused upon is the area of leverage. A precedent was set when hedge fund long term capital management, a highly leveraged fund packed with nobel prize winners, almost collapsed and got bailed out as it posed systemic risk.

To the greedy bankers the affair said that they had carte Blanche to go for it as they knew that there was a safety net beneath them. They were able to leverage up and go for broke as they would be underwritten by the gov. 

Now, if a sensible level of leverage was permitted then this cycle would not have started as investors would have had more grounded aspirations and known that failure meant a collapse in their reputation and livelihood. 

This is what is meant by free markets. If u fail you go bust. Now, ideologically I am opposed to bailouts but at the moment now after 30 years of political intervention it is hard to apply this theory as the whole system would implode. Saying that though, recessions and depressions are like forest fires burning away deadwood. If they don't happen they come back stronger. It's a catch 22 really. 

GLB act was significant changing point but also jimmy carters community reinvestment act needs consideration too. 

Underneath this I will post a short piece I wrote for a client summarising the thirty year super cycle we are coming to the end of. 

To conclude, regulation is a good idea. We have been devoid it for a long time but it should be in the right area. If banks can't get stupid leverage rates and know that if they fail it's career game over then they regulate themselves. ",0,1315941449,null,0,false,0,c2jmckz,t3_kcvyj,t1_c2jmckz,t1_c2jfflc,1427595720,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

In this document, our aim is to make a brief but focused assessment of the strengths and weaknesses of mainstream investment strategies over the past few decades. We will look at the motives of investors, the concept of risk management and the ever present battle between fear and greed when evaluating investment opportunities. Our main premise is that whilst things have evidently gone terribly wrong, the system and mainstream strategies are sustainable and do indeed work, but only when those administering and applying them remain vigilent and avoid complacency. In the eternal words of one of the modern ages foremost economic thinkers, John Maynard Keynes, ""When the facts change, I change my mind. What do you do sir?""
Background
It may sound outlandish, but the events of the past few years can be loosely attributed to one man, Johnny Cash, the singer of 'The Story of a Broken Heart'. His death in 2003 within months of his wife's passing lead to proclamations that he had indeed died of a broken heart. Whilst unfair to besmirch Cash's name in such a manner, his passing became synonymous with the concept of default correlation, a study headed by Chinese actuary David Li which looked at the statistical probability of a persons death shortly after that of their partners. 
By considering a persons death as being the same as the default of a company, the concept enthralled Wall Street who now believed that they had found a mathematically proven foundation upon which to package, securitise and perpetually diversify risk. Other contributing factors included President Carter's Community Reinvestment Act of 1977 which enforced the loosening of lending restrictions and President Clinton's Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999 which enabled financial institutions to perform multiple functions under the same umbrella such as retail banking, brokerage, insurance and securitisation. Default risk was believed to be a issue of the past and an era of mass credit expansion ensued which lead to the notions of sub-prime, ninja loans and a near thirty year super bubble which has only just burst. 
In this environment of self congratulatory opportunity, previously held notions of diversification became blurred as a new overriding macro interpretation claimed dominance and those who took bigger risks gained bigger returns. The emergence of synthetic markets such as Credit Default Swaps (CDS's) developed as an insurance based form of diversification. The collapse of the US sub-prime mortgage Market in 2007-08 caused a seizure in global liquidity as banks and institutions who previously thought that they were diversified found out that quite the opposite was true.
We live in a constantly changing world where attitudes towards the risk return relationship have evolved dramatically over the past decade. The belief in the ability to package and securitise risk saw the global economy pushed towards a precipice which it has not yet fully eluded. The pursuit of perpetual returns saw greed triumph over fear, but now as we collectively look to navigate a path through the resulting debris it is perhaps fear which presents us with the biggest hurdle of all. The investment community has by nature been the primary driver of growth the world over. However, in today's stagnant environment, this pivotal community has it's hands tied. Scolded for previously lending and investing irresponsibly, it is now scolded for the exact opposite reasons.

But the government can't be seen as to promote it by making it cheap enough that people will buy it easily. And the tax level will have to raise enough money to justify the change. The government will only legalise it as a money earner. Charging £5 would completely miss the point, unless that was for a single joint.

There were a few problems for me within the episode; 
For example, when Rory tells Amy ""Just push the button"" (so that she can join them in this room) surely knowing that it is an alien world, where they have no idea how anything works or operates, he would be careful enough to tell her to press the green anchor button!
Also, despite having never been told how to, Amy just makes a sonic screwdriver from whatever was lying around? One of the most useful pieces of technology in all the universe? Manages to 'hack' a sophisticated piece of alien technology?

There were far too many large conveniences for my liking.

On top of that, I felt like even with Karen Gillan's great acting for each Amy, I just couldn't understand why they were hung up about only saving the young Amy? It would be as if the older Amy had never existed, so she literally wont feel upset, angry or anything for that matter...

Ten in particular felt sort of afraid of himself, which pushed him further towards running away - with Family of Blood he could have destroyed his opponents from the start, but he'd rather run and hide until he had absolutely no other choice.  Eleven, on the other hand, seems to relish that darkness and violence; he's got so many moments of absolute and entirely self-aware ruthlessness.

There is really no way to keep perfect continuity in a show about time travel that has been around for more than 40 years. Nor would it be particularly interesting if he did; constraining the plot to things that are unequivocally harmonious with everything that came before would be a.) impossible, because even the classic series contradicts itself, and b.) boring, because it would cut off so many avenues for show development.
EDIT: Also, this was written by MacRae. Unless Moffat has free reign to insert major plot devices into his writers' scripts at will, and exercises that right on every episode, there's a good enough chance that the inconsistencies were of MacRae's design.

What I mean by *Family of Blood* is that, for his ""no other choice"" was vindicative, nasty and took revenge. There are places out there in the Whoniverse that cater as prisons for criminals, but he chose not to do that, his punishment was full on revenge. Copied from wikipedia because I'm lazy:

&gt;He pushes Mother of Mine out of the TARDIS into the event horizon of a collapsing galaxy, wraps Father in unbreakable chains forged in the heart of a dwarf star, traps Sister in every mirror in existence, and suspends Son of Mine as a scarecrow.

As for Eleven,

&gt;Eleven seems to glory in his role as an army general: when Rory tells him that he makes people dangerous to himself (in the Ancient Venice episode), he doesn't seem to care in the slightest,

He does. He pushes Amy away and refuses to let her come with him for Rory's sake, and sends them back to the TARDIS.

&gt;in A Good Man Goes to War he's only too happy to rally an army.

Crucially, though, he plans it so not a drop of blood is spilled. They take Demon's Run through strategic planning, not through brute force. The Headless Monks force a battle, not the Doctor. He was prepared for the clerics to all flee - it didn't matter to him at that point because he had saved Amy.

true,d_r_benway,null,null,"Rather than sack lots of police/nurses, etc (i.e destroy the very fabric of society by raping our public services) I think legalising cannabis should seriously considered.

We should cut the cost to the police and legal services of keeping cannabis criminalised, that should prevent some people losing their job .

Also you may be able to get joe public to support the action if it might save their jobs - it might help people to re-access the importance of keeping it illegal in the first place.)

How about - Legalise cannabis, Save police jobs !

It would cut the link to crime that the majority of otherwise law abiding criminals have - I do not break the law at all except the cannabis law (almost daily) 

One other issue that never gets mentioned is the contamination of cannabis -  which is poisoning the very children the government always claim to want to protect when they remove our civil liberties. (the reclassification was done to 'protect the kids..'

The max sentence for growing cannabis is 14 fucking years - It is morally insane that **MY** tax money goes to arrest people like me - who do no harm to society in any way.

- I would prefer if the money I spent on cannabis went to the country through tax  (which desperately needs it) rather than to scum

- decriminalisation would improve relations and trust between youth and police (some may say this is semi urgent now...)

- As I have a job (and have had for over 10 years) I pay my own way (and taxes)  - if I were to be jailed for cannabis the tax payer would be paying for my stay at 'her majesty's pleasure' - is that what tax payers want - do you want to pay for my food and rent??? 

Until they decriminalise cannabis the police are effectively at war with a large section of the citizens of this country who are otherwise law abiding.

The reason so many laugh at the rags to riches is that they/we know it's a crock of shite that is peddled to the masses. A tiny percentage of people do manage it but the reality is that we're in a country with terrible levels of social mobility.

I didn't go to public school but being left money, given a living allowance etc. is something I considered normal. It's the reason why I'm very aware of the advantages my parents jobs/life have conferred upon me. While I didn't have a house bought for me, I inherited the deposit. I might not have got my current job through my parents connections but that's what I did in the beginning before uni.

What I would say is that the middle classes are no more insular than anyone else, they have their little bubble of reality and so do other groups. The only difference is that many people in it believe their current position is based entirely on hard work and had nothing to do with the area they went to school in, the fact that they didn't have to work through uni and the natural confidence you get from a lifetime of being told you'll do something impressive,.

Many universities are very parochial, I found that once you get into the marketplace it's much better.

true,edsballs,null,null,"I think you make some good points. Whilst there is an element of risk in derivatives, ironically they are actually used primarily and successfully to help manage risk but harking back to my other post, the key lies in regulating leverage. If people dont have access to the sweet jar they dont get a sugar rush. Believe it or not derivatives date back to close to the dark ages. Rice farmers in Japan created futures contracts to hedge away the risk of a poor crop or collapse in price by selling next seasons crop in advance and locking in a guaranteed price. Even the way traders trade today ie using Japanese candlestick dates back to those days. It's amazing how they developed accurate strategies based upon the subject. It's worth googling if you get the chance. You will be impressed.

Derivatives also hold other value too. Let's say we have one million to invest and we want to buy a stock or commodity. We have absolute conviction that this is where our money NEEDS to be but our problem is that there isn't enough supply for us to get in on the action. Nobody is selling. A derivative in that asset class will be a synthetic replication of that assets behaviour which exists in a synthetic Market where if you can find somebody to take the opposite bet, you can trade that asset. 

Derivatives are also used to hedge away risk. A stocks beta represents it's sensitivity... A beta of 1 means a stock moves in perfect tandem with it's respective Market. A stock with a beta of 1.25 means that the stock is 25% more sensitive than the Market. A beta of 0.75 is 25% less volatile than the Market. Now if u want to buy a stock and minimise risk you buy the stock of beta 1.25 and sell the derivative of the Market. So if the Market goes up 5%, you loose 5% on your derivative, but you make 6.25% on your stock. A net profit of 1.25%. On the downside if the Market falls 5% u make 5% on the derivative and loose 6.25% on the stock. A net loss of 1.25% which a lot more palatable than a 6.25% loss for investors.

Whilst there is a lot of 'oooga boooga' talk about derivatives in the media often by populist career  politicians who don't understand them or their purpose, by and large they are pretty boring instruments. The reason I say by and large is because I agree with you that instruments like cds's are dangerous land mines. However, in my opinion they are not dangerous because they are derivatives... They are dangerous because they are effectively an insurance policy which can be taken out on any asset regardless of ownership. We cannot take out life insurance on somebody else or our neighbours house for obvious reasons, but you can do with a CDS.

But it does have a large flaw in that you grade is determined by other students rather than by yourself. You could be border line A grade, but some kids find a particular section easy and that will knock you down to a B. It makes exams a competition rather than... and exam.

I don't think it's fair to dynamically change what a grade is based on the results of that same exam.

By increasing/decreasing the difficulty of the exam based on previous results, I think you'd have a much fairer system, similar to what we have now but creating a steady level playing field.

As discussed above, I think 10 was arguably more vindictive in Family of Blood than 11 was in A Good Man Goes to War.  11 truly was pushed into those actions - Amy and her baby had been kidnapped and his enemies were raising an army against him.  Despite this, when he raised up his own army in return, he used them to execute a bloodless takeover of Demon's run.  No one was killed by his hand or on his orders.  And personally, I'd rather be Colonel Runaway than that poor guy spending all eternity as a scarecrow, for example.

What I really find interesting, though, is when you said that you don't think 10 would have lied to old Amy in The Girl Who Waited.  I couldn't disagree more.  Both 9 and 10 had a long a proud history of lying to and/or tricking their companions when they felt it was necessary.  I'm reminded of the time 9 sent Rose back home in the Tardis against her will in the first season finale, the time 10 snuck up on Rose and put the teleportation device over her neck to send her to the parallel world in the second season finale, and, of course, what he did to Donna in order to protect her at the end of the 4th season.

9 and especially 10 could be just as cold and manipulative as 11 when they needed to be, and that's a big part of why* I* feel the Doctor is such a great, well fleshed out character.

Being a ""vet"" of the classic Who, I can say for sure that 11 is somewhat channelling the older, dark incarnations at times. That's not in dispute. The Time War, however, really did change him.

Me: O_O

true,Hollitron,null,null,"That's the beauty of the ""reboot"" though. It lays a rock solid foundation for newcomers without trampling all over the past. The ""modern Doctor"" (Ie 9 onwards) can be, in essence, an original character. And its aiming to keep that sort of attitude. The occasional throwback is nice, but Moffat is very much pushing the boundaries of the show. Personally, I'll never not watch it- I love Who and my ""brand loyalty"" if you will keeps me here. But I am aware of how radically different the show is these days. It's more akin to Buffy the Vampire slayer (IE one super plot with the occasional monster of the week) than say the RTD ""The Doctor and Rose land the TARDIS on &lt;PLANET/SHIP/HISTORICAL TIME PERIOD HERE&gt;.

The issue is, really, Moffat -radically- changed everything very very quickly. Within the first episode, you had a new: Title, Theme, Doctor, TARDIS, Sonic, Companion. Don't get me wrong, I like it. I think the Silence just might be the best thing to come out of Who, ever. But long arc driven stories have really messed with the magic. It's not bad, just different. For example, the last scene in DOTM. I saw the preview for the Pirates and all I could think was ""Yes yes, cutesy Pirates that'll get wrapped up in 40 minutes. What about the [spoiler](/s "" REGENERATING CHILD!? THAT'S KIND OF A BIG DEAL! "") That'd never happen in the RTD era. 

**TL;DR: It's not 11 that's off. It's the show itself, but he's sort of the ""public face"" of it**

How is it harassment when the memorial was open to the public? Did the family send out invites to everyone on the planet for the real life memorial?  No.  Its the internet, not real life.  None of those laws or analogies apply here (thats what makes it so great).  It is NOT the same as going to a real world memorial and harrassing the bereaved in ANY way...  The internet is nothing but text, peroid.  Text on a screen that you can turn off whenever you want.  Text can only hurt you if you let it, any intelligent person can handle a little bit of e-harassment, and realize its just some random person trying to get a rise out of them.  Nobody forced the family to use the internet, or make the memorial public, or read what people wrote, or get upset about it for that matter.  They did that to themselves because they are not intelligent.

 What if the individual who was jailed took the proper precautions to obscure his identity?  How would they have ever found him?  All this jailing has done is told potential cyber-bullies that they should post their hate from their friends/librarys/public internet connction, behind a proxy, as to not get caught.   It is entirely the family's fault for not making the memorial private to only those who need access.   Now that all cyber bullies know to take the precautions to not get caught, what good does this ruling do?  None.  It just made the cyber bullies smarter.  Its an affront to free speech and can be abused, plain and simple.

Believe me, i dont condone what this man did or said... it was vile.   But jail for something like this is soooo fucking stupid, i cant even believe there's a debate.

Bosingwa is in great form, and despite the great goal, I don't yet trust Luiz on the field in such an important match (he had about three challenges that could have easily been yellow carded).

It's a tough one between Ramires and Meireles for me, but Meireles is on fire since joining the club. Lampard has to be in the lineup (anybody who has seen the chance-creation stats on his season thusfar would have to agree).

How does spending resources on sending this person to jail help anyone?  It just made cyberbullies smarter so now they know to use proxies and fake identies for their hate, so they cant be tracked down in the first place.

This judgement was a waste of resources, and an affront to freespeech.  Why do we need a nanny state keeping us from being offended?  Trolls exist, they always will, the Family should have been smart enough to make the memorial private.

Text on a computer screen cant harrass you.  You can turn the monitor off at any time and walk away.  Its not like real life AT ALL, period.

The fact that none of those laws apply on the internet is what makes it great.  The second the government has a mechanism to censor anyone for any reason, even as vile as this one, it can and will be abused.  Not that it even matters, because now people will know to obscure their identity...  its so stupid its not even a debate.

PNG - Good for things with lots of solid colors. Screenshots of webpages, applications, or things which use a small color palette (comics, esp of the f7u12/rage variety). Bad for real life images, photographs, game screenshots. Sizes can be smaller than JPG if conditions are right.

JPG - Pretty much the inverse of PNG. Anything with text or well-defined lines or a simple color palette will get fuzzy no matter how high you set the quality. However, natural real-life images or photographs look great with JPG compression. There's nothing wrong with using JPG for a photograph, even if you are concerned about quality. The size tradeoff between PNG and JPG for a real-life still image can easily be upwards of 10x smaller with JPG.

Applying these laws to the internet does nothing but force people to make sure they are untouchable.  Its a lot easier than you think to anonymise all of your internet activity.  Just download the TOR browser package, and you will be able to find any and all child pornography you want and there is absolutely nothing anyone can do about it, period.

Have any of those laws helped stop child pornography?  No, its EVERYWHERE on TOR.... 

Have any of those laws stopped fuad from happening?  No, people are just smarter about it.

The internet IS a rather magical place... if you start jailing people over this stuff, they can and will make it impossible for you to find them, especially if its by threat of jail.  Its that simple.  I guess punishing stupid people for being stupid and admitting to things isnt all bad, but its not going to stop anything, its just going to waste your tax dollars and make them use TOR next time.  Just going to smarten people up.

Laws for some of those things are certainly a good thing, but offending someone over the internet with text and MEME images, is hardly a jailable offense.  I found some of his postings to be rather funny, even though i know they were hurtful to the family.  Its all subjective.  Theres way to much grey area in ""cyber bullying"".

You can turn it off and walk away at any time.   A computer screen cannot ""harass you"".  The fact that other people in the world can make foreign text appear on it is entirely inconsequential. 

Its the internet.  The family should have known better than to make the memorial page public to anyone and everyone.  Did the family send out invites and publicize the real-life memorial to everyone on the planet?  No.  Of course someone is going to troll a public memorial page, and no amount of jailing or even punishing anyone in any way is going to change that, ever, period.  Nor should it, this is what makes the internet so great.   

I DO NOT CONDONE WHAT THIS PERSON DID IN ANY WAY, IT WAS VILE, but the family is at fault for not taking more precautions with their privacy on the internet.  This is a case of computer illiteracy, not harassment.

This man only had contact with them because they let him.   They only let text on a computer monitor hurt them because they are unaware of what an internet troll is.  All jailing this guy is going todo is make him make sure he uses an anonymizing service like TOR next time.  Then they wont be able to track him down anyways... so therefor it really is entirely the family's responsibility for their own privacy on the internet.  They should have made the page private.

""WHY SHOULD THEY HAVE TO?""  because its retarded to spend that much money on a government nanny state, when simple personal responsibility does the trick.  Learn about protecting your internet privacy....

In the old series, during one the specials (not sure which Doctor) it was established that he has only 13 incarnations, with 12 regenerations. Following this, he has only 2 more regenerations left.

However, Moffat (or somebody deeply involved in the current writing of the show) has said that he's not sure if he'll keep it. He said it cryptically, of course, but it was heavily implied that this either isn't canon anymore or that the Doctor will find a way to keep going.

It's also interesting to note that other Time Lords have broken this rule, most notably Rassilon. As it was explained once, it's theorized that he's in a constant state of regeneration, i.e., he's literally regenerating himself eternally, giving him the ability to live forever.

Don't get me wrong, TGWW was a brilliant episode, but I knew from the start that Rory was going to choose ""his"" Amy. Even though his love for her has spanned thousands of years, he was still going to choose the Amy he knew. There wasn't enough content to ever convince me otherwise.
That was what caused me to not enjoy the episode on first viewing. I watched it a few more times, and I was finally able to get past that initial feeling and enjoy it for what it is, but up until this season I have never had to watch an episode 2+ times to enjoy it.

Many various people run exit nodes, very likely some are honey pots as you have stated.

The technology is there, and always will be.  No amount of legislation, and strong arming by the government will change that fact.  Nor should it, its the very thing that has made the internet so great.  

True anonymity is absolutely possible on the internet, be it through TOR or MANY MANY MANY other means, and always will be.

    The former Tory peer also claimed Indian families had a different

    ""Indians have fallen into the pattern here,"" she told peers.
    ""They do not have large families because they are like the Jews of old.
    They want their children to be educated.

    ""This is the other problem - there is no emphasis on education
    in the Pakistani and Bangladeshi families.""

So basically we have a person who is Indian culturally saying Indians are fucking awesome, and people who come from India's neibouring nations are uneducated and breeding excessivly just for government benefits.

And this is the kind of person Reddit respects?

Yeah, except saying Moffat and the writers can't piss off the fans is not a good reason why the Doctor knows he has to die. This theory doesn't make sense because its circular. You start with the fact that the lake incident happens and work from there - with the only justification behind it being the incident itself. 

The theory is weak because if true, there are few plausible justifications as to why the Doctor would kill himself. I think they've made it pretty clear that River was in the suit. For starters - its been explicitly said by a character on the show (in Lets Kill Hitler). Secondly, its obvious that the finale is going to center around River's involvement in all this. If the Doctor kills himself where does she fit in?

Sorry you wasted all this time on an infographic, but you're theorizing about something thats already been answered.

River's motivation is that she was brainwashed by the Silence. Their motivation is still unknown (and can't be guessed at given the current information).

Also, because they left her in the hospital as the new River, at the end of LKH, with the implication from the Doctor that it was time to let River go and be herself now - a bit like pushing the baby chicklets out of the nest and watching them fly.  I don't think Amy was completely happy with this, but seemed to accept it.

So as things stand, their involvement with River is kinda done.  I wouldn't be surprised if this either changes by the end of the series in some way (or we at least get more of the Williams' take on events).

There's no such thing as an at-will state or at-will employment here, and companies have to treat you almost as a human being. 

We're close to Europe so you can explore a different culture every weekend (and the amount of vacation time we get means you actually can!) 

Within England, there are radically different environments to explore and you could spend ages seeing different things and meeting different people.

Our weather can be a bit shite, and the amount of daylight we get in winter can be depressing. 

The food in a lot of places isn't as varied or flavourful as it could be, but with a bit of hunting around, you'll find the good stuff.

We have an amazing range of beers and ciders :D 

Houses here are generally smaller than in America, except for in major cities like NYC. And detached houses aren't really that common, so you'll probably end up sharing at least one wall with a neighbor. This can be awful, depending on the neighbor. 

Internet speed and availability is generally better than a lot of the USA, but we have the same issues with caps and throttling. 

What do you do for fun? What are the main things that bring you joy in life? A lot of those may or may not be available here, or might be ridiculously expensive. For example, I've never been able to find a batting cage here to go and just swing a bat at a ball for some fun. Mini golf is rare as hen's teeth, but real golf courses are plentiful if expensive. Bowling, one of the USA's fastest growing participant sports, is barely known here and good luck finding a league! Go karting is rare and expensive.

I'm really happy I did it, but it all depends on your circumstances. The most important thing is where you're moving from and where you'll be moving to. I went from NYC to London so the change was not that major in terms of what to expect from the city. If you're going from a big city to a small one, or vice versa, it might make the experience more isolating.

I find my cost of living is lower on average than it was in NYC, and there are tons more nice/safe neighborhoods that are centrally located and won't cost an arm and a leg. Quality of life tends to be higher too, for many of the reasons anonymouslemming stated.

The things I've found most difficult tend to be cultural differences you can't really avoid. Although not radically different, social interactions are not as open and...sober as they are in the US. Everything here is done over a beer. Everything. I'm a full-grown adult and I sometimes feel pressured to drink. I know some will disagree with me, but I feel that this propensity to drink comes from the fact that English people are less likely to open up emotionally unless they've had a few. If you're single don't expect a guy/girl to speak to you unless everyone is halfway drunk. 

Customer service here is also not what you've come to expect in the US. Few companies have 24/7 helplines and 0800 numbers actually cost money to call - a ten minute conversation to Vodafone about your cellphone bill could cost you £2. EVERY major shop closes by 5pm on Sundays due to some weird law I don't really understand. I've also found the process of opening a bank account to be especially tedious and convoluted, ditto for the process of renting a flat. But these things might be a bit easier for you as you'll be employed.

But yes, beyond some of the specifics mentioned above, it really does depend on where you're coming from/going. No matter what, it's a massive change, but that will determine just how massive!

- 2 ) Cybermen are shown and the word Torchwood is seeded. This sets up the finale.
- 3 ) Vote Saxon is seeded and the Watch is presented in Family of Blood, setting up the finale.
- 4 ) Planets disappear and Rose is shown a few times.

Then, Season 5, Moffat sets up the crack in Amy's house and sharpnel, and the fact that someone else might have driven the TARDIS. We even see River helping with the driving to show us she can (""The blue boringer buttons"").

So, let's take a look at Season 6. Which themes do we have:

- Gangers
- Two time streams (2 Amy's)
- Imaginary worlds and fake appearances (Night Terror)

I'm not sure if that necessarily follows (I'm not saying you're wrong, mind, just not sure that you're right).

Someone viewing properties would have no differentiating those properties that genuinely are ""two double bedroom"" and those that merely have two rooms at least as large as a double bed.  So they already know that they're buying a shoebox, or otherwise, and will make an offer or walk away as appropriate.

As you point out, it all comes down to what people are willing to pay.  But with demand outstripping supply, the prices keep rising.

Part of the problem as I see it, is that cheap credit means people can and will pay over-inflated prices for properties.  Instead of saying ""no, we can't afford it"", which in the long term would drive prices down, they just take out bigger and bigger mortgages to cover it.  The banks don't care because the price of property is forever rising.  So even if (or when, as interest rates rise) the borrower defaults, the bank is covered because the house they own is now worth more than the money they loaned to buy it.  The government love it because higher property prices means more tax revenue in stamp duty.  And the estate agents love it because they get paid on commission.  

Unfortunately, this only works while house prices are rising.  When the bubble bursts the whole house of cards comes tumbling down, potentially taking down the global economy with it (as in the sub-prime mortgage crisis in the US).  So don't expect anyone in power to work too hard to push house prices down.  They know what the consequences are.

They will, however, be seen to be doing all kinds of things that make it look like they're addressing the problem, while not actually doing anything useful at all.  e.g. Home Information Packs, releasing brown field sites to property developers to build more ""affordable"" housing (which is still sold at ""market value"", and hence is unaffordable, but makes great profit for those developers), and so on.

If house builders are not allowed to build shoe boxes any more and must adhere to minimum sound proofing and room size standards then you have a minimum property specification which is the bare minimum that can be offered. So yes, prices may well rise a bit if costs are increased which I am sure they will be.

However, this rise in cost will feed through the inflation figures and eventually (say 5-10 years) we'll be in the same situation we are today with not enough supply and too much demand. BUT we'll have decent sized houses :)

While it may well be easy to blame the builders for making easy money and we should do, it is the responsibility of local and central government for planning regulations. Many of these new builds, flats especially, should never have been built in the first place.

People will always over pay for houses because they are not purchases in the typical defintion, they are very emotional purchases and this skews the process.

One of the major problems we also have is that our cities are reluctant to have massive high-rise. We need to change this mentality and make flats a nice place to live. Take a look at Spain, houses in cities are quite rare and yet they have beautiful, spacious (and at the moment far too much supply) flats. It can be done, but we need to change our attitudes.

If you look at teh change in value of flats v houses over the long term it is clear that houses rise in value a lot quicker than flats, in fact flats only just hold their value. So for a home-owner buying a flat is crazy if you can buy a house. 

One of the reasons for this is because common areas in flats deteriorate over time and it is ""better"" to let something slip in to a slum and knock it down and start again rather than deal with how we share spaces.",0,1315998795,null,0,false,0,c2js9mf,t3_kf6ra,t1_c2js9mf,t1_c2js8gi,1427598576,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

It isn't bad for a week long holiday, but it does mean you're pretty much limited to England for the weekends. And it may just be due to living here all my life and it being a small country, but geographically it isn't especially interesting until you get up to the highlands (IMO). 

Also our politics are (relatively) sane. We don't have any huge political/religious debates about abortion or gay marriage, and there's nobody complaining about the government ""restricting their freedoms"" by not letting them have automatic grenade launchers. It's kinda nice being able to just watch the ridiculous political arguments from across the pond while being smug that they're not happening over here (although our current government is fairly shite...)",0,1316001092,null,0,false,0,c2jsdt9,t3_kf2j3,t1_c2jsdt9,t3_kf2j3,1427598631,7,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,7

true,UnoriginalGuy,welsh,Wales,"The reason both parents need to work is ironically because both parents in the previous generation worked. It is a cycle. If both parents work then they will bid more on a finite number of homes which in turn means the next lot of bidding is even higher and even harder to archive.     

But it isn't just about house prices. The world seems to be split into two kinds of societies:     

 - High female employment and high cost of living    
 - Low female employment and low cost of living   

Look at the US. House prices are much lower than here, but yet both parents normally need to work to run a middle-class household. If it was purely a matter of house prices then one might assume that if both parents worked in the US then that family would be ""wealthy"" but in real terms it seems as if middle class families continue to get poorer and poorer (relative to ten, twenty, or more years ago).    

As I said, it is an economic cycle that was started by the female-rights movement (i.e. women in work) and will likely never terminate. I have no solution to it. Women should be in work; that isn't the issue. The issue is how do women take a break for 18 years without the family going bankrupt or people crying because women make 75p to ever £1 a man makes...

true,employeeno5,dalek,Dalek,"Not really, in my own experience at least. What really matters in these regards is common dislikes, not likes. 

There are all kinds of people out there who love the same stuff as you that you're going to not like or get along with. They're going to like those things in different ways or different reasons, or perhaps also like things beyond the mutual stuff that you find to be a ""dealbreaker"". 

But when someone hates the same things you hate, you can almost be guaranteed that then they truly share a similar worldview/sense of humor/taste in art. Whether or not you've come across the same likes yet or not  doesn't matter (half the fun will be introducing your new mutual likes to each other), because you'll both be able to encounter these things for the first time with eyes that scrutinize the world in the same way. 

People like things for all kinds of reasons, in all kinds of manners, and in different contexts. Things people *really* hate though are very specific and very personal. Think of your closest friends. I bet lots of them like things you're not that into or even think are kind of lame and vice versa. I bet that as much as you might share there are also hobbies and interests and actives you don't share and movies you disagree on and so forth. But I bet the stuff that you all really, really hate; the stuff that really pisses you off in the world, or really comes across as truly dishonest or damaging culture are pretty much the same. 

I know people are broader than the things they like or dislike and why they feel what they feel about them, but just in the *sole* context of shared-interests and how far they can take you, I really think the likes matter very little compared to the dislikes. Or again, at least that's my experience. :)",0,1316014693,null,0,true,0,c2jtow8,t3_keplw,t1_c2jtow8,t1_c2jqibv,1427599248,8,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,8

true,TabascoQuesadilla,mcgann,McGann,"""The End of Time"" (both parts), so Ten was my first, but I consider Eleven to be ""my"" Doctor.

I'd been interested in the show beforehand, but was intimidated by how *much* of it there was.  And I'm a completist, so I wasn't willing to start it if I wasn't going to watch all 30 seasons.

But my friend got really into it during Series 4, and kept trying to get me to watch it.  So I heard that David Tennant was leaving at the end of the year, and I got sick over New Year's.  I figured, why the hell not, and downloaded both parts of ""The End of Time.""

I was so fucking confused, it wasn't even funny.  But I enjoyed it, and I liked Tennant.

I decided to give it a legitimate chance, and went to my local library and checked out Series 1.  I honestly don't know what got me through the first half of that season.  I think I vowed to give it a full season's worth of a chance to the show, which is good because I *hated* every minute of the first half of the season, with the exception of ""The Unquiet Dead.""

Then ""Father's Day"" happened, and I got interested ... then ""The Empty Child""/""The Doctor Dances"" happened, and I was in love.

I powered through Series 2-4 in the next week, watched the Specials, rewatched TEoT (which I liked better the second time) ... and a month or so later, Series 5 started.

The reason I consider Eleven to be ""my"" Doctor, despite the fact that I saw all of Nine and Ten first, is that he was the current Doctor when I started watching the show (since I watched TEoT a day or so after it aired, and thus after Ten regenerated, Eleven was technically the current Doctor) ... plus I love Eleven to bits, whereas I have significant problems with Nine and Ten.

Looking at the timing of this episode, it's probably about an hour or two after regenerating that he does this trip to the moon. After first crashing he's not with young Amelia for more than an hour, then needs 5 minutes to prevent the TARDIS engines phasing. After coming back 13 years later they quickly meet prisoner zero and find they have 20 minutes to save the earth, so I'm guessing two hours tops from first regenerating to going to the moon. For other regenerations (like where 10 lost his hand) the regeneration is still good for repair for almost a day, so I think it's possible, just a big stretch.

But the important thing as far as I am concerned is that we do not just walk away, not always anyway. Just because it is difficult technically to deal with, doesn't mean we just ignore it. That would be a real mistake. That does not mean expending vast resources on policing the net, there are other ways. The issue I have is that, yes, we can turn off a harasser, we can walk away. But that means we are acting against our own wishes, deliberately limiting our own freedoms. At some point we have to assert ourselves, or we will be pushed further into acting against our own desires.

It's a difficult line to draw, and this case is not a good one to illustrate the argument. But the principle is the same in real life or the internet (and unlike you I don't actually make that distinction), you have to assert your own right to exist and freedom to act against the people who try to limit it, whatever the context.

And maybe financial reasons was the **real** explanation, but that doesn't make too much sense to me either. We were going to buy an English player (English premium, most likely more than the 17 for Aquilani), and one who was looking for higher wages (he did end up going to Man City).

A computer monitor cannot harrass you... the fact that it can be used to display communications from others is entirely the end users responsibility.  If you're going to let pixels on a monitor offend you... thats your problem.

After a year and a half and purely based upon my working experience I got a scholarship to study a masters and since then I have started working for two start ups.

When I speak to younger folk today I get the impression that they either want to win pop idol or have a seat on the board of Goldman Sachs from day one and are not emotionally prepared for rejection. It's about knocking on doors, getting any experience and finding whatever silver lining there is in every role. Treat the early years of a working life as a graduate scheme. 

Although I am a long way from where I want to be, I have enjoyed the journey and the life experience it has brought me along the way. That is what people are interested in. I don't get asked about my A levels, just life experience.

I have had relative good fortune in my career and I know it's hard to get the first foot in the door but I didn't enjoy loading a dishwasher in an east London hospital being shouted at by a huge African lady but it gave me experience in 'managing workloads and taking ownership for meeting deadlines within my department'. I didn't like standing outside tower hill station at 5.30am handing out flyers for virgin gyms but it gave me experience in 'executing a front line marketing strategy.' when the concierge for my temp agencies building went on holiday I covered him for peanuts but got to meet ppl as they came in and out of the building and when he returned i was rewarded with a gig at an insurance company and then a bank.

the bottom line of my rant is nothing in life is free and there is no silver platter. At our age our grandparents were in muddy fields being blown up and they still managed to eventually acclimatise and establish careers.

true,sanity,cnty-scotland,"US (Formerly Edinburgh, London)","To give you an idea of the confusion that can sometimes occur when you move to another country, consider the sorry case of a female English radio presenter that moved to my (now) home town of Austin, TX.

A few years back on their morning show she and her American co-host were talking about how a very popular music festival here called Austin City Limits had turned into a bit of a mud-fest due to excessive rain.

During the conversation she suggested that they could ""go down to Home Depot and hire a wetvac to clean it up"".  There was shocked silence from her co-host and she was suspended for a week.

If you haven't spent much time in the US, you may be a little perplexed by this, until you are made aware of three key facts:

* Home Depot is a hardware store which, while it does let you rent wetvacs, is also a popular place to hire illegal Mexican immigrants for day labor

* ""Wet back"" is a very derogatory term for illegal Mexican immigrants (and sounds a lot like ""wetvac"" when you say it fast)

* In the US the term ""hire"" is never used in the context of renting equipment, it is only used to describe hiring a person to do a job

Of course, since the poor girl was obviously rather oblivious to these three facts, I thought it was a bit unfair to suspend her for it.",0,1316022680,null,0,false,0,c2jushl,t3_kf2j3,t1_c2jushl,t3_kf2j3,1427599765,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

Mind you, I'm not sure the UK does that badly in a statutory sense.

For sure we're a little bit behind the european mainstream but hardly radically so.

I wouldn't be surprised if the main factor in UK is simply cost of living. Whatever ultimate cause of that may be (high female workforce participation means two wages required for a home, high population density in many areas, high commute times, people working longer to support all this).

Suppose you waved a magic wand and increased everybody's income and reduced their working hours. It would be great in the short term, but in the longer term I bet house prices would increase to suck up everybody's spare income. 

It seems to me the best way forward is to greatly reduce house prices (by building more houses? By reducing demand? By having more social housing?), and have much better public transport, both of which would help reduce house prices, and eventually reduce the amount of money people have to earn to spend on their houses, which then means they have to work less.

If only they would be more like you, they could all (globally) gain employment and go on to create their own financial disaster one day, and blame it all on the next generation whose prospects they'll destroy in the process.

Every generation has a mix of people that work hard and those who don't. I doubt that changes much over time. If it was a root cause of unemployment though, then it was far worse in the past, because unemployment in the modern era (post 1980, say) is lower than it has ever been in the past. Could the excuse of state dependence have been used during the recessions, depressions and generally high unemployment in pre-war Britain?

The push to make Rose the greatest companion ever just became too much (that and the fact she never went away) made me like her less over time.

The Doctor is super-chummy with Donna, and lovey-dovey with Rose, but his relationship with Martha is much more like classic Doctor/companion relationship.

Some people give Martha crap (mostly for not being Rose) with her crush on The Doctor which isn't (and shouldn't be) returned. However, she realizes the relationship can never work (something Rose, Donna, and Amy don't seem capable of doing). The Doctor will move on without them, or lose them, at some point.

Unlike Rose and Donna who have to be taken away from The Doctor kicking and screaming (and crying), Martha is the only one who outgrows him and sets off on her own without before forced to leave. Donna forgets everything, and everything Rose does is to find The Doctor again. Martha is the only who consciously makes the choice to leave on her own.

Send it recorded delivery and state that unless you hear back from them within 21 days you will assume there are no grounds for this alleged debt, that you owe them no money and that all debts will be dismissed.

That doesn't remove any liability, but it should light a fire up their arses.

They probably need to take you to court to recover the money - without that a credit card collections agency has no standing (although university debts *might* be different) - and at that stage they need to present evidence that you owe them. This will probably be in terms of ""we say he owes us this"", but at that preliminary stage you can probably ask for a postponement so that you can have a think about it.

Your credit rating shouldn't be too seriously affected unless they get a County Court Judgement (CCJ) against you. I.E. the court case described above. You can get a copy of your credit report for £1. If your university debt is on there, I think you can write to them and ask for evidence; with credit card and bank debt you can ask for the ""original credit agreement"" (in which you normally give them permission to update your credit history) and if they can't find it then you can ask them to remove anything they've put on there (and they're obliged to comply).

I believe Amy and Rory are involved in creating the two alternative time traveling groups (Silence / Teselecta &amp; Justice Dept) as a result of their experiences with the Doctor.

I think the Ponds will/have eventually decide that Victorious does more harm than good and he needs to be checked.  They either directly make their own time machine or start a movement to develop one no matter how long it takes. The group involved in this undertaking might have a schism at some point and become two groups.  The Silence twists things (as only a religion can) and the Justice Dept goes all overboard with authority (Homeland Security much?).

Yes, pretty much. If your aunt put her house on the market, the estate agent would describe it as 3-bedroom (or 2½) and your aunt wouldn't say ""no, I don't want too much money for my house, it's only little, put it down as only 2-bedroom"".

However, all of that's got nothing to do with it. Council tax is assessed in bands, and your aunt's council tax will be exactly the same as the identical, same-sized houses in her street.

My mother had success in getting her bungalow (and I think that of one of her neighbours) into a lower band than some of her other neighbours, because those latter houses have access to their back gardens through gates which lead onto the pavement or a pathway. Odd things like that can affect the banding. Ideally there are some near-identical houses on the same street, and you can use small differences as your argument that your aunt's should get a reduction.

Also they'd have to contend with the cultural gender boundaries Western culture ingrains in one at birth. Oh and the previous 50 years of Doctor Who history and continuity.

Either this is the Tardis telling him that, he is just connecting the dots with time-period and placement but I would go with that he actually hears what they say.

While most humans are low level telepaths the Doctor actually have some higher level telepathic abilities and shutting out the Tardis auto-translation should not be a problem for him.
I would go as far as the Tardis know when to not translate for him. If he knows the language the Tardis just let him do his thing and kicks in where it can help. Since he have a telepathic bond with the Tardis I would guess it is a exchange between them about things like that.

And I do think the Tardis actually translate spoken gallefryeian so that lazy Time Lords can speak to other people without having to learn a new language. But for it to translate written there would be no real need since written gallefryeian is for the eyes of Time Lords. With their whole ""keep out of everything"" business I can imagen they did not make many friends out there in the galaxy that would need to read their written language. And what other good way is there to keep people from reading your instruction manual, unless you throw it in a super nova that is.

And for the Doctor to pick up a lot of different languages. I guess it helps to be him, he picks up new skills really fast. But it might have something to do with a underlying telepathic ability. He have been around, he can mostly identify what planet they are on and in what time period by just stepping outside the door. Which would mean he probably have been there before and have had a chance to pick up the language.

Let's say that the Doctor is a bit better then the best human being at learning new languages. Then he would need less then a week interacting with that language before getting the basic conversation, answering and asking questions. He connects the dots between human languages and that time reduces greatly for each new language.

Saturday (Hey Hey Hey)- Rock Night, Plays indie to heavy metal if your into that sorta thing.

Oceana: Same as the forum, apart from its fairly expensive from what i remember.

This whole controversy spawned around an image of the 10th doctor, where anyone who has watched the reboot would know that referring to him as ""Doctor Who"" is somewhat taboo. I could understand people questioning that image.

In the whole history of the show he has been ""The doctor"". Even if on occasion he has allowed himself to be called ""Doctor Who"" it is no more his name than John Smith.

Trent SU on a Saturday was also popular even with UoN students (although I'm not sure how far trent is from the subo campus.)

If you like a lot of alt/indie music, Joy Division, Arcade Fire and whatnot then I can highly recommend Bodega on Wednesdays, it's also a great gig venue.

The Doctor, Amy, and Rory land in Roanoke to find the settlers terrorized in the night, their population slowly disappearing. After a few gnarly scenes and theories The Doctor finally figures out it's the VN and tries to stop them but in doing so ultimately causes the deaths of said settlers. 

There are so many other ways the episode could go down, but this is a really great possibility to bring back a gnarly monster.

true,ljuki,sontaran,Sontaran,"Well, you got me...Martha is the ONLY single companion I dislike in the new series. And that includes the quasi-companions like Mickey. I liked MICKEY better than Martha. o_O

This has nothing to do with the fact that she fell in love with the Doctor. I mean, Rose did it and I liked her fine. My main problem with Martha pivots around two points.

- [She fell in love with the Doctor too damn fast.](http://www.urbanelephants.com/images/stories/rent-is-too-damn-high.jpg) Now, I don't know every episode by heart (yet) but I think it was already in the one with Shakespeare where Martha was like ""Ooooh, I like him but he doesn't notice me."" ...*what*? Woman, you have known this person for less than a DAY and you are still wearing the same clothing you were when you left with him. I know people bond with the Doctor quickly, but god damn it, there are limits, even to that. I could also tack on here that she trust the Doctor too damn quickly. Other companions usually question him in the early episodes but with Martha it was instantly ""No, he will come. I *know* he will come."" ...no you bloody don't, you haven't gotten to know him enough to claim that!

- She is a poorly written character. Now, I know, I know, she is supposed to be intelligent and tough, that's what they kept TELLING us by having Daleks scan her brain and declare she is highly intelligent. But we're not supposed to be TOLD what a character is like, we're supposed to be shown that. If you just look at Martha outside the fact that we're TOLD that she's a doctor and that we're TOLD that she is intelligent, her actions, remarks and reactions are no different from Rose's, Donna's or that of any other companion. She's a quick thinker? So were the others. She asks questions? So did the others. She reproaches the Doctor - good GOD, so did the others. In fact, nothing you could say was specifically MARTHA'S trait has had any impact on the plot of that season. You could've taken Martha out and replaced her with Rose or Donna and it would've been JUST THE SAME.

You might say I'm not annoyed with Martha personally, as much as with whomever wrote her character. She is like a scaffolding of a good character that the writers opted to fill by TELLING us what she was like all the time without actually SHOWING us any situations or reactions to support it.

EDIT: Oh, right! I will give Martha one point, though - up until Amy came along, I fancied her the most stunningly beautiful of all the new Doctor Who companions. :)

My favourite companion is another controversial one: Donna. I know a lot of people find her annoying, but I liked her because:

- Tate is a gorgeous, GORGEOUS woman. o_O

Why?

1. Since she'll be watching a lot of the Matt Smith stuff in the following weeks (unless she's completist) then it'll be best to expose her to each Doctor before you give her several of a certain Doctor in a row. It'll help break the concrete idea of one Doctor as only being the Doctor.

2. It's not uber hard sci-fi, but yet it has some great wibbly wobbly in it to underly the kind of awesomeness DW is capable of.

3. It doesn't require knowledge about the TARDIS or the Doctor being an alien...etc. You just know he's a time traveller, which is a nice ease in for the bit where you mention evil saltshakers and police boxes.

4. It's a plain good story, and if you start off with a Smith episode you'll spoil her in the way of special effects and direction..etc. One of my friends won't watch Eccleston because I started them off on Smith episodes.

After this I'd say ""Dalek"" to get Doctor 9 in there and educate her about the TARDIS and Daleks. It's also one of the best episodes for getting a feel for *who* 9 is.

Then the Eleventh Hour so she can see, well, 11. but before she watches Time of Angels/Flesh and Stone she has to see Silence in the Library/Forest of the Dead.

What the NOTW journos did was unethical **obtaining** of news. The way they presented it wasn't questioned.

Journalists regularly break laws and bend rules to get a story. You can question the ethics of news corp journos using crooked sources, and blame them for naivete for thinking it was business as usual (and this is to say nothing of the newscorp **executives** who authorised breaking the law). 

However all of that is different in that it deals with how a journalist gets their information. The way they bundle it into a story is different. And journalists can add their opinion, spin the story or do whatever, but if they fabricate information that's different.


**Consider these 3 scenarios**:


* A jouranlist gets information illegally

**I can identify that the information was obtained illegally, and I can impute motives and bad character on the journalists, but I can trust the information**

* A journalist writes a hit piece summary of an interview

**I can identify that the piece is furiously critical/unfair/biased , but have the intervieee's words as something objective. If I think the journalist is being completely unfair I can look elsewhere**

* A journalist writes a slanted article **and** fabricates quotes and facts

**I'm stuck. I literally am unable to separate facts opinions and analysis because the journalist has fused them all together.**

Imagine if someone started taunting  you about loosing a family memeber in war, and sent them vile messages, and kept harrasing you.  To me that is not just a shitty thing to do. It is bullying.  Its criminal when it crosses that line.

My view - express your opinion about an issue, but when you are taunting and harrasing others personally, and inciting,  then it becomes criminal.

Once that's done, the police have to convince the CPS to prosecute. The CPS often choose not to, either because a prosecution would not be in the public interest or they feel that they do not have sufficient chance of successful conviction.

Once those 2 hurdles are cleared, you then have to be found guilty either by a magistrate or a jury.

He also said that he thought the lecturers hated him and cut him off when he tried to speak (I didn't witness this but the lecturers could be pretty short with people). I think gender studies should be brought up to date- the myth of women as victims and men as violent brutes harms everyone. They should talk about more current debates around the inequality of child custody, and the reality of male victims of domestic violence, for example.

That said, I don't agree with everything in the article. To say that the definition of patriarchy is that men will dominate women is too simplistic, and we can't just start ignoring the existence of very real power inequalities that permeate societies. Sex is one of those divisions, just like class or race. Western scholars are living in a bubble where we argue about these things; the reality for the majority of the world is that women aren't that highly educated, they don't have the freedom to go to Uni or live on their own or even leave the house without an appropriate male guardian in many cases. I do agree with the notion of patriarchy (sex is just an essential division among humans that people will exploit for their own purposes, like everything else) but we need to move away from thinking that women are the victims of it and all men are the dominating aggressors. Patriarchy harms men too, by holding up old stereotypes about what it means to be a man (you don't cry and you're not gay, or effeminate), by benefiting the elite while using men as disposable soldiers to protect their interests in other countries, by belittling the experience of male survivors of rape or violence because 'men are strong, and those things only happen to weak people, ie. women.'",0,1316083813,null,0,false,0,c2k16eh,t3_kgdj9,t1_c2k16eh,t3_kgdj9,1427602912,39,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,39

&gt;In 1587, the English attempted to settle Roanoke Island. John White left the colony to return to England for supplies. He expected to return to Roanoke Island within three months. Instead, he found England at war with Spain, and all ships were confiscated for use of the war efforts. White's return to Roanoke Island was delayed until 1590, by which time all the colonists had disappeared. The settlement was abandoned. The only clue White found was the word ""CROATOAN"" carved into a tree.

And this is the part that gets left out:

&gt;Before leaving the colony three years earlier, White had left instructions that, if the colonists left the settlement, they were to carve the name of their destination, with a Maltese cross if they left due to danger. ""CROATOAN"" was the name of an island to the south (modern-day Hatteras Island), where a friendly native tribe was known to live. Colonists might have tried to reach that island. However, foul weather kept White from venturing south to search on Croatoan for the colonists, and he returned to England. White never returned to the New World. Unable to determine exactly what happened, people referred to the abandoned settlement as ""The Lost Colony"".

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt;I think gender studies should be brought up to date- the myth of women as victims and men as violent brutes harms everyone. 

It's not really a myth. Women have been victims of violent men on a large and socially acceptable scale, for centuries, across many societies.

Of course, I don't think that means it's fair to treat all men (or women) like victims or violent brutes. I do agree with the rest of your post on this. 

Men are also violent toward other men, possibly more often. And we do see women being violent to one another and to men (though it really is on a lesser scale).

Men are inherently more aggressive and violent and society needs to accept it and deal with it appropriately instead of trying to suppress it and pretend that it's only a few bad ones. 

I think that feminists will tend to concentrate on women's issues. I think that more men need to get into this 'gender studies' to even things out, it shouldn't be the official name for *feminist studies*. 

If you're calling it 'gender studies' rather than 'women's studies' then you damn well ought to be as objective and equal as you can be and univerisities ought to be using quotas to ensure there is male representation, as they do for male dominated areas. Equality in this area is perhaps more important than something like engineering since the conclusions drawn get extrapolated and used in wider society, whereas your ability as an engineer is probably not quite so dependent on your sex.

For so long equality has been seen in the light of women standing up against the evil men for their rights - and this really was necessary before women had the vote, right to an education, any kind of divorce or property rights, the right to not be raped within a marriage. In Western societies it now needs to move toward ironing out *all* equality problems so that neither men nor women get shafted.

Edit: something else I just thought of. I don't consider men to be all complete brutes because I know too many who aren't. I went through a university degree and work in a male dominated area, and I've always been treated well. Perhaps if hordes of women are going through these 'Gender Studies' courses, never actually getting to know many men, that in itself will skew their perceptions..",0,1316085268,null,0,true,0,c2k18q0,t3_kgdj9,t1_c2k18q0,t1_c2k16eh,1427602941,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

true,TragedyT,tardis,TARDIS,"I completely agree with your points on this subject, LazerBrain (can't help hearing Chewbacca's snicker every time I think the name). I don't feel ajleece has made any kind of coherent argument to support the assertions made in the topic.  If anything, the show has been far less illogical and deus ex-xy in the past two series than in the previous four.

However, I do think Curse of the Black Spot was a stinker of a show; the low point of an otherwise mindblowing series.  The most egregious part for me was the pathetic non-CPR administered melodramatically by Amy, with Rory randomly springing back to life ridiculously while the Doctor stood by impotently, clucking like a hen.  This in a Tardis full of futuristic technology, including magical brain-tumour dissolving pills.  Nothing in there for reviving a drowning victim?

Other than that my complaints are probably more debatable and general (well, apart from the case of the pirate who disappeared completely from a locked room without any explanation - that was just poor stuff). 

I felt the episode didn't spark as a story, with the Doctor sort of bobbing around coming up with theories and ideas, but not really doing much while people died around him.  His most decisive act, apart from blowing his nose, was to persuade everyone to attempt suicide as he was reasonably convinced that they wouldn't die.  That's not good plotting.

The pirates themselves seemed an uninteresting, unconvincing bunch, and it all seemed like lacklustre filler, as if the very idea of having pirates was all that was required.  Where was the adventure?  The pizazz?  42 minutes of cowering in cupboards isn't engrossing stuff.  It was just so... flat.

I can't provide a more expert dissection of this episode's failings than that, as it's the only one of Series 6 that I haven't had the energy to watch a second time.  Actually, this fact alone probably says a lot more than all my previous paragraphs of waffle.

If they permitted development on the edges of towns that are based on city density levels - ie, 20 people living on a plot of land that would normally be expected to be occupied by a single family, then you can build on green belt land without significantly affecting how much land is occupied.

While large houses are nice, I would expect a lot of people would be happy to live in a low rise 3-story block of flats occupying a small plot next to a field, and the locals would be happy to have 20 people move into an area without building all over that field.

You would also dramatically change the economics of village life as increasing the population with a tiny use of land would make local services such as shops/pubs/buses far more viable.

I agree that this was the case historically in the UK etc and that there are many areas of the world where this is still a problem. But I don't think it is that way in the western world any longer - am I right (asking people who have studied this)?

As such, I think the issue that Tom Martin is highlighting is that inequalities are still highlighted as being present that aren't, at least not for those of us living in the West. Of course it should be shown as being a very real problem for many societies in which women are effectively an underclass, but is it still proposed as being present *here*? I ask this because Mr Martin says

&gt; ""In a world which verbalises four times more sexism against men than it does against women..."".

This implies that the material is stating otherwise when it comes to the UK.

I think you omit to make the distinction too, although I have no doubt you realise the reality, as you write:

&gt; For so long equality has been seen in the light of women standing up against the evil men for their rights - and this really was necessary before women had the vote, right to an education, any kind of divorce or property rights, the right to not be raped within a marriage. In Western societies it now needs to move toward ironing out all equality problems so that neither men nor women get shafted.

You point out that the West doesn't have that problem any more, which would lead me to think that you think the issue is elsewhere and of course I agree. If I'm not being clear - I think that if you wrote the first part and didn't say this second part, people could take it to mean that women are *still* being oppressed in the West too.  
I think that's a very real problem though, when it comes to something like this topic. Although I would hope it's quite clear in material given on an academic course, outside of that we really need to be clear about *where* in the world we're discussing. 

I hope I'm making sense. Reading back over my comment I think I've come across as a little simplistic and as though I was criticising you. I wasn't, just commenting on a wider topic which I was able to demonstrate with a couple of things you wrote.

A small aside:

&gt; Men are inherently more aggressive and violent and society needs to accept it and deal with it appropriately instead of trying to suppress it and pretend that it's only a few bad ones.

I really think it depends where you are, how you grew up and how you were taught. But I'm quite the pacifist so I might be biased there. Unless you mean ""play fighting"" or similar?

After the hit and run murder of three Muslim men from Birmingham in the riots, I posted [this on r/UK raising the issue that I had seen *no* women](http://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/jfwae/has_anyone_seen_any_women/) on TV reports out on the streets or being interviewed after the event (note: everything was calm and peaceful). Bearing in mind one of the men was about to become a father: A voice over even said the following: ""He was expecting his first child."" I finally saw some women the funeral, but *very* few compared to the male mourners. 

My thread was downvoted to (below) zero, which I found very surprising. I got one comment response from someone who told me that how they live was nothing to do with me, which wasn't really helpful.

I had to attribute the downvotes etc to people assuming I was of an anti-Muslim ilk. I found that very frustrating, because the issue is not about Islam in totality but the way in which Islam can be used to treat women.

true,Hapax_Legoman,null,null,"In television *in America* it's even more strict. We have a writers' guild here that exists to resolve disputes about who contributed what to which production. It's great, because it makes everybody play by the same rules regarding who's entitled to which credit (and which tier of monetary compensation) and so on, but in order to comply with those rules you have to be very careful.

For example, in episodic television there's this idea of a spec script: an unsolicited screenplay using established characters and storylines that's submitted to the producers of some serial or other. It used to be true, decades ago, that a complete amateur with no writing credits at all could submit a spec script and have it be read, and possibly even bought. A number of high-profile TV writers got started that way. But this practice also caused a whole lot of problems. You get a spec script in the mail that includes some theme or other. You don't buy the script (because it's not any good, or what have you), but later you write an original script that happens to include the same theme, and *wham.* Before you know what hit you, you're in guild arbitration over who gets the story-by credit and the check that goes with it.

Some serials still accept spec scripts, but they have a Chinese-wall process internally to make sure nobody involved with the writing, including the producers, sees any of them until they're ready to be bought. On some productions, spec scripts don't even go to the same *building* as the rest of the production, because of the possibility that one could be left lying around and get picked up by the wrong person. If it ever comes to a dispute over credit (and payment), the writing staff has to be able to say with complete honesty that they never even saw the *title page* of the spec script in question.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt;To say that the definition of patriarchy is that men will dominate women is too simplistic

Yet it's exactly the way in which feminists have been using it for the past 50 years.

&gt; and we can't just start ignoring the existence of very real power inequalities that permeate societies.

The problem is though that if you look diparities between the genders in the first world, in the context of quatifiable areas that tend to be used as a measure of well being, such as:

education.

health 

chances of being unemployed.

chances of being homeless.
 
chances of committing suicide .

chances of ending up in prison.

Women always seem to be substantially better off.

Despite this, and despite women complaining about a lack of representation in government in the first world; We pay over 10 times the amount of money to social programmes for women as we do on social programes for men.

Yet the feminists are still there talking about *the patriarchy* and *male privilege*.

Still demanding more money for their *issues* and opposing movements who seek to provide men with help in the areas listed.

&gt;the reality for the majority of the world is that women aren't that highly educated, they don't have the freedom to go to Uni or live on their own or even leave the house without an appropriate male guardian in many cases

that's completely irrelevant, it's like when women bring up the notion that *women have been oppressed for thousands of years*. 

So What?

So now it's payback time?

So now it justifies attacking a generation of prepubescent boys who have been disadvantaged in almost every quantifiable way to their female peers? Because it's so *thuper empowering* for the baby boomers?

don't you think it's the feminists(even moderates like you) who need to stop ""ignoring the existence of very real inequalities that permeate societies""

true,Bobsutan,null,null,"&gt; Women have been victims of violent men on a large and socially acceptable scale, for centuries, across many societies.

MEN have been the victims of violent men orders or magnitude more than women. The argument that women should be the ones that get protected more so than men completely falls flat on it's face. All of these ""take back the night"" marches and laws like VAWA are institutionalized misandry. They protect women more than men despite women being a tiny percentage of the victims of all violent crime.  

&gt; And we do see women being violent to one another and to men (though it really is on a lesser scale).

This is the feminist cherry-picking filling your head. The actual reality, as discussed in [**this presentation**](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOu_BszChIE&amp;feature=results_main&amp;playnext=1&amp;list=PL1B32E01C0A996AC5
), shows that half, if not most, of all relationship violence is actually perpetrated by women (not to mention the majority of child abuse being at the hands of the mother). Other studies have also shown that lesbian couples have the highest rates of DV. 


&gt; Men are inherently more aggressive and violent and society needs to accept it and deal with it appropriately instead of trying to suppress it and pretend that it's only a few bad ones.

Men are the outliers of the species in pretty much ass aspects of life &amp; society. They're more violent, brilliant, risk taking, etc. Just the way it is. Dulling our nature in terms of culling violence has the tendency to dulling other aspects of masculinity. There's no better illustration of this than what's happening in our school systems. 

&gt; If you're calling it 'gender studies' rather than 'women's studies' then you damn well ought to be as objective and equal as you can be and univerisities ought to be using quotas to ensure there is male representation, as they do for male dominated areas. Equality in this area is perhaps more important than something like engineering since the conclusions drawn get extrapolated and used in wider society, whereas your ability as an engineer is probably not quite so dependent on your sex.

I agree, except for the quotas part. Quotas in an equal opportunity society doesn't foster equal opportunity at all, but equal outcome, and that's not equality at all.


&gt; In Western societies it now needs to move toward ironing out all equality problems so that neither men nor women get shafted.

This is why the civil rights movement has shifted in the last few years to correcting some oversteps caused by overzealous politicians pandering to special interests (feminist groups). Feminism used to be a force of social change, but it's shifted into being nothing more than a special interest group, and it's go the ear of a lot of politicians. If they're not challenged, and their oversteps correct, then things will continue to get worse for men and society as a whole. Yes the things you listed were valid issues, but things have been taken too far and are in dire need of correction.

Secondly, then you talk about issues in the first world and how women are not measurably better off there.

I also have some sympathy with the same argument applied to media studies, but that's just a bias of mine. I'm sure there are other people who would apply it to history of art, minor languages, obscure history degrees etc... and that's the problem with it. *Who says* whether something is worthy of study? I say me, obviously. You say you. What happens when we disagree on something?

I will be the first to deride Fraudulent New Age Bullshit and the overbearing influence that arts grads laughably ignorant of science, have on public discourse in this country. The trouble is that the way out of a lot of this bullshit, is through the pursuit and application of philosophy. The pursuit of reason. The philosophy of science *underpins* science. And (sadly) it's studied in the arts faculty!

Also, I expect you would acknowledge that arts - fine art, literature, music and so forth - are important to our cultural life, and our history. As such, they're legitimate areas for study. How can we say to someone ""OK, study *Mary Barton* but you're not to consider the social context in which the novel is set, or examine the role of women in early industrial societies...""

Which brings us back to gender studies. *Why not?* Half the population of this country have historically lived with different rights, different social status, different wages to the other half. If society is a reasonable subject for academic study, then it would be a bit odd to overlook the topic of gender.

What I suspect you're *actually* finding objectionable, is the political leanings that such courses have, and the sort of people that are attracted to them. Which is what the article was all about. The thing about such polarisation - in any branch of academia - is that *it is inherently unstable* and moderation is likely to be bought to bear. Thesis, antithesis, synthesis &amp; all that.

Boys are doing worse because *feminists* have demanded hundreds of programees for girls while denying any help for boys. This was of course done in the name of fighting the patriarchy and male privilege.

As such, they're legitimate areas for study. How can we say to someone ""OK, study Mary Barton but you're not to consider the social context in which the novel is set, or examine the role of women in early industrial societies...""

For the arts, I don't deny they're legitimate fields of study.  Rather, I deny that they should be funded by the public.  Historically, the arts have flourished when artists had to compete for private funding.  The Renaissance was almost wholly privately funded.  Masterpieces like the works of Palladio, Michaelangelo, Donatello, right the way through to the likes of Turner, and other Nineteenth Century giants were almost wholly funded by benefactors and private collectors.  Hell, even the likes of Shakespeare were all out hustling for private money.  Even today, there's an asymmetry in what art gets funded publicly.  Authors are almost always privately funded, from what I can see.  Why not the rest of the art world?

Fortunately the advent of public galleries - supported, admittedly, by private collectors too - have allowed the rest of us access to these things. (Well, if we're prepared to shell out for Vatican admittance etc. etc.) Yes, sometimes patrons commissioned public art works, but you could argue that the works' value was distorted by the sponsor's attempt at buying recognition.

I must acknowledge of course that there is, and has always been, a place for patronage. I don't think it's as cut and dried as you're making out though: for one thing, public arts funding enables artists from the other end of the social spectrum, and outside of the elite, to get a foot in the door. While some of the results are, to say the least, questionable, I think there's more vibrancy and less stagnation in art since it became a bit more... cosmopolitan (if that's the word?)

Yes, I suppose authors are funded by the sale of their books (plus a few govt. and charity-foundation-funded ""research tours"" thrown in). 

&gt;I'll just lay my cards out on the table: I don't think anything other than science, medicine and engineering should be funded publicly. Everything else should have to compete for private funding.

The subtext to that is ""because these things provide clear and tangible benefits to the public, and are therefore deserving of public money"".

It's reasonable. And one has to draw the line somewhere, so why not there? Personally, I take a less hard-line view about what constitutes a public benefit. I think a broad, (relatively) non-elitist arts establishment is a public asset. I think the galleries and museums I can enter for free are absolutely wonderful. I have doubts about entrusting the future of the free world to a bunch of people who studied Classics, but I acknowledge that a broad general education (including languages, humanities and arts) is actually rather important for people who are going to be in positions of responsibility. More important, arguably, than the ability to synthesise a protein. 

Perhaps more importantly I would rather that most of the arts lecturers I've encountered are safely tucked away being self-important in front of impressionable undergraduates, than performing heart bypass operations or designing aeroplanes.

Normally, the Doctor takes their companions to go la-dee-da across the universe, they visit bizzare places and timelines and have adventures. The episodes focus not so much on the Doctor and his companion(s) as much as the stories of the locations and characters they encounter. As the season reaches its middle and starts leaning into the finale, little loose ends are tied and things gradually begin to build up to the main plot, focus more and more on the Doctor and companion and, eventually, the climax of the season.

This time round, however, it seems that all the adventures and the Doctor-companions relationship is being sacrificed in favour of developing the main (River Song-related) plot line. 

Nearly every episode, regardless of where, how and why it had started off, would end up being centered around the Doctor and Amy/Rory/River, and I'm not ENTIRELY sure whether I like it or not yet. The storyline now feels much more compact, most of it being tied to this small, four-member unit of characters.

http://www.csulb.edu/~mfiebert/assault.htm

A collection of 280+ empirical, peer reviewed research and studies on violence inflicted on men by women (the overwhelming conclusion is that females are at least just as violent as men, if not more)

http://news.bbc.co.uk/newsbeat/hi/health/newsid_7878000/7878698.stm

Although this only covers the younger generation, ""6.4% of men in England and Wales between the ages of 20 and 24 say they were victims [of DV] over the last year, compared with 5.4% of women"". Note it does say that women are abused overral, but this brings a whole load of other issues. Reports of male DV in older generations is very under-reported, as older males generally fear humiliation and damage to their reputations by doing so. Also, in domestic violence situations, males are more likely to be punished than the aggressors, and females less likely to be prosecuted or severely punished: 

http://www.canadiancrc.com/Newspaper_Articles/David_McCrae_Women_Forgotten_Murderers_01FEB04.aspx

""About 1300 child murders took place in the US last year. About 500 perpetrators were non-parents, roughly divided between men and women. Of the rest, only 30 (!) were fathers. In other words, mothers were more than 25 times more likely to kill their progeny than fathers""

However, domestic violence support for females heavily outweighs that for males; anti-DV campaigns tend to focus on female abuse, and often use examples of males on females, despite close to equal rates. For example, http://thisisabuse.direct.gov.uk/ The videos, targeted at younger people- despite the equal rates of occurrence as mentioned before- all feature males as being the abusers.",0,1316098274,null,0,false,0,c2k2c6w,t3_kgdj9,t1_c2k2c6w,t1_c2k1eyf,1427603465,13,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,13

I think I made a point of saying that I have been fortunate and I am like everybody else in that detaching my experiences from my worldview is not a straight forward task. However, I think in parts some of your post gets a bit carried away in it's interpretations.

My base argument is that economic climates are consistently changing on a day to day basis where there is always a black swan game changer which should be factored in. However, like the defunct risk models employed in financial institutions, political analysis tends to take a static, linear approach which fails to appreciate irrational behaviour.

A famous quote by Keynes is 'when the facts change I change my mind, what do you do sir?' 

I believe the current economic crisis has been caused by in a best case scenario, short term greed and collusion between political and financial institutions and in a worst case scenario a deep rooted agenda for social change instigated by the same players. Both positions being executed against an uninformed and preoccupied star gazing counterparty, us the public.

Using the base understanding that there is always someone out there looking to fuck me over as the keystone of my motivation when I wake up each morning, I have placed zero trust in social contracts, political claims and corporate assurances. If I have to I have no problem with pulling pints, handing out fliers or loading dish washers again. It will hurt my pride a bit but at least I will still be standing. An old adage is 'the Market can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent'.

However, as you say unemployment is much lower than it was in the past and in fact we have a surplus of jobs, all be it bottom of the ladder jobs, but the fact we import such a high level of immigrant workers says something. Our economy is also much more diverse than it was in past decades, millionaires can be made overnight off the back of an Internet fad. We all have instant access to a global Market and unlimited knowledge in our homes which is a vast difference to the pre thatcher days when Britain went cap in hand to the IMF and the economy stalled.

In my humble opinion, I believe that despite the bullshit swamp around the world, we in this country at least have an unbelievable advantage in life, we have free education and free health care. Things which others would literally kill for. Things which weren't even guaranteed when our grandparents were fighting in fields oversees. The bottom line is when life gives you lemons, you can either suck on them or make lemonade.

But in retrospect a lot of the things she said about men in the course of her ""teaching"" were unacceptable and she would have been terminated on the spot if she was a guy saying that about women.     

The most ironic thing is that she constantly complained that men ""hated women"" while constantly re-enforcing negative stereotypes and making it fairly evident that was her stance again men.    

I dropped that class as soon as I could. It was also fairly obvious that more help was available to the female students and in general they assisted one another during group activities.    

PS - In retrospect I don't regret dropping psychology anyway. It is a pseudo-science. Very few of the pivotal experiments that the entire profession is built on can be repeated (often for ethics concerns). A lot of what we learned seemed to have no basis in scientific fact, and we instead relied on the reputations of those who originally thought up these bat-shit insane theories.     

PSs - Contrast that with Sociology which while a very similar subject actually deals almost exclusively with statistics and goes to great pains to attack the strengths of the subject's own understanding.

Where two timelines end the same way each time, resulting in an endless loop where timeline ""A"" ends in timeline B, and timeline B ends in timeline A, where ""A"" and ""B"" are in fact nothing alike and do not change.

But even this assumes that the timelines will eventually repeat. I'll try to think of a good analogy...

Your vision of timelines assumes that eventually there will be equilibrium.   Like, say if you're talking fractions, a very simple model with only 10 possibilities per place. Each value, 0-9, is a different timeline

A regular timeline would be just a decimal that ends. Like 4/5. It's .8. Period. It's not complex. 

But what about a stable time loop? If 8/11, you'd end up in .888 repeating, where eight goes on forever. Or, in our timeline analogy, a situation where a timeline with time travel ends up in itself. It keeps going. (Like Blink)

In your situation, you're thinking like if you divided 1 by 6, you'd end up with 0.166 repeating, right? There will eventually be a situation where the digit is repeated. Or, in our timeline analogy, where there is one time line, which leads to another timeline, which leads to another timeline, which eventually ends in a timeline that can lead to itself. (I think in your case you're thinking of a larger leading decimal, like say .12379871232222222 where the ending 2 is repeated, but lazy right now)

However, there could be situations like, 10/11, where it ends with .90909090909 repeating, where there are two which are different, but alternate. A timeline which ends in a completely different timeline, which loops back to the original time line. This is stable, but less so (Or the loop could be longer, like 5/7 where it goes .714285714285 forever. Still the same result though)

Or even cases like an irrational number, like pi, where, in fact, it never repeats. Goes always, and never ends. One timeline results in another timeline results in another timeline results in another timeline and so on. (yes in this situation I only gave 10 possible timelines, 0-9, and this is where the analogy breaks down, but whatever). It never repeats, and it never ends.

I have no idea where imaginary numbers come into this. I don't want to

* Level One: SJA - lighthearted, teaches you a lesson, you feel happy at the end.
* Level Two: DW - an adventure ensues every episode, with you along for the ride. Your emotions are churned back and forth, and you're taught lessons about life that you possibly couldn't handle as a child. In the end, though, you learn to understand the decisions the Doctor makes are difficult, and terrible, but sometimes necessary.
* Level Three: TW - You're shown the darker side of the effects of alien existence on Earth, the more realistic, grittier side effects of the Doctor's travels, and what goes on while the Doctor prances around in space while humanity deals with alien presence the best we can. Dark ideals are practiced, and tough decisions are made, and horrible things happen. Sometimes, more often than not, TW episodes end on a down note, and normally with people dead.

also, i may be mistaken but as far as i am aware blackpool isnt considered a hub of any sort for any type of industry aside from rock and regional fun fairs. 

if the young graduate were in say blackpool and wanted to move into the finance, law, media, retail etc etc, then i would say that it is worth moving to glasgow, edingburgh, leeds, manchester, birmingham or london etc and take a rubbish job and shit flat as a short term stop, just cover yourself rent wise and then go in hard on the offensive and do anything to get the foot in the door on the next rung up the ladder

i think you have completely missed my point about minimum wage jobs, they are they like a buoy to keep your head above water whilst you swim to shore. job can stand for just over broke and is different to a career but employers are reluctant to give you a career if they see that you can even be trusted at the most basic level to carry a box from A to B or put a liquid in a glass and give it to somebody in exchange for some shiny pieces of metal.

a small percentage of our country works on the jobs for the old boys basis where people get good jobs doing not much getting paid a lot cos of who they are regardless of ability and experience, its fucking BS, but in the short term what can be done. being pragmatic is realising that we aren't that person so everything we get will have to be fought for. we work hard and give chances to others who have proved themselves when the opportunity arises.

correct, i dont have a young family. i would like to and within the next year i expect to be well down that route but my gf and i took the decision that it would be irresponsible to bring a child into the world whilst we werent in a proper position to support it and provide security.

i also dont go out and drink with my friends as much as i would like to. infact it upsets me quite a bit but in the big picture, i have an objective and by spending 100 a week on booze isnt going to get me there

That's one way of looking at it. As far as I'm concerned it's a completely moronic way of looking at it, but it's certainly one way.

I was trying to raise a conversation on the subject. I didn't realise there was a list of things that can't be spoken about just because someone happened to have died.

&gt; Maybe you got downvoted because it was tasteless?

It's hard to think of a response to that, so I'll just smash my face into desktop in despair. Did you actually read anything I said or did you decide: ""People must have downvoted for a reason"" and so come to the crappest conclusion you possibly could?

Consider this scenario: Deaths in hospital have found to be higher in poorer inner cities.  

""Is this because people below the poverty line tend to eat much less healthily than those elsewhere?""  
""Downvote. You're using people's deaths to make a political point. That's tasteless.""

Please tell me how that example is different?

Student Nights:
Monday: Oceana - lots of rooms in the club, each different music, Drum&amp;Bass room, RnB room, cheesy/90's room, main chart music room etc...

Tuesday: Market Bar - usually expensive but Tuesdays is pretty good prices on spirits and mixers, Mkt Bar is a small place with good seating area though too loud to talk whilst sitting with friends. Not my favourite bar, I will usually go a cocktail bar if I go out on a Tuesday (Orange Tree, CocoLounge, FatCats, CocoTang etc)

Wednesday: Crisis at rock city, and Gatecrasher - Rock city is very popular, and good night, gatecrasher is dance/trance/DnB club.

Thursday: Forum - Cheap drinks, mostly good music, gets busy around midnight, good night out here!!

Friday: Ocean (different from Oceana) - good night for fancy dress nights and laughs, varied music but drinks expensive.

All nights: many cocktail bars and pubs, my fave's mentioned above.

true,canada432,null,null,"Actually, of the new doctors Eccleston was both my first and least favorite. When Tennant took over I hated it at first, but I loved the added quirkiness that Tennant brought in. Eccleston could be serious sometimes and hilarious and happy at some times, but he didn't have that quirkiness. Tennant I felt took away some of the darkness and replaced it with a bit of the fast talking train of thought speech that makes me like the doctor. 

However, I honestly think Matt Smith is my favorite of the new doctors. Not a real popular opinion I know, but here's my reasoning. Eccleston didn't have the quirks, and he always seemed kinda distant like he was trying to remain unattached. Tennant became personable and added in the quirkiness, but the whole run there was just this underlying depression. Even when he was happy it seemed like he was trying to mask how depressed he was. Smith takes the quirkiness to the next level. He's so carefree and fun-loving, but don't piss him off. You get these flashes of fury where even without seeming all that menacing he can scare the shit out of you. You just listen to him and look at him and you know that this guy is capable of wiping out entire civilizations, but doesn't only because he chooses not to. He brings back some of the darkness of the 9th doctor, but it isn't always present. You just get these brief moments of rage.

And in all parts of the world some of them are like that. So my point was that, before feminism helped correct such things, women were abused for men's advantage.

You then said: maybe that's more reflective of how the feminists view men than how most men actually are. The relevance of this seems to that you're saying be that most men wouldn't want to abuse women like that, for their own advantage. Or that men weren't really getting an advantage in the past that they've lost now. But against that I (and feminists) point to all the ways men have acted in the past, when they could, and in some parts of the present, when they can, and all the advantages they've enjoyed. The fact that most Western men are nicer now is partly due to feminism, both in its effects on men, and in the power it's given women.

erlier i said this:

&gt;The actual egaitarian things, like letting women work I think is actually a plus for most men. Not many men today really want to keep a housewife, they'd rather not have that responsibility.

So evidently i don;t think everything feminism did was bad..

now you're saying this:

&gt;feminism helped correct such things, women were abused for men's advantage.......The fact that most Western men are nicer now is partly due to feminism, both in its effects on men, and in the power it's given women.

So what?

If it weren't for Mussolini large parts of Italy today would still be thrid world, malaria infested swamps.

Does that mean that his other actions or his ideology ought to be endowed with an impunity from criticism?

Feminists love explain in great hyperbolic detail the bad things that men have done to women. i.e.

http://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/kgdj9/you_cant_deny_it_gender_studies_is_full_of/c2k4g2u

evidently you see this as being very important, why is that?, it obviously doesn't have all that much to do with politics today, neither of us were alive back then so i can't see it really having affected you personally, and i'm presuming you do not believe this endows feminism with impunity so why are you suddenly bringing up all that baggage out of the blue.

true,widgetas,null,null,"&gt; Turning someone's death into a debate about gender issues which had NOTHING to do with his life or death is just tasteless.

I'm not going to give the satisfaction of thinking you have won this little discussion, or have a valid point that I can't counter, by swearing at you. But you should take it as read. You are speaking utter, *utter* tosh. What must I do to convince you? 

You do realise that the media were talking about their deaths (plural by the way, it was three people not one) in relation to the riots? How dare they! How dare they turn their deaths into debate of any kind!

This is a wider issue - how many Muslim women from (any) community do you generally see giving comment on a Muslim issue?

It's not tasteless as the issue isn't to do with them, as I said before. Their deaths are irrelevant to this whole debate but were the starting point for me to really notice this problem. But the issue was set off by the fact that these men died - I doubt I would have struck a chord with me had I not heard and (not) seen what I did. Of course it could have been *anything* in the area - it could have just been the riot and the subsequent media coverage of that area of Birmingham. But it was because there was coverage of one of the victim's family and friends that I did notice, particularly when they made no specific reference to one of the murdered mens' wife. I'm an honest person - I don't lie about where I get my 'inspiration' (as it were) from particularly when it doesn't matter!

Is my point in any way rude to the dead men? Did I say *they* were misogynistic or cruel to their wives/girlfriends etc? No, not at all. I didn't make any comment about them whatsoever, apart from to detail how I noticed the issue. 

&gt; There is absolutely a list of things you don't discuss when someone dies. 

Where is this list? I think I missed the memo. Is it given to us in a folder of ""Pointless rules on 'Offense': Why some people should grow a thicker skin and how some people will talk a good deal of rubbish and think they have a valid point""?

Although it's not at all relevant (because this issue *isn't* about the dead men) I'm guessing you're one of the ""You shouldn't speak ill of the dead."" brigade, right?

By the way how long does that memo say you can't talk about X after someone dies? Are you allowed to discuss their deaths at all? Are you allowed to discuss a topic that they quite enjoyed? Are you allowed to talk about someone they knew? What about someone with the same name?

No, I'm serious - All these arbitrary bullsh- erm... I mean arbitrary decency rules are new to me.

Can you talk about a political point (that has nothing to do with the deaths) within earshot of someone who comes from the same city as the deaths occurred?

What if I accidentally say ""Houses of Parliament"" a month later when I'm standing in the same road as where the murders took place?

true,koltra,null,null,"Men and women interact with each other in certain ways. We both (I assume) want to ensure that they way they interact is as mutually beneficial and fair as possible: that your prospects in life are not determined by your sex, and so on. So we need to find out how they interact today, how they came to interact in the way they do, how we'd like them to interact, and how we can get them to interact in beneficial ways. So for example, if we were trying to decide what standards of sexual fidelity men and women ought to be held to (the same? different? how?), it would become important to find out what men and women's natural proclivities in such matters were, look at evidence from the past about how happy men and women were under varying expectations of fidelity as seen in different cultures and times, and how they had reacted to different expectations.

Or to make up an obviously over the top example. What if there were a possibility that the reason men had abused women in the past was that they were just biologically constructed so as to do so? (And maybe women so designed as to take the abuse.) And the only reason men didn't currently abuse women to the degree they did in the past was that the current laws and mores about how to treat women constrained them to be nice. Then it would be important to study the past to find out if this were the case or not, and how to prevent it and so on.

Or another example. When we study the history of universal suffrage, we talk a lot about how in the past the rich abused the poor by preventing them from voting. We worry that if they could, they'd do so again. We look at the past and try to identify what it was about the 19th century that meant that rich people could deny the vote to poor people and still feel okay about it. We want to make sure that it doesn't happen again, so it's important to find out why it happened in the first place, and why rich people now don't ever say they want to take the vote away from poor people.

It's odd that you say ""out of the blue"".

But basically, an N-jump becomes stable despite the paradox because the timeline can continue on, whereas the infinity loop and sawtooth snap are both unstable because they repeat forever and time can't progress past the moment of time-travel paradox. If you sawtooth for a while but eventually hit upon a version that works, that becomes the only version and you N-jump happily onward into the future.

I'm remembering what this argument was over now, whether the events in 'Time' were due to an iterative process, and the issue was 'well how did the first group know what to do and what happened to them' and my answer was 'no they're the same people, the events only happen once, it's just there's a loop of information rather than people' like in Blink.

The Eleventh Hour gives you a pretty good indicator of what kind of Doctor he is, so you should have a pretty good idea of what to expect from Smith by the end of his first episode.

This is going to sound harsh and mean and whatnot, given your racial handicap (these are more jokes than insults, btw. unless you're a girl, in which case I apologize. Youre not a girl, are you?), but grow some thicker skin and a decent coping mechanism. I am actually concerned that you're taking this to the ass so hard, its a bit unhealthy.

I know how crude I sound on the net at times, ESPECIALLY since I've decided to be more ""casual"" in this encounter. I'm bored with stuffy bullshit passive-aggressive niceness, what can I say. You need to learn that we aren't all Canadian, and taking the ""higher road"" like you're trying to makes you look a little petty and anal. If you're at where you say you're at, just walk away from it. It's that simple my friend. It is NEVER a good idea to get distracted and start calling people's behavior out, at that point you aren't making any relevant points and are actually weakening your position through inaction. It's exactly how republicans have controlled American media-focus for so long.

Anyway, there aren't any spoilers in this title. Seriously. Its way too cryptic and doesn't outright give any major plot points. Red waterfall is a minor detail, not a major point. Barring any sort of moffucking of course. 

In other words, if you haven't seen tgww you won't get the joke, making this post largely irrelevant to you if you have a decent handle on your own sense of curiosity. It's that simple, you are responsible for spoiling yourself. Don't start reading something you aren't familiar with  in a doctor who subreddit/forum/meeting places for internet weirdoes if you're trying to avoid spoilers. It's not like the text is going anywhere, and you have a full month to respond.

But since you likely don't think Ive answered your question about spoilers in the title yet, and even if you do Id like to put this in plain English anyway: I think they are unnecessary in this case since the title deals with a single episode and isn't revealing in an obtuse manner. 

I think they are unnecessary in a general self post since anything can be spoilered after the title, assuming there aren't obvious spoilers in the title. A spoilered title example: OMG I can't believe the doctor closed the door on old pond!

Or if you want a simpler rule: the first fifteen minutes are generally fair game. Nothing happens but setup and introduction in the first act.

My beef is that people come into threads and whine about spoilers when if they had used even an ounce of common sense they would realize that there are OBVIOUSLY spoilers in here. And then there are those who don't want other people to be spoiled, hypothetical people that didn't speak up because they don't exist. It's kind, but it's misguided. It's like painting a city pink because, hey, girls like pink! You haven't considered how the boys are feeling about it. And that makes such behavior just as inconsiderate as spoiling an episode for someone.

Ultimately, all Im saying is that it is up to you to keep yourself spoiler free, because I couldn't give two shits about a third party listening in when Im having a conversation about one of my favorite tv series.

This is not to say I won't be right there with you when somebody is being a dick and spoiling things. I'm just not an extremist, Im not somebody who avoids the preview at the end of the show because I think it ""spoils"" me. Stop being lame.

I don't give a shit about the piling on, your heritage, where you lived last summer or how upset you are.

true,canada432,null,null,"I both agree and disagree with you on Moffat's influence. I love the story being all tied together. However, I don't' like it when so many entire episodes are dedicated to it. Its awesome when the stuff is hinted at in stand alone episodes. Like how S5 started out with episodes where you'd just happen to see the crack in places. That was one aspect I liked about Eccleston's season, despite half of it being attrocious. Bad Wolf followed them through the entire season, but it was never a major part of the episodes until the end. 

I also like River in standalone episodes. Having her pop up in the library, then appear so many episodes later was awesome. Its the little foreshadows where you forget about it and then suddenly BAM, its actually important. Its great when its just part of a single episode story rather than the episode is dedicated to progressing the main story. Its one reason I didn't like LKH that much. It had its moments, and it was nice to fill in the story, but its like reading one chapter from a novel rather than a short story. AGMGTW, while I enjoyed certain aspects of it greatly, annoyed me for that aspect, too. Certain scenes were so cool they made me giddy, but there's no way I could show that episode to anybody unless they've literally watched at the very least all of S5 and 6. 

Now, The Time of Angels / Flesh and Stone. That could be its own story, and the focus with River was perfect. It wasn't overwhelming background, she was just another character. Somebody who had never watched before could enjoy that episode and appreciate that she's super important but we don't know why, and that's okay because we're not supposed to know why. Its also not really that important WHY she's important, because the story isn't focusing on her.

true,TX1138,pertwee,Pertwee,"After Let's Kill Hitler, it was made obvious that River/Mels was woven into Amy/Rory's timeline a great deal more than the Doctor had anticipated when he went searching for her in the first place. 

Before the whole 'Mels' debacle, there was a whole portion of River/Melody's early life that was uncharted. There was no way River was going to tell them what happened to her, but there was always hope that post-orphanage River was found by the Doctor and brought back to her parents.

However, once they discovered that post-orphanage River had gone straight to her parents in Leadworth and integrated herself into their timeline, there was nothing further they could do; at this point in time she was now a fully-grown adult with her own personality and memories and would no-doubt oppose any changes to her past, no matter how well-intentioned they may be.

To add to the ever-growing list of problems, it seems that Mels had played a critical part in bringing Rory and Amy together. Removing Mels from their lives by saving the post-orphanage baby would likely result in Mels never having been born in the first place. As shown in TGWW, the Doctor is very much unable to maintain the intricacies of these types of paradoxes, even with the TARDIS.

Finally, there's the element that always seem to be overlooked in this matter; the fact that the Doctor loves River Song. Of all the people in the universe, he is the one who would be most against rewriting her timeline, as he no doubt recalls how strongly she reacted when the Doctor suggested rewriting their timelines in *Forest of the Dead*. Saving Melody would rewrite not only her timeline, but also his. All those future moments with River would never happen; an entire time-bending relationship rewritten in the blink of an eye.

All in all, everyone has an overt interest in not saving the baby; including River/Melody herself.
