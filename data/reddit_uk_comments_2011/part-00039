Omega was one of the first Time Lords, who created the Eye of Harmony, the black hole that used to power all TARDISes. However, Omega was trapped in an antimatter universe, and was unable to escape on his own. Even when the Third and Second Doctor offered to help, they realized that Omega's body has wasted away, and his physical form was only manifest due to Omega's will.

true,jooes,mcgann,McGann,"I've been looking at Sonic Screwdrivers a lot lately for some reason, and I figured it'd be pretty cool to actually make one someday. I figured the older ones would be significantly easier to make, so I downloaded Google Sketchup to make a quick blueprint of the Fourth Doctors sonic screwdriver with some dimensions I found online... One thing led to another, and it's now 3D. 

Although I've done tons of 2D stuff before with AutoCad, this is the very first time I've used this Sketchup program, and the very first time I've ever done anything in 3D, so I'm pretty proud of myself right now. So I figured, ""Fuck it, might as well share it with the world"", so there it is.

Here's a link if you want to download it: http://www.mediafire.com/?l8p3b3r2w677zza

I did a lot of guessing though, and I'm almost certain it's not even close to the original as far as dimensions and stuff goes... And there were quite a few times where I almost called it quits. Took me forever to figure out how to make things round and the whole ""follow me"" command. And I almost didn't put the bevel or the groove part on it either, but I figured that I might as well go all the way. That's as accurate as I'm going to get...

Also, if you do download it, you can kind of see my progress as I went from 2D to 3D to adding details, etc... I for sure didn't do things the best way or the right way, I guessed my way through most of this... If I were to make it again, it would definitely take me a *lot* less time...

I think you're right about sleepless nights but I think this isn't restricted to journos. It's clear that the police are implicated to some degree as are some senior politicians. Labour/Blair I also agree probably have a lot to hide but luckily for Labour *right now*, Blair is history. Even if he is outed as being the worst political participant in this whole sorry mess, it's unfortunate that his past actions likely won't have as adverse an impact on Labour as Cameron's can on his party.

There is a lot of reverberation at the moment, so much so that the facts/outrage ratio is in danger of confusing the whole issue beyond resolution.

I think that the number of people ultimately implicated in this could be beyond what can be easily dealt with by an enquiry and a few resignations. I'm worried that a lot of things still seem to be allegations, too.

No, thats batman. When you are stopped by a police officer you do actually have to give your name and address if asked for it and if they reasonably suspect that you are lying, you can be arrested. This device should completely eliminate the risk of you being arrested despite telling the truth. Surely this is a good thing?

Of course theres a massive slippery slope here, its not something that the police should routinely carry, but it should be something that can be requested from the station to solve a little impasse.

true,ChrisHansensVoice,english,The Geordie Schooner,"**meeting adjourned, someone hit murdoch with a plate of shaving foam** - when asked by the BBC Political Editor why he did it he responded ""I cannot comment as I am part of an ongoing police investigation.""

Murdoch's starting now:

* 
They've just been told that they're not allowed to start with an opening statement, but are allowed to submit it in writing.

* 
James Murdoch apologises for victims of voicemail interception on behalf of NI - says it will never happen again.


* 
Rupert Murdoch says ""most humble day of my life""

* 
James: not accountable for misleading parliament in 2009, didn't know about evidence that has come up recently

* 
phone hacking does not meet the expectations of quality of NI

* 
Rupert seems utterly silent, james is the only one talking

* 
James says he was not involved in NI at the time most of the phone hacking was going on

* 
NI did not lie to the select committee in 2008/09. James believes that none of the executives knew about illegalities within News International (specifically News of the World)

* 
James: sympathise with the committee with their frustration

* 
James: dodges a question about *who* was involved with phone hacking

* 
News International is investigating widespread illegalities in NI/News of the World

* 
the investigation will hand over police either pro-actively or in response to police request.

* 
NI will aide the police

* 
James has no knowledge and no evidence (that I'm aware of) that resigned execs had any idea of the phone hacking. 

* 
Question directed to Rupert Murdoch about truth and wrong-doing. ""Who lied to you Rupert Murdoch""

* 
avoided answering

* 
R.M: no one at NI investigated Rebecca Brookes about paying police. Says that NotW is &lt;1% of News International, more than 50,000 professionals. ""I only employ people I trust to run my companies""

* 
R.M: none of my staff told me about the blackmail in the Max Mosely case. This is the first I have heard about this.

* 
Rupert is dodging questions, passing them off to his son, even though the questions are specifically about things *he* has said to the NY Times

* 
Murdoch admits that he knows *very* little about his UK newspapers

* 
James really wants to talk, the committee wont let him

* 
Rupert: was not informed about payments made to Taylor and Clifford (this is the first time I've heard of it)

* 
James: my father was made aware of these payements in 2009, out of court payements are not reported to Rupert Murdoch, it is the responsibility of the local chiefs of staff, and not that of the CEO of a global country.

* 
Rupert: Shocked appalled and ashamed of the millie dowler case.

* 
rupert: My Son is the only person who can answer most of these questions

* 
James is being told that his father is responsible for corporate governance, and therefore the blame lies with him.  The committee will get back to James after the course of questioning on Rupert is finished.

* 
no one was fired in april because NI couldn't find the people in the company. Most of the people who committed the wrongdoing had left the company by april.

* 
Mr Murdoch ""why did you kill NotW before firing Rebecca Brooke""

* 
rupert's response: most of the people who have been displaced at NotW have been found jobs in other parts of NI, we have shut the company because of the criminal activity, no longer have trust amongst our readers.

* 
Rupert: I am aware of PI's being used, unaware that it was illegal.

* 
I would introduce an investigation and work with the police if there is more evidence of illegal Private Investigation.

* 
to rupert ""why did you enter the back door of no.10 when Mr Cameron was appointed""?

* 
answer: "" Because I was told to... I was asked could I please come in the back door""

* 
I was invited for tea to congratulate Mr Cameron. 

* 
""I was taken through the back door by Mr Brown on numerous occasions"" [crowd laughed]

* 
RM: ""I never imposed pre-conditions on a government getting support from my papers""

* 
""we have seen **no** evidence of 9/11 hacking scandals. I **cannot** believe that this happened in america, there is **no** fbi investigation. I will commission an investigation if there is any evidence of this""

* 
james: what happened at NotW was wrong.

* 
working with police to find the wrongdoing and convict them as necessary. set up appropriate thrid party compensation parties are set up.

* 
Rupert: I am not responsible for the NotW, the people I worked with and above are responsible, people that I trusted

* 
Rupert: unsure if bribes went through appropriate tax authorise

* 
james: all of our finances are transparent, tax compliance is an important priority of NI.  I am unsure of our contractors. ""we take financial regulations transparently"".

* 
James: I cannot confirm/deny if News Corp is under investigation of HMRC, or foreign financial bodies.

* 
Rupert: son and I, and Ms Brookes decided to close NotW [discussion below]

* 
was not a commercial decision to close NotW

* 
James: out of court settlement to Mr Taylor was a part of the 2007 trial. paid on the advice of the companies legal team - as NI was going to lose the case if litigated.

* 
within the authority of NI (UK) to decide to pay these sums (that rupert didn't know about)

* 
James: I was in charge of NI Europe/Asia

* 
other directors get budgets for legal fees.

* 
takes several millions before legal fees are made known to the board.

* 
NI sees it as customary to seek out of court settlements, unsure of the worldwide settlement bill.

* 
q. ""how is it possible to pay people without involcing them?""

* 
James: it if customary for all finances to be recorded, and should be invoiced.

* 
James: I do not have knowledge of anything but money being used to remunerate on behalf of NotW hacking victims.

* 
Rupert: each newspaper has an internal financial manager, no reporter has authority to pay money on their own

* 
James: every member of NI recieves a pamphlet of a code of conduct (""it's not very big"" &lt;--ver batim)

* 
Rupert: I am unaware of any transgressions (specifically hillsborough), this country has a wide verity of voices and I am sure that there are headlines that often give offense.

* 
James: we will think more thoughtfully about our ethics, and code of conduct. Including what sort of governance will be used. This is a good thing for the country and all parties involved.

* 
have set up a management committee, reports to the independent directors of NI global publishing board, manages how we coordinate with the judicial enquiries we're involved in. 

* 
James: we need to think more about journalistic ethics.

* 
Rupert: this country does greatly at having a transparant press, which is sometimes an inconvenience to people, but the nation is better for it.

* 
there is no decision to have a News International Sunday newspaper.

* 
this is not our priority at the moment.

* 
priority is to get the problems we have just now fixed.

* 
James: if we knew earlier in the year what we know now, we would have done significantly more than we did.

* 
I was aware that the case involved the criminal act of phone hacking in 1st half of 2008

* 
I did not get the advice from legal teams, simply from people who had talked to legal teams. 

* 
context of this advice was a year old at the time I was told

* 
the confidential nature of out of court settlements is normal

* 
the amount paid was justified (between £700,000 and £1m)

* 
the mosely case (£60,000) happened after [something]

* 
key evidence in this case was only uncovered at the end of 2010 and not in 2009

* 
James: management of the NotW believed it was time for mr Chrone to leave - I was not involved in these conversations

* 
James: I have no knowledge of Andy Coulsons wages being subsidised by NotW

* 
James: I am not aware of the term ""wilful blindness""  (a phrase used to convict people in the Enron case)

* 
Rupert: we were not ever guilty of Wilful Blindness

* 
james: we have been trained by legal teams on the context of this meeting on how to answer the questions we were asked

* 
main advice we were given about this meeting was to tell the truth

* 
Rupert: I seldomly talk to the editors of my newspapers, I would ring the editor of the NotW on saturdays, and would ring the editor of the Sunday Times **every** saturday

* 
not to influence what they say

* 
I am most involved with the editor of the WSJ

* 
rupert: perhaps I lost sight of the NotW.

* 
I was never told about the payements during my talks with the editors.

* 
normally talked about the expose reports that they did

* 
wouldn't be told about large payoffs

* 
James: given the advice of counsel I made appropriate compensation payements.

* 
rupert:  Mr Coulson cancelled contracts to Mr Clifford

* 
rupert: I don't know what was in the contracts

* 
James is being asked why payements were made much larger when no one knew about the phone hacking

* 
James: my understanding is that the £60k settlement in the mosely case was after the advice about the taylor settlement.  What we knew at the time was the senior independent counsel, the damages we expect to pay was very high.  

* 
the £600k included damages, legal fees and costs to the company.

* 
james: I did not have 1st hand knowledge of Clive Goodmans case. I was not working in the correct part of NI to have knowledge of this.

**note by me: where's Rebecca Brooke at?**

* 
James is being asked about Clive Goodmans lawyer - the most expensive lawyer in the country, ""did NI pay for the lawyer?"" - ""why would NI pay the legal fees for someone involved in criminal activity""

* 
james: I have no specific knowledge of this case

* 
I have raised the same questions in the company, and have been surprised.

* 
it is customary for NI to pay the legal costs of staff

* 
I ma happy to do follow-up payements later, but I have no knowledge of this specific case

it is, from time to time, customary. I am unsure if NI is still paying his legal fees, but I have asked that the company ceases paying these legal fees.

** I'm going to smoke, this is taking a long time **

* 
james is being asked about the documents handed to the police, but is reluctant to talk about them due to the ongoing investigation. 

* 
the committee think that is not an excuse to avoid the question

* 
James has seen the documents and tried not to use explitatives when he first saw them. 

* 
james: I want the police to undergo their investigation and the company is cooperating fully

* 
james: we want the correct people to be brought to justice

* 
rupert: I concur

* 
the letter provided to the enquiry by Lawrence Abraham (lawyer) implied that there was nothing that had come to light contradicting the lone-reporter working with g Moulcur. 

* 
james: all I can say is having directed and looked at the advice of the company that has looked more recently that it was right to bring the information to the police. The police also said that there was no reason to open a new investigation, as did the PCC.

* 
it was only when *new* evidence emerged that the original investigation was undermined.

* 
if there is additional information, then we will comply with the investigation completely.

* 
james: I do not know why the investigation was limited to the 6 people it originally was. 

* 
we had been told it was a thorough investigation.

* 
in hindsight we can all say ""if only we had known"" but cannot comment on the previous investigation

* 
James: some of the people we are talking about are either currently on bail or are arrested, it is not possibe for me to comment on ongoing investigations.

* 
I am not aware of allegations in 2007, I did not work in my position at that time. The outside counsel advised us that we should be satisfied.

* 
our outside counsel is to blame for the company taking a long amount of time to reopen an internal investigation &lt;-- not ver-batim

* 
james: I am not willing to remove the letter from the outside counsel as evidence, as it proves that the company had sought outside counsel.

* 
James: John Chapman and the organisation decided that it was in mutual interest to part ways.  There is no evidence of wrongdoing, I have no evidence of him attempting to hide evidence

* 
the director of HR left NI over a year ago, and I am unaware of his current employment status.

* 
I can't speak to issues within NI in 2007, specifically Mr Hinton (HR director)

* 
rupert: it is not my role as CEO to know about specific directors at specific sections of my organisation

* 
James: I cannot speak for my director. I know that Ms Brookes was one of the people who brought phone hacking to my attention.

* 
being asked about who kept the Murdoch's in the dark about the ongoings in their company?

* 
James: the company at the time hired a lawfirm to go over the files and NI made the decision based on the counsel sought, the Police and the PCC agreeing that there was no need for further investigation

* 
the company has done the right thing by reopening the investigation when it did.

* 
James: the company takes it very seriously. We brought in additional counsel to advise the company on full transparency.

* 
being asked again: who at the news of the world was keeping that file from the police, legal counsel? Do you find that a decent state of affairs?

* 
Rupert: No I do not

* 
as soon as we found out about these files we took them straight to the police

* 
james: as soon as the files were in a new criminal investigation they were handed to the police after our legal counsel read through them

* 
Rupert: I cannot say if my editors will have known about phone hacking due to the legal investigations that are ongoing. I can say that Mr Hinton was told to find out ""what the hell was going on"". That is my understanding of it, but I cannot swear (raises hand) that this is accurate.

* 
new questioner. Asks about a week in the life of NotW.

* 
James: I was never intimately involved wiht the workings of the NotW. 

* 
Rupert: I understand the ongoings as far as personelle, advertising and simmilar figures.

* 
Q: how come you don't know about the legal fees then?

* 
james: the papers each have their own legal resources.

* 
rupert: My son's typical week could have been a day in Milan, followed by a day in London etc.

* 
q: ""Rupert, you have been kept in the dark quite a bit recently""

* 
rupert: I have not been kept in the dark

* 
q: ""are there no rules about people telling you""

* 
rupert: when it's a crisis, it's brought to me

* 
james: it is different from us being kept in the dark, and our editors doing the decision making, we cannot make all of the decisions of our entire company.

* 
there is a system in place that the CEO only becomes aware of problems when they are worthy.

* 
James: we were made aware of the criminal activities in 2007

* 
q: ""who do you hold responsible for the failures of NotW?""

* 
James: to my knowledge certain things were not known, the company acted when it had become apparent that things had gone wrong.

* 
you can immagine my own frustration when in 2010 these things came out. NI's denial of the litigation in 2009 is a matter of deep regret, and is why we're here today, and we look for complete transparency.

* 
q: ""are you guilty of nepotism, do you regret that NI has become a family organisation?""

* 
rupert: when we became the head of BskyB several people were hired, including my son. When he left to go to NI Europe/Asia we had calls from all the big shareholders, saying that it was a terrible idea to take him away from BskyB, he was a great CEO

* 
Rupert: I do not think that my organisation has suffered as a result of NI being run as a family business.

* 
**new questioner**

* 
Rupert: people cannot expect a right to privacy.

* 
phone hacking is not included in this, that was wrong

* 
investigative journalism makes us a better society, so long as it's done transparently.

* 
the line is to be drawn at criminal activities.

*
rupert: talking about the telegraph buying illegal documents about the PM expenses.

*
hopes for a world where ministers already earn millions, and don't have to think about taking money from the people.

* 
james: lawbreakers have no place in NI

* 
rupert: I do not think that there is a cultural problem within my company. People working for me are not scared of me.

** I need to go to work now, this is taking MUCH longer than it should have =( **

true,employeeno5,dalek,Dalek,"You're a bit mixed-up here. The 2005 film is **not** in fact a remake of the 1968 film, but a further adaptation of the 2001 stage-play which John Barrowman did indeed perform in on stage as well as in the later film. 

In 2001 Mel Brooks took his 1968 film classic, which was a film *about* a musical, and turned the whole thing into an *actual musical* (not a full production of ""Spring Time For Hitler"", but turning the full film of the ""The Producers"" into a musical act). So it then became an entire musical about a musical, not just a ""straight"" play or a film about a musical. The musical of ""The Producers"" was so popular that they made a film of the musical in 2005. So it's not a redo of the 1968 film which was not a musical (simply about a musical), it's a filming of the actual musical based upon that original film. 

So the 1968 film stands as it is. It had a full stage-musical made out of it in 2001. In 2005 a film-musical was made of that stage-musical, not a remake of the original non-musical-film. All three projects were written and directed by the same man, Mel Brooks.

And as far this stuff goes, yes John Barrowman was part of the live Broadway musical cast. Almost all of the original members of the opening Broadway cast were used for the cast of 2005 film adaptation of that musical.

Sorry if that was tedious but you seemed confused about the timelines and nature of these productions (understandable, what with there being musicals inside musicals and multiple films and whatnot.) 

Ironically, given all the effort I just put in, I don't think John Barrowman is a very talented actor, and would agree that he's just been involved in projects that tend to get extreme fandom and cult-followings. Which is ok and awesome, but I wouldn't mistake him for a great actor. He definitely belongs in musicals or kitchy stuff, as a complex or subtle performance are not coming out of him.

The Doctor concludes that the cold star is in fact a dream and therefore blows up the TARDIS to escape, dying in the dream and returning to reality. If, though, the TARDIS was blown up in reality, that means that the ""reality"" from *Amy's Choice* is, in fact, another dream.

Unfortunately, everything after that gets rather confusingly paradoxical and forces you to accept that dreams can be used to manipulate reality, which in turn leaks into dreams.

true,JimmySinner,null,null,"Ester Drummond becomes immortal but is somehow transported back in time and turned to stone, possibly in Pompeii. She continues to grow even though she's now made of stone. One day, after she'd been all over the world to try to find a cure to her condition she feels very tired so she just sits down somewhere in London. When she sits down and falls asleep, her form begins to change and eventually she becomes a building.

She wakes up for a short while and realises what has happened to her and as a cry for help, she tries to make her name appear on her new facade. Because it's been so very long since she's even said her name out loud she gets it slightly wrong and it comes out as 'Wester Drumlins'. It took so much energy for her to do that that she has no other choice but to sleep for hundreds of years, during which time she misses the visit of other stone creatures who had actually come to help her but couldn't find a way to wake her up.

When she does wake up at some point in the future she has now completely forgotten her name but she vaguely remembers that in the early part of her sleep there were families who would come and go, and those families would call her 'House'.

Now that she was well rested and had all the energy she needed to move on, she broke away from the earth to find new worlds that might have a cure for her condition. She keeps growing larger and larger but needs more and more energy to keep her alive. Somehow she falls out of the universe and worries about how she will live and feed. Then something falls through into her little bubble on the edge of the universe. She doesn't know what it is but she knows that it has all the energy that she could need for quite a while. She eats it up but finds that she's left with the things that were inside it. Those two little creatures talk on her back, and remind her about words. She's so strong after eating the tasty thing with all the energy that she can learn to talk back to them, and even through them. She learns what the tasty thing was called, a TARDIS, and she learns that there are more little creatures with TARDISes who might come if she tricks them. Other things come through sometimes as well, and Ester thinks they're okay to eat but there aren't enough and they aren't tasty like a TARDIS is.

Observational humour is a type of comedy that is easily criticised because it's perceivably easy and for some, just not funny. What makes Michael McIntyre great for the vast majority of people, however, is his performance, charisma and style of delivery.

Being metrosexual is in. Being camp is in. Approaching previously taboo-like subjects casually is in. He appeals to the general public quite widely.

That being said, I can't see his career lasting much longer than a few more years, perhaps less. But that's not to say that he's not a good comedian, but much like fashion, the popularity of comedy styles fluxes just as frequently.

Before today I actually hadn't heard of Stewart Lee and whilst he may be funny (I have yet to find out), the fact he can get so apparently worked up over something like this to the point of writing an article largely surrounding it is pretty much the direct inverse of funny.

Here are the must-watches from the black &amp; white era (first two Doctors):

**First Doctor (Hartnell)**

- An Unearthly Child
- The Daleks
- The Aztecs
- The Dalek Invasion of Earth
- The Time Meddler
- The War Machines
- The Tenth Planet

**Second Doctor (Troughton)** (tougher cos most of his episodes are missing)

- The Tomb of the Cybermen
- The Mind Robber
- The Invasion
- The War Games

Obviously, you don't *have* to watch all of those, but they're all good.  What really sucks is that some of the best stories only exist now in audio form (the tapes having been wiped by the BBC in the seventies), which can be a chore to deal with if you're trying to watch EVERYTHING.

Also, there's very little overall story arcs in the classic series.  The arcs of the 2005+ series (requiring you to pretty much watch every episode in order) were heavily inspired by shows like *Buffy the Vampire Slayer* and not so much classic *Who*.

The upshot of which is, you can watch any random story of the classic series and not be lost, unlike modern DW (at least, the past couple seasons - I challenge anyone to watch a random Series 6 episode without seeing them in order and *not* be confused).",0,1311102653,null,0,false,0,c26mu5q,t3_it5m8,t1_c26mu5q,t1_c26fm94,1427366784,2,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,2

McIntyre isn't in the daily mail crowd; he doesn't attack political correctness because to most people there is nothing funny about it. He doesn't stand up for the little man, he doesn't really represent anyone but himself (there's no fault you can find in that). 

This is why he's popular; because the vast majority of Britains relate to this: people don't want to think about the social implications that top gear has, the hypocrisy of most modern media outlets, how the extreme right show their constant ignorance. Its brain dead entertainment, its nothing entertainment, no-one will care in a few years and that's fine. He's a target for other comics because of this; its like Ned Flanders minus the Christianity, all you have is a nice guy that doesn't really do a lot outside of work with some quirky catch phrases and odd ball behaviour.

Stuart Lee, who I is a much smarter comedian, makes his comedy about taking a stand for something and works his acts and performances around this. He might not be a great political mover of the 21st Century but his comedy expresses something, says something and that scares papers like the mail. Its not offensive and dismiss-able as such, like Franky Boyle, but, rather, takes an intelligent, thought provoking, liberal view of the world.

I've had conversations with friends about comedians and found we had very similar tastes, then we'd come to someone like Russell Howard and found our opinions differed wildly. As comedy is so subjective it can often be hard to see the appeal comedians have to others when you don't find them funny at all.

In light of that, I honestly find Stewart Lee funny. I don't like him because I'm meant to; in fact, as hipster as this may sound, I stumbled upon him when he was relatively unknown, and it was one of the best comedic discoveries I made. I'm not going to deny that the fact he is 'different' is part of the reason I like him- but it wouldn't mean anything if he wasn't funny in the first place. I also find him not just funny, but thought-provoking and intelligent.

I sympathise with you for not liking him- god knows there are plenty of comedians I cannot stand and I get so much shit for not liking them. Its fine to have different tastes. But I also think its important to understand that if other people like them, that doesn't mean that their taste is automatically bad or that there is some other sinister reason behind their admiration- they simply have a different opinion.

Also, I feel obliged to point out that Lee (probably) doesn't think he is above most other comedians.

true,hennell,cnty-uk,Bristol,"I think MM is funny and certainly isn't doing what anyone could do, but he is doing what a lot of comics could do (or think they could), and rarely has a real message, point or completely original topic which many comics strive for. MM often covers topics that other comedians might have rejected as 'hack-ish' or covers new-topics with more jokes other comedians might consider too obvious for them to have performed.  

There was similar fuss in the magic community back when David Blaine appeared/became big (back when he still did actual magic tricks). His tricks were often old things others had been performing for years, his patter and presentation was uninspiring or basic and his slights were nothing magicians hadn't seen better elsewhere. But he became a household name, because his tricks and street-style presentation was new to the audience and they seemed to like the no-nonsense, no stupid glam and girls presentation style.

As a magic enthusiast (at the time of DB) and a comedy writer now I'd personally say the hatred you see for both people comes from a combination of the same three things:

Jealously - because the other professionals see it as easy and thus are annoyed they didn't think of it/the fact they have to work 'harder' and are less successful.

Not being intrested by the work - because it's considered 'obvious' or 'old' or 'not inventive' the act doesn't intrest the profesionals who've seen it all before, and don't understand why the audiences are so enthralled. There are loads of big name comics and magicans who are well respected because they can entertain the pros with their new and exciting acts. (The 'boring act' might also causes pros to underestimate how hard said act is, which could cause a vicious circle with the jelousy over how easy it is.).

Mis-representing the 'scene' - because it's not seen as new or original, this populist stuff isn't considered a true reflection of the 'scene', which gives the impression that the 'new guy' is disrespecting the craft/art; and means audiences might not realise how much better -you are. (Feeding into jelousy again).

(I think this can also be seen in other scenes like iPhone apps etc. The simple games like angry birds which are new and impressive to the adverage player, but programmers feel the code is 'easy' and 'boring' because it's been done before.)

You have one quite major thing against you, if you have ""agreed"" (which means either explicitly signing the checkin/inventory or not disputing it within the time frame specified in your AST) that the property was professionally cleaned (which, by the way, is not an agreed standard) then the adjudicator would be expected to award to the landlord the cost of cleaning the property.  £200 is steep but not for London, and I can see that going through.

However, as Xennith mentions, if the deposit was not lodged correctly you can take the landlord or acting agent to court for 3* the deposit amount. Which is cool. However, there are also other factors, for example you have a certain timespan to see the checkout report and dispute it.

I wouldn't start with a multi-doctor episode like any episode entitled The ___ Doctors.  Those rely on fanservice and nostalgia.  They're awesome, but not to start.  There are plenty of classic eps that are good in context but won't hook you.

Option 1:  Sylvester's 3 series start out very silly, but end up with a really modern sensibility and I think Matt is taking some real cues from him.  You could start there because while they had some of the lowest relative budgets there's a lot of stuff that informed the new series.

Option 2:  Maybe watch a later 3rd Doctor episode such as The Time Warrior (if you like historical comedy this one is great) and segue through that last series into Tom's Doctor.  That way you get a nice start with Action Doctor and you get to see the genesis of the 4th Doctor.  Tom really started brilliantly and it'd give you a good feel for the classic show in a couple seasons...

Option 3: As referenced above, Last/first seasons of different doctor's often work well and create a real connection.  Another reason I think Davies was okay with the 9th regenerating so quickly.

Option 4:  Robert Holmes.  There are plenty of fantastic classic writers certainly, but he had very consistent quality.  The Auntie/Uncle double-act from the Doctor's Wife was so Holmesian it made me smile.

tl;dr:  Start anywhere, but do try more than one story if the first doesn't hook you.  It might be the 3rd or 10th you watch that's the one.  The show is worth it.",0,1311134540,null,0,false,0,c26q9hs,t3_iueei,t1_c26q9hs,t3_iueei,1427368398,2,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,2

Perhaps it is a danger to go the European road whilst not boosting spending, which could *arguably* make the NHS less efficient by this measure.

Interestingly, the Scottish NHS is going the opposite road. The Scottish government has a knee jerk opposition to private provision that this subreddit would be proud of.

Third guess: You have a son serving in Afghanistan and keep coming back to the question: who funds the Taliban? Illegal profits from Prohibition might buy the weapon that kills your son; ending prohibition would turn off one money-tap.

An old enemy had developed time travelling technology and was waging war against us. Can you imagine Jean Luc? A great war fought across all of time? No of course you can't, your primitive monkey brain can't even grasp the concept. We were losing. The enemy would have erased our species from history and gone on to destroy every other form of life.

That's not how the law,  or evidence-based investigation works.  You can't just declare something suspicious without any solid evidence first.

Rather, you say it's not being treated as suspicious but you continue to investigate it, and then if you find *any solid evidence at all* that it could be suspicious, you begin treating it as suspicious *then*.

Police work and judicial enquiry are evidence-based.  The reddit community's knee-jerk reaction are emotion and assumption-based, but you *really* don't want judicial enquiries being conducted that way.

""Not treating a death as suspicious"" does not mean they've rendered a verdict and stopped investigating it.  It means they're keeping an open mind and continuing to investigate but can't justify the additional expense and manpower that suspicious-death investigations based on the knee-jerk assumptions and suggestive eyebrow-waggling of a bunch of amateur commenters on the internet.

Refusing to jump to conclusions is not indicative of a cover-up.  If anything it's *more* indicative of a professional, detached and evidence-based investigation, which is *exactly what people should want*.

If it turns out the guy ""committed suicide"" by shooting himself twice in the back of the head from ten feet away (or similar) and they still refuse to  treat it as suspicious then great - I'll be handing out the pitchforks and flaming torches with the best of them; however, at the moment they're merely sensibly and professionally reserving judgement pending *any evidence whatsoever*.",0,1311172151,null,0,true,0,c26ss19,t3_iumjy,t1_c26ss19,t1_c26sg60,1427369584,6,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,6

Not sure if there's a reason not to do this, but I considered a system where whatever benefits you would be allowed without a job would simply be reduced by 75% (or some other arbitrary - or maybe thought out number) of what you earn.

Eg. if you get £100 in benefits, but then work to earn £50, you still get £62.50 in benefits on top totalling £112.50 --- If you work to earn £100 then you still get £25 on top totalling £125 --- if you work for £125 then you still get an extra £6.25 --- so somewhere around earning £135 you'd no longer ge benefit money on top, in a case where benefits were £100.

It does seem silly (and even arbitrary or nonsensical) and you might ask why someone should be getting benefits when they're making more than the benefits would be, but the answer is simply because the current system doesn't work in a lot of these cases, and an incentive would do a damned lot of good to solve the problem.",0,1311180206,null,0,false,0,c26tr0v,t3_iuwj4,t1_c26tr0v,t3_iuwj4,1427370120,8,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,8

The guy used to drive a bus some 10 years ago, then quit because he had some heart problems, which probably had a lot to do with him spending every single day in the pub and smoking like a chimney.  He hasn't worked since.

The woman had a job for 1 month almost... 10 years ago, I think, before getting busted for benefit fraud.  Now she gets an allowance to care for him because apparantley he's not able to do anything.  A few years ago the kid got hit by a car and they got given a brand new Focus Sport for 2 years, tax free, insurance free, to take him to about 2 hospital appointments, and to take him to college (he's a bit slow or something and has a tutor) - despite the council sending a taxi around for him every single day and returning him in a taxi later that day...

The daughter got knocked up and got housed in some flat free of charge, and basically smokes all day.  Oh, she also gets some benefit to come around every few days to see her slow brother.  What the fuck is that about?
When it's sunny outside, literally all they do is sit in the garden on shitty white plastic furniture, open the windows and play a CD of The Worlds' Best Number 2 Singles loud enough to annoy everyone else, while they drink and smoke from about 9am until the early evening.  The fat tramp across the road sometimes takes time out of her busy schedule of doing nothing to join them.  Last year, on the Monday, the had 5 green bags out full of nothing more than bottles and cans.  On the Thursday (bag day), they had 9 bags of bottles and cans.  They smoke like chimneys all day and do most of their shopping from the fucking ice cream van[1].  The guy regularly (several times a week) returns from the pub by taxi at around 1am.

How the fuck can they afford this?  We couldn't afford to drink all day long and we all work!  It's great going out in the morning to work, seeing them all there drinking, then coming home from work and they're still there, and wondering how they're paying for it - oh yeah, *I'm* paying for it!

true,friendlyhumanist,k9,K-9,"The Silence told Amy in the bathroom to tell the Doctor ""what he should not know"" or something to that effect. Later we learn the Silence use subliminal messages to get people to do things. Amy thinks the Silence wants her to tell the Doctor about his death, but she doesn't tell him about his death until much later, and then she doesn't seem compelled to do it.

Later in that episode where the Silence tell Amy she must tell the Doctor, Amy blurts *out of nowhere* that she's pregnant. They're doing something completely different, and it's noticeably odd that Amy blurts that out at that time. I think the Silence subliminally encouraged Amy to tell the Doctor she was pregnant.

Why? Only when the Doctor begins investigating Amy's pregnancy does he realize she is Flesh and only then does he set out to stop Kovarian and the Headless Monks. I think the Silence wanted him to do that. I don't know why.

Further evidence for the idea that the Silence and the Kovarians are opposed: Kovarian and Co. had a whole army at their disposal to raise and take care of their most important possession, a part Time Lady. Instead, they just hand her over to the Silence? And the Silence can't take care of her with the materials they were given, so they have to *start the space program* to make a suit to feed her? Nothing about that makes sense to me.

Of course, this doesn't necessarily mean that the Silence are good, only that they're not working with Kovarian.

TL;DR: Silence wanted the Doctor to find out about Kovarian's plans. It's unlikely (to me) that they're working together.",0,1311205595,null,0,false,0,c26wvvu,t3_iuzi4,t1_c26wvvu,t3_iuzi4,1428198297,7,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,7

Stranger: Cool. I'm not a time traveler

You: Martha!

You: Quite possibly.

Stranger: Martha...who is this?

You: Fraid so.

You: 38.

You: People don't understand time... It's not what you think it is.

Stranger: What do you mean?

You: Complicated.

Stranger: Understood.

You: Very complicated.

You: People assume that time a strict progression of cause to effect,

You: but ACTUALLY from a non-linear, non-subjective view it's more like a big ball...

You: of wibbly wobbly... timey wimey... stuff.

Stranger: So if you're in 1969, how are you accessing the internet?

You: It got away from me, yeah...

You: Well, I can hear you.

Stranger: You can hear me/

Stranger: ?

You: Well, not HEAR you exactly, but I know everything you're going to say.

Stranger: Well, what is the next thing I am going to type?

You: Look to your left.

You: I've got a copy of the finished transcript. It's on my AutoCue.

You: I got it in the future.

You: We have got big problems now.

Stranger: like what?

You: They've taken the blue box, haven't they?

You: The angels have the phone box.

Stranger: Help me out, what blue box? This is remimding me of a book that I've read

You: Creatures from another world.

You: Only when you see them.

You: Lonely assassins, they were called...

Stranger: And how do you see them?

You: No one knows where they came from. They're as old as the universe, or very nearly.

You: They've survived this long, because they have the most perfect defense mechanism ever evolved.

You: They are quantum-locked. They don't exist when being observed.

You: The moment they are seen by any other living creature they freeze into rock.

Stranger: Interesting...

You: No choice, it's a fact of their biology.

You: In the sight of any living thing, they turn into stone.

You: And you can't kill a stone.

You: Course, a stone can't kill you either.

You: But then you turn your head away

You: Then you blink

You: And oh yes it can.

Stranger: Unless someones throwing it

You: And I'm very very sorry.

You: It's up to you now.

Stranger: What am I suppose to do :/

Stranger: And how am i suppose to beleive this?

You: The blue box, it's my time machine.

You: There's a world of time energy in there, enough to switch off the sun. We need to get it back.

Stranger: I don't really believe you...

You: And... that's it. There's no more from you on the transcript. I don't know what's stopped you talking but I can guess.

You: They're coming. The angels are coming.

You: But listen carefully because your life may depend on it.

You: Don't blink.

You: Don't even blink.

You: Blink and you're dead.

You: They are fast.

You: Faster than you can believe.

You: Don't turn your back.

You: Don't look away.

You: And don't - blink.

You: Good luck.

true,chochazel,null,null,"&gt;A lot of his act is, for want of a better term, meta-comedy, and only really works if you're a bit of a comedy geek.

- A lot of the most fantastic comedy produced includes some kind of awareness of the medium which they're using.  Monty Python had loads of ""TV"" jokes, playing with the credits, announcements, costumes, punchlines, and every other convention that they're a part of.  That's the joy of it.  

- I think people sometimes forget that it's no bad thing to have comedy that's enjoyed by people who have some kind of appreciation, awareness and knowledge of comedy, any more than it would be a bad thing to have music that can be appreciated by people who have some kind of knowledge and love of music.

&gt;Jokes about the nature of jokes aren't necessarily for everyone, and whole routines based around the topic, may alienate the more casual viewer who rather enjoys the expectant tension of a good knock knock joke.

- Yes, and wouldn't it be awful if every comedian eschewed material that they genuinely found funny because they didn't want to alienate the casual viewer, and instead just trotted out the same fomulae?  There is enough room in British TV so that BBC 2 at 11:20 at night they can show comedy for people who don't want the same old routines just in case someone happens to be watching who has no knowledge or interest in comedy!

Given the global recognition of the BBC brand, if Cameron bows to Murdoch's supposed pressure and tries to cut the BBC down, what damage is he doing to both the global brand of the BBC and the revenues it brings in? What happens if Murdoch loses interest in the UK? Does that mean we've messed up the BBC to suit the whims of one corporation? Something we should already be outright rejecting.

I suppose I just can't understand the notion that the BBC can be 'powerful'. The BBC to me is more of a platform for various producers work that otherwise would be rejected for not being a guaranteed cash cow. That itself is a massively valuable asset - the BBC can take risks with its programming - it might not be to everyone's taste, but that's the thing - it can cater for various people. If it is specifically required to take a neutral stance on everything and offer impartial reporting as a news outlet and is a platform for producers to broadcast material which otherwise may be rejected, I do not see the issue.

It looks a lot more to me like it's a case of 'tear down the opposition' rather than attempt to build themselves up to the equivalent.

The BBC is more complicated because it is funded through a license fee, which itself is more or less a legal requirement for owning a TV, making it sort of an alternative to taxation.

true,Brian,null,null,"&gt;I have honestly never heard anyone say that before, it's a stupid argument.

To interject, I very much disagree - I'd support that claim, and think it's rather obviously true.  Drugs are obscenely profitable **because** they're illegal.  There's a high barrier to entry, which means the government is essentially enforcing the monopoly ofthose risk-tolerant enough to deal in it.

Take that away, and drugs become the same as other legal goods - you lose the high risks, but also the high profit margins.  A market where you can make a hundredfold return is a very different one from one where you can make a 50% profit.  The same kind of people simply aren't going to decide to take that option, especially since the vast majority of their expertise specifically relates to dealing in the conditions of an illegal environment.  A legal one completely does away with the illegal transport, distribution and enforcement, which are the very areas where violence is used.  Those people will then need something to do.  Manufacture is less affected (though moreso with outright legalisation rather than decriminalisation), but those aren't the issue - they're generally not the ones causing the violence ATM either.

Where I disagree with Xennith is in seeing this as zero-sum.  There is a reason those people *already* aren't in robbery and assault - it's less profitable and more dangerous.  Without that profitability, there's less incentive to take those risk, so any bump in those rates are going to be temporary until the glut of displaced dealers created by the drug trade plays out.

It would create an unforseen amount of jobs. It would be another ""death"" industry, similar to smoking, but if we, the UK, regulate it the same we have smoking, AND tax it pretty heavily, we will be the winners.

Those other countries you list are doing well , but times are good in the developed world what happens when things take a turn for the worse. The nature of humanity hasn't changed so much in the past 70 years that it would make another great war impossible. 

In a hypothetical situation how well would Spain, Italy Sweden, Norway, Netherlands and Austria do if they found themselves under attack ? At the moment they find themselves with strong allies who are willing to look out for them but that might not be the situation in the future. Some of those nations would find it almost impossible to defend themselves alone against a more powerful militaristic nation. 

Some might say that if we feel the need for them, if a true threat arrises we could construct new ones. But knowledge can be lost, after 20 years without any we would have to spend more to research and develop anew. 

We don't know what might happen in the future, things might be fine. We could see the creation of a European state this century a continuation of the peace we have enjoyed at home. Or we could spend years worrying about the threat of invasion across the channel. 

Regarding it making the UK a target for a potential first strike target is a little short sighted. If anyone were to attack the UK with nuclear weapons of the scale the USSR had we would cease to exist as a nation that much isn't contested. But they would have to pay the price. We keep our weapons on submarines because this country is far too small and crowded to keep land launched missiles in they would be destroyed straight away, subs allow us to keep our nukes hidden so that if anyone should strike they can be damn sure they would pay the price. That's what the deterrent was about , it was never about defending ourselves against other nukes it was about making sure that if someone decided to nuke us, we'd make damn sure they paid a terrible price for it. We can look at nukes as a viable method for keeping the UK secure from a naval born invasion and that's where their value would lie if there were ever a scenario that such an event was likely.

The risk/reward ratio remains nearly constant until drugs start getting too high for people to afford (which for addicts, creates social problems of its own).

One of my best friends is a police officer and agrees with me (and actually persuaded me)- honest to god he thinks there are far far too many and most of them sit around looking for work to do. 

Walking the beat is the biggest waste of time ever, they never *do* anything except get paid to go on strolls and reassure old people. When they're called out to something, sure they're busy, but depending on where you're working and on what shift this might happen once a week. If they get *really* bored they might go driving around with no particular aim.

On Friday and Saturday nights the ones who are deployed are busy, sure, but ask a Police Officer how often he has to do Friday or Saturday nights. Hint: its a lot less often than once a week.

I've been pretty much guaranteed by my friend (who's worked for two different forces btw) that if police officer numbers were cut by a third there'd be absolutely no effect on the standard of policing. This is assuming of course that the Commissioners don't intentionally cut police numbers in the really important areas to make a political point, which I actually wouldn't put past them.

If you think I'm exaggerating I chatted to this friend a few weeks ago and asked him when the last time he arrested anyone was- it'd been about a month. In the *entire* week of full time work he'd done the only thing he'd done was give a verbal warning to a drunk 15 year old who'd managed to trophy a traffic cone. Its an absolute joke.

So, sure, cut a good chunk of them and tell the Commissioners to move the ones who don't actually do anything to somewhere more busy- they'd probably thank you for it.

Incidentally they don't actually sack incompetent officers- its pretty impossible to do- they just keep paying them and move them to stupid villagers where they have *even* less work to do.

true,[deleted],null,null,"I'm quite the socialist too, on the quiet, but I tend to try and avoid actually identifying myself as such.  I'm not ashamed about it, I believe in it for purely altruistic and practical reasons of which I'm proud.  

I just don't like calling myself a socialist because bugger me sideways if every self-described socialist doesn't come across like they're auditioning to be in Chumbawamba's Tubthumping, and a bit of a knob.  

Every thing's so black and white, binary right or left; I'm socialist-he's capitalist, it's all about the struggle, struggle, struggle.  In fact, I swear, they'd struggle to find struggle even if struggle wasn't there.  It's like an angry 'Where's Wally'.

The other problem is socialists tend to malign themselves.  I feel like a lioness stalking antelope and just when I'm about to lunge the other socialist lionesses blow my cover by talking about economics.  The problem being anybody to the right of a socialist is invariably called a capitalist and chances are anybody anywhere to the right of them  probably haven't given it much thought, but whilst the 'socialists' have been discussing ideology and generally calling for more struggle over pints of bitter and salt and vinegar crisps, the every day bloke is thinking in more practical terms; what's the price, can I afford it, do I need it?  And herein lies the problem, whilst socialists have the ideological argument sewn up (and they largely have and I agree with it) everybody else has been honing their practicalities and economics to a level just good enough to see that the more vocal 'socialists', which is an economic term after all, aren't actually that good when it comes to economics.

I'll give you an example.  You propose raising income tax and stimulating the economy by investing in infrastructure.  I don't agree with raising income tax but it has merits and certainly investing in infrastructure is a good thing to do, but then the practical socialist in me asks, *'How much are we going to have to spend to stimulate a £1.4 trillion economy?'*, and I come over Funny.  Lucky Funny.  You'd think my next question would be *'And how are we going to pay for it?* but it was actually *'And who is going to build it?'*  They've already spent billions renovating East London and they're already spending billions bolstering the M6 spine, so any stimulation is in addition to this - there's only so many major construction companies in the UK, and NO, you can't just look at the unemployment figures and say 'use them'.  If the taxpayer is covering this and a company is hiring them they have a right to demand a qualified and suitable person does the job and not any Yosser Hughes.  They're going to have to put it to tender and contract it out, and we know exactly what that means; Spanish construction companies desperate for work will underbid and get it.  

*So now they have to spend even more money on even more infrastructure to compensate for money flowing into Spain, the deficit's growing not shrinking, city companies are finding harder to hire the best candidates because of the higher income taxes and because of all the money you've been spending the Pound is buckling...it's like cutting a hole in a boat to let the water out.*

Socialist is a broad term, and largely I agree with you that ""socialists"" have a bit of an image problem. 

Anyway, the argument over exactly how to ""stimulate an economy"" isn't necessarily one in which socialists and capitalists, left and right wing, will fall into their neat little pigeonholes, there are disagreements on both sides about this particular issue.

&gt;You'd think my next question would be 'And how are we going to pay for it? but it was actually 'And who is going to build it?'

Actually, your question is much better than ""who is going to pay for it?"", because paying for it isn't the problem - if you get the right people to build it. We already have a highways department, and county councils who are responsible for building and maintaining roads. In recent years they have had all new projects stopped and their budgets cut by a third (this is my particular council here, but I imagine the picture is largely the same across the country..).

Investment in the public services, public sector, not private sector is what I'm talking about. That should practically eliminate the chance of the work being outsourced to anyone, let alone anyone abroad. Certainly if you're talking about trying to stimulate the economy you could make it a condition of the budget that the money doesn't go abroad - if that's what you're into. These qualified people we need for these projects exist - there'd be more of them if we'd keep paying for the education - but there's enough of them anyway. A lot of them have already been made redundant in the past 12 months, and a lot more of them will be made redundant in the next. These people don't command huge wages, but they do do a valuable job. I'd argue that it's better to pay them to do that job and invest their time in our public services and infrastructure than it is to pay them to sit on the dole (and give them massive redundancy payments - as is happening.)

If someone keeps their job, they also keep spending, which is great for business. It's hard to make a business work when all your potential customers are unemployed - unless you're someone like cash4gold or wonga.com..

I watched a good amount of season 1 for the 1st doctor, but some of my episodes are just audio and still photos, painful to sit through.

I'm guessing the earlier doctor episodes are a bit incomplete in format. 

There's just soooo many, I wanted to watch the important episodes while skipping over the silly unimportant ones.

It's just that I hate this ""fuck the rich"" attitude people seem to have. High earners have 50% of their income taxed, and those agree to this shouldn't be punished simply because it's easy for certain individuals to exploit the loopholes allowing them to avoid paying tax. Close the loopholes and if people want to leave, let them leave. At least by doing that, the worst that could theoretically happen is that income tax revenue neither increases or decreases.

However, whether or not raising taxes would raise more money for the government is besides the point for me; I could never justify, in my mind, raising income tax above 50% (which I already believe is too high) because I believe it to be profoundly wrong.

true,sync0pate,uk,West Mids,"&gt;It's not for the government to decide how rich people's money should be spent by taxing them at ridiculous high rates.

This all comes down to whether you think ""rich"" people have a right to that money or not.

I think there is a certain income level, above which you cannot go and remain ethical. At a certain point, whether you are a manager, or a banker, or a CEO, you are making profit from *other people's work*. A lot of the time this is, directly or indirectly, because you had more money to start with.

The only reason it's even *possible* for someone to become and stay rich, is if other people are exploited. In this country, that's not always so visible, because we outsource a lot of our exploitation to India and China, but it's true nonetheless. The rich in this country enjoy taking value out of society that they could never possibly hope to contribute in return.

I know chances are by now you've switched off, because we have this deeply-instilled notion that people have the right to the rewards of their own work; however what I'm suggesting is that some people's ""work"" consists of nothing more than skimming a little off the top of other people's labour - and I don't consider that they have a right to that.

Even if none of that washes with you whatsoever, there's the question of need. I can't conscionably say that a wealthy man earning £100,000 a year should be entitled to keep all of it to buy a new car, if the upshot of that is that someone else becomes homeless, or ill, or starves.

Yes, it should, but I think what the OP is getting at is that the system punishes him for doing exactly that.

Just consider the figures. If he was unemployed, the state subsidy would of him would be £114 a week (using his figures). If we allowed him to claim £50 pound of this even though he was working, we (the state) would be better off, and he would be better off. But because he loses all of his benefits, he's worse off working.

It's not that unusual either.  A full time minimum wage job will bring in about £195 a week after tax. The last time I was renting a place, my rent was £115 pounds a week, and that was six years ago.

Add on council tax and travel costs, and if I'd lost my job, I would have been far better off on benefits than I would have been taking a minimum wage job.

Firstly, really? Do you even realise how discriminatory that sounds? There was nothing about creationism or religion in that entire article, but you felt the need to bring it up. Hasn't Northern Ireland suffered enough with people using religion or religious beliefs to knock others down? If you had have left that first bit out, I might have been inclined to give you an upvote for submitting an interesting article, but instead I feel the need to let you know that I think you have to examine your language a bit more closely.

And secondly, sure, no-one likes to see A&amp;E departments closed down, or people's jobs being cut, but 3 A&amp;E departments so close together is over the top. Would it not be better to have them spread out amongst other hospitals? Also, the reason WHY Edwin Poots was proposing to shut down some A&amp;E departments was because there weren't enough consultants to staff them properly. Would you really like to turn up to A&amp;E one night, only to discover that there isn't anyone available who has the skills to treat you? You'd be sent away, told to go to your GP or in the worst case, treated by an unskilled doctor which could do you more damage in the long run...

I think it's very poor logic to argue that as long as there are poor people, there should be a limit to how rich a person can be. Where do you define the threshold? The fact that you have an internet connection right now means that you could be giving more of your money to the less fortunate. The redistribution of wealth is a horrendously complicated issue; it is not the definitive answer to social-economic problems.

As for whether or not rich people ""have a right"" to their money, I consider that irrelevant. Just as an example, an online affiliate marketer can become a self-made millionaire without hiring or exploiting anyone. However, in all cases where money is earned through legal and ethical — I understand that this is subjective — means, who's to say that that person ""doesn't have a right"" to that money? Is the government any more deserving of it?

In addition, I don't like the way you describe rich people as a social and economic deadweight in saying that ""the rich in this country enjoy taking value out of society that they could never possibly hope to contribute in return."" That is completely untrue. Wealthy people spend their money — generating tax through VAT — and invest in new businesses. Even if money is sitting in a bank, some of it will end up in the government's pocket. When a government taxes individuals too highly, they are potentially preventing the start up of a new company or the expansion of an existing one.

What I'm ultimately trying to argue is that it's just as important to ask whether anyone has the right to *take away* money from the rich as it is to ask whether the rich have a right to their money.",0,1311269342,null,0,false,0,c272e6m,t3_ivosi,t1_c272e6m,t1_c271js4,1427374259,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

&gt;**neat little pigeonholes**

There are no pigeonholes.  There never were.  Pigeonholes are like the proverbial cake.

&gt;**because paying for it isn't the problem** 

See?  You just did it again.  I start talking economics with a fellow socialist, they say something and a little bit inside me dies.

Paying for it is a problem: ask Jimmy Callaghan!

&gt;**We already have a highways department, and county councils who are responsible for building and maintaining roads. In recent years they have had all new projects stopped and their budgets cut by a third (this is my particular council here, but I imagine the picture is largely the same across the country..).**

True but there's a huge difference between maintenance and investing in infrastructure like motorways, bridges and railways like you originally said.  It's difficult to see how bolstering council and service funds will translate into stimulating the economy if you want to keep it to the public sector.  More trees will get pruned, the streets will be cleaner, potholes will get filled in - all good things and there'll be some workers hired but nothing significant to address a £27 billion deficit, £17.4 billion of which the public sector is responsible for, axed down from £18.5 billion in 12 months.

&gt;**That should practically eliminate the chance of the work being outsourced to anyone, let alone anyone abroad.** 

No outsourcing?  

Player A has killed the FTSE250 and Balfour Beatty is packing its bags! [Highway commissions and councils have to outsource big projects and construction, even small projects, jobs and operations.](http://www.publictenders.net/tenders/category/transport)  They might be able to arrange a bit of tarmac and maintenance on their own, to cut the grass in the park, but everyday work is already much bigger than that even with reduced budgets.  The FTSE250 is made up of businesses that win government and council contracts.  That's point one.

Point two is in guaranteeing no contracts would go overseas, and legislating on it, the UK would have to drop out of the EU.  Not an opinion; a fact.  If you happen to be for dropping out of the EU then that's fine, but understand that it is an unavoidable consequence of such legislation.

&gt;**These qualified people we need for these projects exist - there'd be more of them if we'd keep paying for the education - but there's enough of them anyway.** 

Yes and they're all leaving the country if you say councils can't put contracts up for public tender and you gut the private sector.  And if the state hires them it still has to pay them, so the public deficit has just gotten even bigger.

&gt;**These people don't command huge wages, but they do do a valuable job.** 

They command pretty significant wages and so do their projects if you're going to make any difference to the economy. 

&gt;**I'd argue that it's better to pay them to do that job and invest their time in our public services and infrastructure than it is to pay them to sit on the dole** 

Of course it does but that's not the point.  You're trying to stimulate the economy, remember?  Not that it makes more sense to have people in work than on the dole, nobody would argue against that, but you're saying rather than cuts stimulate the economy.  Well, you've got an awful lot of cuts to compensate for by stimulation and the ghost of Jimmy Callaghan is tapping you on the shoulder to remind you that you *do* have to pay for it.

&gt;**If someone keeps their job, they also keep spending, which is great for business.**

Why didn't anybody else think of it Holmes?  

They're not talking austerity for shits &amp; giggles, any government would love to announce unemployment as &lt;1%, they'd all love to be able to turn to all councils and say *'Spend as much as you want, it's good for business'.* 

They're talking cuts because they have to bridge the deficit.  You've said they don't need to cut councils, they should pay them more and bridge the deficit by stimulating the economy.  Fine: how do you stimulate the economy?  How much do you spend?  How do you pay for it?

You can't stop councils and highway/railway boards from putting out to contract because you'd crash local and national businesses.  You can't stop contracts going overseas whilst you're in the EU and you do have to pay for it.

I agree that public services should get more and there should be a tax overhaul but saying keeping people in public sector jobs and raising income tax will sort the deficit is a gross oversimplification and ignores all the ramifications.  Even if you do hire a load of workers, pay them out of a growing deficit, invest in infrastructure, adding more to the deficit you still have to make good on your investment and you've just hiked income tax, business tax and kicked the private sector in the gut.  You're not going to get a return  on your investment.  Creating jobs you're paying for and then saying that these wages will address the deficit is hardly going to work when they add to it and the private sector is less competitive.

In my neck of the woods at least, saying scone so it rhymes with cone is only done by people who are trying to hard to be posh (ie, posh people don't say it like that, only people who are trying very, *very* hard to be posh).

But, everyone I know from up north says that saying scone so it rhymes with gone sounds posh, and it's scone-as-in-cone.

I usually dislike having this arguement with people because, while it does annoy me when people say it so it rhymes with cone, I stop myself from being annoyed because I realise that it's not important, and I know what they mean no matter how they say it.

Saying that, the main reason I hate having this arguement is that there's always some smug bastard going ""no, it's scone, so it rhymes with *cone*, because you don't pronounce cone as con""

&amp; then an equally smug bastard will pipe up with ""No, you say it *scone* so it rhymes with *gone*, because you don't pronounce gone as goan""

We, the english, seem to as a collective, fail to realise that English speakers just pronounce shit different, and also using examples of similarly spelt words to back you up is usually a bad idea because there'll be about as many similarly spelt words that don't back you up seeing as different words with different roots will be said differently even with the same spelling.

It's important for inheritance tax to be high because the biggest reason for income inequality in everywhere is inheritance. The richest get to go to the best schools, get the best education and the best jobs, getting the most money which multiplies a lot quicker than others' money. Then they get to give it all to their family, who then go on and repeat the process.  
Inheritance tax is there to try and give everyone equal footing at the start - obviously it's not 100% effective, as your parents would have invested a lot in you before they're gone (hopefully), but the fact remains that inheritance tax is the most effective (and arguably the fairest) way to fix wealth inequality.

true,sync0pate,uk,West Mids,"&gt;the rich in this country enjoy taking value out of society that they could never possibly hope to contribute in return.

I specifically said *value*, not money. I'm talking about capitalism, whereby you have investment, and usury. Owning shares in a business or lending money contributes nothing of value, but still entitles you to a share of the reward.

&gt;I think it's very poor logic to argue that as long as there are poor people, there should be a limit to how rich a person can be.

It's not poor logic, it's an ideological disagreement. I would happily see the system change - whereby I would sacrifice my standard of living to raise others out of poverty - however I'm not going to do that alone. Firstly, because if it was just me who did so, it would make no difference. Secondly, because if I gave up all my modest wealth in the current system, I wouldn't have a decent shot at survival.

Rich people (investors, bankers, financiers, shareholders, landlords) ARE social and economic deadweight. I don't see how they can be explained as anything else.

There's not much of a story arc in classic Who.  Each story is fairly standalone.

Please please PLEASE don't skip Patrick Troughton (Second Doctor) just because his episodes are in black and white.  Admittedly, a LOT of his episodes are missing (almost his entire first two seasons), but the ones that still exist have turned him into my favorite Doctor.  Matt Smith's portrayal owes a lot to Troughton.

Season 1 with Hartnell (First Doctor) has a bit of a story arc, in that you see the Doctor change from kind of a prick to being closer to how he is today.  That's about it, though.

I'll try to do a list of highlights from the first two doctors' episodes - bear in mind I haven't seen Troughton's last season yet:

**Season 1** (First Doctor)

- An Unearthly Child
- The Daleks
- The Edge of Destruction
- The Aztecs

**Season 2** (First Doctor)

- The Dalek Invasion of Earth
- The Rescue
- The Romans
- The Chase
- The Time Meddler (first other Time Lord, though they weren't named at the time)

**Season 3** (First Doctor)

*from here on out, a lot of good/important episodes are missing; I'll list these, but make a note of their status, and why I've included them*

- The Myth Makers (all missing; companion departure/new companion intro)
- The Daleks' Master Plan (almost all missing, but great story; several companion departures and introductions, as it's 12 episodes long)
- The Massacre of St. Bartholomew's Eve (all missing; companion intro)
- The Ark
- The Savages (all missing; companion departure)
- The War Machines

**Season 4, Part 1** (First Doctor)

- The Tenth Planet (last episode missing; first regeneration, though it's not called that yet)

**Season 4, Part 2** (Second Doctor)

- The Power of the Daleks (all missing, but it's the Second Doctor's first story, how can you not watch it?)
- The Highlanders (all missing; companion introduction)
- The Underwater Menace (3 of 4 episodes missing; Jamie's real first full story as a companion, so I think it's important, but it can be skipped)
- The Faceless Ones (all but 2 episodes missing; companion departure)
- The Evil of the Daleks (all but 1 episode missing; companion introduction; great story)

**Season 5** (Second Doctor)

- The Tomb of the Cybermen
- The Abominable Snowmen (all but 1 episode missing; introduction of the Yeti, who come back in a much more important episode later)
- The Ice Warriors (2 episodes missing, but I like this story, and the Ice Warriors come back later)
- The Web of Fear (all but 1 episode missing; return of the Yeti; introduction of Brigadier (then-Colonel) Lethbridge-Stewart, who becomes a major character later)
- Fury from the Deep (all missing; companion departure)
- The Wheel in Space (all but 2 episodes missing; companion introduction)

*again, note that I have not watched beyond this point yet*

**Season 6** (Second Doctor)

- The Dominators (not sure how important this is, but it's a complete Second Doctor story, which is always good)
- The Mind Robber (see above; also, introduces the concept of the Void)
- The Invasion (2 missing episodes, which are available on the DVD in animated form; very good Cybermen episode, but not immensely important)
- The Seeds of Death
- The War Games (introduction of Gallifrey and the Time Lords; companion departure; second regeneration, sort-of; last B&amp;W episode)

""7.09pm: More news of the mystery bag belonging to Rebekah Brooks's husband which was found in a bin in an underground car park near the couple's home on Monday.

Charlie Brooks has said the bag – which contained papers and a lap top – is his and does not contain material connected with the phone hacking inquiry. My colleague Amelia Hill has a story on this soon. Here's a taste:

The Brooks's spokesperson David Wilson said that Charlie Brooks is currently ""disappointed"" that three days later, police are still refusing to return the bag but remains confident that, once they have established the bag is his, it will be returned to him.

""Police have been in touch and have asked for the passwords,"" he confirmed. ""Charlie was hoping it would be returned before now but he is adamant that it is his computer and that there is nothing on it that is Rebekah's and nothing that has anything to do with the case [into phone hacking].

""He hopes it will all be returned without much more delay. It is in their [the police's] hands now but Charlie is confident they will return it in the fullness of time,"" he added.""",0,1311279845,null,0,false,0,c273r6y,t3_it46k,t1_c273r6y,t3_it46k,1427374910,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

What I would argue is that when someone who appears on the sex offenders register who shouldn't be working near children starts getting paid by a school as a janitor it'd be flagged straight away if the transfer identifier carries a letter that denoted a school.  Same goes for anybody else working in other industries they shouldn't be working in.  Just a little something to inform the authorities to go and amicably check person X and to clarify what's going on - other than that no records kept other than by the person themselves.

true,Robincognito,cnty-england,England,"&gt; I specifically said value, not money.

Please define ""value"". Surely money is value in this context. I don't understand how it is wrong for people to have a lot of money when it is money that allows businesses to flourish and for new companies to be formed. In addition, so much innovation, technological, and medical advances come from investment from the rich. There is also charity; I know this is an extreme example but Bill Gates' foundation would never have been set up had he not been so wealthy.

&gt; I would happily see the system change - whereby I would sacrifice my standard of living to raise others out of poverty.

I can see that is essentially a capitalist vs. socialist argument, and therefore not something we can agree on. I would never accept a system change in which my standard of living was decreased. This is because in the (totally no guaranteed) event that everyone was brought out of poverty, what happens then? We only live once. Hypothetically, say I have an invention and I want to become really successful by bringing it to the market. What if I have dreams of travelling the world, visiting hundreds of countries? What if my idea of fun is having a really nice car to drive in or flying a private jet? Who are you to tell me I can't do that? Why should I be content living under a system whereby I am not able to do these things. As much as I value public services and a (sensible) welfare system, I'm pretty libertarian at heart. Money is a possession. The thought of a government taking more than a fair tax-share from someone's personal wealth is morally wrong in my mind; it also scares the living daylights out of me — very 1984-esque.

Before I leave this argument to rest, I understand that you think differently from me but I plead with you to drop the rich people-hate. I appreciate hard work and determination regardless of social class. When I was going through school, I met children from all sorts of backgrounds. I can tell you that I met kids from rather wealthy families as well as working class families. Some of the nicest, considerate, hard working people I became friends with had rich parents. They were polite and they were always determined to do well. Likewise, some of the kids from working class backgrounds were terrible human beings. They were racist, mean bullies, who never tried at school and had no respect for anyone else. Of course, both types of people existed for each social background but what I'm trying to say is that you are generalising when you describe rich people as deadweights. I could just as easily describe poor people as deadweights because they receive benefits but don't bother looking for jobs because they are happy scrounging off the government. However, since I'm not an ignorant Daily Mail reader, I don't hold that view. Generalisation is a horrible thing.

I get the impression that a socialist society, void of rich people, appeals to you because you are happy living a simplistic lifestyle. However, not everyone is content with living this way. In order to get people out of poverty without punishing those who are already successful, there needs to be more opportunities for young people to excel at what they are good at. The government should not be generating funds by raising taxes; they should be be encouraging hard work, creativity and enterprise so that the country produces skilled, determined adults who succeed in what they want to do. With more well-off people, the government has more funds to help people in poverty out of their situation.

Used to be almost a city—quite a port before the War of 1812—but all gone to pieces in the last hundred years or so. No railroad now—B. &amp; M. never went through, and the branch line from Rowley was given up years ago.

More empty houses than there are people, I guess, and no business to speak of except fishing and lobstering. Everybody trades mostly here or in London or Ipswich. Once they had quite a few mills, but nothing’s left now except one gold refinery running on the leanest kind of part time.

That refinery, though, used to be a big thing, and Old Man Marsh, who owns it, must be richer’n Croesus. Queer old duck, though, and sticks mighty close in his home.

He’s supposed to have developed some skin disease or deformity late in life that makes him keep out of sight. Grandson of Captain Obed Marsh, who founded the business. His mother seems to’ve ben some kind of foreigner—they say a South Sea islander—so everybody raised Cain when he married an Ipswich girl fifty years ago. They always do that about Portsmouth people, and folks here and hereabouts always try to cover up any Portsmouth blood they have in ’em. But Marsh’s children and grandchildren look just like anyone else so far’s I can see. I’ve had ’em pointed out to me here—though, come to think of it, the elder children don’t seem to be around lately.

By the same logic, I don't think I should have to pay for my stevie kit. Your initial point was 'why should anyone have to pay just to keep up with' which notes your lack of understanding of whats even on the table. Honestly, that one comment alone makes me feel you're the type to buy a $30 jersey from a random online store rather than shell out the retail price for an authentic one from the club's store; just because fans shouldn't have to pay that much.

I've used LFCTV for about 7 months, paying monthly, and I'm content with it. I think it's a small fee to part with for all of the content they provide. Even if you wanted to spend the entire first month trying to watch ALL of the matches, interviews and additionals from all competitions..you simply couldn't. It's got nearly the past decade of match content, along with a customizing tool that's pretty useful when you set the filters right. You can queue up videos of say..a specific player, and then set it to show you all clips (usually from about 30-80 seconds) for them. You can also further filter it to show all goals scored, shots, fouls, corners, etc. 

On top of all of the already-available content, there's the LFCTV channel itself which is live for something like 8-12 hours a day, not 100% on exactly how long it is everyday. I'm from New York and I'm pretty sure it started live for me from either 6am or 10am until maybe..5pm? I actually disabled it last month myself so I'm a bit hazy. I haven't had the time lately to follow closely (getting most of my summer news from here and google reader) and figured now is the best time to do it. 

All in all, I heavily recommend you try at least a month of it. The only downside I can note is that since I'm from the US (maybe other counties apply) the content from LFCTV wasn't available until 24 hours after it's broadcast, as were match replays. If there was a sunday match, I'd be able to watch the full 90 mins (or 40 mins, 15 mins, 90-seconds + anaysis and/or individual couple-min clips of the goals) at midnight on monday night. There were a few exceptions sometimes, but it was very reliable either way. Commentary from LFC greats as well, not like ESPN's american coverage or something odd. This is definitely MORE valuable if you don't have Sky and LFCTV to watch, as that adds several hours of content daily.

I bought freezer paper, which I only learned about 1 week ago (who knew!?). I cut out the basic shapes of the blue and black bits, then the white. Then you just place them where you want on the shirt and iron them on to make them stick (it's not permanent, and it's not a strong hold, so be careful not to dislodge the stencil). I did the blue layer first, let it dry, then the black then the white. What couldn't be done with the stencil I filled in with a paintbrush.

It got messy here and there, but I cleaned up where the ink bled, and I'm pretty happy with the result.

Viewed as a satirical and maybe cynical take on the news agenda in the UK at the moment there is nothing intrinsically wrong with the cartoon. Much of the media/Westminster village has been having a field day with the soap opera that watching NI fall apart has become.  Many in this country ( and here on Reddit) would never think to watch some European news channel, read LeFigaro or DerSpiegel, or the Irish Times: there's a lot more news happening than is covered in the (relatively tiny) British media bubble. 


**But**, the fact that it *is* in The Times, the ""prestige"" holding of NI in Britain, and the fact that's it's such a mealy-mouthed,  disingenuous and hypocritical (*viz* the front page), two fingers to the actual victims of this world is what makes it nauseating. The gulf between the front page and the editorial page just makes it even clearer that there is no real *moral* agenda at The Times- no more than there was at the NOTW. It's about selling rags, pure and simple, and breaking the law if nesessary to do so, and lying to a Parliamentary committee in the aftermath.  If knowing the difference between a press that has a broadly humanist ethical agenda and one which is engaged in a race to the bottom in search of the last loose quid on the planet is partisan, then I know which part I take.

1. Impossible Astronaut - Great episode. Love almost all of it. 
2. Day of the Moon - I thought the plot was a bit of a mess, exchanging coherence for shock, twists, and new locations. 
3. Curse of the Black Spot - Average filler episode. Empty Child/Doctor Dances on a pirate ship. 
4. Doctor's Wife - Another excellent episode. One of my top all time. 
5. Rebel Flesh/Almost People - Meh. What would have been an average filler single episode was stretched to two for the sake of Amy's big reveal. 
7. Good Man Goes to War - Good, not great. Moffat's standard ""I'll answer 10 questions but leave you with 15 more"" which I'm getting a bit tired of. The man just can't let a plot line finish. Also, he had 11 flirting dangerously close to Time Lord Victorious, which I really didn't like the first time around. (Sorry about the numbering, formatting isn't cooperating since I combined episodes 5 and 6 into a single point)

This is usually done at the end of the previous person's remarks and they generally promptly sit down when someone begins to speak. The speaker of the House (or deputy speaker) decides who gets to ask the next question unless the current speaker chooses to 'give way' during his speech/question in which case he can do so at his own discretion at anypoint, unless i think it's prime ministers questions in which case only the prime minister can give way and a standard MP cannot give way midway through a question.

Edit : The leader of the opposition can also give way during prime ministers questions if he so wishes, and i'm sure i've seen MP Bryant (rhonda) recently give way during a prime ministers questions, which makes me think anyone can give way at anytime but it's been a lil while since i studied parlimentary procedure. I'll have a little research in the morn and get back to you, now that the exact detail is annoying me.

£143k / 11 = £13k per week

£13k / 5 = £2600 per day.

They don't say how big the team is so we can only guess.  If we assume that he has a team of 3 people (plus him) then it works out at £650 per person per day.  Not an unreasonable daily rate for a financial consultant (it's roughly what my accountant charges me).  If he's got a team of, say, 7 then it's only £325 pppd. 

This team is tasked with making £21 million pounds in savings.  So the cost represents 0.68% of the projected savings.  Not bad.

Good.

Also good.

&gt; Peter Adams, from the Patient Action Group in Sussex, said: “I would have expected hospitals to employ people with the expertise to do this type of work instead of having to spend money asking independent experts to help.”

If the hospital was employing a full-time financial consultant with expertise in these matters then it would cost them *at least* £100k per year (assuming a £60k salary + £40k overheads to cover NI contributions, pensions, holidays, building costs, etc).  And that's every year.  Never mind what it would cost to have an entire team on permanent call.

true,wantonballbag,cnty-uk,United Kingdom,". Below I will go into more detail, but these are the main issues:

· there is a total absence of sound insulation between the two self contained flats which causes major noise problems (the problems are exacerbated by thin carpets and worn out underlay);

· there are issues with occupancy. The upper flat is a 3 bed maisonette, but I am sure that it is being used as a 4 bedroom as I regularly see up to 8 people leave in the morning. This means that the only reception room is the kitchen, which compounds the noise problems;

· the owner of the upper flat refuses to do anything to minimise the noise coming from his flat, or deal with the problems that have happened in the past. The flat is owned by a Swiss resident called Detlef Gartner (hereafter referred to as “he, him”, etc).

· there is also a long history of water damage from the upper flat, caused by a variety of problems;

· He is neglecting the upkeep of the property, many of the windows are rotten and he does not keep the gutters clear meaning that water runs down the walls

The noise mostly consists of impact noise from footfalls, squeaky floorboard, talking, (I can hear them talking through the floor and at one place I can see light from the upper flat), and any media which is not very low volume. One room in particular is uninhabitable when people are walking around. Most nights I am woken at least once by the front door being closed noisily. There is also a washing machine which when it spins, vibrates the ceiling and is extremely unpleasant.

To solve the problem I want him to replace his old, squeaky, thin and now defective floor with a new less noisy one, probably consisting of modern particle board flooring panels, screwed down and glued together and to cooperate with me in inserting foam sound insulation between the joists. Flooring panels of the type I describe have the additional advantage of being fire retardant, which the existing floor certainly isn’t.

I feel that he in fact wants to make his flat as noisy as possible and therefore to make my life as miserable as possible, so that I will move out, sell, then he could buy it, convert the house back into one unit, and then have a very valuable freehold house in (almost) Central London. The reason I believe this is because when I have raised the issue of noise in the past, his answer was that I should turn up my TV or go live somewhere else.

Background and History;

This is an old house, not of high quality when built, and now, the original floors are in very poor condition. The house is part of a terrace built just over 100 years ago. All the other houses in the row have had new floors fitted, incl. my flat, his is the only exception. I bought my flat in 1984, the conversion had happened in 1978, the upper flat was then owner occupied. Shortly after this, they sold to another family of owner occupiers, who stayed a few years, but then moved on and sold it to the present owner, who lived there a short while, then moved out and installed tenants, in other words it became a “buy to let”. Since that time, about 15-20 years ago, there has been an annual change of tenants. It is now in such poor condition that it can only be let to students.

There is a long history of water damage from the upper flat, caused by a variety of problems. Originally, when I bought my flat, both flats had plastic (not alkathene) mains water piping within the building. This is not suitable for mains pressure and is no longer used because it leaks. I immediately replaced mine. He didn’t, until I forced him to (I threatened to remove the cold water supply tube which was on my property and to poke the pipe up through the floor for him to reconnect). He sent his plumber round to do the work, which was eventually successful, but not without one more flood during the process. The leaks continued however, in two separate locations, below their kitchen and below their bathroom. (I have much evidence, in the form of some remaining stains on the ceiling (which was last painted about 3 years ago), and many photographs.

The problem with his front door is because of the way it was originally installed (looking from outside) it hinges on the left so that it impacts the frame on the right, which is a wooden party wall, meaning that the impact noise is heard throughout my flat. The simple solution is to rehang the door with the hinges on the right so that it would impact on the left, a brick wall. The problem is compounded by the fact that the door has no handle or any other pull, so the occupants have to stick their fingers into the letter flap, and pull, invariably letting the door bang. I once even offered to pay to rehang the door, but he prevaricated and obfuscated, so I gave up.

You may like to ask Herr Gartner what his advice is concerning noise from above. His solution is for me to “turn up my TV”. Check out the condition of the windows, it will be very expensive to heat this flat in winter. Ask him what I have said I will do in response to being woken at night. He is fully aware of all the problems but chooses to do nothing except take your rent. I constantly wonder why anyone pays him rent, if a tenant was to change the locks, there would be little he could do, at least in the short term.

He bought the flat about 15-20 years ago, and it is still in the same poor condition as it was then. He paid less than £70,000, so you can easily estimate how much profit he has accumulated, whilst making no improvements. I am convinced he uses his tenants to cause resentment.

The problems began in earnest when he announced that he was moving out and installing tenants. He knocked on my door and demanded that I contribute to his roof replacement project. I had never been asked to assess the problem, I had many problems with my own flat, I only had his word for it that this it needed to be replaced. However, at that time I was unemployed and so was not in a position to contribute. He went ahead anyway, but instead of sending me a bill, he told his contractors to leave the old slates on the roof patio, and that evening he shovelled them down into my back yard. As you will understand, this soured relations. Over the years there have been attempts at intimidation by his tenants and agents. He does not use a managing agent and recently has stopped responding to my emails.

true,[deleted],null,null,"£100-£120

Includes: Breakfast, lunch, dinner for myself, partner and our cat.

Includes: TP, Shower stuff, 'her' stuff, bleach, other misc household stuff.

Includes: 3+ bottles of wine, one for cooking, two for drinking, maybe some nice ciders or a few pints.

I feel very satisfied that we have a great food+drink budget. We sometimes reduce it, but it works out to about £50/£60 Each a week. Not excessive, we both work, pay our bills, enjoy life :)

Found my old posT:



Weekly food:


Stapes (pasta, rice, potatoes, bread, noodles) depending on what we fancy. (usually brown, often oaty), fajita wraps or tacos, sometimes cereals.


Liquids - vinegar (balsamic and rice), soy, oils (olive and peanut) / Obviously not ever week. Diet coke (missus insists on this)


Spices - constantly replenishing spice cuboard, usually in oregano, rosemary, paprika, turmeric, cumin seeds, dried chilli.(we have something like 30 or 40 spices, so it really depends on how much we use in that week.


Veg - usually peppers, spinach, onions, garlic, chillies, ginger, salad, courgettes, carrots. 
Sometimes we add/remove depending on special dishes. Often things like Leeks, asparagus, sweet potato, cabbage etc will come and go depending on our tastes at the time and for variety.


Fruit - Whatever is in season, although I have a fondness for Blood oranges when I can get them, raspberries and strawberries.


Meat - Mince (lamb or beef), usually a nice joint or a whole chicken, chicken breasts, sausages.
Fish - Salmon or Tuna steaks. Usually a can or two of tuna.


Dairy - 1pint of milk, medium block of cheese, ball of mozza, couple of hundred grams of good parmasan, eggs if we need them.


Booze - usually three bottles of wine, every few weeks I'll get a case of beer/cider. Every month or so we will get a bottle of spirits.


Essentials - our weekly grocery shop includes things like detergent, washing up liquid, soap, shampoo, cat litter, cat food.


We like to eat out a bit too - so we probably spend betweeen 30-70/pounds in eating out in a given week. usually a combo of a takeaway and a medium range resto.


I also often snack at work - I'll head to Waitrose to get some of their fresh olives (which are awesome incidentally) Orange juice, bananas sometimes, chocolate or crisps.


I'd say in total I spend quite a bit on food. However, cooking is one of my absolute passions and hobbies. I take my own food into work every day - and I cook a meal from scratch every night. (i've got a good repertoire now)


We shop at Tesco for our main food (Really - you should shop online? you don't? START.) We have tried Sainsburys and Ocado but find their online slots are always late - tesco are by far the best,
We shop at Waitrose for nice meats and specialist stuff.

I usually go to Tesco but I'll go to Sainsbury's or Waitrose if I'm passing instead.  Never Asda or Morrisons;  I tried both and the quality was terrible.  Tesco is pretty bad too now, but it's conveniently local.  I keep swearing I'll boycott Tesco, but I never do.

I have noticed 2 things about my shopping habits:

Firstly, I have no idea what any item costs.  Absolutely no idea.  I don't even look at the price on the shelf.   I couldn't tell you how much a loaf of bread or a pint of milk is.  It doesn't matter to me;  it's not like I'll put them back on the shelf if I don't like the price.  I need bread and milk, so in the basket they go.

I do look for 2-for1s and other deals, but not the actual price.   If there is no other way to choose between two similar products, I will work out the best deal (e.g. £/g) so I know which one to take, but I'll instantly forget the price once I've chosen.

The exception to this is booze.  I have a price-range for bottles of wine that I won't go under or over, and I know a good deal on generic lager is anything under £1/can for, say, Stella.  Proper ales I don't look at the price, I just choose the ones I like.

Secondly, I don't pay any attention to the final bill at the checkout.  I just hand over the plastic and keep packing.  I often get the car and think, ""I have no idea what that total was"".  I do pay attention when I clear piles of receipts out my wallet though, and I see my average supermarket trip is £80-120 and I'll do that every 5 days or so.

I had no idea it was so much more than most people (going by this thread anyway) spend.

EDIT:  This has really got me thinking.  It's not just food and drink, but includes all household stuff (cleaning products etc) and healthcare stuff (toothpaste, soap) but I'm sure everyone else is counting those too.  It would also include DVDs/BDs I guess, but I can't buy more than a dozen of those a year.  I'll bet booze is the culprit...

* So much leg room I (5ft 8) couldn't reach the chair in front. I was able to fit my massive rucksack under my legs as a leg rest.
* My massive rucksack would fit in the overhead if I wanted.
* Individual windows and arm rests, no fighting over having blinds or arm rests up or down!
* Smoking-permitted carriages.
* Seats recline so far back you wouldn't believe - also amazing Japanese etiquette in people always warning you when they're about to put the seat back, instead of just doing it and spilling your drink everywhere.
* Seats can rotate so if you want to sit in a group of 4 facing each other you can.
* Night train service has a lounge carriage with TVs, panoramic windows, comfy sofas at the end of some of the carriages.
* Electronic display offering full imformation about your journey, arrival times and weather for each station (in English too!)
* Typical Japanese customer service from the host/ess with good food on the trolley.
* At the station there are markers on the platform saying where your carriage will be, and a place to queue for where the door will line up.

Porn is free on the net.. Get a load of that each day, then either read a more fulfilling newspaper or magazine, or do something more constructive with your time. The end of *The Sun* is nigh, and you may well need something else to cling onto.

Position for position, the only two players in their squad I would take over us are Gerrard and Suarez. Their defense is awful (esp. their wing backs).

Man City is not good enough to contend for the title (yet). They have a single superstar player in Tevez, and he wants to leave. Yaya Toure is great, and I am fond of De Jong/Kompany, but they are two or three big signings away from competing with us. Man City fans wouldn't like me saying it (I think I am safe in this subreddit), but their squad at the moment is made up of mostly role players and some of the better players from some average teams. It is safe to say that they will splash some big money and change this soon, but at the moment, they are a solid top 4 or 5 team and nothing more.

We are going to be OK. We just finished a terrible, terrible season and still managed to finish second.

Reductio ad absurdum maybe? It could hardly be argued that locking someone in my basement and flaying them for a year could be called self defense or a flash of anger leading to an unfortunate turn of events.

&gt; If there is no evidence of this version of events and only evidence of the brain damage to the burglar and the quite magnificent beating then you can't really argue against the outcome. Do you not think it likely that upon realising they had gone too far, they concocted a worse version of events to justify their revenge?

I don't know the full details of events, but based on the quotes in the wiki it would appear that it wasn't in doubt. Neither Munir or Tokeer appear to have had any priors and the events during the raid don't appear to be in question. The only real contentious issues are the facts that the attackers retreated and were subsequently chased down and the degree of violence used in the beating.

&gt; If you keep a baseball bat with the specific intention of using it to beat someone who enters your home without your permission it will be seen as much worse than if you grab something near to hand and kill them with it.

Knowing Asians, the fact that they had a cricket bat so readily available isn't surprising.  A baseball bat would be harder to explain, as baseball simply isn't a game that people play that often in the UK. But finding a cricket bat in a British Pakistani's house would be as suspicious as finding a football in a English persons house.

&gt; You cannot simply say that whatever happens to a burglar is fair game if they burgle.

My view is that the man should have been prosecuted, as should all those who cause injury to those trespassing on their property.

As this is /r/unitedkingdom, I assume that most readers here are not in favour of a death penalty for any crime. From one perspective, this man who stabbed the burglar gave out his own death penalty, in direct contradiction with the view that no-one should die for their crimes. There was no trial or opportunity to defend his case: the burglar was stabbed, and died. He did not deserve to die.

I then say that the man murdered the burglar. He stabbed him with intent to cause him harm. This is a bad thing. This is not an ideal outcome. It is entirely possible, nay, probable that if the man had not confronted the burglars, no-one would have died. His stuff would have got stolen, and the police could catch the burglars later. No-one (except psychopaths) really wants to kill anyone for no reason. I don't think the burglars would have seen any reason to kill or injure the man if he had been submissive and stayed out of it.

But obviously the fact that there were burglars with machetes on his property would be a serious mitigating circumstance in his prosecution.

Not succinctly put, but I think I have conveyed my point. I have an hunch that this may be unpopular, so please explain before downvoting, thanks.",0,1311380382,null,0,false,0,c27d9w6,t3_iwqe4,t1_c27d9w6,t3_iwqe4,1427379453,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

Huh, my impression (as a non-English person who does like browsing the international press) was always that The Times was kind of a past glory kind of thing. 

As in: once, it was great, and legendary worldwide for it: *the* classic British newspaper. Now, meh, not so great anymore, and kind of forgotten abroad. 

There was one cafe in my home town where they had it, and I did always like reading their letters to the editor page for its sheer, quaint, upper/middle class Englishness. But its actual news pages are, to international standards (eg when compared to the NY Times, Le Monde, the FAZ or the Sueddeutsche, etc), mediocre. So much space taken up by petty news about crime, and international news stories that don't have an immediate English link seem generally relegated to half a column on page 12. All in all more shallow and insular than its equivalents in other countries like the above-mentioned papers. 

Hell, putting aside the issue of one paper's conservative and the other paper's lefty bias, The Guardian has much more depth and width than The Times nowadays, and its role in uncovering ever more info about the hacking scandal, which The Times seems long to have slowpaddled, is revealing it to have more bite too.

As for world fame, other than in that one cafe I mentioned I've never seen anyone outside England read The Times. I've seen non-British businessmen read the Financial Times, in an airport or on a train. I've seen wannabees in coffeehouses read The Guardian. But The Times, no.
