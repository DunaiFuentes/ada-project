true,Axius,uk,United Kingdom,"We owe it to ourselves as the society that these institutions exist to protect to have an acceptable standard in them. Not everyone in them is a murderer or a rapist as so many papers want you to believe.

If you want to 'reform' a criminal for a cash incentive, at what point do you stop and where are the lines drawn? It's a very dark path to tread on, when you're turning prisoners and the prison sector into cash commodities.

Even with a watchdog, there is no way that if this system went large-scale that ANY governmental organisation could monitor the treatment of every prisoner and we would be potentially letting in abuse of prisoners in the name of cost-cutting. Morally speaking, I would not be prepared to accept that.

What better way to promote prisoner reform than 'accidental' starvation perhaps due to an administrative error? Or that time they 'tried' to start a fight with one of the guards and ended up having to be restrained 'for their own safety'. There's way too many dodgy aspects to this, and if you start encouraging private businesses to both make a profit and at the same time not make a loss by encouraging offenders to not re-offend, I suspect things will start going wrong.",0,1301616214,null,0,false,0,c1n9kaj,t3_gfhj3,t1_c1n9kaj,t1_c1n6xkh,1427029533,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

It's ridiculous when you hear people who wish they had a disability so they could get DLA and not have to work. That's one scale of it. The other is this attitude that benefit claimants are abusing the system somehow, or that they should answer to the employed and be forced to find work. 

Solutions for the long-term unemployed to find work by the bitter employed are almost always intended to be some sort of circus show intended to force people into a situation like the workhouses of the 19th Century where the worst paid job is better than taking benefits.

I actually had one about River Song, though it was far more mundane. It was the night before last I believe.  I was watching the Doctor and he met a blonde woman with a hairdo less curly than rivers, but still long and wavy at the ends. This woman looked to be in her very early 20's and had no clue who the Doctor was or what he was doing, but she seemed friendly enough and interested in him.  

The dream was more like I was sitting on the couch watching an episode, though much larger in my vision than a television screen. I was still an observer though watching Doctor Who, not in it. The Doctor was curious about this woman but soon seemed to have a moment of realization about her and agreed to take her adventuring with him.  I realized as well at this moment that I must be seeing River's first encounter with The Doctor, though unlike the current state of things, the Doctor seemed extremely knowledgeable about her, as if they had been on many more adventures than we are currently up to now.  He had known her for years or possibly decades of his time, but she was just meeting him, and he let her come on as a companion because he knew where it would lead.

true,jerry111,null,null," Dr. Who ranges anywhere from silly to dramatic, suspenseful to comedic. It is, however, usually uplifting and the most fantastical of the scifi fantasy currently on tv.  episodes of dr. can sometimes be so different in terms of tone so it's hard to pick any single episode that is characteristic of the series as a whole.

p.s. although the show contains a lot of standalones there's usually an underlying storyarc to each season that slowly develops in the subplot until the rousing conclusion, so i wouldn't recommend watching random episodes at a time, Not to mention the constant switching of Doctors and his companions could add to the confusion.

true,[deleted],null,null,"Well, I mean, you seem to have a pretty strong stereotype of prisoners as habitual offenders who happened to finally get caught, and that providing an environment that they hate is the best way of preventing crime. It's a disincentive, but I'm sure you know how those work in the light of Pavlov's work on conditioning - and empirical measures from the past decades regarding crime rate and sentence length.

I later started two charities in China, finished my course winning medals for highest exam performance, and won a large grant for my PhD. I slipped up once, got to see some pretty interesting things, and that was that.

The problem with the government run places is that there is reduced focus on rehabilitation and no incentive to give prisoners an alternate lifestyle, or to provide things like cognitive therapy to adjust their reflexes. Giving cash rewards for reducing crime, and penalties for poor prisoner behaviour, is a wonderful way of running prisons.

On the other hand, the privately run places provided intensive training and pastoral care, and had far fewer bribable guards. Courses were effective, and the smaller ones were located nearer to homes where family could visit, keeping prisoners invested in their local community and society. Drug usage was also much lower in these.

Take for example http://www.hmpwolds.co.uk/about_rar_las.asp .

What would you consider conclusive? The Guardian's recent article was pretty lacking, and seemed more like an anti-privatisation piece (generally fine in principle) and a platform for a union leader to display some of their more extreme ideas (this isn't the thirties).

I fear that many have an opinion that prison is there to punish offenders, and not to remove people from society that are a risk to it. The latter is the case - and why we have, for example, removed capital punishment from our country. It's vastly more productive, humane and ethical to, when someone has erred, find out what has caused their behaviour, and try to help them see the light of day, all the time keeping them in a safe place until an improvement is made. It sounds a little Clockwork Orange (that or outrageously hippy), perhaps, but re-offence is extraordinarily expensive in both detention and opportunity costs.

So given that, the new prisons will either be better funded which we could do in-house or they will be funded the same and either as good or worse in terms of results than the current prisons.

I also worry that our last and currents governments habit of bending over and spreading-them for big business means that this decision is more about ideology than practical or economic benefit and I worry that with large companies involved in the prison system, we will not be able to reduce prisoner numbers which should be our current goal.

I guess that sums up why I am opposed.

Punishment isn't anything compared to the regret you might feel for your actions. For example, if you reversed over a toddler and were given 4 years for reckless driving, I doubt that being lashed each day (extreme example) and feeding you nothing but bread and water would be anything close to the beating you'd be giving yourself. As for individuals who are remorseless, the punishment really aids institutionalisation - a practice also present in all army training - the dehumanisation of ""the other party"". If the convicts don't see the guards as human, they won't care about how they are treated, and can easily rationalise and dismiss the punishment. As a last word, the length and duration of punitive measures or an exclusion from society have rapidly dimishing returns. After being in for a year, I could have easily done five or six more without too many problems; one can easily lose sight of the world outside and fit into a very repetitive and simple daily pattern with limited variation in interaction. If one is lashed every day for a year, I am sure they will have coping mechanisms in place by then to be able to deal with another year's worth. So - why bother using the length of the punishment as a metric for anything at all?

You're totally right about the ideology of governments being cause for concern. Privatisation didn't work with the railways, either. This is possibly one of the only things I'm pro-privatisation on simply because the state system is performing so much worse.

true,Axius,uk,United Kingdom,"The worst paid job is not always better than benefits, and that is not always purely due to money. This is my point. It is not a case of money but the experiences of the individual on these schemes that matters, in my opinion.

The worst paid job, the literal worst job in terms of conditions and pay, should not be the baseline by which to determine the standards that benefit schemes should match. You find that the employed are happy to play this game of 'get a job you dosser' and slash away at support for the unemployed until they find themselves in a dead-end situation when their opinion suddenly becomes one of 'help me please'. Today's society is too much about personal gain against an aura of expectation. People want to have their taxes cut, they want to have more of their earnings and towarsd that end they expect people to live the same lifestyle as them and they expect everyone to 'pull their weight'. Perhaps it's fair, perhaps it's not, but it's certainly questionable as to how right it is that people want to project their discontent onto the unemployed/poor.

Would a bankrupt former CEO of a failed organisation that collapsed during the recession as a result of actions not his fault be running to join the queue to clean toilets? I doubt it. We as a society would also probably feel he is justified in not doing so because he's 'qualified to do better'. We are quick to jump on people such as former shop managers or cashiers though for not doing it, and as such there's a sense of duality between those who deserve to be hounded and those we feel don't deserve to be.

Who are we to judge when we would very likely do the same as them in their situation?

As such, the experience of benefits should thus be of an acceptable minimum. Courses and placements should be of an acceptable standard, and should not try dehumanise or otherwise bully the unemployed into filling positions. We wouldn't want that to be inflicted upon us and we shouldn't feel we have a right to do so to others.",0,1301681855,null,0,false,0,c1ndh6d,t3_gfqda,t1_c1ndh6d,t1_c1ncib5,1427031452,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

They're armoured killing-machines, which makes them scary, but in their role as racist genocidal space Nazis they often turn up in vast armies, which makes any _individual_ Dalek into an anonymous mook to be wiped out by the heroes.

So what happens is: One Dalek trundling along a corridor after the Doctor and the assistant du jour, shouting EXTERMINATE at them? Terrifying. Millions of Daleks swarming about all over the place? Meh.

I mean, remember when there was just the four of them [escaping from Torchwood HQ](/spoiler)? They were scary. OK, their summit meeting with [the Cybermen](/spoiler) was kind of cheesy but it was still awesome, they were just, screw you, we don't care how many of you there are, we're Daleks, EXTERMINATE. They cut their way through [Torchwood and the military and the Cybermen](/spoiler). Unstoppable and terrifying. But when the whole sky was full of Daleks? Then it's just got silly.

The best Dalek episode for the newbie would be, well... _Dalek_, from the Ninth's era. One Dalek, on its own, in a bunker with lots and lots of corridors to chase people along. Perfect.

Unfortunately the TARDIS is old and has not been particularly well maintained over the relative years. The TARDIS's space tends to form short-lived quantum wormholes to the... well, it's not strictly _nearest_ because there's not a true space in which to define a distance but there's a hyperdimensional abstract parameter space in which a distance function can be defined in eleventh-dimensional matrix algebra and that's what we mean, so _nearest_ point in the actual manifold of the brane corresponding to the Universe. The making and breaking of these wormholes forms highly intense gravity waves which, er, make the TARDIS interior rock back and forth.

My reasoning is twofold:

Firstly I understand the argument that the principle of one person one vote is sacrosanct, and this is how the system has worked for as long as we have had a parliamentary democracy. However my view is this argument is based on sentimentality and lacks reason, so however much it ‘feels’ right, it avoids the actual question, which is “is the current system fair?”.

First past the post may have worked in a time when less of the population had the vote, and indeed less of the population could read or write, but today this system provides government supported by 30% of the electorate. In what way does this equate to parliament representing the views of the population as a whole?

Secondly, the constituency in which I live is a safe seat, and has been since bears have been shitting in the woods. Therefore under first past the post if I do not intend to vote for the incumbent party I am disenfranchised. Under the current system my vote does not count. This is not an emotional response, it is a fact. This does not make sense, and I would like to see it changed.

true,iamplasma,null,null,"&gt; Firstly I understand the argument that the principle of one person one vote is sacrosanct, and this is how the system has worked for as long as we have had a parliamentary democracy. However my view is this argument is based on sentimentality and lacks reason, so however much it ‘feels’ right, it avoids the actual question, which is “is the current system fair?”.

While I agree with the overall sentiment, I'm rather concerned that you even accept this as being a violation of the ""principle of one person one vote"".  As far as I can tell, this is just a slogan that has been invented by the No campaign on the basis that it's catchy and likely to stick in the minds of most people who don't investigate the proposal at hand.

AV doesn't give anyone more than one vote, or at least it doesn't give anyone more votes than anyone else (with the exception of people who don't number all options, whose vote can be voluntarily exhausted at a certain point).  At each ""round"" of counting every vote is counted once.  It may be that some people's votes ""fall through"" more often than others, but I don't understand how that could be said to violate the principle of one man one vote.  That principle means that everyone gets an equal voting entitlement, not that those votes have to go through a FPTP system.",0,1301698124,null,0,false,0,c1neoj2,t3_ggmnm,t1_c1neoj2,t1_c1necjo,1427032020,5,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,5

As for the other options, approval votes necessarily require tactical thought, requiring people to consider whether they're going to harm their first choice's chances if they want to aid their second choice.  Similarly, proportionate representation necessarily lends itself to extremely weak governments with enormous amounts of horse trading.

They also have lots of movies and tv shows available to stream for free if you're a Prime member. I actually like Amazon's streaming service better than Netflix's--it's better quality. However Netflix has far more options available for streaming.

At .99 cents a pop I think you can afford do buy the episodes legally.

true,palehorse864,null,null,"If they ever had an American doctor they would have to lampshade it immensely. The new Doctor would say his first words in an American accent and then catch himself before saying something distinctly British like ""Well, that's a bit rubbish"" in a full on American accent.

A few episodes later we would see him yelling at or fussing at the Tardis while laying under the console trying to fix the translation circuit, even though there is nothing wrong with it.  He's just refusing to believe he regenerated with that accent.

Another episode might see him in his private study trying to fix his accent with language tapes that speak in a British accent. 

As for what I really would like to see though, I don't think I ever want to see the Doctor get a sex change in regeneration, that would just be weird. It was a funny gag in Curse of the Fatal Death, but I don't think it would really go over well in the real show. A female timelord who is as smart as The Doctor and maybe gets her own show wouldn't be objectionable though, or bringing someone like Jenny back as a companion. I think previous history weighs even more poorly on the idea of the Doctor swapping sexes after 11 regenerations or so. 

I honestly wouldn't mind seeing the Doctor get a bit more melanin in his skin though.  A black Doctor or even an eastern looking Doctor wouldn't be bad, whether that would mean Arabic, Asian, or what have you.  

What would be really fascinating to me would be a Doctor who is Native American in appearance, particularly if he was an older looking Doctor.  In fiction there's been a rather common use of the idea of the ""wise old indian chief"" or someone to that effect. What if the Doctor ended up like that for a regeneration. I think he would have to be a bit more like the Seventh was with Ace, being a sage teacher to younger companions and sharing profound truths of the universe. 

Edit: Speaking of which, I hope that this series isn't the last time Eleven will visit America. I really want to see him go back in time and meet the real Geronimo. Although it probably never really happened, there was a story of Geronimo evading US troops by jumping from a cliff supposedly into a river. Imagine if he was trying to evade capture and dove off a cliff right to where the Doctor had the TARDIS waiting to save him.

It's just our strange way of doing humour that makes its way into the narrative. Again the best example of this is Sherlock Holmes the BBC TV series. It wasn't really a comedy in any capacity but it had these subtle moments of comic relief.

A large part of Doctor Who is being able to pull off the competent leader while also being reduced to a bumbling fool.

Things can move from the exterior shell to the interior. People, air, thrown objects, and all manner of things come in and out the front door of the TARDIS. What if the Doctor allows certain energies and forces, such as kinetic energy and such to travel through the closed doorway. The stabilizers or whatever simply shield these things from getting through, but the Doctor has less fun in that case.  One thing Doctor Who has done for the most part is to leave the characters a safe place.  The TARDIS is hardly ever invaded, and generally when they are in the TARDIS the Doctor and his Companions are safe.  The Star Trek series always had threats to the ship, or invaders beaming aboard to attack the crew directly, usually killing a few red shirts. The TARDIS often remains a safe zone for the Doctor, and even in the worst of crashes, such as the space titanic with the shields down, he is only knocked out of his chair and the damage is quickly repaired.

true,palehorse864,null,null,"I kind of like to think of the nightmare child as a creature that influences your dreams. The nightmare child has foresight of the future but is not always honest. It appears as a young child who seems innocent enough and warns you about something terrible that is going to happen. The nightmares are often prophetic in that these things may happen and the warning allows you to stop it. 

The sinister part is that many times the prophetic dreams are false on their own, but if the person who has the dream tries to prevent it from happening, it becomes a self fulfilling prophecy. The thing they tried to prevent, they end up causing. The nightmare child tries to destroy people by leading them to destroy themselves, or those they care about in this way. 

The other part of it is that sometimes the dreams are genuine warnings. Something bad is going to happen and the nightmare child warns them. If they ignore the warning, it is almost certainly going to happen. If they heed the warning, they can prevent it. That is what is insidious about the whole thing. 

Keep in mind, these are just my imaginings, but I picture the nightmare child, at least in this scenario, having played a pivotal role in the time war. The nightmare child would have invaded the dreams of Davros, or the emperor Dalek and showed them the destruction of the Dalek race.  Whenever Rassilon showed up in the time war, the Nightmare Child would have invaded his dreams at some dark hour to show him the destruction of Galifrey and the Time Lords.  Rassilon would have heeded this warning and would begin to research a way to save the Time Lords, leading the Doctor to have to stop him. 

The Doctor would have similarly disturbing dreams, foreseeing the destruction of Earth while being urged to prevent it as he has many times before.  The Doctor being wiser though wants to know if what he saw is true and eventually decides to not heed the vision and laughs in the nightmare child's face (I believe that part was mentioned in one of the IDW comics).  The Doctor leaves Earth alone for once and is correct in doing so, but Rassilon causes his own dream to come true, as well as the Dalek emperor (or Davros') dream. 

Now, the nightmare child's physical form would be something else entirely, the image of the child possibly a girl named Cassandra (no not THAT Cassandra, this http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cassandra  Cassandra). The actual physical form could remain offscreen and mysterious, something big, big enough for a command ship to fly into the jaws of as was said elsewhere,  but the on screen form would be the child that inhabits dreams.

The Doctor is an alien with two hearts and who knows how many other physical and other differences to human beings. This 'male character' you speak of sounds human. Maybe Time Lords who reach the age of 1,000 turn female for their next regeneration. Maybe they grow a second head and turn to a life of crime, stealing starships. Or maybe they degenerate into the Gallifreyan equivalent of asexual chimps.

My point: He's a friggen alien, not a human male! Anything could happen.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt; Or am I wrong? Is anyone else with a residential ISP connection getting anything close to reasonable (5Mbit/s up, at least)?

No. Because none of the widely deployed residential broadband standards support it. ADSL supports about 1Mbit up max, ADSL2+ 1.3Mbit, ADSL2+ Annex M seems to top out at 2.5Mbit, DOCSIS and DOCSIS 3 can go higher but then you run into problems with oversubscription. ""Reasonable"" is subjective. Most people have no need for anything above 1Mbit upload, and for that reason ISPs and standards organisations/equipment R&amp;D don't really bother trying to push the boat out. Download speed is what matters (or more accurately, it's what people look for).

BT's new VDSL-based products will go to 2Mbit or 10Mbit (depending on how much you pay and if your ISP will let you. My ISP is offering the 10Mbit upload for only a few pounds more per month).

What did you have in Germany? It probably wasn't any of those standards (it might well have been cable, so DOCSIS based)

Be should be faster, although I seem to recall that their ""value"" tariff isn't the full 1.3Mbit that the other packages have (except Pro which is Annex M so 2.5Mbit).",0,1301757012,null,0,true,0,c1nh36m,t3_gh2nb,t1_c1nh36m,t3_gh2nb,1427033154,9,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,9

1) He certainly did. As good as he looked, he looked pissed. He understands as much as anybody the injury is killing us. ALL of our quality defenders are out (agger and johnson.... ;__;). He understands, but he still wants a trophy. Today's loss will certainly factor into his decision this summer. 

2) Spearing is garbage. You can't even really argue that he'll improve in time. The level that he plays at now (at the age of 22) isn't high enough to EVER become a class player. He is at best a squad player at West Brom. Why would we loan out Pacheco when we are plagued by injury and lacking man-power. I understand we needed some defensive shoring up after our 2 best available fullbacks get subbed out, but I think even Poulson would have been a better move. I don't like Spearing and I simply don't think he's good enough. Moussa Sissoko: please save us.

3) Carroll - He looked great until he got the yellow and even then until he got the second talking-to. He didn't want to get a red so he played cautiously. For him and the way he plays, cautious means worthless. Give him another chance. I think his reckless abandon will do fine next week

However, there have been games where he has been brilliant, think about the United match a few weeks ago.

In the end, he's about what you expect as a fourth choice centre back. He's only going to play when absolutely necessary, and once we get some proper fullbacks we won't need him anymore. Players who are younger and better than Kyrgiakos wouldn't put up with sitting on the bench most of the time. Also, once Danny Wilson matures a bit we'll have him as a centre back.

&gt;THE RULES OF THE GAME:
&gt;
&gt;2.8 Hours Later is a type of chase game where players have to move from base to base across a wide area (ie a city centre) without being caught by a group of chasers. At each base the players collect proof they have been their (a stamp, mark or token) and the position of the next base in the sequence.

&gt;For 2.8 Hours Later specifically: Starting from a secret location all players will be sent off en masse on a journey across the city to more secret locations. In between locations there will be zombies chasing players. Being caught by a zombie does not necessarily mean you instantly become one of them but your objective is to stay alive and get to safety.

&gt;A more detailed introduction to the rules will be given to you before you play. We don't want to give away too much just yet and spoil the terror for you!

A few of the main reasons we don't:

* It looks good to appear hard on drugs. Most people know drugs are harmful and aren't aware of alternatives to prohibition. Politicians are prevented from having logical discussion about alternatives by the mail, the sun and their ilk.
* There are a lot of people whose livelihoods depend on drug enforcement. Police get considerable funding for meeting their targets, and one of those is drug convictions. It's not a small one.
* As I mentioned before, the newspapers will happily print sensationalised stories about drugs because it sells papers. Positive stories do not. The people like to hear what they're expecting to hear. Change is unwelcome unless they want change, and they don't know they want it until they're educated about it.

I think it's clear at the time that it was expected that she would know an older *Tenant* Doctor; otherwise she'd know right away that it was an earlier incarnation, not Matt Smith's Doctor.  She even goes on to say how young he is.  Now, you can handwave this after the fact, perhaps talking about Time Lord insight (they have a funny way of recognizing other Time Lords) or whatnot, but clearly if all her adventures were with Eleven and later doctors, she would know right away that the Tenth wouldn't be in her diary.  Nevertheless, she pulls out her diary and asks about Byzantium, which didn't happen until the Eleventh, and then she turns her diary back *earlier* and asks about the picnic in Asgard, which must be a meeting before Byzantium but which has never been chronicled.  But that could have come anywhere in the Doctor's timeline.

Anyway, the point is clearly she was meant to have other encounters with Ten, and when Eleven came along, they just moved the Byzantium story.  But it's entirely possible she had other adventures with Ten that are in her diary that we simply never saw on screen.  This is the best explanation why she didn't know right away that Ten wouldn't be in her diary at all.

Unfortunately, the railways are tied up in lots of regulation. The train companies and Network Rail (which is run as a private company despite its public ownership) can't even think about sneezing without the DfT making a decision on it.

If we're going to keep privatisation, we should at least provide more freedom to do what they want (within reason). An example is the Intercity Express project. The DfT is micromanaging it by forcing Hitachi to build a couple of token assembly plants to put together Japanese-made parts.

Also this has not been proven conclusively that cannabinoids have psychologically addictive properties, but is has been proven that they do not cause physical addiction

I've seen people who couldn't function without being high. There was nothing wrong with them other than not being high and getting aggravated about it. 

&gt; I believe this is only due to the fact it is illegal. Again, no cannabinoid has been shown to actually trigger paranoia in the brain.

Legality isn't a concern. The paranoia I've seen seems to stem from a feedback loop of over analysis of every action or thought.

&gt; There have been countless studies proving that driving under the influence of cannabis is not a danger to the general public, although it is responsible to advise against this.

I've seen a tv show where people scored higher on a road safety test after a joint, but what's the limit? One joint? 2 joints? A night of smoking?

&gt; This is an issue only with strains with high THC levels.

Or smoking lots of weed on a regular basis, I certainly noticed problems when I was smoking 1/2 Oz a week to myself.

&gt; easily dealt with by ingesting a variety of strains, as well as trichromes aka Hashish, tinctures and edibles.

Which is fine and dandy if you have access to a huge range of different types of weed, and know how to manage this. Most people don't put so much effort into getting high.

&gt; using Cannabis is not for everyone, but even then they will be uncomfortable for a few hours, with no risk of toxicity or death.

Toxicity and death are pretty much none issues with weed, but some people I've known took a lot longer than a few hours to put their lives back together after getting into a serious thing with weed. And a problem was that like any addiction it wasn't something they we really aware of until they had been off the stuff for some time. You do have to understand, my argument isn't that it's bad, just that it's wrong to ignore the fact that it isn't harmless. It's something the pro-legalization lobby tends to gloss over, and I think that if we want to see serious progress made on sensible legislative moves towards and end to prohibition we need to deal with.

If the target was to get as many people into permanent well paid work, for instance, then that would be a worthwhile measure of success and worth aiming for. The problems occur when the only targets stem from a petty effort to save money.

Targets are not as good as individual outcomes. If you stick to them to rigidly then you dehumanize the whole process. Which is the issue, the job centers are treating people like things rather than people.

&gt; That is how the current New Deal/Work Programme is operated, with lots of private/independent providers. The standards are a postcode lottery, there is next to no oversight, no common appeals procedure for mistreated people, the system is wide open to abuse and fraud by the providers, and I bet the bureaucracy and cost involved in coordinating the service is far worse than doing it all in house.

No necessarily privatized, just decentralized. I think there is something to be gained by moving the decision making process for things like targets as close to the communities they are dealing with as you realistically can.

The legalisation of drugs, in this case weed, needs to be handled with a great deal of care. It's too often just pushed by the users to be a straightfoward case of 'yeah make it legal so we can smoke it without being arrested' which is largely a relatively selfish and ignorant view of the reasons and motivations behind legalisation.

Taxation is one, which will take some time to work out given that people grow their own. I suspect if it was legal to use, it would be illegal to grow and start as a 'state monopoly' at first. Obviously, I don't have insider knowledge.

Distribution and control, a legal minimum age, all that will have to be legislated in. Regardless of all this, the current market will still exist as the 'cheaper' alternative, perhaps imported from abroad or something. Most drugs outside of alcohol exist inside and outside the system. Tobacco for example, can be imported from abroad and bought cheaper than retailers here for personal profit.

My major concern with legalisation of weed is not about the conditions of the people using it. Whilst I think about it, at the end of the day that use is up them. I do not, however, like the 'passive' element of weed that almost every user I've come across imposes on their immediate audience while they smoke it. The smell of it gives me a very sharp headache that I would rather avoid. Other people too may find it offensive. As such, it would end up being more regulated than smoking is right now due to the nature of it. I doubt it would ever be legal to walk down the street smoking weed.",0,1301790389,null,0,false,0,c1njbi2,t3_gh3zm,t1_c1njbi2,t1_c1nhrpq,1428204660,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

true,Decka17,lfc68,null,"The game just highlighted our frailty in defence. If you analyse our defence, it needs a major overhauling. We have:

Glen Johnson - Great in attack as we know, but not the best defender. Ideally, he should be the weak link in our defence due to attacking runs and our defenders cover for him, but often gets exposed due to Carra's pace.

Jamie Carragher - Still a good defender, positionally superb, but getting on and has no pace whatsoever anymore, but he still needs to be in our defence for his leadership and stability. He should NOT be playing at RB, but he's 3rd choice.

Martin Kelly - Best out of defence this season, decent at going forward and defensively solid at both CB and RB. However, is starting to look a little injury prone.

Daniel Agger - Great CB on his day, absolutely the class we need at LFC, but we all know those times come few and far between long streches out with injury. At this point its a hard decision about Agger, as we can't afford to have our best CB out so frequently, so its either he sits on the bench as a backup to a good replacement or we move him on. Fun fact: Daniel Agger has played 93 times in the EPL for us in 5 years, not much better than Aurelio's 85 in the same time.

Martin Skrtel - I have sometimes been a bit hard on him and he was pretty good against WBA, but he's inconsistent and for a defender thats a liability. He gives away needless fouls, gets caught out often and isn't a sure header of the ball, but he works hard and when he's having a good game he's solid. Bit like our Dirk Kuyt of defence.

Soto Kyrgiakos - Was okay last season, has been poor this season. He's good in the air but not on the ground, which is...woeful for a CB. Slow, reckless and has time against him, we should move him on.

Fabio Aurelio - Class man of glass. Not much else to say really, he should NOT be our FIRST choice LB!

Danny Wilson - Good young player but doesn't look ready for EPL level yet.

In the perfect FM-esque world, we'd sell Kyrgiakos, Aurelio, and perhaps Agger, bring in 2 excellent CBs and 2 new LBs and move Carragher to the bench. Skrtel is good enough for 3/4rd choice.

true,waterweed,null,null,"Yeah, the bulk of the Doctor's involvement seems to have happened right before Eight regenerated into Nine. It's a little bit more complicated than that, though. 

IIRC some of the supplementary material claims the Time War refers to the conflict between the Daleks and the Time Lords as a whole, with the Tom Baker episode 'Genesis of the Daleks' (watch it, trust me, it's one of the best of the Old Who) representing the first shot in the war. Relatively speaking. 

So, basically, you have an ongoing, crosstime conflict that may have been going on since the time of the Fourth Doctor, if not before.  Sometime in the Eighth Doctor's lifetime, this flares up into the massive Time War, which the Doctor ends, destroying both sides and putting the whole thing behind a time lock. 
The Eighth Doctor almost certainly regenerated into the Ninth when he ended the war. And then he goes on to clean up a few bits of the war that got around the time lock (the Master, Davros, the events of the End of Time). 


Of course, this is probably not a good time to mention that there's a completely *different* time war that was featured in some of the Eighth Doctor novels.  The whole thing was rather surreal, and involved a nameless enemy who was most certainly *not* the Daleks, a rogue Gallifreyan Voodoo cult, and somebody named Grandfather Paradox.

I don't know what the cause is.

Independence I think?

Americans ...**I think**... before 9/11, saw them as freedom fighters, fighting for independence and a life apart from Britain.
I think they were reminded of their own struggle for independence?

Then 9/11 happened, and it gave many Americans an understanding on HOW they were fighting for independence, and they realised it was an immoral way.

Maybe they are fighting for a cause? I imagine standing alone is something most people can understand about their own lands?

The way they're fighting though...

Because he'd be affecting things that already happened. Say he goes back to before a point A: anything post A will change which is a Very Bad Thing. There isn't any point he can go back, change things and not affect the future in *some* way. The Doctor's problem is that he can't arrive there by TARDIS.

See, he accesses chapters of her life by the windows the androids create. Interestingly, the Androids are doing a linear search. Moffat thought of this. Had the Doctor been arriving at points A, then E, then B in her life - all over the place - instead of seeing her grow in jumps - he could've saved her. But he's accessing her life at points like A, B, E, J, K - in an order. There simply isn't a point where he can arrive where he can take her to a place that's, you know, very far away. The closest thing is a mirror that's 5 years away from Game Day, and he chooses not to live that; since he then enters her timestream on Game Day, he can't go between those two points anymore because the second point would be affected.

The tragedy is that the last window jumps in time. There isn't a point where he can go back at all now - even in his TARDIS - because he finally enters her timestream after she dies. In his timestream, she never saw him again. Had he *not* gone back throw the last window and simply gone to the day he saw her last in his TARDIS, he'd have seen her again. That was, however, his mistake.

We tend to think that Britain has been a democracy for hundreds of years, but when power was taken from the monarch it was transferred to parliament, representative of the aristocracy, and not to the common people. And the second transfer, from the aristocracy to the people, is still very much ongoing. It is only a decade since hereditary peers made up a majority of our second chamber, and 90 still sit there today. General male suffrage was only granted in 1918, and universal suffrage ten years later. And private school pupils are still massively overrepresented in the best universities, which then produce the majority of politicians, civil servants, members of the judiciary, and more generally the professional classes. 

Regarding the current government, both David and Samantha Cameron are scions of banking families. It can't be sensible for someone whose family benefited directly from the previous deregulation of the banks, who are presumably still heavily involved in the financial industry, to decide the legislative agenda following the biggest financial screwup in 80 years. It is simply not realistic to expect that level of detachment. Would you be responsible for destroying the wealth of yours and your wife's family, even if it was in the national interest?

Having made such a populist point, I'm going to blot my copy-book by saying that at present this problem is as much about the failure of public primary and secondary education as it is about entrenched privileges. There are a series of blunt facts that need to be accepted. Firstly that students learn at different speeds, depending on their ability and their enthusiasm. Secondly that putting bright and enthusiastic students together creates, in general, a better educational culture. Thirdly that the top members of society, the professors, judges, CEOs, ministers, parliamentary secretaries etc. are inherently an elite.

In response to your questions:
1. Honestly I'm rather under-informed as well. We have some songs we sing, we seem to prefer waving flags to the traditional scarves. Fulham gets talked up as our rival (the West London derby, etc) but that's not really true. Chelsea is a big deal for Fulham, but not the other way around. Man U is probably our biggest rival just because of all the contentious matches (so pumped for Wednesday!!!), Liverpool hates/mocks us lately because of Torres. Arsenal and Tottenham are big too, just because they are nearby. Someone else will have to handle traditions, I don't know that much.

BTwholesale does not traffic shape. Things slow down when exchange contention happens, but that's more to do with BT's unwillingness to fix their network rather than network management. That affects BT's own retail customers just as it affects other ISPs.

As someone who is not on a BT-owned ISP but uses BTwholesale's ADSL network, I have not experienced traffic shaping - either by my ISP (who doesn't shape anyway) or by BT. I get problems with exchange contention but, once again, that isn't really traffic shaping. I can download at full speed whenever I want, which since I connect at the full 8Mbit is about 6.8Mbit after overhead. Can't complain with that. Certainly not ""&lt; 0.5Mb"" that you allege.

If you have proof of what BT is allegedly doing, send it to Ofcom and/or the EU authorities. They'd be very interested; since it is not something BTwholesale is allowed to do.

BT has already pretty much made the LLU operators reconsider their plans by rolling out fibre to the cabinet/home. Why put DSLAMs in exchanges when BT might suddenly make it obsolete with something better that you can pay to use instead?

&gt; Plus it's to discourage other phone providers from going the non-LLU route.

BT's charges for using their ADSL network (IPstream or WBC) are astronomical - with WBC being slightly less so. Why would BT want to actively stop people from paying them these astronomical sums of money - sums that are likely to be very profitable for them?

They'd rather people pay to use their network than go the LLU route which is more hassle and much less profitable for BT.

TBH it ain't really their fault though. As I understand it the issues with how the government funding for unis is being changed. Basically before the changes the uni got something like 12 grand a student, 3 grand paid by the student, 9 by the Government. Now the governments decided it wont subsides the courses nearly as much, so they give the uni say 1 grand a student and say the uni can now charge the students up to 9 to make up the rest of the cash. So now students have to pay 9 grand a year and the uni ends up about 2 grand less a student, so its pretty much lose lose situation for everyone, since students will have to pay more to get less.*

He turned it down so he could make something with a twentieth of a budget that a fifthieth of the people he would see. Now hes being offered big projects and he decides to go work in theater for a fraction of the money.

We never really were good at capitalism but honestly out of all the actors around I'd love to be in his shoes. Forget the money and all that other crap that comes with it, I'd be happy being moderately paid and getting my dream roles.

For me if I ever got the chance to star as the Doctor I'd die happy lol.",0,1301867336,null,0,false,0,c1nnfx2,t3_ggxbg,t1_c1nnfx2,t1_c1nk79u,1427036215,1,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,1

For example when The Hobbit comes out it is fairly to be a big thing and when they originally offered him the role he turned it down because he wanted to work on the next series of Sherlock Holmes.

Even thinking about that is just incredible, he is turning down a small fortune and his face all over a huge franchise to play a sidekick on a plucky little British show.

I've even read that after The Hobbit he plans to retire from Hollywood and focus on Sherlock and then retire from TV and go to theater.

Personally I think hes not doing himself too many favours with the way he thinks. He's also supposed to be extremely picky about what role he takes and has transitioned back to TV even when he was being offered better roles in Hollywood.

I don't think he'll ever be a big Hollywood earner to be honest. After The Hobbit I'm willing to bet you he will get roles and I bet you he won't take them either.

Of course, that would tread on the toes of people who feel privatisation is always the better option.

Something I have never understood is why there is a black and white cut between private sector and public sector. If the private sector can make something run for less and somehow draw a profit from a contracted fee for providing services, the implication to me is that the government could stand to increase revenues through a similar line of thought. 

It's a morally dodgy area, and it's more just a concept, but why don't they make a hybrid public/private sector arm of the government that works like a private company in many regards but startup capital is state funded. Maintenance costs and whatnot would be drawn from profits made by the business, not taxpayers money so they would be self-maintaining to a degree. As such, the state would always have to be the majority shareholder, so all majority-decisions would be by the state as an overruling majority in the instance of the board deciding to take actions percieved to be against the public interest. I suppose it wouldn't really work, it sounds like a perversely inverted nationalisation, but if private businesses are able to profit from offering public services, surely there's a way to keep these services under state control whilst making a profit?

Retconning is always fraught with peril. Look, I'll pretend I'm RTD and wave my hands some more!

&gt; Also, it is worth noting that none of this is what is referred to as ""The Last Great Time War"" as everything that was mentioned about it takes place off screen beginning somewhere during the 8th doctors life

""People assume that time is a strict progression of cause to effect, but actually from a non-linear, non-subjective viewpoint, it's more like a big ball of wibbly-wobbly, timey-wimey... stuff.""

&gt; The Sontarans said they were left out while others were allowed to participate

In hindsight, invading Galifrey (*Invasion of Time* [4]) probably wasn't their best strategic decision ever.

&gt; Dalek Caan entered the Time War after it was locked and arrived in it's first year to save Davros from the jaws of the Nightmare Child

Yeah, forgive me for not taking Caan's description literally. And really, given the number of things popping up from the war, holes in reality, and time being rewritten I think that lock *might* not be completely time-tight.

&gt; Also, the master was not in a time lord body from Keeper of Traken(4) until the end of the Dr. Who movie.

Actually we don't know that he was still in the Keeper's body when the Dr Who movie starts, I fact-checked that one. It's entirely possible he had his new body before the Daleks killed him (which would give him a great incentive to run from them the next chance he got). In fact, I'd say it's probable as the Time Lords would have to extract from the cheetah world of *Survival* (7).

And while it's implied that *Logopolis* (4) immediately follows Keeper from the Master's perspective, he does have a time machine. And it fits rather neatly with Rassilon's actual aims.

Seen from a certain point of view, it ADDS to the richness of the Whoniverse and gives it a bit more cohesion while precisely NOT ruining the mystery of what exactly happened to Eight or wtf the Nightmare Child was or the Could've Been King. He didn't ""encapsulate the Time War from beginning to end with what we've seen."" He used what we've seen as a foundation for what we didn't see in a way that pretty much fits the ""facts"". You really don't think that the TimeLords sending the Doctor on errands to hamper or destroy the Daleks (Planet of the Daleks, Genesis) or the Doctor blowing up Skaro (Rememberance) might be significant to a war chiefly fought between the Daleks and the TimeLords? Or, more pertinent, used by RTD as a basis for what culminated between the TVM qnd Rose?

I'm not a purist on either side and neither are the producers. Doctor Who is one show with 31 soon to be 32 seasons, not a rebooted show (if it was, then Matt would be Three or Four and not Eleven) so it makes sense that events from the classic series had an influence on events during the hiatus and seems painfully obvious to anyone WITHOUT a classic vs NuWho (on either side) bias that the concept of the Time War was based on at least SOME of the events mentioned by OP and I think that is INFINITELY preferable to not having or trying to have a basis even if it involves a bit of retconning. tl;dr The Doctor Who Universe is thankfully very much alive and weaving a new context into old events breathes new life and relevance into some great old stories and robs them of nothing as they are still great stories on their own.

Generally everything seems perfect from the outside, the ideal English village is a facade once the sordid lives of the locals become unearthed.

I actually DO think that a precursor to the Time War was the Doctor being sent back to halt their existence in ""Genesis of the Daleks"".  However when I think of the Time War I imagine a conflict ""with all of creation at stake"".  A constant battle in which Time Lords are being killed, resurrected and killed again.  I see the Daleks chasing the Doctor or the Doctor randomly stumbling across them as simply the exploits OF the Doctor and the Daleks.  

We're not talking about writer's doing research for the new series.  Or basing a conflict like ""the Time War"" on elements of previous encounters.  

The OP's theory is that we've seen the opening shot of the Time War and all it's major conflicts, and speculates all the way up until the regeneration of 8.  This, to me, is an encapsulation of the entire conflict right down to unseen motivations that HE invented.

That's an excellent observation that has some ripple-on effects to stories from the 2 and 3 era.

&gt; Oh, and you forgot ""The Chase"" which would have happened around the same time (from the Daleks' point of view) as Ressurection of the Daleks; both stories have the Daleks building duplicates of the Doctor.

No, *The Chase* is in there, but a bit later since it includes a reverse-engineered TARDIS rather than time corridors. I'm quite sure that they simply re-used an earlier plan to duplicate the Doctor.

&gt; Now add the Big Finish stories, especially Time of the Daleks.

I avoided those because their status as canon is too murky. Eventually I'll have to hunt those down and work it out, but too much work for this exercise.

&gt; Sometime I'll have to tell you my theory that the Time War in the 8th Doctor Novels is the result of the Time Lords removing the Daleks completely from History, and it's the gap in causality itself that's attacking them...

This means that, contention be damned, you get hammered into the ground at 5:30pm on the nose, every day. 

Here's what happened to me:

* Distance from house to exchange: 20 yards (we share a driveway - there should be NO problems)
* Sign up with Sky for PSTN and ADSL
* Get 8Mb/s in the daytime
* Get 0.3Mb/s after 5:30pm
* Literally timed this: sat with speedtest.net at 5:25pm and got 8Mb/s, tried again at 5:35pm and got 0.3Mb/s. Upstream unaffected.
* Discover that Sky have no LLU presence in our exchange ... how are they providing our line then? *On rented BT kit.*

Lots and lots of phone calls. Lots of complaining. In the end I do this:

* Switch the phone line to BT
* Keep ADSL with sky
* Guess what? Now I see 8Mb/s *ALL THE TIME*

Same ISP, but switching the phone line provider from a non-LLU 3rd party to BT. Voilá, everything works better than expected.

Really? But you then say:

&gt; but the downside is that they're first to be traffic-managed to oblivion because BT obviously prefer to prioritise their own phone lines. 

Two statements that almost contradict each other. If any arm of BT is traffic shaping, it'll be BTwholesale, because they own and operate the DSLAM portfolio of BT and the network those DSLAMs are attached to.

No arm of BT does anything to prioritise its own customers over that of other ISPs or phone companies. It'd be very serious if they did, and so far there is zero evidence that they do (apart from your constantly changing allegations).

BTwholesale and Sky shouldn't even know who your phone company is (""operational separation"")- it is none of their business, unless of course you have your phone line through Sky. In my experience there is nothing to suggest that BT (Retail and wholesale) is doing anything dodgy. I've had problems with my ADSL line, and BTwholesale is telling my ISP to get me to call my ""PSTN provider"", which also happens to be BT. But BTwholesale doesn't know this or care.

Your own experience doesn't seem to fit with that of others. Correlation does not imply causation and all that.

Sky's technical support is hardly Andrews and Arnold standard (at least from my experience with TV issues). I wouldn't believe them.

&gt; What would the benefit to them be to limit their own customers in such a way?

Because it's incredibly expensive to provide a service on BT's ADSL network (and incredibly profitable for BT) - the largest cost being the cost of interconnects between the ISP's network and BT. This is why so many ISPs traffic shape, because it reduces the demand on these interconnects and so it means the ISP has to buy less bandwidth.

&gt; That theory was borne out when I switched the phoneline to BT away from Sky and the problem instantly vanished. Use a non-LLU line = slow at peak times, use a BT line = fast at peak times.

But there are several things that could have happened in the interim - you may have been moved to a different DSLAM with no congestion, or there may have been a congestion issue that was fixed. We'll probably never know, even the best ISPs have trouble getting information out of BT. Things ""just fix themselves"" after BT claims there is no fault.

I presume you're aware that Sky **does** traffic shape? http://www.skyuser.co.uk/skyinfo/sky_connect_broadband_traffic_management.html and lots of other Google results suggest that they do, and their Connect (non-LLU) service is to be avoided.

BT Wholesale won't speak to you as you're not their customer, which is Sky. If you have a competent ISP they'll copy and paste what BTwholesale says to them, it makes for interesting reading. It's still incredibly tedious (to the point where my ISP will say ""we'll tell them to do this but don't expect it to make an improvement"").

&gt; Why would the traffic shaping not occur on a BT line but would occur on a Sky line?

Also the terms of service say they only restrict P2P and the like. Browsing shouldn't be affected, but EVERYTHING was slowed to 0.3Mb/s.

I'd still be more inclined to blame Sky - they have the technical means to slow you down. BT (unless you're on BT Retail or Plusnet) would find it much more challenging in a technical sense. Sky, unlike BT, would be able to do so legally. There are mountains of evidence of Sky's traffic shaping, there is none for BTwholesale.

From reading threads on that Sky forum, it seems that **Sky's** traffic shaping affects more than just P2P and borders on making the connection useless.

The only traffic shaping (if you can really call it that) that BT does is to keep Sky's traffic in line with whatever they are paying for.

e.g. They're paying for a 155Mbit connection (between Sky's network and BT), but BT actually provides a 622Mbit connection and polices it to keep the traffic to about 155Mbit. This is completely above-board and standard, the reason being that if Sky wants more bandwidth BT simply has to flick a switch, instead of an expensive and time-consuming process. All ISPs get the same thing - be it shitty ISPs like Sky, or top-shelf ISPs like Andrews and Arnold. I wonder why A&amp;A don't traffic shape or why its customers never experience speed issues?

This has nothing to do with yours or others troubles - certainly nothing to do with time of day or who your phone provider is.

The real issue is that Sky will not pay for enough bandwidth (the ""financial restraints""), and so Sky (not BT) has to implement traffic shaping to try and reduce demand.

* Rivals: I'll try to go into more detail than what's been already posted. Typically, a team's biggest rival will be those who are closest to them geographically. For Chelsea, a south-west London club, this means Fulham and Queens Park Rangers (currently playing in the Championship, a tier below the Premier League) are historically our biggest rivals as they are also based in west London. However, any 'London derby' - a match between two clubs based in London is huge today, so Arsenal and Spurs are considered rivals now. Chelsea-Arsenal is the biggest London derby due to both teams consistently finishing within the top four of the Premier League.

* Manchester United is becoming more of a rival as we are able to challenge them more in recent years. We lost to them in the 2008 Champions League Final on penalties, and we will be playing them in the quarterfinals of the CL this year, starting Wednesday. We've had many run-ins with Liverpool in the Champions League and this has developed a sort of rivalry between us as well. There are some really good matches out there, especially the second leg of the 2009 quarterfinal.

* [Chelsea Megastore USA](http://www.chelseamegastoreusa.com/) although I believe they have a similar selection to that of World Soccer Shop, they seem to use the same database. You can also try the [ESPN Soccernet Store](http://www.soccernetstore.com/) but I doubt it has anything different than the others you've mentioned. Unfortunately, the English version of the Chelsea store has the widest selection and best sales.

* In regards to the hoodie with the logo on it, [this seems to be the only relevant item](http://www.chelseamegastoreusa.com/departments-apparel-jackets-chelsea-soccer-hoodie--royal-.html) but I don't see it in women's. Maybe you can order it in a men's size that would fit you?

* Songs: [This CD](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Blue-Flag-Tribute-Chelsea-FC/dp/B0000086RR) has most of our songs/chants that we use today. Obviously for the newer players we have different ones, although the most frequent chant for a player is the ['Super Frank']() cheer. Our biggest songs are [Blue is the color](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZYfi_Ex_gM), [Blue Flag](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lKqyN4FHcA), [We'll Keep The Blue Flag Flying High](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h3Cr5QqcIbw&amp;feature=related),  [Pride of London](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7g1iTxIk0YE&amp;feature=related), and [Ten men went to mow](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uu7antMYQjc&amp;feature=related). There is also a [Chelsea rap](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3_2tRE5kNM&amp;feature=related).

* Others have said it, but when there's a Chelsea game on you can usually find us on the Reddit IRC chat [here](http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=redditsoccer).

* Traditions? I'm not really sure what else to cover...if you have other questions, ask away.

PS. I see that you're a girl. If I ever see you, or anyone else (guys included) saying that they like Torres because he's 'cute', so help me God I will ban you with a hammer that hits harder than Thor's.

I really have not decided how or if to vote. I don't believe this is a once in a lifetime opportunity, I feel we are being given a false and distracting choice that in effect would [not really change elections](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/8506306.stm). The last election may have made a  [Lib-Lab pact possible but shaky](http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/datablog/2010/may/10/proportional-representation-general-election-2010). And then Clegg said about talks with those that had the most votes/proportion to be examined first. Even in this situation I feel the Orange Bookers would still have marched with the Tories. Miliband may be putting out feelers for the Libs, but the Labour resentment is huge at what is happening. The price would almost certainly be Clegg's head in the remote possibility of cooperation.

I said this is unlikely to be a genuine once in a lifetime opportunity. Why? Because you cannot say what will be the case in the next few years. Having said that, I feel it is more likely there will be no push for reform if AV is selected. It maybe seen as the political settlement, and when 'change' is seen to be nothing of the sort, a desire for proper change may have been lost. Besides, boundary reform will negate any Tory loss.

So, as to the ramifications of the vote politically. Well, I suspect a no win would cause massive coalition trouble. LD's would want more, but I doubt Cameron could offer due to his back-benchers. A yes vote may lead the opposite direction though. I dunno. When I ask myself what is really important, a weak voting change that is not change, or the chance to damage the coalition doing these terrible things, I am really torn.",0,1301931068,null,0,false,0,c1nr707,t3_gi9l9,t1_c1nr707,t1_c1nqkqd,1427038050,5,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,5

The Blues only hope of winning the CL is having Barca lose in the quarters or semi-finals, or some miracle performance against Barca in the championship.

Second, I think having a proven, experienced mid-fielder able to step in under certain circumstances is invaluable. I also think Yossi, when match fit, has a spark that is lacking in our midfield this season (though Ramires is really coming on strong as of late). He always plays hard, and I feel confident when he is on the ball. Although I don't think he will start for this team (barring some unfortunate injury), he adds much needed depth to what has been a lackluster midfield this season. In my opinion, that's all we can hope for this year. As with anything in soccer, we will have to wait and see how he responds to his long lay off and lack of play.

The Doctor is a man who always manages to find a way (well almost always, he fails occasionally) to not have to make the hard choices. He is so clever, so devious, so downright genius, he just always finds a way. 

Jack?, Jack for all his immortality is just a man. He tries(he really does) to live up to The Doctors standard, the incredibly high bar he has set. But when it comes right down to it, hes just a man. He is clever, but not that clever, he is devious, but not quite that devious, and he is in many ways a Genius, but just not genius enough. But to make up for all that? He is willing to do whatever it takes to save humanity, including destroying his own. If it means he has to destroy his own soul to save the world? then he is willing to make that sacrifice.

So what should we do?

#Ban political parties. Vote for a representative, not a party. Have parliament elect the prime minister as a whole and have them form a cabinet.
#Monitor and ban political collusion. Make all communications with the exception of those involving the defence of the realm subject to FoI. Lets have MPs emails online and open to all unless specifically exempt (e.g. direct response to member of the public, national security exemption etc.)
#Monitor and ban lobbying by corporations. With all MP comms transparent, force MPs to have all official business through this channel. Have them declare all interactions with corporations, regardless of whethr money or gifts were involved.
#Make it illegal for MPs to lie in official responses. If an MP is proven to have lied about something, they must resign and upon conviction will pay a fine and not be permitted to stand again as an MP for 5 years. This would be anything involving dodgy dossiers, but not when an MP is reciting information provided by someone else that turns out to be untrue (i.e. the MP repeated the lie but did not originate it) - in this instance the liar is accountable.

Not really. We tried it so many times, with many players occupying the trequartista role and it just never worked. I'm of the opinion it leaves us too narrow and in order to compensate (throw the fullbacks forward), it leaves us too exposed at the back, even with Essien covering. Yossi may be the best player suited for the tip of the diamond, but I don't think the team is suited for the formation. It also restricts Lampard quite a bit I'd say, he wouldn't be able to play as CAM so much as CM/LM, which is bad for us overall.

I think with Lampard getting back into form we should revert to the 4-3-3. His defensive ability is underrated, and Ramires is looking much better in Blue nowadays that I think we'd see a much different team than the one we saw earlier this year. Playing 4-4-2 isn't really ideal because we don't have a natural right winger, although Ramires is not bad at it, and PES tells me Kalou is actually pretty good there. We do have three good CM/CAM so we may as well use all of them in the 4-3-3.",0,1301957698,null,0,false,0,c1ntmfg,t3_gid3y,t1_c1ntmfg,t1_c1nspcn,1427039194,1,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,1

true,sailfastliveslow,present,null,"Honestly, Lampard is best suited as a deep lying midfielder, not as a CAM. his specialty is starting the buildup and ending it.  he drops back to take the ball from the defense, playing on the left side of the midfield, and linking up with terry and cole to start our possesion. once he helps move the ball forward, he specializes in arriving in the box late, from deep.  this makes it VERY hard to mark him since basically it's like another forward coming out of nowhere (based on his finishing).  that's why he scores so many goals for a midfielder and that is what makes him special, his late runs. when you put him in an already advanced position, he is much easier to mark out of a game (as everyone saw when we tried to play him as the tequarista).

thus, the only problems with the diamond (in lampard's aspect) are that it might make him slide wide a little more than usual (to compensate for the lack of width in the midfield), and he might have a little less space for those late runs (with 3 in the box instead of two).

the player it limits the most, however, is essien.  by sticking him in front of the defense, and letting the full backs go forward to give width, he would have to be very disciplined in staying back to help the cb's.  that makes it harder for him to boss the midfield with his high energy runs.

the diamond is also very good at maintaining possession, and might help us with our supply to the strikers, our main problem at the moment.  honestly, i would not be too surprised to see us play a diamond/flat hybrid once yossi is back in the team.",0,1301962441,null,0,false,0,c1ntzfj,t3_gid3y,t1_c1ntzfj,t1_c1ntmfg,1427039363,1,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,1

This is because we didn't win any major trophies besides the FA Cup before we were bought in 2003 by Roman Abramovich, who funded a lot of big money transfers. Afterwards, we won the league a few times, FA Cup plenty of more, and have progressed deep into the Champions League. So many of our rivals jeer us by saying we've bought our trophies and we're a team of mercenaries, call us Chelski, etc.

The phrase, I believe, originated from Liverpool FC:

&gt; F*ck Off Chelsea FC,
You ain't got no history,
Five European Cup's and 18 leagues,
That's what we call history...

Which is to say, Liverpool are extremely upset we were able to win the EPL three times while the last time 'Pool won the top division of English football was the 1989/1990 season (was the Football League First Division back then, not the English Premier League).

As for an American sports equivalent, pre-lockout/salary cap New York Rangers would be a good fit except we can actually win and play well, or the LA Lakers.

true,ScreamingGerman,null,null,"I don't like playing Lamps as deep lying, he's perfect for the absolute centre of the pitch (on the left side of course) and playing end to end, because you're right in that he's good at dropping back and making a tackle here and there, being part of the build-up with Cole and Terry, but he can also continue on and work with Cole, Malouda, and even a striker dropping back to further move the ball up and get a cross into the box. The late runs in are good but if he's sitting deep he's restricted to only making those late runs, which defenders will be more aware of. If he has free roam to both ends of the pitch, he has the choice to make a late run, or continue to be involved in the build-up. He plays in a role that affords him a lot of freedom and that's maybe what makes him so dangerous.

You do see him move into the centre or left side of the midfield but if he were in a diamond I think he'd be expected to move over and put the crosses in from the left wing, which isn't natural for him. He's a CM with a tendency to play LM a bit, but a diamond would ask for him to play wide as well, which is outside of his comfort.

When talking about playing the diamond, I actually heard Ramires would play as the base because he offers good tackling ability and his range of passes are pretty good. Truth is though, Ramires and Essien are both all-action midfielders and neither should be shackled down as a defensive midfielder or even holding midfielder. I think only Mikel suits that role now as he has a lot of experience playing there and although he started out as an attacking midfielder, he's made that position his own more and more.

Chelsea have been a team that are generally good at keeping possession the past few years and our most typical formation has been a 4-5-1 under Mourinho or the 4-3-3 under Hiddink/Carlo. I think the strikers themselves are suffering from a being too uncreative and lacking chemistry with each other right now. The supply has been pretty well but they aren't making the most of the chances, which is maybe where Yossi can help, by adding some more creativity into the attack to make space for the strikers. I still don't think he's the kind of player that warrants a change of formation to the team  - we just changed after Torres came in, which way another bad move I think.

I live in a constituency that, because of the way people tend to vote for who their parents tell them to vote for and some historic events, will not be anything but a stronghold for one of the major parties for a long time to come. Anybody that doesn't agree with that parties policies here (about 30-40% judging by the last election) will still have a wasted vote, and no representative for their views.


I honestly can't see it fixing tactical voting or the outcome in my constituency because people will still put down the stronghold party for fear of the opposition getting in, and maybe put down another party as second, which will still produce the same result. Which depresses me no end.


My big worry is that if this does pass then we're left with a system that's still not representative of the wishes of a large portion of the population, and if someone then tries to suggest another voting reform the parties are just going to turn around and say ""What're you talking about we just had one?

Something else struck me: from his appearence in Stolen Earth, it's possible that Dalek Caan saved Davros after Revelation, but *before* Rememberence; causing a weird gap in causality. Which would explain the whole Emporer Dalek vs Davros internal conflict that happens in Rememberence (and later audios).


Here's a couple of links that might help:
[Dalek History 1](http://www.bbc.co.uk/doctorwho/classic/episodeguide/dalekhistory1.shtml)

[And 2](http://www.bbc.co.uk/doctorwho/classic/episodeguide/dalekhistory2.shtml)


It's from the BBC website adaption of the discontinuity guide, I forget who wrote it, probably Gary Russell. 


It used to be so much easier when BBC7 was in RealPlayer, you could listen to it anywhere. Although there one announcer who used to tell international listeners that they were freeloading. 


As to which ones are cannon, it's Dr Who! Everything is loosly considered cannon unless it contradicts something established; if that happens, both are definitely cannon and Gary Russell has to write a story to fix it.

Part of it was the expressiveness of Tennant's face and physical mannerisms, it made it very jarring when one second he would be crying about how lonely he was and the next he'd be all dark and ""out of mercy"".

 As I view it the 9th Doctor was depressed over what he had seen and done during the Time War since he either fought for some of it, or was ""born"" out of its final moments. The 10th was secretly self loathing and angry about everything he had lost, always trying to deflect with a big smile and a wacky adventure, and so far it seems the 11th is far enough away from it that the sadness isn't a constant burden on him the way it was for 9 &amp; 10.",0,1301984687,null,0,false,0,c1nvmy2,t3_gisbj,t1_c1nvmy2,t1_c1nuu1n,1427040149,11,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,11

The more I go back to Tennants run the more I see his manic personality as a cover, a mask, the type of man he desperately wants to be. Like he said in Time Crash he wanted to go back to being care free and fun loving, without the burden of the Time War and all the related issues weighing him down. And his unresolved issue with the Time War was NOT just him not getting over what HE did, but rather what The Time Lords had become. They had become mad with power after eons of being non-interventionist observers. He had seen just how powerful and awful his people could be. I think this is part of the reason why after getting over the initial trauma of the war 10 seemed so human. He was in denial over his own nature. He had seen what the time lords did, and what he did to stop them, and he didn't like the idea that really he was no different. Time Lord Victorious was a case of him embracing it too much and almost going too far. 10 ALWAYS had that dark streak. He may have hated what Harriet Jones did, but had the Sycorax not left so easily he probably would have done something which would have achieved the same results. 

By comparison 11 never seems to hang so much on his being sorry. He apologizes, sure, but he always moves forward and never looks back. If he couldn't save someone then he just couldn't. If he saves the day, great. He knows and accepts the bad things he may have to do sometimes and the good he just can't do. 10 could never quite accept that imho.

true,leondz,eu,Britain,"I'm pro-power, and anti-weapons, but I don't like the tone of this article in places. The CNd has done some good things, including pushing for raised nuclear safety standards - and given that we have had INES 3 incidents in the UK as recently as 2005, that's still a campaign worth fighting for.

It seems preposterous, given the bodies and qualities of evidence over the Chernobyl disaster, to assume that there was not wider spread ill health than the figures verified by the UN and IAEA. They are doing their jobs well, and proving a link is likely as difficult in this case as it always is in science; what they have done is provided a million. I utterly refute the figure of 1 000 000 cancers as a result, and it's extrapolation of course - but in the absence of evidence, extrapolation is better than nothing.

For example, of the 500 000 - 1 500 000 [liquidators](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquidator_\(Chernobyl\)), how would we determine the later effects on health? There are the following obstacles:

- one must be were looking at the health of the workers and have identified them;
- the workers must have people sought care
- the workers needed to be tracked over multiple nations and over the breakup of the USSR
- the diagnoses (of leukaemia or similar) need to be correct
- records need to be kept well (it'll have all been paper)
- linked diseases need to be honestly reported and associated, ignoring government desires

These factors culminate to make it incredibly hard to make any judgement on the lethality of the incident, and George recognises that, and uses it to decry the higher figures. That's fine, I suppose, but it in no way supports any idea that the the IAEA figures are the totality of the damage.

Further, when discussing the resident populace's sufferings, one must remember that again the above factors (making tracking almost impossible) and then also that there is an exclusion zone in force. I doubt that even if the populace had all remained in place, permitting a comparison on geographic factors, that the base rates of leukaemia and other cancer would have been accurately recorded - or recorded at all.

Illnesses caused by radioactive exposure are not well investigated, and the long-term effects largely imprecise, because data is sparse. This is in a way a good thing, suggesting that few people have been exposed. It's definitely dangerous, and having groups like the CND pushing in the direction of removing plants will help make them safer when they (hopefully) appear. Given the Windscale disaster and sloppiness involved in the construction and management of Sellafield, one can certainly sympathise with any campaign to remove nuclear installations conducted as they were in the 20th century.

So, while George makes a point that the highest figures are questionable (when aren't they?), having both upper and lower bounds is a fantastic help in risk assessment, and as long as one can critically assess the value of each piece of data, as always, there is no need to flail one's arms in the air and denounce the CND as a fraud.

He is right to discredit extrapolation posing as evidence, but he is not right to discredit the practice of extrapolation or to suggest that we should only rely on the proven cases.

absolutely. They have specific intake dates.

The only reason more money hasn't been put into this sooner is because you can't make weapons with the by-products. 

&gt; India's Kakrapar-1 reactor is the world's first reactor which uses thorium rather than depleted uranium to achieve power flattening across the reactor core.[38] India, which has about 25% of the world's thorium reserves, is developing a 300 MW prototype of a thorium-based Advanced Heavy Water Reactor (AHWR). The prototype is expected to be fully operational by 2011, following which five more reactors will be constructed.[39] Considered to be a global leader in thorium-based fuel, India's new thorium reactor is a fast-breeder reactor and uses a plutonium core rather than an accelerator to produce neutrons. As accelerator-based systems can operate at sub-criticality they could be developed too, but that would require more research.[40] India currently envisages meeting 30% of its electricity demand through thorium-based reactors by 2050.[41]

&gt; In 2007, Norway was debating whether or not to focus on thorium plants because of the large deposits of thorium ores in the country, particularly at Fensfeltet near Ulefoss in Telemark county.

&gt; The primary fuel of the HT3R Project near Odessa, Texas, USA will be ceramic-coated thorium beads.[42]

&gt; However, the best results occur with molten-salt reactors (MSRs), such as ORNL's LFTR, which have built-in negative-feedback reaction rates, due to salt expansion and thus reactor throttling via load. This is a great safety advantage, since no emergency cooling system is needed, which is both expensive and adds thermal inefficiency. In fact, an MSR was chosen as the base design for the 1960s DoD Atomic Plane largely because of its great safety advantages, even under aircraft maneuvering. In the basic design, an MSR generates heat at higher temperatures, continuously, and without refuelling shutdowns, so it can provide hot air to a more efficient (Brayton Cycle) turbine. An MSR run this way is about 30% better in thermal efficiency than common thermal plants, whether combustive or traditional solid-fuelled nuclear.[43]

&gt; In 2010, Congressman Joe Sestak added funding for research and development of a destroyer-sized reactor using thorium.[44]

&gt; Atomic Energy Canada Limited's Candu reactors are capable of using thorium as a fuel source.[45]

&gt; At the 2011 annual conference of the Chinese Academy of Sciences it was announced that ""China has initiated a research and development project in thorium molten-salt reactor technology.""[46]

Re. your wiki link: you're making the usual ignorant mistake of confusing a uranium reactor that uses thorium as *part* of the fuel cycle with a gen. IV LFTR. Did you even read what you quoted? It explains it for you.

&gt; The prototype is expected...

Oh yeah, *prototypes* are always expected to solve everything. You need to grasp that *prototypes* are not the same as economically and technically feasible commercial power stations. Here's some more that separates techno-fantasy from reality:

* Any forecast of the development of nuclear power in the next 25 years has to concentrate on two aspects, the supply of uranium and the addition of new reactor capacity. At least within this time horizon, neither nuclear breeding reactors **nor thorium reactors will play a significant role because of the long lead times for their development and market penetration**. This assessment results in the conclusion that in the short term, until about 2015, the long lead times of new and the decommissioning of ageing reactors perform the barrier for fast extension, and after about 2020 severe uranium supply shortages become likely which, again will limit the extension of nuclear energy. http://www.theoildrum.com/node/2379

Even after 2-0 down, we still had a shot to do SOME damage control especially since we could have netted a precious away goal.

What really pissed me off, was that the team looked like they just gave up after the 2nd goal. No effort, and they just looked lethargic to do anything.

Here's something else that's pissing me off. Not necessarily on this site, but on Facebook and other sites, Spurs supporters are throwing in the towel. I would think after what happened at the San Siro during the group stages, we would be the LAST team to throw in the towel when the situation is looking grim.

Is it a difficult situation to come back from? No doubt, but I REFUSE to say Spurs are out of the Champions League, until the final whistle of the next leg goes, and the aggregate score goes in favor of Real Madrid over us.

Anyone who says Crouch has got to go, I would like to remind you all that Peter Crouch's goal against AC Milan is the reason why we're here. Yeah AC Milan may not have had their ""A"" line-up against us, but the aggregate counter said Peter Crouch's goal was enough to see us through to the quarter-finals. If any changes need to be made to our team, I'd say either invest in better defense or a new goalkeeper (but that's a convo for another day)

Either way, you should for sure watch the stuff from 2005 onward at some point.  It's for the most part on Netflix instant watch if that helps.

I ask to be passed though to third line technical support whenever I ring them. I don't have time for people telling me that there are no profiles on my LLU line when I know for a fact that there are. 

The problem I had (I will preface by saying I am a technical support engineer who deals with over 100 ADSL broadband lines at seperate sites/exchange) was that I was getting a line attenuation of 64.5dB and absolutely terrible connection speeds (Sub 1mb). Everyone else on the street has attenuations in the thirties. I am a few Km (cable length) from the exchange but my argument was that the attenuation should not be almost double at only my house. When I finally got them to call BT Openreach the engineer came out and tested the line and because it met certain parameters refused to do anything. I asked them to put me on a different E-side cable from the green cab but he refused based on the fact that by doing that it would be admitting a problem when there isn't one as the line falls under the parameters that BT deem acceptable for a line.

Subsequently I am left with crappy connection speeds. I can't even stream youtube videos properly. 

As far as I am aware it would be against Ofcom rules for BT to throttle none BT traffic and I think ohreilly is right and what you experiences was Sky running out of available bandwidth to the BT network.

The state of the internet in this country is shocking on the ADSL network. The quicker they get FTTC in the better, even better would be FTTH but that is not going to happen anytime soon.

The Doctor is over 900 years old.  He's a Time Lord, which is a pretentious term for Science Alien.  When Time Lords are mortally wounded, they regenerate into a new form, with a different personality.  (This is how the show explains different actors playing the same character.)  

He's also the *last* of the Time Lords, as all of the others were killed in a big war with the Daleks.  (Daleks are mean R2D2 aliens, and all of the Daleks died in the war too, except that they didn't because they keep showing up.)

The Doctor has a time machine called the TARDIS, which he stole when he was a kid.  It's also a little bit alive.  He zooms about time and space in the TARDIS picking up random people, hanging out with them for a while, then kicking them out.  He's been doing this for centuries.

It's called 'baseload'. You're exposing your ignorance at every step. Get a clue:

* The Combined Power Plant. How Germany will provide 100% renewable electricity by 2050. http://www.kombikraftwerk.de/index.php?id=27

* ""...base-load electricity demand can be met by biomass, hot rock geothermal, solar thermal electricity with storage, and wind power with storage. ...there is no technical reason to stop renewable energy from supplying 100 per cent of grid electricity."" http://www.aph.gov.au/library/pubs/rp/2008-09/09rp09.htm

* The Base Load Fallacy. http://www.energyscience.org.au/BP16%20BaseLoad.pdf

* Contrary to common knowledge, an average of 33% and a maximum of 47% of yearly averaged wind power from interconnected farms can be used as reliable, baseload electric power. Equally significant, interconnecting multiple wind farms to a common point, and then connecting that point to a far-away city can allow the long-distance portion of transmission capacity to be reduced, for example, by 20% with only a 1.6% loss of energy. http://www.stanford.edu/group/efmh/winds/aj07_jamc.pdf

&gt; ...both of which we need.

You are wise in the ways of anti-renewable FUD.

true,JB_UK,null,null,"The key bit, imo:

Questioned by the assistant deputy coroner, Judge Peter Thornton QC, Harwood has accepted that the account of events he put in his notebook two weeks after the protests was incorrect.

These relate to Harwood's explanation of the aftermath of his attempt to arrest a protester for daubing graffiti, when he said he came under attack from hundreds of protesters and was in fear for his life. Video cast doubt over that, and Thornton specifically went through the list.

    Harwood: At the time I wrote this, I thought I fell to the floor.
    Thornton: Do you now accept that this is not correct?
    Harwood: Yes
    Thornton: That you lost your baton – that is not correct?
    Harwood: Yes
    Thornton: That you received a blow to the head – that is not correct?
    Harwood: Yes
    Thornton: And that there were violent and dangerous confrontations – that is not correct?
    Harwood: Yes.
    Thornton: And you were struck by a missile – that is not correct?
    Harwood: Yes.

Thornton then asked how Harwood got all this wrong when he wrote the statement on 16 April, more than two weeks after the protests.

Harwood said: ""Because at the time that is what I believed happened, from the information I had, that is what I believed happened to me there.""",0,1302044092,null,0,false,0,c1nz3sg,t3_gj26u,t1_c1nz3sg,t3_gj26u,1427041849,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

When the RTD series was in development and Enterprise was still on telly, there was talk of a cross-over between the two series- there's a TARDIS in one episode of Enterprise. They both have Time Wars, maybe it's the same Time War. One of the things that was happening in the novels at the time was that some of the Time Lords were becoming the ""Celestis"", which were basically the Q Continuum. I sometimes wonder if this was also part of the aborted Trek/Who crossover. 


Anyhoo, it would certainly tie in with Guinan's reaction to Q for her to be a Time Lord who didn't ""Ascend"" and join the continuum.

On your actual question:  Did you like Blink, Girl in the Fireplace, The Empty Child/The Doctor Dances and Silence in the Library/Forest of the Dead?

A lot of people have seemed to have had trouble letting go of Tennant's Doctor, which is fair, but what I've heard from a lot of people is that while at first they resented the 11th Doctor, by the end of the series they liked him quite a lot, and on re-watching his episodes, they adored him.  Personally, as much as I love David Tennant as an actor and would probably do dirty things to him given half a chance, I love Matt Smith's Doctor best.

I am huge fan of offensive comedy but can't stand Frankie Boyle. He always poses as dangerous comedian who shocks but the only truly shocking part of his act is his lack of talent. A real master of this art would be able to take soft target like Jordan/Katie Price apart without heaping abuse upon her disabled son. In fact, a third rate comedian should be able to knock her down a peg or two. His apologists may whinge that it is out of context but I saw the whole show and the context was stream of schoolboy jokes where he delights himself by mention rape or paedophilia yet adds almost no surrounding material. I understand that he's playing character and is probably a lovely bloke but there's far more to offensive comedy than constantly grasping for headlines in the tabloids. The OFCOM censure is almost irrelevant, his show has been condemned by viewers who deserted in droves despite his desperate attempts for cheap publicity. The best censorship device is the OFF button, 500 people complained but 725, 000 stopped viewing, which was over half the initial viewing figures. Although, I'm sure when it is ditched we'll hear the tired cries of censorship from his remaining fan base.

true,bigbadbass,flair5,Klinsmann #18,"Crouch is a dick, and that 2nd tackle was completely unnecessary. And along with Lennon dropping out, that was game over.

Our game plan was to release the wingers as often as we could, and thump the ball up to Crouch and hope we can get support to him quick enough. 

Once Lennon &amp; Crouch were gone, we only had an off form Bale as an outlet. Which led to us defending our penalty area while Real just passed it around us and took their sweet ass time.

Pisses me off, but it was bad luck all round. If Lennon had played, and Crouch hadn't got sent off then I could have seen us doing what we did to AC away, defending bravely and maybe nick a goal at the end.

But, alas, we shot ourselves in the foot again. Made it difficult for ourselves, again. Just like we're doing in the league. Again.

I fear Real are just too good to lose 4-0 in 90 minutes. And unless Bale turns up I really can't see our strikers managing that many goals in one game. 

This coupled with our league form and a throat infection has depressed me greatly. We have Stoke at home on Saturday in what is now a must win game. The stakes are so high, I really can't see all of VdV, Bale, Modric and Sandro staying if we don't get CL next season.
