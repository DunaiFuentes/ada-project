He doesn't seem particularly adept at helping his team get the ball back unless it is right in front of him and he gives the ball away a lot like Gerrard did this season.  Another reason I don't think he should be brought in is that a more defensive midfielder should be brought in to replace Mascherano/Poulson.  What would Mr. Dalglish have done if Lucas had gotten injured this past season?  If Adam is brought in though I would expect a central midfielder, in addition to Poulson, to be sold or loaned out.

The Abrams Star Trek movie came out, and I really enjoyed it, so I threw myself into Star Trek and western (i.e. American) science fiction/genre shows. I spent my summer vacation watching reruns of shows on Sci-Fi/Syfy, and one day I saw Doctor Who. I'd vaguely heard of the show, in that I knew there was a big fandom and it was a classic, like Star trek, so I figured, hey, may as well watch. 

My first episodes were Sontarem Strategem/Poison Sky and School Reunion.  I also remember seeing The Master return, although I had no idea who he was or what the fobwatch did. I think I also caught the first season of the Sarah Jane Adventures. When I got back to my dorm for classes a friend and I sat down and marathoned Doctor Who and Torchwood.

I can open ExpatShield and in about twenty seconds it's ready to go.

It's ad-based, but I don't find it to be a problem, really. Some websites get a big banner ad at the top. It happens on reddit, for example, but not facebook or Yahoo! Mail.

Good thing I was so bored so I decided to watch on, and I managed to get to *Dalek* and *The Empty Child/The Doctor Dances*. Now I was enjoying it. Unfortunately, her DVD of *Bad Wolf* was skipping horrendously, so I didn't even get to Tennant.

Returned the DVDs to her, and forgot about DW for a few years until I heard that Tennant was about to regenerate. I figured that a new Doctor would be a great jumping-on point, so I downloaded *The Eleventh Hour*. Before I knew it, I found myself becoming a huge DW fan.

true,[deleted],null,null,"Ok, so first this wont work because the whole point of a retail bank is to collect together both debt and capital and to finance/invest it through bigger ""investment"" banks.  So if all the investment banks flop on the same massive, system wide scale as before then the retail banks will still fail whether they are the same company as before or not.

This sort of separation only protects single retail banks from the failure of single investment banks they are owned by.  That was not the problem here.

Second, retail banking in its current form (free accounts with free withdrawals and other services like BACs transfer) is not viable.  The retail arms of banks are all loss making, they only keep them because the UK government provides favourable tax and regulation but asks them to do some social stuff like have branches.

This is why banks are so desperate to sell us all ""privilege"" accounts.  Look at the EU, US or other western nations, hardly anyone gets current accounts for free.  I would like to keep that but that's not possible if investment banks are really required to actually separate themselves from high-street ones.

Whats interesting is the differences in reactions between the clerics in the Crash of the Byzantium and in AGMGTW, in CotB they love him, so something has to happen to completely change their views on him.
I've suspected that they would keep slowly building Omega up to be the bad guy in 2013, and they would do either a special or multi-episode arc where they bring the past Doctors back to stop Omega. To support this, you have (basically) all of the other anniversary specials bringing back other doctors, AND the inclusion of Omega in one of them. Also with today's news that Series 7 is going to be split up between 2012 &amp; 2013, it means they won't have to drag the foreshadowing out another season.

About the Silence and Clerics, they're either working together, or they're against each other. In DOTM the Silence are practically raising Spacesuit girl (who I'm assuming is River... But it might not be), so either they've stolen her from the clerics, or are under the control of the Clerics to help raise her. I've also kind of thought that maybe the Silence are the Clerics' attempts at creating a Timelord from Rivers' DNA, to make a suitable host for Omega to arrive in.

I agreed to ""DJ"" a for-the-moment nameless top orthopedic surgeon's party, which consisted mainly of Hooray Henrys blathering on about Chablis and ethnic minorities in a tent whilst I tended my PA, to which I'd attached my ipod. He'd told me a pretty general list of crap songs to be played earlier in the week, but that I was free to deviate if the mood felt right.

Fast-forward to about 1am and the hooray henrys had mostly vacated the floor in order to drinkdrive their ways home and there were a bunch of teenagers asking me to play some more modern music instead of the twee british prog-folk i'd been torturing the crowd with all night. So I put on Rhianna's Umbrella, not a great song, but it's a party....and lo and behold people start dancing and enjoying themselves. Not 2 verses into the song, the music comes to an abrupt halt, and I turn around to see Mr Top Orthopedic Surgeon ripping out my ipod and chucking it half way across the marquee whilst shouting something about black music.

tl;dr: Even if they say deviate from the list at will, don't.

edit: I'll always remember this party for the stunning 19 year old girl coming up to me and asking for a cigarette. I didn't smoke, so I pointed her in the direction of an aquaintance who I sometimes drink with. The aquaintance is circa 70 years old, but could probably pass for 60. Anyway, I go for a pee and on my way, there is 70 year old aquaintance getting a handjob under the table in the main marquee for that cigarette.

true,djnrrd,davison,Davison,"Some interesting theories, but consider the following:

**Clerics and Monks**

Moff stated in Confidential that he believed in the future armies would be sponsored by the Churches (plural).

The ""thin/fat gay"" couple stated that they were Aglican clerics and the dispensation of the ""No peeking under the hoods"" rule was granted by the Papal Mainframe. This suggests to me that we have representatives from Protestant and Catholic denominations. Also note that The Fat One goes for Conversion Counselling.

During the Colonel's speech to the army he describes The Doctor as not being a goblin or trickster but a man, but given that these terms have been used for him it could be surmised that both religious factions believe The Doctor to be evil, and have perpetuated these myths outside of the armies. This belief may have been manipulated by an outside force.

**Headless Monks &amp; Omega**

This is a cool idea, but Moff also stated that he came up with the Headless Monks after a throwaway line in The Time of Angels. It could be that The Moff lies about this, or it could be a happy accident during the creation process. Either way I wouldn't put too much weight behind that part of the theory.

(Edit - More thoughts)

**The Silence, Their Ships and Their Role**

After Series 5's ""Silence will fall"" key phrase we finally get to see The Silence and so far they appear only to have been a Monster of the Week and the Amy/Madame Kovarian mystery has taken up most of this half of the series. The following points are bugging me and I can't work them out yet.

* The Silence's lair was shown to be the same design as the ship upstairs in The Lodger. 
* The ship in The Lodger used a perception filter to trick people's memories much like The Silence themselves.
* The ""Mystery Stairs"" in Amy's house is reminiscent of the ship in The Lodger
* The Silence stated that Amy will ""...bring The Silence""
* Trailers have shown that Craig from The Lodger will be reappearing this series.

I've stated in another thread on here that there's no evidence for The Silence after 1969, and the empty ship in The Lodger could mean that they are eradicated by 2010.

true,sionnach,irish,Filthy foreigner,"Actually, not really - what it may mean is that retail banks bleed slowly dry, without much ability to recapitalise. You also have to take into account that it's not really possible to separate retail and what people might call investment banking. Mortgages, for example, just cannot be funded by deposits - they are packaged and sold on the capital markets. It's harder (but not impossible) to do this at the moment, which is one of the contributing reasons for mortgage credit drying up. For a retail bank to operate with any scale and efficiency (and therefore lower costs to consumers with competition) they must be active players on the capital markets - they need to issue and consume products traded there.

I'm not saying ring-fencing it's a bad thing, but it is not a silver bullet by any stretch. All that is being done is shuffling risk around - and every time this is done there are plenty of unintended consequences. You can certainly expect to pay higher fees for retail banking services in the future. It's not necessarily a win for consumers at all.

For what it's worth, I think the good use of CoCos will be the most stabilising feature of banking over the next number of years.

**Socrates, 4th Century BCE:**
The children now love luxury; they show disrespect for elders and love chatter in places of exercise. Children are tyrants, not the servants of their households. They no longer rise when their elders enter the room. They contradict their parents, chatter before company, gobble up dainties [food] at the table, cross their legs and tyrannise their teachers

**Plato, 4th Century BCE:**
What is happening to our young people? They disrespect their elders, they disobey their parents. They ignore the law. They riot in the streets inflamed with wild notions. Their morals are decaying. What is to become of them?

**Seneca, 1st Century CE:**
Our young men have grown slothful. There is not a single honourable occupation for which they will toil night and day. They sing and dance and grow effeminate and curl their hair and learn womanish tricks of speech; They are as languid as women and deck themselves out with unbecoming ornaments. Without strength, without energy, they add nothing during life to the gifts with which they were born - then they complain of their lot

As for the measure of inflation, its from the Office for Budget Responsibility a wing of the treasury so it is pretty much George Osbournes own personal approved measure.

The thing about inflation is that ""a rising tide lifts all boats"" as they say.  So tax income will rise by 5% (or double in little more than 10 years as you rightly say).  So will the cost of treating people.

So, in conclusion, given the increase in both Government revenue and costs, if the NHS budget does not rise in line then we will have to treat half as many people as we do now within 10 years, but that is not a real problem since revenue is rising just as quickly.

So all we need to do is forget about this silly 20bn in ""efficiency savings"" and link the NHS budget to inflation (seems only fair).

Without saying anything further he proceeded, with a great amount of force, to smack the guy with the phone directly in the face - Knock out. The bus immediately stops as the driver informed them that fighting is not tolerated and the police would be called unless they all got off. Blood cascaded from the unconscious guy's nose while the other two were literally stunned into silence - The man said: ""I suggest you boys fuck off then"". They picked up their friend and took him down stairs - All the usual cowardly threats and swearing started up again as they retreated. Unfortunately they had left the phone on the floor in their haste, so the man picked it up and dropped it out the window to them - No doubt it shattered on the pavement as the bus drove away.

It is unfortunate that everyone else in the vicinity may not share the need to hear what you are listening to, just as older generations think it's rude and anti-social to be afflicted with some kids shitty speed garage, so those kids now think its rude and anti-social to sit with headphones on and ignore everyones converstions.

I had a similar experience on the 33 going to Hammersmith, a bunch of rowdy school kids were playing R&amp;B and throwing things at the back of this old blokes head ( he was about 80 )  he lost it, went to their seat and started screaming at them about manners and being quiet pointing his finger. They just laughed in his face and threw back a load of profanities, so the old guy ( completely red in the face by now ) sits back down visibly shaking. Two of the kids however follow him back and sit in the seat behind tapping him on the head with a rolled up newspaper. The poor bloke loses it again and goes for the throat of one of the kids. The kid slaps him out of the way and starts going mad at the old bloke ""Who the fuck do you think you are grandad, you can't touch me like that innit, I'll fuckin av you"" etc. etc. You know, in that kinda broken English/Jamaican/America slang the ""yout"" seem to have assimilated in London. 

I'm watching all of this from the back of the bus remaining absolutely silent. 

The old guy, clearly traumatised, rings the bell to get off at the next stop, the bus stops, he gets off. The two kids follow him  (I'm following too by this point because I'm fucked if they're beating up a defenceless old man. No chance. ) One of the kids is shoving him and poking him in the back saying stuff like "" When you get around this corner bruv am gonna fuck you up innit"" 

Enough.  I slapped one of the kids around the back of the head as hard as I could. He hit the deck sideways. Didn't even see it coming ( so much for street smarts eh ) 

This kid's on the floor with his hands covering his face saying stuff like  ""What you doin bruv, what you doin, bruv, bruv, there's no need for that, bruv, bruv,  leave it out, bruv, bruv. "" he's almost crying. 

You can imaging the rest of the dialogue. Needless to say after a few choice words the kid gets up and runs off. His mate had already flown. 

I escorted a very thankful, very shaken old bloke back onto the next 33 home.

Honestly, an old man...  fucking cowards.

Extradition treaties vary from country to country, and our treaties with the US are very generous to them, favouring US interests over those of our own citizens, this is likely the issue in this case (though I'm not certain of the detail since these laws came into effect after I left the UK).

A person listening to music on their phone speaker is not doing it because they want to listen to the music. It's about dominance of the situation. They want to show others around them that they're in charge. They're doing something that they know is rude and that they know will piss you off, but they also know they're not doing anything illegal.

There is nothing you can do to make them stop it, since they're officially not doing anything wrong. They're just being obnoxious for its own sake, and I'm certain the one thing they don't want is for nobody to pay them any attention.

Because that's what this is all about. Give me attention, they're saying. Challenge me. I'm deliberately pushing buttons to wind you up, and I want you to be upset.

You can ask them politely to turn their music down, but that just gives them what they want. Also, the kind of person who deliberately pisses off those around them isn't really going to respond kindly to politeness and manners.

I actually started a Tumblr blog a few months ago dealing with this very subject: http://shitmusicshitphone.tumblr.com/ (In case you can't tell, I lost interest after a couple of days).

I find that just openly laughing at them and taking their photo puts them on the back foot. I've actually had this conversation:

""What are you doing?""  
""Taking your picture""  
""What for?""  
""Website"" (photo is already uploading at this point)

By this point others on the bus not in their age range were taking notice, maybe laughing, but mostly the person with the music realises they've lost their standing and either get off or just shut off the music.

Google doesn't host illegal torrents, actually.  Yes, there is a difference between hosting the pirated content and hosting the torrent which points to the pirated content, but so too is there a difference from hosting a torrent and linking to sites which host torrents.

It is unquestionable that there is legal value in indexing and searching sites which host torrents (the MPAA itself uses Google to find pirate sites).  It's a little harder to explain why you were hosting the torrent itself.

Also, Google has an easily-demonstrated defense that they index the whole internet, not ""just"" pirated material.  When someone is running a torrent site which *only* (or predominantly) points to pirated material, that defense is considerably weakened.

You bring up some interesting points. I have thought about two possibilities and a ramification to tie up the Pandorica:

1.) The aliens we know as the Silence, and The Church are both working toward the same ends, what we would call ""The Silence"" and Kovarian knows that they are crucial to each other, but the rest of The Church aren't privy to this knowledge. Amy ""bringing the Silence"" is, in essence, bringing River who will bring Omega. These are also common motifs used in most religion and myth, which any good writer, Moffat included rely heavily on.

or

2.) The Silence are NOT the creation of Omega, and both the Silence and The Church are vying for the honor of bringing Omega victory. I don't think this is a likely scenario, however.

On the Matter of the Pandorica, I think these races saw that there was a crack in time that had to be created by a TARDIS, as the Daleks and Sontarans said, and the Dalek says **""Only the Doctor can fly the TARDIS.""** I think this line is a crucial hint that there is another Time Lord that can create such a tear in time and space, and it could be that it's River, but I think that overall this event belons to Omega.

As far as Amy's staircase goes, this could be a red herring, but there is far too much emphasis on the big empty house to be a coincidence, so I think you have something.

Also, on a side note about the the trickster goblin quotes. Did you notice that, when the lights are off, The Doctor says ""I'm not a **phantom**. I'm not a **trickster**."" and Morpeth Jetsan is an anagram for ""Phantom Jester."" Probably a coincidence, but a thought it was interesting.

However, there was already a clone in the acid pool, although it was more of a blank slate. When Martha asked what the hand sticking out of the pool was, the Sontaran answered: ""It... will soon be you."" It then proceeded to ""pump"" Martha's information into the blank clone body.

The Sontarans are big on cloning anyway, so I'm pretty sure it's not the Flesh. Also, if I remember correctly, Clone!Martha pointed a gun at the Doctor. This wouldn't have happened if she were a Ganger because it would still have all of Martha's memories with him, and would never do something like that (unless there was another Solar Tsunami -- but that's a whole other birthday).

One miserable grey wet Friday evening earlier this year I'm on a train home with a carriage of commuters all wearing a world-weary ""I'm glad the week is over"" expression.

A late-teens kid gets on with his phone blaring really full-on/offsensive-lyric gangsta rap.

People look up at him, he struts around for a bit and then lounges across a double-seat with his headphones on his shoulders giving everyone the ""come and stop me then"" expression - happy that he's being the epitome of coolness. This goes on for a few minutes while the carriage occupants do that whole ""lets wait and see who tells him to turn it off"" thing. 

All this time his phone must have been on random shuffle as its been bumping between gangsta tracks. 

And then comes a moment of pure beauty... while he's being all uber-cool his phone shuffles from some ""I'm gonna do you with my Uzi, Mofo"" type track to Michael Jackson's ""Ben""

Cue an entire carriage laughing out loud at this kid who then goes bright red and gets off at the next stop while a group of people are singing ""Ben the two of us need look no more..."".

Gotta love shuffle karma!

oh and maybe you think you're in a higher class of being than Kanye but actually he's quiet a cool guy, you simply hate him because you've been taught to hate him by the classist structure of our vile society.  I bet you barely know a single thing about any of the people you have a problem with nor the musical choices kids make.  A lot of people are jabbing their fingers about in this thread suggesting playing classical music at the kids as if it's going to somehow melt them with culture, well guess what?  Most of the music you're talking about was massively controversial among outdated conservative dinner party guests (now redditors since everyone learned not to invite them to dinner anymore) the interesting thing is that these great old classics are an integral part of most modern music and the kids know this - the tradition of being involved in making music lives on in most the 'repetitive buzzing' you stick in the muds hate so much, if you talk to them about music these kids understand instinctively the post-Baroque and Galant styles to a much higher degree than most hipster posers; there is a reason songs like this http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMjbyrVQTkM or http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhP1liaogwQ or http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dhcvff8vQDc work so well and are so easy to produce - the music fits because they're intrinsically linked.

HOW LOUD IS TOO LOUD?

I'm trying to understand the modern social compact and what to do to enforce it as necessary.

Other people's volume level is indeed a small thing, but a huge thing if you commute daily on a train, and use that time to supplement sleep, work, and other downtime and decompression techniques, such as reading, thinking or just being zen by looking out a window.

If there's someone having a conversation that is loud enough for you to hear every word, and those words are competing with your sleep or your own private thoughts, is that the official level of ""too loud""? And what do you do about it?

If there's someone having a conversation, and I WEAR EARPLUGS to minimize noise, and I CAN STILL hear every word, is THAT the official level for ""too loud""?

Is it appropriate, acceptable and/or encouraged to enforce reasonable conversational volumes by asking politely for someone to quiet the fuck down?

I've witnessed other people ask politely to quiet down, or turn the volume down, and speaking from this personal experience, the responses run the typical gamut from reactionary swearing, to apologetic acquiescence.

2. Splitting the budget for the season over the course of 2 calendar years (not sure how BBC does fiscal years, but based on the previous schedule it really seems like they budget by calendar year), with the expectation that the economy will have stabilized a bit. The UK is facing really rough budget decisions right now and no government funded entity can be too demanding.

&gt;Twelve per cent of London’s men are black. But 54 per cent of the street crimes committed by men in London, along with 46 per cent of the knife crimes and more than half of the gun crimes, are thought by the Metropolitan Police to have been committed by black men.

1. Writer can't spell Ood.

2. S6 Part 1 DVDs are already out, and there's no reason to believe S6 dvds won't be ready to go for Christmas. Teasers say late summer/autumn, not November. Transparent ploy to get hits.  

3. Complete loss of credibility by saying that Starz owns Torchwood. It's still a BBC production, but Starz kicked in cash for US distro rights. Totally unprecedented... unless, y'know, you ever watched Rome or any of the other BBC/US collaborations over the years.

4. Gaiman writing above budget is more of an inevitability than a shock. He's been wanting to write a DW script for years, so he was clearly going to go big and then see what had to be trimmed. From his blog, it seems he was very happy with the Ood incarnation of the character. It's a brilliant reminder that they were so numerous/ubiquitous as an enslaved race that any little pile of intergalactic detritus would have one.  Massive budget does not necessarily mean better creative choices (see: Hollywood).

5. People have creative differences. People leave shows for all sorts of reasons. This is part of the creative process. Without an on-the-record source and details, that producer infighting portion of the story is vapid dramawhorage. Yeah, it's hard to get people OTR but you can do it if the situation is genuinely dire. Sources won't go on the record when they're gossiping and speculating.

Part of the problem was that in Doctor Who, Jack was portrayed as a funny and happy-go-lucky, pan-sexual character who wanted to mate with all sorts of beings regardless of gender. In Torchwood, he was basically a gay guy with a past he regretted, which wasn't nearly as fun or as interesting... until Children of Earth.

Children of Earth was epic, of course. And now I'm very eager to see Miracle Day.

&gt; The BBC has taken great pains to reassure fans that changes being made in how the episodes are being produced are dictated by the writing staff, and not by budgets. For instance, the strategy in 2011 to split the “Doctor Who” Season 6 in half was based on storytelling elements implemented by showrunner Steven Moffat, and not to help better space production costs over multiple financial quarters, the BBC said.

[unoffical source](http://thetaylornetwork.wordpress.com/2011/06/16/bbc-gives-doctor-who-a-seventh-season/)

&gt; Yet, the BBC couldn’t commit to continuing the show on its own, and instead struck a deal with an American premium cable channel, Starz, to jointly produce a fourth season.

[same unoffical source](http://thetaylornetwork.wordpress.com/2011/06/16/bbc-gives-doctor-who-a-seventh-season/)

I have not found any information about a ""falling out"" with Piers Wenger. The [information](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-13564255) I see is that he is leaving the BBC for a position at Film4.

[More information similar to tgdaily](http://www.bleedingcool.com/2011/06/08/doctor-who-season-seven-the-kerfuffle-part-two/)
&gt; The BBC states that the new schedule was down to creative and narrative reasons. Private Eye states however that delays and budget issues have emenated from executive producer Piers Wenger, who has now stepped down from BBC Wales head of drama, and then left the BBC to work for Film4, and that it was the dismissal of previous producers Tracie Simpson and Peter Bennett by Wenger and fellow exec producer Beth Willis that caused some of the delays and chaos – and who refused to return to work for the pair when the jobs were offered back to them, working on their own show Baker Boys featuring a number of recent Who alumni.


So basically, from what I gathered so far the BBC is saying (and I didn't see an official statement) that the split is due to creative reasoning; however, these other sites are stating that they stem from budget reasons.",0,1308203987,null,0,false,0,c1zzyqn,t3_i0qcv,t1_c1zzyqn,t3_i0qcv,1427250722,1,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,1

true,[deleted],null,null,"""Childish"" does not mean ""for children"". It means ""acting like a child"".

For example, you have a story about an alien that lives off of orgasms. That is a teenage fantasy, complete with random and unnecessary lesbian make-out session.

You have a lot of unnecessary hand-wringing and emotional melodrama. You have inconsistent characterization and bad writing - look at Owen's fate, reduced to being a bunch of sentient particles floating midair. The show's got terrible dialogue and is centred, in its first two series, on Team Incompetent. This trope rolled its way into *Children of Earth*, even, when - in episode four - they get their act together, go into the building, then stand there and talk until they’re gassed and Ianto dies.

The best episode of series one was ""Small Worlds"", with the fairies. What was that? The fairies and their background come from PJ Hammond's spooky *Sapphire and Steel* brain. The team standing around incompetently and watching the girl die was typical *Torchwood*.

A lot of people say *Children of Earth* is the best of *Torchwood*. It is. It isn't, however, very good. You have odd characterization (in episode one, SWAT Lady kills a Doctor in cold blood but is *human* and *compassionate* in episode four though she has little screen-time; in fact, the switch happens mid-scene); you have a fairly odd villain using children to get high, an evil prime minister being evil for the sake of it and unrelenting melodrama. Frobisher's murder-suicide was the icing on top of the cake. 

In comparison, *Sarah Jane Adventures* and *Doctor Who* have much better storytelling, even though *Sarah Jane* is targeted at children.

If you want *real* adult storytelling, watch *The Wire*. That does have some sex and some gore, but it's a masterclass on how to write *properly*. Or, if you want a fun evening of TV, the good *Doctor Who* episodes will do you fine. Just not *Torchwood*.

You are incorrect. They can default, exit the euro, devalue, and recover. In the long term this would be a much more sustainable solution. All that's going to happen with the current policy of bailout to infinity is inflation. Inflation = tax. It is making us poorer, and will continue to do so. The fact is that the financial industry have convinced politicians that it will be the end of the world if they don't get 100% of their money back on those bonds (what the hell is the interest rate for?!).

true,lensassaman,null,null,"Point; we need to keep in mind that FlAmy was mid-level Flesh (I still think ""Advanced Flesh"" is, I don't know, Multiforms or Oods). But either way, the ganger that replaced Amy was as much more advanced as Moffat needed it to be, to pull of the story.

That said, let's imagine that the adversary could pre-create the ganger for Amy based on, I don't know, a picture or DNA sample or something. They still need to be able to pull off the swap in such a way that Amy never notices being kidnapped; she's got to be nabbed and hooked up so her consciousness experiences what Flamy sees, and of course Flamy needs to be dropped in in place of Amy.

Maybe ""make everyone forget by ensuring that they're looking at a Silent while it's happening"" was the approach, but, that seems dodgy. First of all, does one lose all memory during the time they're looking at a Silent, or just the memory of the Silent? That's not exactly clear. Secondly, it would be a rather big gamble that everyone would keep eye-contact with the Silent the whole time.

But then I thought about it more; if the adversary has a time machine, it becomes easier. They could kidnap Amy, take her to their base and take their time making the flesh, then return and insert Flamy one second after they stole Amy. Bystanders don't notice (assuming they can do this undetected; exercise for the reader.) The remaining problem here, of course, is it doesn't fool Amy, who subjectively experiences the entire duration of this procedure.

So, I'm kind of stumped. I thought the logical time for the swap would have been while Amy was kidnapped; maybe right when her palm recording device was removed. But it *had* to have happened before then, or she wouldn't have seen eye-patch lady through the hatch in the door to the room where she was kidnapped. Unless that was just a continuity error.

So you must have had:

* A large(ish) chunk of cash. A months rent in most places is 4 -500 pounds, and you'd also need a few hundred for a deposit, as well as to cover any additional expenses incurred.
* Marketable skills that would enable you, with a reasonable degree of certainty, to find a job in your new location.
* Transport to move your things, unless you rented a van or hired a removal company, which would mean more cash.
* No unbreakable ties to your current location. If you were married and had kids in a school or a wife who did have a job, you might be far less willing to move.


Many people do not have these things, particularly if you're an unskilled worker who has spent the last 6 months living on £65 a week (the current JSA). Try walking into a job center after half a year on housing benefit and telling them you want to move to London to find work.

In my head, after he leaves her the first time, he travels around alone for a while -- perhaps this is when he ended up in all the photos Clive posted on his ""Who Is The Doctor?"" website -- but realizes he needs company and goes back to the last girl he tried to convince to be his traveling companion: Rose. 

She was perfect as a distraction and antidote for his anguish -- sunny, cheerful, loving, kind, and very pretty in a blond cheerleader kind of way. He threw himself into traveling with her, telling himself it was for her benefit, but deep down I think he knew that he needed her there with him, to save him from himself.

When he regenerated into Ten, Rose was the most important thing in the universe to him, and I think it ""imprinted"" her on his psyche. Ten was all about Rose, especially after he lost her. That regeneration was broken without Rose, and losing her changed him profoundly...not for the better.

All of the above is how I tolerate Rose as a character, and how I view the behavior of Nine and Ten. It's just my opinion and speculation, but it keeps me from being quite so irritated by Ten and his horrible treatment of Martha (actually, by that point, he was becoming a dick to everyone, but Martha got the brunt of it) and accept it as part of his character/personality.",0,1308246926,null,0,false,0,c2032hd,t3_i0zd4,t1_c2032hd,t1_c2026t1,1427253552,11,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,11

4. the cost. It's massive and most of it dropped on the public by backdoor subsidies, e.g. [£73bn to take nuclear plants out of service. Cost of decommissioning up by £12bn in two years.](http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2008/jan/30/nuclearpower.energy)

&gt; ...the relatively low price per kilowatt-hour...

Not close. It's a mirage of creative accounting.

The addition of Nyssa only worried me even more, because she and Adric combined really gave a sensation that the show was going to be heading into a pure kid-show realm.

Then we lost Tom Baker and the combination of Davison's fun personality and Adric and Nyssa's youthful exuberance, coupled with the fact that the two characters had some mature and impressive characteristics of their own, not only made me feel the pain of the Fourth Doctor's death less, but also set me up to be enthusiastic for the new season.

I must admit that the loss of Baker wasn't as upsetting to me as Troughton or Pertwee, but that isn't to say I didn't like him as much. It's just how the stories were written and set up.

Of course, I also thought I would hate K-9, but honestly, he's the best dog ever to grace the TV screen.

I guess I started looking for places that the show might jump the shark, but the nature of Doctor Who is such that if it goes in a bad direction, it can not only go in a new direction, but it can go in a new dimension.

true,BraveSirRobin,null,null,"&gt; The premise of the action in Libya I'd say is something to kind of be proud of. 

This is what makes me **least proud** to be in this country. Our action in Libya is entirely self-serving yet people believe it to be ""just"". It's disturbing. 

Britain has spent the last five years [felating Gaddafi](http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2009/oct/26/gadaffi-libya-good-relations-uk). Just look at [that smile](http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/41767365/ns/world_news-mideast_n_africa/t/west-may-rue-embracing-gadhafi/). We [released convicted terrorists to secure oil deals](http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2009/sep/05/straw-admits-oil-role-megrahi-talks). Until six months ago Gaddafi was all [set to be entering the western trade world after years of sanctions](http://www.sourcewatch.org/index.php?title=Libyan_oil_industry). Then Egypt happened and we lost one of our [most reliable dictators](http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/feb/02/tony-blair-mubarak-courageous-force-for-good-egypt) in the region. They worried that Libya would follow, so the [SAS were sent in](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/africaandindianocean/libya/8365069/Libya-SAS-mission-that-began-and-ended-in-error.html) to establish contact with the rebels to ensure that they saw things our way. Their international support [hinges on oil deals](http://uk.reuters.com/article/2011/06/04/uk-energy-libya-deals-idUKTRE75154P20110604). 

Unfortunately things did not go to plan. Gaddafi remains in power and we've backed the wrong horse. So were are quite literally bombing the crap out of them on a daily basis. Any premise that we are ""protecting civilians"" was blown right out the water when we [took out their navy](http://articles.nydailynews.com/2011-05-21/news/29583899_1_nato-forces-nato-warplanes-ports). The UN mandate was to use force [only to protect civilians.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Security_Council_Resolution_1973#Key_points) We are now directly fighting on the losing side of an extremely bloody civil war. Besides us extending a conflict that will not be won and being partly culpable for all of the civilians that have died as a result of it (in addition being directly culpable to those our bombs have killed), the war in it's present form is completely illegal under international law.  

If the above links &amp; context are not sufficient to prove that this has absolutely nothing to do with human rights or anything other than self-interest for oil access, then consider our staunch allies [Bahrain](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bahrain_%E2%80%93_United_Kingdom_relations). Right now there are daily protests being [brutally suppressed](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hNrxQorrZtE) by a government we fully support. They are being assisted by [another of our even closer allies](http://ukinsaudiarabia.fco.gov.uk/en/), Saudi Arabia, who have [sent tanks](http://www.businessinsider.com/saudi-troops-bahrain-2011-3) to take on the protesters. Note that these are *peaceful protesters*, nothing like armed rebels in Libya. Saudi Arabia itself was [among the first to use violence to prevent protest](http://english.aljazeera.net/news/middleeast/2011/03/2011310185818570316.html).

While the BBC is something to be proud of for drama, comedy, music and so on, it's news reporting is basically a government mouthpiece. The coverage of our wars is very deliberately biased in support of government action, carefully spelling out the spin to make intelligent people like yourself believe that these wars are just. It has been like this ever since the Hutton Report bitch-slapped them for saying something that was later proven to be completely accurate.

It's calmly watching the second massive nuclear catastrophe in 30 years when the nuke lobby promised us they were statistically only supposed to happen every few century or millennia - if at all. It's then calmly deciding that the risk is not worth it and is not necessary.

Just give a little thought about a meltdown in the UK. My favourite is - coincidentally - Hinkley Point. Draw a 50-mile evacuation radius around it. That includes Bristol and Cardiff, plus who knows how many towns and villages. Millions of people. Where would they go? You think times are tough now? Try a nuke meltdown on this crowded island.

The nuke industry is a money-making scheme for the plutocrats. Renewables democratises and spreads the wealth. Also, renewables offer the best solution for global warming mitigation. Before the Tories disbanded them:

* Nuclear Power Won't Fix It. Nuclear power is not the answer to tackling climate change or security of supply, according to the Sustainable Development Commission. ""...even if the UK's existing nuclear capacity was doubled, it would only give an 8% cut on CO2 emissions by 2035 ... nuclear power has benefits, but in our view, these are outweighed by serious disadvantages. ...it is indeed possible to meet the UK's energy needs without nuclear power. With a combination of a low-carbon innovation strategy and an aggressive expansion of energy efficiency and renewables, the UK would become a leader in low-carbon technologies. This would enhance economic competitiveness whilst meeting the UK's future energy needs."" http://www.sd-commission.org.uk/presslist.php/51/nuclear-power-wont-fix-it + http://www.sd-commission.org.uk/publications.php?id=344

&gt; Kate Hudson, General Secretary of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, said “Whilst Germany and Italy are now set against nuclear power [*valid comparison with similar countries*], Britain seems to be taking almost no account of the lessons that must be learnt from the ongoing catastrophe at Fukushima [*note of event that should act as a warning*]. If the government pushes ahead with new nuclear plans, a wave of civil disobedience will dog construction at each site [*highly relevant as it will result in delays and escalating costs*]. Millions of people live in the areas equivalent to the zones evacuated in Japan [*highly relevant and should act as lesson for this country*]. Are we really prepared to risk our safety [*appeal to sanity*] by pursuing a dirty, dangerous and expensive [*well-documented fact*] technology which cannot make any serious contribution to the fight against climate change [*well-documented expert opinion*]?

Most of your criticism seems to be that this article does not include a highly detailed explanation for every assertion made. That's intellectually dishonest - dismissing something because it does not meet post hoc standards that you set. Also a little puzzling given the fact you admit you don't know much about the subject.

However, here's some of it:

That's a bit of my point. 9 is most def raging from the war and you can see he is just angry. This has lead him to see for instance almost kill that contaminated dalek, or almost turn (what's her name?) to the police where she'd be most certainly put to dead.

10 just had too much attachment to his companies. Always willing to put everything in the line for them. Like sacrificing everything for rose. He always came through at the end, but his companies were clearly a weakness.

11 to me is just perfect. He makes the tough choices and lives with them. Yah he risks to save his companies, but you just know that if the choice was between Amy and the Universe, he wouldn't even think twice. 11 is a dark person that does the right thing regardless. He does his best to save the people around him but also makes the tough choices.

Just my opinion :)

&gt;The term reboot, in media dealing with serial fiction, means to discard much or even all previous continuity in the series and start anew with fresh ideas.[1] Effectively, all established fictive history is declared by the writer(s) to be null and void, or at least irrelevant to the new storyline, and the series starts over as if brand-new.[1]

&gt;Through reboots, film franchises are revamped and reinvigorated to attract new fans and stimulate economic revenue.[1] 

""Much"" of Classic Who was discarded int he new series and although they refer to past Doctors, those adventures can be thought of as ""irrelevant"" past the fact that they made the Doctor famous.  The purpose was certainly to attract new fans, and it came on the heels of the movie, which we can all agree was a reboot.

true,[deleted],null,null,"Kinda missed School Reunion and most of the later Doctor cameos in the Sarah Jane Adventures, didn't you? The old stuff is NOT irrelevent, no more so than many of it was back in the day. No plot threads from the old series are being picked up because *the old characters who would be involved are mostly dead or time locked.* They've been put on a bus. As we saw, they can come back whenever the authors feel like, if they can come up with a clever enough explanation. See: the End of Time. 

The fact is that specific details have never been that essential from season to season, except in fairly rare circumstances involving specific villain arcs. For example, I was able to watch and understand numerous Sarah Jane and 4 serials without having any idea about the Doctor, Ian, Barbara, and Susan. Is every regeneration a reboot? No. 

If the old who were irrelevent, we would not have School Reunion, UNIT's presence in Season 3 and 4, numerous arcs in the Sarah Jane Adventures relating to Sarah herself, Jo, and the Brigadier, the Daleks, the Sontarans, the Cybermen, etc. Nor would we have this constant discussion fo the Time War or these vague references to the Doctor being a father.

Just because you don't need to know something to get the gist of what's going on doesn't mean it's ""irrelevent."" I understand the new series a lot better for having watched the first doctor through a bit past Susan's departure.

This isn't like Spiderman, where we watch it from the beginning all over again, and instead of making his web slingers, they're a mutation. New Who is a revival, because the old continuity still counts, it's just that casting changes make it relevent in big picture only until someone reappears. 

I really don't think the movie was a reboot either, because it directly built on a number of old who elements: Regeneration, the Seventh Doctor, the Daleks' complicated relationship with various Time Lords, the Doctor and the Master's complex and vague history, and the Master's penchant for escaping death.

I have watched School Reunion and I feel that that attack and my down-votes are unmerited. I was merely suggesting that Doctor Who is a show that is approaching a 50 year anniversary.  It is only possible for them to throw out the cannon that they dislike and keep the bits they like when they refresh the series for a new audience.  Whether you call this refresh a ""reboot"" or a ""revival"" is largely semantic, but there are instances where they ignore Classic Who events.

To be precise, I am thinking of the moment where Jack asks if The Master is the Doctor's brother, as he was in the movie, to which the Doctor responds that Jack should not watch so much television.

I consider time locks and busing characters off as merely clever plot devices that ""discard much or even all previous continuity.""  If we consider series that have lasted decades beyond the normal lifespan of a television show, they are all cartoons like Spiderman where Manhattan is destroyed and then it is back next year. The reason that Doctor Who has survived as long as it has owes some of its success to the fact that it can ""reboot"" elements of its plot every so often.  Although we have continuations in storylines across some Doctors (9-10 can be thought of as one storyline), sometimes the character is traumatized so far (think of the Wilf-Master-Doctor-Cry-Sessions in EoT) that the only way to keep the series going is to start over.

No one's saying that ""revival"" isn't the best word. I just think ""reboot"" also fits. I only have so many opportunities to be snotty about Doctor Who to my uneducated friends.

My other theory (which I don't like as much, but is probably just as likely) is that the older doctor was the one in the suit, and the younger one was the one that ""died"".

The Falklanders have chosen to remain part of the British Isles  (87% in favour of refusing all sovereignty negotiations with Argentina) and the Argentine arguements are based around historical occupation and renunciation of the islands by the British (something that is contested as one of the British claims is that the British have never renounced their claim since 1690).

But if we're to take historical grounding and stating that the Falklanders were not indigenous to the Islands, then we can flip that around to say the Argentines were not indigenous to Argentina and so should leave that country to return to Spain. Also, the number and duration of occupations moots their 2 years and 7 months (total) of control of the islands.

I guess their strongest point is the illegal invasion by the British, which is in itself debateable if the claim that the British have never renounced sovereignty since 1690. But then the Argentines illegally invaded in the 80's and were defeated which works more effectively against them.

The only reason both nationes truly want the Falklands is the speculation of vast reserves of oil, but I think all that matters is the will of the locals, not the two powers holding the dolly by each arm and pulling with all their might.",0,1308296473,null,0,true,0,c20855y,t3_i1nl6,t1_c20855y,t3_i1nl6,1427255942,16,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,16

Personally I think it is a bit rich parents complaining about this.  If your children are watching too much stuff that is overtly sexual and you don't like it, stop them watching it.  I'm sure X-Factor or whoever would stop putting it on if their viewing figures slumped.  Surely the medium that you are watching it through (iPlayer, YouTube, TV or VHS) shouldn't matter.  Just pay more attention to what your kids are doing.

* Explosive acceleration, may lead to him fading out in closing minutes of games.
* Has the ability to take on and beat defenders.
* Has a history of injuries
* He is very good with his left foot, precise enough to take free kicks and curl shots around keepers
* He ONLY has a left foot, and will always seek to get the ball onto it (sometimes to the detriment of buildup play)
* Has no crossing or heading ability
* Is a centrally trained winger. Thus, is not a 'hug-the-touchline' winger, and will always drift inside.

I saw Lady GaGa all week in London (twice) and frankly it was a horrifically unsexy show, it was to the Stones as DH Lawrence is to Mills And Boon -they fill every page of Mills and Boom novels with salacious scenes simply because they can't provide the real honeydew of Love Among The Haystacks overflows with.
  
[Music you hear in your groin](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZ13jHp7_P4) is sex in music - this softcore visual they run along side the videos is not sex in music.  I just read Bret Easton Ellis's first novel, it's a really fascinating look at the disenfranchised youth and one little tick stuck out at me which totally summed up something - the main character frequently puts on MTV then turns off the sound, this really sums something up - it's not about the music, it's about the flashing lights and dancing girls -that's why every pop show always gets bigger and bigger, it's why kyle needs waterfalls and mock Greek pillars and fireworks and dozens of dancers -that's the entertainment, the music is incidental.  [music that makes you feel it](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI339U6GS9s) still exists and yes this video is fucking sexy as fuck - it's not as sexy with no sound or another song covering it, it's exceptionally sexy because of the music.  
  
If anything pop is diet-music, to replace the sugar they've added a fuck load of artificial sweeteners in the form of plastic tits and photoshopped asses - yes this view of sexuality as a corporate imposed scale upon which only a few expensive bodies ever match up to the idealistic and insane demands of pop is absolutely terrible thing to teach an impressionable young mind, that doesn't mean sexuality in music is wrong - kids need to learn sexuality, they need to learn how to fit into their bodies and sorry but this starts around the age of 12-13 it's biology and if we try to repress it then, well look around you -things get fucked up.

With the private sector a majority (outside of private contracts to the government) of taxable income is new revenue.

I was about 13 and navigating and my dad was driving. We were staying off the motorways and sticking to the N roads. Went in the town at one end, turned the corner and the entire road was lined with market stalls. At the far end was a stall that blocked the road. He wasn't moving. There was a bit of a stand off, and when it became clear that he just wasn't moving we started to reverse. Not entirely sure what happened, I suspect Dad was just flustered, but he didn't see the caravan was turning into the stalls at the side of the road as we reversed. Tomato carnage. 

We'd arrived in France the night before. We drove to Dover from near Leeds, got the ferry over to Calais and then camped up after a short drive to get some sleep. We parked behind a big Belgian lorry that belonged to some kind of motor racing team. We could never prove it but I am sure they loosened the nuts of the wheels on the caravan. 

This was literally within a week or two of Heisel happening and we were considered scum all over the continent.

However, the last protest did see a blurring of the lines between those who were protesting under a UK Uncut banner and the Black Bloc pricks, but UK Uncut is not a unified group, it's more of a franchise operation.

What they did do is deliberately set out to stage a civil disobedience protest, and the wording of their aims is not that far off of the wording of the legal definition of criminal trespass. And they got arrested for that, which I don't see as a huge problem, but that is beside the point now.

With the EDL, there have been EDL protests where they just rolled into somewhere and spent a few hours being loudly racist before fucking off to whatever hovels they came from without causing much of a problem. But there have been far more protests where they decided to smash up a bunch of shit, or got into fights with UAF counter-protesters, so there is a legitimate reason for the police to prevent their protests from taking place, especially if they are blatantly targeted at areas with a high population of Muslims and the only aim is to start a fight.

My comment was basically that if this was a UK Uncut protest, and not an EDL protest, we would see far more comments supporting the argument of the police actively suppressing the right to protest or that they are little more than a political enforcement arm of the state, and little questioning of the methods used to protest or discussion of collateral damage.

Time And Relative Dimension In Space

The TARDIS has appeared many times throughout history, records of it have been appearing since the dawn of man. It is said to be a time machine of a man who simply refers to himself as ""The Doctor"". People Have even reported to have met The Doctor, or gone as far as saying that they have traced with him. People have been studying The Doctor and it appears that wherever, or whenever he may go, danger always follows in his path, normally at the hands of alien species. The most frequently appearing race to appear in his path is a species known as the Daleks, they are known to be extremely deadly and kill (eliminate) everything in their path.

The TARDIS has been shown through pictrograms in cave paintings, where the one who is supposedly The Doctor assists in giving fire to early man. Through almost every instace of The Doctor, he is described differently, to date, we have found eleven different appearances of him. The inside of The TARDIS, as described by someone who travelled in it, Martha Jones, is much bigger on the inside; it has many rooms, but is hardly ever explored. Ms [or Mz, hard to tell] has stated that most of the time she stayed in the main control room of the ship.

The TARDIS has also been found in war, one instance being World War II in England, which is assumed to be the home country of The Doctor, although he is said to originate from a different planet entirely. When the TARDIS appeared in WWII, Prime Minister Winston Churchill had The Doctor assist in a side war against the Daleks, who were masquerading as a new form of technology to be used against the Germans by the British.

We had, surprisingly enough, been able to get photos of each doctor, the pilot of the TARDIS. These are the 11 Doctors to date.

I mean let's have a look at the logistics from touring festivals as a small band ( traditionally the way you promoted the records that made you your bread and butter ) 

OK, as a small independent band you'll be ( very ) lucky to get £1000 from a festival gig ( well known bands command a lot more obviously, but we'll look at your average small band ) So £1000 + say £300  to hire a van ( including fuel ) + food and drink for the journey, say £30 each. 5 of you in a band and you're lucky to be taking home £100 each. Throw in a sound engineer ( £150-250 per gig  ) and it's a lot less. If you're playing a venue with another couple of bands you'll get less than this too. Once the band gets a little bigger it improves, but then you have to employ drivers, tour managers etc. and then to top that all off sometimes you'll play to an empty house because the promoter has done a shit job... so you get nothing. Support a large band on a tour and you pay for that yourself, it's called pay-to-play in this industry. 

I mean it's hardly a decent living, but there again it never was, you made your money from record sales - record sales that don't exist any more because everyone takes your music for free.

They played most major roles: 

encouraging poor lending to satisfy political objectives

keeping interest rates too low for too long (Fed)

removing regulations baring banks from engaging in businesses outside their normal competence and which endangered insured deposits

removing regulations for most derivatives so no market information was available nor were activities on balance sheets


changing regulations of rating agencies so rating service was paid by sellers

I interpret that chuckle of ridicule as a test and a turning point for the Doctor taking the Rory/Amy relationship seriously.

Moffat has handled the companion dynamic really well IMO because he recognized what the Doctor is forced to confront in this scene -- solo female companions fall in love with him, and this is a well-worn path to misery. He likes the connection and the loyalty (and the chemistry/eye-candy factor works for the viewers), but the aftermath is unfortunate.

Series 1 was designed as a ""beginning,"" in that while it respects the first 26 seasons' worth of continuity, you don't need to see any of the early episodes to understand everything.  It's a fresh start and was designed that way.

Be warned that the first half of Series 1 is pretty high on the cheese factor, but it gets much, much better in the second half.

Series 5, being that it starts with a new Doctor, new companion, and new head writer, is a decent place to start.  It was also designed to ease new viewers in, though not necessarily as the same ""starting point"" that Series 1 was.  There are things that come back from series 1-4, so you'll get more out of it if you start with Series 1.

What several of my friends did was start with Series 5, then go back and watch from Series 1 onward when they decided they liked the show.  Series 5 is a much easier pill to swallow than Series 1, too (substantially less cheesy from the get-go).

Also, and this is **very important**:

If you start from Series 1, **do not forget to watch the Specials** that take place between Series 4 and Series 5 (""The Next Doctor,"" ""Planet of the Dead,"" ""The Waters of Mars,"" and ""The End of Time"").

Sounds like that school will be back in the courts soon fighting a gender discrimination case too.

So if it's not a family tradition it's not protected? This ruling is inadequate. I can think of an obvious case it doesn't cover: a fashion associated with lesbian culture is short hair, schools often don't like girls having short hair, so if a young lesbian comes to school with hair they don't like and it isn't a ""family tradition""?

&gt; Sylvain Marveaux will not play for Liverpool next season. According to information from Football.fr, the Rennes [player] has failed a medical on Friday. The attacking midfielder of the Red and Black, has just learned the bad news was the cost of his groin problems. Last November, he was seriously injured against Brest in the league and has not played since. The International Hope is a free agent.

&gt;Bad news. Sylvain Marveaux, out of contract at Rennes, was involved with Liverpool on Saturday. But according to information from Football.fr, the attacking midfielder has failed the medical examination, the last step before finalizing the transfer. The reason: his groin [was] damaged by a serious injury last November. [Liverpool] have made the decision to halt talks on Saturday in the wake of the verdict of doctors.

&gt;Everything was [set] and a salary of 60,000 euros per week (a figure quoted by The Guardian) [awaited] the brother of Montpellier Joris. [After] an outstanding 2009-2010 season on the left wing of the Red and Black, Sylvain Marveaux was the target of the Reds for many months. Last March, he had already denied a report that he had engaged with the club for eighteen crowns champion of England.

&gt;Overall race since last November

&gt;November 20th, the occasion of the 14th day of Ligue 1, [is the date that Marveaux had a] serious injury during a game against Brest. Verdict: ""significant muscle damage,"" revealed the SRFC website three days later. An absence of four weeks was intended. Yet another blow to the player trained in Rennes. After rupturing the cruciate ligaments of the knee in 2005 during the Euro U19, he had already suffered a serious groin injury with the hopes in August 2008.

&gt;Two years later, in August 2010, it still hurt. Before returning to a low level and then to complete his season prematurely in November then. ""You will never see Sylvain Marveaux with the jersey of Stade Rennais again"", said its president Pierre Dréossi in February on the club website. ""He has hardly played this season and [that is] expected of him. Other players have taken the place and showed they were ready. I think, for example, Yacine Brahimi or Abdoul Camara. "" The career of [Marveaux] had to restart at Liverpool. Not being put off [by the news] (his medical problem is less serious than a heart desire [?]), [Marveaux] is now seeking a club willing to take the risk to sign him.",0,1308342995,null,0,true,0,c20bzwa,t3_i2bhi,t1_c20bzwa,t3_i2bhi,1427257826,1,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1

Part of Omega now lives inside her, although seemingly dormant beneath the surface, making her will tangible. The Doctor realizes that something isn't right with this girl, so he brings her along in his travels. Omega builds the Pandorica out of Amy's memories, but Amy is subconsciously able to influence this, bringing Rory back to life and not just as a Rory-shaped centurion.

When the universe reboots, Omega is still part of Amy, and that helps speed up the ""evolution"" that makes Melody/River part timelord. Now for a time everything is going fine and normal and everybody is happy, until eventually Omega is strong enough to take full control of Amy/River's body. He then uses his will to gain the allegiance of Madame Kovarian, the Silence and the Clerics to use Time Travel to perform the switcheroo on Amy, allowing Omega to manifest quicker than he originally did. The spacesuit is created by the Silence to help keep River's body alive, so that Omega can become tangible again.

Eventually the Doctor defeats Omega and River is released, but in order to do this, he has to allow Omega to take his body. They have a war of wills causing a regeneration on the 50th anniversary, except two bodies come out of this regeneration; the next Doctor, and the Valeyard. The Doctor recruits his past incarnations to again reboot the timeline and stop the Valeyard.

true,PSBlake,null,null,"In point of fact, the full run of Doctor Who televised stories clock in as follows:

Classic series:

* 686x 25-minute episodes = 17150 minutes
* 13x 45 minute episodes (Season 22) = 585 minutes
* 1x 90 minute specials (The Five Doctors - Not counting McGann Movie, since that counts for the Eighth Doctor) = 90 minutes

2005+ series (inclusive through the end of series six, not yet aired):

* 78x 45 minute episodes = 3510 minutes
* 6x 60 minute specials (Most Christmas specials and most series 4 specials) = 360 minutes
* 2x 75 minute specials\* (Voyage of the Damned + End of Time Part 2) = 150 minutes

Grand total: 21845 minutes = 364.08 (ish) hours.

However, ""hours of television"" can't really be directly compared to ""pages of novels."" Of course, if you counted each novel as a four-part TV episode (as many of the classic serials were), then the Eighth Doctor would have at least 121 hours in the BBC Eighth Doctor Adventures alone - and such a calculation would be rather conservative, since a single page of a novel can easily translate into more than a minute of screen time - the Eighth Doctor novels tended to run close to 300 pages apiece.

In fact, to try to get closer to comparing apples to apples, it would possibly be more appropriate to compare the Target Books novelizations of the classic series episodes: These all tended to have 150 pages or less, with one notable exception: The Daleks' Master Plan.

The longest serial in classic Doctor Who history at 12 episodes, the novelization of The Daleks' Masterplan was split into two books, the first running 174 pages, and the second 157 pages - 331 pages to cover *five hours* of television. While the other Target Novelizations tended to condense or excise parts of the plot for length, this two-parter covered the full length of the 12-part serial in extraordinary (some might say *excruciating*) detail.

Using that as a yardstick, I think it would be fair to say that each of the Eighth Doctor novels would translate into a minimum of four hours screentime - bringing the Eighth Doctor's screentime up to 297.5 hours, counting the Virgin Books novel *The Dying Days* and the 1996 telemovie.

""Aha,"" I hear you saying, ""but the EDA line was matched book-for-book by the Past Doctor Adventures line, thereby putting the other Doctors squarely in the lead - and let's not forget the Virgin Missing Adventures or the New Adventures, eh?""

True that. The MAs, NAs and PDAs would add another 676 hours (using the same conversion of 4 hours per novel) to the other doctors. 1040 hours to the Eighth Doctor's paltry 297.5? Not even a contest.

Big Finish to the Rescue! Since signing him in 2001, the Eighth Doctor has been the lead in:

* 30x 120-minute Monthly Series releases
* 34x 60-minute New Eighth Doctor series releases

Pouring another 94 hours into his bucket - 391.5 hours total now, but nowhere near the 1040 total for all other Doctors. And that's not even starting to count the 118 other Monthly releases starring other Doctors.

I could go on to the comics, but there's not really an objective way to convert a page of a comic into screen time, and he'd still lose to the total.

So, yes, you're right. Not more than all Doctors combined - but definitely more than any single Doctor, and more than any two combined. I apologize for my hyperbole, but hopefully I made up for it with the thoroughness of my calculations.

But seriously, he has a very simplistic approach to science. He views evolution as a process which has produced a static result we see today, but ignores that evolution is not a static process and that we are still evolving today. He also ignores how cross breeding between sub groups of various species has resulted in new sub groups being produced which are separate from the 2 parent groups. He also ignores that species and subgroups are not static, and that they have migrated through out history, this is why humans are everywhere, and this is migration is particularly present in the middle east. I'm a living example of this.

This is odd, because he is an American, and America is a nation which owes it's entire existence to migration, and a nation where multiple ethnic groups have migrated to, mingled, mixed, interbred and become united by culture, which is the overriding and defining part of America.

He also paints the comments made by various EU leaders about multiculturalism as being about race, which wasn't the case. The comments were about re-asserting cultural values and a need to ensure that migrants who stay do integrate on a cultural level.

He talks about a world which is getting more hostile and violent, when actually it's trending towards being more stable and peaceful, helped by globalization creating a web of trusts and trade which have acted to slow and prevent wars. And ignores the role of European racial superiority ideas and the impact it had on colonization.

Lastly, the hostility towards ""jews"" is blatant, and has no real basis in history, or science. For example studies have been done which show that genetically, Palestinians, Arabs and non-European Jews have no distinct differences in their populations gene pools. 

So no, he doesn't really explain much as he's left so much out in order to present a very biased view of the world and his opening premise bares no relation to the world I live in.

My list is definitely, definitely 1980s cliche for the most part, but fun.

Made me think about how early exposure influences taste and whether cinematography styles might be a bit like language skills, something that takes more effort to incorporate into one's range of effective visual storytelling methods after critical brain development periods conclude. 

Anyway, I think it's very cool that OP is showing the kiddo stuff from various decades, even if the older Doctors aren't doing it for him yet. I can't imagine what I'd think of 60s-80s tv/films if I grew up watching nothing but media made in the last 10-15 years.

true,lngwstksgk,null,null,"OK, so I may not have everything worked out yet, but here's my running theory (previously posted in rudimentary form):

This entire season is based on *Julius Caesar* by William Shakespeare and several early bits of the plot start in S5.

Somewhere or other, it was said that *Amy's Choice* was the most important episode of S5, but why? Well, because that's the episode in which The Doctor blows up the TARDIS, creating the cracks in time and space. He was manipulated into this by The Dreamlord (Valeyard?), as there were more than two dream realities in that episode. It's also why Rory refuses to stay dead.

Moving on.

Back in reality, The Doctor becomes Julius Caesar, according to the play (the Nestene Romans even address him as Caesar in S5). He is, essentially, already the ruling power and a great warrior, but is on the edge of declaring himself emperor. Should that happen, River and the others believe it will corrupt him completely, leading to the genesis of the Valeyard. They, then, become the Conspirators of the play, with River playing the role of Marc Antony and Rory playing Brutus (called by Antony ""the greatest Roman who ever lived""). Rory, then, by means unknown, is the Impossible Astronaut who kills The Doctor and is later killed by River.

Backing up again, Madame Kovarian is working for the Valeyard to stop River/Melody from starting the conspiracy that results in The Doctor's death.  The Silence are essentially a red herring, or at best, free neutral agents in the universe, acting as they see fit. 

For a final note of screwy Moffuckedness, the regenerations are reset because the Valeyard becomes the new Doctor and thus has the same 12 regenerations as previous. Since The Doctor became unintentially evil due to hubris, the Valeyard becomes the good guy, technically still an incarnation of The Doctor, and turning the whole season on its head.

* Farscape: A great show, light hearted and fun for the most part, but it has moments where it takes the turn for the dark and completely awesome. It is also the only show that I have watched that took me by surprise when it came to relevant episodes to the overarching plot.

* Battle Star Galactica: Not much to say about this, other than it is one of the best shows I have ever seen. Really, watch this, you have to.

* X-files: I am only on season 3, but damn is this good. Action, suspense, horror and mysteries all rolled up into one. If you think it will be bad because it was made in the 90's, then you my friend are very wrong.

* Stargate Sg-1: Now, I am not a real fan of SG1 but a lot of people are. It has humor, action and overall a good story, especially if you know anything about ancient history and/or mythology.

* Sherlock: While not sci-fi this show is fantastic, sadly though it is rather short.

* Jeckyll: Pretty good, not fantastic, but pretty good. Also it is written by Moffat, so that is a plus.

Many of these are very popular so it's entirely possible you've seen them, but I didn't get around to DW until this year so perhaps you haven't gotten around to some of these. :)

Absolutely recommend:

Rome (BBC/HBO) is excellent. The second series isn't quite as good, but I was glad I got to see more of the characters and the incredible sets.

Sherlock: Moffat's other show. Only 3 movie-length eps out right now, but they're supurb.

Battlestar Galactica -- If you haven't seen it, I would like to borrow your brain so I get to see it for a second first time. 

You might like:

Babylon 5: Slightly dated but unusual in storyline length/development so it's important to start from the beginning.  Devotees consider this one of the best shows made in the 1990s.  

MI-5/Spooks: BBC spy drama available for streaming on Netflix, particularly good if DW/TW leave you wanting more UK television. I've only seen S7-9 so far because my love for [Richard Armitage](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0035514/) was the primary draw, but I like it enough that I'll probably go back and check out earlier seasons.

True Blood - I hate vampire stuff. Anne Rice to Twilight to Bram Stoker, no interest whatsoever. When my friends went crazy for this show, I expected to dislike it but I find it to be an entertaining balance of humor, horror, real emotion and melodrama. 

Star Trek TNG/DS9: I watched most of them back when they aired, and recently found that I really enjoyed revisiting them (usually by putting them on while I was multitasking).

Frankly, your mileage may vary on how much you like Rose.  A lot of people never get beyond the ""she's a dumb bitch"" bit of her characterization, but I personally love her as the nuWho companion with the most character development (that sticks).  Which might no longer be true since Rory's come a hell of a long way since his introduction, but there you have it.

Anyway, a lot of people forget to suspend their disbelief with Rose.  The problems she causes in Father's Day are completely stupid to an outside observer: *everyone* knows you don't fuck around with time like that!  Except that doesn't always apply in-universe.  She's watching her father's death, even though she goes into it with every intention *not* to interfere (at least that's what I got), emotions come into play.

Another thing a lot of people hate about her is how (Season 1 finale + Christmas Invasion spoilers) [poorly she reacts to the Doctor's regeneration.  Many people get upset that she ""takes it personally"" so to speak](/spoiler) but, again, you have to look at it from her point of view.  She doesn't have the foresight the viewers do, we [know how regeneration works and accept it,](/spoiler) she has no reason to be anything other than cautious and mildly suspicious after all the things she's seen.

The Children in Need special for that year helped flesh that out a lot, IMO.  It's a short extra scene that helps bridge the gap between the finale and the Christmas special.

my first thought is--much more accessible than I was led to believe. Yes, the alien head looks a bit silly, and I did think it was a bit slow in the beginning, but still enjoyable.

The detective plays an interesting role--very human, and more prone to action and violence (and chopping through foam bricks) than the Doctor. Yet it ends up being his punch that saves the human race. Also, anyone else laugh when he was like, ""it's a spaceship!"" despite (off-screen) having just traveled in the TARDIS?

The Doctor's willingness to let the Jagoroth(?) die is interesting. We have this discussion with new Who about the Doctor's savior/destroyer dichotomy. Here, the Jagoroth's destruction is arguably a fixed point in time, and the Doctor articulates the need for the one group to die in order for new life to form. Compare this to, say, the Vampires in Venice episode, where the Doctor gives the vampires a last chance at life, even though they too were preying on Humans. The lone Jagoroth here actually helped humanity along, albeit for selfish ends, yet he doesn't get the chance to be saved. It's a much more black-and-white morality. I was also vaguely reminded of Lucy Saxon with the wife.

I enjoyed the small scenes--the Doctor's friendship with da Vinci, and his clever use of da Vinci's famous backwards writing; the TARDIS in the art gallery; the Doctor going into the restaurant to say, ""hello, we were the ones getting held up yesterday.""

Not sure what to think about Romana yet. She always looks so young to me. Her outfit reminds me of the ""sailor suit"" girls school uniform. I know she and Tom Baker were married, but...they look rather far away from each other in age. I like her competence, especially with the Doctor. She can keep up with him, not unlike River, and yeet she's obviously got a lot to learn.

More Moffat: Sherlock, as others have suggested, is a masterpiece. Jekyll is fantastic, and if they ever make an incarnation of The Doctor that is further on in age, this show made me want Nesbitt to play him. His character in Jekyll (as Jekyll at least) *is* The Doctor, only with some sociopath thrown in.

Other sci-fi: Firefly, which you've said you are checking out, is fantastic. Battlestar Galactica is one of my favorite shows of all time. It may top Doctor Who for me, but if so, just barely. Caprica (a prequel spin-off) is ok, but pales in comparison.

true,beard-maketh-the-man,eng-yorkshire,Yorkshire,"&gt; Weed is worse than alcohol because smoking weed makes you lazy. Alcohol makes you hung over, and by 3pm you're usually better, although not as lazy as if you'd smoked a 20bag the day before.

Yes, let's ignore the amount of violence, deaths and cancers from drinking too much.  It's not like alchol consumption is a massive health problem in the UK or anything &amp;#3232;\_&amp;#3232;

Ohh no, weed makes SOME people lazy, what's wrong with being lazy again?

I haven't know anyone that's felt worse / as lazy after smoking one night, compared to being hung over.  Last night some friends came round and we smoked quite a bit, well some of us did, we don't push it on people that aren't interested.  I took the time and effort to make some dough and pizzas for everyone (nice and lazy like). Now it's the morning I'm not far off cycling a few miles into town for some fruit and veg, but after I've cleaned the kitchen.  How lazy of me, awake at 7am and soon to cycle 5 miles.

Then I notice other houses in the estate with broken bottles and rubbish on the doorstep.  Ohh look, vomit on the path, that's nice.  Wonder how many people ended up in A&amp;E or a police station because of booze last night. . . . . . I wonder how many ended up in the same places because they had a smoke.

Here's an idea.  Legalise it, it's safe enough and there are millions of users already that cause no problem for anyone.  But because it doesn't agree with you, don't buy any.  With that said, I'll nip to the local shop and buy a bag of organic cannabis and enjoy my weekend by having a smoke, going for a walk and then watching some movies later.

As mentioned in the mid-season finale, all of the events that have transpired may actually be the result of the Doctor's past, present, and future actions. Steven Moffat seems to enjoy using more time related concepts in the recent episodes and seasons, so the ultimate person responsible could be the unintentional actions of the Doctor himself.

The fact that the people who kidnapped Amy's child were after Time Lord DNA generally rules out Time Lords since all they'd have to do is swab their own mouths. Most of the big baddies of the series aren't likely to take such a stupid and roundabout approach to obtaining a Time Lord. The classic groups (Daleks, Cybermen, etc.) mostly either know better by now (which these pawns didn't) or would rather kill the Doctor and then go off conquering the Universe.

By Madam Kavarian's statements along with those of River Song, I think the most likely candidate for primary antagonist and mastermind of this season is The Doctor. The series will culminate when the Doctor has to look back on his actions since the time war and come to terms with the new person he has become in the last few regenerations.

[Use this](http://www.cacaoweb.org/#) to get around the megavideo time limit. Fair warning: running cacaoweb will cause it to add itself as a startup program in your registry. If you delete the entry, it'll just add itself again the next time you run the software. I dealt with this by writing a script that terminates the cacaoweb process and tossing it in my startup folder. There's probably a more elegant solution, but I can't be bothered to think about it. I'll explain how to create the script, fully aware of the possibility that you already know how to do this and that if this is the case I would come off as patronizing.

1. Create a text file

2. Copy this command and put in in the file: taskkill /im cacaoweb.exe /f

3. Save the text file and change the extension from .txt to .bat

Disabled people are at a disadvantage in the job market because of their disabilities, and in the current climate it is impossible for them to find work if they want to work instead of claiming disability benefit. Giving them the **option** of offering to work for below the minimum wage would mean that they actually have a chance of finding work.

The title is misleading in that he's not saying there should be a wage for disabled people and another wage for everyone else, but rather that the disabled should be allowed to have this competitive edge rather than spend their lives unemployed on disability benefits.

Case 1: A disabled person is able to find work at minimum wage or higher. They'll still work that job at that wage - this new proposed idea won't change that.

Case 2: A disabled person can't find work at minimum wage or higher. Then under the new scheme, they can keep looking for work, as before, or they can choose to claim disability, as before, on they can choose the new third option: work for a lower wage.

So who loses under this new idea? With unemployment as high as it is I'm sure there are a lot of unemployed people who'd accept a lower minimum wage if it meant a job.

Warnings were given at the time, and ignored. I'd like to think we're not as arrogant now as back then, but this time we have a much clearer understanding of our vulnerabilities, and the risks to such strategically important islands.

&gt;The islands are pretty impossible to defend though.

We have a fairly sizeable deterrent force there already, not just a handful of marines like last time. And if the political situation deteriorated we'd see a force of Typhoon's and E3's tanked south within a few days, followed by C130's carrying reinforcements. Supplies have been pre-positioned for just such an occurrence. 

The Argentinian army and airforce has been largely left in the same shape it finished the Falklands war in. We, on the other hand, have one of the worlds best air defence aircraft, the worlds premier air-defence warships, a new generation of hunter-killer submarines, and an army battle-hardened by ten years of fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan.

We should bring back all our troops and military assets from American wars, remove them from all our soil, if we are going to be fucked over again lets make sure this time the shits not all 1 way.

Then we can focus what is left of our defence budget on UK sovereignty, and not pretend to have exactly the same interest and issues as the US, when we don't. 

The UK government really has under estimated Argentina, the fact they scrapped the carrier fleet and harriers, just invites trouble, it's 1 of many chinks in the armour. Every year the budget shrinks and the hardware gets less &amp; less.

If it was not for the fact we do have battle hardened forces and some good hardware, and are more ready for an attack. I would really question our ability.

Unfortunately, I can see still see this happening a decade from now as the Orange Order makes no move away from its fundamentally sectarian roots. 

I am convinced that the annual violence would decrease if the Orange Order formally invited Catholics (or Catholic leaders) to the ""family-friendly"" ""Orange-fest"". 

I'm convinced that many Catholics would join in and attend Orange marches (some of them anyway - definitely not in any of the contentious ones mostly in and around Belfast). I know many that would. After all, it's supposed to a be a ""celebration"" of Protestant traditions and culture. 

St. Patrick's Day is a similar festival that is arguably all-inclusive. The leaders of the Orange Order are backward ultra-religious fuckers. 

It's a festival of sectarianism. 

I remember visiting the Apprentice Boys museum in L'Derry with a cross-community youth group but the managers made a scene about the fact that Catholics would be visiting. Eventually they let us all in - but only to certain rooms. At that time, the group of us were between 14-17. 

In saying that, I have friends that are in the Orange Order (and Apprentice Boys) and it's generally not a big deal, but they know I disagree. I grew up in a nationalist area and because of that I am unable to join in the Protestant celebrations. Seems kinda unfair considering that Protestants are included in St. Patrick's Day celebrations!

It may lead to an English/Scottish war if they try to leave the UK... because them leaving the UK and selling the oil to foreign countries would in the long term cripple scotland AND the ENGLAND because we'd have to import a lot more oil than we do already. English food prices would rise due to the oil prices rising, and the standards of life would lower all round. Scotland would BOOM, until the oil runs out. Then they would be seriously fucked. It's cold in Britain and people wouldn't want to come to Scotland for a holiday. 

Look at deportation through law (or my previous comments about this in the UK subreddit). If our government wants to deport an American to go to trial through our courts and be imprisoned, we have to provide evidence of the Americans offense. America doesn't have to provide evidence, they just need 'reasonable cause'.


The UK is also paying £80billion a year into the EU. Or spending this money in other countries. 

Places like Burnley, Birmingham, certain areas in London, and a lot of other cities have black/indian/afghani/pakistani ghettos.

They should be in our country (if theyre legal) but spread out, among native Englanders. They would then speak with a local English accent, and talk English.

Clearly if you have no work experience because you are disabled, it can be extremely hard to find any work at all, even though you are trying to do what the government wants. 

However, as an employer, I'd pick a staff member on their ability to carry out the tasks I require. If it's between taking on a inexperienced non-disabled staff or a inexperienced disabled one, it would be no question (not fair, I admit). At least, this would allow the disabled staff to get the experience to get them self above others in the job market and demand a decent wage.

They were, anyway, occupied since 1820, and in 1825 GB signed a document by which recognised the argentine sovereignty over the islands. In 1829 Argentina sent another group of people (their leader was Luis Vernet, and the people there survived fishing).

As i said, there were people. Argentina didn't fight over them in 1833 (when GB invaded the islands), and instead tried to negociate for a while, until the political situation exploded and forgot about the islands for a while.

true,ravniel,num11,,"Probably our most important season in recent history.  WRad above mentioned the Big Six, and for the moment that's accurate; we're the side pundits mention alongside the Big Four and Man City, and for that we should be proud.  Our position there, though, is incredibly precarious, and the fight for those top four spots is going to be absolutely vicious.  Arsenal need to ward off rumors of steady decline with a trophy or two, ASAP, and Arsene Wenger might honestly be looking to his job if things don't improve.  Man City are absolutely reliant on Champions League money to break even for FFP purposes; it's been the core of their spending strategy these past few years.  Liverpool need to reassert themselves as a rightful Big Four member after two of their worst seasons in years, and prove that the Kenny Dalglish resurgence wasn't a fluke.  Chelsea has a 2011 meltdown to finish reversing.  Ironically I think Manchester United have the least to lose from a poor showing, although the astonishment would be greatest; with their money, their history, and their incredibly powerful international brand, a finish outside the top four would be perceived as a shocking but temporary setback.

If we don't crack the Champions League next season, though, this experiment is over for the moment.  As far as competing for and holding onto top talent, we're already punching a little above our weight in money and prestige; the gap between Spurs and sides like Everton and Fulham is smaller than the gap between us and the other Big Five, and if we don't play well we will find ourselves on the other side of that gap at the end of next season.

I don't know what happened with the people after the invasion, i'm sorry.

As an Argentinian, i'd love them to become part of the Argentine territory. In schools, the Malvinas (falklands) are teached as a ""argentine territory in british hands"". There is obviously a part of me that is highly patritic about it. But i wouldn't mind if they became some sort of independent territory. Actually, what i'd love is to be able to visit them without so much security involved.

My nerves are touched when the british government gives the permission to extract petroleum and other minerals to international companies, even when the territory is: 1) still in dispute (even when the british government pretends there is no conflict, it's there) , 2) so near the Argentine coasts, and 3) GB decides unilaterally they need more territory, so they change the size of the occupied territory, considering british the argentine sea.

But she changed, over time. The Doctor was good for her, and she was good for him right back. By her end, she wasn't a bitch in any bad way, she was *our* bitch, she was mature, she was awesome, and I loved her character. They did something wonderful: took a person I hated, and slowly made her a person I loved. 

And then, they didn't have her leave nor did they kill her. They made her the original dumb bitch. They undid this personal growing-up, this evolution, and made her the ignorant loud annoying bitch I had first met.

Killing her would have been mercy. What they did was destroy her, like she had never been. No companion has had a worse fate, and I pray none ever do. Whoever's idea that was, well done, you got an emotional response out of me.

The reasoning you give for why he needs to be manic makes some sense, but it's purely speculative. And personally, it's the opposite of where I want to see the character go. I've never liked the survivor's guilt/weight of the world aspect to the Doctor since the reboot. My ideal next doctor would explore the other side of his character, being older and somewhat more reserved, in the vein of the 3rd Doctor (and to a lesser extent the 1st and later-period 7th).

The rights to the ocean were extended following the [UN conventions on the law of the sea](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Convention_on_the_Law_of_the_Sea)  which both Argentina and the UK signed.  

This was probably done on behalf of the Falkland Islands Government and the citizens of the Falkland Islands, whose economy is almost entirely the fishing rights.

They already are ""some sort of independent territory"".  They are 1 of the 14 [British overseas territories](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Overseas_Territory). (one of the smallest with a total of 2,955 people living there).   They rule their own lands and territory relying on the UK for defence and foreign affairs.  At any time they wish they could declared independence.

You can read about their government [here.](http://www.falklands.gov.fk/assembly/)

Not sure why you would want to visit them.... its cold there and there isn't much to do but if you want to visit them you could contact [malouines](http://www.malouines.com/es_home.htm) Maipu 26, Floor 2, Apt.""G"" (C1084ABB) - Buenos Aires - Argentina.  As they do tours to there apparently.

You could even move there if you wanted but you would need to have a job arranged or marry a local (this is the same for anyone no matter where in the world they are from, brits as well).

I believe there are currently few Argentinians living on the islands who are working in the tourist industry.

true,lensassaman,null,null,"Yes; so, a brief history of Jack, with unavoidable spoilers:

Jack was born sometime in the 51st century, and presumably lived to about 40 (Barrowman is 44 now, so if we assume Jack was roughly as old as the actor playing him when we first encounter him, let's cut him a little break and say he was 38 when he was rescuing blondes from German bombers.) 

[Then he spends a few episodes bumming around on the TARDIS, until he's killed, at the tragic young age of, let's just call it 39. Then resurrected by Rose. Thus begins his new life as an immortal, age 39.](/spoiler)

[Then he vortex-manipulates his way back to Cardiff, where he's discovered, investigated, captured, tortured, and employed by Torchwood sometime at least a few years after 1879 (when Queen Victoria established Torchwood) and a few years before 1901 (when the Victorian era ended) — we've got a 22 year span of uncertainty here, so let's split the difference and call it 1890. (If anyone knows the actual date Jack was discovered by the Victorian Torchwood team, or more importantly, when he started living in Cardiff (the first time), please comment!) So now, we add 11 years to his life. Call him 50.](/spoiler)

[Then, of course, he spends the next century working for Torchwood, keeping off of UNIT's radar during the years the Doctor is stuck on Earth, and even putting the Cardiff hub on lockdown as not to interact with himself while he was still mortal, when The Doctor stops to recharge at The Rift the first time, but spends his days investigating strangeness that washes through The Rift, waiting for The Doctor to come back to refuel again so he can ""kiss him then kill him"", as he says — presumably, get answers as to why he can't die.](/spoiler)

[So, December 31st 1999, the night the Eighth Doctor is fooling around with fancy clocks in San Francisco, Jack's still in Cardiff, something like 149 years old, when he gets ""promoted"" to head of Torchwood Cardiff. By 2008, we know he's died 1392 times since his discovery by the Victorian Torchwood crew; luckily it seems not to bother him much anymore. Let's call him 157 in 2008.](/spoiler)

[Here's where he steps up and shows Rory what hardcore really means: at age ~157, he gets taken back to Cardiff in 27 AD and buried alive, sentenced to die over and over again for nearly two millennia. I was actually rather bothered by how the show handled this, since you'd think such an experience would drive any man crazy, or at least, you know, have some sort of impact. But, no, when he's dug up in 1901 by the confused Torchwood team (who wonders why the new guy is buried in this hole) he keeps his wits about him, tells them not to tell the 50-something version of him anything and to put his 2031 year old self in cryostasis, where he remains until shortly after his 157-year-old version is taken to 27 AD, where he pops out looking quite sexy for a 2138-year-old.](/spoiler)

[He then spends another two years on Earth before setting off to bum around the universe again, so we know when the Tenth Doctor stops by to say goodbye, and hooks him up with Alonso in the cantina, he's at least 2140 years old.](/spoiler)

Due to the nature of time-travel, he could potentially be older than the 2140 years we've calculated here by the time he reappears in America in 2011 this July, but even if he's only aged the single year, 2141 beats Rory's ~1940 years by a good two centuries.

tldr: yes, by at least 200 years.

Another reason for the limit imposed may be the same reason organisms die. Each time a cell replicates, small errors are created, which cause us to age and eventually die. It might be the same for regen. 13 seems to be a good number, anything after that, and the chance for errors to occur increase dramatically.

I came up with this pondering two things, 1) What could possibly be gained from retroactively destroying the universe. 2) Why can a picture of the silence make people unaware of what they look like (have the same memory effect).

From point two I figured that it must be more of a biological response programmed into every living thing. Since a picture has the same effect as a living silence it implies that any sentient being viewing a silence itselfs decides that forgetting the image is the best course of action. How could this be acheived?

Imagine you wanted to have complete control, on an intrinsic level, of the entire universe and you are very very smart. How could you do this? Well mabe you could try to unravel the depths of the universe yourself, taking years of research . . or maybe you coud find a way to programm additional laws into the fabric of space time itself. Giving yourself ""backdoors to creation"". The silence are infinitle forgetable, therefore they could have been around during the contruction of the pandorica. What if they made sure the particles of matter inside the pandorica followed their addtiional rules for the universe. But then they would need someway to get those rules imprinted on everyspeck of matter in the universe. Or, alternatively you could get someone to do it for you by threatening the universe with some cataclysmic inavoidable event. Like an exploding TARDIS.

The purpose of the TARDIS explosion was to get the doctor to overwrite the current universe with a version that better fits the needs of the silence. The silence have already won. At the end of Series 5 they puppeted the Doctor into defeating himself at the end of series 6.

When the pndorica brought everyone back it did so by scanning every atom of the universe and putting it back the way it should be. BUT, there were no atoms of the doctor to ""put back"". So the doctor got Amy the think really hard so that the pandorica would reconstitute him from her memory. Bur this means it made him from her memory, it didn't rearrange his atoms to put him in the right place, it reMADE his atoms. The original atoms were never scanned , so where are they?

The original doctor is still trapped on the otherside of the cracks in time. The one we are seeing is what was created from the memory of amy pond by the pandorica.

The new limits of the Malvinas are in the space of the Argetine EEZ. So, yes, what they've done exists. But is more complicated than just ""it follows it"". It's more like: ""Hey, how weird. We both have jurisdiction over this place"". But the final decision was unilateral.

I'd like them to be more than just a British overseas territory. I mean, yes, they are quite independent... in the papers. As you can see, decisions about the future of the islands are not discussed with the Malvinas government, but with the British Goverment itself. The foreign policy, as you said, is in British hands. We are not talking about an independent country, completely by itself. We are talking about a colony. They're even under the jurisdiction of the british crown.

Few years ago, there were some problems between the Malvinas Government and the relatives of some of the men who died in the Malvinas War in 1982. There were many mothers, fathers, brothers and sisters waiting to go there and see where their relatives died and visit the cementery. I cannot find a good link on that right now (i'm sorry. Argentinian press is not really professional, i remember reading it on the local newspaper), i can only get links where you can read the info ""between the lines"" and in [spanish](http://www.lanacion.com.ar/1181458). There was necesary a lot of diplomatic meetings to let the familiars go there, and to let a little charter plane from Argentina get there.

Anyway, i think you're right: it is now possible for Argentinians to go there. Nice catch :) Thanks for the link.

There are, probably, a few Argentinians working there, yeah. It's actually something every Argentinian would like to do: place a feet in such an historical place, where such a saddly remided war happened. That's why i'd like to visit them, if you still doubt ;)

true,dodidodidodidodi,scottish,expat,"yes the territorial waters do overlap but i believe they are looking for oil far closer to the islands than the mainland. (i also believe Argentina are looking off the coast of their land too)  Personally i hope they find no suitable oil reserves as it would prevent a lot of stupid trouble.

If every country was to insist about the continental shelves then what about all the Caribbean islands.  Who do they belong to? Where do you stop?

As for the islands, their future is completely in the hands of the people who live there.  The U.N. declares they have this right. [Self-determination](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-determination#The_UN_Charter)  They are no longer just a colony they can do what they wish and i'm pretty sure giving up the rights the UK passport gives them isn't what they want.  (In fact almost every Argentinian i know is busy trying to find a way to get a European passport through parents or grandparents!)
You call the islands a Colony but Argentina would be ""colonising"" the islands themselves if they were to take over the islands. Would the islanders rights be respected?  Up until a few weeks ago there were a large number of Native people protesting in nueve de julio demanding their rights be respected.

I think the problem was that visit was with the large group of families travelling at the same time it became quite political rather than just a few going at a time. (They were sending journalists too.) 

[Here is a story about a man called Horacio Benitez visiting with his wife in march this year](http://www.oldpangbournian.co.uk/Latest-News/News/Argentine-veteran-visits-Falklands-Islands-Memoria.aspx) and [here is the story about the rugby players going to play rugby on the islands](http://en.mercopress.com/2011/03/08/falklands-second-visit-for-argentina-s-rugby-without-borders)

You can understand why having a large group of almost 400 people (from a country that invaded them 30 years ago) to the islands with just 3,000 odd would be quite daunting to the local population. If you treat the locals with respect and don't demand that they give their rights up i'm sure you would be welcome to visit too.

I've spoken to many Argentinians as i live in Buenos Aires and i can tell you that its not ""every"" Argentinian who would like to go there.  I'm sure more would prefer to go to Miami. The fact that you feel some cold, windy and wet remote islands in the middle of the ocean with no historic buildings or history are worth visiting shows that the propaganda of the military junta is still being taught and is alive and well in the schools of Argentina.

Would you rather visit Isla de Pascua or the Falklands?  They both cost about the same to visit.

I was quite impressed by Barbara, given what I'd heard about early female companions. Susan, not so much. She basically gets to be either precocious/clever or...slightly useless. Barbara, though, she's highly educated, sticks to her convictions, and argues with the Doctor. She's fiery. She held a knife to a guy's throat. Even though she had to learn a hard lesson, you get the feeling that she'd still want to try and help people, which is a rare quality to have. Down, but not out.

Ian kicks ass. I swear he pulled a Vulcan nerve pinch--wait. Actually airing-wise, this would have been before Star Trek TOS, yeah? Should be an Ian nerve pinch, I suppose. 

First Doctor is being less of an ass than usual. He shows some real tenderness with the Aztec woman, and I can see hints of stories like Girl in the Fireplace, where a clever woman manages to get the Doctor's attention. I'm used to him being affectionate with Susan, but he also comforts Barbara and he did seem genuinely worried that Ian had been killed. And the moment when he says that history can't be changed--that close-up showed the emotions that really cemented for me that he's the same Doctor I watch in new Who.

I'm guessing this is one of the first times we start getting into the idea of not being able to change history? I could see shades of Ten when First is telling Barbara that they can't change history--I'm half-expecting to hear ""not one line"" (or whatever the line was). 

Pacing was okay. Like, it seemed slow, and yet, at the same time, there were moments that seemed faster. The opening scenes confused me at first--I didn't know why they were in the Aztec Empire. (Probably something from the previous episode), or why Barbara and Susan were wandering around. Towards the end, when the trap with Ian's weapon was sprung, that seemed to have happened really fast. I do like the play-like atmosphere. 

Budget/aging-wise--was it just me, or, in the opening scene where the Doctor and Ian step out to ""see the city,"" were they looking at a painted backdrop? I remember times in The Chase, I think, where they were in a forest, and I was looking at them walking through, well, props or something without realizing it was supposed to be a forest. So, yeah.

My earlier point would be better worded as:

&gt;The reality is that if a politician is going to deliberately misrepresent any given topic then no one can be surprised if a media outlet or others engage in their own misrepresentation or hyperbole in response.

Both can be condemned, and we can each choose to consume certain media and not others, but equally and sadly, we can also choose to sweep up the leaves in the forest.

My point is not that one is right and the other wrong, but simply we cannot change the political and journalistic landscape for a better model. We have what we have, and can understand it and work with it or we can angrily bang our heads against a wall.

Edit: Pie in the sky in know, but I actually think that if politicians were gradually, over time, by some miracle, to become more open and honest the media would, gradually, over time become more open and honest too. But only that way round.

I wouldn't lump all politicians and journalists in together either.  Some are more honest than others.  If we condemn them all as a group, it's then that we shouldn't be surprised if they continue to mislead and distort, as there ceases to be any incentive to do any other - they're going to be cynically dismissed either way.

I also disagree with the one way street idea that only politicians can make journalists more honest.  I absolutely think that some journalists/media outlets lower the tone of debate, and there are plenty of honest politicians who are held back from speaking their minds because certain journalists/newspapers will leap on it, misinterpret it and report it as a gaff.  The press absolutely set the tone for debate, and they are far less accountable, and often more opportunistic than politicians.

I don't understand how saying that the class system is no longer relevant to our lives can avoid the problems of disparity in wealth, status, and values.  The way that the system works ensures that there is always going to be some kind of social hierarchy and those born into the bottom are usually likely to stay there.

I agree with what others have said on here about there being a difference between 'chav' and 'working class'.  From my experience, the majority of working class people that I've met are incredibly hardworking and decent people. They have issues with chavs just as much as any middle class person might.   The only real difference is that the working class are a lot more down to earth and don't judge as much. The middle class react with fear and hysteria.

Gotta say that this article really only shows how callow and out-of-touch the author of the book it's promoting really is. Obviously, I haven't read his work, so might be wrong, but to say that the whole working class is being demonized is bullshit. Nobody has ever equated chavs with being the whole of the working class and to propagate such trite is actually just adding fuel to the fire.   If anything, chavs are an underclass. They completely lack the work ethic that defines the majority of working class people.
