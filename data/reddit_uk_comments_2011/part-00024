Now, I have experienced that myself, my daughter did not sleep from the age of two, up until she was eight. Five nights a week, (on average), for six years we had screaming tantrums, hysterics etc. until about midnight when she would fall asleep,  exhausted. We saw Child Psychologists and Specialists galore and no one could help. We were desperate and ended up giving her a quarter dose of herbal sleep tablets. We hated doing it and she soon got used to them and we gave up, but it was a nightmare and the stress almost killed us all. When we were ""helping her sleep"" though, you can bet we checked on her regularly and would never have left her alone.

The other thing is, when my daughter would sleep with ""help"", when she woke up in the night to use the loo she would be wobbly and half-asleep. It would have been so easy for her to have fallen over and hit her head or something, and she was seven at the time; Madeleine was practically still a toddler and probably still had the 'not-so-excellent' co-ordination for which toddlers are known.

You can see it in the doctor, which went from a troubled character that was very human to the ""perfect alien"" that it seems to be in the two previous series. 

Also, you can see in series 6 that it is set in the deserts of America and a pirate ship instead of the poor areas of the UK, which, from a British point of view, is making the gap between a BBC series and an American-movie-worthy show.

It could be more to do with the stories that are being written which I will definitely say are on the whole a lot better since Smith becoming the doctor, but he never really has those lines and moments when he strikes fear into the hearts of entire civilizations and really takes up the mantle of Earth's protector. Smith kind of does it, but its just not as striking as when the previous two doctors would get serious about a situation. Just my opinion, and I do think that since Davies left the show has calmed down on the whole action heroy stuff and brought the doctor back to more what he used to be, and definitely made him a little more of an intellectual hero.

true,Spungo2ElectricEtc,null,null,"Sort of... It's a practical real-world thing; after a few years of one Doctor the show develops a certain mood, the casting of a new Doctor is an opportunity to shift that mood and give the show a bit of a change. Consequentially, the last episode of a Doctor's tenure is usually about summing up the ""spirit"" of his time.


JNT talked about it specifically in the casting of Peter Davison after Tom Baker, how he had a check-list of things he needed to do to make sure the audience didn't think of Davison and ""Baker-lite"". Logopolis and Castrovalva are two good episodes to compare as they're essentially the same problem (entropy) dealt with in different ways by different Doctors.

For your edification, here is a list of the other doctors and their changes: 



1st (Old and Serious) --&gt; 2nd (Puckish and child-like) 


2nd (Runs away from stuff, talks problems through) --&gt; 3rd (Kung-Fu and Racing Cars) 


3rd (Establishment guy) --&gt; 4th (Bohemian Rebel) 


4th (Nothing can stop him) --&gt; 5th (Vunerable and Open) 


5th (Open and reliable - some say dull) --&gt; 6th (Out of Control) 


6th (Manipulated by others) --&gt; 7th (Manipulates everyone) 


7th (Very Alien) --&gt; 8th (Half Human, sometimes) 


8th (Sweet, caring, and foppish) --&gt; 9th (Hard as Nails)

And for ease of discussion, here's a list of the causes of the regenerations (SPOILERS AHOY): 


* Old age (partly brought about by a Dalek superweapon) 


* Forced by the Time Lords 


* Radiation from returning a crystal he stole 


* Falling from a tower 


* Spectrox Toximia (poison he literally walked into) 


* Banging his head on the console in laser-beam induced turbulence(or forced by the 7th) 


* Walking headlong into a shower of bullets 


* The Time War

Hence why I used this phrase, ""I'm really not a fan of programs that are *entirely* scripted."" Implying that these shows are scripted, just not entirely.

I just think the backlash against reality television should not be entirely based in intellectualism. For example Big Brother can teach you an awful lot about group dynamics, human interaction, outsider hostility, social deprivation, sexual relationships etc. Fictional programs are not so useful in this respect.

&gt;I'm fairly sure this won't accurately capture their lives, rather then sensationalise and straight up lie about it.

Also, the fact that these people are willing to put themselves up for this is quite revealing in itself. They may not be, ""interested in educating you about social scenes or trying to give people a chance to be famous"" but the fact is, that at the very least, the culture of celeb worship and aspiration IS exposed in these programs, and it does represent *to a certain extent* specific cultures. I live near Essex. The bar that was used for a certain marriage proposal in ""The Only Way is Essex"" is my local pub, and the protagonists are friends of a friend. I can assure you that the program is a relatively accurate reflection of the sub-culture it is intended to portray. And they may not be *trying* to give people a chance to be famous, but they do. A lot of characters from the Essex show have done quite well for themselves, and some of them do have positive fame to a certain extent. It has enabled some of the cast members to lead a very privileged life.

true,zmxx,null,null,"It is amazing how many people do not understand copyright. People confuse ""intelectual property"" with physical property. However, intelectual property has no legal definition, it was intentionally created by holders of copyrights, patents, and trademarks so as to confuse the common people into thinking of intelectual property as physical property. See [this](http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/not-ipr.html) nice explanation.

Let me copy what I wrote in a previous post:
Copyright is a **temporary** government enforced monopoly granted to the creator for the sale and distribuition of it's work. Copyright is meant to server as a financial incentive for creator. After the copyright term terminates, the work enters into the public domain.

Notice, the importance of temporary and the importance of the public domain: the work has to be released to the public domain so that other artists/creators can create derived works based on previous works. All artwork is somehow inspired from previous arts.

Notice, that we can claim that copyright is not here for the artists, but really for the public. It is just a financial incentive for artists to bring work to the public: we want artists/inventors to bring artwork to the public sphere so that other artists can grab that work and create other artworks. Now, what seems to be happening is that these copyright laws have become hijacked by corporate interests. They are completelly outdated and not aplicable to the current digital age. Remember: copyright laws are here mainly for the benefit of the human culture and human knowledge (this is my interpretation). Copyright is not a property like a house or a car. It is only meant as a financial incentive for the creator. Are filesharers damaging the incentive for creators to do their work? I don't think so. Even if they are in fact damagin some artists, do the pros outweight the cons?

I could go on and on .... a good reading I recommend is the free ebook: The Public Domain: Enclosing the Commons of the Mind by James Boyle.

I don't think that was the same complaint - IIRC it was something to do with a bit of allegedly indecent exposure. Not quite as earthshattering.

&gt; 2) Surely it doesn't matter if they are complaining because they read about it in a paper or saw it on TV. You can be offended by something you hear has happened (as long as it did, and wasn't a fabrication) even if you weren't there at the time.

I prefer it that only those who have seen the allegedly offending programme can complain - then you can make your own judgement. You cannot do this from a newspaper report or hearsay which may be biased (for example we know how the Mail likes to crucify the BBC for things like not wearing the right colour tie).

It also makes things representative - why should the views of people who would never watch the X Factor in their lives be taken into account?

Is there any evidence of that? MCAT was banned after one death was *attributed* to it - essentially someone did a hell of a cocktail of alcohol, methadone (as in the heroin substitute, not mephedrone - yes I had to check it was the right way around!) cocaine and god knows what else. DailyFail run the headline ""DESIGNER DRUGS KILL"" when really it's someone stupidly mixing a large dose of opiate / alcohol &amp; killing themselves, there's no *scientific* evidence that (in this particular case) that MCAT did anything harmful, but as methadone &amp; alcohol are legal (methadone is prescribed to heroin addicts?)  it doesn't make nearly as good a news story and get everyone worked up about the latest ""drugs menace"".

I'd argue that research chemicals probably have *less risk* to the user as they are at least sold pure &amp; not mixed with whatever the criminal drug supplier has lying around at the time... I've had some mickey mouse e's in my time &amp; the effects of certain things added can be quite unpleasant... whereas each &amp; every time I've purchased MCAT (and similar things) it's been 100% pure, you get to know a sensible dosage and you *know what your ingesting*.

&gt;This doesn't change the point though that there are plenty of illegal recreational drugs that just are not as bad as the legal ones. It is this that has to end. Just let them have their chosen drug, give them the facts, tax it, regulate it, legalise it. I all but guarantee that E'd up chavs would be less costly to society than drunken ones.

I'm not going to to champion any one aspect or era of the show. Climb aboard the TARDIS for awhile.

Take any given situation that your mind can imagine and many others you can't and throw a smart ancient alien with a human assistant/companion into it and bam got your characters (which you can continue to develop), tell a story, any kind of story, really. SciFi, Mystery, Horror, what-have-you, both epic and understated. Pretty awesome concept that has managed to reinvent itself while keeping the core characters and concepts pretty much intact. And since its continuation (not a reboot), it is schizophrenically the longest-running science fiction tv show ever, almost an institution, while at the same time still being the somewhat new kid on the block, as you can see based purely on the number of ""Just watched my first episode and loved it/hated it/on the fence"" posts per week in /r/doctorwho and, of course, the 16 year hiatus.

But my point is not about one particular research chem or another, it's about all of them. They are all (when they first show up) new, and therefore have had little testing. Even at 100% purity the user just doesn't know if they may interact with a relatively uncommon medicine. e.g. a particular sleeping pill or antidepressant could cause serious issues.

Your point about the purity is valid, but this is not because they are research chems. They are more pure because of the nature of the supply chain. 

Despite the grey area nature of Research chems they are more easily traced back to the supplier. If it turned out to be a bag of warfarin the supplier would be traceable in a way that some chap in a pub with a bag of pills isn't. This purity would be matched by the purity of other drugs such as MDMA should they be legalised and regulated. But I think we both agree on that.

The Valeyard is described as being an in-between incarnation, a phenomenon not well understood or documented. His primary motive would have been to get the Doctor executed during his sixth incarnation in order to obtain the remaining incarnations - which would create a massive paradox.

So, basically, the Valeyard comes from an in-between never-time, and wants to commit an act which should logically nullify his own existence, but which (presumably) wouldn't due to his somewhat ambiguous origins.

I submit that the Valeyard is an aspect of the Doctor which came under the influence of [Faction Paradox](http://tardis.wikia.com/wiki/Faction_Paradox) - perhaps his entire existence is due to Faction interference. It all matches: He comes from a gap between continuous moments in time (Similar to the Eleven-Day Empire), and it could be argued that killing his previous incarnation is analogous to Faction initiates' killing off their own ancestors, making their very existence a crime against causality.

Or, if I was in a [John Peel-ish mood](http://tardis.wikia.com/wiki/War_of_the_Daleks), I might argue that the Valeyard was a fake - either a robot or a clone created by the Master in an attempt to further befuddle the Doctor.

I'm studying for my PhD in Evobio and in the last few years there has been a marked increase in creationist groups from the US starting to take an interest over here.

For instance this [book](http://www.exploreevolution.com/index.php) was sent out to schools &amp; libraries all over the country in 2009 (a tactic used widely in the US). From the outside it looks like a perfectly respectable glossy science text book &amp; to anyone with only a passing knowledge of evolutionary theory it would appear to be completely acceptable.

However, it's actually a creationist text [posing as science](http://bcseweb.blogspot.com/p/evolution-exposed.html).

Even my university had the book in the science section and only after they received complaints &amp; realised what it was, was it was moved to theology.

It is this rather worrying trend of sneaking in creationism though the back door &amp; presenting it as real science that has [many people worried](http://bcseweb.blogspot.com/p/about-this-blog.html).

I also demonstrate for 1st year biology classes at my university and there is a worrying number of students that come in that don't 'believe' in evolution...remember these are biology students so I'd hate to think what the numbers are in other subjects.

(to be clear... I don't have a problem with religion being taught in RE, my RE classes in school were very good &amp; I think we should all have a good knowledge of other religions &amp; cultures)

The Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) have been receiving a flood of complaints in recent months, but homeopath Sue Trotter has come up with a sure-fire counter-strategy (mirrored here and here).

It's called the ""Play The Race Discrimination Card"" gambit, and it is the most stupid thing I have ever read.

""Chatting with my husband last night about the complaints by the Advertising Standards Authority here in the UK agains [sic] homeopaths, we think we have come up with a plan to put an end to this nonsense. We can play the race discrimination card if we get this right. Please bear with me whilst I explain. ""

Please bear with me while I explain that this is apparently not a joke.

""If we can find some British Indians/ Pakistanis or Bangladeshi's [sic] they can complain to the ASA explaining that homeopathy is a prefered [sic] system of medicine in their countries of origin, used to treat a wide range of illnesses. The current wave of complaints against homeopaths would therefore seem to be an attack on their culture and beliefs and therefore discriminatory. (I know homeopathy is not a belief system but many think it is, so why not use that to our advantage). If we can get figures for the numbers of people using homeopathy as their primary healthcare in India and the rest of the sub-continent, even better! 

They can also claim that it is akin to Christians claiming that Hindus and Muslims cannot call their beliefs a religion because it is not Christianity. 

If they go on to suggest that the current wave of complaints may have been instigated by someone who has an agenda that is perhaps something other than scientific (just make a suggestion and leave it to them to work out what that agenda might be). 

We would need to get a smart lawyer to draft the letter/s but if we could get the ASA to look at this as potential discrimination that may well decide to back off. If we can find someone on the ASA's complaint list who's [sic] family hail from the Indian sub-continent to complain they are being discrtiminated [sic] against, even better .... and if the ASA find in their favour but still go for those of us of European descent we can then go for a different race discrimination angle. 

Got to be worth a try..... you know how twitchy we are here in the UK at the slightest sniff of racism or other discrimination!

I am not sure how to co-ordinate this so have forwarded to a couple of homeopath groups and see what people think.

Saying girls are more ""vulnerable"" than boys (while perhaps true based only on physical strength) is bordering on 1960s chauvinism. Even if you don't agree with that suggestion, it's a bit of a stretch to say there is any difference in the sexes for young children. There also seems to be a trend in pedos favouring little boys. 

Secondly, any change in vulnerability should not affect the reporting. Is the rape of a man any less newsworthy than the rape of a woman?

&gt; However young missing boys do make the media just as frequently

Completely disagree with every single bone of my body. The first case was an international kidnapping story and quite unique. The second case was local news only.

The best are the ones actually read by David Tennant: Dead Air, The Last Voyage, Day of the Troll, and Pest Control.  And, yes, I listed those in order of best story to, um, least best--so if you don't have time for all four, start at the beginning and work your way down. 
Also, the first three are the Doctor without a companion; the last one is the Doctor and Donna (who you may not have met yet depending on how far into the Tennant episodes you've gotten).

The two read by Catherine Tate (who plays companion Donna)--The Forever Trap and the Nemonite Invasion--are both very good, but if you haven't gotten to season four and don't know who Donna is, you may want to skip them for now.

Finally The Rising Night, read by Michelle Ryan (who plays Lady Christina de Souza (though she isn't doing the same character in the audio) in The Dead Planet (one of the David Tennant specials from season 4.5)) is pretty skip-able.  Of course, I'm just saying that cause I don't particularly like her.  Also, look how many parentheses I needed to explain it!  That's how you know it's not that good.

I was in the 'he saves as many as he costs us' camp until the recent mishaps. Let's just get rid of him, a professional keeper shouldn't be prone to making the number of mistakes (I think mistakes is to soft a word, it should be fuck ups) he makes. It's a fucking joke that his confidence can get so shattered, to the point of being unable to make a decision or catch a ball, so frequently. I would rather have a more reliable keeper who was a slightly worse shot stopper. 

&gt;Maybe a centreback

Definitely a centre back, probably 2 (experienced one and a young one). Get rid of Bassong.

&gt;To get a decent striker

Let's get rid of Defoe + Pav. Defoe (sorry Jermain, I do love you) to a mid table club where he belongs, Pav can fuck off to another country where he can get away with strolling around the pitch and shooting on sight regardless of other options. 

Let's get an ageing superstar if we can't get one in their prime. Someone like Hulk or Aguero would be nice, but unrealistic now we are out of the Champions League. Drogba, RvN, or Forlan are, sadly, more realistic.

I am actually from Wandsworth and it has one of the best provisions of council services despite the lowest council tax in the UK.

When I was little and it was time to go I could literally ""get lost"" in it whilst my parents wearily tried to find me. Wandsworth council's justification of the move is that it is pretty obvious it requires supervision, there are often bigger children pushing other children (the scale of the park is such that it is still quite appealing to even teenagers) and that whilst it is alot of fun the appeal is in the fac that there is quite a real risk of injury.

Of course it is. Otherwise why is the national secularist society pushing this instead of some education board? Why is it being driven through the objections of a lone teacher rather then a horde of angry letters from concerned parents?

This isn't America; religious groups who seriously care about creationism are few and far between. I know Dawkins and his fellows have sold an awful lot of books that side of the pond by picking shouting matches with those nutcases, but when secularists carry on about it in the UK it just sounds like self-vindication.

–noun, plural -gies.
1.
the body of doctrine, myth, belief, etc., that guides an individual, social movement, institution, class, or large group. 

Do you really believe that it is an ideology to feel that religious beliefs should not be misrepresented as scientific knowledge?

&gt;through the objections of a lone teacher rather then a horde of angry letters from concerned parents?

I was in fact a [parent](http://bcseweb.blogspot.com/p/creationism-in-schools-isnt-science.html) rather than a teacher that brought this to light in this case.

&gt;Until this becomes a real problem in our schools 

The worrying issue is that

&gt;The school is adamant it has done nothing wrong despite presenting creationism **on equal terms** with modern science to sixteen year olds.  

From personal experience there are many well educated people/parents (some to PhD level) that can't tell the difference between some of the claims of creationists &amp; valid science (they don't tend to start with the more obvious stuff).

Plus the techniques being employed can be extremely deceptive. For instance this [book](http://www.exploreevolution.co.uk/) that has been sent out to schools &amp; libraries around the UK. It looks like a authentic science text book &amp; all the council libraries in my area have them in the science section. ([pdf](http://www.bcseweb.org.uk/images%20for%20blog/EE%20Exposed.pdf) explaining the scientific misrepresentations).

The point is that we don't want to wait until we have a situation like that in the US, we want to ensure that it never becomes anything like that bad. Keeping things in check by making the wording clearer in the educational guidelines is a small change, but an important one. At the very least it will make people more aware that it can even be an issue (which obvious you weren't aware of before).

Okay, I've seen the video a few times since then on my computer.  And the file size is always consistent with video of that length of time.  Back on my old 286, an extra 4 seconds of video would have bumped the file size up to a point that I would have had to notice.

That sums it up nicely. A three-year old article (I actually vague remember) of which the source of the resurgence is 'its believers and its critics.' There's even a quote from Richard Dawkins warning of the insidious nature of it all.

Why does it matter to you so much what these people believe? Them saying its science doesn't make it science; a kid who writes 'God did it' on a biology exam isn't going to get very far in life. Can you even explain what's so terrible about parents raising their kids to believe in creationism? People can believe they are created by fairies for all I care; its a free country.

It's a battle of ideologies; new-rationalists vs. theologians, or how ever you want to label it. And these people need their villains, their opponents, because it gives them someone to fight about. It helps them galvanise their supporters and rally attention from the media. People love fighting for causes, no matter if they mean anything or not.

It wasn't exactly easy/clean, I substituted apricot jam for honey because I didn't have any. (I tried strawberry jam, but of course you could see that through the cornflakes). I also used plain cornflakes, instead of Frosties which have a sugar coating - mostly because I thought it would be sweet enough already, also, I don't eat Frosties normally.

I made a couple of mistakes at first - my madeira sponge could have been firmer (just to make it easier and with less breakages), so the fish fingers had to be quite oversized. I also forgot to heat the honey initially, once I remembered, things went smoother. I tried spreading the honey, but in the end, it was easier dunking. :D

Whatever you do, you mustn't learn about this episode.  Don't watch it.  Don't read spoilers.  Don't accidentally catch a few moments of it while flipping channels.  Even the slightest exposure is too much.  

This was the most divisive episode in the history of /r/doctorwho.  Some loved it so much they declared the show could never top this and it would be pointless to sully their eyes with anything inferior ever again.  Still others made plans to march on the DW production office demanding that Steven Moffat find some way to return the 45 minutes they just wasted.  A flame war erupted between the two factions.  Those of us who hadn't seen the episode because it hadn't been uploaded yet could only watch in horror from a distance as the madness spread across the Internet.  A fan who declared ""the episode was just alright"" was torn limb from limb by two angry mobs.  Servers collapsed under the strain of 16,000 posts per minute.  As admins tried to find out what was causing the problem, they were exposed to the virulent meme and joined one side or the other.  

Now society has collapsed all over the world and we have one last chance to send this post backward through time.  I've just had to shoot two other fans before they could reach me with the madness-inducing spoilers.

I tend agree with a lot of them. I live in area where a lot of kids could be considered to be living in poverty as the west determines poverty and they normally all have parents who smoke, drink, drug and are housed and paid benefits to keep them going. Sure its no ideal life - but they get on with it and have no intention of taking a different path. I feel bad for the kids as they made no choice and unless they are strong and determined enough to pull themselves out of it most will default to that mode. 

However that is no excuse and its not a trap and giving these people more money, better facilities etc etc won't make any difference to how they live and approach life, unless they want that change.

I am no different to them in that we were brought up in same area. I was raised in a single parent family with a mum who worked all day when we were at school and then did peoples ironing all evening until she went to bed. She was constantly going on about her 'feet' and being 'knackered' all the time, but thanks to her being hard working and frugle we had a clean nice home and we ate and had all we needed (food clothes and shelter and love and discipline).

Subsequently I now work myself - I work hard. I have a wife and child who are dependent on me and no one else, if I fuck up they suffer as a result. I don't recieve any help yet I see a big slice of what I earn get siphoned away by umpteen taxes (and taxes of taxes). 


Yet meanwhile I have neighbours who have no intention of working and like some say in the article - they have all the trappings such as sky TV, an IPhone, clothes - things that would make place them as wealthy and fortunate considering most of the world try to get by on a dollar a day.

I find it hard to understand why you would not want to support that.

&gt;the source of the resurgence is 'its believers and its critics.'

Can't that be said for almost anything...everyone in the middle either doesn't know anything about it or doesn't care...if they make any kind of decision one way or another they instantly become a believer/critic?

I believe I said this before...I have no problem with people believing this &amp; telling others about it &amp; from what I have found neither does anyone else that have signed the petition.

&gt;Them saying its science doesn't make it science; a kid who writes 'God did it' on a biology exam isn't going to get very far in life. Can you even explain what's so terrible.

The reason it's so terrible is because it effects someones entire view on science. If you think that you can pick &amp; chose what 'science' is good and bad it will effect everything you do. 

For instance if you don't believe in evolution would you support funding for drugs to combat drug resistant bacteria? 

If you don't believe in carbon dating techniques how does that effect you belief in the science behind global warming. You can see the evidence of what happens in the US.

Often scientific evidence appears appears counter-intuitive, if you already distrust the scientific method how will you respond? Science denial (which is what we are in the end looking at here) can be [dangerous](http://sciblogs.co.nz/misc-ience/2010/04/14/why-science-denial-is-so-very-dangerous/). Just look at the vaccination scares..don't trust scientists! Get a [homeopathic vaccine](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-11277990) instead.

Useful [article](http://www.csicop.org/si/show/science_and_antiscience_in_america_emwhy_it_matters_em/) on why anti-science matters.

You may think that proponents of of creationism don't get far in life, but I would count being an MP as getting far &amp; there are a few MPs that openly support it (e.g. [Eileen Baxendale](http://skeptical-voter.org/wiki/index.php?title=Eileen_Baxendale) MP &amp; [David Simpson](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Simpson_%28UK_politician%29) MP).

&gt;if we learn any lesson from what's happened in America its the danger of letting these extremes pick fights with each other and dominate the narrative of any discussion.

Are you actually trying to say that somehow scientists &amp; 'rationalists' have somehow created the religious &amp; anti-science movements?

From what I seem to understand from your comments you main belief is that 1. there is no problem 2. Where there is a problem it doesn't matter if a few children are given the wrong ideas 3. It's just a load of whining scientists wanting to start a controversy about nothing?

In a way I hope you're right (maybe bar 2, as all children have the right to a good education).

""Curse of the Black Spot"" is the perfect example: he observes the scenario, attempts to quantify the evidence, and uses the evidence to come to a conclusion, and with each new piece of evidence which is found, the theories and conclusions change.

There are plenty of series which do this, particularly noteworthy are Warehouse 13, Eureka, SG-1, X-files, and Star Trek (TNG).  All of these series use science which does not (yet) exist, and may not even be based on current science, or (in the case of Warehouse 13 and occasionally X-Files) may defy science outright, however, the worlds in which they exist still contain rules regarding the nature of their world.  This, in and of itself is a form of science, as is their approach to problem solving.

Kays Bar on Jamaica Lane is a really nice, small old style pub full of locals and tucked away from the hustle and bustle of Princes Street/George.
The Stockbridge restaurant in Stockbridge is really nice and worth a vist and is a nice part of town.
One of my personal favorites is First Coast on the start of Dalry Road. Not the 'nicest' area of town but this little gem serves great food and has won many awards.
For a nice lunch in an Edinburgh institution try Valvona &amp; Crolla on Elm Row, really 'quirky' place with a fine wine/cheese/delicatessen store at the front of the restaurant.

I really like Matt Smith in this role for the physicality and fluidity of motion he brings to the role. 

The 10th Doctor was like a bar of steel, flexible but strong and would smash you in the face if you tried to bend it too much.

The 11th Doctor is like a bowl of Jell-O. Bending and warping, shaking and quivering, he's so full of energy. I see him as the other half of Eccleson's 9th Doctor. If you recall, the 9th Doctor just [survived a time war](/spoiler) and was still recovering emotionally. Sometimes he was mad with glee and other times as sombre and dark as a funeral procession. Alternately aggressive and pacifist, he seemed to be two people in one person. 

Tenant as the 9th Doctor seemed to be showing the angst and sorrow. He would fight and make decisions, but each action seemed to cause him pain. (Also, all that bad stuff that happened to him, [like Rose being sent to another universe, Donna having to forget about him, finding out his twin killed someone in anger, etc.](/spoiler) saddened him to no end.)

When Smith came along, he was fresh, new, happy, and had less inhibitions. When he [tricked the Silence into ordering their own execution](/spoiler), he hardly seemed to pause while doing it. The Doctor seems to be healing from his emotional scarring.

Now, if we want to put the rise of photography as a fulcrum in the rise of Silence influence, we should look at fashion from before and after that time. If we set the dawn of photography as a permanent recording form, rather than just an experiment, we should probably go with the 1820s/30s. I have two images here, a painting from before and a lithograph from after that date.

[This](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Seriziat.jpg) is a portrait of Pierre Seriziat from 1795.

[This](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:F%C3%A9lix_Nadar_1820-1910_portraits_Eug%C3%A8ne_Delacroix.jpg) is a photograph of Eugene Delacroix from 1858.

He also took over after the next season, and his endings have been all wrapped up in wibbly wobbly and intricately related to the Doctor, rather than something he stumbles upon.

Finally I'm always a bit concerned with sticking primarly to an internet based source of listening. Laws can change at any time, leaving you up a creek if you don't have the music on your hard drive or in a disc. Internet radio in the US very nearly died a year or two ago when Congress was considering a law that would drastically increase the amount of money stations would be required to pay to broadcast.

You can repeat a single song indefinitely if you want. And Spotify isn't like an internet radio station at all, though not that I have listened to many of those. 

&gt;Plus you support the artist more by buying the cd than you do by subscribing to a digital streaming platform.

As I understand it under the current model artists get a mere pittance from each CD sold. Not sure how much they get from Spotify at the moment, but when it comes to support artists I'd rather give them the money directly than paying it to some middle men that take far more than their share. I have a couple of friends who are musicians, and one who does some producing on the side, so I have heard quite a lot of debate about this issue from their side. 

What I love about Spotify is that I can log on at home, or when visiting my parents, and all my music and playlists are just there. Though the Spotify database isn't complete so I still buy the occasional album. 

When it comes to alterations to the laws I suppose that is always an issue, though I do not feel concerned about it at all. If Spotify is closed, my subscription will be canceled and I will consider a new option of getting the music I want to listen to. When/if that happens I will see what options are available. Not point in worrying about it. My person belief in this matter is that online services delivering music, and other types of content, will continue to evolve, hopefully getting better. At some point, I am sure, a new service will come along that is better than Spotify and I will change my service provider accordingly.

&gt;Or a ghost in a school

&gt;They looked beneath the mask and what was inside?

&gt;The fucking janitor or the dude who runs the waterslide.

&gt;Throughout history

&gt;Every mystery

&gt;EVER solved has turned out to be

&gt;Not Magic.*

true,[deleted],null,null,"The infographic you linked is from April 13 2010, presumable the numbers are from an even earlier date. According to [this article](http://www.ballade.no/nmi.nsf/doc/art2011011911391428493018) (in Norwegian) Spotify went from 250.000 paying subscribers to 750.000 in 2010 (and they recent passed a million). 

And [this article on wired.co.uk](http://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2010-10/29/spotify-swedish-revenue) says the following:
&gt;Music Ally quotes Sony Music Sweden's director of digital sales, Jacob Herbst, who said: ""Looking at the past few months, it is the most revenues for artists and record companies… We already have several artists who receive 80 percent of their revenues from Spotify. An artist who draws in half a million kronor can get 200,000 to 300,000 from Spotify.""

Combined with the stats from iTunes, it is fairly obvious that people are willing to pay for an online music service if it offers a wide selection of music and ease of use. While there is probably no service, as of yet, that provides the artists themselves with an entirely fair portion of the profits, I do believe that we are moving towards a market were there will be far fewer steps between musicians and their fans. Hopefully this will reduce the number of people demanding their cut, and provide artists, fans, journalists, and others, with transparent and accessible statistics of sales, costs, and other relevant data.

I'm trying to point out that there are men who are fucking moronic bastards who would rape a woman because they saw a bra strap. These are men without self control and represent the minority of the male population. These are the men these women are protesting about.

These women are trying to raise this exact point. The issue of rape isn't cause by their clothes but by the lacking intelligence or sadistic nature of the men who would rape. This is an effort to get the legal systems to acknowledge that just because a woman is dressed like a slut, they are not asking for it.

Finally, my last point before was simply to make note that men are idiots and easily manipulated by women. While tantalising lingerie would not make most men discard their civility, those who lack the civility might. You'll never stop rape fully, as you will never stop idiocy or sadism.

&gt;The original SlutWalk came about because of an idiotic remark by a Canadian cop about there being fewer sexual assaults on campus if women stopped ""dressing like sluts"".

Right...so an idiotic remark by one policeman in Canada: is that really enough to warrant global protests? Of course it isn't. It's an excuse for people to jump on a bandwagon, to get an artificial feeling of doing something for the greater good, when in reality there is no fight.

Day of the Moon:  [Putting the Silence in the moon landing clip, so that the entire planet would get the post-hypnotic suggestion to attack the Silence.](/spoiler)

Blink:  [Engineering it so that the Angels are all trying to get into the TARDIS, then making the TARDIS disappear so the Angels are trapped looking at each other.](/spoiler)

Eleventh Hour:  [Setting up a big computer virus from a cell phone as a signal to the Atraxi, knowing they will trace it to its source and find Prisoner Zero there.](/spoiler)

These are all very clever, and the audience can completely understand why they're very clever.

I also think that the monsters work differently than how the article says they do.  I think the Silence work on the fear of the unknown.  As soon as you are done seeing them, you forget them.  The Silence become unknown and are up to who knows what kinds of scary things.  I believe the Weeping Angels work in a number of ways.  First off, they take the form of something that are generally seen as pure and good, angels.  The Weeping Angels break our sense of trust in things we thought we could trust unquestionably.  Secondly, the Angels are statues.  Of course, the Angels are also super fast and can kill you or zap you back into the past before you even know anything is awry.  This also creates fear because you have to keep your eyes on them if you see them.  Else, you will not last.  Have you ever tried not blinking?  It's very difficult.  Even while trying not to blink, you'll likely blink a few times.  The Weeping Angels are practically inevitable.

A little offtopic, but worth adding to this conversation, I think neither of the mentioned monsters are scary.  What I like about Doctor Who is that it gets me to question the mundane things I take for granted.  That guy tapping his fingers, is he brain washed?  Are we all being brainwashed?

I liked last week's better, despite recycling (for the third time!) the idea of a machine that blindly heals those who don't want to be healed.

But never mind: it takes all sorts, and it seems that this episode made a lot of people happy. 

And it's still miles better than the Russell T Davies era. 

EDITED: Lots of downvotes, but lots of interesting responses, so I've answered a few. It also occurs to me that there were things in the episode that I liked: the idea of the TARDIS archiving rooms is pretty cool. So is the notion of a planet full of wrecked TARDIS parts. Given the way cloned or severed Time Lord body parts behave, there's all sorts of things you could do with that and the various... bones? Limbs? If one cell of a Time Lord is worth invading a planet for, then a whole elephant's graveyard of them would be an incredible prize...

Unidentified Time Lord: “If you are receiving this message, please help me. Send a signal to the high council of Time Lords on Gallifrey. I am still alive, I don’t know where I am…”

---

“Yeah. No! But if it helps, yes.” -The Doctor sort of explaining the concept of travel to “outside of the universe.”

---

""Doctor, what is that?"" 

""Oh no, it's alright. It's an ood. Oods are good, love an Ood.""

---

“Thief? Where’s my thief? Thief!” -The TARDIS crying out for its significant other.

---

“It’s on the tip of my tongue. I’ve just had a new idea about kissing.” -The TARDIS comes upon the idea of French kissing accidentally.

 “Biting’s excellent, it’s like kissing only there’s a winner.”

---

The Doctor: ”What have I stolen?” 

Idris: “Me. Are you going to steal me? You have stolen me. You are stealing me. Oh. Tenses are difficult, aren’t they?”

---

The Doctor: I really don't know what to do. That's a new feeling. *slaps self*

---

The Doctor: “See that snake? The mark of the Corsair. Fantastic bloke. He had that snake as a tattoo in every regeneration. Didn’t feel like himself unless he had the tattoo. Or herself a couple of times.”

---

TARDIS: ""I am your most faithful companion, and yet I have never been one.""

---

TARDIS: I’m the TARDIS.

The Doctor: ""No, you’re not. You’re a bitey mad lady! The TARDIS is uppy-downy stuff in a big blue box.""

TARDIS: ”Yes, that’s me. A Type 40 TARDIS. I was already a museum piece when you were young. And the first time you touched my console, you said--” 

The Doctor: ”I said you were the most beautiful thing I’d ever known.” 

TARDIS: ”And then you stole me… and I stole you.” 

The Doctor: ”I borrowed you.”

TARDIS: “Borrowing implies the eventual intention to return the thing that was taken. What makes you think I would ever give you back?” 

The Doctor: ""You’re the TARDIS. My TARDIS?""

TARDIS: ""My Doctor?""

---

TARDIS: ""I wanted to see the universe, so I stole a Timelord and ran away. You were the only one mad enough.""

---

Doctor: Sorry - do you have a name?

TARDIS: Seven hundred years, finally he asks!

Doctor: But what do I call you?

TARDIS: I think you call me… ‘Sexy’.

Doctor: Only when we’re alone!

TARDIS: We are alone!

Doctor: Oh… come on then, Sexy!

---

The Doctor: “I’m a madman with a box without a box. I’m stuck down the plughole at the end of the universe in a stupid old junkyard.”

---

The Doctor: ”Valley of half-eaten TARDISes. Are you thinking what I’m thinking?” 

TARDIS: ”I’m thinking all of my sisters are dead. That they were devoured and that we are looking at their corpses.” 

The Doctor: ”Sorry no, I wasn’t thinking that.” 

TARDIS: ”No, you were thinking you could build a working TARDIS console out of the broken remnants of a hundred different models. And you don’t care that it’s impossible.” 

The Doctor: ”It’s not impossible as long as we’re alive. Rory and Amy need me. So yeah, we’re going to build a TARDIS.”

---

“You’re like a nine-year-old trying to rebuild a motor bike in his bedroom. And you never read the instructions.” / “I always read the instructions!” / “There’s a sign on my front door. You have been walking past it for 700 years. What does it say?” / “That’s not instructions!” / “There’s instructions at the bottom. What does it say?” / “Pull to open.” / “Yes. And what do you do?” / ""I push.” / “Every single time. 700 years. Police box doors open out the way."" / “I think I have earned the right to open my front doors any way I want.” / “Your front doors? Have you any idea how childish that sounds?” / “You are not my mother.” / “And you are not my child.” / “You know, since we’re talking with mouths – not really an opportunity that comes along very often – I'd just wanna say, you know, *you* have never been very reliable.” / “And you have?” / “You didn’t always take me around to where I’ve wanted to go.” / “No, but I always took you where you needed to go.” -Whew! A man and his car have a conversation.

---

Doctor: ""She's my TARDIS. Except, she's a woman. She's a woman... and my TARDIS."" 

Amy: ""She's the TARDIS?!"" 

Doctor: ""... and she's a woman."" 

Amy: ""Did you wish *really* hard?"" 

Doctor: ""Shutup! It's not like that."" 

TARDIS: ""Hi, I'm 'Sexy'."" 

Doctor: ""Still shutup!""

---

House: ""Why should it matter to me in which room you die? I can kill you just as easily here as anywhere. Fear me, I've killed hudreds of Time Lords."" 

The Doctor: ”Fear *me*, I’ve killed all of them.”

---

TARDIS: “Big word. Sad word. Why is that word so sad? No. Will be sad.”

---

TARDIS: I’ve been looking for a word. A big, complicated word but so sad. I’ve found it now. 

Doctor: What word?

TARDIS: ’Alive’. I’m alive.

Doctor: ‘Alive’ isn’t sad.

TARDIS: It’s sad when it’s over. I’ll always be here. But this is when we talked. And now, even that has come to an end. There’s something I didn’t get to say to you.

Doctor: ‘Goodbye’?

TARDIS: No - I just wanted to say… ‘hello’. Hello, Doctor. It’s so very, very nice to meet you.

Doctor: Please. I don’t want you to… please.

TARDIS: (while re-generating) I love you.

-Idris saying goodbye, and the TARDIS getting a second chance at saying hello to its thief.

---

“Bunk beds are cool. A bed with a ladder. You can’t beat that.” -The Doctor, after the Ponds get the opportunity to request a new bedroom.

---

The Only Water in the Forest is a River.

First, seriously, how many times does Rory need to die? We don't need a Kenny in Doctor Who. It cheapens the show to have recurring cheap gags.

Also, the TARDIS line that humans were bigger on the inside. I see the attempted humor, but it makes no sense in context. Humans do not occupy more space internally than they do externally, which is a marked difference between the TARDIS and a human. I believe it would have been more logical for the TARDIS to be surprised that anything is not as relative dimensionally as it is, if anything.

I, in general, didn't really like the characterization of the ""Sexy"" character, because it didn't feel like it had the sort of nature the TARDIS would. As the Doctor has mentioned, this is a very old, very patient, and very sentient/wise creature. It would be relatively uncharacteristic for it to come out hyper and giddy. It felt sort of like an overacted 10th Doctor to me.

The TARDIS would have a very different mind from a human. It experiences the world in a very different way. It is much older, and doesn't possess the sensory inputs that we do. This would be similar to putting a monkfish in the body of a human. The creature would lack any way to relate to those that had always been in the form that is not natural to it, because it hasn't experienced the world in that format. All of its experiences would be foreign to it, and its prior ones foreign to us.

If I recall correctly, the TARDIS (as ""Sexy"") mentions that it exists in all places and all times simultaneously. If that recollection is correct, then he has torn apart the premise of the ending of Series 5. The doctor wouldn't need to shine the light through the crack, just through the TARDIS.

It reminds me of Islam and how they want their women to be covered to protect man's honour....  It seems that just seeing a woman can render a man temporarily insane or something.

Ashley Young? He's pretty good. Decent return in terms of goals and assists, not fantastic but good for a winger. I'd still rate Aaron Lennon ahead of him, I think he's faster but to be honest they're both pretty fast wide players, something we haven't had for a few years so they'd be a welcome addition to the side. 

Young is nice because he's been playing basically as a second striker but is a natural winger, so if we play a 4-3-3 or 4-4-2 he can fit into either formation, and we would finally have a legitimate right winger. I think he or any similar type of player would be effective in Chelsea, because he has experience as a striker it might actually make him pretty lethal, being able to cut into the middle playing in one of the wide roles of the 4-3-3 or being able to cut out wide and cross in. Makes him unpredictable and could trouble a lot of defenses. I think Sturridge is the same, although he's less of a wide player. But so is Anelka and he's done well ina 4-3-3, so I don't doubt Sturridge will be a revelation next season.

That said, it appears Liverpool and United are closer to signing Young than us. I think signing a wide player should be a high priority this summer, along with the possible changing of players at right back, and maybe even two midfielders (one defensive minded ie Jack Rodwell, one creative ie Kaka?).",0,1305438332,null,0,false,0,c1u50el,t3_hbljy,t1_c1u50el,t3_hbljy,1427148713,3,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,3

First: Unearthly Child (gotta start with the very beginning). You could honestly skip the Savages and go directly to the Daleks. Then you can shelve Hartnell now that you have a feel for him and come back later if you wish.

Second: Unfortunately, a good chunk of his run is nonexistent due to master tapes being wiped :( So, I'd go with Tomb of the Cybermen cause it's awesome and intact and isn't 10 parts like The War Games.

Third: Pertwee is best known for the UNIT days, so I'd suggest Terror of the Autons. First appearance of the Master, Jo Grant's introduction as well. Solid story though it shows its age.

Fourth: Tom Baker was in the part for seven years so his eras have sub-eras. So, I'll go with Robots of Death which is a pretty solid example of the classic series in the ""golden age"".

Fifth: Though it has a *terrible* prop/effect at the end, Kinda is an excellent story and is a solid example of Davison's era that *isn't* Caves of Androzani which everyone else will tell you to watch.

Six: Now we get to the beginning of the end for the classic series and a lot of people dislike Colin Baker. He's not really as bad as that in my opinion. I would go with either Attack of the Cybermen (sort of ties in with Tomb of the Cybermen from earlier and the TARDIS chameleon circuit works briefly) or Vengeance on Varos which has a better than average story for the times.

Seven: Gotta go with Ghost Light as it is one of the better episodes showing the strengths of the Doctor and Ace dynamic.

For one thing, I think it's an interesting angle because the show tends to focus a lot on how much Rory loves Amy, but the way it shows how much Amy loves Rory is a little subtler. . . This is possibly one of the most blatant examples. I think one of the other big ones is at the end of The Big Bang, when the very last thing the Doctor tells a young Amelia is to ""love Rory."" 

Edit: Also, I think it's probably hinting that Amy is suffering from some serious guilt over the whole 2000 years thing, and I'm willing to bet that's going to become something of a plot point later on. Anyways. I'll stop rambling. It was too good of an episode and I'm all giddy and thinky.

true,19O1,null,null,"oof. shoddy review, Steve. I won't shower the NuWho-niverse with endless praise either, but I can approach the show with enough of a love for science fiction and appreciation of the limits of television that I don't shit on other's attempts create their own vision of what Doctor Who can be. As you've attempted to steer r/Who to your site and I'm assuming, asked us to review your review, I will. My thoughts on your half assed criticisms: 

""Television, on the other hand is a more demanding mistress. There's no artist to fill the chinks in a writer's armour, and the use of real people and sets, rather than stylised drawings, gives it a literalism that demands a whole other mindset."" 

Steve, I must pause here and ask how familiar you are with the way television shows work. Do you earnestly believe that a writer is the be all end all for everything you see on screen? Do the concepts of budgeting and time restraints escape you? The fact that anything of quality ever appears onscreen should be of greater mystery to us all. Factor in the advent of laptop computers that are used while watching Doctor Who half-assedly and endless rolls of screen shots, and it's quite a blessing that the creators of the show put effort into fighting for the money to create sets that ""take us to new worlds"", in as much is possible when we're plopped on the sofa. 

""Can our hero catch up with him and restore the TARDIS' soul to its body before it's too late?

Of course he can - it'd be the end of the show if he didn't - but not before he gets to spend time with the woman the TARDIS has now become.""

Again, Steve, I find it frustrating that you raise this point as a critique when clearly, you seem to find fault with the very notion of serialized television. I will spell it out very plainly for you. Seasons, or in the UK, series, of a show are commissioned on a season by season basis. Typically there are between ten and twenty episodes. Very rarely does the main character of the show die off in the fourth episode. I can't think of any examples in which this is the case, and I'd love it if you could provide some to me. Therefore, even in the case of sci-fi adventure shows like Doctor Who, any viewer familiar with television shows might expect that the protagonist doesn't bite it, but does in fact survive and defeat the villain of the episode. If this bothers you, I suggest you stop watching shows and start watching movies, or write fan fiction versions of episodes that are insanely boring because the Doctor keeps getting killed before saving the day. 

""It's hard to know what to make of it. On first viewing, the thing's so inept in its story-telling that it feels like we've been TARDISed back to the grim days of Sylvester McCoy, while the actors playing Auntie and Uncle produce some of the worst acting you'll ever see on a TV screen. In fairness, as they're acting just like you expect Neil Gaiman characters to act, I suppose you have to absolve them of blame and assume they're simply doing what they've been told to.""

Again, I must ask if you're familiar with television. Perhaps you prefer radio serials? Menus of restaurants? Classifieds? You aren't grasping that television shows aren't simply plucked from the ether and beamed to a box in your home. Actors are absolutely told what to do, by a man named the Director. He directs them to do things. Furthermore, people don't simply walk off the street, they are cast in these roles. It's a bizarre process, one I doubt I could explain to a mind as feeble as yours. I'd also like to point out that these characters were clearly explained to be composed of re-animated corpses, so you'll excuse them acting a bit (pun intended) ""stiffly"". 

""For the viewer, the main concern has to be that, after a hugely promising debut, each episode of this current series has been weaker than the one before, and the trailer for next week's really doesn't look promising at all.""

Now I must ask if you've ever watched Doctor Who at all. Even in the classic series, there are what we fans affectionately refer to as ""dud"" episodes. For whatever reason, they don't work. Blame it on any number of factors that go into making an episode of TV (see above gripe with your gripe), but they never really ""sit well"" with fans. RTD's run on the show was chock full of them, and Moffat is certainly allowed his chance to throw a few ""whiffs"" in between plot heavy episodes. If you don't like it, wait until the series ends and google which episodes weren't plot centric. Why you'd want to do something so miserable sounding, I don't know, but it seems to be the only thing that could sate you. 

finally, this: 

""The Doctor found his way back to our universe but can the show find its way back to where it needs to be? Or was my feeling that I'd been transported back to the late 1980s disturbingly apt?""

You're bringing the 80's into this? Absurd. At best, the ""bad"" episodes of the late 80's can be described as ""unwatchable"". Current Who is, at worst, ""entertaining and fun"". If you don't like it, enjoy your VHS copies of your favorite Tom Baker serials and stop harping on fans that appreciate something you've grown too cold and bitter to love.

Second, i think it was blatantly obvious that Idris/Tardis wasn't talking about the physical space inside a human, its a bit ridiculous that you didn't get that! The reason the Tardis was as you say ""hyper or giddy"" was that 1) she was panicky after being ripped out of her home and 2) as a being that exists over all of space and time, being trapped in a human body and forced to experience space and time in such a limited way screwed with her sense of everything. Notice how at the start of the ep, what seemed like her spouting nonsense was actually just her being able to see into the near future and to what she would say later on in the ep. So, yea, the Tardis would (and does) experience things differently, as you mentioned in your forth point, but that explains her characterization that you had trouble with in your third point. 

And your fifth point, as someone has already pointed out, is exactly what happened in the fifth series conclusion. The doctor DID shine the light through the Tardis (which made the cracks) because the Tardis was existing/exploding in all places and times simultaneously.

Lastly, and sorry for the tirade, but the whole episode was about the relationship between the Doctor and the Tardis. An idea that afaik has not been dealt with before.. and an idea which I believe was handled beautifully! If you took the Tardis out of that premise, you wouldn't have an episode. Even if you replaced the Tardis with Romana, it wouldn't nearly have had as much significance as this ep did. Theres a lot to be said about continuity and respecting the so called canon, but with Who, isn't the aim to be as new and original as possible? The possibilities are endless, so why swap out a fantastic idea such as this one for an old character only for way of ""homage"" (and an unoriginal, ham-fisted one at that) that adds nothing new or exciting to the mythos?

The language you use is kinda  disparaging towards the women involved in this walk; you undermine their motives, passion and energy by labelling them as ""whiny,"" ""attention-seeking,"" ""look-at-me bullshit."" 

Would you use that kind of language if the protesters had been male, maybe black men protesting the common image of them as ""threats"" at night? Or Sikh men protesting the slur ""towel-head?"" It is a common tactic to dismiss women's protests and voices by labelling them ""whiny,"" or ""bitchy"" or ""nagging,"" but it's a very cheap trick. 

Secondly, you dismiss outright the notion that one public official's comment somewhere could possibly be important enough to ""warrant"" global protests. Well, it obviously was! The protests took place. People were shocked and angered and frustrated, and it drove them to action - isn't this the case with many protests the world over? They took to protest because the comment reflected an assumption that badly needs to be challenged - that the rape victim is at all to blame for what s/he wore. They were also reclaiming a word, much like ""queer"" has been reclaimed by the gay community. 

Would you be making these sorts of comments if this had been a ""fag-walk,"" or a ""nigger-walk?"" It's important for long-oppressed groups in society to stand up for themselves and make their voices heard, no matter if they're female or religious or disabled or black, and no matter if you think their cause is pathetic.

Just because something happened, it doesn't mean that it was necessary or justified. By that logic you could argue for almost anything.

I still think that it's completely overblown. Maybe I should clarify though - I have no issue with the original protest in Toronto. It may have just been a lowly police official who made those comments, but it was THEIR lowly police official. My remarks are mostly aimed towards the copycat protests.

&gt;Would you be making these sorts of comments if this had been a ""fag-walk,"" or a ""nigger-walk?""

If these too were copycat protests in relation to an opinion held by some little policeman in another country, then yes. These words did not come from on high; they are not enshrined in any statute. This was not even the opinion of the police force, as some people attempt to make out. They came from one guy who is now more than likely fired.

&gt;They were also reclaiming a word

Hardly. Even though the word 'slut' is a pejorative usually directed towards women, it's not exclusively used by men - women will use that word to disparage other women. In fact I don't think they were even trying to 'reclaim' the word as you put it.

&gt;no matter if you think their cause is pathetic

Their cause isn't pathetic, it's just that it's been done already - that's why ""she was dressed like a slut"" isn't a legal defence, or even looked at as an 'excuse'.

&gt;They took to protest because the comment reflected an assumption that badly needs to be challenged - that the rape victim is at all to blame for what s/he wore.

Who thinks this way? Even gutter press tabloid hacks don't espouse this view; you'd really have to be scraping the bottom of the barrel these days to dig up anyone who sincerely holds that opinion. There is no fight here.

This protest is a one without an aim. What would be their ideal outcome of all this? So I say again:

Wasn't there actually allegations of bribes by to FIFA officials to fix the result?  http://uk.eurosport.yahoo.com/13052011/63/qatar-fixer-worked-fifa.html for example. Russia isn't exactly a country known for being free of corruption, either.

I know England wasn't competing with Qatar, but it says a lot when FIFA decided to bring the World Cup to a country with little football history, a unsuitable climate and no infrastructure - Qatar promised all these portable stadia with irrigation, air conditioning etc. 

Now it turns out that Qatar was promising the earth and can't deliver it - so FIFA wants to move the World Cup to a part of the year where temperatures aren't 34953475C. Why not just disqualify them and hold the competition in a country that has the infrastructure and CAN hold the competition at the traditional type of year without the footballers and spectators dying of heat stroke?

&gt;Opponents of the flat tax, on the other hand, claim that since the marginal value of income declines with the amount of income (the last $100 of income of a family living near poverty being considerably more valuable than the last $100 of income of a millionaire), taxing that last $100 of income the same amount despite vast differences in the marginal value of money is unfair.

So should we tax as we do now? ~20% for the low earners, and 40%+ for earners of x amount of money (set by whom?), because that doesn't seem to be working so well.

In the UK we have a far larger population, and a far more diverse distribution of wealth and socio-economic status.

The current tax system allows you to earn up to £7475 without paying a penny, the next £35K you earn is taxed at 20%, and anything over that amount up to £150K is taxed at 40%, but if you earn over £100K you lose the tax free £7K allowance. Anything over £150K is taxed at 50%. 

The problem with the tax code is not that poor people aren't paying enough, it is that wealthy people have both the ability and the opportunity to reduce their tax obligations by  exploiting the tax code to their advantage. For example, if you have to drive 30mins to your minimum wage job, you cannot claim that back as tax relief because you are traveling to your place of work. If you are a marketing exec, you can have your HR department classify you as a home worker, which will entitle you to claim any travel to your office back as tax relief because it is a business expense.

[Proven lie](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McCrone_report). And you wonder how we feel this way?

Besides that, I suggest you research how Scotland fared last time under the Tories. They have no votes here, they know this and they've always know this. To say we have been treated ""significantly better"" sets new standards of ignorance. 

&gt; Allowing you to vote in English matters but not vice versa

In every situation this has come up it's been Scottish Labour MPs voting *on the order of the party leadership*.

SNP MPs always abstain from these votes. You are blaming the wrong people. The issue lies in Whitehall. 

&gt; allowing you free university education

Just because you were short-sighted enough to kill this don't believe for a minute that the rest of us want to follow you. Scotland was the first nation in Europe to provide free education for all and this is a tradition worth fighting for. You won't get an apology out of us on this one, not in a million years. There is a reason we've got more SI units named after our scientists than you do! :-)

&gt; gives Scottish people more money per head than anyone else in the UK

As I said, taking into account North Sea revenues put us at a significant disadvantage. There is a huge surplus of ours making its way into your pockets. The linked McCrone report above details this. Your politicians (Tory &amp; Labour) conspired together to spread this LIE that you believe. All of this is official and on paper as revealed by Freedom of Information Requests. I believe your MPs called it an ""embarrassing surplus"" in their report. 

Oil aside, Scotland's GDP is higher than anywhere in England with the exception of London itself. Edinburgh and Glasgow are significant financial centres, with the former being the forth largest in Europe. 

We are not the paupers you have been told we are. This attitude is the principle reason for the current nationalistic sentiment. Next time you wonder why some Scots want to go it alone, take a look in the mirror. 

&gt; I'm sure the Scots would find a way to blame the English for their problems.

true,UnoriginalGuy,welsh,Wales,"Justified.    

Good executives are rare. If the UK underpays them I'm sure they will just move to a more industrious country or company. The UK's level of income for executives is not unusual relative to the US or other Western countries. If the UK did change how pay was taxed or regulated, they would also just hide all of their income using offshore dummy companies and do more damage to the national debt than it would help.    

They also have a really hard job. They take significantly more risk than anyone else in the company. A wrong decision can literally end the company, and a right decision can pay the salary of 215 employees for a year or more.     

Executive bonuses have also taken a massive hit in the last three years as the profitability of the company decreases. Luckily they absorb this instead of passing it down to employees. Can you imagine if your pay suddenly dropped by 10-20%? Well that's what a CEO has to put up with when the company's income dries up. You still get paid, they just have to struggle through.    

Plus, research has shown that better pay and bouses results in better outcomes. Do you think if you underpay a CEO or CTO they're going to give you the best? No, of course not, since they will already be interviewing for a new job just like you or I would.      

Most of you pretend like you could be a CEO and that you would want to. But I bet the second you're given the chance and have everyone second guessing every last decision you make, and seeing a large chunk of your income being performance related (not guaranteed while you half-arse it) you would all make up excuses and shy away from the responsibility.    

To be honest, if anything executives aren't paid nearly enough for the hard and often thankless job they do. Bonuses should be rolled into real salary, and the tax code should be reformed to tax executives at the same rate as everyone else (""fair tax"").

Amy: What?

true,thecosmicpope,scot-Angus,Angus,"I don't hate England, I just hate the way you approach sports as a whole. England spends the entire build up telling you how amazing the team/player is, and how they are going to win. Then when they don't, nobody admits fault, they just shout and blame it on everything else. The tabloids just exaggerate the problem, but you can even see it on TV during the events. You guys are so incredibly self centred when it comes to sports, then you wonder why nobody else wants to support you.

During the opening game of the 1998 World Cup, Scotland was playing Brazil and it took less than 10 minutes for the English commentary team to talk about 1966. During a recent Rugby match between Scotland and Italy, there was a 1 hour build up, 45 minutes of which was talking about the England match later than evening, which itself had a 2 hour build up. 

As a motorsport fan, recent years have been unbearable for me. ITV spent the entire time saying how amazing Jenson Button was for being ENGLISH and shouting ""GET IN YOU BEAUTY"" when he won, and then it happened again when Lewis Hamilton came along. Nevermind any of the Scots in these things, let's just talk about how amazing the English are. But every so often a commentator will twig that they've been talking about England so much and interrupt themselves and call the driver British instead.

At Le Mans, Allan McNish is oftened referred to as a British driver, and amazingly, Eurosports commentators even claimed David Brabham, the man who was born and grew up in Australia, and races under an Australian license, as English. Seriously? Just because he said he doesn't like to have a nationality, and a Union Jack was beside his name on a Bentley once? 

I don't mind England. I go there quite a lot, and I have quite a few English mates who I like better than most Scottish people I know. But the English attitude when it comes to sports is a disgrace and I'll never support England in sports because of that. I won't slag you off if you win, I won't hate you if you're champions, but don't expect me to sit on the sidelines and cheer on you.

It turns out that for each episode on the BBC website, they have a section called ""The Fourth Dimension"" which houses little trivia tidbits for each episode. What boggled our minds though, is that there are some words, just words, that are in an Italic font, and the use of it was simply out of place. 
We decided to log each of these words, and, to our suprise, they formed a legible sentance. We decided to check over each episode and sure enough, there were the italic words again. We took the liberty of logging each of these so the readers of this don't have to, but naturally they will be spoiler tagged for consideration.

true,deroy,tardis,TARDIS,"I was wondering about that as well.  Assuming it isn't Rory, but House's projection of him then it leaves a lot to ponder.  First it's safe to say that House is fairly telepathic - as it's gleamed quite a lot from both Amy and Rory (fears and more importantly the fact that in an alternate universe/life Rory lived and waited for 2,000 years for Amy.)

Playing on this I see three options for what the statement may have meant.  The first is just an obvious shock statement - House has Rory say something that will terrify Amy (tortures at night - this seems both likely, as House is a sadist, and unlikely because as they are in the Tardis travelling through deep space the concept of day and night are a big lax - how does Rory know they come at night - and why at night?)  

The second idea I've had is that House has extracted this fact from Rory's subconscious - as Rory voices his anger and frustration at Amy he might have also confessed another secret he had been hiding - that something has been coming for him every night (possibly the Silence or some other baddie.)  But I'm less sure of this idea.

Finally - and based off of what mageqwerty said - if it is all in Amy's head perhaps House is voicing a fact in Amy's mind - that something had come to her at night and tortured her - I'm thinking about the time she spent trapped with the Silence.  It's possible that every time she was awake while stuck with them that she was in someway tortured (and then put to sleep - making her associate the time with night.)  A lot of people have been speculating that the Silence did something to her while she was held for many days.

true,crazylilting,welsh,Wales,"I think this is a bit different though, if you bare with me.  At the worst we have Congo, where rape is used as a weapon and in the UK 2009 we had 13,093 reported rapes and sexual assaults.  What makes these crimes especially worrying is the impact they have.  Having something stolen from you, as has happened to me, you feel violated and insecure, and if you are lucky you could have insurance to replace what was taken from you.  However With rape a victim can have long lasting even life long problems resulting from the attack.  It is also note worthy that many rapes have nothing to do with having sex and has everything to do with power and control over someone.  So when we look at the social impact of such crimes we are talking about the dehumanizing of a gender at an alarming rate.  If you imagine 12 or 13 thousand women a year alone in the uk that adds up quite quickly and the social impact could hardly be estimated.  

I do get your argument, but something is wrong with a society that does not stand up for real equality, not the sugar coated let the little woman have a job etc....  but pay them 20% less.  Women are treated like second class citizens at best and at worst beheaded for their dishonouring themselves and the family they belong to if they happen to be a Muslim woman.  

You take a survey of how many women feel safe all the time, you will find that number very low, why?  You take a survey of and find out how many women have been raped or sexually assaulted, or harassed and you will find that number very high.  Yet who pays the price for this crime and mind set in society?  Are men condemned for and restricted for this?  Or is it women who are warned on how to dress, where to walk and not to do it alone at certain times of the day etc?  How is this seen as fair and equitable?  You try and show me that this is shows a modern enlightened society with equality for the sexes.  

Also, if you think that black people are as free as white people you are completely blind.  They do pay a price for the high statistical involvement in crime.  They are not as free to roam as you think.  So they are being punished for being black, even if they have never committed a crime before.

The Bishop seems to know who the Doctor is (after being introduced), and once he is alone with River he says ""He doesn't know yet.""

To me, this means she probably doesn't kill the Doctor, because he is supposed to know about her terrible crime.  That's kind of difficult to do if you are dead.  I know a bunch of people are going to pop in with ""but he regenerates"".  Even if we assume that the beginning of TIA can be avoided/subverted, I still don't believe it's the Doctor she kills.  If it's something he could just regenerate out of, I can't see him holding too much of a grudge, especially if there is a good reason.  If he doesn't regenerate out of it, he's not there to ""know"" it happened.

I do feel that whoever she ends up killing will come across as a betrayal, otherwise she wouldn't be punishing herself by staying in jail.

I had to calculate something along these lines in a previous job I had. To get any sort of accurate answer there's lots of variables : how long is the commute, how fuel efficient is the vehicle, what's the SAP rating (energy efficiency) of the house, how many people (if any) would be home anyway, the external temperature on a given day and so on.

I don't have the figures any more but in summary the answer is that most of the time telecommuting is *much* greener. There are some edge cases of people who live in castles by themselves heated by solid fuel fires whose commute is normally less than half a mile, etc - but really these are a tiny minority. Even in homes with poor insulation and inefficient heating it's not clear that this would matter during the day for much of the year.

I actually agree with the protest and that there are serious problems in out society, but still restricting mens freedom for the actions of a few is unfair. Totally unfair.

The Congo has been a warzone for the past 20 years and is generally considered one of the worst places in the world, with no real courts or legal system and where strength is power. Very different from our country, where we do condemn rapists, very harshly. Look at the damage a false rape accusation can do to a man. Although I will accept that the pain felt by these men is barely comparable to the pain felt by a sexually assaulted women. Rapists are condemned in our society, they get jail sentences and are out on the sex offenders register, forever damaging life choices for them (justly.) 

In Britain we are working towards stopping 'honour' killings and trying to allow women more rights, not less. Judges are handing out harsher sentences for honour killings then normal murders. 

Although there is a serious problem still with sexism in our society, people are working on it. Most people do not accept the idea that provocative dress is a reason to rape and it is not an excuse in court. Sexism is on the decline and is going to stay on the decline, look back 50 years and you see a very different culture with far more sexism then today.

No they target women?  Why?  Where does the issue of power over women come from, and why is it so prevelent?  Why is there a rise in rape victims, instead of a steady decrease if perpetrators are being punished by jail and being put on the sex offenders list?

Meh. Forever is a long time - remember that Labour would have had a majority in 1997 &amp; 2001 even without the seats in Scotland (although not in 2005 I think). Having said that, Britain without Scotland would be more right wing overall I think - certainly for a while.

I can't see Scotland fully seceding though - instead there might be a demand for a more federal system of equal partners or something. The only way I can see full independence being attractive is if a massive new oil discovery is made in the North Sea (unlikely).

Not that any of this matters to me particularly. Although national governments may still hold the monopoly on the legitimate use of force it's fairly clear that an increasing swathe of social policy is highly constrained / dictated by supra-national agreements (i.e. the EU), capital markets or technological realities. So even if Scotland had full independence the level of taxation would be more or less the same as it's neighbours, as would its entitlement's, laws, etc. There'd be a few differences (as now, with tuition fees/prescription charges/etc) but hardly enough to get worked up about one way or the other. 

I suppose an independent Scotland would be more enthusiastic about fuller EU integration and would join the single currency before England (if it survives the current hilarity) but I'm not convinced that matters particularly either. Although there's plenty of smugness about the woes of Ireland/Greece and Portugal it doesn't seem that Britain is doing massively better than France/Italy or the Netherlands.",0,1305498030,null,0,true,0,c1u8ggr,t3_hbjyw,t1_c1u8ggr,t1_c1u5x6i,1427150334,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

""He never raised his voice. That was the worst thing - the fury of the Time Lord - and then we discovered why. Why this Doctor, who had fought with gods and demons, why he had run away from us and hidden. He was being kind. He wrapped my father in unbreakable chains forged in the heart of a dwarf star. He tricked my mother into the event horizon of a collapsing galaxy to be imprisoned there, forever. He still visits my sister, once a year, every year. I wonder if one day he might forgive her, but there she is. Can you see? He trapped her inside a mirror. Every mirror. If ever you look at your reflection and see something move behind you just for a second, that's her. That's always her. As for me, I was suspended in time and the Doctor put me to work standing over the fields of England, as their protector. We wanted to live forever. So the Doctor made sure we did.""

Carroll and Kuyt should not be playing together, simply because Kuyt shouldnt play on the right. He's not good enough technically, nor fast enough to be effective out there. He's a great up front or second striker. 

In my opinion, they should have just sat Carroll for the rest of the year, so that he can get his fitness back, and dont get overloaded with ppl racking down on him when it's probably because he doesnt have his feet yet.

It's funny, because my parents and grandparents watched this show back in the 60s, when it was first airing, and my mom watches the new series religiously. She was laughing that parents said the new series was ""too scary"", and she pointed out how dark the old series was.

When she was a kid (about the age of parents who said it's getting too violent/scary in the papers last week) she was scared shitless by the show, and said she used to watch the show literally hiding behind the bed, covering her eyes for a lot of the show. Particularly, the daleks and cybermen were really scary to little kids in those days.

I think the problem is people TODAY go watch the old series' and assume that kids back then reacted the same way kids now would. 

As for the Doctor, he's always been violent. He's just sort of self-righteous about it, and doesn't like to get his hands dirty.

Which is a squad of 21 players counting Walker as under 21. It's shipping out quite a few players but without that much football to be played we can't justify having a bigger squad. There are some players I'd like to keep but we're going to have to. 

The only issue is the CB position with 2 perma-crocks there which is why I'd suggest have 5 in the squad, although that's probably a position we should be looking at strengthening.

This is referred to in show as ""The Moment.""  Since the Time War was time locked, meaning no one could time travel in, out, or throughout the Time War, the Time Lords had no way of escaping The Moment.

Its mentioned here, http://www.londonbusinessforum.com/events/london_2012 
The traffic manipulation, admitted by Seb Coe himself, was hardly a secret as it caused massive problems on the outer edges of london for the rest of the day.

As for the world cup,regardless of the supposed bribe scandals, the English world cup bid received 2 votes out of 22 possible votes. No-one is seriously suggesting that it was more than a handful of individuals asking for favours, assuming it was four that would have got you six votes, Russia would still have won. Is it too hard to admit that you lost because your bid wasnt impressive enough, your media had also been attacking the fifa committee prior to the vote. You lost, you wasted millions trying to support a pretty rubbish bid, get over it. Better luck next time. Your sense of entitlement and your arrogant sense of superiority are your weakness. Its this attitude that means half arsed bids for events get knocked back, get out more,  look around, the world doesnt revolve around ""Great"" Britain any more, you have to make a proper effort, you dont deserve to win just by being British.

Oh btw as for this bribery stuff, its not as if that is alien to you cough BAE splutter ;) and manipulation of legal processes and government officials sorry hold on ""ah ahh aahhh aaaahhh coup"" I seem to have a slight ""sniff...ffff...atch-oo"" er....cold.

As for the qatar bid, personally I think its great that a new country gets to host the world cup, particularly in the middle east, its a good opportunity to build bridges. As for the heat stroke, everyone knows its only mad dogs and Englishmen who go out in the midday sun. It also seems they are not alone in having to change a few details after the bid was accepted...

The train was stopped for quite a while, about 10 minutes or so I think. An announcement came on saying that there had been a big electrical fault on the line and that no more trains were running. Everyone was asked to leave the station quickly.

I still needed to get somewhere so I went to the DLR (docklands light railway - part of the tube network that is mostly overground) and got on a train there. I managed to go a few stops before that train stopped as well. As we were overground someone got a message from their husband (who worked for TFL) telling them something was up - I don't think at this time they knew what though. Everyone got off that train and tried to get a bus but at this point they weren't stopping. This is about 30 minutes after the first bomb I think and at this point people were starting to know what was happening.

Fortunately I had my A-Z and walked back home across London. Besides the bombing that day stood out in my memory as being the only day in London when everyone was friendly and talking to each other.

A few other memories; the mobile phone network was down most of that day (presumably due to overloading), no-one really seemed scared where I was, the tube was really quiet when it re-opened but was back to usual pretty dam quickly oh and it all happened the day after London won the Olympics bid.",0,1305537914,null,0,false,0,c1ub5oo,t3_hce96,t1_c1ub5oo,t3_hce96,1427151672,5,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,5

I don't mind than England had a longer match build up - as you said, they have to cater for more people. But the Scotland match didn't even get one, because it was all about England. 

Pundits from other countries would help I imagine, but even without them, the better pundits and commentators tend to be able to counter act it themselves. When F1 was commentated on by James Allen, it was horrible because he was all about England. We now have Martin Brundle, and whilst he is still English, he is much more neutral when it comes to nationalities. It may help that they have a Scot alongside him in the booth (David Coulthard), but Brundle has always been good at this stuff.

true,almodozo,null,null,"Ah, ok, so you mean it's probably been the Serb population of Bosnia (in the Republika Srpska) that is responsible for any Bosnian votes for Serbia? Yeah, that makes kind of sense. Because for the rest of the population of Bosnia to be voting for Serbia would be pretty impressive after all that's happened (and the role that Serbia proper played in that).

And yet, I think that's partly what is actually happening too, and that it's not just because of the Republika Srpska inhabitants ... like, some things have become shared across all of ex-Yugoslavia again, in spite of the violent recent history, and music seems to be at the front of that. See for example the success of the [Western Balkans version of Star Academy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operacija_trijumf) in the countries of former Yugoslavia. 

In the context of Eurovision, for example, the ex-Yugoslav ""block vote"", so to say, doesn't seem to be explainable only by the presence of ethnic minorities. E.g. Serbia has not just received the most votes from Bosnia, it has also so far [given the most votes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbia_in_the_Eurovision_Song_Contest#Voting_history_.282007-2011.29) to Bosnia - and that has held true both in years when the Bosnian contestant was ethnically Bosniak/Croat or Serb. 

This year's Bosnian contestant, for example, Dino Merlin (real name: the very Muslim/Bosniak Edin Dervišhalidović), received 12 votes from Serbia, and from Macedonia too, despite there not being a large Bosniak minority in those countries (the Sandzhak Muslims make up only a few percentage points of Serbia's population). Bosnia's 2008 contestant, Elvir Laković, was born in Gorazde and served in the Bosnian army during the war - and still got 12 votes from Serbia. 

Vice versa, the second ranked country that's given Serbia most of its votes so far is Slovenia - not much of a Serbian minority there, but apparently the history of secession and (admittedly short) war doesn't stop the Slovenes from voting for Serbia. Montenegro, in its few years of participation, both gave and received the most votes from Bosnia, and received the second most votes from Macedonia. (I can't believe Wikipedia has statistics on all this, by the way :-)!). Slovenia has historically received the most votes from Croatia and Bosnia, while there aren't any Slovene minorities there. Macedonia has so far received the most votes from Croatia, Bosnia, Slovenia and Serbia, whereas the percentage that any Macedonian emigrants make up of those countries' population must be negligeable.

I would never have thought I'd spend so much time looking up the voting behaviour of Balkan countries in Eurovision. :-) Anyway, the conclusion seems to be that the block voting exists, irrespective of whether there are ethnic or migrant minorities to explain the vote, and even in the face of the countries in question having been on opposite sides in the wars of the 1990s.

true,[deleted],null,null,"This is a bit long, nothing special, probably typical, but you asked!

 I live on the edge of London (zone 6 ftw). I was on study leave for GCSEs, woke up after everyone had left the house. My dad had got a couple of papers for me to read about winning the Olympic 2012 bid which had happened the day before. Fetched breakfast, put on the TV for some background noise and went to read the paper but quickly stopped - BBC news is screaming ""breaking breaking explosions on the underground, major incident declared"". This must have been about 9 o'clock/9.30? They were talking about power failures or some fault at the time, not 100% as I was just transfixed in horror at the people filing out of the underground and was trying to gather where exactly in central this was and what was going on.

Then my nan phones ""DIZZY ARE YOU WATCHING THE TV?"" ""...Yes! What's going on Nan?"" ""EVERYBODY'S DEAAAAAADDDDDDDDDDD!!! HUNDREDS AND THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE ARE DEADDDDDDDD!!!"" So I immediately started bawling at this and tried to phone my mum in a panic who works around Waterloo (she gets a mainline train in and so I thought they would have been targeted too). She was fine and had only just got off the train, she was a little bit confused at my panic but it explained the delays on the trains. By now I've realised that my nan has grossly over-exaggerated like a numpty but I'm still upset. I text my sister at school and phone both sets of grandparents to let them know mum's okay. I call my dad, he's watching at work but he decides to send the office home because he knew the trains and roads would be absolutely manic later.

I think people have to realise that London has dealt with similar (albeit on a smallerish/less out-of-nowhere scale) in fairly recent years with the IRA. My Dad had a lucky escape in the early 90's; on his way to work in central he had to change trains at London Bridge. He went to the loo and just about made the train. As the train was leaving the station, an explosion went off in the bathroom he was just in.  All the package alerts meant closed stations. If Charing Cross was shut, my mum would just go down to Embankment and get the boat east to Greenwich and get buses home from there. Everyone just got used to it. So when speculation turned to terrorism my dad's first thought was that it was the IRA again. Although I, as someone more familiar with 9/11, thought it was al qaeda. The bus explosion confirmed it was terrorism rather than a fault on the tube and the image of that bus is pretty iconic. I have an article written the next day somewhere with that picture.

My mum went back to work immediately afterwards, although she'd noticed there were less people for around a week and everyone was more panicky about left luggage (some woman was screaming about a carrier bag until someone claimed it, and no one would sit near anyone who looked faintly middle-eastern). 

So **two weeks later** my parents decide to take me and my sister uptown to show us there's nothing to be afraid of - it's the summer holidays now and my parents booked the day off work to do it. We'd been planning to go for my sister's birthday on the 9th anyway but postponed it for obvious reasons. It was a good day, walking through central. Until we get to Aldwych and there's a reporter and a photographer on their phones, running along the street going ""we've gotta to get to Warren Street get to Warren Street!"" (I think they said Warren Street?). We start to hear helicopters and police sirens. My sister is oblivious, I'm noticing something but not putting 2 and 2 together, my parents say ""come on girls, let's get on this bus (old Routemaster) to Embankment and get the riverboat home!"". On the bus we go past Trafalgar Square. I see a police van disregard everything and cut a corner to avoid traffic and a light by running over one of the traffic islands without slowing down. My parents are now on critical alert; ""come on girls let's jump off the bus because jumping off Routemasters is fun and let's walk down Whitehall!"" 

We got the boat, it wasn't busy, had a lovely tour down the Thames and all the while there are tens of helicopters going around, sirens everywhere, all the way down the river. My parents remain silent on the issue until we get home, then my Mum says ""I kept hoping that they weren't on the boat"". Turns out there were some failed bombs that they tried to detonate a la 7/7.

**tl;dr**, basically confusion, and I was in central for 21/7 failed bombings, parents' experience working in London throughout IRA attacks meant my parents kept their cool. Not that exciting.

edit: and there's reports of suspect packages on the Mall/Northumberland Avenue at this very moment that could be Irish Republican dissident related, but that's on Twitter so take that with your RDA of salt.

&gt;WHEN A BOMB goes off in London, several groups or individuals may try to claim responsibility for the act to further their own cause. To weed out the fakes, the IRA has taken to giving law-enforcement officials and the news media a coded message. 

&gt;But how is a journalist supposed to know it's really the IRA?

&gt;The caller utters a recognized code, known to media and police. It confirms that the IRA is going to do something terrifying, or takes responsibility for something that's already happened.

&gt;There are calls with code words. And there are written pronouncements issued with pseudonyms, like P. O'Neil for the IRA, and Captain Black for the Protestant paramilitaries.

&gt;n the past the code often changed, although not recently. How would the media know the code had changed in the past? They would get a call with a new code saying something awful would happen, and if it happened, they would know the code had changed.

&gt;Mulholland remains shaken by a call made last Feb. 9, when the IRA contacted RTE 30 minutes before the 6 p.m. newscast to announce that a 17-month cease-fire was over. The caller provided the recognized code, but it had been so long since they had received such a call and the news was so important, they wanted to double-check.

&gt;Several minutes into the broadcast, the IRA contacted the network again, and asked why the announcement hadn't been aired.

&gt;""We tried to confirm it in other ways by calling people,"" Mulholland says. ""We waited until 5 minutes of 7, almost when our news program was coming off air, when one of our journalists said, `yeah, this is genuine.' ""

&gt;And genuine it was.

&gt;RTE went with the story. A few minutes later, a blast rocked a London business district, killing two, injuring scores and causing millions of dollars in damage.

&gt;""I had one of the most angst-ridden experiences in my time in broadcasting,"" Mulholland says. ""I was extremely conscious that if we were not to broadcast this and it were true, then we were going to come under severe criticism. If we were to broadcast it and it was untrue, we would not have lived down the ignominy of that. It was a difficult moment.""",0,1305549140,null,0,false,0,c1ubjhh,t3_hcgzs,t1_c1ubjhh,t1_c1ubhkp,1427151861,27,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,27

true,[deleted],null,null,"OK, I'm a bit clearer headed now. Bear with me, though as it's morning here. **Oh, LOTS OF SPOILERS AHEAD!**  
I like where you're heading with this idea. The universe was about to have never existed. And after the TARDIS exploded, most of it didn't. But then there's Amy Pond. We know something is up with her. She's an anomaly, and when the Doctor said that last season, I think he meant more than just an anomaly in time like himself.  
So, the TARDIS explodes and the Doctor gets locked up and Amy dies by her lover's hand, who, by the way, shouldn't even exist or ever exist (but he was quite a significant person for her, wasn't/isn't he?). Some timey-wimey stuff happens and the Doctor gets out and gets Amy into the Pandorica and lets her heal for 2000 years or so, with Rory the Roman (who shouldn't exist) by her side. But then the Doctor has to die to save the universe, which doesn't really exist at this point except for the Earth.  
So, now we have a universe that does exist, and Amy has Rory but there is no Doctor and never was (which is a whole other can of worms) (oh and there is also River Song). And now we get to the question at hand. Amy Pond, wonderful, mysterious Amy Pond, ""remember's"" the Doctor. How she does this, I don't quite understand, nor do I understand how River knew to give her the blank TARDIS diary to make Amy stop and remember. My theory, like yours is that since Amy remembered original Rory, she remembered the Doctor. And thus, he must exist. BUT, (and this is where I start asking questions) a dream can be remembered as well, can it not? Or a fantasy from youth (which can also be called a dream of sorts)? Like last season's ""Amy's Choice."" When Rory died the first time, I might add. I think I read someone else on this /r say that this all might be a dream. I sort of like that idea, though it will be a major mindfuck. But where does the dream begin? In which episode does it all start?  
Think about it though. In the last episode of series 5, right before the wedding, she wakes up, as if from a dream that she doesn't quite remember. Her mother, who hadn't existed for some strange reason she couldn't explain, walks in with breakfast. Then there is Rory, who doesn't remember. Yet. But he does eventually remember. Which kind of blows the dream theory apart. Sort of. He doesn't remember it all. His memory of his 2000 years with Amy in the Pandorica comes and goes. Like his life. And his child's existence inside of Amy. But what if, since she was able to bring the Doctor out of nothing and into being, from a memory of a dream (if we continue with the dream theory) then could she not then make it so that Rory was there with her in the dream? That he would remember parts of it? I would think that if she could bring the Doctor of all people, who's own history seems intact, and what a deep, thick history it is, then she could change the memory of someone so seemingly insignificant as Rory. But he's not as insignificant as we think. Maybe it's like what saintdog says below, and I'll quote them here:  
&gt;Or maybe he doesn't exist anymore. . . He did at one point, but after he died and was erased from the universe, he actually was erased. . . And although Amy supposedly brought him back, maybe it didn't work properly. . . Perhaps the universe is trying to get rid of him to fix itself, or maybe it just can't handle him when he's not really supposed to be there. . .  
  
Maybe this is true in a way. Though instead of not existing at all, Rory shouldn't be existing in his current altered state, having had his memory and history changed. But what of the Doctor then? Shouldn't he be having trouble existing as well? Well, he has died once so far this season, though a few hundred years in his future. Maybe since he is who he is, the universe is having a bit more trouble getting rid of him than it is with Rory. 
It'll probably be best explained by being wibbly wobbly timey wimey stuff, though, and I'll then be upset. Oh well. And if anyone else has already come up with this theory I'll be upset as well, though it was fun writing it all out.

People who come to the defence of Orange with things like, ""yeah but every mobile provider is the same"" have never been on 3 or Vodafone.  It's like saying, ""Hitler might have been a bit naughty with the Jews, but at least the trains ran on time"".  

Every now and then Orange let you make a phone call, but the rest of the time they just piss acid into your eyes, while telling you in a soft, Punjabi accent that they're ""working on the problem in your area"" and are ""sorry for your inconvenience"".

OK, I know, this is reddit, be specific, right?  Case in point.  EVERY SINGLE TIME I rang my ex-girlfrind it would first go straight to her voicemail, so I got stiffed with the 10p connection charge—even if I hung up before the ""Welcome to Orange answer phone..."" recording started to play.  If I immediately rang her back, it would connect and ring no problem.  We even tested it while she was sitting right next to me and I knew for a fact she wasn't on another call.  RIPPING OFF ORANGE SLAGS!  I told them about it numerous times.  Their response?  ""We have no-one else complaining about this problem, but we'll pass it on to our technical support team"".  LYING ORANGE KNOB WARTS.

Case two.  I was on the road a lot with a touring band I was in.  I had a Blackberry at the time.  All the other guys in the van were on either Vodafone or 3.  80% of the time they had full 3G network coverage.  70% of the time I had 'SOS Emergency Only' and NEVER repeat NEVER had full 3G coverage.  Not once.  This happened up and down the highways and byways of the UK.  From Scotland to London, Teesside to Cornwall.  The M6, A1, M62 and all major North to South, East to West routes and all major towns, cities and holiday resorts in between.

Case three.  My deal with Orange was for 1000 free text messages per-month.  On numerous occasions I began being charged 20p for every text I sent before the 1000 per-month limit had been reached.  I called India, several times, to explain to someone who couldn't speak English there was clearly a fault.  Without fail they ignored me and insisted their records showed I had used my monthly text allowance, when I knew for a fact I hadn't.  PUSS SLURPING ORANGE FART SNIFFERS.

I am now on 3.  I have an iPhone.  I get full or near enough 3G signal everywhere I go.  I pay £5 per month less than I did on Orange.  I get unlimited data and texts.  I get free personal hotspot tethering, 5000 voice minutes and almost instant free UK based phone support 24/7.

I hope Orange go bust and everyone who has the misfortune to have a job which involves lying to people on their behalf gets taken on by a better company.  The directors and management of Orange Mobile UK are corrupt, money sucking liars with a truly awful pseudo-network and zero interest in listening to what their customers want.

As for the challenge...I don't normally indulge such chicanery, and I have a lifelong rule against writing or reading fanfiction of any kind, however...this actually seems like a rather fun writing exercise.  I agree that some ground rules should be set, so here are my proposed rules.

1. A previously agreed to premise will be used as the skeletal framework for the episode, in order to level the playing field as much as possible and to help ensure that the writing is being judged.
2. The principle characters (the Doctor, Amy, and Rory) must all appear in the episode.
3. The format should be the same-standard narrative or screenplay format is up to you.
4. The story should be self-contained, and speculation about this series' story arc be kept to an absolute minimum, if not avoided altogether.
5. At some point, Rory must die.

He carries out the sin of omission to support his arguments.

When he describes the Prisoner's Dilemma he misses the understanding that the scientists come to. He blames the ideas on Nash's schizophrenia. The scientific explanation of why cooperation is widespread in prisoner's dilemma situations is because people will be playing the game again with other regular players. Its known as the iterated prisoner's dilemma. The secretaries at Rand know each other and will need to cooperate in the future. Its not a one off game for them so they cooperate.

If a viewer knows anything game theory they'll pick up he's missing this vital part of the explanation. It has been left out intentionally in order to mislead viewers. People may have objections to game theory and its view of the world but you have to be honest in depicting its arguments.

I was uncomfortable with his portrayal of Nash as a creepy mad man.

His interview technique to question people until they leave and then edit in the departure is dubious.

His questioning of Dawkins and evolutionary theory was fantastical. Evolutionary theory has not changed radically but advanced. He seems to confuse epigenetics with sentient life, he says ""scientists have shown that a cell actually chooses and edits which part of the DNA to use depending on the environmental forces acting on it"". He's using this to fight what he sees as a reductionist robot vision of humanity and in the process falling into the magic genie view of free will.

He replaces one dubious explanation of tribal violence for another questionable explanation of tribal violence.
This all makes me very suspicious of his earlier stories.

Though I still enjoy his films I look at them skeptically as just so tales.

The Century of the Self overplays the power of Freudian analysis to actually work and I think he underplays the conflict in the Power of Nightmares.

In The Brain of Morbius, the fourth Doctor speaks to the Sisterhood of the Flame on the subject of immortality and he tells them that the Time Lords were wise to limit their longevity to allow for change. In some other episode, the Master attempts to steal more regenerations, and later he is resurrected and promised them for his assistance in the Last great Time War. I feel like I am missing at least one episode where that was the Master's plan, and of course he wanted to steal the Doctor's lives in the 1996 movie with Paul McGann. With the Time Lords gone, and the need to continue producing an excellent and profitable show beyond its own internal limit fast approaching, I am sure the Doctor, of all people, will find a way to extend the limit so he can keep running around the cosmos and having his fun. In fact, if we go back to the third Doctor, there may be the first hint that he already has done once. In The Mind of Evil, he claims to have been a scientist for several thousand years. This is in contrast to the second Doctor's stated age of 450, and all evidence given afterwards. This slip could be tied in to the planned story arc for the seventh Doctor, which was to deal with who he was before he was the Doctor. There was a novel called Lungbarrow that summarized the unrealized ""[Cartmel Masterplan](http://tardis.wikia.com/wiki/Cartmel_Masterplan)"" which was to be told in the latter half of the seventh Doctor's tenure, although some hints were tossed in to the episodes that did get made.

I think that might be because when we think about a cold and inhuman character we think about a cold and inhuman human being (because we are human and humans are the only things like us that we have evolved to meet). Someone like that is actually a pretty memorable, pretty exciting sort of person (although not necessarily in a good way). And that excitement is not something I generally feel when I'm confronted with something characterless, as opposed to merely cold.

true,insllvn,null,null,"&gt; Is it just me, or does the way the dialogue trails off after that point seem sort of loaded?

it's just you. The dialogue trails off there because they are both very sad about that reality. The Doctor cannot always talk to the TARDIS like that, but both wish that he could. They are soul mates and constant companions, adventuring forever in time and space, but always separated by that barrier. They stole each other and ran away together. What exquisite joy and sublime sorrow!

&gt; The TARDIS greets the Doctor with ""Goodbye,"" and says her farewells with a ""Hello,"" the same as River someday will.

Now that, that *is* interesting. I think there are both differences and similarities between their respective relationships. The Doctor is in love with the River he is getting to know, who is also the River he helped her become, but also in love with the mystery of her. The Doctor has been loved by most, if not all, of his female (and at least one of his male) companions, but the mystery surrounding River is the first thing to really get his attention. I don't think their relationship would be what it is if they ha both met in the same direction, but the way things went it became a self fulfilling ontological paradox. The Doctor is falling in love with river because she keeps showing up and suggesting that they do, while she loves him because of the romance they've shared in her past. The Doctor loved Sexy Thing on sight and she chose him even before that. I love the contentment in the final scene of the Doctor's Wife, when Rory asks if the Doctor has a room an then Amy pulls him away so the Doctor and his wife can be alone, in their room. The console room is his, and he shares it with his one true love. The console room is theirs. 

&gt; I'm not suggesting that River's the TARDIS, but... when the cleric at the wreck of the Byzantium talks to River about the Doctor, he asks if the Doctor knows what she is, not who , and it's suggested he'd never help if he did.

It could just be he means the murderer thing. On the other hand, it basically proves the River isn't *his* TARDIS. Perhaps she came out of the Masters TARDIS, or the Rani's or someone else the Doctor would have a grudge against. Still, then you have the problem of the rate at which Sexy Thing was burning Idris out. She said it herself, she doesn't belong in a flesh body. I think it may have just been a nice touch put in to highlight the similarities between the Doctor's TARDIS wife and his flesh body wife. I wonder if Sexy Thing gets jealous of River?

Do you actually believe what they say? Especially from their sales dept. (3 are good, but their CS isn't great and certainly not always truthful).

&gt; Nothing in their sales material indicates they expect people to use less

It's a plan for your mobile phone - aimed at those who don't like the tiny data limits on the other networks. You can infer that it isn't really designed for those who want to replace their home internet connections with it - that is after all why they sell mobile broadband dongles and plans. 

&gt; and given the £1400 I've payed them over the past few years, it's exactly the kind of service I'd expect by now given a company investing most of its profits back into its network.

There's only so far you can go with the technology regardless of how much money they have (and TBH most of your £1400 is probably paying back the multi-billion pound 3G licence fee - thanks Gordon). They don't have that much 3G spectrum, although they are trying to make the most out of it with HSPA+ upgrades and such. If everyone did what you did I don't think their awesome network would remain awesome.

&gt; and nor does Three.

My initial theory was that the future Doctor's death would eradicate those events, as well as whatever event we haven't seen yet that the Doctor needed to tamper with his past to prevent, and fixed the resulting time loop by dying in the future- and that the person in the astronaut was either the present Doctor himself, or one of his companions' future selves.

As to where the TARDIS is: Prisoner Zero in ""The Eleventh Hour"" told the Doctor that both ""Silents will fall"" and ""The Doctor *in the TARDIS* doesn't know""- Maybe the Silents take control of it, become more powerful as a result, the future Doctor knows, the present Doctor doesn't, and that's why the future Doctor orchestrates that complicated plan?

But. Not *being* the TARDIS doesn't mean that she doesn't have an extraordinarily deep connection with it. Maybe that connection is something as mundane as a psychic bonding that takes place during a Gallifreyan wedding ceremony. (Note this is one of the very few subreddits where something like that can be considered mundane.) That would explain how she knows the Doctor's name, how she flies Ol' Sexy so well, and so on . . . 

In The Big Bang, a lot of noise is made by the Daleks about how only the Doctor can pilot the TARDIS. Classic fans know this isn't precisely true, that it requires a Time Lord's rapport with the machine; Romana was capable of flying it, as was the Master, but Adric, while he was skilled enough in mathematics to plot difficult courses, never could. Tennant claimed that the TARDIS was meant to be flown by six, and proceeded to let the Children of Time fly her, but then he had the Doctor Donna on board as well, and the pair of them sort of constantly coached everyone.

Yet River, he can just send her to pop the box over to the Pandorica site? Why did *he* think she could do that? (And to borrow some Rory, here, ""To be fair, the universe did explode."")

Just might be, the connection's not so mundane.

true,deroy,tardis,TARDIS,"I do think the statement that 'The only water in the forest is the river"" will play an important role later on in the series but I'm not so sure it has a solid connection to the episode and River Song.  I think it's a bit more simple than that.  Throughout 'The Doctor's Wife,' Idris, or the Tardis, kept referencing future occurrences/questions (e.g. the boxes will make you angry, petrichor is the scent of rain on dry earth) because she experiences/has a different understanding of time.  She tries to give the Doctor and his companions vital information but she doesn't give context - which is what makes her brilliant and interesting.  As in the story - the Tardis doesn't give you what you want/ask but she gives you what you *need*.

On the issue of Octavian asking the Doctor if he knows *what* River is - I think it's more of a veiled reference to the fact that River Song is a killer.  Octavian seems to have some understanding of the Doctor's dislike of violence and killing and uses this dark secret of River's as a threat to keep her in line - he seems to think that if the Doctor found out what River was/had done, he wouldn't be as willing to be of assistance.

I remember sitting in my maths lesson being told it was a power surge. For some reason my phone was still able to get internet service and make phone calls when most phones had been affected by the emergency services taking over the lines. Later that day in ICT our lesson consisted of just watching BBC news on the TV.

I saw as soon as the news changed to a terrorist attack through my phone and was made to read the article out infront of my class so everyone knew what was going on. I lent my phone out to a few people wanting to try and get hold of their parents who travelled into London for work.

It was also the last time I spoke to my dad to make sure he was alive seeing as none of us really knew what was going on. I still find it kinda sad when people ask when was the last time I spoke to him and my response is ""the day of the bombings"".

The stark contrast in the mood from the day before was also memorable. My school had held a special assembly so we could watch the Olympic announcement the day before and everyone was excited.

It had an impact on me for a while after. I was on the underground with my mum and I saw a man nervously looking around and just being a bit weird, with a rucksack.

Long story short, it turned out his computer refused to turn on.  It was fried.  Luckily we were able to put the episode on a Nokia N900, but we didn't want to watch it like that, and we couldn't get the TV-Out cable to work.  But we did have another camcorder.  So we set up a little tripod for the camcorder to watch the screen of the N900, and sent THAT to the TV, finally allowing us to watch!

For me the question is not whether he will fall, but how and when, followed by how (if?) he will rise again.  

Now back to your comment:  I don't see this so much as the Doctor outright killing this lifeform without though but more as the Doctor letting his longest companion take back what was rightfully hers from an invader that has shown no signs of compassion itself. 

And yet a third way to look at things:  The Doctor has never been able to avoid violence.  The Nestene, the Sontarans, Daleks, even the Time Lords themselves.  I think what has changed is that he's always given them until the very last moment to change their mind and draw back.  This season he seems a lot more resigned/tired, which goes along with what his older self said in TIA about how he's always been running.  It could well be that he's trying to run away from his own feeling of guilt over all the deaths that follow him.  Still, one could technically say that the Doctor DID give House a chance - He told it how to avoid destruction by getting rid of some of the rooms.  If House had not gone back on its word of not attempting to harm him and his companions then the failsafe would not have been triggered, they would not have ended back in the master control room, and Sexy would not have had the opportunity to wipe out House.  So we see a pattern of the Doctor switching from a modus operandi of actively attempting to stop the antagonists toward giving them just enough rope for them to hang themselves without him doing the legwork.

If House can only eat Tardises then he'll starve do death regardless of what the Doctor does. On the other hand if House can eat something else he is a being that purposely seeks out and kills Time Lords to eat their Tardis (a process that requires the sacrifice of another innocent), and is completely unrepentant about it.

true,[deleted],null,null,"There was nothing ""mutually beneficial"" about the relationship of House to his animated corpses. He kept them around as meat to hold the souls (or, if you prefer, 11 dimensional matrices) of TARDISes. He fed exclusively on Artron energy which comes exclusively from TARDISes and Time Lord technology, so to answer your other point, no, there was no other way of feeding him. They are dressed in ""1800s"" clothes because it's what they found lying around in the wreckage of TARDISes. Patchwork people made up of bits and pieces of Time Lords and other species unlucky enough to end up on his side of the rift and kept animated by him (notice how they laid down and DIED when he left?). How you could watch the same episode I did and missed these things eludes me.

To sum up, no, there was nothing redeeming going on in the wings with the puppet people, and there was no alternative non-destructive feeding grounds somewhere for the House to live on. 

Not sure what your next bit means about him not knowing the Time Lords were dead because by the time he gives the ""kill order"" (lols), he does indeed know this.

So, moving on to the end of the episode where you feel like the poor murderous parasitic space barnacle deserved some TLC from the ever-compassionate Doctor, who has *never* blown up a planet or destroyed entire space fleets, time looped entire races, or stretched time to make anyone age to death, *never*. Where is House going to be housed? (Reminder: House has left his mollusk shell planetoid body, which is dying without him in it,of his own free will.) Is there room for him in the TARDIS? Is there even some way for the TARDIS to cage him inside of its (sorry,, her) systems? It's not like House was trustworthy. 

And the Doctor was supposed to what at this point? Feel sorry for a *completely* self-serving untrustworthy barnacle from another universe and weep a bunch for him at the end? 

Oh, and the 10th Doctor didn't renounce the laws of noninterference. The First Doctor did that when he stole the TARDIS, the Second Doctor was put on trial for it. The Third was exiled for it, and the Doctor's bending and breaking of the laws of time has been an ever present slippery slope since the 1960s. Of course they're going to play with this concept some more, as it is a central theme. The Silence could well turn out to be an example of the Doctor taking down something he didn't understand, but this last episode wasn't. House was definitely evil and did abhorrent things, physically and mentally tortured Amy and Rory, and was blatantly dishonest and deserved what he got hands down.

true,[deleted],null,null,"What you have just quoted to me are the words of somebody who supports (or quite possibly works for) The Scottish Nationalist party. ""Professor Gavin McCrone"". I could search his name, and find out information about him to make the point of his lunacy more evident, but I don't need to. He's talking about a document that is nearly 40 YEARS OLD? LOL. On an article that was written 6years ago. Is this really the best Nationalist propaganda Scotland has? Or that you've saved in your favourites to show the English on reddit?

To be honest, I really don't follow finances of each country within the UK too closely, or even have correct numbers in my head. So, to make this simple I searched for numbers for Scotland GDP, to compare against Englands GDP. 

I came across [this](http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/scotland/article7022678.ece) article. Dated February of 2011. 

Apparently Scotland has just had a bail out for £470billion from the UK, that is worth three times Scotland's GDP.

To put this in perspective perfect, I can quote from it for you.
&gt; an independent Scotland would have faced financial “doomsday” if it had been forced to find funds of this magnitude, with the country's economy in meltdown as it struggled to prop up its banks. 

Now, I quote from you;

&gt; with us you are stronger. Without you we are even stronger

source for this? 

I'll tell you my friend, united we are stronger. Look at Greece, do you think they have the same level of university education that provides such world class economists that Cambridge or Oxford could provide? Negotiating inflation internationally is where a countries true strength lies, and to believe anything else is ignorant. As a united nation we hold much more power.

Who owns BP, by the way? Would you assume most of it's shareholders are English, or Scottish (or Welsh lol)? An independent Scotland, I'm assuming wouldn't use money with the queens head on it. So the rigs in other continents would provide no negotiating tool were inflation is concerned, for a Scottish dollar... or would they?

To vote for a Nationalist party looking at what cooperations you'd lose having your money attached to is something you need to think about. Installing democratic values in other countries is advantageous for The States and the UK because our companies can operate in them. 

Believing what people around you say about being against unification is absolutely bonkers. What happens if companies that are primarily English clamp down on Scotland, and operate at much lower rates? 

About that £470billion, by the way. I'm sure Northern Ireland and Wales would like to see some of it, should you become inderpendent.

 I disagree though that its the same level of detail. The other scene had the obvious wardrobe change, the out of place dialog. In this case we have a shack as background scenery and a shadow that might kind of look human shaped. The first was an in in-your-face weird moment where it was easy to make the connection while watching during the finale.

&gt;Their intervention could receive a sympathetic audience in Whitehall, where ministers and civil servants are trying to cut the numbers and cost of the prison population. The Justice Secretary, Ken Clarke, has already announced plans to help offenders kick drug habits rather than keeping them behind bars.

&gt;The former Labour government changed its mind repeatedly on the risks posed by cannabis use and was criticised for sacking its chief drug adviser, Prof David Nutt, when he claimed that ecstasy and LSD were less dangerous than alcohol.

&gt;[The chairman of the new group, Baroness Meacher – who is also chairman of an NHS trust – told The Daily Telegraph: “Criminalising drug users has been an expensive catastrophe for individuals and communities. ""We have the example of other countries to follow. The best is Portugal which has decriminalised drug use for 10 years. Portugal still has one of the lowest drug addiction rates in Europe, the trend of Young people's drug addiction is falling in Portugal against an upward trend in the surrounding countries, and the Portuguese prison population has fallen over time"". ](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/law-and-order/8393838/War-on-drugs-has-failed-say-former-heads-of-MI5-CPS-and-BBC.html)
