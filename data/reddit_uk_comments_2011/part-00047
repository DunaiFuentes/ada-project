I can't help but be reminded of a quote attributed to Frazier Hines (who played Jaime during the Troughton era): “You’re [Patrick Troughton] being paid to say [all the lines], Wendy [Padbury, playing Zoe] is being paid to get the dads in from the kitchen and I’m paid to keep the girls from doing their knitting!” If Tennant ""keeps the girls from doing their knitting,"" then great!

I mean, obviously if someone is watching for a certain actor instead of for the show as a whole, they're not going to get the big picture.

&gt;**The Color of Crime**

&gt;**Race, Crime, and Justice in America 
Second, Expanded Edition, 2005**


&gt;**Crime Rates**

&gt;Blacks are seven times more likely than people of other races to commit murder, and eight times more likely to commit robbery.

&gt;When blacks commit crimes of violence, they are nearly three times more likely than non-blacks to use a gun, and more than twice as likely to use a knife.

&gt;Hispanics commit violent crimes at roughly three times the white rate, and Asians commit violent crimes at about one quarter the white rate.

&gt;The single best indicator of violent crime levels in an area is the percentage of the population that is black and Hispanic.

&gt;**Interracial Crime**

&gt;Of the nearly 770,000 violent interracial crimes committed every year involving blacks and whites, blacks commit 85 percent and whites commit 15 percent.

&gt;Blacks commit more violent crime against whites than against blacks. Forty-five percent of their victims are white, 43 percent are black, and 10 percent are Hispanic. 

&gt;When whites commit violent crime, only three percent of their victims are black.

&gt;Blacks are an estimated 39 times more likely to commit a violent crime against a white than vice versa, and 136 times more likely to commit robbery.

&gt;Blacks are 2.25 times more likely to commit officially-designated hate crimes against whites than vice versa.

&gt;**Gangs**

&gt;Only 10 percent of youth gang members are white.

&gt;Hispanics are 19 times more likely than whites to be members of youth gangs. Blacks are 15 times more likely, and Asians are nine times more likely.

&gt;**Incarceration**

&gt;Between 1980 and 2003 the US incarceration rate more than tripled, from 139 to 482 per 100,000, and the number of prisoners increased from 320,000 to 1.39 million.

&gt;Blacks are seven times more likely to be in prison than whites. Hispanics are three times more likely.

Aw, you seem to have some grasp of rudimentary economics but then you go and make a pretty awful howler. ^_^

The question has an incorrect assumption, viz. that goods are priced calculated from the cost to produce them. Instead, goods are priced *at what the market will accept*.

As you suggest, in the case of captive markets (like the current train system) this is actually pretty high - despite strong complaints every time the prices rise, more and more people take the train. So, the train companies could--and will--raise prices even more. Additionally, there are no economic incentives to fix structural issues.

The banally predictable rallying cry in these comments are calls to re-nationalise the rail system (or trying to out-do each other in indignation olympics or conspiracy theories), but how about we avoid these intellectually lazy responses and discuss ways in which the current system could potentially be modified to increase the freedom of the market?",0,1313788516,null,0,false,0,c2dqvyv,t3_jnsgu,t1_c2dqvyv,t1_c2dnr8b,1427493836,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

true,essjay2009,cnty-wales,Bristol,"Unfortunately, insurance is going to be expensive for a good few years. Premiums have been going up by an average of 40% per year, so the premium doubling between your brother getting a policy and you getting a policy doesn't sound crazy. 

I work for a major insurance company and we've pretty much given up on young drivers because the risk is too great. Its a conscious decision because we would lose money on too many policies. Something else that you'll find is that adding your parents won't give you as big a discount as it used to. When I started driving I could put my father as the primary driver and myself as a named driver and it would half the cost. Most insurers realised this so now rate on the highest risk driver as the baseline - you might get it cheaper taking your parents off with some insurers. 

But here are a few tips you can use. Take a look at the money saving expert website and follow their guide to get the most out of the aggregators and follow their tips on reducing your risk and making yourself more attractive. Try speaking to a broker as they often get discounted rates that the aggregators don't (can be as much as 20%). Some insurers offer bonus accelerator schemes where you can earn a full year's NCB in 9 or 10 months -getting your NCB up is key. Another trick you can use is get yourself put on your parents policy as a named driver if they use a closed NCB provider (I.e where you get NCB on your own policy if you've been a named driver on another policy with the same company). This might be prohibitively expensive though. And a note on NCB, it's not just the discount that you'll get, that are very large, it also opens you up to products that people without NCB aren't offered. 

Two last things. There are still some car companies offering free insurance with a new car, if insurance for you is that expensive, this may be worth a shot (insurance on newer cars can be cheaper anyway, even though they are cheaper to replace). And lastly, almost all prices are negotiable, so negotiate. You might have better luck doing this through a broker because they can go to multiple underwriters.

If you imagine that each time through that process we lose money (not through the benefits drawbacks of each, but from the transformation), not all but a little. It's a tiny blip but relevant.

The next thing is that the way the licences are handed out is not in keeping with these companies making a profit. The ticket prices are set by the government, certain parts (such as tracks) belong to national rail yet the railway companies are somehow responsible for trains being late due to track faults. There's a shit ton of reasons in there why this is largely unworkable, but the long and short of it is that if a railway company director asks another 'will we make money or go under this year?' the only answer that can be provided is 'fucked if I know'. This happened to virgin trains, it happened to national express, it has happened to arriva and first great western too ISTR on a smaller scale (but I might be wrong on the last two, not being a regular traveller).

The way the rolling stock works is utter bollocks. It really is.

The simple reason that tickets cost so much is that the government largely sets the price rise rate according to a formula determined by the government. Stagecoach might be making money, but it won't necessarily all be from trains and it won't be 100% in charge of prices.",0,1313791725,null,0,false,0,c2dra5k,t3_jnsgu,t1_c2dra5k,t3_jnsgu,1427494022,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

But it wasn't a clean reset. They got in during the second big bang. This is why they weren't noticed the first ""runthrough"" of history before Big Bang Two, its why the only evidence we saw of them before this point was that crashed ship in The Tenant (which may be related to how they manipulated the Tardis).

The thing is, that without the perspective attained after having seen at least some of the other interpretations of how The Doctor can be played, they are more likely to reject any deviation from the Tennant/Davies paradigm that made them fall in love with the show in the first place.

History of DW!

What I heard is that originally, back in '63, everybody at the BBC hated Doctor Who. They were going to give the budget 4 episodes instead of the 13 (or around there) requested. They didn't want the Dalek story in there either, but didn't have another one on hand. After the Daleks came out then the budget (which was very high back then) was extended to 40 episodes.

The drama department, who had Doctor Who, didn't want it, successful or not and thought it should be in the kids department. The kids department hated it because it was successful and they *weren't* working on it. And to quote a friend of mine who seriously knows more about the history of the show than an encyclopedia: ""Outsiders hated it because some jumped up Canadian had created a hugely successful programme run by some young snippet in a skirt.

The coach fare is effectively subsided by everybody else's road tax, fuel duty and other taxation that goes towards the upkeep, regulation and expansion of the road network. Also, local bus fares and council tax pay for most bus stations and their staffing, with long-distance coach operators only paying a comission for ticket sales and a small fee to use the stop facilities.

South West Trains (the part of Stagecoach that sets the price for Southampton to London - there is a cheaper fare if you are prepared to travel on the slower route by Southern), recieve one of the smallest subsidies of any rail operator (1.6p per passenger mile) and thus have to cover nearly all their costs (and make profit) from the fares they charge.",0,1313827381,null,0,true,0,c2duseu,t3_jnsgu,t1_c2duseu,t1_c2dnr8b,1427495808,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

Eccleston was one of those Doctors who, like the Fifth Doctor, had a complete arc and whose regeneration was perfect (not the story - the ending two-parter was rather clumsy, but after he saves Rose to the moment he regenerates, it's brilliant).

If it is above the maximum, the government takes it. This is known as the ""cap and collar"" system and may well change in future.

""Network grant"" is a subsidy that covers some of the ""access charges"" paid to Network Rail. The operators do not keep any of it.

The two Stagecoach franchises, South West Trains (SWT) and East Midlands Trains (EMT) both received no revenue support during the 2010-11 period and in fact paid 5.2p and 1.7p per passenger mile respectively to the government.

Way to completely miss the point. The police shot first. (Duggan)

&gt; This is in Birmingham, you can bet it's completely unrelated to the Mark Duggan shooting.

Really now? Are you assuming that nobody heard the news?

&gt; Yes the shooting sparked the Tottenham riots, but the same cannot be said for the other riot locations. Birmingham rioting started on like the third night.

Is that the lie you need to believe to make your world make sense? Yes, I'm sure these riots were completely unrelated, no carry over whatsoever. Do you have any idea how naive that sounds?

&gt; So these people have themselves escalated the violence by shooting with some type of fire-arm and you're straight up going to turn it into a criticism of the police?!

No, what I am saying is that a continued escalation, as in evicting families, etc will lead to more escalations by the rioters. What is this, some kind of validation of the old two countries separated by a common language or are you intentionally misinterpreting what I'm saying?

&gt; I think that's the idea. The police are probably releasing these videos to show people what they sometimes have to deal with. 

And with all the video cameras in place I still haven't seen a video of the incident that triggered this stupidity. Any idea why that might be? One might assume that if the police acted properly they would be quite keen on showing the public what happened.

&gt; Also beyond the fire-arms, petrol bombs are pretty harsh.

Actually, that is exactly the point I am trying to drive home. If you think it's bad now, keep traveling down the road your officials want to take and see just how bad it can get.

Someone has to be the adults here and sit down to find out what caused (or what combination of actions are causing) people to want to burn their homes down. This is not how satisfied people live in society.

&gt; Oh, another chance to bash the police.

Actually, I am pointing out that this should be the top priority for the police right now (you may have overlooked that explicit wording in the post you are responding to). If you are taking that comment as a criticism of the police, then yes, I am criticizing them from the standpoint that if this incident is as serious as I dare say we all believe it to be - why haven't they found the guy? Are you trying to tell me that any number of the rioters don't know who was shooting? Is there any doubt in your mind that being released from prosecution and possibly being given a large reward wouldn't get the shooter identified? This would appear to be common sense to me.

&gt; It's their fault for the riots and being shot at and now they're not being quick enough to arrest those who were involved.

Let's take those accusations one at a time, shall we?

&gt; It's their fault for the riots...

I live more than 3,000 miles away and I know about police brutality in London - so it's not exactly something that's been kept quiet now, is it? The police shot someone (admittedly a really dangerous person) and somehow are perceived to not be coming clean with the public. Now (and let me be clear about this) I am not saying that the police did anything wrong, I honestly don't know - but I do know that the way this event was handled was less than satisfactorily and that appears to be causal in the riots.

&gt; being shot at

No, I think it's horrific that anyone would shoot at the police and I am not suggesting that it is acceptable. I will say that when people feel oppressed enough to start shooting at the police, maybe it might be time to find out if there is a reason and how it can be stopped. This isn't happening because some kid was bored - regardless of the crap I keep hearing trotted out.

&gt; now they're not being quick enough to arrest those who were involved.

This one I am certainly stating. There is no way that this guy (or guys) shouldn't be the only priority on the police’s list. Screw the damage to the stores, insurance will likely cover that - but one or more people willing to actually kill police officers is a far greater risk to everyone in the community, as that spokesperson clearly indicated.

The fact that the police knew this happened and haven't caught the guy (but have managed to catch 500+ other people certainly concerns me and it should you as well.

&gt; They seem to aim for a long time to shoot at nothing. 

I noticed that as well. But why would anyone do that? Seriously. if you pull a gun, you probably intend to use it. I find this to be completely out of character and when viewed in the light that the most dangerous people haven't been caught, I have to pause and reflect on that aspect of the incident.

&gt; Regardless of aim I'm pretty sure its illegal to own and fire a fire-arm in public like that, not to mention incredibly dangerous.

Absolutely.

&gt; Your whole post just is soaked in anti-police angst it's horrible.

Actually, you misread my intentions completely which may very well be the lack of clarity when anyone authors a written statement. At the same time, something is not quite right in this depending on which way you want to parse it down.

Let me also state for the record, I am not trying to absolve the rioters of blame, they took these actions and there needs to be repercussions for doing so. At the same time, I know that this is not something that hundreds of people just spontaneously decide to do so I still maintain that the underlying motivations need to be addressed. Further, if the aim is to ensure that peace and tranquility is returned and that this will not happen again, the reaction by the government must be measured and directed at that goal solely. This is not what I am seeing and I expect that instead of this being the event that created the necessary conditions to begin reconciliation, instead this may turn out to be the first shot in a period of history that will not be looked upon fondly as it unfolds.",0,1313840538,null,0,false,0,c2dvcn8,t3_joqok,t1_c2dvcn8,t1_c2dv86i,1427496072,-9,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,-9

true,randomrealitycheck,null,null,"&gt; this is not the school yard its time you grow up!

Speaking to that direct ad hominem, I would suggest that we shall see which of the two of us is perceived to be the more mature based on what is written here during this interchange.

&gt; the Duggan indecent we do not know the full details of, but what seem to be clear is that this is not some kind of execution that half the idiots bigged it up to be which was there FAKE justification for riots in the local area.

And I never implied that it was any such thing. I would appreciate ti if you would address the points that I actually made and not what you might like them to have been.

I clearly stated that it is my belief that the police could have *and should have* handled the public relations after the event better but that point seems to have escaped you.

&gt; its clear that he had a hand gun on him which depending on the situation could indicate that the police were full justified in their use of force.

It is my understanding that the handgun was found in a sock, which would indicate two things. First, he had not pulled out the handgun nor had threatened the police with it. Second, the police (in order to use deadly force) must have known that Duggan was armed and possibly could have arrested this guy under a completely different set of (and more favorable) circumstances. I would also like to point out that it is easy from me to say this, given that I do so in hindsight, but this is also indicative of how badly the incident was handled by the police press relations.

And I will add that this was at the least poorly planned and at best an attempted arrest that went badly. Either way there are lessons that should be learned from any such incident and I do not see them as being discussed as much as I feel they should.

&gt; but this is totally unrelated to other citys were rioting and criminality was carried out as they thought they could get away with it unchecked.

And you know this exactly how? In fact I would be very interested in anything you might wish to present that indicates what you are claiming, unless this is only your personal opinion, in which case we can then take that for what it is.

&gt; these videos show what can only be described at thoughtless attempted murder there is no justification for this as there was no local incidence or grievances

No, these video show a guy (or possible two different people) firing a gun at what you and I both agree seems to be nothing. No one was hit, no bullets have been recovered (that I am aware of) and one might speculate that this would be of significant importance to convict any asshole who fired a gun during a riot - even if he wasn't trying to hurt or kill anyone. More to the point, you are reacting as though I am supporting this lawbreaker and I am not in any way condoning this action.

One more point, you keep making the assertion that this riot had nothing to do with the previous ones. Why are you doing that? I am having difficulty understanding any of your logic which seems to be centered on this one premise. As it makes no sense to me, a lot of what your trying to say seems surrealistic. Would you please answer that question?

Having Andy up front is never a bad thing. I've said time and time before, he is lethal with his headers. He had a few good shots today off of headers that gave Arsenal some shaky knees. 

HOWEVER!!!...The team that was fielded after subs was obviously a much better team. With Downing, Suarez, Meireles, and Lucas, our fluid motion becomes a lot more observant. This is how teams like Barca play....a lot of fluid movement. Hence, why it works SO well against England AND the EPL. These are the people that belong in the starting squad. Andy can stay there up top, no problem. There have been more than a couple times where Andy has begged for the through pass that he deserves. 

Let's face it....if Raul goes, we would be shit. He is a class player and deserves Liverpool first team placement.

* Last minute production, last night.
* Slapped together with spare ~~space~~ wood I had kicking around. Saw, sand, wood glue, wood filler. 
* As I had to wait 25 minutes for the glue to set while assembling (in multiple stages), I watched ""Destiny Of The Daleks"". Rastafarian alien robots!
* Boba Fett came off the top of a Star Wars M&amp;M dispenser I bought at Toys 'R Us yesterday.
* The top light has a flashing white LED inside. The LED is housed in a translucent cap from a hairspray spritzer. The button to activate is on the back. Unfortunately it's only a momentary button, but it still works.
* Boba Fett and the battery pack (behind Boba Fett, see the red wires) for the light is held in with Velcro.
* The only paint I had available what tempera paint my kids use. Hardly thick or dark enough as is. I mixed blue and black, and added a dose of blue paste food colouring from my wife's kitchen stuff.
* Did the blue paint last night (around midnight). This morning, drilled holes, mounted light and cap, soldered wiring, velcroed Boba Feet, white paint for windows and Police Box.",0,1313851633,null,0,true,0,c2dvywj,t3_jouv6,t1_c2dvywj,t3_jouv6,1427496363,2,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,2

Of course it isn't and never should be.

&gt; Also imagine if someone at your work committed fraud and was caught. Should the rest of the employees then be arrested and charged for fraud as well?

But it's still okay to evict a family because of what their kid did, right? You are mentioning that point to me in relation to what is just, did I understand you correctly?

&gt; Now lets say the fraud happened at another branch over 100 miles away. I think you'd have reason to be upset.'

I most certainly  would and I would also consider it to be one hell of a coincidence, wouldn't you?

&gt; Nope not at all, I just believe the riots were continued in other areas for different reasons...

Damn, we must be talking across each other. 

I have already sad that there are a number of underlying factors that lead to these riots and that those motivations need to be addressed. Duggan was what we call here the trigger. As I mentioned earlier in this exchange, satisfied people don't burn their hometowns down. I am pretty sure you can see that all around you.

&gt; When the riots started I spent a fair amount of time keeping up to date with the news, twitter and reddit. I've read and watched a fair amount to make that judgement.

So, the riots were just a coincident? That's kind of pretty hard to believe, you realize.

&gt; which led me to believe you were ready to criticize the police for hypothetical harsher police tactics.

I am telling you exactly that.

Let's look at a somewhat similar time in history (and I am not raising this to get anyone upset) the IRA. Now before anyone tees off on me, I did not support the incredible carnage that these people caused and am not mentioning this for that purpose. I would like to remind everyone that what finally stopped the insanity was dialog, not using harsher tactics, even though that method was employed for quite a long time.

Does no one learn from the past and keep track of what really works?

&gt; Really? I obviously do not know as much as I should because this is news to me. Please do link me to a credible source that states there is footage of the shooting.

What I said was, ""...with all the video cameras in place"" which, in case you were unaware, *[Finland's closed-circuit television camera density relative to population is the highest in the world **bar Britain's**, regional daily Keskisuomalainen reported on Tuesday](www.helsinkitimes.org/htimes/domestic-news/general/1966-finnish-cctv-camera-density-second-only-to-britains-ks-.pdf).*

You have the highest density of video surveillance in the world and it wouldn't be hard to believe that there isn't video, in fact, it would be very curious of the police orchestrated a take down in a spot where the wasn't coverage.

&gt; It's still early days mate, give them some time. Two people have already been arrested and charged in connection with the shootings and it's said the police officers are determined to make more arrests.

I am relieved to hear that. I doubt there are very many people want these people on the street and those that do probably should be taken off the street anyway.

&gt; Also, ""possibly being given a large reward""! LOL!!

You do realize that rewards work brilliantly, right? I suppose that the size of the reward is directly proportional to how badly you want to arrest the guy.

&gt; Ignoring a debate on police brutality

Hmm, and where did I see that video talking about police brutality or making the claim that 333 people have died in police custody without a single person being prosecuted... I doubt there we all in Tottenham but I'm sure every kid knows that statistic.

&gt; Again for emphasis Two people have already been arrested and charged in connection with the shootings and it's said the police officers are determined to make more arrests.

But no arrests in the shootings? Even though two people are in custody who are suspected of being connected with the shootings? I'll look forward to hearing the news when it breaks.

&gt; Exactly. In the heat vision footage you can see the gun is being aimed at the police helicopter.

So it appears and a pistol is a damn poor weapon to try to hit something that is any distance away.

&gt; It's more likely that you mis-wrote your intention in this case I'm afraid.

Of course, it could only be my fault.

&gt; And don't worry I didn't think were trying to excuse the rioters, but you sure as hell seemed eager to criticize the police.

You know, I was brought up to look at all sides of every issue. I believe that the police did have a portion of the blame in starting this riot, be it a minor part. And here's the difference between us, as I see it, you seem to want all the blame to fall on the rioters and I'm can understand that - but without finding out what caused this, it isn't going to stop and it's going to get worse.

I would like to add that I hope I am wrong and that certainly has happened before. 

Good luck.

My solution to this would be, as BBC One and Two are becoming the first airing channels for a lot of arts shows now is create a separate entity called 'BBC Originals' that would be responsible for creating original programming for all four channels. Imagine what they could do with about about a billion geared not to catering towards a specific niche audience but focused behind creating quality original programming.

What is needed a shift from having to have specific channels for different people. All what this gets you is people assigning a label to the channel.

""In 2007, 19 of every 100 people who applied for asylum were recognised as refugees and given asylum.""

To be given asylum you have to come under the 1951 UN convention on refugees, which is not unique to the UK. http://www.ukba.homeoffice.gov.uk/asylum/claimingasylum/whocanclaim/

But if your previous employer is still responding to you, try and get him to provide you with something less than a P45/Payslip.

Having that in writing may be enough to convince the JSA guys to help you out, and then having JSA will provide proof for the other stuff.


When asking for this, remind the employer he's legally required to provide you with P45.

There are plenty of Britons equally well suited for the jobs, and they're not picked up.

Why? 

They either don't apply, seeing such jobs as a good many immigrants see fit to take as being ""beneath them"" (how many Britons do you see picking fruit for a living?), or they're beaten out in fair competition for the jobs by dint of the immigrants simply being prepared to work harder and *better*.

The other thing you can do is the pass plus. However having looked into that basically it knocks about 100 pounds off and costs £125ish to do, then in the second year the NCD gives a big enough discount that you wouldn't even notice. In the long run it would be helpful for you to do IAM/ROSPA not only will they help you save money on your car insurance but make you a much better driver which will mean that later on when you're not crashing you protect that NCD which is all important. I've also found it pays to be pushy with insurance companies.  Get a few of the best quotes and ask if thats the best they can really do, sound kind of disinterested because they'll think you're looking at a quote which is less than theirs. My first car was a classic car, Triumph Spitfire. This is was much cheaper to insure than most others. Its a two seater, and the less seats the better from the insurance point of view. They know that if you've got 4 mates in the car they can all claim £5000 for whiplash on your policy if you crash. If you can only have one passenger thats going to cost them a lot less. Also people tend to really look after classic cars. If you think about changing cars, go classic, plus it'll teach you about maintaining your own cars.

He may develop the skill-set to handle the center in the future, but if not then he'd make a great winger.  

Cameron Jerome is a nice piece but it looks like he'll be joining Bolton for £6m.  I like him, but not with that price tag.

As far as the defense is concerned, I'd like to take a wait and see approach.   The transfers we bring in may change our style of play a bit and I want to see how it all shakes out before addressing needs on the back end.  I like your suggestion of Nathaniel Clyne.  He looks like he'll continue to grow, and if we could get him for 2m we'd be getting a bargain.  Wolverhampton made an offer last season for him and he rejected it without even talking to them.  Maybe because it was Wolverhampton, maybe he did't feel ready yet.  Either way we should make an offer.

Torchwood peaked in Children of Earth but seems to gone to the other extreme now in Miracle Day. You pretty much summed up my thoughts; far too slow moving and long-winded (Children of Earth worked as a multi-episode story as it was only five parts, Miracle Day is limping its way towards 10), a not particularly strong plot, and weak new characters. Plus too many annoying and unnecessary time-wasters: For example [](/s ""Jack is right in the middle of saving the world and decides that the most important thing he can do is... run off to a bar and pick someone up for a quickie.""), [](/s ""Gwen's constant switches between the UK and US""), and [](/s ""How every time Gwen and Rhys are about to be captured by hordes of troops they decide to stop for a nice chat and a 5 minute snog before running off in seperate directions"").

If this was the only way they could fund more series of Torchwood then I wish they'd not bothered and just let it lay dormant for now.

true,foxtrottuniform,null,null,"RFL (road fund licence) is already cheaper for those with less polluting vehicles. In fact if you drive a 125cc motorbike which gets 70 or 80mpg if you don't ride like a twit then you pay £15 a year in RFL. If you incorporated insurance then yes it would go up but that can only be linked to the likelihood of that vehicle to do damage. However electric cars really aren't the answer, well not at the moment. You charge your car up and where does the power come from? In the end a good deal of it comes from coal fired power stations. Wave, wind and solar are all very good but they won't keep up with energy demands, especially if we all start driving electric cars. Not to mention the toll on the earth when it comes to mining lithium for the batteries. The current range of electric vehicles is also very poor. So that leads us on to hybrids, well again you're mining lithium and charging the batteries with an internal combustion engine which is running on polluting petroleum products. There are diesel engines out there that allow cars to get similar if not better efficiency than a hybrid and ergo are less polluting so they should be charged even less. 

But all said and done the most effective way of cutting pollution is to increase the use of mass transit/public transport so we could actually think about funding that properly and making the prices reasonable so that people might actually want to use it. From the outskirts of London to central London cost me nearly a tenner the other day, what is that? £50 a week! That only gets me to two very specific places from which I then have to get a bus from at either end, buses which take forever and cost £1.20 each. None of it is pleasant to use frankly I'd rather sit in my car going no where rather than sniffing some dude's armpit whilst standing up and getting jostled around and looking at a bunch of faces that (quite rightly) look like they're competing for the best slapped arse impression.

Ads for rents can be *very* misleading. There are a lot of beautiful flats in town, but many advised ones can be terrible. Terrible like in, impossible to live in. If you don't mind, go for a shared flat: you'll pay less (rents for a small flat outside the center can easily be 700£/month plus council tax) and chances of having a decent place to live are higher. I know there are beautiful shared apartments in the Gilbert Road/Victoria Road area, for example - which is residential but close to the center. If you're like me and want to live by yourself, go for it, but be prepared for high prices and not necessarily awesome flats. I secured a relatively nice one, but I was lucky.

Ask any Doctor and he’ll say  
Only Dr Who-per tastes that way

Given the track record of previous cost estimates for the trams project however, one could be forgiven for entertaining some scepticism.

The Scottish Government has declined to provide additional funding to complete the project, and this was known at the time of the council's decision, so the loan isn't really a surprise -- this borrowing is an expected consequence of the decision back in June.  As I said elsewhere, I think the £1billion figure is misleading.

The figures in the OP's article indicate borrowing of £231m -- I haven't done the sums to work out the effective interest rate on the loan, and I don't know enough to say if it's ""cheap"" or not for this sort of project.

true,scattergather,null,null,"Ah, interesting to hear about the reinstatement clause being the principal cause of the high cancellation costs.  Given your proposed solution, I'd have several questions (which I recognise may not to be easy to find answers to, but I'd be interested if you know anything further about the issue).

Firstly, what would be the costs and consequences of cancelling leaving things more or less as they are be?  E.g. are there penalty clauses, additional restorative work costs, potential legal costs etc that would kick in?  There may also be a knock-on effect of increasing the costs of any future large construction/infrastructure investment if companies are made more wary of doing business with the council as a result of contractual tussles or breaches (given the present economic climate, however, I think this is probably of limited importance).

Secondly, did the council give adequate consideration to a course of action such as you describe?  From a political perspective, this would be the key point, since if they failed to do so, that would make the whole thing rather a stitch-up.  Of course, it may be that the consequences of such a course were discovered to be obviously unacceptable at an early stage and consideration discontinued, and as far as I'm concerned that would be fair enough, though you might well disagree.

It's fairly obvious with hindsight that the trams project should never have been begun (maybe even at the time), but the decision on whether or not to continue with the project should be evaluated independently.  With £750m cancellation costs, the decision doesn't exactly look finely balanced, but if as you suggest those costs could be reduced significantly then it may be enough to tip the scales.  

The good money after bad line is a touch glib given that the estimated cost of completion was being explicitly compared with the estimated cost of cancellation (although it is sensitive to the degree to which a completed tram system would be an asset to Edinburgh and the risk of further cost overruns)...  but if the cancellation cost is grossly overestimated as you suggest, I take your point.",0,1313885525,null,0,true,0,c2dzd34,t3_joxjo,t1_c2dzd34,t1_c2dyzai,1427498109,3,false,Edinburgh,t5_2rffi,3

You'd think that the public sector would have learned how to write a contract by now, but apparently not.

2 - Haven't a scooby. The referendum on congestion charging did not give a no trams option. To me, that would suggest that they didn't want to be told to get stuffed by the population from the beginning. The difficulty as a voter is figuring out just who that was, and ousting them.

Not only does it reflect the opinions of the majority of the audience at the time, but it is very clear that over the course of series 10 really became to like being himself, and he felt that he still had so much more to do. It is clearly said, by him, several times, especially during The End of Time, that he does not want to regenerate, that he doesn't want to change. He even goes so far to call the then unseen 11th Doctor ""So new man..."" putting a whole new, very negative spin on the concept of regeneration.

Sure he said his goodbyes and he seemed to accept his fate towards the end, but who you in the face of what is practically your death? Nothing of 10 survived the regeneration, even though he so clearly wanted it too, as shown in the TARDIS tearing itself apart. Everyone he'd ever loved had left him, from the Time Lords to Rose to Donna to  Madame de Pompadour, and the tipping point for him was the Ood's prophecy of his death.

People seem to talk as if it’s a bad thing that they felt bad about the regeneration, but that's how you were supposed to feel. It’s practically the opposite of the 9-10 regeneration, where he'd just saved the universe and everything was upbeat and happy. Here he'd just saved the universe at the cost of never seeing his people again, the people that he killed and felt remorse for his entire life.

So no, it didn't ""break the character"", it just showed us a side of the character we didn't really want to seem, but was necessary for what the show wanted to convey. 10 went from a figure of excitement and wonder in our eyes to, over the course of three seasons starting at the end of Season 2, to a remorseful, depressed, lonely character who just wanted to keep living his life the way it was.",0,1313893387,null,0,false,0,c2e05x5,t3_jnx8q,t1_c2e05x5,t1_c2doey9,1427498485,2,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,2

Last season he had one of the best passing completion percentages. 

&gt; Mikel is as good as he was when he first joined us, not better, nor worse

Whaaaaaat? When Mikel joined he was far too aggressive. Picked up a high number of red cards, had no range of forward passes and poor positioning. The aggression has gone down and he hardly picks up yellows anymore, his positional sense has improved and his range of passes has expanded beyond the easy side pass.

Mikel typically looks for the first pass to start the counterattack so he hardly dribbles or takes defenders on. From where he usually gets the ball, this is a good thing. He's a distributor, he doesn't maintain possession through dribbles, but rather passes. Aggressive in possesion? What else is he supposed to do with the ball? As I said his vision and range of passes are clearly expanding. Last season we had the fewest goals against in the EPL and Mikel played a vital, quiet role in that.

It's just incredible to think about it at least for me. If we were to set off for one of these distant galaxies by the time we reached there it is very well possible that humanity would have evolved into something else entirely or gone extinct.

Broken down we spend around £850 to rent a tiny one bedroom flat (that figure includes bills) between the two of us. Because we couldn't find a job in the same place we now each commute around 40 to 60 miles per day (return) and pay roughly £200 per month in car maintenance and fuel each. 

The kicker is the following: A colleague of mine who started working where I do 5 years ago had a starting salary of £18k. He was also a graduate. When I started working there I got the same starting salary. I was doing the same job as my colleague, just I got paid between £2k - £3k less in real terms.

true,LokianEule,mccoy,Time's Champion,"Well I got introduced into the show after Tennant left and before Smith started. I liked Tennant and immediately got into the show. My thought was, before the Eleventh Hour started, that Smith was going to have a hell of a time topping Tennant. I was worried he wouldn't, hoped he would, but didn't see how he could. 

After the first episode I thought to myself ""Boy, that was one helluva episode. Choosing between the two will be tough."" It didn't take long for me to be pro-Smith. So I preferred Smith. The writing was the deal-breaker for me. I'll take Moffat's fairy tale stories over RTD's soap opera any day.

Until last week when I went back and rewatched some old Tennant like Silence in the Library/Forest of the Dead which is so great now that I understand it more. My thought was ""How could I have thought Smith was better?!""

Of course when I watch classics I think ""Why can't we go back to old times when things were like this? Or when Hartnell turned to Troughton I said, he's just not the *same*!""

So what I'm saying is, I don't have a favorite. While I watch the episode, I'm convinced that whichever Doctor I'm watching, is the best. That and they're all just too different. Sometimes I'm in a 3rd Doctor mood, or a 11th, or a 9th. Or Shalka...

But as far as watchability, plotline quality and such, I'll generally side with Smith over Tennant (unless it's a Moffat story). But I won't pick Smith over Tennant or Tennant over Smith as a Doctor.

true,LokianEule,mccoy,Time's Champion,"Hmm I don't think the 11th is a pessimist. He's a good judge of character. He recognized the gravity of the situation. Hungry Earth/Cold Blood was very much a moral dilemma. He had to be objective and look at things from both sides. The Silurians had been asleep and were convinced that humans were inferior, and us humans very much in shock that there even were aliens. Of course there's going to be some xenophobia and he had to tread lightly.

The Doctor is still about humans being the best they can be, you can see that, after the woman kills Elaya, the way the Doctor condemns her actions, saying that she is better than that. Regarding being a genius, 11 is very much the ""absent-minded professor"" always forgetting things. 10 on the other hand loves to have huge epiphanies, shouting out in exclamation. He is less subtle than Smith, and I think it's a result of his previous experience acting on stage.

The difference between Smith and Tennant's Doctors is that Tennant was very human, but Smith is very alien. His emotions are alien, the way he acts and thinks (not surprising for a 900 year old Gallifreyan) is alien.

About the awkward, one aspect of Smith's Doctor is something that adds to his alien-ness, is the insistence that things like fezzes or bowties are cool despite the obvious of what people say. While this is a neat aspect, that he marches to his own drum it's also more a result of what I'm about to mention:

Two things specific about Smith's era are that firstly, the showrunners are really playing up the catch phrases, encouraging fans to capitalize on it, which yes gets me a little too, but I ignore it.

Secondly, the Doctor is going through a major change or at least study in character, about who he is. A Good Man Goes to War is showing us that maybe the Doctor isn't always the good guy. River Song's speech says it all:

""The man who can turn an army against him at the mention of his name. Doctor, the word for wise man and healer. We get that from you, you know. But if you keep going on the way you have, what might that word come to mean? To the people of the Gamma forests, the word Doctor means mighty warrior.""

Sometimes shit like this happens with flatmates, and there's not much you can do about it.

She's unethical enough to be trying to rip the OP off, and she'll justify it any way she can in her head to save a few quid. If the OP comes up with the original bills she's find some other excuse, and in her head she'll be saying to herself ""I shouldn't have to pay this because *&lt;some reason why bibs is a bastard&gt;*"".

She's being greedy about money, but she'll probably self-rationalise with other petty grievances so she can continue to be angry at the OP and feel OK with herself about not paying it. 

The only way to get her to pay is to make it too inconvenient not to, and I don't see any easy way to do that enough. Get all the bills and nag her enough and maybe she'll offer to pay half of it or a quarter. I don't know how much the OP feels he's owed, but I would guess that if he's looking at £200, she'll be thinking that £40 or £50 is ""fair"". Not because it *is* fair, but because she doesn't want to pay £200.

The only thing I can think is to take her to small claims court. The OP can file locally, and she will have to travel back from the opposite side of the country to appear in court and defend herself. If she doesn't show up then OP wins automatically and if she still doesn't pay then he can file with a bailiffs company who will take her stuff and recoup his money effectively for free (they take their fees out of the repossession). The standard of evidence at small claims court is ""reasonable"", so they wouldn't expect to see itemised bills from every utility, but would be satisfied with a year of the OP's bank statements, provided that they show the direct debits as ""Anglian Water £40"", ""British Gas £30"" and so on. I don't think the OP would need to file this evidence in advance, he just turns up to court with 12 months of printed bank statements, maybe 2 extra photocopies of each with the amounts highlighted. Print a spreadsheet itemising those into a total for clarity. Only problem with this is that he needs her physical address not just an email address, but I guess he can say ""ok, I've got a whole stack of photocopies here I need to send you, what's your address?"" Don't bother with the photocopies, just a registered letter saying ""you know you owe me this much, here are the monthly amounts, pay up or I'll take you to small claims court""; follow up 2 weeks later with the summons.",0,1313913070,null,0,false,0,c2e20z0,t3_joz63,t1_c2e20z0,t1_c2e1xdy,1427499373,10,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,10

I appreciate you don't want to spend money on this, but this seems pretty simple, not something a solicitor would see much money in (they mostly make their money off unfair dismissal tribunals, often on a no-win-no-fee basis - if they win then it's the bad employer who pays them). In my experience solicitors tend to be quite chatty and helpful, and they'll give you enough pointers that you'll be able to write a letter to your former employer and say the right thing; send it registered post and that you'll expect a result within 14 days.

My knee-jerk reaction is to say to take your former employer to small claims court for wages to cover the period since you were last paid. They haven't paid you any money and they can't prove that you're legitimately no longer working for them.

Completely agree with you.

IANAL, but IMO saying that you believe in the right to silence and that you believe its removal (in the 1994 the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act, I think) to be unjust should be sufficient reason to explain your silence during questioning.

To the jury you will seem uncooperative and a bit ""different"" (which is not desirable) but political protest does seem like reasonable grounds why someone might refuse to talk to the police.

A bad experience with the cops has proven to me that they routinely lie about the events they've witnessed, at the time of booking at least. Their statements should be subject to the same scrutiny yours are - if they lie on the stand, then that's perjury.

If you talk to them at interview they can lie to you with impunity, and your memory of events will be held to a higher standard than anything they say. If they have CCTV footage then they are not obliged to show it to you at interview - they hope you will misremember innocent actions just to make you look guilty and ""prove"" you're a liar. Before presenting CCTV evidence in court I believe they would be obliged to show it to you.

It might not be up to you whether you go to court or not. If they think they can secure a conviction they'll likely pursue the prosecution, at least to magistrates court or getting you to accept a caution or something.

If you accept that they have all the power in determining stuff like that (and they do) then it may make it easier for you to steel yourself and call their bluff. Even if you cooperated with them completely, did whatever they asked (""we know you didn't mean to do it, we're not after you"") they can still put you in the dock.

Going to court is not such a big deal. Sure, it'll be nerve-wracking, but if you don't face prison then there's no real downside. The upside is that you may be found not guilty. If you accept a caution then you'll have a criminal record - you'll have to disclose it to employers or if you ever seek a visa to spend time in the USA (for example) (or perhaps, too, if you wish to emigrate elsewhere).

Switching souls with the Doctor while he was put in the TARDIS and she did this to save him. Therefore, that was why the Doctor said he was that old instead of 909. I don't know, it's very far fetched and raises even more questions in the process: what to do now since his body is burned, if his soul is the TARDIS what happens after taking it etc. But for some reason, had a feeling that maybe it was important to show us the soul of the TARDIS this series.

3. Tesco is a ten minute walk along the riverside from Magdalene, and is huge. It's a bit cheaper than Sainsburys, and I'd say it's definitely the place to go for coffee maker / other kitchen equipment.

true,[deleted],null,null,"Gotta agree with this. I think mikel has shaped up his game really well from a few seasons ago. I was kinda overly critical (admittedly unfairly too) of him the first game, but thought he looked solid yesterday. Comparing him from a few seasons ago his positioning is much better and his tackling is much sharper. He fouls less, wins the ball more and I think he has done a much better job of breaking up play. On top of that he is very solid on the ball, rarely looses possession and rarely misplaces a pass. Him and ramires have been very good at breaking up counterattacks I think at least.

I don't really think Mikel is our problem right now but it would be nice to have a different style DM available just for squad flexibility and matching up. Maybe romeu can fill this role.

Right now though I'm slightly worried about Lampard. Hes solid and has an unmatched understanding of his teamates and the chelsea style. However, it looks like his best years are probably behind him. I wish McEachran was a year or two older because I thought his preseason performance was really impressive. The midfield looked very tight with him in it, he held the ball at the right time, moved the ball around/switched play at the right time, and then made good decisions going forward when the opportunities were right. His intelligence is great, and he can put the tempo and flow of the whole game on  his shoulders.

You might be right about Lampard. The only way to tell is to try something different. AVB may feel he's under too much pressure right now to swap Lampard out for McEachran as admittedly, that is a risky move. I don't think he has any faith in Benayoun to try that one.

true,ermintwang,english,MCR,"Hey, you're doing it wrong. Especially for TV and Radio. If there is one thing in this world I have learnt to do well it is getting work experience in TV and Radio. I have worked on a variety of shows, both as work experience and paid, and I recently started work for the biggest radio group in the country. You said in another post that you don't send out personalised cover letters because it's 'just' work experience - error. Work experience and being someone's free bitch is the only way you get work nowadays, and it's fiercely competitive. 

1. You have to personalise your emails, a cut and paste job is not worth even sending out. HR won't even bother with it, especially if it's unsolicited. 
2. Sending it to 'info' and 'information' is basically pointless. What programmes do you like? All the BBC/ITV addresses are standardized. Got someone's name and you've got their e-mail (may not work for John/Jane Smiths). Handily, programmes have an address book section at the end known as the credits. Watch the programmes you like, get the name of the production manager and production co-ordinator and send them an e-mail telling them how fucking incredible they are and how they've inspired you to be a better person
3. DON'T mention that you want to do presenting. Seriously. 
4. You have to stand out with your first line, and not be too formal.
5. Exploit any and all connections to anything. 
6. Don't discount the small players - go to mandy.com - there are ALWAYS independent film-makers and programmes looking for people to work for lo/no-pay. And you get to do a lot.
7. The BBC/ITV/Sky, the big radio groups, and media organisations like Vision+Media all have pools, apprenticeships and mentoring programmes which are far better to focus on (these are different from BBC work experience 'placements' - applying for them is pretty useless too). Vision+Media/your regional equivalent are great resources, btw.
8. Twitter is SO useful. Get following everyone and post stuff about how you love TV and are excited to begin work at an incredible production company. This also counts for blogs.
9. And just as an aside, your degree (and mine) means fuck all professionally- it entitles to precisely nothing in this business. The fact that you're a post-graduate is a little boon to chat about at wrap parties, that's it (unless you learned how to use a camera/sound equipment - in which case, well bloody done). This also means you can have ANY degree.

Actually, it is improving drastically - the main problem is the bigotted minority are the ones in charge (and I am referring to most of the main parties here - not just the DUP).  I would say that the recent Pride Parade in Belfast with the numbers attending and the amount of families shows that as a country we are getting much more tolerant.

This could be a really important test of devolved parliaments within EU-level member states.

EU members, from my reading of the article, have to treat students from other EU countries as they treat their own, national students.

But within the UK, England doesn't want to spend its money on students, whereas Scotland does (and thus chooses to devote a chunk of budget toward that). 

It sounds to me like the test case is seeking to have English students at Scottish universities have the same rights as Scottish and EU students at Scottish universities.

TBH, that sounds *fair* and *right* but ***expensive***.

I think it's a cynical ploy to force Scottish universities to charge Scottish students in Scotland the same as English students at English (or Scottish) universities in England (or Scotland).

Even though that is not the will of the Scottish Assembly.

All part of the Amercanization/commoditization of education-for-profit perhaps?

So, in a perfect world, it would be fair and right that all students within the EU be treated equally-as-well as Scottish students. Including English students at Scottish universities.

But, equal sovereign nations within the EU chose to fund education differently. Fairynuff. 

The point I was trying to make was that if England chooses not to invest in its future, in equal access to education, and then uses EU law to demand that *either* we treat Scottish and EU students as English students are treated in England (read, fees) *or* v.v. treat English students as Scottish and EU students are treated in Scotland (read, Scottish Universities providing for free that which English Universities will not), then it will prove to be expensive for Scotland to educate English students.

This could reasonably  be extended to other EU nations (higher education is cheap in the Netherlands btw), but the special circumstances of cross-border studying (I have no citation, but think there's a lot of English students coming to Scottish institutions) make this bitingly relevant.

Seems some of your points have been said in other comments too (Which shows me consistency in criticism). It's all very helpful to me... I actually feel like I might lose it sometimes. You are right, I have a lot of energy which at this moment in time isn't being used constructively and it worries me what I could go on to do in my frustration.

I hate this *real* fact about a degree basically being meaningless. I feel I have wasted so much time, money and energy to line someone elses pockets with. I never did amazingly well but always tried. It annoys me that after all my hard work I'm now being bossed about by people who have worked straight out of GCSE's... All this time thinking I was doing 'good' by getting an education now seems to me like I should have just fucked about at school and left at 16 *knowing* what I wanted to do instead of 'following what people thought was right for me'.

true,Sariel007,null,null,"""I don't think it dilutes conversation. Getting more opinions, whether they're the same or not, gives someone a wider view on the general consensus.""

It dilutes the conversation (if there is any to be had) because person X sees my comment and comments on it. Then person Y sees your comment that says the same thing as mine and makes a completely different comment from person X. Person X and Y could advance an argument had they seen their comments but because they are in different threads nothing comes of it. By putting the same opinions/comments in one thread it is easier to see all the opinions on the same matter. As for the general consensus comment well that is what the little arrows on the left are for. If your argument is the same as mine click up hit reply and elaborate. Then everyone can agree or disagree with us. For an example go to the front page of r/all and read the comments.

What I haven't seen anyone mention is that you can and should notify the [National Secular Society](http://www.secularism.org.uk/contactus.html) (NSS) as well as possibly the [British Humanist Association](http://www.humanism.org.uk/contact) (BHA). They keep a close eye on these sorts of things and will be happy you let them know. They will probably also give you advice on how you can deal with the issue if needs be. My personal advice to you would be to gather as much information as possible - mainly their own literature if you can get your hands on it. Leaflets, flyers etc.

When it comes to promising to cure things (i.e. illnesses NOT homosexuality ffs - that's another kettle of fish) then the [Advertising Standards Authority have recently clamped down on ""woo"" claims by religious groups](http://blog.echurchwebsites.org.uk/2011/06/29/advertising-standards-authority-asa-bans-church-leaflet-claimed-god-heal-illnesses/). Depending on what they are claiming to be able to treat, they could be in a good deal of trouble. For example it's illegal [to claim you can cure cancer](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Geo6/2-3/13/section/4) and has been for many decades. The NSS can and may advise you with regards the ASA, though the ASA now have a way you can make a complaint about online content. [The Nightingale Collaboration](http://www.nightingale-collaboration.org/) has information on this, though I think that's aimed more at healthcare professionals - Does the church make claims on their website?

Basically, get as much info as possible and give it to the above people as well as MP etc if you can. When it comes to groups like this, I think it's worth preparing your case before you hang them out to dry. National attention is always useful.

Hope this helps - Keep us informed? Cheers.

In terms of your opening line, I think you need to understand that a lot of viewers felt personally betrayed and/or offended at Christopher Eccleston ""leaving after just one series.""  It's been pretty well-publicized by now that he had major trouble getting on with some of the higher-ups making the show, meaning that he was looking to leave and they weren't really that motivated to try and keep him.  A lot of people have (mis)interpreted this as Eccleston being a prima donna (or primo uomo, technically) who ""quit the team"", which makes them less inclined to talk positively of him.

I think that is a contributing factor to why there isn't a lot of talk about Nine, but it's not really the main reason.  A much bigger part of the answer is that Eccleston was the doctor for one year, Tennant for 4 and a halfish, so to compare the two: there's just more Tennant content to talk about.  And Smith?  Of course he gets talked about because he's the thing right now.  All the curiosity and excitement and mystery and conversation about what's going on with the show currently is inexorably about ""his"" Doctor.  We don't hang on every little nugget of information about old episodes; we DO hang one very little nugget of information about new ones.

I have loved all three of the new Doctors thoroughly.  I remain blown away at the depth and gravitas that Eccleston carried that neither Tennant nor Smith have yet been able to match.

It's easily google-able and it helped me start classic Who from episode 1.

I started with the 2nd season (2006) with David Tennant and worked my way up until the current season. Then I went back and watched season 1 from 2005 as a 'prequel'.

So you may enjoy doing something similar. I started with Tennant as I'd heard so much good stuff about him, and that way I had more than 2 seasons to watch 'til I was caught up.
Or you could start at season 1 or even the most recent one if you don't have the time on your hands to watch so many.

There they received certification, or a doctorate in medicine, so they could be called ""Doctors of Medicine.""  

The real objection to Moffat's idea is that it's totally English-centric to the exclusion of every other language where an M.D. or Ph.D. is called something other than ""Doctor.""

&gt; She may have a privileged background but isn't she better for exposing it and thinking about solutions to it than some equally privileged telegraph hack who doesn't?

Maybe if she was truly sincere in it. But she isn't. Gates and Buffett are providing tons of their own money to help and actually make a difference. Toynbee is writing blatantly politicised biased crap because a tax avoiding newspaper pays her to do so. I doubt that, if she becomes unemployed, she's going to spend her time doing anything to help. She is incredibly out of touch.

&gt; It is hypocritical of the Guardian to avoid taxes while running articles exposing tax dodging but again, isn't that better than not exposing tax dodgers like the right wing press?

I can detect a theme here. You seem to have a thing against the ""right wing press"" and as such it is okay for the Guardian to be the hypocrites they are. It's not just that they avoid tax, it's that they sugarcoat it in ""we're only a newspaper, we need to avoid tax to stay afloat, woe are us"". 

If they published a front page article exposing GMG's antics they'd get more support from me, but all they have done is the online equivalent of the bottom of a back page biased editorial.

&gt; If that doesn't concern you then I think you need your world view adjusted.

How many of the rioters are in that position? They obviously weren't undernourished enough or disease ridden to stop them from torching and/or stealing private property. The pictures of people with their ""haul"" (mostly Xbox merchandise) suggest they're at home, with running water, electricity, an internet connection, etc. Doesn't seem like poverty to me.

I think that writing to your MP would ultimately be a waste of time as far as actually getting anything done goes, but it wouldn't do any harm to register your concern about the issue. Since you're one of their constituents they're duty-bound to send you a reply which may come in useful later. Unfortunately your MP appears to be a gospel-singing, intelligent design and homeopathy advocating Free Presbyterian wingnut- in other words a fairly typical Democratic Unionist MP. I don't imagine you're going to find him sympathetic towards the gays in a gays vs church scenario, although you never know- the church you describe appears to target the same sort of gullible fuckwits as the Free Presbyterian Church so there may be some unfriendly competition between the two.

Your best bet would probably be to contact local Northern Irish secular, gay and human rights organisations who have more experience in this area and would be able to at least offer more relevant advice as to what to do next. This is where the reply from your MP could be useful- particularly if they are being unhelpful. The reply will be in the form of a letter written on House of Commons notepaper and may be assumed, unless specifically stated otherwise, to be suitable for publication.

It might also be worth contacting one of your MLAs- namely the SDLP one Dolores Kelly, as the SDLP has a better history of promoting human rights than the other parties. ",0,1314001331,null,0,false,0,c2ea8q4,t3_jpvqn,t1_c2ea8q4,t3_jpvqn,1427503314,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

The Doctor pops up in an Earth country in elder days, gives the locals his name, which translates to the local word they later learn to use for Doctor, and after saving everybody (apart from the occasional necessary dramatic sacrifice for sakes of drama) they start using their word for Doctor as healer.

It's only English-centric in our minds 'cos the show is in English. To the Japanese/Indian/Atlantean they'd hear their local word for Doctor, which will have evolved into the term they use for a healer today.  So he'd be called *Isha* in Japan, but we hear it as Doctor, as the show is not in Japanese.  

If he landed in the middle ages, his local name would have been *Lerare*, old english for Doctor, but we would still hear him say Doctor on the show.

I think the point is that he was mad busy all over the place, coining the term Doctor for so many cultures and nations, as he fixed up whole nations in 42 minute chunks.

Sadly, everyone now seems to believe that a degree is simply a form of vocational training. And really, it's a rubbish way to train people for semi-menial work.

So, in short, your degree may seem like a waste now, and it won't make your life easier in the short term. But ... once you get going and realise how much more limited the people (in the main) who never did further education are, you will appreciate it. Hopefully.

true,j612,null,null,"As others have said, cans are probably fine. There's often a limit set by the festival (to ensure they get your cash at the bars, which tend to be very expensive) and so I recommend you put a bunch of beer in both your larger main bag (as many as will fit) and a smaller, hand held bag. If you want to take spirits in, then I recommend emptying a plastic bottle of water or something and then filling it up with a spirit and placing it deep inside your bag. Boxed wine is also a great shout.

Food is fine to bring in. I would recommend high-density foods, because you don't want to be spending loads of time eating, I would think. Cereal bars, bagels and peanut butter, maybe some fruit. Food is also expensive at festivals, so either stock up or be prepared not to eat very much. If you buy tinned food, make sure it has a ring pull or that you have a can opener. Use your own judgement on this one, really.

They may well have a sniffer dog at the main gate and some security people searching bags, but generally they are very ineffective. When it comes to drug stashing, everyone has their own favourite ways. You can wrap it up in cling film and tape and put it inside your sleeping bad, tape it to your private areas or inside your shoe. A personal favourite for festivals is to open a pot noodle very carefully, empty the contents, insert drugs, replace contents and then re-seal the foil lid with superglue. Then place in bag. If done correctly, it does not look suspicious at all, especially considering that a lot of people take pot noodles or similar to festivals. It won't look out of place in your bag, and you even get a tasty pot noodle. If you smoke cigarettes or need tobacco, buy lots of pouches/packs outside the festival. And take a few spare lighters/packs of papers/etc.

Bring a large empty bottle to fill up with water (very important), a toothbrush (while you shouldn't care about personal hygiene too much at a festival in my opinion, I draw the line here), wet wipes are a must, toilet paper (so so essential. do not skip this one), chewing gum. Check the weather the day you go down. If heavy rain is likely, bring wellies + thin rainproof. If only a little bit of rain is predicted to fall, I say risk it, though that can end badly... Don't bring too many clothes, and although I don't really do it, a lot of people like to dress up in silly clothes for the weekend, which can be handy for making some new friends etc. Pretty much, bring as little as possible while covering the various different possibilities. I like to be prepared, but I try not to get silly. Everyone will do it slightly different, you just have to find out what works for you. One friend of mine swears by duct tape and a pen knife, for example, in order to fix tents/affix large drinks to hands etc. I know others that turn up with precious little but a tent, a sleeping bag and their wallet.

Make friends with the people camped near you and watch out for each other's stuff. Don't leave valuables in your tent, if you bring any. Use your phone as little as possible, and if you have a nice phone then think about finding a substitute brick for the weekend (also helps for battery life). If you want drugs, ask around. Have a chat with anybody selling drugs before you buy to make sure they seem alright. Don't buy any drugs off anyone walking through a crowd at a dance tent saying 'pills, coke' etc. Chat to random people, watch out for your friends and get messy. 

TL;DR: Everyone does festivals differently, but definitely bring toilet paper and a large empty plastic bottle; the rest of my advice is optional.",0,1314006108,null,0,false,0,c2eahse,t3_jq3xm,t1_c2eahse,t3_jq3xm,1427503431,7,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,7

true,corners,tom-baker,Tom Baker,"&gt;If the show has been on continuously since the sixties, how could there be a season one in 2005? 

It hasn't been on continuously, and other have addressed that :) 


&gt;Is this all the same show, or is this some newer version of the show with a different story line? 

It is all the same show with the same background story. Of course new elements have been added here in there to fill in the gab between the shows cancellation in 1989 and its restart in 2005. Also, as you can imagine with such a long show there have been several story arcs and many revisited stories. Some of the old story arcs from the classic show are revisited in the new show. 


&gt;If I started watching the 2005 version, would I be totally lost?

No, they started in 2005 with the understanding that many of the new watches wouldn't have seen the classic show so they wrote so people new to the show wouldn't be completely lost.


On a more confusing note about your first question: The classic show used the term ""Season"", of which there were 26 from 1963 to 1989, and the new show uses the term ""Series"" starting in 2005. So technically, there is only one Season 1 which started in 1963 and the Season 1 you are referring to in 2005 is actually called Series 1. See not confusing at all from a non-linear, non-subjective viewpoint - it's more like a big ball of wibbly wobbly... time-y wimey... stuff ;)   ",0,1314023826,null,0,false,0,c2ebn05,t3_jq4y4,t1_c2ebn05,t3_jq4y4,1427503973,3,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,3

The people who pay for the roads to be dug up are...... you and me. Gas bills help pay for maintenance, electricity and water bills the same, council rates pay for surface works.

Go to the article and hit ctrl+f and look for noise, or noisy, or loud. Go on, try it.

Lets not pretend that this is avoidable, Someone has forgotten that roadworks are above all else, noisy. Unless it's an emergency job, you can almost never work outside of council mandated hours. Fire up the breaker on a JCB after 7pm in London and see how long it takes for the council to show up telling you to stop(hint: about 30 minutes).

So the council will be able to set the hours a company is able to work, and then charge them for not working outside of those hours. Does anyone else see a conflict of interest here? 

Does anyone honestly think that residents are going to stand up and say ""Please make noise all night long so that these roadworks are finished sooner, the sound of concrete being broken soothes me to sleep so well....""

Companies will stick this unavoidable cost(+10% admin fee) straight onto their customers(the utilities), who hardly even need an excuse to raise their prices these days, and you and me pay.

I am looking into moving closer to work so I can walk in as rushour driving in such traffic is really stressful and there are no sensible public transport options from where I live (3 buses, or 2 trains + 20 minutes walk).

When I was a student I actually lived only 15-30 minutes away from the area I work in if you went by car (it's next to my uni ..) but had to take two buses. This could take 30 minutes or over an hour depending on how they were running and traffic.

Nowadays I would allow up to an hour for a commute, but focus more on it being *not stressful*. A single bus or train would be alright, or a driving route that's not too traffic-laden.

There are very few cases where political correctness really has caused any problems, it just makes for very interesting news articles and thus sells a lot of papers for people who like to have a moan about things, which, unsurprisingly, being as this is a Britain, is a very effective way to sell newspapers.


If you say too much modern immigration is a problem because it means welfare recipients are less likely to work, then I agree. (Although I think that's a bit left-wing). If you say too much immigration in too short a time is going to cause cultural tensions, then I agree also.

But it's when people just flat-out decide that immigrants are bad that causes problems. These people do not justify it like you do, because when you question them they shift from one reason to the next, struggling to justify their view. It's very easy to see that the view is not based on logic, or the real world. It's incredibly easy to see through.  Some people just don't like foreigners. And then they blame it all on ""the PC brigade"" for stifling any reasonable debate on immigration. No mate, it's not the PC brigade. It's basic human decency. When you can't outline specific problems with immigration that back up your view point, it becomes apparent that you are just prejudiced against people that are different to you. There are many, many, many positive reasons for immigration. There are also negative consequences.

There are not many arguments against immigration that are grounded in logic, which is why if you are flat out against any form of immigration at any level, it can appear that you just don't like foreigners.

Now, if you think it's the ""PC Brigade's"" fault that it is considered bad form to just not like foreigners, then you are an idiot. That has nothing to do with the PC Brigade. That's just basic fucking manners.

1. For the maths (quantitative reasoning) section: **immediately skip verbose questions** - there are a mixture of question lengths spread through the entire section. Find and answer the one or two liners first, get them under your belt. You can go back to the wordy ones towards the end. If you don't do this, you'll get bogged down and will miss out on easy marks. It is easy to score 750+ if you do this.

2. Use the whiteboard to write down common phrases that appear in the code-word one. They tend to all be based around a single theme, so you can easily reduce your workload by noticing the common patterns.

3. Verbal reasoning can be tricky depending on the passages given. If I were you, read the question first then scan the passage. Reading the passage first will bog you down in miscellanea.

4. For the abstract reasoning, unless you are the rainman, you're going to have to try the best you can. It doesn't need to be said that you should answer all the questions, even if it is a case of randomly selecting an answer as you page through them in the final minutes.

General tip, just relax and eat a banana before hand. It's a long test, and while not particularly hard, can be quite draining looking at that fuzzy screen.

Use your score to determine the places to apply. Good (700+) scores, you want be be looking at places like Notts, Sheff and other unis that value the UKCAT highly in selection. Not so good, (&lt;700), you might want to look at those that consider it less important or do not bother with it at all.

For the sake of your furtive serial killer scrap book, however, you can have my serious take on Spielberg:  
I'm not the type of anal retentitive who would take seriously any attempt to pin down the precise year in which his decline began, or even believe that's how gradual slumps work.  The hint there being 'gradual'.  I think he has been on the wane from the mid eighties onwards, but even so, some of his films after this period are more bearable than others.  Then I go off and live my life, happy that my opinion on Spielberg is finally sorted, and I can find other things to worry about.

So basically you seem to be on a misunderstanding from the start, and went in a downward spiral from there.  And you're quite the aggro pottymouth.  You're not being civil, mature or interesting, and your general tone is dismally grating and prosaic, so this is goodbye from me.

But, perhaps most importantly, it is pretty damn well-written.  Especially the last couple of seasons.  Add to that the fact that the shows work equally well as a serial or standalone episodes, and you have the formula for a hit.  

Babylon 5 figured this out in the 90s.  BSG and Lost tried this more recently and lost their way when the writers wrote themselves into a corner.  

Doctor Who seems to be getting it right -- let things remain undone for a time, leave fans guessing, and make it complicated but not so complicated that people will be screaming foul when you do your reveal.  The end result is pretty much free publicity: an ever-growing group of fans who discuss and debate the finer points of the show, comparing theories and interpretations and whatnot.

Paris - are the same . The UK is slow to travel around . It is well linked to the Continent via air . Eurostar links London to Paris and Brussels . The Channel Tunnel and ferries cross the Channel .

UK wise - there are many counties each with their own characteristics - it depends on what you are looking for \ what your approach to life is . Best way to find out is to get a job with plenty of travelling - eg. as a tour bus courier \ tour guide . The counties are cheaper than London .

The UK &amp; the Continent have been hit hard by the economic crisis but things are holding up reasonably well - certainly a lot better than the USA . 

One thing I would suggest is that be prepared to fund yourselves for October November and use this time to get chalet jobs for the skiing season . Once you have got those sorted out do some travelling . However be aware that October onwards is cold , particularly November . Summer holidays basically ends mid September+ . Bar tending etc. jobs in London are also usable for income .

true,finlay_mcwalter,null,null,"Is there any reason to believe that the high street will ever revert to how it was before?

Some segments of retail have moved to the Internet (music, videos, and to some extent books) and aren't coming back. Others (banking, insurance, travel agency) have shifted a proportion of their business to the Internet, and every customer they service there is one that doesn't come into their highstreet place.

Other businesses have moved out to the peripheral retail parks (supermarkets, ironmongery, pet stuff, furniture) and supermarkets have displaced a lot of the business of smaller highstreet retail (butchers, bakers, and a lot of the basic florist, fruit'n'veg, and housewares market), mostly to their retail parks.

That 10% rate is the tip of the iceberg. Look at a typical UK high street and you'll see a lot of pound shops and charity shops which can only afford premises because landlords can't find a full-price tenant.

I don't think the High Street will die altogether. There will always be a demand for personal services like hairdressers, for speciality shops, and for shops that sell stuff the customer needs to see and touch (like clothing and footwear).  But to the extent that the high street does recover, it'll be more noisy chain pubs, more cafes, and more Greggs, not reopened bookshops or record shops or banks or travel agencies.

It won't be as bad in the dense cores of cities, where public transport and walking are convenient and driving and parking are unpleasant.  In the longer term the soul-less private retail park may die, but that'll be over a timescale longer than a single recession. And the overall proportion of retail spending that's done online is surely going to continue to rise for a decade at least.

**edit** That said, it's not all doom and gloom.  One of the great strengths of the traditional British high street is its flexibility.  A given unit can, at various times, have been an undertakers, a cafe, a florist, a lawyer, a bar, a minimarket, and a hairdresser, and the spaces above them can be commercial, residential, or retail spaces. It's that flexibility that keeps the high street in business at all.  The custom-made out of town facilities that have tried to displace it (the big box retail village and the sparse business park of isolated office units in a sea of parking spaces) aren't so easy to retask (you can't put an office in a disused B&amp;Q and there's no prospect of passing trade for shops in a business park).

We had never heard of it before regarding computer science until a rep came round to our school because our ICT teacher had asked for one to see us (the teacher was quite excited because we were the first students in a long time to go for CS and he was just trying to be helpful in helping us decide on a university). The 3 of us thought it would be good to check it out anyway to cover all bases so the rep gave us a date, time and location for an open day thing.

So we all organise to meet up in Derry and walk over to magee on the correct date, time and location as given to us on a formal looking printout w/map. The rep had even called a day before to make sure and confirm all the info. We walk in and look about to each other all with the same look that can only be expressed as ""why is it so quiet and empty?"" but we press on and get into the room number... its empty and gutted. ""okay"" we say ""lets check all the rooms in this building""... we find one person who says that the open day was supposedly yesterday but a funny thing happened... not one single propective student turned up for it and instead they kept coming for their correct times today, a day late. So we show her the printout given to us and we can see that she is confused/pissed off, she thanks us and we leave. Didn;t even know who she was and frankly by that stage we didn't care as we were pissed off too. 

We had all turned 18 so we went to the closest bar and got drunk (might as well do something in Derry besides shop and look about), then we got on the train and went back home with all 3 of deciding unanimously, if not drunkly but with good reason, ""Fuck Magee""",0,1314043108,null,0,false,0,c2ee70i,t3_jpxwq,t1_c2ee70i,t1_c2eb416,1427505249,3,false,northernireland,t5_2qlve,3

The Syfy channel has been slowly but surely culling good, scripted sci-fi out of their lineup in favor of wrestling and reality shows.  The few that remain vary in quality but they all either feel like retreads or they are inconsistent quality wise.

**Key**

* OoS - Out of Stock

Just in case [hp.com](http://www8.hp.com/uk/en/products/tablets/index.html) but it says ""Currently may not be available direct from HP"".

Please tell me of any others/corrections...

* 11:31ish - misco.co.uk - making an anouncement soon according to their [twitter](https://twitter.com/#!/Misco_UK)

* 12:09ish MISCO another tempting tweet from them, brings their website down again!! haha - They're looking into now! lol

* Anyone heard of this company, [miitwo](http://www.miitwo.co.uk/categories.php?category=HP-Touchpad), it says to keep checking but I've never heard of them before, reluctant to put it in the table unless others can confirm. Domain registered to UK individual at London residential address. Hmmm. Their website is now in maintenance mode. 

* 14:00ish Still no news from MISCO - website barely loads, price still ~£290. Might be a good sign that they're not all gone and they're sorting their website out so it will be easier to get one. In hope!

* 15:00ish Staples has reduced accessories for the Touchpad, not sure about others. Premature as most of don't know we have one lol

* 15:37ish PLAY - touchpads not in search, 'old' direct links still work. What's afoot!? But show NONE in stock and no price!!!

* MISCO just tweeted this ""Due to unprecedented demand for the HP Touchpad - our stock has sold out"" WHEN?! I don't like that, the price NEVER changed online. eBay stock now removed. They must have sold them all at full price fro refunds! I can't see of any other way. So much for their ""announcement""

* Misco is OoS. Doesn't look like there's any more to be had today. Unless I come across or anyone else finds something concrete, I will stop for now. Byeee.

* Misco puts out an apology - http://t.co/fNsHNIY - looks like they sold everything over the phone! Damn internet, should have gone with the old skool.

* Amazon just cancelled my order :( 14:26, 24 Aug. Sigh.

* There's always eBay - something about it just hacks me off though. Loads of them on there going for £100-£200. Opportunists. Bleh.

Bale and Lennon didn't play with the flair and pace we saw last season, and quite frankly I don't think Defoe has the acceleration anymore to burst away from pacey defenders.

I don't give a fuck if they are fifteen-year-old trolls having a jolly little jape, I want to see them locked up. you do not make threats to somebody's children just because you don't like them. There are limits to trolling, and this goes beyond those limits.

You do not threaten children for their parents political views. Full stop. You do not excuse people who threaten children. Full stop.

He spent a good amount of time covering the midfield for Kranjcar (whose movement was poor) and Livermore (who made very little impact), and probably half of his long strikes were taken because Defoe wasn't making good runs towards the goal.

the teacher's word in school should be law. allowing kids to argue makes them more resentful and disrespectful of authority. if teachers do the right thing, the kids don't have any legitimate reason to complain.

the lesson students need to learn is that rules are not there to be played with, and that the easiest route to leniency is being trustworthy.

true,Lyme,troughton,Troughton,"Oh man, how to sum up the Doctor? That's hard. And on the one hand, you could say 'well, *which* Doctor' because each one has a different personality. 

But the person as a whole... I accidentally got sucked into a TV tropes link a few days ago (I won't link, to save the productivity of anyone who might read this) and 2 of the tropes come to mind: 

1. Bunny-ears lawyer - the guy who's weird and kooky and maybe clinically insane, but he's so frigging good at what he does that he keeps his job, and

2. Crouching moron, hidden badass (or something like that) - the character who comes off as a total moron/goof but when he gets serious, watch out.

I think a combo of those two tropes can sum up the Doctor, especially 10 and 11, really well. One of the defining moments (to me, at least) for the 10th doctor was in the episode in the second season where they go to that school where they run into Sarah Jane. He has this confrontation with the head bad guy by the pool, and there's just this moment where the mask of the affable, allons-ying Doctor slips and you see this pure, boiling *anger*. It's a sort of moment I'd refer to as 'showing his fangs'. 11's had a few moments like this too - for example, in A Good Man Goes to War, when he makes that comment about good men not needing rules, which is why he has so many.

To me, the Doctor is a walking mass of contradictions. The most obvious example is him being 900+ years old and looking 20something in his current regeneration. But beyond that, he's not a violent man - but he's wiped civilations (including his own) from not just existence, but history itself. He is probably the smartest man in the frigging universe, but he can be incredibly dumb about some things (for example, why *wouldn't* the newlywed couple want to sleep in bunk beds?!).

And there's so much beneath the surface that we rarely even get a glimmer off. The intense loneliness he feels because the lives of almost all his companions are like those of mayflies in comparison. I mean, this loneliness was mentioned back with the *first* Doctor, when he thought Steven was leaving. And the self-loathing - the Dreamlord is the best example, but there are just hints everywhere that he has done so many things that have caused him such guilt and regret that he doesn't like himself very much. Another contradiction: He's an alien from a vastly powerful and ancient race, but he's so human.

He's an incredible role model, someone to aspire to be like, but at the same time he is terrible - not in the 'this sucks' sense of the word, but in the 'shock and awe' sense. If you're on his good side, it's awesome, but if you get on his bad side, holy fuck you're screwed.",0,1314063819,null,0,false,0,c2egt5h,t3_jq8i4,t1_c2egt5h,t3_jq8i4,1427506480,4,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,4

But againts Hearts and United he has seemed a bit lethargic on the ball. Now, he stepped it up after the firsrt 20 minutes against United, and I accept he held the ball well in situations that would probably end a lot worse for a lesser player.

Now, I do think he'd be a fantastic squad player. Someone to play against the bottom team and can get free and score from range. Great. But after seeing him the past 2 games, there's no way he can fill Modric's boots like I've heard some say.

I love his contradictions too. How he's so old yet young. How he's such a good kind peaceful guy yet is the scourge of the universe. Think about what River Song says: ""A man who can turn an army against him at the mention of his name. Doctor. The word for wise man and healer. We get that from you, you know. But if you keep going on the way you have, what might that word come to mean? To the people of the Gamma forests, the word 'Doctor' means mighty warrior"".

He's silly and absentminded but a genius, and even though he never kills he has subjected people to fates worse than death. I love the third Doctor scene in the Mind of Evil where a prison doctor says to the Doctor that if he were a scientist he'd understand. The Doctor get's angry.

If I were a scientist? Let me tell you sir, that I am a scientist! And I have been for several thousands-""

He has to stop himself. Wrings his hands at his sides and storms out. I love that scene.

Yeah TVtropes is dangerous. I like the 'BBC Quarry' trope, about how alien planets were always in that quarry and the show Blake 7 was filming there for an alien planet the same day in different spots. DW and B7 pretty much swapped stories all the time.

I really liked nine though. Maybe he wasn't so ominous looming god of doom and hurt, but he was definitely full of wrath and wasn't afraid to show it. But at the same time he was so happy in those brief moments, he really SHINES. I wish Eccleston's series had had Moffat as the writer.

That's exactly what happened.

I seem to remember that it's believed the limit was not a biological one, but rather a limit put forth by the Timelords themselves, and seeing that there are no more Timelords, it won't affect the Doctor. In my personal opinion, the Valeyard will **not** be making an appearance on New Who.

I see this as having a few sides. Obviously Modric wants to go, and Chelsea want him. Redknapp is probably in Levy's ear, telling him he wants the move to go through as well so he has an extra 30mil to shell out before the window closes. In my opinion, Levy probably sees this as his big, 'stand tall and keep our players' moment for the club. I don't know how likely it is to drive him off of that stance, unless Modric does what Redknapp mentioned and starts to make a nuisance of himself.

true,Cromiell,tardis,TARDIS,"**Just for insurance, I'm putting key parts in spoilers, because I really want to be cautious to any new Whovians, that may just be passing through. :)**

**1: +The Empty Child/The Doctor Dancer, -The Long Game**

""The Empty Child"" &amp; ""The Doctor Dances"" were really mysterious, had a very horror-like theme, introduced Jack, who later became a very important character, and demonstrated The Doctor's brilliance, in situations of need.

""The Long Game"" was not very memorable, did not help develop the story any further, and had a minor character, from the previous episode, who had no place there. Also, there was a plot hole (going to put it in spoilers, in-case people haven't seen it). [The Doctor brings the boy back to the past because he was trying to bring future technology back to his time, yet he left him in ~~2005~~ 2012 with an infospike in his head (the weird thing that comes out of the forehead when someone snaps their fingers), even though that was also future technology.](/spoiler) 

**2: +The Girl In The Fireplace, -Fear Her**

I would also like to acknowledge ""The Christmas Invasion"", which introduces Tennant in a really magnificent and powerful way.

In ""The Girl In The Fireplace"", The Doctor formed a deep relationship with a Madame de Pompadour, which ultimately resulted in a very sad ending, and that's what really made me love this episode.

""Fear Hear"" is a slap-dash story about an alien that can, in theory, do absolutely anything (which is, even for Doctor Who, pretty absurd) and a somewhat uneventful ending.

**3: +Human Nature/The Family of Blood, -42**

I was really tempted to say ""Blink"", however, The Doctor doesn't appear as often as I'd like him to in ""Blink"", but I would still like to give a partial credit to ""Blink"" as being my second favourite (or third favourite, if you count the first as two episodes).

""Human Nature"" &amp; ""The Family of Blood"" shows off some of Tennant's best moments on the show, has some of the best minor characters that I've seen on Doctor Who, gives of an aura of emotion from John Smith's life. It also has one of my all-time favourite endings.

""42"" is really quite a short episode and has some rather large plot holes. Most of the episode doesn't really have anything memorable going on, when The Doctor put on the suit, in order to [protect himself from the sun's energy when going out to save Martha](/spoiler), he could have [went into the vent room and gotten the TARDIS](/spoiler), and he never really explained [how the sun was alive](/spoiler).

**4: +The Doctor's Daughter, -The Fires of Pompeii**

I would also like to point out that I enjoyed ""Silence in The Library"" &amp; ""Forest of The Dead"", but a lot more when watching them after I knew who River Song was (or partially knew).

I loved ""The Doctor's Daughter"" because it rekindles The Doctor's past with his children, that we barely know about, and it was exciting to see another Time Lord, especially when [Donna pointed out that she had two hearts.](/spoiler). It was also inspiring to see The Doctor transform Jenny, from a soldier into a version of himself, essentially.

""The Fires of Pompeii"" were really weird and really confusing (and not the good kind of weird and confusing). I also didn't like that they had [Karen Gillan](/spoiler) playing one of the characters because it really screws up the way Doctor Who flows in my head. Firstly, I don't know how [inhaling the ashes of a rock alien will give you the power to see into the future](/spoiler) (even The Doctor asked that and didn't get an answer, which I find really poor) and secondly, the [energy converter, made out of stone tablets](/spoiler) is really confusing, as well.

**5: +The Eleventh Hour, -The Hungry Earth/Cold Blood**

""The Eleventh Hour"" introduces The Doctor with absolute perfection. He didn't have any tools, and yet, he still managed to save the world and keep it that way from The Atraxi. The ending was one of my all-time favourites and still gives me goosebumps every time I watch it.

""The Hungry Earth"" &amp; ""Cold Blood"" is really deflated. They build up the things inside the earth so much that it's disappointing to see them after, once they're finally on screen, and they ask, but never get an answer to why there are plants growing in the center of the Earth. And there's a weird sequence in the beginning, which shows future Amy and Rory waving to themselves, which I'm not sure they're going to get back to.

**6: +The Doctor's Wife, -The Curse of The Black Spot**

""The Doctor's Wife"" is a really unique look into the mind of [The TARDIS](/spoiler) and The Doctor's excitement when meeting her, and despair, when she's [forced to be silenced, at the end](/spoiler). It was also very creepy seeing [Amy's hallucinations in the halls of The TARDIS, when it was taken over.](/spoiler)

I don't really have that much to say about ""The Curse of The Black Spot."" It wasn't really ""bad."" The plot was solid, the ending was enjoyable, but compared to some of the other episodes in the arc (so far), it just didn't stack up as much as it needed to.

**And again, sorry about the spoilers, it may be a bit annoying, having to hover over them every time you read, but I really didn't want to give away anything to anyone who may not have watched the episodes.**",0,1314086095,null,0,true,0,c2ej5tg,t3_jr3hb,t1_c2ej5tg,t3_jr3hb,1427507589,4,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,4

The Eighth Doctor was so important, because he was such a beautiful transition between Classic and New Who. He was a bit of both in a way even McGann couldn't understand. It's a shame he was on television for *under one hour*.

I think his best story is ""The Chimes of Midnight"", written by Robert Shearman (""Dalek""). Atmospherically, it's as good as ""Blink"" or ""Impossible Astronaut"" and in terms of suspense, there's nothing like it. The final episode of the arc is very strong, but not as strong as the ""Holy shit what the fuck"" three that precede it. It also gives you a little bit on Charley Pollard, one of the coolest *Doctor Who* companions, and one of the few who travels with more than one Doctor (Eighth and Sixth).

The snapshot of Amy's mind, as taken by the Alliance (filled with the contents of the time cracks, having grown up next to one her whole life) contained Rory's entire being; both the mind and the soul. 

As such, from a non-linear time perspective, Rory both existed (as a Nestene Duplicate in 1 A.D) and not-existed (the original Rory from the 21^st Century) at the same time, in the same time-stream. This would probably allow for 'chunks' of Rory's Nestene existence to seep into his original time line through the cracks, thus allowing for the existence of the photo in Amy's house, despite the Leadworth Rory never having existed at all.

If you go with mikel over ramires tgen lampard gets a much heavier workload with a bigger box to box duty. If  we go with ramires then were missing our best defensive rock in midfield, but that could actually work against a team like norwich. The best option there might be lampard as holding mid making late runs, playmaking from deep. Then ramires on the right and mata in the more advanced position on the left.

What i would like to see actually is a 4-2-3-1 lampard-ramires malouda-mata-anelka torres.

However from what ive heard avb told mata he was bringing him in to play in the 4-3-3. I think the best option might be to have mata take maloudas spot, then we can bring on malouda and drogba when we need a more direct physical approach. Cant wait for sturridge to be back though. And luiz too

&gt;In 2007, AI stated that it reports disproportionately on relatively more democratic and open countries.[11] AI's intention is not to produce a range of reports such that the number of reports on a country correlates precisely with the number and severity of its human rights abuses. Instead, its aim is: (a) to document what it can, to (b) produce pressure for improvement. These two factors skew the number of reports towards more open and democratic countries, because information is more easily obtainable, these countries have usually made strong claims and commitments to uphold human rights, and their governments are more susceptible to public pressure.

true,uglybellyboy,null,null,"Hey,

What type of Forensic Science is your friend doing? The thing about Forensic Science as a degree is the fact that it is highly saturated at the moment.

What this means is, of course, that for every job there will be loads of graduates. The best thing to do is specialise in a certain science field, and then go onto further specialise in a Forensic-related field (this is a bit late for your friend though).

But to give your friend some advice:

* Try to get as much actual work-experience as possible. 
* Work-experience was a part of my degree, and it was hugely beneficial
* Most graduate nowadays don't have industry experience, which severely limits their chances.

* Tell your friend to keep in mind that there are loads of different Forensic Science companies, not just the FSS. Tell her to check out the websites of these companies and apply directly. Even if there are no positions advertised, I would advise sending your CV anyway in case something comes up (that's what I did).

* I did my Undergrad (BSc) back home in Ireland, and then did an MSc here in the UK (apologies for being secretive about the Unis, but I don't like giving out self-identifiable details!)

So to conclude, tell your friend to try her best to get work experience, and then after she obtains the degree, if possible, to undergo an MSc, as this will give her much more options. (although with tuition fees, this will be difficult). 

Also, tell her to keep in mind the option of volunteering work, which will give her experience. This all looks great on a CV, and in no time she will have the interview offers rolling in.
