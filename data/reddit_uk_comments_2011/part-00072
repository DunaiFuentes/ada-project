true,liverman,lfc68,null,"Okay I'll provide strategy from the perspective of the Liverpool team. 

Starting from the defenders. Carragher, vice-captain, can be seen pretty much as a limited defender. Meaning that his main role is to stay deep and defend. No attacking mentality at all, seeing that Carra can't really score goals. 

Unlike Agger, who is pretty much allowed to bombard forward, if he sees the opportunity to do so. It leaves a hole in the back, but with a sweet left foot available, sometimes [it can be useful.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNAAfP7ed8A&amp;feature=related) 

We'd all prefer Skrtel to stay back and defend, his ball striking skills aren't as good. But he does provide a threat during corners. Most central defenders go up and attack during corners, as they're usually the best in the team at heading.

For the fullbacks (the defenders at the flanks), we have Glen Johnson on the right and [Jose Enrique](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Fzu4W01qro) at the left. These guys have the option to attack. They're both good with their feet, and fast, so they provide attacking options down the flanks. But of course they're decision making has to be pretty good, seeing as they would leave a huge hole gaping at the back flanks, prone to counter attacks and all. 

Now to midfield. Firstly we have the playmaker role like Stevie G and Charlie Adam. Stevie's much more versatile, able to take up nearly every position in the midfield. They're the ones that usually look out for those magical killer balls to provide the strikers. Or spread out the play to other players in space. Basically the creative outlet of the team.

Then there's the holding midfielder, defensive midfielder/anchor man in Lucas Leiva, or Jay Spearing. They're [pretty good at tackling](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XEPLjA09APs) and marking. Strength is also a key factor. Usually they slow down the play, both when the opposition attacks, and when we attack (to regroup more people in the front)

To the wings now, there's the natural wingers like Downing (on the left), who crosses the ball in for Carroll to head in. Wingers tend to be the paciest of the lot, high level of trickery in them too. Then there's inside forwards like Kuyt, or Maxi. Not natural wide players (Not too much of the trickery, or crossing ability), but they attack down the sides, but cut inside to help with the finish. 

Players like Bellamy would cut inside WHILE with the ball. Bellamy's a right-footer, but he would play on the left. Cutting inside with the ball allows him to shoot at an angle. Should Bellamy choose to cross, he would have to turn around and transfer the ball to his favoured right foot. So there's too choices there. (Same applies to Downing, if you see that Kenny has moved him to the right flank). Tactics like this mean that the team would have 4 strikers instead of the usual 2 (IF we play 4-4-2)

Finally to the strikers. Firstly Andy Carroll. Big lanky player. Slow, but with a decent amount of strength. These guys don't weave around defences. But they receive long balls, usually laying it off to a fellow player to provide the finish, if their balance isn't right (not facing the goal). Pushing away defenders, shooting when the opportunity is right etc. Not the prettiest of positions, but it's effective if used right. In my opinion, strikers like him play best alone up front. Midfielders providing the right ball, and with inside forwards assisting. So he's there to ward off the central defenders with the strength, leaving the midfielders with space to attack.

[Luis Suarez](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xblKbr6kQoM) is the kind of striker that defenders would hate to meet. Fast(ish), loads of flair and trickery. Beats the opponent and always aims to pass the ball to the back of the net. Precise finishing is the key here. Usually used in the 2nd striker role. Meaning, behind the target man, so that the target man can lay-off the ball to him.

Then there's poachers, like Kuyt if used in the striker role. Key words here are **right place, right time**. Bloody good positioning is important. Most goals end up as tap-ins, but hell it delivers the goods so we ain't complaining. (Look at the Luis Suarez video above. Kuyt's role as a striker can be seen there)

Okay that's a really condensed version of it. Heh. Hope it helps!",0,1320651186,null,0,false,0,c2xqjt6,t3_m38xe,t1_c2xqjt6,t3_m38xe,1427841975,19,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,19

true,dixonofdockgreen,null,null,"Hello. 

Trespass unless ""aggravated trespass"" is not actually a criminal offence. Trespassing in Tesco is no different to Trespassing in someone's house, although more analogous is their drive way. Imagine that someone comes onto your drive, it is publicly accessible and rights of access are implied. You ask them to leave, you then warn them to leave but they don't. At this point you could use reasonable force to remove them from your drive way. If you tell them don't come back and they do, you can then pretty much use reasonable force to remove them again but giving much less warning. If it was you're private property then harassment could well be applicable but that irrelevant. 

The above scenario is exactly the same as say a supermarket but they have a security team to deal with it. An open place (eg shopping centre, supermarket and so on are really no different). They will then be able to remove you. Provided you do not commit any criminal offences then the police will have no involvement unless the security phone police. Police officers generally in that scenario will be reluctant to themselves physically remove you and allow the security staff to do it and just stand there to prevent a breach of the peace.  They could seek a civil injunction against you to prevent you coming back but that really is about it and I've never known them to bother, even with prolific shoplifters. 

The long and short of it is bar physically removing you there isn't a lot they can do if you're not committing any actual crime. Burglary for example is where a person trespasses in a building or part and then steals (or commits criminal damage or GBH). Before the law changed if someone broke into a house and then raped an occupant the offence was burglary. 

The law doesn't actually change depending on where the trespass changes (one exception being if they intend to basically set up camp there under the criminal justice and public order act) depending on where it is. It remains a civil issue. 

I've only once physically removed someone on account of them trespassing. That was from a charity shop where there were two elderly ladies who were obviously not going to be able to remove the chap themselves.

You mentioned you're lake of a college education so here are some points to note that you might not be aware of:

* You can get free further education, A levels (probably what you'd consider a High school Diploma) which can get you into a university.

* The university system is changing next year and the fees will be going up to around £9k a year for which you'll get a loan to pay off. The good news is you don't pay this off unless you're earning a minimum amount after you leave uni and after a certain amount of time it gets written off. If you take a part time job and you get a maintenance loan/grant (this depends on your circumstances) you can live comfortably until you have a degree; depending on your qualification you might find difficulty getting work after you finish uni though.

* Apprenticeship schemes are a great way to learn ""on the job"" experience in an industry. E.g. if you wanted to become a mechanic or something like that. The pay for these generally isn't great for the first year and it probably wouldn't be enough to survive off on its own.

Do not worry about claiming benefits or ""taking"" from the state. It is in the interests of any human being to take the opportunities that they are given to better their own quality of life. Not taking these opportunities is up to you, but, in a way, you're insulting those that don't have them and worsening your quality of life out of fear of upsetting some values that you don't have to hold.

Live the life that you want to live; if you're not hurting anyone else and you're not doing anything illegal you are free to be whatever you want. These are some of the values I hold and that our country has struggled to achieve over centuries. The potential of your ideas, knowledge, labour and experience can offer this country vastly outweighs anything you take in benefits or while you're on the dole.

&gt;You're so quick to deny others of their rights and dictate what others should or shouldn't do


you're so quick to find out about your rights but dont care too much about your duties .. this is what is wrong with society today .. you have no moral right to get job seekers allowance .. you have a moral duty to first contribute to the system before taking from it

but I guess you dont care about any of that stuff .. because it is your god given right to come to the uk and claim benefits ..

a snippet:

&gt;A dangerous byproduct of the welfare state and the growth of government is a profound attitudinal change in society which makes people demand more and more and contribute less and less. This transformation of the social psyche has taken place imperceptibly to the point that it unconsciously pervades the entire society. The preoccupation with rights (particularly state created social and economic rights) has become an obsession. Although this is not an intrinsic evil, the pursuit of rights becomes self defeating when it is unaccompanied by the commitment to duties. The pressures exercised by interest groups have become the dominant feature of the modern era. These demands come not only from the poor and the underprivileged, but also from privileged academic, bureaucratic, social and business groups. At the same time there is a deafening silence on the question of individual responsibility.

He's grown up with it around but not in an emotional scary way, so it's just a thing to him. He was nearly 3 before he ever reacted to anything as scary. I always watch with him so can gauge his comfort - with some new episodes he'll watch from inside my t-shirt, peeking out the neckhole, but he doesn't usually want it turned off. He doesn't have nightmares. Sometimes he doesn't want to watch a particular episode as it's ""too scary"" but they aren't the ones I'd expect. He loves the Battle of Canary Wharf, Sontarans, Angels, Vashta Nerada - the one he is most frightened of is The Doctor's Wife. I haven't let him watch Night Terrors as that's too close to home. 

It may help that because he's grown up around the show, he has ultimate faith in the Doctor. He used to be terrified of fireworks and last November we went to Cardiff to see Matt Smith, Arthur Darvill and Karen Gillan switch on the Christmas lights. Ben was in heaven except that right afterwards there were some fireworks. He was able to calm down, though, because the Doctor was there and he trusts the Doctor. My parents are theologians and shake their heads in despair at the pseudo-religion I'm raising my child in. :-}

I think it's the principle they found in Doctor Who in the '60s - aliens somewhere else is entertaining; aliens at home is scary. The ones with domestic settings are scarier for him.

It turns into a cycle of, ""I don't want to go to school, so I best be naughty to get kicked out"", really quite counter-productive.

But from my understanding, schools are no longer allowed to exclude students, which a big positive - as it forces the school to resolve the issue in the best educational means possible, but with tory cuts, I guess special support and x number of children will be ignored.

I was a Doctor Who fan before the new series.  Heck, before there was even such a thing as the World Wide Web.  So when I discovered reddit a couple of years ago, and finally joined, I was excited to discover there was an entire section devoted to Doctor Who.  I assumed it would be filled with discussions of things like past episodes, characters, technology, theories, etc.  While there is a bit of this sort of thing here, this subreddit is dominated by things like this: pictures that have little to nothing to do with the show.

I'm sorry, but I really don't care if you dressed up like the Doctor, or you made a Tardis cake, or you put a bowtie on your dog because ""bowties are cool"".  This submission is a picture of a cover of a book about an event that one episode of the series was based on.  Seriously?  That is an extremely tenuous relationship to the show.

I fully expect to be downvoted to oblivion for this, and I know none of you know who I am and won't miss me when I'm gone, but I had to get this off my chest before I unsubscribed.

true,dre134,null,null,"I recently started following soccer as well so I know the desire to learn more. The best advice I can give is to watch/play as much as you can. Playing is the best because it will help you learn positioning, skill, formations, strategy and roles of various players. Soccer is a very unique sport because there is so much variation around the world, i.e. English (Premier League) style depends on the team really. Because there are many different countries represented on all of the sides (teams), there isn't really one style that dominates. Most of the time though, the English style is somewhat brutish and physical. Often, there will be attractive build up play with incredible goals scored while there are also incredible individual goals scored by some of the more skilled players. Spanish (La Liga) style is very possession oriented using short passing triangles, Italian (Serie A) style is to defend and use the counter attack, German (Bundesliga) style is all about efficiency and scoring tap-ins and short goals. These are the top leagues in the world so learning about them will help the most. 
Like I said, just watch and play as much as you can. Learning the players and the names will also help you to learn roles and positioning so that will benefit you. I find that reading match reports and reading what the managers say about the matches will also help you to learn about the strategies and tactics employed by said managers. 
Hope this helps and it's great to hear that soccer is getting more popular in the US!",0,1320690034,null,0,false,0,c2xu5y3,t3_m38xe,t1_c2xu5y3,t3_m38xe,1427843765,2,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,2

It is my belief that a DM relies on intelligence and willpower more than strength to perform their role. While a strong DM can easily push other players off the ball, the more intelligent attackers will easily be able to read the incoming tackle and earn themselves fouls. An intelligent DM can anticipate passes, mark runners, and close down dangerous counterattacks without relying on his strength. I personally think that Lucas and Spearing are good defensive midfielders for this exact reason, as neither are particularly strong or large, but display a very astute understanding of play and awareness of their surroundings. Lucas more-so than Spearing at this time. 

Willpower I would say is a given for the DM role. A strong-willed and persistent defensive-mid will not stop closing down and pressuring the opposition, regardless of trickery, failure to land a tackle, or a bad call from the referee.

true,JustifiedTrueBelief,lfc68,,"[Liverman](http://www.reddit.com/r/LiverpoolFC/comments/m38xe/starting_to_get_into_football_but_would_like_to/c2xqjt6) talked about particular players and positions, so I'll talk about more general strategy and style, partly through allusion to American football (I'm American and decently well versed in each, so comparing the two comes pretty easily. From here on I'll refer to them as football and soccer respectively).

Okay, so you know how there's lots of ways to play football? I'll just kind of generalize by conference to make it a little simpler. There's the classical Big Ten style, based on strong defense, the power run game, and play-action passing. There's the Big XII style of a terrifying passing offense and somewhat weaker defense based around just scoring more points. The Pac 12 has traditionally been a pro-style so-called West Coast style conference, spreading the field and having a balanced running and passing attack. The SEC is a lot like the Big Ten, with emphasis on crushingly powerful defenses and strong running attacks, and a big emphasis is put on team speed. Some of these are specific to formation as well. For instance, two teams could use the same system, option run, but one (e.g. Navy or Georgia Tech) could use the wishbone option, and the other (e.g. Oregon or West Virginia) could use spread option, which is totally different but based upon the same core tenet of misdirection and run opening up the pass.

Soccer is much the same way. Various teams and managers have lots of different styles and formulae to play the type of soccer they think is best for their club and their players. So you have a team like Barcelona, based upon consummate skill and flawless passing, being greedy with possession as a form of attack and defense. On the other hand, there are teams like Stoke City, who play a very tight style based upon conservative and resilient defense and big strong attackers who can win possession off the long balls played out of defense. Then there is the style Liverpool plays traditionally which is pass-and-move, based around quick ball movement and scything runs into open space in the opposition's defense. There are teams like Real Madrid and Arsenal, who both tend to play the possession game because they are usually far superior to their opponents, but are truly at their best on the counter-attack, where they can use their pace and vision to punish any mistake by the retreating defenders. Then there are the teams like Man City and Man U, who pretty much just do everything well.

A team's formation also has a lot to do with how they play. The ""standard"" modern formation is 4 defenders (2 center backs, two fullbacks that push forward to help when attacking), 3-5 midfielders (almost always at least one defensive midfielder to help the center backs), and 1-3 strikers. There are a huge amount of permutations of this formula though, usually based around what the team. I would say the 4-4-2 is the traditional attack-minded English soccer formation. Two central midfielders, one who holds in midfield and one who pushes forward to help in attack, and two wingers, whose job it is to stay wide and use their pace and/or skill to create opportunities and space for the two strikers in the middle. You can have a 4-3-3, which usually consists of one defensive midfielder, two attacking midfielders, two wingers, and one central striker. Some teams, like Chelsea for instance, often play a 4-3-3 with three strikers up front and no traditional wingers.

One formation that has become extremely popular over the past decade or so is the 4-2-3-1, which is a slightly more defensive and flexible 4-3-3. It consists of two defensive/holding midfielders, three attacking midfielders, and a lone striker, but the roles are very fluid. The CAM (center attacking midfielder) can easily be a player like a Xavi, playing precise passes through the defense, or a Rooney, a deep-lying striker who often helps out in defense, or a Messi, who can get the ball at the center circle and dribble his way to a goal, or any number of other roles. The same can be said with the outside attacking mids. You could put a Walcott or Bale there, so he can just use blinding pace to get behind the defense, or again a dribbler like Messi, or a player like Iniesta or Nasri, who can use possession and interplay with his teammates to get into dangerous positions, or a Nani or Ronaldo, who combine ridiculous ball skills and speed to get past defenders, or a Beckham, who sits out wide and can play jaw-dropping long range passes into the box, or a poacher like Maxi and Kuyt who are always running and always trying to be in a dangerous position.

Finally, soccer is a team sport, but it is one of the most reliant on individuals. On your average football team, changing one player won't usually affect the way the team plays much at all (except maybe the quarterback). The coach calls the plays, the players do what the play tells them. Soccer is much different. It's continuous and there are almost no specifically trained plays (this almost always only happens on free kicks and corners), and so the manager has MUCH MUCH less control over the play of the team. Yes, he/she sets up the formation and general plan and can give specific instructions from the sidelines or at halftime, but all the decision making is down to the players. This makes each individual player's style and skill extremely important. 

Let me make it more explicit. Take your standard Cover 2 football defense. You have two safeties sitting deep, each giving support for deeps passes on their half of the field. It doesn't really matter if the safety prefers to have tight coverage and go for interceptions or likes to react and put huge hits on receivers to break up the pass. As long as he breaks up the pass, he succeeds and you go on to the next play. However, it makes a HUGE difference in soccer if your midfielder is a long passer or a dribbler or a defensive player or an attacking player, and even more if your striker is big and strong or fast and skillful. The players you have almost necessarily defines the way the team plays, because most players are at their best in a very specific role and struggle if they are in a different role. This is why there are so many posts here and in r/soccer about transfer rumors, who should play where and why, what formation teams should play, and so many more minute details. That stuff is so ridiculously important in soccer, because taking out one player and replacing him with another or moving a player from one area of the field to another can change the entire style of a team.

This is just my amateur analysis of the two games, and there are many more examples I could use, but I think that's a decent overview. 

TL;DR: There are lots of diverse strategies to win a football game, and it's the same with soccer. You can play with fluid passing or suffocating defense or counter-attacking, etc. The formation chosen also matters a lot in how a team is going to play, and the individual players on the field are extremely important to the way a team plays.",0,1320693734,null,0,true,0,c2xuskc,t3_m38xe,t1_c2xuskc,t3_m38xe,1427844048,2,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,2

&gt;an alien/different perspective

That would defeat the point of there being a companion though. The role of companion has two main purposes: 

1) To be a relatable surrogate for the audience. What I mean by relatable surrogate is, the companion needs to be a character the audience can easily put themselves in the place of. This usually means appearing human, even if they are alien. Also, they have to ask the questions that will give the audience the necessary information to relay the full story, or at least as much as the writers want to give away.

2) The companion has to be a filter for the Doctor's interactions with the audience. That is, the Doctor has to interact with the companion in a manner that the companion, and by proxy the audience, would understand. An alien companion means that he'd have to interact with them at least partly in an alien manner. 


As for young and attractive, well, this *IS* a TV show. You don't get high ratings for a TV show with old, ugly people in the starring role. That's partly another role of the companion, to provide fresh, attractive faces regardless of the actor playing the Doctor to draw in more viewers.",0,1320695141,null,0,false,0,c2xv0lv,t3_m3hog,t1_c2xv0lv,t3_m3hog,1427844149,2,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,2

the problem with traders however, is that what a good one does is use his own understanding of the market to make profits, all he needs is a chart software package, an execution platform and a decent internet connection.

My favorite is definitely 8. He has a sort of young atmosphere about him, with a certain joyful spontaneous outlook on things, but still retains a sense of wisdom, and I think McGann does this better than any other actors for the show (and his audios are my favorite Who stories). He also has a bit of Victorian influences, in his clothing choices and his manner of speaking, that really appeals to me. 10 is a close second, for many of the same reasons I like 8, he's got that ""ancient Time Lord, seen it all"" air about him, as well as that eccentric, spontaneous, improvisational way of handling tough situations. 

From here it gets fuzzy. I'm still in the process of getting into the classics, but I've seen at least one serial of each Doctor. I have to say my next favorite is a tie between 3 and 5, for very different reasons. 3 has the old wise man thing going for him, like how I feel about 1, but has a nice balance between that and goofiness. 5 is just awesome and fun, and I think was the first to really capture the ""young"" aspects of the character. I should mention 4, I suppose, seeing as how he was more or less the quintessential Doctor. He kind of falls into the category with 3 and 5, the three of them are all equally great for different reasons. I really don't know where to put 11 right now, though. I like what Smith is doing with the character, and 11 would fall somewhere in the 3, 4, 5 fuzziness. It's hard to put them all in an ordered list of favorite to least favorite.

I respect the hell out of 1, and I love how he set up the character to be a venerable but cranky and stubborn old man, who's still young at heart. I always feel like I can see Hartnell's influences in each and every Doctor. 

I haven't seen enough of 2, 6, or 7 to really comment on them, but from what I've seen I don't dislike any of them.

*edit: What the hell, I forgot 9! I guess I would lump him up with my clusterfuck of 3rd place options, he did a fantastic job of setting up the darker aspects of Tennant and Smith, and was a great introduction to the new Who. He played the PTSD Doctor very solidly. He was actually my first Doctor, saw him when the show first aired, and it was because of his acting that I kept watching the show which has now easily become my favorite show on television, so he's always gonna have a grand association in my memory.

If that doesn't sound too too flaky, think of me as somebody who had been following Redknapp with quite a bit of curiosity since the Portsmouth days.

Add on top of all of this that I was up a LOT with my first kid, so, I'd be rocking a kid back to sleep with English football replays on mute.

And... bit by bit, all of these things started to intersect, and, I really can't name the date it happened, but there was this occurrence, over and over again, hearing announcement after announcement of one of my favorites from international competition making it onto the roster, and screaming: ""Holy shit, *HE'S* playing for Spurs now too?!?!""

Having no idea about any teams I decided to follow them and they became my favorite team. Luckily for me I had access to most serie A and EPL games so it wasnt a challenge to watch them. In the mean time I began watching a lot of EPL. Of course you have your Arsenals and Chelseas and Man U's and Liverpools that most American EPL fans like but for me, having no ties to anything in England, I just simply picked a random team and went with it. Watching Spurs games was fun to me and I liked their style. Less importantly I had a really awesome teacher whose last name was Tottenham and he was from the UK as well so I guess that made it all the better. But I watched and fell in love with the team and have followed them since. Although my overall favorite team is AC Milan, Spurs are still my favorite EPL team and lately have been a lot more fun to watch these past two years especially. (It also made the CL last year an interesting event up however my 0-0 tie fantasy didnt happen).

* 
Born and raised in north London, went to uni at Imperial (still there in fact), work in Bedford for this year, but still living in north London. So born and bread really.
* Came here from r/soccer to get more specific news.
* Spurs fan from birth, as my dad and uncle were already season ticket holders for at least 10 years.
* Season ticket holder. I sit with my uncle and dad in the paxton road end right behind the goal.
* Favourite player - whoar, erm, probably Ledley. The guy has such brilliant quality. If he was fit all the time, would have replaced rio and terry in the england squad a long time ago.
* Favourite game of the year - I guess this season it would have to be the arsenal game obviously. But in recent memory, the Inter home game. There are no words to describe the feeling of being there. It's a fucking shame they raised the loyalty points for the Real away game after I bought flights and that I couldn't get time off Uni to go to milan with my uncle....
* Oh and since going out with my SO (who was a part time spurs fan before, the kind of person who would notice scores but not really support or watch) I have made her want to watch every game. I have taken her to games and bought her a shirt. In fact she was in Canada last year for a year abroad, the day she came back was the chelsea home game. What was I to do.... Get her a ticket for the game of course

How did I come to find r/coys: I’ve been a lurker on reddit for a few years and r/soccer was one of my go to subreddits. Stumbled upon this subreddit by simply clicking on the list of all soccer related subreddits.

How long as a supporter: I’ve been playing soccer my whole life, and when Fox Soccer Channel finally became widespread on the early 2000’s, I watched as much EPL as I could. I enjoy the way Tottenham plays, especially when they have Defoe and Lennon on the field and they just sprint around everyone. But last year, after the infamous Inter game where Bale went nuts and posterized Maicon, I became a Tottenham fan.  TL;DR – I love the style of play Tottenham uses

Where/How I watch Spurs: Good ol’ Fox Soccer Channel (and when given a free preview weekend - Fox Soccer Plus). My lifelong dream is to go to England and do a Stadium tour over a couple of weeks and catch as many EPL games I can. 

Favorite Player: I have many, but Bale holds a special place. Modric is a close second. 

Favorite Match: Maicon getting a clinic from Bale. 9-1 decimation of Wigan also a favorite

true,[deleted],null,null,"You can't get bogged down in statistics when you talk about football, maybe the statistic approach works with baseball, but football is a totally different approach. If you blindly follow stats they will lead you to believe Adam is a better player than the likes of Modric, as he has a better goal to game ratio. Also with your stats Maxi played a lot less minutes than any of the other players you mentioned, such as VDV and Kuyt, who are both a lot better players.

However, I did see his argument for not playing Maxi, and it wasn't the strongest of arguments. But I am on his side, my first reason for not playing Maxi is he is a massive shit out, against any of the teams with a bit of menace about them (e.g Stoke, Blackburn, Wolves any of the newly promoted sides) he is scared of the tackle, which has always made it hard to warm to him, in my eyes, if he isn't happy to put his body on the line for the team, why should he get the privilage of wearing the shirt.

He also tactically, he tends to cut inside too often, I prefer my wingers to hug the line, especially as in recent weeks we have been rather narrow, mostly down to only have wingers on the left side not the right. As both Kelly and Henderson where trained as central players.

Another point to my anti Maxi argument is that he isn't as strong in front of goal as everyone on reddit seems to think, he took his chances well at the end of the last season, but before that there was lots of occassions when he bottled it in front of goal, either putting in a weak finish, or over thinking it and not even shoting in the end.

The only argument I can think of for playing Maxi, is its not working out well for anyone else down the right side at the minute, and everyone in the squad deserves a chance to prove themselves, before we pass judgement.

I generally like to think that the Doctor was half human because his DNA structure was still stabilizing into Time Lord form.

You missed the other part- the Doctor said he can regenerate into different species in that movie and he mentions a mother and a father. This was to make him more relatable a character- stupid. But I don't mind him being able to change species, it would explain why the Doctor was half human. It also explains how Romanadvoratrelundar regenerates into a blue alien.

We could also say that the Doctor regenerated half human that time, not all the time though. No biggie. He has parents, that could be biological or figurative, he could mean that his mother was a carrier for a potential regenerate-into-human gene.

true,Geofferic,essex,"Bloody Barkingside, Wot!","The primary causes were Britain returning to the gold standards at *pre-WWI* parities (insane) and the US Federal Reserve massively shrinking the monetary supply.

Further, due to central banking choices that created unrealistic interest rates and an over-abundance of cash, there was a massive bubble that popped.  This is when the US Federal Reserve then massively shrunk the money supply *below* the levels it should have been when they had inflated it, thus making everything phenomenally worse.  Then FDR made it illegally to privately own gold, which then caused a yo-yo because then there was a big jump in money supply - *again* higher than it should have been.

At this time, the US Dollar was on the gold standard at a 40% rate (technically, it is Constitutionally required to be on the gold standard now, but it's not) and as I mentioned above, the UK pound had recently returned to the gold standard but at ridiculous rates.  Because both governments were printing money, they were having to acquire gold, but there was a shortage of gold (hence FDR made it illegal to own it).  So in the US and UK there was too much money, then way too little, then too much briefly, then too little again, then everyone scrapped the gold standard and flooded the market with cash.

What exacerbated all of this was *government policies* encouraging banks to loan money on 10% margin (mind you, this is the *exact same thing* that forked the banks recently - *exactly*!).

Now a lot of folks think that flooding the market with cash stopped the great depression, but this is a silly thought.  What actually stopped the depression was stopping the fluctuation of the value of currency.  So basically, by flooding the markets, the money became of so little value that it was for practical purposes stabilized.

The problem was never the gold standard, tho, but rather that *everyone* was on it and so there simply wasn't enough gold to go around.  Countries on the silver standard essentially had no depression, other than the knock-on effects of the world wide economic collapse, but you'd be surprised how well they did.  In fact, you can pin the success on China today to the fact that they were on the silver standard at that time.",0,1320704246,null,0,false,0,c2xwmge,t3_m3ccs,t1_c2xwmge,t1_c2xwg5f,1427844906,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

I´ve just been looking at the Wikipedia page (this is the extent of my expertise), and you seem to halfway between the Austrian economists (too much money before the crash) and the Monetarists (lack of action by the Fed leading to an overhasty contraction in money supply). I note part of Friedman´s argument: 

&gt; Friedman argued that the downward turn in the economy, starting with the stock market crash, would have been just another recession.[25] **The Federal Reserve allowed some large public bank failures – particularly that of the New York Bank of the United States – which produced panic and widespread runs on local banks, and the Federal Reserve sat idly by while banks collapsed. He claimed that, if the Fed had provided emergency lending to these key banks, or simply bought government bonds on the open market to provide liquidity and increase the quantity of money after the key banks fell, all the rest of the banks would not have fallen after the large ones did, and the money supply would not have fallen as far and as fast as it did.**[26] With significantly less money to go around, businessmen could not get new loans and could not even get their old loans renewed, forcing many to stop investing. This interpretation blames the Federal Reserve for inaction, especially the New York branch.[27]

Secondly, the argument that his goal scoring came against inferior teams, were often tap-ins, due to defensive errors, etc is a bit unfair, as if you were to apply those conditions to other players an teams you would be dismissing the legitimacy of 90% of all goals in the Premier League. Suarez has scored offside twice this season and at least twice due to poor defending. It's a big part of the game. Take are of any chance you get. 

I do agree that Maxi is not a true winger, and I consider him more a replacement for Adam, who is just as great, if not more of, a defensive liability. But even out on the wing, his ability to come inside is more of an asset than a liabilty, as I see it. Both last season an this one, we have been tragically ineffective at wide / crossing play, despite acquiring Downing, considered one of the best crossers in the league and Carroll, considered the best young centre forwards and aerial threats. The majority of our goals have come via the middle, where Suarez can get the ball with his back to goal and do what he does best. With that in mind, Maxi offers far more than you seem to suggest.

true,[deleted],null,null,"I am not completely dismissing stats, I just don't think its should be your first port of call when assessing a player, since as you obviously know, some players effects on the game look poor when put down into statistics. for example Lucas's foul count, even though it looks bad, the majority of the fouls are in nothing areas with very little cost to the team, and it helps slow the tempo, which suits us. Yet the stat just makes him look like a dirty player, which I would argue he isn't. The stat arguement could go on for days so...

But back to Maxi, I just don't think he is overly suited to the premier league, which as an assessment you may say I am being very harsh, but I truly believe to be a fair comment. This is mostly down to the fact Maxi has never been one for putting a shift in for the team, he is more of a flair player, whom if you give the ball could create something special, or just completely waste posession.

Another aspect of his game I think he lack considering he is a winger is the ability to take on a defender, he never truly looks comfortable when it comes to get past a man, maybe its because he isn't as quick as he used to be, or he is lacking confidence, but he never seems to look to want to beat the defender, more look for a easy way out.

But don't get me wrong, I would probably lash him in for a couple of games myself at the moment, but only as he probably the best of a bad bunch, when it comes to right sided midfielders, that and I am always happy to be proven wrong by a player that I have as good as written off.

true,Geofferic,essex,"Bloody Barkingside, Wot!","As it's 1 am, and I am being called to bed, I will have to pass on digging up the relevant UK legislation.

I will briefly address the credit card restrictions as theft issue.

If I loan you 100 quid and you promise to pay me back at 10 quid a month for 13 months, then I end up with a profit of 30 quid.

Now in 10 months' time I can make another 100 quid loan to another person.  Same exact conditions.

That means that in months 11, 12 and 13 I bring in 20 quid, for 60 quid, and 4 months later I have another 100 quid to loan out.

You can see how this rolls until I am making many, many loans all at once.

Credit cards are lines of credit.  Any money on a credit card is a loan.  The interest rate reflects the amount of profit a company can make on a given 'loan' over a given period of time.

Let's say the guv stepped in to our little 100 quid loan.  They said that you should only have to pay back 8 quid per month *and* that you should not have to pay back more than a total of 128 quid.  Seems minor and probably more ""fair"" to you, no doubt.  

However, not only does that ""steal"" 2 quid from me, but it puts off when I can make the next loan to 13 months from 10.  Now that is a significant change from what I had expected and planned on.

So remember that this is actually a line of credit, not a fixed loan.  So I told you a year ago that you can have that 100 quid anytime you want.  Then, in month 6, I told a new client that they can have a 100 quid line of credit, too.  They start using it, but their use is only 20 quid per month, paying back 2 quid per 20.  I feel pretty safe.  Then in month 7, the new regs come into effect.  Now I start sweating since I'm not taking in so much to cover what I said I could cover before.  Then in month 11 my client says they want the balance of the line of credit - and I either have to get the money from somewhere or tell them no, since you are no longer paying me back and my predicted rate *and neither are they* on the money they had borrowed.

Now, imagine you have 100,000 loans like this and they average at 3000 quid a piece.  And your monthly per loan revenue went from 80 quid to 50 quid, and your total paid-off profit went from 1500 quid to 1000 quid.  All of that times 100,000.

That is theft. 

Now, mind you, I don't disagree that many credit card rates were out of control.  They were.  However, I believe the underlying problem is that other markets are over-regulated which creates the need for these lines of credit in the first place.  Which is typical - guv creates a distortion in the market with regulation, then tries to fix that distortion with other regulation, which in turn creates more distortion, until the market is so convoluted and incapable of reacting properly to environmental changes that nobody can predict with any degree of certainty what is going to happen.

That snowballed into always picking Spurs while playing FIFA, to knowing the entire line-up (I still miss the 'ole trusty Steed).

I have found boundless enjoyment in watching my Lilywhites.  My favorite Spurs memories to date include Woody's header against Chelsea to win the Carling Cup (I could still kill Didier Zokora for that game), Steed Malbranque's celebration after scoring that goal against Arsenal, Berbatov netting 4 goals in a rediculous 6-4 win over Reading, Danny Fucking Rose drilling a bomb against Arsenal a year or so ago...and almost being brought to tears by the Spurs fans chanting when news got out about Jol being sacked.

After spending a significant amount of time on their websites, it became apparent that neither had any physical stock of anything suitable at their local stores, or anywhere within a 10 mile radius that wasn't a ridiculously annoying drive to get to.

Best Buy in Thurrock did have stock, so I reserved a monitor and drove to the store. Despite the place being almost empty of actual customers, nobody had bothered to fetch the monitor and leave it at the collection desk. The staff were basically having some kind of social gathering in the laptop section and didn't seem inclined to actually assist a paying customer (i.e., just give me the damn monitor that I reserved, or SUATMM).

true,slightlyKiwi,cyberman,Cyberperson,"OKay, since most of you appeared to have missed the point.

The Master used the Archangel Satellite network to extend his mind control abilities (an advanced form of Time Lord psychic ability) across the world.  He did this by hooking the Tardis's telepathic circuitry into the network.  

The Doctor was able to use this to allow Martha, Jack and himself to become 'invisible' by rigging a booster onto the Tardis keys that each of them carried - the keys, being part of the Tardis, are connected to the telepathic circuitry.

During his year of imprisonment, the Doctor is able to psychically 'hack into' the Archangel network by virtue of it being linked to the Tardis's telepathic circuitry, and hence his own mind.  

When all the people in the world were saying ""Doctor"", it wasn't just the name that was important - they were remembering Martha's stories about him.  The flood of mental energy travelled back along the Archangel network, to where the Doctor was waiting to catch it.

In the Doctor Who universe 'Artron Energy' is the key to time travel, telepathy, and regeneration (see various Classic Who stories for more information, but particularly The Deadly Assassin).  The Doctor was able to use the massive amount of mental energy/ Arton energy to regain his youth, and temporarily boost his psychic abilities.",0,1320738469,null,0,false,0,c2y1nff,t3_m3uxz,t1_c2y1nff,t1_c2xv7n1,1427847359,9,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,9

For starters, I don't think most people even bother with the movie, and when they do they just dismiss the entire thing as utter crap, 8 included. Which, to be honest, it's really hard to judge the movie on a few simple facts. First of all it stands out as it's the only 90s American style Doctor Who to exist, and secondly because it was a glorified pilot episode. It really was not set up to be a standalone movie.

That aside, everyone judges the 8th Doctor on that, and never even bothers with the amazing audio adventures. Myself, and a few other 8 lovers, have been running around /r/Doctorwho trying to rectify this, but I haven't seen any visible trace that this has been helpful.

On top of that, just from my anecdotal observations here, 6/7 usually tends to be on top of the 'underappreciated' threads. It's usually started by someone posting a picture of 9. The first thread of comments tends to be,""Oh, here we go with this again."" Then the second thread of comments tends to be,""More like Colin Baker, amirite?"" Then, if you look far enough down in the post, you'll find me and my band of 8th Doctor ruffians talking about how nobody even considers him.

Davison, like every actor to play the Doctor, is actually a genius actor who understands the overall character of the Doctor and the ways in which his portrayal fits in with and is different to the rest. And he does *really* well when he's got good writing. Like all of JNT's Doctors, he never really had the writing he deserved on tv and is somewhere on the order of 10 times better in the audios, because Big Finish knows how to hire good writers and JNT really didn't. I guarantee you will be blown away by his acting in the audios, especially the ones I cited. This goes for all the Big Finish Doctors, including your favorite, Seven. For pure win, listen to the Excelis stories which all take place on the same planet in very different periods in its history. Each story features a different Doctor (5,6 and 7). It was made several years ago, and I'm not sure if it was purposely a vehicle to show how each actor had come into his own on audio, but that's exactly what it is.

A runs away and police do not catch up with A for a few days. How do we really know that A was drunk at the time and that B wasn't just saying that? So if they weren't in a cell soon after they had committed a crime its hard to say if they were drunk or on drugs or completely sober. Even then looking at the custody record wouldn't be a fantastic indication because if the person wasn't immediately arrested then that won't show on the custody record. As for looking through the crime database drunkenness is recorded but it won't be able to show you every crime where drink was involved unless you manually search every last record.

**EDIT:**
Less sarcastically, why on earth does he assume that if we stopped buying products of other countries, other countries would stop buying ours?  Generally, the price/value proposition in comparison to competing products is what determines which product consumers buy.

I think this guy is making a mistake that a lot of British people make -- he doesn't understand the way the world works.  He thinks that there's some kind of ethical 'give and take' at work in relations between countries.  We buy some of South Korea's products, and they'll buy ours in return, since we're all decent guys, eh?

What he fails to realise is that other nations do not have this 'Do unto others...' moral system.  They have their own moral systems, which are equally valid.

So in reality what occurs is, the British buy South Korean products because they are cheap, and want to feel like they don't discriminate against foreigners.  Meanwhile, the South Koreans buy only South Korean products, as they want to support South Korea and other South Koreans, and they encourage their friends and family to do the same.  They feel they are being smart by doing this, and they get respect from other countries for being rich and well-developed.

The South Korean government does the same, erecting barriers to foreign imports whenever South Korean industry requests it.  (The problems in getting foreign mobile phones sold in South Korea are a case in point -- This has given South Korea time to establish its own mobile phone industry.)

All this in spite of all the help that South Korea has received from the international community generally, and continues to receive from the US.

To clarify, the actual 'way the world works', is that each country just does what it feels is good for themselves, unless there's some kind of formal agreement in place, in which case it's like that cartoon you see posted to Reddit -- they'll try to piss all over each other without getting the contract wet.

I began to follow then in real life, watching highlights and reading about players almost constantly. My first game I watched was a dodgy foreign stream of the Spurs v Arsenal game. Y'know, the 3-2 one. I found a stream just as the second half had started and was instantly disappointed to see my beloved spurs down 2-0. But, my odd connection to the team kept me watching and I was rewarded with one of the best footballing displays I'd seen in my football watching career. Never looked back since. I'm regularly up at 3am watching the EPL games and loving the team as though it was my local. As a defender, I'd have to say my favorite player is Ledley King. That man can defend.

On shutting down social networks

Guardian

&gt;More than two-thirds of adults support the shutdown of social networks during periods of social unrest such as the riots in England this summer, new research has revealed.

Unisys

&gt;48 per cent of the public would support the temporary shutdown of social networks to prevent coordinated criminal activity during periods of civil unrest

On government access to social networking data

Guardian

&gt;Three-quarters agreed that governments should have open access to data on social network users in order to prevent co-ordinated crime

Unisys

&gt;A similar proportion (46%) accepts that the authorities should be able to access data from social networks if it helps improve public safety.

[The philosophical transactions of the Royal Society of London](http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=92lnIw3oKGMC&amp;pg=PA1&amp;dq=philosophical+transactions+of+the+royal+society&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=mkudTs_vLInZ8APToemvCQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=10&amp;ved=0CF0Q6AEwCQ#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false)

This is the first volume of a tonne of volumes covering all the things discussed by the Royal Society between 1665 and 1809.

They cover ever scientific discipline – often before 'science' was really recognised as a 'thing'. There’s also a healthy dose of mystery, monsters and nonsense.

There is so much brilliant stuff in these books. Emerging science, discoveries, proposals. It's incredible. And it’s all in a brilliantly deranged order - they’re discussing proper sciencey things one minute and mental stuff the next.

Just quickly from this (the first volume (1665 – 1672)):

* An Account of a monstrous Calf. 
* Making of Saltpetre in the Mogul’s Dominions
* Trials proposed by Mr Boyle for the Transfusion of Blood &amp;c. - ""As whether a fierce dog, by being often new stocked with the blood of a cowardly dog, may not become more tame, et vice versa?""
* An Account of two Monstrous Births, not long since produced in Devonshire
* Injecting of Liquors into the Blood
* Some Observations on Japan - ""The temper of their metals was formerly better than it is now; but yet they make cutlasses, or short swords, exceedingly good""
* New Star near the Beak of Cygnus
* Dissection of a Porpoise

If you have a bit of spare time, a trawl through a couple of volumes can produce some really wonderful results.

Otherwise, the relationship is as I describe above when I spoke about 'the way the world really works'.  (EDIT: I mean the relationship benefits South Koreans, and does not benefit Americans much.)  

Millions of South Koreans have immigrated to the US, and have been very successful in a wide variety of careers.  The SK government has recently decided it wants these people and their descendants -- anyone with South Korean ethnicity -- to 'promote South Korea' in their own country, whatever that means.

Meanwhile, Americans can only find work as English teachers in SK, where they are very likely to be cheated out of money by their employers.  Their employers will always be Korean, as foreigners are treated less favourably in the business environment.

Koreans do not employ foreign English teachers out of the goodness of their hearts -- The Korean English teachers simply do too bad of a job for it to be otherwise at the moment.

Korean companies produce web sites, documents, advertising copy etc. full of bad English, and desperately need native speakers to correct it.  But they won't employ non-Koreans for non-English-teaching jobs, even though millions are unemployed in the UK and US.

South Korea takes jobs away from Americans.  I'm not just talking about unskilled jobs -- GM has a lot of its cars designed in SK, for instance.

There doesn't seem to be much social cohesion in the US; people there just don't seem to give a damn about each other in everyday life.

It's not the Christianity of Christmas that's important to me -- I'm Atheist.  Rather it's a matter of what the UK's traditions are, and not bending over backwards to accommodate multiculturalism, which is something I don't think the British people ever wanted in the first place, and probably would have rejected if they were ever given the choice.

true,rasori,null,null,"Haha no worries, it may have caught me but I'm not sure if it caught anyone else. Generally speaking no, unless you're applying for specific scholarships (which, hey, it can't hurt trying). The Federal Loan process is pretty streamlined. Do your FAFSA sooner rather than later (I don't think it's possible to do before lat January though, and really it doesn't come up until June, so don't fret over it) as that will determine what you're eligible for in terms of Stafford loans. The remainder (ie, the cost of attendance beyond what's covered in Stafford Loans and which you aren't expected to be able to pay because of current finances... that's a confusing way to say it but it is what it is) should be available in the form of PLUS loans.

I'm doing Software Development at the moment, if you do come along we may well bump into each other.

I think the halls are a pretty good idea in the first year. As you have relatives in the UK you could probably side-step the guarantor problems I had (assuming you're at least on decent terms with them), but it still makes it difficult to find a flat. Most student-rented flats are actually signed for around January-March, which adds another layer of difficulty for you. The main downfall of halls is also the main benefit, which is to say: the people. Some of them will be awesome, others will be drunks who stumble in at 4AM and wake you up by pulling the fire alarm, or whatever else. This will be true at UoL halls as well as at UNITE's options. I haven't looked at prices but a bonus for UNITE is the locations, many are directly on campus and/or in City Centre, which will save you a little under 300 GBP on the Student's yearly bus pass, a must if you're in UoL halls as they're about an hour away at a relaxed pace (on foot of course).

I don't mind. GPA I was actually around a 3.4 which was no problem especially because I did quite well on SATs, SAT IIs, and my one AP exam. I probably didn't need to have all of those. I'd recommend only one of the SAT or ACT, they won't see both as any major bonus, but the subject tests (SAT IIs, I believe ACT has an equivalent) are a decent idea.

Their acceptance can be Unconditional (you've already shown everything they need to see to accept you) or Conditional (you need to achieve a certain score on X test, generally a test you told them you were waiting for results on). Both are very good, as a Conditional is just that: accepted on the condition that you get that score. Once you get your results you just pass them along and you're in. They can't take it away from you for the fact that they over-filled or something. Some Universities (probably just really popular ones like Cambridge and Oxford)  shy away from Conditionals, however, and just decline you if you don't already have your scores (this happened to my girlfriend). So if at all possible, try to take your standardized tests early to help your chances.",0,1320767198,null,0,false,0,c2y3sg5,t3_lumlg,t1_c2y3sg5,t1_c2xb1ug,1427848359,1,false,Liverpool,t5_2r21z,1

true,loudribs,eng-yorkshire,2 'E's and some 'LSD',"Legally, the chances are that you are in a bind. Assuming you're on an Assured Shorthold Tenancy (which tends to be the bulk of people in private rented), there are grounds to issue a Section 8 Notice to Quit if the mortgage (which can pre-date the tenancy) has gone into arrears and the property stands to be repossessed.

Now, a Section 8 simply says that you should quit the tenancy within two weeks, or go to court. However, the Notice has to expire before they can actually file to get you to court and that will usually take an additional 2 months-ish. After that, you could continue to stay put until the bailiffs turn up and actually turf you out. All in all, that process would take about three months.

The problem you have is that the law is on the side of the mortgagee here and I don't really see how you could fight it in court. I think you're best bet is trying to reason with the mortgagee. They probably won't let you stay for the full course of the tenancy but they may give you a grace period in which to find a new tenancy.

Sorry to be the bearer of bad news. I would contact CAB in case they've spotted something I've missed and do check to see what type of contract you are on, but otherwise I think that you're not onto a winner here.

*EDIT* - I would still definitely check this out with Shelter or CAB. I've worked in housing for years but I'm not a lawyer and I've never dealt with a repossession eviction. What's above is from me looking at the legislation and my gut feeling is that it would be very hard to fight in court but there may be some sneaky plays I don't know about.",0,1320767313,null,0,true,0,c2y3szb,t3_m4u93,t1_c2y3szb,t3_m4u93,1427848366,4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,4

I'm 100% English but grew up in America.  I sound American.  And so I *am* American in the eyes of everyone I meet.  I can show everyone my passport or birth certificate; wouldn't matter.  Sounds funny; not English.

true,how_awful_for_her,null,null,"&gt; It isn't possible for one nation to be the best at everything.

But it's not all about being 'the best', although that's always good.  It's about usefully employing your population.  Why have your people sitting around idle, starving or wasting money on welfare, or resorting to crime, when you can have them usefully employed in an industry, helping to support the other industries in your country?

Now I'm not saying that that's everything, but it goes a long way.

Imagine you have a web design company with 100 employees.  Business is very slow; most of your employees are sitting around doing nothing all day, but you don't want to lay any of them off.  An order comes in for a website for a bookshop, which must have an online store.  As you've never made a website with an online store before, you refer the customer to another web design company who is known to be really good at online stores.  The other company is sure to be better.

Sensible?  No.  If you've got spare capacity, you should use it.

&gt; However you cannot be better than everyone at everything.

But barring environmental factors, I don't why a country should restrict itself in what it can and can't do.  Japan and South Korea couldn't make decent electronics in times past, but now they can.

He hasnt even been in the prem for a year and he is still very young for a defender. Had Luiz fallen over like alex did in the blackburn game when yakubu almost scored he would have been crucified. 

Yes Luiz is very good on the ball,but having him at CB means he gives the team am x-factor. Teams are unsure how to mark a CB who can beat tgem one on one and can score goalrs.  Not to mention we have yet to see Luiz play with a solid RB next to him. In tge Man City game last season Luiz put in a flawless performance. He single handedly shut down the man city offense and quaterbacked chelseas play from the back.

I think the problem with the team right now is that there are a lot of new faces tryimg to prove their worth and gain confidence. I think once tge team settles in and we gain more chemistry we will start devastating teams.

Because if you read the [investigation linked in the article](http://www.thedisinformed.co.uk/2010/12/12/the-winterval-myth/) (pdf, a long one) as to how this whole ball of stinking lies got rolling you will see that one of the original aims was to encourage German stall holders to come over and have a Christmas Fair, it was part of the commercial packaging for that. Like the poster unamerican linked to said ""Christmas in Birmingham, come for the shopping, stay for the day. Winterval 98"". And what could be more British than pushing Christmas as a commercial opportunity? If it was being subordinated to anything it was the pursuit of money. 

But before you get too precious about British festivals, remember that the Germans and Coca Cola invented most of what we now see as the traditional British Christmas (Charles Dickens invented much of the rest as far back as 1843, so pretty ancient).

Edit: 

Lets have some facts.

&gt;Why weren't they included the first year? Presumably the council was on the back foot after receiving a lot of criticism, and wanted to seem like they weren't just pandering to multiculturalism.

Actually the council was not on the back foot when Winterval 98 was planned. It had run without any complaint the year before with this remit:

&gt;41 days and nights of activity that ranged from BBC Children in Need, to
the Christmas Lights Switch On, to a Frankfurt Christmas Market, outdoor
ice rink, Aston Hall by Candlelight, Diwali, shopping at Christmas, world
class theatre and arts plus, of course, New Year's Eve with its massive
100,000 audience.

It was successful and was expanded to include both earlier and later events in year 2.

It was only on 8th November ~~2008~~1998 (edit), well into Winterval 98 that a local paper ran an attack piece on it, following a speech by a bishop the week before. So no, your attempts to hang on to some sense that Winterval was part of some sort of attack on British values does not hold up to the facts. But that is not your fault, the press have done such a job on Winterval that it is extremely hard to dislodge the idea that there must have been something behind their lies.",0,1320775479,null,0,true,0,c2y5312,t3_m4mi6,t1_c2y5312,t1_c2y2rvn,1427849003,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

what you will find is that the reason that there is a much higher turn over in traders than bankers and more younger traders than older in banks is because after a decade of trading in a bank the average trader quickly realises how things work and that they dont need the bank so they go it alone. either that or they move upstairs into management.

The Notice to Quit takes two weeks to run and it's merely a legal document that says 'We would very much like you to leave or else...'. Once that runs for its two weeks notice period it is then taking to court and it is for the court to decide whether you actually go (which will probably take about two months) After that, it's bailiff time so you're looking at a total of 3 months.

The reason why I am pessimistic is that Section 8 contains a clear provision for the eviction of tenants in the case of the house being repossessed and I'm not entirely sure that there's a legal defence against that clause. Granted, you may have had more luck but that's because your landlady sold up, something which is not covered by Section 8. A repossession is a different proposition all together.

true,how_awful_for_her,null,null,"&gt; Why? To what end? To make you more comfortable?

That would be one reason, yes.  Not just me though -- most British people.  It is a democracy.

&gt; If you don't want to celebrate diwali, don't.

But if I'm paying for it, and there are diwali lights and diwali events going on all around me, and all my neighbours are out celebrating diwali on the streets and in their homes, and everyone I pass is shouting something about diwali to me, and people keep asking me what I'm doing for diwali, I'm going to feel (and be?) pretty isolated when I don't celebrate diwali.

And remember, we're talking about official diwali events, organised by the council here.  No-one's going to complain if people are having private diwali parties.

The other thing is, it sends a signal that it's OK for those people not to integrate into British society.  Is the city going to have to have official celebrations from every country of the world?  And is every school in the city going to have to have diwali events?  Perhaps they'll be wanting their own faith schools too, and for lessons to be taught in Hindi.  Later they'd be wanting Hindi to be recognised as an official language of the UK.  Look at the big picture here.

It might even attract immigrant families who don't want to integrate from other cities or countries.  Remember, the British people were never asked if they wanted millions to immigrate, and to become a multicultural society.  I suppose America had to welcome immigrants and be a multicultural society because of history or geography, but the UK is a small country who never really needed mass immigration, and never really wanted to be 'multicultural'.

Nonetheless, it was forced upon us anyway, and it's still going on.  I'd like to do everything in my power to make my country as unattractive as possible to immigrants, without being a total prick about it.  I don't think that asking the council not to endorse these kinds of multicultural events too strongly is unreasonable.

As for your situation, it's just human nature.  If you sound American, then people are going to think, 'There's that American guy'.  Is that so bad?  I knew an American guy in the UK and he got all the girls because of his accent.  He was quite average-looking.

If I went over to the US, and didn't lose the accent, I'd be 'that British guy'.  If I immigrated to South Korea somehow, I'd be 'foreigner' or 'British' until the day I died, even if I did lose the accent.

People don't realise that your sister-in-law and son are not recent immigrants, or from immigrant families with ties to their homelands.  There are significant numbers of immigrants in the UK who are first- and second-generation immigrants, and have family 'back home', so it's not like it's a totally ridiculous thing for them to expect.

I doubt people ever would congratulate your family on 'assimilating'; that might sound pretty patronising, especially if they know your backgrounds.

&gt; As for other countries, Spain tried to ban the Basque culture and England did its best to stamp out the Celtic cultures. And that's gone just swimmingly for everyone involved, hasn't it.

Well, South Korea has barely had any Muslim immigrants from the middle-east until recently, and even now it's still very small numbers.  They haven't had the problems some other countries have had with Muslim immigrants either -- terrorism, crime, riots, whatever.  So I'd say that that's been a pretty successful policy.",0,1320776920,null,0,false,0,c2y5btt,t3_m4mi6,t1_c2y5btt,t1_c2y4pu6,1428183267,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

I don't mind Christmas being somewhat commercial -- we have to be realistic about these things, and I'd prefer that to having it be too religious.

&gt; But before you get too precious about British festivals, remember that the Germans and Coca Cola invented most of what we now see as the traditional British Christmas (Charles Dickens invented much of the rest as far back as 1843, so pretty ancient).

Well, that isn't particularly relevant.  Our language is made up from bits of other languages too, but that doesn't mean I don't want immigrants to speak English.

&gt; It was only on 8th November 2008, well into Winterval 98 

You mean, 1998.

&gt; But that is not your fault, the press have done such a job on Winterval that it is extremely hard to dislodge the idea that there must have been something behind their lies.

I didn't see about this in the press at the time.  It's more like, I was responding to the hyperbole in this thread and the linked articles.

However, I can see the benefits of what you're talking about -- Christmas isn't 'stretched out' too far, non-Christmas-related winter events can also be included -- I think you have a point, and perhaps I've gone too far with my condemnation of this idea.  Really I'm not sure about the reason for including all these events under one banner, but I could imagine that there are good reasons for an event planner to do this.  I can also imagine the event planners taking pride in being as thorough as possible, and wanting to have as many events as possible for people to enjoy.

""Now, entity, what can I show you? Let's start with evil from the dawn of time and start from there, shall we?""

""You can't fool me, Doctor. These things that you're showing me, they're not real, they can't be.""

""I wouldn't make these things up, I couldn't. I saw them all.""

""Impossible. How did you survive?""

""By facing them. You can't deny fear, you can't give in to it. You have to face it. That's what makes you stronger. That's what made me win in the end.""

""Enough, Doctor, stop this!""

""I thought you liked fear. I thought it tasted good. What's the matter? Have you fed on too much honeydew? Is the milk of paradise turning sour? Oh, well if these fears aren't to your liking, let's try some others, shall we? How about this one?""

""No, no...stop, I'll give you anything you want, Doctor. Anything, if you stop!""

""Karen was right. You can't cope. Not when it's real. Evil from the past is one thing, but I have seen the future, too.""

""Doctor, please...such pain...such loss...so many fears. I've seen enough.""

""Wouldn't you like to see what's coming? It scares the living daylights out of me, I wonder what it'll do to you.""

""Don't show me anymore, Doctor, please!""

""Wait, wait, wait, wait, there's worse than that! There are the things that I am afraid that I might do one day...""

I don't know that they play a *bigger* role, but the subject tests are much easier to compare with their A-Levels over here, which is mostly what they look for.

I have a tough time saying what it's like overall here, mostly because I've been here for over 2 years, and prior to that I was a shut-in for a year, and prior to that I was in Germany for the better part of a year... you get what I'm saying. But I'd definitely say on the whole it's a lot more mellow here at least in regards to politics. Aside from student fees, you can very well go two years without learning what a person's political views are at all (I know, and I have done it). Religion's also quite toned down here, naturally some are more religious than others but the general populace seems to be pretty neutral on the matter. I also don't watch TV at all (you have to pay for a ""TV License"" to watch stuff as it's being broadcast, and while I have access to things like BBC iPlayer which would allow me to watch at my leisure without paying, I don't really) so I can't say much on that front. Even news is kind of ""meh"" for me, I get most of it through reddit.

I use buses for everything. Sundays and late nights can suck sometimes, but from UoL's halls (and most student flats) the same bus will get you to Uni and to city center, and it's quite rare you have to take more than one to get where you're going. The ""Student Saver"" yearly passes are valid anywhere in Liverpool and on many buses beyond, and therefore make a pretty viable option. The morning rush (9AM classes) is horrific, however.

Cost of living depends entirely on how you live ;) In respect to groceries, my girlfriend and I buy all the store-brand stuff in as much bulk as we can, and as a result we don't find that we spend all that much. I also get 10% off on my food shopping at ASDA because I work at Wal-Mart when I'm home, so that could be a help in that regard.

A lot of Hartnell's early stories (the First Doctor) had a continuing narrative, but watching them out of order would not harm your enjoyment.  

There was the Key to Time season in Tom Baker's era, in which that entire season had adventures all tied into the Doctor's search for the parts of the Key to Time, in order to stop the Black Guardian.

There's also the Trial of a Time Lord season at the end of Colin Baker's time as the Doctor.  Several stories all tied into the titular trial, leading up to the conclusion.

The latter part of Sylvester McCoy's time as the Doctor involved what was leading into what fans refer to as the Cartmel Masterplan (basically, the script editor's story arc involving the companion, Ace)

true,Boootylicious,english,Northamptonshire,"But is it political? And to what extent?

The poppy is about as political as the england shirt itself. To allow one but not the other is contradictory.

I'd argue that it's not at all political. Just symbolic. A symbol of respect and pride to ones country. The same as a national football strip.

If anything, the poppy (and the poppy appeal) is charitable. (well, it is in no way commercial, has no political stance or leaning, and is in no way religious) And charitable symbols have been worn during games in the past.

I understand that FIFA have to have these sort of rules in place to stop the extremes (whatever they may be). But when it is very very loosely prohibited by their rulings and is, essentially, offending a whole nation. You'd think they'd ease off a bit to commemorate fallen heroes. 

*** in writing that, i see your view of it being political. They're *our* fallen heroes. Not Spain's. Spain may take offence? I doubt it. But its an interesting perspective.

At the end of it all, I would welcome my tax money being spent on a potential fine if the team went ahead with it anyway. I think it would put england back on the map!! Grrr!

true,SendInTheNinjas,null,null,"This happened to my fiance and I just before last Xmas. The landlord had repeatedly defaulted on his mortgage and the first we knew about it was an eviction notice plopping on our doormat. Firstly, we got in contact with the solicitors who were acting for the mortgage lenders and asked what the fuck was going on. They said we had to send them a copy of our tenancy agreement and, if they found it to be 'valid', they would let us stay and the bank would be our landlord. Whilst this was going on, we also went to the county court to apply for a hearing to have a judge decide wether they could evict us. I studied the relevant legislation, which I think is the 'mortgage repossession act 2010', and it said we had to be given proper notice, which had not happened. I dressed up smart and went to the court, nobody else turned up, and the judge took one look at my notes and said she would protect us and said the bank would have to apply for the eviction process all over again. I got back to find the bank had decided to keep us as tenants anyway. 

Sorry for the wall of text but my point is there are ways you can stop this, but you need to act quickly and fight tooth-and-nail. Contact the mortgage lender to see what can be done. Ignore the letting agent - we phoned ours when this happened and they couldn't give a shit - and get down to the county court, seriously they get tonnes of these things that need hearings and it's very easy to set one up.",0,1320794018,null,0,false,0,c2y896d,t3_m4u93,t1_c2y896d,t3_m4u93,1427850464,5,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,5

true,Inequilibrium,null,null,"While it is far better to watch Moffat's previous episodes before series 5, it's not that hard to understand.

River: It's not like we knew who River was anyway. The library two-parter is a proper introduction, but it's also kind of just foreshadowing/spoilers if you watch it now. It's reasonable to come into that storyline from the same perspective Amy does.

Weeping Angels: Again, the use of a companion as an audience avatar makes this inconsequential, since Amy has to find out what the Angels are too. And the Daleks, and Cybermen, and everything else she encounters. Doctor Who has brought back old villains a hundred times and it's not strictly necessary to have seen all the past episodes with them. (The angels in series 5 aren't even that connected to the ones in series 3.)

The TARDIS crash: Honestly... does this matter at all? Again, it's assuming we need to know every little thing in a show where we *don't* know every little thing.

Starting from David Tennant would be ridiculous, and I've never seen anyone recommend that, because it's basically in the middle of RTD's arc and series 2 picks up with most of the same characters. But Smith was supposed to be a good starting point, presumably now that the series has started getting longer and hence more difficult for new viewers to get into. It's a lot less daunting to start with a commitment to a smaller number of episodes before going back.

Plus, series 1 starts off with a mediocre and slow stretch that makes it even more difficult to get people into than the length already would.",0,1320803189,null,0,false,0,c2y9n46,t3_m5b18,t1_c2y9n46,t1_c2y95ds,1427851332,7,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,7

I myself opted in years ago but it took me some time to get around to doing it as there was no online registration at the time - you had to go and get paperwork from a GP and I hadn't had a reason to go to my GP in ages. Had I been killed in the meantime then my organs would have been wasted.

As it see the simplest solution would just be to require everyone to make the decision one way or another when they; enter the NHS system, reach 18, register with a new GP, or within a certain time after making their next GP appointment. 

By which I mean you get the paperwork and have to explicitly state yes or no and its kept on file as part of your NHS records, everyone's decision is crystal-clear to the NHS and their family, and we have no opt-in-by-default or opt-out-by-default. If you are carrying a card or your records state that you opted Yes then its a Yes, if your records state No then its a No. That way the only people who would be a ""maybe"" would be those whom the process hadn't yet caught up with (which should be a fairly short-term thing) in which case they'd be a No.",0,1320841680,null,0,true,0,c2ydiya,t3_m5xpo,t1_c2ydiya,t1_c2yd9je,1427853147,4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,4

It deals with the real problem, that there aren't enough donors (even if 80% of families opt out there will be more donors than are needed) and also allows a stronger opt in.

however you need to have at least

You can buy today in anticipation of general price increases or you can wait until tomorrow hoping for companies to have fire sales before going out of business, but if you start buying stuff you don't need you are just wasting money.

Generally speaking I'd recommend:

* Keep three months salary in the bank for emergencies (in an account with no access restrictions).

This looks like a good tour of Scotland but you could do the following things if you rented a car:

* Take a slightly longer route to Inverness through Speyside and visit at least one Whisky distillery. You are coming to Scotland, after all. [Web page with some information on the distilleries in Speyside](http://www.scotchwhisky.net/distilleries/dist_trail.htm)
* On your way from Fort William back to Edinburgh, stop at the [Loch Leven Seafood Cafe](http://www.lochlevenseafoodcafe.co.uk/) for some excellent seafood fresh from Loch Leven.
* Stop at the Glencoe National Park and admire the mountains.

There is no justification for the bullying or intimidation of **Christ-believers** and that has been rectified in law, but we've moved on to a new game. We're now seeing these attitudes of intolerance they accuse their opponents of.""

Oddly enough we could see the above written by someone who was speaking out against the moves by religious leaders to get their intolerance and bigotry enshrined in law! I've seen this so many times in the last few years - Certain types of religious people take a stance or line of argument that is actually used correctly *against* them. (i.e. Creationists argue that evolution is anti-scientific, when in reality the Creationist position is the one going against the scientific method)

I often wonder whether the people who claim these things *really* believe what they're saying or if they're simply trying to convince people who don't understand or know enough about the issue:

&gt; There is an increased perception among some Christian groups that it is harder for the devout to live out their faith because of legislation such as the Equality Act. Christian guesthouse owners Peter and Hazelmary Bull are in court this week trying to overturn a ruling that they broke the law by refusing to allow a gay couple to stay in a double room, while a group of politicians and peers are holding ""select committee style"" hearings to establish whether or not British laws discriminate against Christians.

Here's a simple test to see if you think someone might be being persecuted for ""what they believe"" or for trying to ""live by their conscience"" which is how some Christians attempt to excuse not wanting to discriminate against homosexuals:

Replace the word ""gay"" with ""black"" or ""Jew"" or even ""woman"".

&gt; We are Christians and as such we do not believe that two gay people should share a double bed in our private hotel. The bible speaks clearly about the immorality of gay people.

becomes

&gt; We are Christians and as such we do not believe that two black people should share a double bed in our private hotel. The bible speaks clearly about the immorality of black people.

(Note: private hotel isn't a decent argument as the service is supposed to be for the public)

There are passages in the bible that people use to justify racism: Just have a look at any religious group historically defending the slave trade. Heck, there are even passages that *could* be used to argue against mixed race marriage! How likely would it be that any hotel owner would even think of using that as a reason to turn away a black woman and a white man?! None, because they know they wouldn't have a leg to stand on, even if anyone still thinks that way.

Incidentally if anyone thought, like I did until yesterday, that the Bulls treated the ""unmarried"" but civil partnered gay couple the same as heterosexual unmarried couples, this is not the case. Apparently an unmarried couple, one of whom is a NSS member, were allowed to share a double bed and weren't even asked if they were married.

When I visited with my family a few years ago, the language barrier wasn't a problem, but I had trouble with where to eat, how to act. 

We ate one night at the top of a pub that served food. We were the only ones there and they seemed sort of surprised that someone wanted to eat there. I got the feeling we'd committed some sort of faux-pas like just walking into a Starbucks and ordering a spread of a dozen pastries for lunch. Later, walking around town we couldn't  decide where to eat because we didn't know what kind of place everything was, whether it was a locals-only sort of joint, the equivalent of eating at a gas-station, or a regular restaurant. When we finally made it to a pub to actually have a drink (hands-down my favorite place I went in England) we sat and waited to be served for half an hour before one of us realized you had to order.

I'm not wild about #2 - things left unsaid are easy to retcon/ignore/forget.

The bigger question is whether the whole question of his past is a subject that should really be explored or left unsaid?

We have a hard enough time understanding what it would have been like to live through the Blitz. Imagine how hard it would be to understand the internet when you grew up in a time when you didn't even have a calculator. 

Sure there are over 65s who use and understand internet perfectly. Problem is the majority don't. They don't understand the culture on the internet and the methods of interaction. If they encounter something they dislike or disapprove of, they become offended. They write letters and complain to someone. They start campaigns on matters they are offended by, but don't understand fully. They use emotive language and build up support.

And they are easily convinced that social networking is frequently used for criminal purposes, and that the government should have powers to turn it off during times of unrest. These are dangerous attitudes to have at a time when the world is shifting so dramatically, culturally and socially. We are giving people a say on a world which they will not be a direct part of.

No. No no no no no. Families would still be consulted and there was no intention to change that. What I think is the case at the moment is that families are consulted even if someone says ""Take my organs"". The change would be so that Dr's can ask as matter of course?

Don't believe the first paragraph there. Look at the info panel:

&gt; Under the Welsh government's proposals people will be considered to have made an ""expressed view"" that they want their organs to be donated, unless they opt out.    
There will not be a family veto against allowing organs to be used.    
However, the health minister told BBC Wales she did not think that the proposals would mean families losing the ability to refuse the organs of loved ones being donated for transplant after they die.    
She said, in practice, she ""**could not see a situation where clinicians take the organs of a donor without the permission of families**"".

That directly contradicts itself, surely? Direct quote from the minister implying the complete opposite. I'm surprised to see this in the BBC.

&gt; At present, people have to opt to join the NHS organ donor register if they want to donate their organs and tissues after their death.    
An opt-out system for Wales would mean unless an individual makes an objection, their organs and tissues would be available for donation after their death, but their relatives would be involved in the decision making process around donation.

So don't believe the spin, please.

Edit - Addition:

Make things even easier: [Check out the white paper](http://wales.gov.uk/docs/dhss/consultation/111107orgdonwpen.pdf). Page 13 has most of the relevant information.

At the moment: 

&gt; 66. Currently where organ donation is being considered, a clinician will firstly 
check the ODR to ascertain whether an individual has indicated they would wish 
to be an organ donor. Regardless of whether an individual is on the register or not, 
clinicians will approach family members to ascertain the wishes and views of the 
deceased person about donation. This allows any evidence from the family of the 
individual’s recent wishes to be understood.

Also, it's still the case that relatives do not have the right to *stop* the deceased's organs being taken if they said ""Yes"" to organ donation.

&gt;  69. The Codes of Practice currently advise health professionals to sensitively 
encourage relatives to accept the deceased’s wishes, whilst making it clear that the 
relatives do not have the right to override those wishes. 

Also:

&gt; 70. The Welsh Government is committed to a soft opt-out system of organ and 
tissue donation in which the views of relatives will be taken into account. Retaining 
the role of relatives in this way serves a number of purposes –     
a) it acts as an important safeguard: families may be aware of an 
unregistered objection;

All the scheme is doing is ensuring that more people are saved by organ donation. Whilst the objection ""It's my body and they have no right to take things without my consent"" is understandable, this is easily over ridden by telling a family member or expressing your view on the donation register.    

Whilst I can understand that people do not think they should *have* to opt out but people should have to opt in, I would have to say: ""Shame"". This is an altruistic move with numerous options given to carry out your wishes if you don't want to donate.

I'd like to also point out that there are numerous state endorsed ""opt out"" schemes currently running that no-one seems to care about: When you have a crash an ambulance will likely come and take you to hospital. How dare they - you're not theirs to do with as you please, particularly unconscious. What gives them the right to try and save your life?

An extreme example, but it's an altruistically motivated policy which is exactly what this the opt-out organ donation scheme is all about.",0,1320857078,null,0,true,0,c2yfbta,t3_m5xpo,t1_c2yfbta,t3_m5xpo,1427854032,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

true,[deleted],null,null,"All I'm saying is that nothing in the most recent television continuity really does anything against the previous canon.

Also:  

""Cartmel felt that years of explanations about the Doctor's origins and the Time Lords had removed much of the mystery and strength of the character of the Doctor, and decided to make the Doctor ""once again more than a mere chump of a Time Lord"".[1] Elements of this effort were liberally scattered through Seasons 25 and 26 of the series, and occasionally included hints about the Doctor's past; for example, in Silver Nemesis, when Ace and the Doctor discuss the creation of validium, the Doctor mentions that it was created by Omega and Rassilon. Ace asks, ""And...?"" and the Doctor is silent. Cartmel has written that this was meant to indicate that the Doctor was ""more than a Time Lord""""

""...Omega and Rassilon were the founding fathers of Gallifrey. They towered above the Time Lords who followed. They were demigods. And Ace's nifty dialogue ""And..."" coupled with the Doctor's neatly evasive response, are a subtle attempt to say that there was a third presence there in the shadowy days of Gallifrey's creation. In other words, the Doctor was also there. So he's more than a Time Lord. He's one of these half-glimpsed demigods.""

""Omega apparently died creating the black hole which provided the raw power needed for time travel, turning the Gallifreyans into Lords of Time. (Some accounts suggest that Rassilon misled Omega into believing he would survive this mission.) Rassilon and the Other were left to pick up the pieces, with Rassilon harnessing the nucleus of the black hole to create the Eye of Harmony and becoming virtual dictator of Time Lord civilisation. As Rassilon's rule became more oppressive, the Other knew that his own days were numbered.

The Other first ensured that his granddaughter Susan (the last child to be naturally born on Gallifrey) was safe, sending her to the spaceport to get off the planet. Then, in a last gesture of defiance against Rassilon's rule, he committed suicide by throwing himself into the Looms, mixing his genetic material into the banks.""

*By the way... there's Susan again... interestingly...*

""Eons passed, and the Looms became integrated into the great Houses of Gallifrey. Eventually, a new Cousin was born to the House of Lungbarrow, who would become known as the Doctor. Disenchanted with Time Lord society, the Doctor stole a TARDIS, intending to explore the universe. However, inside he discovered that the Hand of Omega, the stellar manipulator Omega had used to create the Eye of Harmony, had followed him on board, somehow recognising inside him one of its creators. Although time travel into Gallifrey's past was strictly forbidden, the Hand overrode the locks that prevented the TARDIS from doing so and took the Doctor back to the Old Time.""

*And here's the rub:*

For the Hand of Omega to recognize the Doctor as one of it's creators, the Doctor has to have been one of it's creators, or such a close facsimile that the Hand doesn't know the difference.  The single possibility here, when the rest of the canon is taken into account, is that the Doctor is made of stuff of The Other, having thrown himself into the looms.

Now, understand that much of the above is from a novelization, but also don't forget that the same stuff that's part of ""Rememberance of the Daleks"" is also shot through the television canon (the main canon) by way of confirmation of the legend of the Hand of Omega, the existence of the Looms, and the shadowy figure from the beginning of Galifrey.  

Here's where it get's interesting, at least for me:  This part of the Canon isn't exactly negatable; even in the classic sense of some television character saying ""oh, none of that's true"".

If we accept that the second that the Dr was brought back, his memories help repopulate the universe, do we, by proxy, assume that the people that he brought back also brought back the people that they remember, etc, etc?

If we do, then Jenny continues to exist, but if we don't, then we have to remove Jenny, as his lack of knowledge of her survival would render her non-existant.

But heres the only unofficial explanation I've heard, and it seems pretty plausible to me:  The last episode with a regeneration(Planet of Spiders) had not only the Doctor regenerating, but another Time Lord as well.  That Time Lord, K’anpo Rimpoche, had mental projection of himself acting as his assistant.  When he needed to regenerate the projection vanished and replaced his physical body.  The next episode with a regeneration is Logopolis, so some have concluded the Watcher is likewise a mental projection of the Doctor, albeit on he was not initially aware he was generating. 

Couldn't find it on youtube, but at the 5:05 mark here you see Rimpoche's regeneration:

His tackling and interceptions are incredible and he is the reason we were able to hold off AC Milan last year. 

Parker is incredible at what he does: harassing the opposing midfield to force errors, making tackles, and retaining possession in the back four. 
However, he is more of a box to box player than a DM. 
My main issue with Parker is that he moves around the pitch too much. With Parker and Modric both moving around, there is no lynchpin to offense. This is very dangerous against the creative attacking teams. 

Our main issue right now is retaining possession, and to do so we need a CM who will sit at the top of the offense and distribute. Parker and Modric both float around the pitch too much. We need a ""Makelele"" for the team to work around and utilize when in possession. Not all of our front six can flow around the pitch freely, someone needs to sit in front of the defense.

I live in Japan and we have a lot of train suicides. They're awful and fucking traumatizing to people who have to witness them. They're also messy and there poor station people have to jump down and put the body in a bag and carry it off and do a quick clean so train services can resume.

His intent is the same as if he'd used the rude word. Meanwhile as an adult you say ""Oh tits"" or ""Oh shit"". Your intent is exactly the same as if you'd said ""Oh dash it"" or ""FUCK!"" Yet some words really upset people. Silly really.

Some words have connotations. Nigger for example. Or cunt in the US in particular.

A mate of mine is a crime scene photographer in Paris and during his training he was called to photograph one of the jumpers remains. He said it was the worst job he ever had to do taking photos of the bits and pieces in the metro tunnel.

A colleague of mine witnessed a guy jump off a pedestrian bridge into the path of an RER train. He saw the body explode into pieces on impact. He fainted and woke up with the pompiers (firemen) kneeling over him.

One of the saddest things I saw was posters stuck up in the metro asking people if they knew the person pictured. The pic was from the morgue. He was an African with no ID papers on him. His body had been hit at Metro station St Paul and then somehow carried through the tunnel and deposited on the platform of the next Metro station Bastille, about 500 meters away. I never found out if he had been identified or not.

Yes and I agree it is horribly selfish to kill yourself this way. But for some people it is their only option.

If I've misunderstood cylinderhead's comment, then I'm happy to take it back. But it did sound very much like attributing the blame for this tragedy to everyone's favourite political bogeymen.

And as for the Tories being my favourite political party... well, now you're the one who could do with exercising some critical thinking.

The financial advisors I'm familiar with all get paid on commission, which effectively turns them into mortgage salesmen.

The ""independent"" just turns out to be bullshit, because they can just write whatever ""advice"" they need to, to sell you the package that gives them the most commission.

The stuff they're recommending are all commercial offerings by financial institutions, which all have sales teams allocated to them - the focus is on making a profit. I believe the financial institutions even have computer software that they give to these financial advisors to make it easier for them to generate bullshit reports. 

I do work for a small family firm of financial advisors, and 7 years ago they were telling me ""you need to get on the property ladder, mate"". This was at the time you could buy new-build houses ""off the plan"" and you could make big profits on houses before construction had even finished!     
It must be about 5 years ago now that the youngest members of the family firm (the daughter and the son-in-law, both of whom worked in the office, him as advisor, her doing office admin) bought a house together - their first, I think - on an interest-only mortgage. Last time I heard they were £20,000+ underwater on it. I wouldn't be surprised if that figure was £40k, considering how much they planned to spend on their wedding. That mortgage must be up for renewal any time right about now.     
The bottom-line is that these guys bet and lost on the market going up, because they were sure that property prices were going to keep going up indefinitely.
