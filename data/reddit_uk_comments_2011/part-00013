Moreover, because of the nature of the cracks, and Amy having grown up in close proximity to one, she was able to remember and bring back the Doctor.  
  
   Now, how did the cracks affect anything if their cause never happened?  I think it's because they're more than just cracks in physical space or cracks even in time.  They were tears in the fabric of reality itself, much deeper stuff.  Which is why they took their time in closing rather than simply blinking out.

Having a past address will also help a great deal.

This may or may not be a life choice of hers but I always feel these people have a point. I feel that *some* homeless are the only ones closest to being 'free'. No taxes, no insurance, no mortgage, nothing to lose and everything to gain. A lifestyle built on survival and not being a slave to the corruption of our own existence. I am obviously taking the *crazies* into account here, not the homeless that are on drugs or drink and have given up on the world.

true,crunchbag,cnty-scotland,Scotland,"Because Bahrain hasn't got to the point of an actual pitched conflict with tanks, warplanes etc. wouldn't it be a lot more difficult to intervene? A no-fly zone wouldn't stop the violence and and the military are mostly within the cities so they only real intervention may have to be by ground forces which could get a hell of a lot messier. In Libya, at least in theory, shooting down warplanes and bombing tank columns would be a bit cleaner.

There is also the politics of the region to consider. The Arab League calling for an intervention is, I feel, very significant. Without that kind of support, an intervention in Bahrain, especially with all of the civilian casualties a land operation would entail, could further worsen relations between East &amp; West, potentially causing more deaths further down the line.

I'm not saying the oil isn't a factor, it may be. Personally I think it is more likely that, for Cameron at least, it is a political move. He's hoping to move attention away from domestic affairs (remember, the big TUC demo in London is next week) and deliver the P.R. win of a relatively clean conflict to protect civilians where the rebels at least will probably welcome any support they get.

TL;DR Libya provides a high profile opportunity for a military intervention against a force that is being seen to bomb civilians. It might (hopefully) be relatively clean and wouldn't do too much damage to international relations.

true,nabbit,irish,London,"If you were around West London, it was probably Anne Smith. She was at one time a well regarded concert violinist, until she broke up with her lover and ran into money problems - she drove her car away from her problems until it ran out of petrol, then lived in it for the next 30 years.

The car was towed away by the council a few years ago after residents started to complain that the car (a Ford Consul) was a health hazard as rats had been seen coming out of the car. Despite campaigning by a number of residents to keep the car there, it was removed by Hounslow Council. I believe she now sleeps at Charing Cross Hospital - she refuses any offer of accomodation by the council, but she generally spends her days wandering around West London, cursing and swearing at anyone who crosses her.

It's a very interesting story - I wasn't aware of the Alan Bennett book until now, I'll have to have a read of that as it seems very similar to Miss Smith's story.

You can read more about Anne Smith [here](http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2000/oct/21/stevenmorris) and on this [report](http://centres.exeter.ac.uk/historyresource/resources/citizenship/lessonplans/unit4/SocietyGuardianArticle.doc)",0,1300536414,null,0,false,0,c1ld23i,t3_g6z9q,t1_c1ld23i,t3_g6z9q,1426996377,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

He's incredibly well spoken, and after I got to know him I asked him how he ended up living on the streets. He said that initially it was as the result of a bad time in his life, he got divorced and lost his house, started drinking and then lost his job.  However, now he's been living on the streets for about 8 years and says he's happy with the way things are.  He eats dinner at the shelter 6 nights a week, as well as using their showers and getting clothes from them, and for the most part sleeps rough (he said he only normally stays in the shelters when it's snowing).  He said he doesn't have to worry about all the stuff that used to concern him like mortgages, jobs, credit cards etc and he's free to spend what little money he gets in on books from charity shops.

Eventually the council, as they always do, took away her car (justifying it by saying it wasn't road legal or something) and tried to get her admitted. She then lived in a little forested bit of a park, with her rickety trolley full of old bicycles pieces and her feet wrapped in discarded plastic bags, growing increasingly ragged and wild. The park got turned into a Tescos and the forest a carpark and the little old lady was left to wander the highroad and streets aimlessly. 

She died a few years later and in a bid to find out who she was and why she was left in such desolate conditions some people traced her name and history. It turns out she was a multimillionaire, the daughter of two affluent stately home owners she had played concert violin in the thirties and forties and had married a wealthy man.

true,sk3tch,cnty-uk,London,"Did this with two mates at Glade Festival in 2006; I can honestly say it was one of the best weekends of my life. That was probably mostly due to the festival atmosphere and the sick weather but the Oxfam stewarding was great for a number of reasons:

 * 1) Free tickets (minus deposit, you get that back though, see below however).
 * 2) We had backstage wristbands which got us access to all areas, that probably doesn't happen at all festivals but meeting some DJs was a massive highlight. Standing on stage was a laugh too.
 * 3) Our supervisor was a complete mash-head and just brilliant to work with at that kind of festival.
 * 4) We got to use radios and drive around golf buggies.
 * 5) We got to camp in a private area just for the Oxfam crew with an on-site cafeteria manned 24/7, clean portaloos and HOT SHOWERS! Jesus, you don't know how good that is at a festival, makes so much difference. We could also drive our car right up to the tent which was well handy.
 * 6) As staff, security bother you a lot less. I don't think I need to expand on that.
 * 7) You can put preference down on the form about who you want to work with and hence you can just do the shifts in pairs with your mate.
 * 8) You're assigned shifts as soon as you get there but there is a massive swap-board where people can post shifts they want to swap (naturally) so you can avoid missing your favourite acts etc.

The shifts weren't that bad, I was a student back then so ticked the boxes that said I'd rather have shifts before and after the festival (aka weekdays) which meant we only had to work one 8 hour shift while the festival was actually on and we spent the most of that sat around the camp-site chatting with random people on camp-site duty. The pre-shift was guiding cars in, and the post-shift was making sure everyone left the camp site safely. One of my mates got shifted on to one of the tents during the middle shift, lucky bastard.

One thing: don't expect that deposit money back fast, I think it took about 5 months after the festival before I got it back and by the sounds of the OP's ""end of the year"" that clearly hasn't improved. 

Another thing: Glade was tiny back then, this probably isn't your typical festival steward experience.

To be fair our history lessons went back to the Roman invasions 55/4 BC, and obviously had to skip stuff. The largest amount of history covered was UK/Old world, (1066 and all that).

&gt;History is the most dangerous product which the chemistry of the mind has concocted.  Its properties are well known.  It produces dreams and drunkenness.  It fills people with false memories, exaggerates their reactions, exacerbates old grievances, torments them in their repose, and encourages either a delirium of grandeur or a delusion of persecution.

1. Early history, which is the Egyptians and the Romans. This tends to be taught to primary and early secondary school pupils and usually involves papier-mâché Egyptian monuments and trips to see mummies at the museum.

Then history gets a bit more serious…

2.The history of Britain is taught which starts at the Roman settlements in Britain (generally accompanied with a field trip to see some Roman ruins) and usually mentioning Queen Boudica.

3.The Norman invasion of England in 1066.

4.The history of the king and queens of usually focusing on King Henry VIII and Queen Elizabeth the first.

5.The English civil war is taught and everyone learns what a great man Lord Protector Cromwell was.

6.After that people learn about the industrial revolution which is a massively important part of British history and lots of time is spent on this. This will usually entail a field trip to the local museum or living history exhibit.

7.Then people learn about the formation of the British Empire.

8.After that students learn about the first and second world war. A lot of time is spent on these topics and there is usually some cross over with English literature as First World War poems and plays are (for some bizarre reason) considered classics and ‘All’s quiet on the western front’ is usually read.

9.Then we learn about the break up of the British Empire usually concentrating on India and what a great man Ghandi was. Time is spent learning about the early Indian mutiny and the salt tax.

10 . After that students learn about what is amusingly called modern Britain… that is essentially everything post world war two.

There is no room to teach the American Revolution in there. The American Revolution didn’t really harm or alter Britain in any major way so there is no reason for it to be taught.

Of course this is only true in general secondary education if British students choose to study the British Empire at a University level they learn that the American Revolution and the loss of the thirteen colonies marks the end of the ‘First British Empire’ and the begining of the ‘Second British Empire’ which marked the shift in the British Empire from the American continent to Asia and Africa.

Some of them were pagans but there were actual witches as well. Some pagans consider themselves witches and other witches actually worshipped Satan... obviously it didn't work but religious hysteria was common during the middle ages. 

The vast majority of people accused were not witches. They were unpopular or mentally ill people who became targets of the local church/community.

Middle class -   Its the kind of movie you would choose to watch, you would probably avoid reality tv and not watch soaps, you would probably be more aware of health and good diet (even if you do not follow it), its the kind of sports you would watch and play, its the conversation you would have, and the way you talk.

I think its the attitudes and behavior of a person as well.   ZOIDO (post above) seems to be middle class and have middle class mentality.
Even if he came from a family on benefit - he can be middle class based on his behaviour,   outlook, improving himself etc.

Maybe I am wrong and would appreciate other view points.....

The online application system will not fully submit an application without the full deposit.

&gt;The deposit is matched to the price of a ticket at the most expensive festival we steward at (i.e. Glastonbury) as otherwise there is no incentive for you to complete your shifts in order to get your refund.

Upper class is more than salary... being upper class generally means that you own assets that bring you an income. Hence the classic upper class owned land... while the modern upper classes tend to own real estate and stocks. 

Working class is simple to define. If you have to work everyday to support yourself you are working class.

Middle class tends to be a bit trickier but it's still simple. The middle class have a similar lifestyle to the upper class but rely on a salary to maintain it. They don't have the same wealth in assets.

2. Bombing attacks are *acts of war*, but in practice it's intervening in a civil war between two sides in Libya, not being at war *with* Libya. The Libyans themselves still have to do most of the fighting. And they aren't fighting against us, but each other.

3. It's hard to say who runs Libya at the moment. France has recognised the rebels as the official government of Libya, so it could be said that they are not at war against Libya, they are in a war together with Libya against a ""rebel ex-dictator"".

4. When most people say ""at war"", they mean two sides fighting against each other. Gaddafi isn't capable of fighting against us, we're just shooting missles at his forces from a comfortable distance.

Tbh, I don't even see the economic argument as valid. Economic considerations are just way down on the list, or rather most people have no significant control over them. Perhaps you can take it into account if you think at some point in your future you have a reasonable chance of providing a good standard of living. For most though, they don't have a good standard of living now, never will have, and so there is simply no point putting it off. It's also perfectly normal for someone to want to have children even when they are bringing that child into a lifetime of hardship, and much more brutal hardship than they're likely to get in this country too. Most evidence points to rates of reproduction increasing in response to environmental hardship, not vice versa. If it were morally wrong to bring a child into the world that you could not comfortably support, then where would that leave a mother the third world, or our ancestors?

true,Sacharified,uk,Esher,"&gt;People don't need to go to art galleries, or to read books in the library, or enjoy a stroll in a public park. Of course, some people want to do these things, and our society provides for them the facilities so they can do it (for free).
You say it's not possible to not use an automobile, but I disagree. It is entirely possible, but we wouldn't be able to do it without significantly changing our lifestyles.
So if you are going to call having children morally wrong, then you could at least apply the same thought process to the countless things we do as a society which also have a negative impact on our lives, be it via our wallets, or health, or our personal freedoms.

We might not *have* to use a car, but people need jobs and they need food, and in places with poor public transport, its unrealistic to assume that its always realistic to not need a car to access those things. Just thinking about where some of my relatives live, it would be basically impossible for them to have access to jobs or groceries without a car. Even then, there's a *big* tax on oil which, in a way, serves to mitigate some of the negative environmental impact. 

Galleries, museums, libraries and parks are all public resources. Everyone can use them and there's a distinction to be made there between that and child benefits. Furthermore, AFAIK, libraries and parks are paid for by council tax, so individuals have a little more control and influence over laws regarding those. 

You never need a child and your child is not a public resource. That's where the distinction here is. 

&gt;We should educate ourselves (as a society) and solve problems at their root cause, not just go around making new laws in an attempt to bodge our social problems.

I totally agree. Throwing legislation at social issues is never the answer and only serves to create more problems. Improving education is an obvious way to help get the next generation off the dole and in to better jobs, but even if that can be done, what do we do with a current generation of welfare queens? Just wait for them to die? 
Perhaps some kind of incentive program could be implemented.

Smith, though, (and I'll add that this is only my opinion, and in no way to be taken as incontrovertible truth) looks superficially just enough like Tennant, and in the first couple of episodes, used just enough similar expressions and voice quirks, that there's room for comparison.

I think too many people haven't let go enough to see that transition, and the incredible talent behind it.

They sparkle when he knows something good is happening.  They smirk when he's outsmarting someone.

Why on earth are we combining faith and education?  That's the most retarded idea i've ever heard!!!!

My beef with the faith school system actually comes close to home for me.

My daughter in a few years will be at schooling age and what used to be our local school 'Lea Valley' is now the [Iqra Islamic school](http://www.iqraslough.co.uk/schoolinfo.html)
 
I personally would prefer my daughter not to go to an Islamic school. I am not against peoples beliefs (as daft as they appear to me sometimes) or privately funded faith schools, but its not something we as parents want for  our child. I feel it unfair that we now have one less school to send our daughter to due to this appeasement we have towards 'faith' schools.

It's for this reason we are moving out of the area, well that and the fact that Slough is a shithole too ;-)

You mean like the US and NATO did with Tunisia and Egypt and are doing with Yemen, Bahrain (where US 5th fleet is based), Syria and Saudi Arabia?

The hypocrisy of the US and NATO's pretext for the attacks on Libya know no depths. Their claim that the attacks are based on humanitarian concerns, when between them they have invaded, occupied and installed oppressive regimes in Iraq and Afghanistan who tolerate no opposition at all and have done this at the cost of thousands upon thousands of deaths. Not to mention Guantanamo Bay, flights of rendition and the torture and murder of civilians in Iraq and Afghanistan.

In addition the 'Allies' continually support Israel in its attacks on the Palestinians and do not show any inclination of 'intervening' in this case. It is also worth noting how the Americans and NATO ignore the objections of the Arab League when it comes to Israel attacking Palestine but conveniently exploit them when it comes to justifying their 'wars of aggression'.

This war is about oil and geo-political positioning of US and NATO troops to suppress the spreading revolutions in the oil rich region of North Africa and the Middle East. 

&gt;Is it possible to have anything else apart from a 'war of aggression'?

A 'war of aggression' while some appear to think 'might be fun' is a military conflict waged without the justification of self-defense usually for territorial gain and subjugation. The phrase is distinctly modern and diametrically opposed to the prior legal international standard of ""might makes right"", under the medieval and pre-historic beliefs of right of conquest. Since the Korean War of the early 1950s, waging such a war of aggression is a crime under the customary international law. It is generally agreed by scholars in international law that the military actions of the Nazi regime in World War II in its search for so-called ""Lebensraum"" are characteristic of a war of aggression, the waging of which was called the supreme crime by Justice Robert H. Jackson, chief prosecutor for the United States at the Nuremberg Trials

Driving a car is a convienience that opens up many more options in life, but it is not a neccesity for life.

&gt; You never need a child and your child is not a public resource. That's where the distinction here is.

Many people do ""need"" a child, in the same way some people ""need"" to drive a car. It's something in life they consider to be unrealistic to deny themselves. A sacrifice they cannot comprehend making, because it would change their lives in such a massive way.

How can you say that people don't need to bring up a child, an act which is probably one of the greatest things many people do in their lives, yet still maintain that people ""need"" to drive a car so they can live in the country and work in the city? 

It's amusing that you try to justify automobiles by bringing up the tax on petrol. Firstly, it doesn't mitigate the effect on the environment (or our lungs), it provides money to fund our society. Secondly, how can you not see that a child will provide much more to our soceity than a mere tax on petrol? These children could grow up to be the people who fix your toilet when it leaks, or producers of the art you enjoy, or the music you like. They could be soldiers fighting on the front line for your ""freedoms"", or educators teaching the next generation of children. They might be the next generation of doctors in the NHS, or the nurses who wipe our asses when we are stuck in the nursing home. And all the while they will pay the taxes everyone else pays, probably adding more economically than the tax on petrol.

&gt; your child is not a public resource.

I consider a person to be public resource, as they make up part of our soceity. Furthermore, they are infinitely more beneficial to our soceity than parks or libraries, regardless of their social background.

&gt; Perhaps some kind of incentive program could be implemented.

Indeed.

That depends on how you define ""corporation"".

Public schools don't get that income, they have to raise the money through fees so they live and die by their reputation.

true,BonzoTheBoss,eng-Cheshire,Cheshire,"As mentioned by other comments, the term 'War of Agression' does not really apply when sanctioned by the UNSC.

The truth is that international relations are extremely complex, with a myriad of factors to consider both at home and abroad. First we must consider the Middle Eastern uprisings over the past several months. The events in Egypt and Tunisia didn't require foreign intervention because those revolutions were (to my understanding) relatively bloodless. The people revolted, and the national armies refused to fire upon its own people, thus resulting in the deposing of their respective autocratic leaders. It is both difficult and ultimately futile to debate if there would have been foreign intervention had their uprisings followed a similar suit to that in Libya, had civilians been killed and their leaders not resigned peacefully. The fact is that Gaddafi forces have been confirmed to have attacked and have been attacking civilian populations. You can argue that these populations are now armed, however they were not originally. I think we can all agree it is the right of the people to arm themselves in self defence against a murderous government.

Next we must consider popular opinion. As imperfect as it is, the modern media does not cover all world events equally (e.g. the fact that many in Japan are starving and Japan has been devastated by the tsunami, yet the majority of coverage only concerns the events dealing with nuclear issues). Media coverage affects popular opinion. the UN governments know that Libya has been covered more than other events, thus by focusing their efforts on Libya they ensure the majorative support of their people. We also cannot deny the potential influence of regional resources, specifically oil. I suspect this was a factor in deciding military action, if for no other reason than to expedite Gaddafi's fall so that oil exports may continue asap. Having said that, this does not make the intervening action wrong (Gaddafi really IS trying to wipe the rebels out), it just suggests there may have been extra motive to select Libya for the supporting of revolutionary elements.

Thirdly we must consider political positions. This links in closely with the last point in that media coverage dictates a lot of what the public percieves. I cannot deny that there are ulterior motives behind a lack of intervention in other nations, be it subtle support of the current regime for whatever purpose, or they simply aren't compelled to act based on popular opinion being focused elsewhere. This way the UN nations get to present the public with a ""victory"" for human rights and they're seen as opposing tyranny, whilst at the same time can maintain relations with other autocratic powers without seeming the ""bad guys"" and expending resources in other foreign interventions.

This leads to my next point; resources. As powerful the collective military power is of the UN and NATO, those resources are ultimately limited. I am no military tactician, but I would surmise that it is extremely difficult to run concurrent interventionary offensive campaigns against multiple nations. Our resources are not unlimited. that doesn't mean we should not still be concerned with human rights and the promoting of democracy in other nations, however for the time being we cannot afford to over-reach.

There is always the possibility that if (when?) Gaddafi is deposed there will be further UN sanctions against other nations with subsequent military action (as once Libya is no longer in the head lines, the media may give greater focus to the likes of Bahrain, thus swaying public perception), however at this moment there is no timeline for operations in and against pro-Gaddafi forces. There is also the possibility that the autocratic leaders will see what has happened in Libya when governments murder their own people and be persuaded to resign of their own free will, like in Tunisia and Egypt. Only time will tell.

Ultimately I think it is unfair to judge this decision based on previous actions. I feel this situation is unique in that (unlike in Afghanistan and Iraq) there such a huge international support for this action. If this does lead to the exploitation of Libya then yes, I will be right there at the front of the protest march, but until then I say we wait and see what we will see, and accept the reasoning for the action as the protection of human life (which they most definitely need protecting from Gaddafi, Benghazi would have been wiped out by now).

Exactly, so why were you raised Catholic? You were pretty much told what to believe from a young age and I *believe* that to be wrong and if I can do anything to help that situation, then it should be where my tax money is going towards. Unfortunately I can't influence where my tax money is going without others of the United Kingdom trying to do that same and to stop lying to themselves about their relgious affiliation.

I went to a Christian school, I was Christened, but does that make me Christian? Not one bit! But unfortunately people still believe that it does even when they do not share the beliefs of said religion. You may ask what the harm in people saying that they're religious is, when they're not actually religious and are at best agnostic, well when as a majority they have the ability to prevent the indoctrination of children who know no better, to force a seperation of church and government and they simply stand aside, they may as well be there telling those children that if they don't follow religion X then they're going to hell where they will be tortured and burn for the rest of eternity.

Now there is nothing that we can do immediately to stop private state school, but I do not want to see my money being spent on things such as faith schools.

true,BonzoTheBoss,eng-Cheshire,Cheshire,"Are we argueing on completely different issues here? The reason I said you were being ""picky"" is because you were ignoring the wider issue that is action in Libya, which is what my main post was all about. It was my interpretation that you instead were being overly sensative to the strictest definition of ""war of agression"". I conceded that point but put forth that this ""war of agression"" does not necessarily mean it is the wrong course of action (to the end of protecting Libyan civilians from Gaddafi forces).

You then say that the action in Libya is currently illegal. I countered this by saying it is not, as it has been sanctioned by the ""wider international community"", specifically the UN and the Arab League. This essentially means that practically EVERYONE agreed it was necessary to protect civilians in Libya by imposing a no-fly zone (which required Gaddafi anti-aitcraft defences to be taken out) and neutralizing Gaddafi forces engaged or attempting to engage civilian populations. At this point I invite you to argue why, despite the sanctioning of the international community, this action is illegal. To clarify; illegal in the sense that there was no reason (which there is, and has been clearly stated), and was unsanctioned by the international community (which it has been). Otherwise please stop proclamating ""You're defending an illegal war!"" 

You seem to be missing my point entirely, what I'm saying is that military action is sometimes necessary to safeguard those who cannot defend themselves. By your definition Britain going against Germany was a ""war of agression"", however it was ultimately justified because the Nazi's and Hitler were monsters who were commiting genocide. Likewise here, I feel it will be ultimately justified because Gaddafi was (and still could be) killing civilians and would have slautered the inhabitants of Benghazi had we not intervened.

I just see faith as a personal choice.  But one also has to understand brain development to know how inappropriate it is to immerse children in religious educations.  It amounts to child abuse because it is imprinting something on the brain before the brain is capable of fully understanding the concepts.

All that says is that a lack of UN sanction isn't enough alone to make it a war of aggression. Some wars that aren't self defence or UN mandated are not wars of aggression. It even goes on to explain the types of scenario where this might be the case.

&gt; certain wars may be unlawful but not aggressive (a war to settle a boundary dispute where the initiator has a reasonable claim, and limited aims, is one example).

However all wars of aggression lack UN sanction. It is a legal construct designed specifically in that way.

&gt; Article 39 of the United Nations Charter provides that the UN Security Council shall determine the existence of any act of aggression and ""shall make recommendations, or decide what measures shall be taken in accordance with Articles 41 and 42, to maintain or restore international peace and security"".

I.E. the UNSC decides what is and isn't an act of aggression. The very fact it has sanctioned the war is a prima facie demonstration that this isn't a war of aggression.

&gt; You tell me!? Your the one defending this war and still cant explain why the US and NATO have intervened in Libya but not in Bahrain, Yemen etc etc and did not intervene in Egypt or Tunisia.

Because there is no UN mandate to do so. We mistakenly invaded Iraq without a UN mandate. We should not repeat that mistake in other nations.

We only got a UN mandate in this case because the Arab League supported it and asked for the UN to intervene. The Arab League would not support intervention in these cases.

true,crazylilting,welsh,Wales,"&gt;Much of the bad stuff is down to what was accepted at the time, but to dismiss the whole message of the bible is missing the point I think. Now, I'm not saying that to have these values you must be religious, just highlighting that a lot of people may still want to propagate them through religion and why shouldn't they be allowed to do so?

Ok lets look at this since you've brought it up.  What do we want our children to learn?  Do onto others as you would have them do onto you?  What kind of rubbish is this?  This does not teach appropriate responses to destructive behaviours.  Sure it sounds nice but in practice you would become a door mat for everyone who doesn't believe as you do.  And lets look at the very basis to the belief.  Accepting Jesus as your personal saviour so that you will not burn for an eternity for your sins.  Wow just wow!  Where does one begin?  This teaches children that there is no earthy consequences for transgressions because our life on earth is just a blip in time, a testing ground to see if you will submit to god to be with him for the rest of eternity.  Victims of any crime will see just how messed up this concept is.

I would further point out that the bad in the bible is swept under the holy carpet to keep religion alive.  We are evolving morally and mentally and the more we do so the less gods word becomes relevant.  The bible talks of love but is so limited and conditional that it is a completely irrelevant book on the subject.  Even if you cut out all the bad things in the bible what does it really teach about love?  Love is blind?  Well that's a problem for a start....  What about forgiveness?  hmmm... what a messed up concept that is.  In real life there is no such thing.  Actions have consequences that are so far reaching that years of therapy are often needed to undo the damage of toxic parenting and relationships.  Forgiveness is like forgetting and forgetting opens the door for further abuse.  The bible had no understanding of the human psyche or if it did knew just how much fear was needed to control others.

I fail to see how just doing something because it is the thing to do is culture.  I think people are so far removed from culture that they no longer know what it is.  If you go to an indigenous tribe you will find that they have a ""way of life"" a way of being in the world and relating to it that defines their culture.  We see such things as important to preserve because they differ so much from the rest of the world.  When you have a population that is so diverse as our modern ones culture is nothing.  It's a homogenized clone that could be found anywhere in the world and isn't worth preserving because there is nothing of real value or identity that would be destroyed.

As for the Jesus thing, again it depends on you want to present religion - again, I said elsewhere on my thread my mum hated the church and how it glorified penitence and suffering and because of the way it portrayed God as this fear inticing figure.

The Bible. Oh that's a biggie isn't it? Firstly I disagree with how you perceive forgiveness, but that's a personal thing. And that's the point, religion, values, faith this is all inherently personal beliefs. I had so many friends who were religious but perceived and interpreted religion in different ways. So attacking faith from the bible perspective is on itself problematic because so many people see in so many different ways. Personally, I used to see it as a way in which people explained what they did not understand - a series of myths with a moral backbone on values you should live your life by. 

You perceiving culture as something far too static. My parents baptized me not because of the religious meaning, but the meaning they chose to give to the cerimony - bringing the family together, celebrating their children and making people who were so close to them part of the family. Cultural meaning is fluid and changes constantly, who are you to say that people are allowed to carry on their traditions or not? Who are you to define what is valuable and what isn't?

Punishing children to the third and fourth generation for rejecting him. The people worshipping other gods aren't confused, and punishing their unborn great grand-children is fucked up. It starts with mentioning a the myth of Exodus and again later, it's ahistorical, it didn't happen. He calls himself ""Lord"" and later you cannot misuse his name, or blaspheme. You cannot say a thing against him, other figures associated with him, or places. It's such a great display of pride, then demands for worship and obedience, even though God has been acting like a complete shit throughout the books before it.

I've heard the ""it's about confusion"" defence before, and it seems to be what a lot of schools tell children it's about, and I'm sure they don't actually teach the ten commandments as they're written. Most children don't know much about what's in the Bible, faith school or not. These people just cherry pick things out of it. Of course half the stuff indoctrinated to children by Christian denominations isn't in the Bible at all.

It was never about land armies but naval supremacy in the 19th Century; every country across the world was influenced by the foreign policy of the British Empire.

That's not to totally diminish the capability or importance of the British army on land, although it WAS the great land wars which weakened our position, our army was also important. Naval supremacy though was the foundation of the power of the British Empire.

To piss off Britain meant possible trade embargos and trade lane disruption; colonial powers really wouldn't want that. Germany in the late 1890's recognised that the only naval power that was worth challenging was the British. France tried to pressure Britain into restricting the expansion and unification of Germany in the 1870's. The United States during the Napoleonic Wars recognised after being defeated by Britain in a seperate war that they needed a stronger navy.

true,generic_human_1979,null,null,"For the past couple of generations, society (at least, in the West) has been in a position that is unique in human history, in that we're largely removed from the natural order of things. This goes beyond advances in modern medicine and science, reducing mortality rates and increasing lifespans, and has to do with selection based on behaviour. If you look at social animal groups, there is a great deal of cooperation that increases their chance of survival as a group. Predators hunt together and share the kill, herbivores group together to protect the young, etc. But, within all that, there's also a tendency for groups to favour certain behaviours above others. Those who don't contribute as much to the hunt, but try to claim a larger share of the food, are often put in their place by the rest of the group. A more brutal form of this is adandoning the runt of a litter, since it will only be another mouth to feed and not be able to contribute, or may even slow the group down. Humans have always done this too, even up to modern times (not talking about abandoning the sick or the infirm, but about looking down on certain behaviour). If you were poor, your survival depended on your hard work, or the help of others such as family or friends. If you fell on hard times, you'd rely on your friends and family to help support you, and you'd do the same for them... but if you were a dick to everyone you knew, or if you were lazy and wouldn't pull your weight, you'd find help much less available. The same is true today for some things, but now there's an added party... the State. Now, it doesn't matter how you behave to people around you, you're no longer dependent on them for your survival if you're in trouble. The availability of government support is there whatever you do (short of criminal behaviour) so it means those people who have cut themselves off from help from their immediate community by being lazy/arseholes no longer have any serious, potentially life threatening consequences to that.

I might be sounding cynical about the whole thing, but let me stress that this is a good thing. Although it allows selfish behaviour, it also disallows personal prejudice in the allocation of help. It's a fine line between ""I don't want to help because you're an arsehole"" and ""I don't want to help because you're different"". This is really a big experiment, because no one really knows how this will affect the course of society long-term. It's only been taking place for a couple of generations, but it's inevitable that people will take a look at the way things are, and the system in place, as time goes on and want to refine it. On principle, I'm totally against the idea of the state interfering with peoples personal lives through legislation, or through withholding benefits. If an unemployed/unemployable couple decide to have six kids, I wouldn't favour any kind of caps to their benefits, because I don't believe that children are responsible for their parents. They have no control over the circumstances they've been brought into, and the best hope they have is to have as 'normal' a childhood as possible if they're to grow into well-adjusted adults... society making them live on the breadline because their parents are lazy certainly won't help that...

...but, this is the real world, and resources are finite. If people abuse the system, eventually the system won't be able to cope, and change will be inevitable. Take a look at the gradual abolition of state-paid-for university, or the slow erosion of the NHS that could lead to privatisation of health care in this country. When the cash runs out (not going to get into a debate as to whether it has or not, but that image is certainly being promoted) things that were once sacred suddenly look less so, and the good that they do gradually loses it's appeal next to the costs they incur. If everyone had as many kids as they wanted, with no regards to the costs, then the benefits bill could climb, resulting in several outcomes, none of which are pleasant:

* Taxes go up to pay for it. Take more from the 'haves' to give to the 'have nots'. This makes sense superficially to preserve the system, but is it really fair? True, some tax avoiders should be paying their fair share, but for the rest of the working population, most of which have their own families to support, taking more from them isn't really fair. Also, the 'haves' (by this, I don't mean the rich, I mean anyone who works and pays tax) have more influence, being that there are more of them, and they'd probably resist this.
* The money gets spread more thinly. Everyone gets a little less, everyone struggles a little harder, including those who have been responsible and who have worked hard, but have found themselves in the situation that they need extra help. Many people who claim aren't unemployed, they just don't earn enough to support themselves. Ideally wages would be enough to support a family, but again, reality...
* You take benefits away from certain people (ie, those deemed to be 'abusing the system'). This might seem like the most fair option, but this leaves things open for innocent people to get caught in the crossfire, such as the children of the abusers, and anyone who is wrongly determined to be abusing.
* People take responsibility for themselves and try to reduce their burden on the system, so that it never gets to this stage in the first place. This could be as simple as always actively looking for work, and waiting until you have an income before starting a family.

...no prizes for guessing which of these options I prefer, and I don't think it's a lot to ask. I'm sure you'll probably think to yourself that no one has any right to dictate to you how and when to have children, and you'd be right, but when you're expecting everyone else to foot all the bills, it seems more than a tad selfish not to bear that in mind when you make the decision.",0,1300752249,null,0,false,0,c1lpuca,t3_g7kon,t1_c1lpuca,t1_c1lp8n9,1427002535,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

In the meantime there will be all sorts of frantic activity going on behind the scenes to try to work out what's happening on the ground and who or what would be most likely to replace him in the event that his government was overthrown. Approaches will be made to different groups to see which is most amenable to our interests and we'll end up backing them. In the event that there's nobody suitable around at the moment, coalition forces will try to keep Gaddafi on a short leash until someone is found. 

I cannot see him being replaced until a successor is found who opens the country's oilfields to Western contractors- unless the Libyans do it for themselves.

Now, obviously, one cannot put the blame squarely on Lucas in those instances. And while I have my doubts about Lucas, I have to concede that he is still a young player with a lot of upside and has shown quite a bit of improvement over the season.

That being said, it does appear as if a player like Charlie Adam can offer a bit more creativity and excitement on a more consistent basis.

As for Gerrard, I personally would like to see him as more of an attacking/roaming midfielder.

I hear Aquilani has been doing quite well in Italy (though, I've not watched him in any matches). So it would be very interesting to see him come back into the fold.

Libya appears to be a situation where the West thinks that limited force could achieve limited aims with reasonable chance of political fallout being containable. Darfur, as far as I can tell would involve chasing round in the desert after small armed groups that would be hard to distinguish from civilians without putting in a large occupying force on the ground. This has not worked out so well for local civilians the last couple of times we tried it and I am not sure where we would have staged or supplied a ground force from. 

In short,  the fact that the motivation of the governments that we want to act for us may be suspect does not change whether a particular intervention is practical.

For a start, while there leaders were dictators, they also had some semblance of sanity! They realised there was no way to effectively win so they stepped down, hence why those revolutions were successful. Gaddafi is insane, and is convinced he's going down fighthing as a martyr.

Next there's the military. In Tunisia and Egypt both times the national army refused to turn against its own people, which effectively solidified the revolutions. In Libya it's completely different, primarily because Libya doesn't have an effective national army, Gaddafi purposely kept them weak fearing a military coup (citation [here](http://www.npr.org/2011/03/10/134404618/gadhafis-military-muscle-concentrated-in-elite-units)). Instead he's using elite troops loyal (possibly actively indoctrinated) only to him, and hired mercenaries from Africa, both of whom have no problem gunning down Libyan civilians.

The point is that if we'd have just left them to ""overthrow this despot"", they'd all be dead by now. Not just dead, massacred, slaughtered, butchered, plus any other colourful words that Gaddafi would do to them. Then once the rebels were dealt with, Gaddafi would have solidified his power and yes, began exporting that prescious oil again.

But can you imagine what living under Gaddafi would be like after the uprising was crushed?

true,BonzoTheBoss,eng-Cheshire,Cheshire,"Once again you seem either unwilling or incapable of understanding what I was trying to get at.

Complicated foreign policy in intervening in other nations is affected by public opinion. Public opinion is swayed by what people see in the media. The media, at present, is concentrated on Libya, so it stands to reason that the coaltion nations will focus their efforts on Libya first. That's all I was saying.

International support is VITAL to any military intervention. Without it, as you rightly put, it becomes a war of agression, in every definition. And without the support of the Arab League, there wouldn't be any help for the civilians in Libya at all. Fact. That doesn't mean that it isn't right to intervene in other countries facing pro-democracy difficulties, but for the time being we need to tread lightly. Alienating the eastern world won't help our cause, it will only hinder it, resulting in greater cost in resources and human lives.

International relations are extremely complex, as much as you try to supposition that the US and NATO can and does invade everyone at will, it's never as clear cut as that. I concede the point about Bahrain being the base for the 5th fleet, there is obviously a wider political issue to consider there. If the US were to become hostile to Bahrain they're effectively cutting off their nose to spite their face. i.e. They'd be in a prime position to lose large military assets very quickly, so you're right, they're not going to do that right away.

The only irony here is that fact that you seem unwilling or unable to see the facts in front of you, or appreciate the wider global repercussions that will be generated by casting away popular opinion and international support.

If this is true, the kettle was not used to contain small groups of protesters who the police allege were behaving improperly, but to intentionally include those not suspected of any fault. Even if the purpose of the kettle was legitimate, it would still have to be necessary and proportionate. If the police genuinely believed some of the protestors posed a threat to public safety, how can they justify exposing vulnerable young people to such a danger?""

&gt;The UEFA Champions League titleholder is guaranteed a place in the group stage even if it does not qualify for the competition through its domestic championship.

This is the general rule. Then you find subsections a and b, which would apply to the Premier League:

&gt;a) If the titleholder comes from an association entitled to four places in the UEFA Champions League and qualifies for the UEFA Europa League 
through its domestic competitions, the lowest-ranked club of the 
association’s UEFA Champions League representatives is automatically 2 
transferred to the UEFA Europa League  (into the latest possible round 
where there is a vacancy). In this case, the number of places to which the titleholder's national association is entitled in the UEFA Champions 
League and the UEFA Europa League does not change.

&gt;b) If the titleholder comes from an association entitled to four places in the UEFA Champions League and does not qualify for the UEFA Champions League or UEFA Europa League through its domestic competitions, the lowest-ranked club of the association’s UEFA Champions League representatives is automatically transferred to the UEFA Europa League (into the latest possible round where there is a vacancy). In this case, the national association of the titleholder is entitled to one additional place in the UEFA Europa League.

So in no way can there be an additional spot in the Champions League granted. If Spurs/Chelsea were to win CL and finish the season in 5th (scenario A), then they would get the CL spot, and the 4th place team would get the Europa League spot along with Birmingham and Stoke/Bolton. If Spurs/Chelsea win CL and finish 6th or worse, then they would get the 4th CL spot, and BOTH the 4th and 5th place teams join Europa League, along with Birmingham and Bolton/Stoke.

There is no scenario where we can qualify for Europe without finishing 5th. ",0,1300809251,null,0,false,0,c1lt42t,t3_g8gde,t1_c1lt42t,t1_c1lsyqs,1427004149,2,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,2

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt; but, this is the real world, and resources are finite. If people abuse the system, eventually the system won't be able to cope, and change will be inevitable. Take a look at the gradual abolition of state-paid-for university, or the slow erosion of the NHS that could lead to privatisation of health care in this country. 

You see the problems but do not ascribe to them the correct cause. The poor are not responsible for the slow destruction of the state in the last 30 years. We still have some of lowest levels of unemployment since the war, the lowest levels of social housing and the most stringent unemployment benefits. The reason everything is progressively getting worse, is that a greater and greater percentage of those finite resources are being pooled into the hands of an ever shrinking percentage of the population. 

&gt; Taxes go up to pay for it. Take more from the 'haves' to give to the 'have nots'. This makes sense superficially to preserve the system, but is it really fair?

The fact that there are 'haves' and 'have nots' is what is unfair. The cause of relative poverty is rooted in our system of capitalism. Taxes are designed to compensate for that unfairness, but fall short. Is it fair to tax people who earn much much more than they could use to pay for people who work much harder for less than they need? Of course it is.

&gt; ..no prizes for guessing which of these options I prefer,

Considering you are a guy who believes the man-made system of capitalism should be compared to lion hunts and monkey politics, and the victims of other peoples greed should be considered as 'runts', I simply don't care which you prefer.

Faith schools are for indoctrination and there is nothing you can say that would change that ""fact""

&gt;The Catholic Education Service, responsible for about 2,200 schools and sixth form colleges with a total of 720,000 pupils, said it would be wrong for the government to withdraw funding for faith schools or to prevent new ones.  Parents had a right to choose an education in sympathy with their ethos, said a spokesman. Many Catholic schools were oversubscribed and were judged successful by Ofsted inspectors. ""It would be particularly damaging to prevent communities opening new schools as many are situated in deprived areas where the church demonstrates its commitment to the poor,"" he said.

http://www.guardian.co.uk/education/2011/feb/02/westminster-vaughan-memorial-school-catholic

&gt;They (parents) fear officials want to ""change the way the school operates, dilute its Catholic ethos and turn it into a local comprehensive"", and are fighting for greater parental involvement in the running of the school. They are planning a candlelit protest outside its west London premises tonight.

Regardless of what you think, faith schools are run by churches.  They are a breading ground for isolation and fundamentalism and do not integrate students into the full society.  They promote exclusion and indoctrinate our children into religions.  So many UK citizens think they are Christian when in fact they are not, they just identify themselves as Christian because of the way they were brought up.  That is indoctrination, plain and simple.  It skews the statistics of special interest groups and gives churches power that they would not have, diverting tax money into the church coffers instead of our educational system.

I went to many schools growing up, some christian and some public.  The public schools did not breed culture.  How can they, when students come from all walks of life?  It is not their place to do so.  They simply instill values like inclusion, and values that are mandated in the Universal declaration of human rights as they should.  The Christian school however (Dutch Reform) was a complete nightmare instilling christian based values that were not inclusive and teach people that they are bad by nature and need to be saved from themselves.

1. lignite

2. bituminous coal

We've used most of the anthracite. So when they say ""there is 7 bnt of coal left"", what exactly do they mean? Is that all three types? In what proportions? Is it just the antracite? If so, why didnt they include the rest?

I have the feeling that the ROI for coal is much lower now than it was in, say, 1850.

true,beard-maketh-the-man,eng-yorkshire,Yorkshire,"&gt;I have to comment on this article, primarily because it has so spectacularly missed the point of the series and misrepresented my views on the importance of science, engineering and human progress. I'll do so by posting a few paragraphs from the Wonders of the Universe book, which Mr O'Neill would do well to read.
&gt;
&gt;From the introduction:
&gt;
&gt;The scientific project is ultimately modest: It doesn’t seek universal truths and it doesn’t seek absolutes; it simply seeks to understand, and therein lies its power and value. Science has given us the modern world, of that there can be no doubt. It has improved our lives beyond measure; increased life expectancy, decreased child mortality, eradicated many diseases and rendered many more impotent. It has given many of us the gift of time, freed us from the drudgery of mere survival and allowed us to open our minds and explore. Science is therefore a virtuous circle, its discoveries creating more time and wealth that we can, if we are wise, invest in further voyages of exploration and discovery. But for all its undoubted usefulness, I maintain that science is fuelled not by utilitarian desire but by curiosity. The exploration of the universe and its wonders is as important as the search for new medical treatments, new energy sources or new technologies, because ultimately all these valuable advances rest on an understanding of the basic laws that govern everything in nature, from atoms to black holes and everything in-between. This is why curiosity driven science is the most valuable of pursuits, and this is why we must continue our journey into the darkness.
&gt;
&gt;And from the last page:
&gt;
&gt;As the great astronomer Carl Sagan wrote:
&gt;
&gt;“It has been said that astronomy is a humbling and character-building experience. There is perhaps no better demonstration of the folly of human conceits than this distant image of our tiny world. To me, it underscores our responsibility to deal more kindly with one another, and to preserve and cherish the pale blue dot, the only home we've ever known.”
&gt;
&gt;Just as we and all life on Earth stand on this tiny speck adrift in infinite space, so life in the universe will only exist for a fleeting, dazzling instant in infinite time, because life, just like the stars, is a temporary structure on the long road from order to disorder. 
&gt;
&gt;But that doesn’t make us insignificant, because life is the means by which the Universe can understand itself, if only for an instant. And this is what we’ve done in our brief moments on Planet Earth. We have sent space probes to the edge of our solar system and beyond; we have built telescopes that can glimpse the oldest and most distant stars and we have discovered and understood at least some of the natural laws that govern the cosmos. This, ultimately, is why I believe we’re important. Our true significance lies in our continuing desire to understand and explore this beautiful Universe

I remember when TV had learning programmes broadcast in the daytime slot - I think it was BBC2. I used to watch them in school. They were things to do with science and languages. Looking at today's TV schedule:

BBC1:

9:15am 	Heir Hunters   
10:00am 	Homes Under the Hammer   
11:00am 	Britain's Empty Homes   
11:30am 	Cash in the Attic   
12:15pm 	Bargain Hunt    

Don't get me wrong, as a university student I could have sat there and watched all of them. But if they're looking to cut costs somewhere, then to me adding more Open University programmes or signed programmes during the day would make more sense. You'd have to record them anyway, I'm assuming if you held down a full time job, 3am is not the ideal time to watch TV.

Might even helped those that are retired or older; they'd be able to watch educational programmes to keep their brains going.

BBC2:

9:25am 	Big Barn Farm   
9:40am 	Little Human Planet   
9:45am 	Timmy Time   
9:55am 	3rd and Bird   
10:05am 	Postman Pat: Special Delivery Service   
10:20am 	Pingu   
10:25am 	64 Zoo Lane   
10:40am 	Waybuloo   
11:00am 	In the Night Garden   
11:30am 	Budget   
3:30pm 	Flog it! Travels Around Britain   
3:45pm 	Helicopter Heroes   

Ok, this is a bit of a different one, because of the Budget today. But all those CBeebies programmes? First, there's the CBeebies channel. Second, the little horrors shouldn't be watching that much TV anyway. ;) But really, there are other workarounds people could use (videos, DVDs are exceptionally cheap from charity shops) if they need the TV to briefly babysit.

Just, to me, if the BBC do need to cut costs (although Mark Thompson, if you cared, you might have your salary lowered a bit) - the early hours could be one of the more flexible times.

Having worked in insurance, the real cost of your insurance if you are young is caused by boy racers who crash into people causing them personal injury.  If you crash into someone and they are unable to perform their job any more, the insurance company is liable for loss of earnings and potential loss of future earnings.  If you kill someone, think of the pay out that their family are going to have to get.

I've mentioned before that when I worked for First Alternative we had a couple of £million plus claims in a year.  These were offset because your insurance is re-insured by another company who pick up the high claims, but if there are too many then they put their premiums up and it gets passed on to the customer.

Protecting children from abuse and neglect should of course be a societal priority. The unfortunate downside to this though is that the collective instinct to protect children sometimes targets those who aren't a real threat, which includes those who are attracted to children but have the self control to never act on their impulses. There's no way of knowing proportionally how many paedophiles fall in to this category, since they're unlikely to be truthful to a survey and so the paedophiles we know about are the ones who've abused or attempted to abuse children. Therefore, it is understandable that society automatically assumes someone who's attracted to children will act on this. The urge to protect the innocence of childhood also explains why child killers (like the killers of Jamie Bulger for instance) are so much more reviled than adult killers, because they subvert notions of innocence and consequently appear monstrous and other.

The variability of the age of consent between countries shows that it's not a cut and dried argument as to what it should be, but all countries whose ages of consent I'm aware of have it as 12 or older, that is, after puberty has begun for the majority of children.

true,[deleted],null,null,"Spoilers abound! Stupidly long wall of text ahead. It... got away from me.

Speaking as a Ten fan, I think a very large part of Ten is *loneliness*. He is unwilling to let go of the people he travels with and grows fond of, but fate always conspires to drag them away from him... with Rose, it was her hold on the gravity clamp slipping, with Martha it was the Year That Never Was (which was, let's face it, partially his fault) and with Donna it was the DoctorDonna burning her up. He loves and maybe needs to surround himself with friends; perhaps his happiest moment was in Journey's End, with the TARDIS filled with his extended family, the Children of Time. He does feel immensely guilty over everyone who has sacrificed themselves to save him, shown by his reaction to Davros' accusations. His last words, ""I don't wanna go"", could reflect this part of him - he's scared, he's lonely, and despite visiting ALL his past companions (confirmed in Sarah Jane Adventures, when Eleven states he visited every companion he ever had) he still ends up dying by himself. Possibly this came as a result of Rose being forcefully taken away from him. Having the woman you love ripped away by the Void and separated by an entire universe can't possibly be good for your psyche. He is so desperate for permanent companionship he is willing to forgive the Master everything, if only he will travel with Ten. This is a guy whose crimes are genocide, the decimation of the Earth (i.e. killing off a tenth of the population), creating a particularly nasty paradox, viciously torturing Jack Harkness nonstop for a year, imprisoning Martha's family, keeping the Doctor as a literal pet, turning Japan into a nuclear wasteland and Rassilon knows what else, and let's not get started with the classic series. That's why I thought that the end of Last of the Time Lords was particularly poignant, even with the Crystal Dragon Tinkerbell Jesus Doctor earlier. He craves a companion of his own species that he will forgive everything; the Master refusing to regenerate is truly his final victory.

We can see how and why he needs companions in the Specials. As Donna said, waaaaay back in The Runaway Bride, ""Sometimes, I think you need someone to stop you."" Nowhere is this more evident than in The Waters of Mars, where the Doctor finally snaps and declares himself ""Time Lord Victorious"". He is so sick and tired of watching good people have to die for the sake of the timeline that he takes it upon himself to lord over the progression of History, changing it as he sees fit. The problem is, Adelaide is disgusted by his attitude towards the ""big people"" and the ""little people""; he seemingly no longer cares about individual humans, which has always been a trait of the Doctor. Perhaps she is even more disgusted by the fact that he expects her to thank him or perhaps even worship him for saving her life, against her wishes and against the timeline. Her death is what's needed to snap him back to the reality of his situation: he is alone, and like it or not he must still follow the rules. Even before then, Ten is often regretful of the sacrifices he must make to maintain the timeline, one of the best examples being The Fires of Pompeii.

Another big part of Ten is his tendency to run from problems instead of facing them head on. For example, in Human Nature/The Family of Blood, he would rather turn himself human for 3 months than take the Family of Blood head-on. Granted, it was because he was trying to be merciful, but ""if the Doctor hadn't come here... would anyone have died?"" He can act quite irresponsibly, but it is his companion's job to call him out on this. Speaking more broadly, his verbal tics, ""brainy specs"", quirks and general goofiness all hide a much darker personality (the Time Lord Victorious mentioned above). There's an example of this right in his first episode, The Christmas Invasion. Right after sparing the Sycorax Leader's life, he's joking with his friends and tossing a scavenged satsuma from hand to hand, but as soon as he senses the Sycorax Leader's charge, all traces of a smile are gone from his face. ""No second chances. I'm that sort of a man."" 
(Incidentally that was the scene that sold me on Ten; that was my first ever episode and I fell in love with DW the moment Jackie squeaked ""I'm gonna get killed by a Christmas tree!"")
That aspect of his personality is shown again right near the end of that episode. He brings down Harriet Jones and Britain's Golden Age, in a vengeful act of defiance after she disobeys him and has Torchwood shoot down the Sycorax spacecraft. We can also see Ten's darker side in Midnight (arguing with the passengers), New Earth (facing the cat-nun's laboratory), the poolside confrontation in School Reunion... Ten's usual carefree demeanor is his attempt to run away from the darker aspects of himself.

Last(ish) point: Ten is incredibly principled, sometimes to the point of stupidity. He sticks by his own rules at all times (apart from the aforementioned Time Lord Victorious moment) even if it will let the enemy get an upper hand. In The Sontaran Stratagem/The Poison Sky, he is willing to sacrifice his lives for the sake of giving the Sontarans a chance, despite having been set up as mass-murdering potatoheads with a big ego and a *serious* Napoleon complex. He will do everything he can to get you to accept his first warning and leave peacefully; after that, the kid gloves are off and he will do everything possible to stop you. In The Girl in the Fireplace he was willing to stick himself on the slow path for two thousand years to save Reinette, although how much of that was trying to protect a woman he (probably IMO) fell in love with is debatable. He will never pick up a gun, never imprison aliens (see: Torchwood) never kill someone personally and always go for the peaceful resolution. Sometimes these don't always work but he always tries.

Ten is Nine with the survivor guilt mellowed out; his human companions knock off some of the sharper Time Lord edges and humanizes him just as he Time-Lords them, in a way. What Ten never really came to grips with was his intense dependence on other people and the truckload of issues he carried, which seems to be happening with Eleven too (the perception filters as a metaphor for unexamined problems?). Eleven has learned to be more distant, maybe so as not to get himself hurt too much; he's also much more alien and more admiring of the ""little people"". As Ten neared his death, he became increasingly desperate and his first instinct when scared is to *run*, and run fast. In that way The End of Time is pretty tragic. He can run all he wants, he can outrun the Time War and the Master, but in the end it's Wilf's four gentle knocks that gives him one helluva slap from reality. He gets close to another Time Lord Victorious moment (""I could have done so much more! It's not *fair*!"" Yes, whiny and immature but he has every right to be, he's facing his death) but he's learned his lesson from Adelaide: humility.

TL;DR and I don't blame you :P - Loneliness, resentment of his duty, hiding his darker self under the goofiness, principled to the point of stupidity, and someone who'd rather run than face his issues. He only faces them when he's forced to. He REALLY needs someone to stop him.",0,1300885271,null,0,true,0,c1lxyvd,t3_g9apc,t1_c1lxyvd,t3_g9apc,1427006431,17,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,17

* Prejudice (• Prejudice bias: a partiality that prevents objective consideration of an issue or situation), perhaps not directly but he's already said that he's trying to combat misanthropy which he completely exagerates to be Cox and Sagan's view of the universe. Not just that while the human race is significant relative to the people of earth, in relation to the universe it's a toss in a gym sock.

* Luddism: (Luddite: •any opponent of technological progress). He's portraying one of the greatest teachers of science in the 20th centuary and an upcoming star who will likely be considered an equal by the time the 21st is over, as people who think humanity is a debasement of the universe. Surely as the only known source of life in the universe Sagan and Cox can find it in their black hearts to appreciate the earth. Oh wait they have and have done frequently.

* Illiberal (liberal •broad: showing or characterized by broad-mindedness; ""a broad political stance""; ""generous and broad sympathies""; ""a liberal newspaper""; ""tolerant of his opponent's opinions"") this one is ironic in itself coming from some body who is waging a ""culture war"". So much so I shan't even bother to bring the actual article in this.

* Irrationalism (rational •consistent with or based on or using reason; ""rational behavior""; ""a process of rational inference""; ""rational thought""). One of the base premises of logic and thus rationalism is that Correlation does not equal causation. Just because two scientists talk about things of a grander scale than the people on a rock spinning around a 1 in a billion trillion trillion (more trillions?) stars. Does not mean they do not value ever single atom, electron, proton and quark. They're physicists for fuck sake, good ones at that. It's their job to understand and appreciate the extremities of magnitude BOTH large, small and all the shades of grey inbetween.

Do this enough and you're stood in a cave with tunnel vision. What you want to do is lower your horizons thus seeing more, bringing us to the correct usage of the term ""expanding your horizons"".

true,2009dc,null,null,"Article 39 of the UN Charter:
The Security Council shall determine the existence of any threat to the peace, breach of the peace, or act of aggression and shall make recommendations, or decide what measures shall be taken in accordance with Articles 4 and 42, to maintain or restore international peace and security.

The language of this article refers to the powers of the UNSC to declare a war aggressive, and therefore to take sanctions as it sees fit. This is not last word as to whether a war is illegal, however.

The Nuremberg Trials, which predate the UN Charter, had already established a precedent in international humanitarian law for what constitutes an aggressive war, and therefore a war crime. Built on Nuremberg, and even earlier precedents, customary international law also contributes to governing what constitutes a war crime. In addition, the Geneva Conventions of 1949 govern war.

The language of Article 39 does not include the question of legality in large part because the major powers could not agree on the establishment of an international criminal court. The ICC was eventually established in 1998 to decide on the legality of a war, or any specific actions taken within a war. (It is worth noting that the United States is one of the very few countries not to have signed up to the ICC.)

There are legitimate questions to be asked about whether the US, France, the UK and the other countries waging war on Libya have already committed a war crime. For a start, they are bombing non-military targets such as Gaddafi's private compound. Of course, arguments could, and have been, made to categorize such a target as legitimate, and sanctioned by resolution UNSC 1973. But the ""jury"" is out on that one. The most senior British general in charge of the war on Libya flatly rejected that an attempt to assassinate Gaddafi was legal. Remember, ""regime change"" is not a legitimate war aim - one of the key questions in the run-up to the 2003 invasion of Iraq.

Some comments in the discussion above indicate that the war against Libya has more international support than the war against Iraq in 2003. It has a UNSC mandate (though, as I mentioned, there is debate as to exactly what UNSC 1973 actually permits) but it is worth bearing in mind that some UNSC members did not support it - permanent members Russia and China abstained. Though, this does not necessarily make a difference to the legality or overall character of the war, the question of international support is significant. NATO members Germany and Turkey oppose the war; Russia, China and India oppose the war; the African Union opposes the war; Italy reputedly opposed the war at first, but Berlusconi allegedly changed his mind due to pressure from the US and his coalition allies in the Northern League party; the Arab League supported a ""no-fly"" zone, but has since been very critical of the methods of the bombing campaign; there are indications that the masses in the Arab world oppose the war; in the UK, the majority of the population, according to one opinion poll, oppose the war.

In my opinion, the war is aggression sanctioned by the UNSC - I leave it for the lawyers (or maybe the historians) to sort out the question of legality. The powers now attacking Libya and denouncing Gaddafi have been selling him arms and crowd control equipment, doing business for oil and construction contracts with his regime, and generally cosy-ing up to this despot for the past decade. They must have know that he brooked no dissent and that his prisons were the scene of tortures. I don't think that Washington, London and Paris have suddenly discovered their humanitarianism and concern for the Libyan people. To me, it is far more likely that the Western powers would have liked to see Gaddafi quickly crush the protests so they could get on with business. Only when he proved incapable of doing so and the country - which supplies much of Europe's oil - entered into a civil war did France and Britain, followed by the US, decide that they needed to step in. They need to fashion a new regime capable of doing business with them and getting the oil flowing. They may also wish to establish a military presence in Libya to secure their interests across North Africa. 

The US and Britain have used different tactics than they did in 2003 - they were able to ally with France and get a UNSC resolution this time - but I do not think that their motives are any different, and certainly not more ""pure,"" than in the invasion Iraq in 2003.

Therefore, if France had voted against the resolution, as Chirac threatened to do in the run-up to Iraq in 2003, then the resolution would not have passed. However, far from being opposed to the attack on Libya, France was the most gung-ho about it. Paris unilaterally recognized the leadership in Benghazi as the government of Libya and stated that it would support this self-proclaimed group, largely made up of ex-Gaddafi loyalists, with material and political support - in effect a unilateral declaration of war against the de jure government of Libya. Finally, it was France that played the leading role in pushing the issue through the UNSC in an effort to win some diplomatic legitimacy for a conflict it was preparing anyway.

The Cameron government was pretty close to the position of France at this time, while it was the US that was reluctant to move openly against the regime in Tripoli. It seems to me that Washington's hand was forced by the French and British rush to war. Also, the Gaddafi regime became too compromised to survive, meaning that all the lucrative contracts it had signed with Western businesses were threatened, so a new regime had to fashioned by the major powers and no-one wanted to miss a trick. 

The main forces behind the war, the US, France and Britain, all want to defend and advance their influence in an economically and strategically vital country and region. The fact that they have a military coalition does not mean that they aren't rivals, each fighting for his share of the spoils. Also, NATO is badly split on the issue (Germany and Turkey oppose the war).

&gt;Mick Gradwell, a former detective superintendent, said the targeting of underage and vulnerable girls had been going on for decades.

&gt;He added: ‘You have girls being abused and raped and yet the most senior officers are refusing to comment on it. On what other subject would you get that?

true,Peskie,essex,Essex,"I agree with the CABs opinion about the Police. They would not be interested in illegal immigrant status as it's something for immigration rather than a police matter. UG is most likely accurate in that these guys are pretending to be police, which is an offence, or if they actually are it sounds as if they are working outside their legal remit unless a crime has been committed  (which would be a disciplinary offence).

If she has no papers or passport then its a good likelihood that immigration would have difficulty in deporting her as they'd need time to ascertain who she is and where she's from to deport her to, in the meantime she most likely will have leave to stay in the UK.

I think she has two option which are already mentioned by other redditors.

1. Face the music and go to the police to make a statement. In which case she needs to keep a diary and record of all messages between her and her former landlord as evidence. Also anything to date by yourself and co-redditor if willing to make witness statements and state that he has done this to other girls previously (sounds like he's set-up a honey trap).

2. If the police and possible deportation are not an option then she needs to disappear totally. This would mean loosing contact with friends and moving away to another part of the country ... far enough that him or his friends would not visit that area.

Personally I would pick option 1 where she'd have to face the music herself regarding her illegal status, is there a possibility that she can claim asylum of some kind? 

With option 2 she will be forever looking over her shoulder and may not forgive herself the possibility of him doing this to other vulnerable women.

This man sounds like a stalker and is worried that she will go to the police and expose his activities. He really does need to be stopped and I wouldn't be surprised if, from what you have said, that he has already raped and dumped at least one if not more than one woman in her situation. She's extremely luck to have friends like yourself and the other redditor.

One more thing regarding her immigration status, I'm sure there are law societies or charities where she can go for free legal advice regarding what's happened so far and how to clear up/become legal.",0,1300991514,null,0,true,0,c1m5ei1,t3_gahiu,t1_c1m5ei1,t1_c1m4q2r,1427010280,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

**10 Things You Probably Didn’t Know About Doctor Who**

Charlie Jane Anders — 10 Things You Probably Didn't Know About Doctor WhoYou think you know Doctor Who? Just like his sprawling time machine, the Doctor's mythology and mystery are too expansive and weird to be contained in a finite space. Here are 10 things you might not know about Doctor Who.

**10)** The Doctor almost met God.
John Wiles, who took over as producer of the show after original producer Verity Lambert left in 1965, wanted to push the show in a more experimental direction. And one of his ideas was a story called ""The Face of God."" According to Wiles, ""the TARDIS is stopped in mid-air by this enormous face which claims to be that of God himself. Of course towards the end it would be proven that all was not as it seemed."" Wiles was surprised to see his idea appear, nearly a quarter of a century later, in the movie Star Trek V: The Final Frontier. (You can just picture William Hartnell asking, ""What does God need with a time machine?"")

**9)** At least three different races have secretly guided the human race and helped us develop our current technology. The Daemon, Azal, reveals that the Daemons have helped humanity to advance to its present state of sophistication, and now we're to be tested (in ""The Daemons."") The Fendahl also turns out to have guided the whole of human history to the moment where it could be released (in ""Image of the Fendahl."") And Scaroth, last of the Jagaroth, uses his various time-splintered selves to help the human race advance more quickly throughout history, so he can build a time machine in the 20th century. (""City of Death."") Plus there's some implication the Osirians (from ""Pyramids of Mars"") did some guiding of humanity here and there. You have to wonder if they weren't falling over each other at some point.

**8)** Several actors played one-off roles on the show before becoming regulars. Peter Purves played American tourist Morton Dill (with a ridiculous accent) before joining the show as new companion Steven. Nicholas Courtney played Space Security Service Agent Bret Vyon in ""The Daleks Master Plan"" and then later played the Brigadier. John Levene was a Cyberman in ""The Moonbase"" and a Yeti in ""The Web of Fear"" and then became the recurring UNIT character Sgt. Benton. Ian Marter played the boxing-obsessed Lt. Andrews in ""The Carnival of Monsters"" and then played Harry Sullivan for a year or so. Lalla Ward was the awesomely named Princess Astra in ""The Armageddon Factor"" before becoming Romana. Colin Baker was a thuggish Time Lord, Maxil, in ""Arc of Infinity,"" and then became the Doctor himself. Freema Agyeman was Adeola, a Cyber-victim, in ""Army of Ghosts,"" and then played Martha Jones. And Karen Gillan was the Soothsayer in ""Fires of Pompeii"" before playing Amy Pond.

**7)** The Fourth Doctor, Tom Baker, tried to create a couple of Doctor Who movies. One of them was Doctor Who Meets Scratchman, a film in which the Doctor would have tangled with the Devil (aka Scratchman, as he's sometimes called in folklore) along with Daleks and robots called Cybors. There were also scarecrows made of bones, which came to life. And both Vincent Price and Twiggy would have co-starred. And then there was Doctor Who and the Krikkitmen, which Baker tried to develop with then-writer Douglas Adams — who wound up using many of the ideas in his third Hitchhiker's book, Life, The Universe and Everything.

**6)** Mick Jagger's estate, Stargroves, was used in two 1970s Doctor Who stories. These were ""Pyramids of Mars"" and ""Image of the Fendahl."" As far as we know, Jagger wasn't actually present during the filming of either story, and they only shot exterior location shots at Stargroves. Nor were any Jagaroth involved.

**5)** The Doctor was originally planned to be an anti-science reactionary. With a time machine. All of the original documents behind the creation of Doctor Who are online at the BBC, and they make for fascinating reading. Among other things, there's a memo outlining a very different type of show about a team of ""Troubleshooters"" who solve problems. Also, various ideas for how the Doctor's time machine could be disguised — like, it's a clear bubble, or we never even see it at all — are tossed out. But the craziest notion is that the Doctor is traveling through time and space to find a perfect, idyllic past, free of science and technology. ""He is an extension of the scientist who has opted out... One symptom of this is his hatred of scientists, inventors, improvers. ... He malignantly tries to stop progress (the future) wherever he finds it, while searching for his ideal (the past).""

**4)** Tom Baker wanted to have a talking cabbage as a companion. At least, so legend has it. The talking cabbage would have been an alien creature that sat on the Doctor's shoulder, and could have served as a replacement when Louise Jameson (Leela) left the series. Baker was also quite keen on the idea of the Doctor having a much older woman as a companion.

**3)** One of Peter Davison's first companions could have been a former Tom Baker companion. As Tom Baker neared the end of his run of playing the Doctor, the new producer, John Nathan-Turner, wanted to bring back a former companion to help bridge the gap between the Fourth and Fifth Doctors. He approached Elisabeth Sladen, who didn't want to return to the show, but agreed to star in a spin-off instead. But he also was in talks with Louise Jameson, who'd played Leela, for quite a while. Jameson was keen to come back for two or three stories, but Nathan-Turner wanted her to commit to a whole season, and she said no. So instead, the new character of Tegan Jovanka was created.

**2)** The Daleks almost didn't appear in the new series at all. The original co-creator of the Daleks, Terry Nation, owned the copyright of the show's most famous monsters. At various points during the show's history, the Daleks had been off limits (notably 1968-1971) and Nation's Estate was leery of letting the revamped show use them. While Rob Shearman was working on his script, ""Dalek,"" negotiations broke down altogether — the show couldn't include the Daleks at all. Shearman explained to Den of Geek:

 &gt; I'm afraid I panicked a bit for a week or two. I came up with other ideas for new episodes altogether, but I was trying too hard - and eventually Russell sat me down, gave me a new monster to plug the gap, and sent me back to work. The identity of that monster, the fact it wasn't an iconic Dalek, changed the entire script from top to bottom - it made it much funnier, actually, which I rather liked. What he gave me was a silver ball, and told me that within it he'd later reveal an entire human head from the end of time - they had come out of nowhere, these mysterious creatures, killed the Time Lords, killed the Daleks....

 &gt; Russell told me that he had in mind that those silver balls were part of a season three idea he'd now brought forward - and, sure enough, at the end of season three there they were, now called the Toclafane. He's a clever chap, Russell.

Of course, in the end, the Terry Nation estate relented and the Daleks were able to appear after all. But it's fascinating to imagine how things could have played out differently if the Toclafane had been the villains of season one.

**1)** The Doctor could have had an evil son. The show's original star, William Hartnell, was keen on doing a storyline called ""The Son of Doctor Who."" No, this wouldn't have been an earlier version of ""The Doctor's Daughter."" As Hartnell explained:

 &gt; At one time (in late 1964) I thought we might extend the series and I suggested giving the Doctor a son and calling the programme The Son of Doctor Who. The idea was for me to have a wicked son. We would both look alike, each have a TARDIS and travel in outer space. In actual fact, it would have meant that I had to play a dual role when I `met' my son.

Would this son have been the father of the Doctor's granddaughter Susan? The BBC shot down the idea, so we'll never know.

true,PSBlake,null,null,"**Books**

The BBC Books series of Eighth Doctor Adventures had 73 entries from 1997 to 2005. Most of them are pretty good, a few are incredible, and a tiny fragment are painfully awful. I personally recommend:

* Alien Bodies
* Vanderdeken's Children
* The Scarlet Empress
* Demontage
* Unnatural History
* Interference, books 1 &amp; 2 (but make sure you've seen the 3rd Doctor story *Planet of the Spiders* first, just so Pertwee's regeneration is fresh in your mind)
* The Blue Angel
* The Space Age
* The Ancestor Cell
* The Turing Test
* Father Time
* Eater of Wasps
* Anachrophobia
* Crooked World
* The Tomorrow Windows
* The Gallifrey Chronicles

Bear in mind, though, there's strong continuity between books, so if you just jump into one out of sequence, a lot of things will seem meaningless to you. Also, the last Virgin New Adventures novel featuring the Doctor was *The Dying Days,* - this was, in fact, the first Eighth Doctor novel, but was published in the Virgin New Adventures series. Its placement is uncertain, although it definitely takes place after the movie and probably before *Vampire Science* (The second BBC EDA).

**Comics**

The full run of Eighth Doctor comics from Doctor Who Magazine have been collated in graphic novel form by Panini books, and they're all great. The volumes are:

* Endgame
* The Glorious Dead
* Oblivion
* The Flood (This continued on a story set up in the 7th Doctor comics, but that hasn't yet been reprinted in graphic novel form - there is a brief summary of the events leading up to it in the first few pages of *The Flood* graphic novel, though)

**Audio Books/Dramas**

Big Finish has featured the Eighth Doctor in two of their product lines: Intermittently in their monthly Doctor Who series, and centrally in their New Eighth Doctor Adventures series for BBC7. *Almost all of these are, at a minimum, enjoyable.* There aren't many cringe-worthy bad ones among them, although *Minuet in Hell* comes close, and your enjoyment of *Zagreus* is probably directly proportional to your enjoyment of metafictional humor and ""wibbly-wobbly-timey-wimey"" type plots.

In general, the BBC7 New Eighth Doctor Adventures (Sometimes referred to as ""The Doctor and Lucie Miller"" adventures) follow the structure of a seasonal TV-series, with mytharcs, strong continuity, and tighter pacing, whereas the monthly series is more episodic.

*Monthly series recommendations*

* Storm Warning
* Invaders from Mars
* The Chimes of Midnight
* Scaredy Cat
* Other Lives
* Time Works
* Memory Lane
* The Girl Who Never Was
* The Company of Friends (Especially if you've read the books and comics)

Special Note: There is a mytharc initially set up in *Storm Warning*, hinted at in *Chimes of Midnight*, which then runs straight from *Neverland* to *The Next Life* - 10 stories in total. Some of them are great (*Scherzo*), while some are just strange. Overall, it's worth listening to, but listening out of sequence is likely to confuse.
