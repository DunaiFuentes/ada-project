Exactly. They've released just enough information to ""suggest"" a lot, all of which is in their favour. Note that the original claims were basically 'there was a shootout'. Now it's 'he had a gun' and 'officer may have been shot by police'. By Thursday we'll probably been told it was a replica and it was an 'accidental discharge'. 

This is the standard mechanism in the UK for handling bad news. Drip-feed it slowly and hope most people only hear the initial claims. I could cite dozens of examples of this. 

&gt; If he had raised it at an officer, or even reached for it, it would have been reasonable for the officers to open fire to subdue him.

Yes, but there are reports that he did not do that. There have been no reports from the police that he pointed it at them. If he had then they would have said this already. 

&gt; all the evidence is pointing in one direction...

Indeed, they are very very good at doing that. If only 20% of people ever hear the 'corrections' then they have succeeded in their information management role.

I know most people won't read what i write, most the time it spans over an entire page!!!  Sometimes i put talking points in the first three lines so people know to downvote, it's a cheap trick but it bumps it to the top of 'controversial' where the person i care about hangs out; the person i love i should say, it's more than just caring - the person i devote my entire life to really, that mythical being which will rise from the fires of chaos and weild the sword i've devoted my life to sharpening....  
  
Ah i ramble, really if i'm going to get religious about this is should do it in the religion i made for this sort of thing....... I just wanted to say that i probably love you, it's weird to hear but possibly true.  The world is a complex place, some of us are tortured with complex minds - it's a sea of forces, a storm of ideas and ideals; existence is futile...  but, but, in the muddy mass of slowly forming conceptualisations comes this beautiful figure riding a the horse of history, carrying the shield of morality and wielding the bastard sword of +9 eloquence.  
  
The snarling fools writhing in the filth and biting at each others backs, the carrion feeders circling above, the mould eating the trees and the bacteria poisoning the water of the metaphysical world - they stop, they look, they see the glory and the light, they see the sense and the reason....  This figure high upon mighty steed speaks out aloud 'I am the new hope, I am the flood upon the dry soil and the fire in the morning sky!  Come and wash yourself in my radiance, come feed yourself in my aura, come pleasure yourself in my loins!  
  
And the people said, 'but your light blinds us, where are you that we may feed of you?!?' and lo, the figures voice did spake thus 'look down, look towards yourself - for you are me, we are all people, my name is Us.' and tears of joy were wept and the soil was fertile and great harvest did come of which all supped.

* a constant feed of media bullshit (film, tv, sports, videogames) that dulls the mind and encourages vacuous pursuits;
* increasing benefits to placate the masses, even that fucking Osborne gets child benefit (accept the arguably responsible minority that don't considering over-population);
* cushy pensions for the boomers, but quickly depreciating for generations there after;
* if the series *Friends* didn't make it obvious, many even require their social lives piped to them, which often happens almost daily (*Coronation Street*, etc);
* not to mention ready meals and fast food, the people cannot even feed themselves;
* democracy is reduced to phoning in for the latest idol;
* the police, parliament, and news organisations have to collude to create an ignorant, distracted population (re: *NoTW*);
* a constant supply of shiny gadgets;
* a constant supply of images of 'the third world', oh how lucky we are;
* and what makes it all happen, lots and lots of personal debt.

There are reports that there is even a media blackout. I don't watch TV so I can't verify that, but if true, that means the system is damned scared of the ill-feeling spreading. Does that not remind you of Egypt under Mubarak? That's what it takes to make it tolerable.

If people stopped and really looked at their lives they would realise they are surrounded by almost valueless artefacts: disposable furniture, electronics, plastic clothes, and even the bricks, mortar, plastic facades and fixtures.

On a macro level, the 'comfortable lives' of which you speak depend heavily on at least two illegal economic wars, and the support of *de facto* slave labour in places like China and India, as well as mass environmental damage. The UK is a net importer of food, so in 5-10 years when oil prices skyrocket, or there is yet another disruptive war, you'd wish you hadn't spent that money on a conservatory for that jacuzzi, or that indulgent decking, and instead invested in the knowledge of gardening or some other productive skill. You don't know how close to failure the system is. Remember the fuel protests? If it had continued two more days there would not have been food on shelves. Damn right you would have seen mass looting with in a week.

Because nigger never just meant 'black skinned person' no it meant a lot more and to the idiot right wing in america it often still does - the same as 'chav' doesn't just denote someone in kappa and burb'ry it denotes a scum.  
  
Only in reality and practice it's applied to anyone that's obviously lower class, to anyone with certain clothing tastes of vocal mannerisms, innit?  That pregnant lady?  Her outfit denotes she's a chav and thus scum.  That road worker?  His hat marks him out as thieving benefit fraud scum.....  See how it works?  
  
It's a way of stopping people progressing, exactly the same as the whole nigger thing was (is) - 'don't employ the nigger' is exactly the same as 'don't employ the chav' 
  
And yes i understand that black people are born black but burb'ry is a choice - well guess what, you don't have a right to define other peoples styles!  You simply don't, thinking you do is horribly nazi so think about that before you say anything.  Expecting people to conform to a system which has never shown them kindness, never shown them respect and never shown itself to be decent is a fucking big ask, i very much doubt you'd be willing to do it.
  
You might write this off as nonsense, you might say 'ah but it's different' and i'm sure is, just as the Zoot Suit Riots were different and the battle of the bean field was different and and fucking and.  
  
For those that don't know the Zoot Suit Riots was the name given to a sweeping round of violence in latino communities, many of the youth wore beautiful and awesome zoot suits, pride in themselves and all that sort of business was at an all time high in the communities but this annoyed a lot of bigots; a highly controversial incident sparked violence between US Marines on shore leave and anyone wearing a zootsuit or looking like they might wear one; huge chaos erupted after which the authorities blamed 'gang culture in the latino areas' and took steps to absolutely crush their subculture, going as far as a to ban zoot suits...  I expect the word 'uppity' was used.  
 
This is how 'the system' works, this is the method used to shit on people that aspire to anything beside absolute docile wage slavery - you are one of the jailers, if you go to the gate you'll find the next jailer has the keys to your cell - you'll probably never be sure who his jailer is but he's a total dick let me assure you...

So the 'public Consciousness' price for drink is what they will charge. So when they offer 2 for 1 drinks you think you are getting a good deal. But if a restaurant started offering you would see it as an impossibly cheap alternative because you are comparing it against the standard price you are holding in your head which may make you think the same about the quality in the rest of the store. I am totally oversimplifying all of this but that is what I can remember.

tl;dr people pay what they expect to pay.

No, because I don't solely judge on appearance, I called the rioters chav's  for many different factors.

- The shops they stole from
- the damage they caused
- the fights they started with the police and other people
- the hiding of their face (why do it if they didn't think it was wrong)
- posts like [these](http://imgur.com/KVvgW)

the generalisations you just made have nothing to do with the description i gave you. I know road workers, people with thick scouse accents, people who work in garages, people who rightfully claim benefits when they need it, none of these are chavs, if you check my description again you may notice...

you know exactly what type of person I'm referring too and its not secluded to lower class, they're are plenty of rich people who are famous as ""Celebrity personalities"", katy price or Kerry Katona as an example who'd I'd consider a chav.

&gt; *""you don't have a right to define other peoples styles! You simply don't, thinking you do is horribly nazi so think about that before you say anything.""*

nazi comparisons', why am I not surprised, again its not solely based on appearance, its about mentality and attitude under the description I provided.

&gt; ""Expecting people to conform to a system which has never shown them kindness, never shown them respect and never shown itself to be decent is a fucking big ask, i very much doubt you'd be willing to do it.""

the difference is, I'm not in london right now fighting police for the sake of looting a few free things.

you're ridiculous assumptions are just that, again, under my original description of a chav, they deserve no respect.

I sincerely hope you roll your eyes at this next sentence: much of what you say, I agree with - especially your pointing out at the end there that our actual means of sustenance are contingent on cheap oil, which is running out. Our current ""civilisation"", such as it is, is not sustainable. I've actually rarely met anyone who thinks that it is.

As for your harrowing critique of our lovely modern culture: I can share your cynicism, and your contempt for the trivialisation of politics and your concern about the supplanting of critical thought with self-identification-with-objects so on. I try not to go on about it though in case it appears conceited.

Because - here's the thing - most people *do not* share these views. *Perhaps* because they've been brainwashed (by a malevolent organised system, or by an aggregation of chaotic, trivial images - does it make any difference?) Perhaps because at some level they're aware that their material wealth, with which their self-image is so strongly identified, depends on not rocking the boat. Perhaps apathy is a complicated phenomenon...

(...perhaps it's because you and I, *mate*, are wrong. It's possible. If we stop acknowledging our fallibility, what does that make us?)

The broader point I was trying to make is that right now, an enormous, mostly urban, population is being kept alive, and pretty healthy. Nobody's pretending the country is perfect, but right now,  most people have enough food, fresh water, sanitation, shelter, healthcare, and when winter comes most of us will see the other end of it. 

I've already acknowledged it's unsustainable in the long term. But - with all it's many faults, which include institutional injustices and all-out wars - it's infrastructure is responsible for sustaining the lives of millions. 

If these lives can be sustained in better ways - and I believe they can - there has to be a gradual change. People's expectations have to change, their self-reliance has to be built up, we need (IMO) a huge population shift away from cities. Any change more sudden would basically mean breaking the systems that support us now, without having anything in their place. That would mean a lot of deaths. I do not believe the end justifies the means (or, indeed, that a sudden change would bring about anything remotely like a convivial, empowered society). 

Anything amounting to a sudden revolution is going to be disasterous. I think that extolling them as somehow preceding a righteous rebellion is naive in the extreme. Democracy (such as we have) is a mockery, but a minority attempting to overthrow the system which is acceded to and participated in by the majority, is conceited at best, evil at worst.

&gt;Do we execute people for crimes of passion

We would follow our current model in the justice system - the judge looks at the law, looks at the circumstance, looks at previous rulings (precedent), and comes to a conclusion. This is what happens now already - ""crimes of passion"", ""manslaughter"", etc get lower sentences and than ""murder"" and so this will continue.


&gt;how many do they need to kill before they're put on death row?

Murder, not kill. And the number is 1. With the above answer included - a victim killing a attacker is not murder.


&gt; If we take America as an example, the death penalty is actually more costly than life imprisonment.

Remember, the US subsidise prison by having their prisoners do work. We do not.


&gt;Again, using the US as example...never really knowing for sure if/when they're going to die.


I care not for the emotions of a murderer. If we did then why arrest them at all.


&gt;You assume that justice is blind and infallible. You can't apologise to an innocent dead man

If we did not trust the system then why lock anyone up? Under the system I propose - given the option of executing one man in error or keeping all the rapists, murderers, et al alive for the rest of their lives while we work to pay for them - I chose the prior. I think this because I look at the bigger picture. Also, by locking someone up for the rest of their life you have already taken their life - its just a slower process.


&gt;I want to live in a society that is better than the sum of it's parts... modern first-world civilisation.


punishing murdered without burdening society is not anarchy. My model follows the idea that if you want to live in our society and reap the rewards of civilisation then you have to pay if you decide to murder our people, rape our women, etc. I am a believer in [Thomas Hobbe's ""social contract"" and ""Leviathan state""](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leviathan_%28book%29).

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt; Exactly. They've released just enough information to ""suggest"" a lot, all of which is in their favour. Note that the original claims were basically 'there was a shootout'. Now it's 'he had a gun' and 'officer may have been shot by police'. By Thursday we'll probably been told it was a replica and it was an 'accidental discharge'.

Pull the other one. A non-police firearm was recovered from the scene, and you're coming out with this conspiracy theory information management bullshit? Bear in mind more information has been released by the IPCC than the Metropolitan Police Service at this point.

It was a (presumably intelligence-led) firearms operation. A firearm was recovered. I don't think you quite understand the gravity of that.

So he had a firearm in his possession but he was a completely innocent chap who had otherwise never broken the law in his life? No, he had a string of criminal convictions; the media are reporting he was a 'gangster', a drug dealer and a founding member of a local gang. This isn't the police attempting to character assassinate him, the allegations about his character speak for themselves.

&gt; This is the standard mechanism in the UK for handling bad news. Drip-feed it slowly and hope most people only hear the initial claims. I could cite dozens of examples of this.

You're completely wrong on that one. If you want to bury bad news and cover up a scandal, you dump it in one go. The last thing you want is the scandal being dragged out with a continuous stream of new developments. If there are no new developments, an incident is no longer front page material.

&gt; Yes, but there are reports that he did not do that. There have been no reports from the police that he pointed it at them. If he had then they would have said this already.

*Are* there reports that he didn't reach for or raise the gun at officers? How on earth would any eyewitnesses other than the officers involved be able to rule that out?

&gt; However, with all of the corrections pointing in another direction, watch this space. I guarantee in one week things will be very different.

What corrections are these? The revelation that the bullet recovered from the police radio was a hollow point, of the sort used by police? **The police never claimed they were shot at by Duggan.

Others blame imperialism, but while Europe was poor and cold, Africa was rich in game, minerals, timber, and fertile land. While the rest of the world was making advances in science and mathematics, blacks were happy to hunt when they were hungry, seek out water when they were thirsty and rape when they were horny, never planning beyond their immediate needs.

Gotcha, I can see how it was probably a figure of speech.

Given the context, I won't say that, no. That's not to say I value a murderer per se, but I won't go down the route of deciding whether or not one human life is more valuable than another, or weighing it against something like education.

If I say ""£2m is too much, kill that person"", but suddenly costs reduced? So it costs £1m too keep a prisoner for life. Or maybe £500k. What about £100k? £50k, £20k? £1? Where's the limit?

That argument is similar to as to who should get the death penalty. Some people have said child killers. So that would mean someone who killed a kid of 17 years 364 days would be put to death, while another person kills a man of 18 years 1 day and gets life in prison.

That's not even taking in to account factors such as the 17.9 year old was a criminal who had caused GBH on dozens of people, while the 18.1 year old man had a wife and 3 kids.

true,BraveSirRobin,null,null,"&gt; The police never claimed they were shot at by Duggan. Never.

It was heavily implied by them which was then reported as fact. If you don't believe me simply look at the news reports yourself. 

&gt; you're coming out with this conspiracy theory information management bullshit?

This is no theory, it's proven standard for the London police. It's precisely how Ian Tomlinsons death was covered. The story went through several iterations, [from outright lies through to the truth](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ian_Tomlinson#How_the_story_emerged) which only came out because there was video of the incident. 

Likewise, with Charles de Menezies, the initial story [was a complete lie](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_of_Jean_Charles_de_Menezes#Disputed_facts_and_events) and portrayed the police in a incorrect light. The truth only came out in this case because of the investigation and eyewitnesses. 

There was the shooting of Abul Kahar Kalam, again the initial 'unnamed sources' made wild claims that made the shooting sound just. Then they planned suggestions that he had paedophile material on his computer which the press reported as fact. None of this was true. All of this detracted from the fact that the police shot an unarmed man in his underwear. 

This is a well proven standard operating procedure. It's not just something I'm 'coming out with', [it's been observed by others more eloquent than I](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3MnLSjyBLA). Please watch this short clip, it explains this far better than I could.

If you wish I could cite some examples of UK politicians using the same technique for political policy announcements. It's a public relations standard. 

&gt; but he was a completely innocent chap who had otherwise never broken the law in his life?

Irrelevant. If it was an unjust shooting (as I'm confident it will prove to be) then people have a right to be angry. The MET are well known to be racist.

&gt; This isn't the police attempting to character assassinate him, the allegations about his character speak for themselves.

I never said or implied that. Suggesting that 'he deserved it' just isn't an option. The information management is being used to drip feed the bad parts of the story to us. I suspect they'll hold back a little until things calm down. 

&gt; You're completely wrong on that one. If you want to bury bad news and cover up a scandal, you dump it in one go. 

Then please cite some examples of scandals bigger than the shootings I referenced that were handled in that way. 

The worst info is always held back until the initial outrage has subsided. It gets less coverage that way. 

&gt; Are there reports that he didn't reach for or raise the gun at officers? How on earth would any eyewitnesses other than the officers involved be able to rule that out?

This reddit is at the moment a great community, but with a little promotion from everyone in r/soccer when you see those Chelsea badges we can grow bigger and have even better debate regarding The Mighty Blues and someday overtake our once more prestigious [neighbours](http://www.reddit.com/r/gunners)

If you are lucky enough to be catching a game live join us on the [r/soccer chat room](http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=#reddit-soccer) and get behind the blues. Let us know if you have any ideas for the reddit and also if you think any thing could be done better.

I hope to grow into this role like [Lukaku](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UmHAafdbRkE) into [Drogbas](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oa8TQRYYUpw) boots, or [Zhirkov](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIAcLUpbI7E) in a gulag, it's funny how so many [ex-Chelsea](http://rt.com/sport/football/scolari-quits-uzbek-bunyodkor/) staff find themselves in remote parts of Russia, apparently [Butch](http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2010/nov/11/ray-wilkins-chelsea-carlo-ancelotti) is doing hard Siberian as we speak (I'd better not disagree with [S_G](http://www.reddit.com/user/ScreamingGerman) too much or I may suffer the same fate).

So I for one am looking forward to watching the exploits of the [new regime](http://www.level3football.com/royhendo/article/andre_villas_boas_how_would_he_fare_at_chelsea) (again), all our [players](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chelsea_F.C.#Current_squad) (just [one more](http://images.football.co.uk/Dynamic/News/400x400/LukaModricNew2.jpg) please [Roman](http://www.guardian.co.uk/artanddesign/2011/jun/04/roman-abramovich-upsets-venetians-view)) and welcoming back an [old friend](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVGi-j2g5CE).

I love Dr. Who for how it deals with time.  It follows my own choice theory on the mechanics of time travel, specifically that everything that has happened, is happening, or will happen has already been determined, and that consciousness is just the linear progression through parts of this universe's (hi)story.

What this means is that the Doctor cannot alter memories: he cannot re-enter someone's timeline before he met them so as to alter their past.  (Screw A Christmas Carol.  That special betrays DWs ideas on time.)

This means that if he's experiencing something bad that he wants to change, he can go to the past or to the future or somewhen else to change that bad thing AFTER the point in time which he left it.  So if there's a war, and 130,000 people are dead, he can only alter the time stream to prevent more from being killed, because the 130,000 that have died ALWAYS had died.

It's a deterministic view on time that argues against free will, but it solves all paradoxes, and maintains the conservation of energy, mass, and information across the universe's timeline as a whole.*

*I just realized it doesn't but I haven't yet thought out how to avoid that possibility:  A test if you understood this: figure out how this does not maintain those laws of conservation!

Companies not paying tax is a huge problem, but nobody wants to deal with it more than the government, because they want the money so they can spend it on poor people and win an election. That's a simple case of a modern democracy having a pretty weak government actually, there's not alot they can do to bring corporations to justice that doesn't end up costing more than coming to some arrangement with said corporation.

These are problems best solved over time with legislation being made more and more enforced/enforcable.

Also, ""kids of this generation"" have it the fuck easy. All the things you mentioned have happened for generations on a much higher scale.

Economic downturn for example. Even as late as the 80's, there wasn't money in the economy to pay the relatively large benefits paid to unemployed people these days. Very few people have died of malnutrition or starvation as has happend in every major economic downturn until the 1990's.

Corporations have alot of power in terms of tax avoidance, but they are taxed a far higher rate far more successfully ever before.

Life is shit at the moment, I'll make no mistake about it, my family has been as low as it gets. Therefore, I am keenly aware that this is not as low as it would have been in history. So whilst the nation is shit, we have to keep a hold on context for all the bad things that have happened. None of it warrants the level of disorder going on right now.

We need news media to stop dramatising everything, then people would realise that the shit going on, whilst shit, it is not quite the apocalyptic meltdown we are told it is. Current conditions do not justify the current orgy of violence sweeping our cities.

For example, the building above the Carpet Right store burned down in Tottenham: it had 26 families living in it. That's **26 families without a home**. That wasn't bankers who did that this time, it was people who are apparently angry about the unfair circumstances. I'm afraid a reaction to unjust circumstances that leads to you inflict unfair circumstances on others . . . you are alot less deserving of sympathy, even if I still understand *why* you'd feel that way.",0,1312842804,null,0,false,0,c2b29fg,t3_jciyf,t1_c2b29fg,t1_c2b24k6,1427447369,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

true,newborn_mutant,uk,Loughborough/Bristol,"yes, even a small amount is corruption. But the cost of (less than) 3 MP's annual salaries is not alot of corruption for 600+ MPs.

We should be unhappy, and it's right that MPs got sent to prison and forced to pay it back, but we need to make sure our response is within context because frankly, even though a small amount of corruption is still corruption, it's still also a small amount!

I was not confused, it seemed like you were implying that the causes you listed did justify the riots. If the causes did not justify the riots, clearly you wouldn't have said ""well you wonder why this happened?! or something to that extent. Because that implies that the causes listed were justification enough, hence ""of course this happened for those reasons!"".

However, if you now claim that those causes *don't* justify what's happening, then the root causes of what's happening clearly *cannot* be what you listed, since clearly that motivation alone you have asserted doesn't justify what is happening.

That may be part of the reason, but the fact of the matter is a large number of people have chosen to engage in a series of criminal activities, *that* is the primary reason for their engaging in criminal activities; I believe their choice in the matter in this case, is more of a cause than any social factors.",0,1312845110,null,0,false,0,c2b2jmn,t3_jciyf,t1_c2b2jmn,t1_c2b2eqp,1427447510,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

We should punish the MPs for any crimes they have committed, but also be aware that compared to other places, for example the European Parliament, [where some MEPs have doubled their salaries using the expenses system they have](http://www.accountancyage.com/aa/news/1784718/report-uncovers-mep-expenses-abuse), it was only a little bit of corruption.

I'm not saying it shouldn't be taken seriously, individuals involved who have broken the law should be taken to court, and have justice served to them.

My point was that *only a little bit of corruption* as you paraphrased it, ought ot be treated as only a little bit of corruption. That way, it won't just seem same old, same old when larger corruption occurs.
For example, I think it's far worse that Murdoch managed to persuade and bully every Prime Minister since 1980 to at some point do what he wanted. That's worse than 600+ MPs skimming off 3 MPs salaries' worth of money a year.

We should react to all corruption, but we should react proportionally, for fear that eventually our voices will fall on deaf ears, because it will be too easy to justify ignoring us, since last time we got angry over nothing.
Also, nobody seems to give that much of a shit that people in positions of responsibility in the MoD organised contracts worth billions, then went and worked for the companies they gave contracts to. That got less coverage than MPs expenses. That ought to have gotten a larger reaction that it did really; but that's another story for another day.

Really, I've just re-read what we both put in previous comments, we've probably both come across as far less reasonable than I suspect we both are, so thanks for the debate, I like talking with people who have different opinions, otheriwse life is boring; I'm afraid I am out of this now, before I give myself an aneurysm.",0,1312847716,null,0,true,0,c2b2v91,t3_jciyf,t1_c2b2v91,t1_c2b2p25,1427447625,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

**EDIT:** Came across another mention of him. Not much extra detail, and a rather expected outcome in some ways:

&gt; Shortly afterwards he was chased by rioters and forced to flee, but returned to report live to camera on the aftermath of the Clapham Junction disturbance after Sky News dispatched a satellite truck, entering a looted Boots store and fetching an empty packet of Imodium from the litter-strewn floor.

It would escalate into some degree of violence due to multiple motives (right now, everyone is looting so it's ""okay"" to loot. What if everyone's confronting or even attacking one another? A new kind of hoodlum may appear, or even gang fights).

It would be worth mentioning that the actual action - setting things on fire, looting, damaging cars - is done sporadically and spontaneously. If you see groups of people milling about they might not even be doing anything wrong, and if looting is happening and they see a vigilante gang approaching trust me they will GTFO quicker than you can chase them, disperse, and mill about with the uninvolved people. You might catch one or two people but even with a thousand vigilantes, one supposes, you will ultimately fight a losing battle.

Then there's the legal repercussions. They are hard to identify thanks to clothing/accessories, you probably will be less so. Do not suppose that because you are on the side of the citizen, any unpleasant (even unintentional) events that transpire will not put you at equal risk in the eyes of the law. Trust me, you won't have the blessing of the police.

I'm not saying it's an invalid course of action, it just might not be the most moral, sensible, or effective one.

true,DiogenesTheSincere,scottish,Scotland,"I'm not missing that point. But violence begets violence. Perhaps they will fold, perhaps not. Perhaps results will differ depending on the area and amount of rioters. I would like to mention the following:

* tying up caught looters and then ""leaving"" them for police to come along and pick them up is ridiculous. Other rioters will come find them almost immediately and set them free, or worse, less law-abiding groups or individuals seeking revenge will find criminals at their mercy - instead of at that of the country's justice system.

* other confrontation such as violence (as opposed to the above form of ""citizen's arrest"") will, as I've said, beget violence. Some rioters will run away. Others will throw stones, bottles, and possibly even co-ordinate attacks with fellow rioters. It will also more than likely be morally questionable (yes, even with these rioters) on the part of the ""defence"" group, and even more questionable in a legal context, which will lead to later ramifications.

* it's being said a lot that the opportunists are having a field day because police can't make many arrests: cells are full, the system is busy, all kinds of reasons. So even if you make an arrest easy for the system, there's little to no guarantee that the system can/will take advantage of it.

true,[deleted],null,null,"Also, the character of Professor Chronotis in ""Dirk Gentley's Holistic Detective agency"" was originally supposed to be a character in the Fourth Doctor episode ""Shada"", which never got finished due to a BBC strike.  Dirk Gentley's Holistic detective agency also has quite a few story similarities to Shada, albeit with a much more...Adams-y way of going about it.

In Shada, Chronotis is a friend of the Doc's, a time lord pretending to be a cambridge professor, with his TARDIS disguised as his college rooms.  He's so old and has time-traveled so much he's extremely forgetful and absent-minded, and he kinda has a fondness for silly jokes.

In Dirk gently, he's pretty much the same, except there's no mention of Time Lords or TARDISes in it, and his absent-mindedness is multiplied by the fact that, when he says he's going to the kitchen to get a cup of tea, he's usually actually writing down what he was talking about, traveling through time for a few weeks, and then reappearing a few seconds after he left so no-one notices. 

It's possible they're actually the same character, considering the Dirk Gentley Chronotis claims he's so old he can't actually remember who he is or where he came from, and a professor's college rooms wouldn't be a bad disguise for a TARDIS chameleon circuit to put on...",0,1312851187,null,0,true,0,c2b39sn,t3_jbiye,t1_c2b39sn,t1_c2awjd7,1427447815,1,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,1

The hood was shot by a special police organisation, Operation Trident, that focuses on gun crime connected with drug dealing, and an illegal firearm was retrieved.

A man had been shot however so it immediately went to the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) for review.  The IPCC are not actually police more the people who have police powers to investigate the police.  Ironically they actually have a good record for bringing people to account - even the previous chief commissioner, Ian Blair

People were protesting outside the police station demanding to know what had happened but the IPCC were already talking with his family.  The police couldn't say anything because now it's an ongoing inquiry and the family is already being spoken to.  Then the 'peaceful' demonstration, no doubt attended in part by his gang members, turned violent.  Violence built on violence and then people, even rival gangs, decided to go looting.

true,Skilbride,null,null,"&gt;Thirty years on from the riots, one walks up Prince's Avenue, past what was the incinerated Rialto and the sign into Toxteth, and yet another sign promising imminent arrival into the ""Regeneration Zone"", and showing pictures of a perfect cereal-packet multiracial family, pristine modern houses and beautifully refurbished original stock – beneath which is the inevitable crass slogan that accompanies every corporate or political effort these days, always beginning with a pretentious gerund, in this case: ""Creating neighbourhoods for the future"". When you turn left into that future, and along Granby Street, once the spinal cord of Toxteth, you walk into what feels like a tomb.

The eerie streets are all but deserted, Victorian terraced houses of good solid stock condemned, abandoned and empty for 18 years now, their windows either bricked up or covered in steel sheeting, as though to obliterate any family or human life – any memory of Christmas, love, argument or sex the household may once have held. Each violent metal sheet bears the logo of Liverpool City Council on a sticker, sometimes accompanied by that of a partner such as ""IPS security for the community"", with all the grotesque irony of that particular slogan. Along other funereal, destitute streets – people's former homes arranged like mausoleums in a cemetery – activists against Liverpool's city-wide demolition psychosis have painted bright curtains on the concrete or steel, and flowers in pots sitting on imaginary window sills, an attempt to simultaneously mock the authorities, and compensate for their vandalism. Doubling back further up Granby Street, one reaches some of the appalling ""regenerative"" modern housing that has replaced the terraced streets already fallen to Liverpool's random wrecking ball: some of them – ersatz Lego bricks of the cheapest materials – are already dilapidated, while others almost new are managing to last a few years, like Michael Simon's mother's new house on Cawdor Street. Michael explains: ""Mum was told to leave Beaconsfield Street while they repaired the house. They put her into temporary accommodation in Kingsley Road and while she was there, they told her that her home was beyond repair, and would have to be demolished. Then, just as she was settling in, they told her that the temporary house was due for demolition too, so she would have to move to a new house.""",0,1312854895,null,0,false,0,c2b3pan,t3_jd13e,t1_c2b3pan,t3_jd13e,1427448018,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

These 'people' are most likely unintelligent and disorganised. With a bit of organisation we can stop them. Either that or send in the military. Seriously. ",0,1312855873,null,0,false,0,c2b3tj1,t3_jcx50,t1_c2b3tj1,t3_jcx50,1427448072,5,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,5

&gt;They want to follow the rappers and athletes who live ghetto-fabulous lifestyles based on natural talents, as opposed to learned skills. 

This is interesting.  I think there are two relevant factors that have made the situation of these youth quite unique.

The first is that they live in a world where there is a surplus of young males, as technology and automation have replaced a lot of jobs, and there haven't been major wars to reduce their numbers.

The second is that they live in a world where the usual ""boundaries"" (I hesitate to say discipline or conventional family structure, though those are part of what I mean) are no longer in place for many young people, but they are given a lot of rights and privileges that their parents and grandparents wouldn't have had access to.  While they still suffer hardships, the welfare state means they don't suffer the same hardships that people suffered 100 years ago, for example.  This does impact work ethic, because it is not financially worthwhile to do a hard, low paid job when the dole is there.

And I think these two issues lie behind a lot of the problems that we are seeing, and a lot of the anger (on all sides).",0,1312863678,null,0,false,0,c2b4hau,t3_jcsfs,t1_c2b4hau,t1_c2b4855,1427448384,10,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,10

Horses for courses, I suppose.  She certainly has had her moments of smugness, and there's even been a few occasions where you could file her under category 'dick', but I feel that the characters in S5-6 earn their moments of glory by being flawed from time to time.  It makes them more human.  

For all her jiggery-pokery, River is at her best when the mask slips a bit and we see the vulnerability.  My favourite was at the end of the Big Bang, where River has to give way to Amy for a final chat with the doctor.  The heartbreak on her face as she admits, ""He doesn't really know me yet"".

Goodness me, here we go again. The changes to student financing will make it **EASIER** for people from deprived backgrounds to attend university.

The fees are only paid back *if and when graduates can afford to do so*, and the repayment terms are more favourable than the previous arrangements. **IF YOU CAN'T AFFORD TO PAY IT BACK, YOU DON'T HAVE TO PAY IT BACK.** 

The average graduate earns £100k more net of tax than the average non-graduate over their lifetime. What is £9k/year in tuition fees to go to a top-tier university when you'll go on to earn hundreds of thousands more over your lifetime? **IT WILL STILL BE THE BEST INVESTMENT MOST PEOPLE WILL EVER MAKE.**

It's also still going to be the best debt a person will ever get. If you lose your job and can't keep repaying, you stop repaying. The bailiffs are never going to come round. It's not going to affect your credit history. It's not going to stop you taking on other debts (car loans, mortgages, etc.)

It makes me physically sick that, while the changes will undisputedly make it *easier* for those from low-income backgrounds — those worst affected will be those from middle-class backgrounds, hence the pathetic middle-class riots we saw in London — certain political elements are responsible for creating a *perception* that the opposite is true.

With all due respect, I don't think you know what you're talking about.

Under the changes, the payment threshold was increased to £21,000. If you don't earn more than £21,000 — **WHICH IS MORE THAN MEDIAN GROSS ANNUAL EARNINGS OF £20,801** — you don't pay a penny. 

If you earn £15k/year for the rest of your life, you won't pay back a penny of the debt. You will have no hassle. It won't stop you taking on any other debt. The debt will be cancelled after 30 years. You got a world-class university education for free. **FOR GOODNESS SAKE, IF YOU CAN'T AFFORD TO PAY, YOU DON'T HAVE TO.**

&gt; Below are some numbers that will hopefully show you how this increase in tuition fees will affect various classes

It goes without saying higher earners will end up paying less debt. That's not unfair. That's how it is at present.

You calculate that each of those ""classes"" of people (an incredibly crass way to put things) will end up paying total sums of £39k, £44k, or £28k over the lifetime of the debt. **WHAT YOU ARE MISSING IS THAT THE AVERAGE GRADUATE EARNS £100K MORE, NET OF TAX, THAN THE AVERAGE NON-GRADUATE OVER THEIR LIFETIME.**

So in the **ABSOLUTE WORST CASE** that you end up paying ~£50k back over the lifetime of the debt, you are still on average £50k better off over your lifetime than the average non-graduate.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt; You could use that argument for anything that you pay tax to fund say fire fighting you yourself may never need their services but if you do then they are there ready to help you because of the tax you payed. The tax is not paying for something you WILL need but for something you MIGHT need, say that ""hard-working single mother"" then wants to go university but can't afford the fees then having lower tuition fees but taxes marginally increased spread evenly across the people of Britain would allow her to get an education.

No, you can't. The two are very different. Payments for emergency services can be modelled as an insurance. Just as you pay for car insurance, you pay for the emergency services without knowing whether or not you are going to need to claim their support. Just the knowledge that the emergency services are on hand is itself a benefit.

It is not possible to know who will need the support of the emergency services, but *obviously* it is possible to know who will want to go to university. They apply, and register, and go to university.

Society *does* derive some benefits from there being a large number of university graduates, but in the aftermath of Labour policies, the country has reached saturation point. We have *too many* people taking degrees, and not enough working for vocational qualifications, hence graduate unemployment. 

What's the solution? Raise the cost of going to university, so the few that are doing the most worthless degrees and will derive the least benefits from those degrees realise that alternatives may be more suitable.

&gt; Because there may be a course that you want to do because you are passionate about the subject even though it is not well paying, but before the increase in tuition fees you would of been able to do those courses but now the only courses that you are left with are ones purely designed to allow you to make money

If you are passionate about a subject and what to study a degree even though the degree will cost more than it will benefit you, then you can pay for it yourself (i.e. through repayments on the debt). No one is stopping you doing that.

Whether you like it or not, university education is extremely costly. People shouldn't be getting worthless degrees just for the sake of it.",0,1312888766,null,0,false,0,c2b674o,t3_jcx50,t1_c2b674o,t1_c2b65r1,1427449267,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

We have also consistently had one of the most benign systems of government in the world for at least 350 years, which has been copied with success by hundreds of other countries.

Except it isn't worthless. I bet you've bought something in the last day or two without needing a wheelbarrow full of money. Inflation is currently about 4%, which is quite reasonable. In fact, deflation was considered responsible in part for the severity of the last massive financial crisis, the Great Depression. The inflation which results from QE helps avoid deflation, which is the greater immediate threat. Economics is hard, it's not all a conspiracy agaist you.

There are two basic answers, the short term one: A spontaneous riot kicked off after a protest about a police shooting on Saturday night, the Police completely failed to deal with it and a lot of people got away with stealing a lot of stuff. Then a whole section of the youth realised that they could probably get away with it also so started congregating in shopping centres and robbing them burning them and baiting the police. 

There is probably a longer range answer; In that over the last couple of decades or so, an underclass of totally dis-enfranchised youth has grown up, with no prospects and no future. They spend their time hanging about,causing trouble, doing drugs etc and dodging the police. When they are caught the system has failed to deal with them adequately  with either carrot or stick.

 In short many of our cities have been sitting on a powder keg of hopelessness and low level crime. Summer holidays a little local protest and police failure were all that was needed to kick it off.

You have to separate this out into parts to deal with it. Right now we have an immediate problem with vandalism, looting, violence and attacks on people, and we need to deal with that first. Once that's stopped you focus on catching the people that you can, and then other people start looking at why it happened. Part of this was a protest gone bad, part was people simply being angry and part was people who simply wanted free shit.

The worst thing you can do is let these twits on the street define you. You have as much in common with them as any white guy in here reading this. Unlike the US there isn't this giant divide between the average black guy in the UK and the average white guy, culturally. Even in terms of the underclass, can there really be that big a gap between a mostly black sink estate in North London and a similarly poor but majority white estate in Liverpool, or Glasgow? Drug use, high crime, high incidents of teenage pregnancy and single parenthood. It's all the same for the UK underclass, a class you are not part of.

The people inclined to see black faces and black faces only are not worth your time and not worth trying to convince. They don't *want* to be convinced. This morning, despite the video showing a black kid and a white kid rifling through a wounded kids backpack and the white kid seemingly retrieving what looked to be a PSP and triumphantly sauntering off, a single commenter decided it was filthy ""niggers"" that should bear the brunt of his impotent rage.

""As Seen on BBC America"" is just a marketing thing, where they are reminding the people in the store what channel they may have seen this show on.

It does NOT refer to whether or not the episodes on the DVDs are edited or not.

Saying this though, it's weird, at the same time I realise that this violence currently happening has nothing to do with actual oppression or an actual direct statement. It's very vague and very stupid but I believe it is a symptom of something bigger that is going wrong in this country right now and in the same vein that the MP scandals and corruption were a symptom of the same thing. And yet in both instances the general public's reaction was to moralise and tut and not really try and find much of a solution. I'm not sure why this is, and I'm sure it's not just Brits that do it, but I believe there are genuine gaps in communication happening right now in our society, and it's a malignant tumour that is growing in our society.

It is high time to play the race card...

It seems the vast majority of those rioting are black, and the spark that gave them their excuse for this wanton theft and destruction was the police shooting a black man who waved, and possibly fired, a gun at them.

Anyone surprised?

If you take blacks as a group, as people like Darcus Howe seem to be doing, then you would be hard pressed to find a group who has had an easier ride for the last few decades.

Not only do those people rioting have state education that is the same as that available to everyone else in the UK regardless of skin colour, but they have ""free"" housing in one of the most expensive cities in the world, they get benefits, they get positive discrimination where by certain roles have to interview ""minority"" candidates. They have had the language modified and laws created to make discrimination against them both illegal and socially unacceptable. 

And still they end up wrecking the place, just like it was Zimbabwe or Soweto.

Anyone who is under 30 wouldn't have any memories of the ""No Blacks"" signs in London in the 1960s, no memory of Enoch Powell's rivers of blood speech, barely even a fleeting memory of news reports from apartheid South Africa. You probably would remember a black US President being elected by a far more racially divided nation than the UK. You probably would remember a black Formula 1 world champion getting the full support of British fans. You may well have noticed that every government brochure, advert and TV commercial features a black face. Yet still they have a chip on their shoulder about fk knows what.

Perhaps about the fact that they continually fail, where Indians, Chinese and nearly every other immigrant group succeeds in making a go of life in a civilised society? Perhaps the fact that they remain at the bottom of nearly every table measuring academic, social or financial achievement? 

Or just perhaps it's because every spokesblack and quite a few white politicians and assorted do-gooders give them an excuse every time they screw up. And because their serial screwing up has got them more attention, more resources and more excuses every time. 

How about this, to the black community:

Your community is a mess because you have done nothing to improve it. Your children fail at school because you do nothing to push them to succeed. They then go on to crime, drugs and prison because you do nothing to control them, or encourage them to live by the laws of the society they are in. 

And if you think this is getting one back at whitey, or settling some long forgotten score you know bugger all about, think again. Shops will be rebuilt and restocked, cars will be replaced, broken bones will heal, but your community and your people will remain in utter squallor, economically, intellectually and morally, until you yourselves do something about it. And this sort of disgusting behaviour will hurt nobody more than the honest, law abiding black people who live in England and actually do want to go ahead and make use of the opportunities available to them to improve their lot in life.

Grow up. Put away your stupid gangsta rap videos. Take the chips off your shoulders and have a good hard look at the source of your problems. Will burning down shops and attacking policemen really help you solve any of them? Or will it only serve to further alienate you from civilised society and erode the massive good will that you have been on the receiving end of for a generation and more.

Yes, but this is not what you described. 

Imagine this. A group of people (lets disregard race, religion or gender and think in generics, then the logic will be sound no matter where it's applied) like to read a certain paper more than another group. This is found when the paper does a survey of their readership demographics for say advertising purposes. Now say also that same group also are established in a certain area and therefore are most likely to work at the main local employer. So the local employer is now looking to fill positions. They put out an ad in the paper that the people in the area favour the most...they themselves are unaware of demographics of readership or such things. Add to that that the group we're talking about pass this news on via word of mouth to their family and close friends who are most likely of the same group. 

The effect of this is that this group is most likely to fill that position. It's not deliberate...it's not racism. It's just that the system is already stacked against other groups before we even get started.

So you get another group. A smaller group and they have a paper that caters to their needs a little closer. It's almost the same as the other paper but it advertises the foods and shows they like more prominently while reporting the same news. Some of this group also read the more popular paper too, but they're a small percentage.

All that happened with the police and fire services is they also advertised in that smaller paper. At no point did they *only* advertise in the smaller paper, as reactionary BNP voters would have you believe...all they did was run initiatives **along side** the usual running initiative. The exact same number from the first group would still see the ad, but this time a little higher number of the other group would see it too. So yes, by sheer mathematics, the likelihood of the first group filling the position is now marginally lower, but that's not the same as the position being taken away from someone in that first group to accommodate a person in the smaller group...that would be illegal.",0,1312911878,null,0,false,0,c2b8onk,t3_jdggb,t1_c2b8onk,t1_c2b8jla,1427450440,0,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,0

true,[deleted],null,null,"My only concern is; Why are black people routinely the subject of poverty in primarily white countries?

The UK is pretty damn good when it comes to social mobility. I wonder if it's cultural. Not to Britain, but to black people. Not all, of course, but in the same way that Orientals will culturally force their children into study, and how white people culturally drink like tankers, is it possible that there is a culture of [Crab Mentality](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crab_mentality) in English speaking blacks?

I ask this honestly. A lot of my black friends believe that it is the case that once black people are in poverty, they culturally ""stick together"", with the negative associated downside of ""you can't leave"". Those who do are often intimidated, and those who don't are doomed to have children who repeat their mistakes.

In the case of the UK, I don't believe that black people are more likely to be in poverty due to institutional raciam, since honestly, any educated black person has no more of a difficult time than an educated white person at finding a job, and an uneducated black person only has to be a little more polite than the average chav to get a job.

Also, despite prison populations, I'm going to say that classism is the real issue here. White lower class and black lower class are the same people. Some of my family are lower class, a lot of the people I mixed with were lower class. Since I'm of mixed heritage, I know white, black and mixed lower class who are very close to me, and I can safely say that the differences are not many. The sad thing about this riot though is the racial percentages. They're too far off for the public not to notice it, and too much for me to just ignore it. I want answers as to why it was so disproportionate.

PS/Edit: Now I mention it. This mentality is perhaps inherited from the US influences. It seems the blacks here who are in poverty often remind me of American blacks in poverty.

Some are simply opinion and as such are your belief of how things are. I could give *my* own set of anecdotal tales that form my opinion and we'd get nothing out of it, so charges such as black Britons getting the easiest ride in the UK over the last few decades, I'll not touch. I don't believe it, you do. Niether of us can substantiate any part of it so what to do but agree to disagree?


* They have had the language modified and laws created to make discrimination against them both illegal and socially unacceptable.

Who is they? There is no specific legislation written or worded for black people in mind. Sorry, you can't call people a paki, a kike, a wog, a chink, a wop, a dirty pikey mick or  filthy Francophile frog without some of those people taking umbrage and possibly getting in trouble with the law. Going back to Cromwell the people of Britain have always had a problem in some sections with people ""not from here"" even if they shared the same skin tone. Racial equality legislation wasn't drafted for black people.


* You may well have noticed that every government brochure, advert and TV commercial features a black face

Conjecture and bluster. One of things people say thats unsubstantiated and not very well thought out. The sort of thing easily disproved and will untimately reaveal a simple confirmation bias in which you don't ""notice"" white faces as they're just the norm to you but a single black face is amplified in your memory to inhabit the spaces you hadn't filled in already. I worked for the civil service. The agency I worked for produced many leaflets. What you say is not true.

* Perhaps about the fact that they continually fail, where Indians, Chinese and nearly every other immigrant group succeeds in making a go of life in a civilised society? Perhaps the fact that they remain at the bottom of nearly every table measuring academic, social or financial achievement?

I will concede. Black boys are some of the lowest achivers in British schools...but they're not at the bottom.

true,TabascoAtWork,null,null,"Every show (in the US) does this.  They're called syndication cuts.

Now, for *Doctor Who*, it's different - a 60-minute episode that needs to fit in a 45-minute slot (60 w/commercials) will be aired in its entirety (likely in a 90-minute slot with commercials) the *first* time.  Any time after that, it will be cut down to a 60-minute slot (45m w/commercials).

Even episodes that go slightly over (like 47 minutes) will have a few scenes cut to fit into the standard slot on its re-airing.

For US-produced shows, syndication cuts are done a few years down the line when ad time has been increased.  For instance, episodes of *Seinfeld* are ~25 minutes apiece.  But nowadays, a half-hour slot is really only 21 minutes plus commercials (instead of the early 90s, where it was 25 minutes).  So for syndication (reruns), they cut 4 minutes out.  (Older shows like *MASH* [that's impossible to italicize properly on Reddit, so I left out the asterisks] suffer even more, as half-hour episodes then were closer to 27/28 minutes, so they cut so much out that you often lose important plot moments/resolutions.)

true,me1505,,Derry,"Basically, don't ask don't tell.
Try not to call someone Irish/British before they do, same with NI/the north, and Derry/Londonderry.

There is almost 1000 years of British involvement in Ireland, and for most of it, the Irish natives came out pretty badly. Usually treated as second class citizens at the very best of times, slaves and left to starve at others.

Another major point is religion, Ireland has been very strongly tied to the Catholic Church for hundreds of years, so when England started its whole randomly change religion with every new monarch thing, Ireland got messed up in the turmoil.

England eventually became consistently Protestant, and Catholicism was basically the poor man's religion in Ireland, going as far to become illegal.

This continued, with several failed revolutions, until fairly recently.

Loads of movements, fairly influential one by Wolfe Tone to preserve Irish culture etc

Politics/violence here
Home Rule
More explosions
Negotiations between Nationalists (Ireland leaves) Unionists (Ireland stays British) and the British Government

1922- Independence for the Irish Republic. 26 counties leave with a capital in Dublin.

6 remain as part of Britain (NI)
Basically, the four predominantly unionist counties (L/Derry, Antrim, Armagh, Down) plus two more (Fermanagh and Tyrone) to make it big enough to actually work.

Catholics have no jobs or votes (votes decided on how much tax you pay on property, Catholics have no property ergo no votes. Also Gerrymandering)

60s, due to improved schooling system for Catholics, the first wave of educated Catholics tries to join the workforce, no joy.
Upset about civil rights (no votes)
Start a civil rights movement (NICRA) to fight for ""One Man One Vote""
Peaceful protests ambushed by police, police brutality filmed by Irish TV network RTE

Escalation of violence, eventual return of hte IRA, originally to protect nationalists, quickly devolves into tit-for-tat attacks with unionist paramilitaries.

Lots of bombings happen here.

90s- ceasefire reached, paramilitaries decommission guns, those in jail released, lots of the alleged leaders go on to become MLAs in NI's new devolved parliament in Stormont.
People in NI can choose to be Irish or British, passports easily available from both.


Now, bunch of twats trying to start shit mostly, very little support apart from in some extreme areas.
Still a strong peaceful wing though, which mostly condemns the attacks and works towards a United Ireland.

RAAD basically shoot drug dealers (some would say the competition) under the guise of republicanism.

true,haywire,eng-sussex,Brighton,"I think that the previous generation has to take much responsibility for creating a society that produces these people. A society that idolises material gain, competitiveness, and selfishness is one which produces angry, inconsiderate, selfish people.

Apart from a very rare few, people don't come out of the womb and decide that they're going to be massive shitbags. The current state of society, parenting, and system leads to them becoming that way. How do you expect someone to show love and care if they've never been shown love and care?

The key is decent education, and breaking the cycle of shitty parenting and fucked up families, and this starts with saying that stopping poverty and focussing resources on improving the worst parts of our society is more important than peoples' freedom for unbridled material gain.

And as a second note, authoritarian responses to this sort of things aren't going to fix it, they will escalate it. The more authoritarian a country, the more angry its people. The less people give a shit about the state and the people at the top, the less their hearts are going to bleed when their exploiters get their shit fucked up.

Like so:
You have 1/10th of a cup at 5C (milk)
You then fill 9/10ths of the cup with 100C water.

The average temperature will become: 1 * 5 + 9 * 100 / 10 = 90.5C

That's a lot cooler than 99.5C. So let's just say 100C is enough to damage the leaves (I don't know whether it is, I'm just arguing physics here), and 90C isn't. Then you're not going to scorch them.

I don't know enough about the gun laws in the UK to know how easy it is now for the criminals to get firearms.  Sadly, making it easier for law abiding citizens to get firearms will in turn make it easier for the criminals to do so as well.

However, prohibiting law abiding citizens from having the firearms to protect themselves, their family, and their property doesn't seem right to me.  I'm just glad I live in America where the god given right to personal defense is not prohibited.  We don't like waiting an hour for the cops to show up and ""protect"" us.

It's easy to make a sweeping generalisation about the rioters when they're looting small businesses and such, but I really do hope they march on Parliament.",0,1312917088,null,0,false,0,c2b9hxy,t3_jdd6f,t1_c2b9hxy,t1_c2b89ag,1427450822,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3
true,[deleted],null,null,"It's 90% community.

My mother raised me. She's a chav. She didn't do an amazing job, but, it was the people I met in school that made my life. I was in a posh area and I made friends with some upper middle class kids. These days I'm doing crazy shit like flying out to the middle east to live with my fiancée, meeting bank managers, making money, getting a top degree.

My younger brother ended up very different. Our mother raised him worse. He was younger during her drug spell and he took it hard. My father left when he was very young. My brother made some bad friends in school, mostly due to his interest in football and ""going out"". Half way through secondary school dropped out due to a severe OCD complex and thanks to our family and the community around him, he got therapy and returned to normal. He got a few GCSEs and is now applying to be a fireman. He's a little bit dim sometimes, but he's a good kid. 

His friends that nearly dragged him down though... they're all criminals now. He got away thanks to his OCD. He couldn't leave the house for 3 years, so he missed the Year 9 to Year 11 period of school that ruins a lot of people. 

He was on his way to becoming one of them. He spoke like them, joined in with their petty crimes and generally had a bad attitude. But, a few years of being stuck in a room changed him. He even asked me why his old friends still act like children. I replied that they simply didn't have the chances he had. Despite going to school daily, they got less GCSEs than my brother who didn't attend for the whole GCSE period.

These days, he's your typical working class young adult male. He has prospects, and isn't a lower class chavscum, but, if he hadn't dropped out of school due to a mental illness, he'd have gotten stuck with some of the worst young criminals in our town, and I know, without a doubt, that he'd be one of them.

Community makes a massive fucking difference. We live in a posh area, and both went to secondary school in a bad area. Everyone from my council estate in the posh area has ended up above the average council estate citizen, while my family and ex-friends who lived in the worst areas are now criminal scum.",0,1312917135,null,0,false,0,c2b9i7u,t3_jdf1n,t1_c2b9i7u,t1_c2b6spk,1427450826,17,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,17

These kids are venal, lazy twats...who have been let down badly by their education system and social care system. 

The subject of all this rioting was a nasty criminal scumbag who was carrying a loaded gun...who faced, on his last day, a cop who was too trigger happy so much so he ended up shooting his own collogue in the chest due to his carelessness.

*Some* of these kids make trouble, commit crime and bring attention to themselves, giving a bad name to the good ones... attracting heavy handed and sometimes racist cops, who give a bad name to the good ones.

The first thing steps in with is when he begins talking to ask him to clarify on a specific point he says about the riot, that he is not shocked.  All she says is ""let me stop you there"" and asks him to clarify an early point before he goes onto something else.  That's fair enough, she can't ask him when he's gone onto another aspect.   She gets him to clarify and then allows him to carry on.

He then starts making wild allegations about an ongoing investigation, so she interrupts, as she is legally obliged to, not to stop but to clarify that it is an ongoing investigation and nobody knows yet.  She then tries to get him back on track by addressing the social issues facing young people.

He responds by saying they have been stopping young people and blacks.  Well it's a young black neighbourhood with African-caribbean centric gang crime, and we all know that, but he says for no reason at all because he has ""a grandson and he's an angel.""  Well, you can just see the producer's head fall into his hands at this point.  *'Really?  That's the level of his insight, his grandson is an angel and a conversation angel had with his grandson.'*  There is no insight there...but she let's him finish and then says ""but that's not an excuse.""  

He then tries to link it to Brixton in the 1980s and Syria!  At this point Papa is off the reservation!  She tries to make it topical by linking his role in the Brixtion Riots, he was a leader of a militant, black political organization and has served time for attacking a police officer in the past and the mindset of the rioters.

He responds with ""Have some respect for an old West Indian Negro.""  Pathetic.  He doesn't even want to address the reason why he's in a position to be asked to do an interview!  He gives no insight. 

She tries and she tries to keep him on point, relevant and to the facts.  She tries asking discerning center stage questions and he just rambles off into the wings.

The [first image](http://i.imgur.com/V2yhX.jpg) is just the clean Andromeda Galaxy wallpaper in case you don't have Lion. The next five are just the TARDIS at different spots at different angles. The [sixth](http://i.imgur.com/77qzU.jpg) is all of the last 5 combined, which if you were to animate them in order should make it look kind of like the TARDIS is getting closer over time.

I'm not sure on this, but if you put multiple copies of the unmodified version between the ones with the TARDIS (possibly renaming them so that they always fall in the right order) you should be able to have the TARDIS disappear completely between locations.

Pick and choose the ones you like! Take one or take them all!

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt;Do you not understand what an interview is? 

Yes but you clearly don't and who said it was about agreeing with him?  

You don't need to ask somebody why they think it's relevant that he's saying black youths are being stopped regularly by the police.  It's self explanatory with anybody with a rational mind.  He's said it.  She understand he's said it.  It's not Newsround.  Fact is his argument is utterly irrelevant, people being stopped and searched, as she quite rightly says is no excuse.  But that's the excuse he gives.  


His information about searches?  He says he's talked to his son and grandson. Immediately irrelevant and secondary.  You don't know the context, you have to suspect neither does he.  You don't know if its hyperbole or not on part of the 'angel' grandson.  Hardly insight or eligible testimony.  He's not addressing the reason why he was being interviewed.  At least she let it go about the son who raised this 'angel'.  He has no room to complain about being stopped and searched and any testimony based on his say so is directly compromised by previous convictions in both petty and organized crime.  

&gt;trying to talk over him regarding searches, Brixton and Syria was bad form. 

The former Blank Panther leader is trying to make these riots about race just like the Brixton riot in '81, and it has nothing to do with it, apart from maybe the mindset which she specifically asks him about and which he ducks!  She asks him, that he personally knows this mindset and what's its excuse.  He's been in riots before.  He's seen it first hand.  What's their excuse?   *The one thing he's an authority on but he responds, ""Have some respect.""* 

&gt; However trying to talk over him regarding...Syria was bad form.

You're having a laugh if you think this has anything to do with Syria.   It's ridiculous to even entertain that you think an interviewer should let the interviewee go wherever they want even if it is so incredulous, unrelated and offensive.  It's contemptible to try to relate the looting and feeling to what the people involved in the Arab Spring have had to go through/are going through and to portray it as a massive popular movement.

It's beyond contemptible.  It's deluded.

The old man was asked to give an interview because of a unique insight he had.  When directly asked about it he balked.  He wanted to talk about other things.  She was asking 'whats' and he was trying to give 'whys'. She was asking the questions but he as a former presenter who built his career originally out of racial tension and militancy didn't want to revisit it.

Yes.  I do understand what an interview is.  You apparently do not.  She had every right to expect him to address her question, and was right to do so.  When she spelled it out for him what she wanted he said ""Have some respect.""  Interview over.  He doesn't want to address the questions he wants a platform to peddle his old race issues which don't apply.

I think you're thinking of the Big Bang - 11 says exactly that to Rory.

&gt;If I'm remembering correctly she told 10 that he, in the form of another regeneration, had given it to her right before she'd gone to the Library.

Both she and the Doctor are known to lie.  It would be a massive spoiler if she said ""my father gave it to me.""  Also, it could be that 11 (or whichever incarnation gave it to her) didn't tell her that it was the one Rory used.  I think this will be head canon for me.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt;So you don't see how recovering the focus by framing a question such as ""Are you tying the increased stop and searches by police with the current rioting?"" is more appropriate than how she actually chose to deal with it?

No, because it was absolutely obvious to anybody capable of critical thought that that is exactly what he was tying it with, which is why she said, ""but that's not an excuse.""  And she's right.  No rational person would ever accept that increased stop-searching, real or perceived, could justify burning Footlocker, robbing PC World and then torching a carpet shop and all the flats above it.  It is simply not a viable explanation.  She's also right not to dumb herself down and to labour self evident points as you seem to think she should.  Clearly he was trying to tie the riot to the number of police searches.  Clearly it's not even remotely an argument to rob a jewelery shop and burn homes.

&gt;""Yes but you clearly don't and who said it was about agreeing with him?"" Then goes on to list disagreements with him

An interview is neither about agreeing or disagreeing to the answers provided but making sure that the questions asked are answered and not avoided.  She's asking 'what', he's replying with 'whys' and then she's saying that even his 'whys' don't come remotely close to explaining anything.  She doesn't have to agree with the explanation to admit it is an explanation, even one of many.  It's not as if they were specifically targeting the police or government buildings - they were targeting shops and private property.

&gt;They knew who he was,

They were expecting him to talk about his own specific insights of a rioter's perspective and what their thinking was relevant to this specific event.  He didn't want to do that.  He wanted to talk about race and insurrection of the masses.  We know it has nothing to do with that.  1981  was to do with race whereas this has nothing to do with race and the vast, vast majority of the masses, young and old, rich and poor, left and right, are absolutely horrified what a small minority, many kids, have done.  

&gt;if they were expecting a nice marketable soundbite about how the violence is terrible or how it is justifiable that is extremely terrible journalism.

It would have been but they clearly weren't asking for that.  She pressed the point, she pressed the point and she pressed the point.   He was talking a lot factually inaccurate nonsense and not addressing the question. Eventually she spelled it out for him: that he knew first hand what the mentality of a rioter was.   He bailed with, ""Have some respect for an old West Indian Negro.""

Facts are he was there because he was a militant in 1981 that had an insight into a rioter's mentality and he would talk about anything but that.

true,[deleted],null,null,"Chav, from the view of someone who grew up as/with them, is something I'd only use on people who are criminalistic in the first place. I know a lot of lovely lower class people who dress like they're in their pajamas all day, but I also know a lot of scum who really don't deserve their state benefits.

I'm middle class now, as is probably obvious by the way I type (this is another identifier sadly) and my clear interest in social issues (another, sad, identifier).

But I see it this way; A lot of working and lower class people don't want to go to University. We can't force them of course, but if they have a child who does go to University, they often forget their prejudices and become ""dragged up"" with the child a few notches on the social ladder. I have a feeling a lot of it is envy that stems from the feeling that they were screwed over by their own community in school.

Alternatively you could always buy an away ticket from one of the lesser supported teams that don't tend to bring many people (e.g. Wigan) but then you can't enter wearing a Spurs kit/scarf/hat/etc.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt;I understand the whole 'disenfranchised youth' thing. Your assumption that I don't is frankly insulting and pretty pathetic as an argument.

You have failed to impress this upon me. 

Infact your tone (if what I sense is at all accurate) in that sentence contradicts your words. 

If some youth are disenfranchised, it is a serious problem, not something in quotations.

&gt;The simple fact is, no matter what they are facing, there is no excuse for burning out shops and cars belonging to people just like them. No excuse at all, despite what you say.

The thing is, you keep repeating this line and I keep telling you that I don't condone the looting or think is is excusable. At the same time I don't think calling the looters scumbags offers any insight. 

You seem to have expressed little else to me than the looters are scumbags. Talking about reasons and context does not excuse the shitty behaviour of individuals but calling them names is just anger and emotion, it's not insight or understanding. 

&gt;The fact that these 'disenfranchised youth' have things a shit load better even now than most of the rest of the world doesn't enter your mindset, does it?

Funny you should bring this up (actually, this is the first time you have brought anything up apart from your upsetness). 

I find myself rather preoccupied with this question. Having lived for a short while in Nepal, I feel very conscious of the amazing material privilege inherited by almost anyone born in a rich country. Despite existing pretty close to the bottom of the economic scale in England, I feel wealthy because I know what the majority of humans' lifestyle is. 

At the same time, how would you expect young, bored and futureless poor kids in our society to have gained any perspective about this? People exist in their societies and their perspective comes from that. You might be aware that there are studies that suggest that it is the degree of inequality in a society which breeds frustration and discontent. When ten percent of the population controls ninety percent of the wealth (don't quote me on the numbers, but it is something similarly horrifying), when schools are institutions for creating dumb kids and a compliant workforce, what do you think will stimulate the better part of people's personalities? 

&gt;They have no problem with resources. None.

Material resources are pretty meaningless once you have food, shelter and a washing machine. Anything that has been added to the comforts of the 1950's is redundant in terms of increasing happiness. 

Yes the kidz have an Xbox and a Blackberry but these are just part of the bread-and-circuses our mental society is throwing at us. We lucky residents of Western countries are merely a buffer between the super-rich and the downtrodden poor 90% of humanity who have been subjugated to their greed. 

&gt;Watch them. Actually watch these fucks.

I have watched them. Yes those are vile people doing vile stuff. Are you shocked to discover horridness? 

The looters are obviously not people with the moral fibre and upstanding decency we would like to see in all humans. Everyone gets this. 

In Yugoslavia and Rwanda people massacred the neighbours with whom they lived for years. 

A significant proportion of humanity isn't very nice. 

&gt;If you can't see the inherent clash of these two viewpoints (especially once you admit the exceptional lifestyle these 'disenfranchised youth' have), you need to review your outlook on life. 

If you think those are clashing viewpoints, you haven't understood what I am saying. 

&gt;There are no 'reasons' for this shit, only excuses.

Not true. There are reasons - watch society collapsing around you and the rich get richer and more deranged. Go look at the economic news.  

Go read about the methane and the dying oceans. 

The mass reacts to circumstance just like individuals do and the two things can almost be viewed independently of each other. 

&gt;As I've said earlier, dump these fucks in pretty much anywhere in Asia for a while, and see how grateful they suddenly become for the lifestyle they are allowed to have here.

I think that would be a very good idea (except instead of ""dumping the fucks"" I would frame it in more encouraging language). 

Six months volunteering with Cambodian orphans or something would be a real education for many people. 



I would offer the same for the people who holiday in Goa four times a year and never leave the hotel (hah, there is even a reality show about this now, brilliant). 

Unfortunately the moronic public would be up in arms because ""scumbags"" got a holiday.

true,SubGothius,tom-baker,Tom Baker,"I'm pretty sure item 2) has something to do with [River being quasi-Timelord, due to her being conceived aboard a TARDIS traversing the Vortex](/spoiler).

As I recall from old series canon, all Timelords and Gallifrey itself are mutually locked to a common timeline separately from the rest of the cosmos, so every time a Timelord returns to Gallifrey or encounters another Timelord, it's always subjectively after their previous encounter for all Gallifreyan parties involved. E.g., this is why the Doctor encountered the Master first always as Delgado's incarnation, then always Ainley's, then always Simm's, rather than all jumbled up. For some reason however, this time-locked synchronization [is inverted for River, the quasi-Timelord](/spoiler).

BTW, I think this is also related to the Moment that the Doctor was said to control at the end of the Last Great Time War, and ""time lock"" in which Gallifrey is effectively sealed off from the rest of spacetime. If the Doctor somehow found his way to a key, earliest possible moment in all of possible time where the cosmos still existed but Gallifrey did not, then as long as he remained in that version of the cosmos, Gallifrey could not touch him nor the rest of the cosmos in which the Doctor continues to exist alone.

In order to end the Time War, the Doctor had to deliberately relegate himself to a version of the cosmos where he was the last surviving Timelord, in order to block Gallifrey and the other Timelords from continuing to wreak havoc on everyone else. The Moment is just that, a key moment in all of possible spacetime, and the time-lock is simply the very same time-lock that has always synchronized Timelords and Gallifrey to each other along a common timeline.

This leads me to wonder if [River's conception was deliberately plotted to create a being with an inverted time-lock, so they would have a temporal agent who could possibly traverse the Gallifreyan timeline back before the Doctor gained control of the Moment](/spoiler), a plot which, as we already know, evidently never saw its ultimate fruition. The improbably enormous significance of Amy and Rory's wedding date comes back to haunt us here, since they *needed* the Doctor to show up and whisk them off [before their nuptials could be consummated, ensuring that would transpire aboard the TARDIS as it traversed the Vortex](/spoiler).",0,1312965950,null,0,true,0,c2bex5l,t3_je9us,t1_c2bex5l,t1_c2be626,1427453441,2,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,2

Every instance of collective human action is sociological, and riots on the scale we've seen represent a massive catharsis.

You see...that's that natural liberal sentiment I've had to, over the last couple of days, suppress in myself, much to my own shock and disgust. Eventually you will come to the realisation that projecting your own personality and disposition onto these kids will not work. ""Oi, get off with you or feel my boot!"" would probably have worked on me when I was 14...but it won't work on *these* 14 year olds. At the moment I'm finding it hard to articulate the level of ""don't give a fuck"" that's out there. 

I first experienced it about 4 years ago, the last time I went to the Notting Hill Carnival. Again, context...I'm 6'1...I weight just a little over 15 stone. I'm what is known in SE London vernacular as ""a big black bloke"". We were on a temporary bus service set up only for the carnival to ferry people from Notting Hill to specific places, with no stops in between...it wasn't a normal bus service. I was on the bus headed for Peckham when a couple of kids, around 12 years old, decided they wanted to get off at Victoria. Again, this is not a regular bus service...there was no PX bus stop at Victoria for this bus to stop at. These kids proceeded to bang on the exit door, ring the bell and shout at the driver. The bus is packed with hundreds of adults and we were basically at the whim and mercy of two 12 year olds...they didn't give a fuck. I eventually snapped and told the main one to stop pressing the bell. By now the driver had stopped the bus and called the police. The other adults on the bus decide now would be a good time to *turn on the driver*! It's his fault that these two kids are being twats. Again I snap and warn these kids to shut up, sit down and I even stand over them. They didn't give a fuck. They swore...they threatened...in their mind the stark age and size difference didn't matter...they *didn't give a fuck*.

These are the sorts of kids we're dealing with. A clip round the ear and a threat to tell their dad doesn't cut it. That time has passed and I think we need to adjust our thinking on how to deal with it.

In 1981, during the hunger strikes, large numbers of people took to the streets to show their solidarity with the prisoners. The greatest number of plastic bullets fired was between May and August 1981, the same period in which Bobby Sands and the other nine prisoners died on hunger strike.

It was during those years, that the vast majority of fatalities of plastic bullets were children between the ages of ten and fifteen. In October 1976 Brian Stewart, 13 years old, was killed in Belfast by a plastic bullet. He was shot in the face by a British soldier. Paul Whitters, aged 15, from Derry, died in April 1981 as the result of a bullet to the head fired by an RUC policeman.

**This is not race based.**

Despite Darcus Howe and other social pundits claiming this is the anger manifest of black youth pushed over the edge from  relentless stop and search / police brutality, this is not race based. You only need to look to Manchester where a majority of the looters are white.

** This is not consumer based**

There are plenty of countries who also have just as strong a consumer culture as we do. Take Japan for example - a huge consumer culture, yet during a time when looting could have been rife, there was none at all.


**This is not just poverty based**

I spent quite some time working and living in south east asia where poverty is far more extreme - often it can be abject poverty way beyond anything you would ever see in the UK. There is also a much greater level of class separation with some families having a huge wealth to other families getting by on rice and wild protein rich insects caught in the paddy fields. Yet meeting young people  'of considered lower class' in these countries was an entirely different to wandering an estate in North Peckham.


**So why is that?**

After some thought it occurred to me the main point of difference between the UK and the far east for sake of an example, was the strength and position of the family unit within an individuals life. There was much less separation and families are generally much larger by extension and valued of the utmost importance, way beyond the individual. Even when there is the case of a female as single parent raising children, she would still be surrounded by a large extended family of both matriarchal and patriarchal role models.


That is far from the case in the UK. When you are in the 'formative' years your entire life psych is being created and it is largely due to the presence and dynamics of your family. You will learn to walk, talk and more importantly act by observing them. Society really has at best a much more secondary influence here. If you have seen Dad walk out and mum be slightly resentful of you impinging upon her life as an individual it screws you up on a very deep level of your psych. 


I really believe a majority of these young people have seen their world (their family) broken and fragmented. When this happens when you are young its very easy in turn to adopt a destructive trend to your own life as its all you know.

Nope, if I'd intended that to be the analogy, I'd have said so, wouldn't you think? In my  example, it didn't rain for weeks and weeks and when it finally did you'd then be insisting that your prediction was correct. But my example doesn't involve proof or measurements - it concerns making a prediction that fails to come true for so long that when it does to call your assumption a prediction is untenable.

I can see both sides of it. The police are under a lot of pressure to enforce calm on the streets right now, and that means they are going to be less tolerant than usual. And she's swearing at them while carrying alcohol and admitting she's just been to a pub - which probably was interpreted badly by them.  They can fairly easily argue suspicion of being drunk and abusive towards them.

On the other hand, they should really not arrest people based on a single incident of swearing at the police - while it is against the law, surely they've got  better things to do. Technically they are correct, but morally it's pretty shitty. I'm assuming that it is the combination of being at a pub, having alcohol and swearing that's done it, but they've gone for the lesser swearing charge rather than for being drunk. 

The keeping in overnight is sadly pretty standard, especially if there was a suspicion of alcohol being involved, it sucks though :(

so I sympathise for her + your situation,  but also i think it's a case of both sides in the wrong - in a quiet night where there wasn't such a police presence, nothing would have happened, but she got caught up in something, reacted to it and came off badly to them, and it went from there.

Also look at the children of most European countries, still act and look like children, the UK has allowed business and social neglect to become rife and we now feeling the consequences of it as well as many other problems.

Also, my final point - the aspect of poverty is different in SE Asia, poverty isn't mixed with unhealthy qualities of materialism/consumerism, its purely for family, food and a roof over your head.

true,Ivashkin,null,null,"&gt; Could one not argue that the manufacturing industry became uncompetitive due to the actions of labour unions protecting their interests? I think that the trend to service jobs is something that can't really be prevented in a globalised world.

That's a big part of it, unions were intent on protecting and expanding benefits there members had, but at the same time our factories were old, out dated and simply not producing quality products. Poor quality products, constant striking &amp; work stoppages, and an expensive work force is never going to end well, especially not in an environment where you can move labour around to other nations, and Asia is starting to rise.

&gt; Also, do you have any sources that would list how much money was spent on the empire? I can't think it would have been that much relative to domestic spending. 

I'm not sure on hard numbers, but [this](http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/british/modern/marshall_01.shtml) is an overview for what I am talking about. The reasoning seems sound, and thus I would say that the problems we are facing now are largely because of the way we handled the post-war era.

&gt; For comparative purposes, what are your views on the French state? Presumably they have had the same experience as us since 1945?

I don't know a huge amount about the way that France did and does things. But on thing to remember is that France, Germany et al literally had to start again. After  years of war and occupation, everything was in ruins. Everything had to be rebuilt. from basic governance, to infrastructure all the way up to factories etc. It is also interesting to note that a lot of EU nations became very decentralized after WW2, where as the UK stuck to the war time centralization idea, with the entire nation being run from Whitehall.

&gt; And I have to agree, I really didn't think this riot had anything to do with race

The external status quo about the UK in the rest of europe is, the 'island' where there is still a clear upper and lower class. We don't think it;s about race, but it sure is about two or three sets of rights, multiple levels of entitlement. Different prices places on pretty identical human heads. There is little equality between the citizens of the UK.

&gt;(who seem to be making this into a civil rights uprising).

Which sound accurate to me. It takes a hord of hooligans to riot. But you need more than that. They wouldn't do it all at once. The coordination, the beliefs .. there is likely a minority of less 'hord' like individuals that were intentionally pressing the buttons of the hord. There has to be some intelligence and disciplined motivation behind such an event.

I am not saying it is justified. But we've had social outcasts here in Holland as well, and if we didn't make their environment more equal and more fair to them, the same would have happened. Especially, and this is quite crucial, if those groups are geographically clustered. Also, remember Paris? This is not an incident. It does not have to be racism to be segregation. There is a direct correlation to how you treat a certain class of citizen and these events.

Beyond the was-it-justified-debate, is the much more pragmatic debate, was it predictable and avoidable? And the answer to that question must be ""yes"". Is there some morally wrong with such a type of social segration?

Acting out while living with relative, who by this point cannot deal with him anymore.  Social work's response? Emotionally blackmail relative into keeping him.  Offer money so that can build an extension in their house to 'give him space'.  (Also, relative fails to follow through on any threats of punishment, allows him to misbehave, repeatedly buys him things he demands)

Gets to the age where he does not legally have to be at school anymore.  Is doing absolutely nothing to look for work.  Social work's response?  Offer him free driving lessons.  Get him on the housing register for his own flat.  Search out apprenticeship for him.

Of course, he never turned up to the apprenticeship, his behaviour escalated - and now he's in a young offenders' institute for assault.

A single working-class family members' wage could support a whole family and because one family member was always at home  we had less burglaries and more of that 'sense of community' apparently no one has today. 

Upwardly mobile people were put in the council estates and social housing. And eventually these families had the money and moved to the suburbs for more space, and because of the wide availability of the car they could still take the jobs in the high employment areas- inner cities.

And as in the article, consumerism took off. Get the latest washing machine, new gadgets to make home life easier, fancy suits and TVs!... But, businesses have to grow; the country needs growth! And with only one wage earner? The economy needed a boost. Luckily, women were now 'allowed' to go to work which opened the economy to more growth and more consumerism. Good times!

Meanwhile, those inner city council estates were rising fast. They changed from affordable, well designed blocks into towering, characterless storage units at some point. No one really wanted to live in them. In them went the immigrants and lower classes to do the work in the city that didn't quite pay enough to move to suburbia. But, the welfare state promised to protect anyone who fell on hard times, and even provided free health care.

Thatcher came along at some point and the economy needed another boost! The state was a bit skint at the time so she needed to sell few things. And she also let the people in council homes buy their houses in order the state could stop subsidising them- it was a win-win situation. Those employed did just that, and quickly sold up and followed their predecessors to the suburbs. Sadly, those unemployed had to stay and it just so happened that in the days of yore, employers were not so 'politically correct' in selecting ethnic employees. But corporations took over everything and there was lovely growth again! A whole new economy based on banking, loans and multinationals kept everything going. Good times again! 

Vast swathes of inner cities were left with those surviving on benefits and doing menial jobs. Stigma attached to living there grew too. Crime, drugs, yadda yadda... bad schools and bad attitudes meant the suburbians kept the plum jobs in the city.

And consumerism, really just the country's insatiable need for growth, continued. But everyone forgot to mention to those in council estates that the adverts for big screen TVs (and sports wear..) were not directed at them. They see no next big boom coming at any time soon, and in any case, there's no other lower class to replace them when they themselves want to move to suburbia.

true,lngwstksgk,null,null,"Alright, let's see if I can remember how this goes (it's been a while since I attempted to think it all through).

1. The Doctor blew up the TARDIS at the end of Amy's Choice in order to escape the ""dream"". However, that was reality and everyone moved into a third dream, which is where they have been ever since. The point of this long dream is to keep The Doctor busy while the exploding TARDIS does what it needs to do.

2. The Dreamlord *is* The Doctor, or at least the Valeyard of the classic series. Here's where things get more confusing. I don't think that the Valeyard is so much an evil Doctor as he is a sort of antonym for The Doctor, a perfect foil in literary terms. So what if The Doctor were walking down a distructive path toward something we'd recognize as evil?

3. Assume that the dream we're in is an almost perfect reflection of reality. Why? Because The Dreamlord/Valeyard needs to show The Doctor what will happen if he doesn't allow himself to be killed.

4. The Madame Kovarian kidnaps [baby River](/spoiler) plot really is an attempt to kill The Doctor and stop him from becoming The Timelord Triumphant permanently. However, the Universe needs someone to keep the timelaws so it doesn't fall apart, meaning he can't just die until the time is right and The Valeyard has appeared. He has been running from himself.

5. Meanwhile, the companions are swayed into turning against The Doctor, seeing him willing to set himself in the place of a god (we've seen this theme since the RTD days) and fearing what he has become. Rory determines that he must act, though it means killing his friend, and dons the spacesuit.

6. The Valeyard, now the power-tripping ""evil"" Doctor's opposite, has taken on the characteristics of the original Doctor. He manipulates time and space to convince himself to blow up the TARDIS in Amy's Choice, thereby preventing [River's conception](/spoiler) and subsequent kidnapping, which is what triggers the whole Timelord Triumphant bit in the first place.

7. The Silence are essentially incidental, a sort of parasitical race feeding off the dream. The Valeyard ceases to exist when the dream does, having been a timey-wimey paradoxical manifestation of that world.

true,abw,cnty-uk,Surrey,"Damn, I was kinda hoping to see some *justified* use of force against rioters and looters, but I don't think this qualifies :-(.  Leaving aside the emotion for a moment, let's look at the facts.

The police are governed, like the rest of us, by the [Criminal Law Act 1967](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1967/58) which states that:

&gt; A person may use such force as is reasonable in the circumstances in the prevention of crime, or in effecting or assisting in the lawful arrest of offenders or suspected offenders or of persons unlawfully at large.

The [Criminal Justice and Immigration Act 2008](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2008/4/section/76) further clarifies this.  It says that the use of force must be **reasonable, proportionate and for legitimate purpose**, which is defined as:

* the purpose of **self-defence** under the common law, or

* the prevention of crime or effecting or assisting in the **lawful arrest** of persons mentioned in the provisions referred to in subsection

I think it's clear from the video that the police **weren't acting in self-defence**.  At no point did the ""yobbos"" threaten the police or give them any reason to think that they might have cause to.  

It also appears to be the case that the ""yobbos"" **weren't in the process of committing any crime** at that point in time (that's not to say they hadn't previously committed crimes, but right there and then, they weren't).  

Now, it could be argued that the first two suspects who cycled around the corner were in the act of fleeing and therefore the police were justified in ""taking them out"".  Knocking them off their bikes can be seen as using reasonable force to apprehend the suspects for questioning and/or arrest.  

However, the third suspect gets off his bike and steps away from it.  He doesn't appear to be striking any kind of aggressive stance or threatening pose and his arms are initially at his side.  He then raises his left arm in self defence as the first policeman lays into him with a truncheon.  He **falls to the floor** after the first blow.  I counted **9 truncheon blows** in total from two officers and at least 2 light-hearted kicks (well, more a prod with a foot).  Following this assault, the police officers appear to make **no attempt to question or arrest** him.  

Now I detest the rioting/looting scum as much as the next person.  It wouldn't bother me in the slightest to see police laying into people who are in the process of rioting and/or looting.  As far as I'm concerned, ""reasonable force"" doesn't preclude giving them a damn good hiding when they're caught in the act and the evidence is incontrovertible.

However, in this particular case it is my opinion that the use of force was neither reasonable, proportionate or justified under the letter of the law.  Rather, it is a clear example of **police brutality** according to [wikipedia's definition](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police_brutality): the intentional use of excessive force [...] by a police officer.

I don't doubt for one minute that these people were up to no good and they probably ""got what they had coming to them"", so to speak.  If they weren't out on the streets to cause trouble then they were fucking stupid for being out on the streets looking like they were out causing trouble.  But the law's the law, and the police should be setting a good example by following it to the letter.  

In this case, I don't think they did.  **I am disappoint**.

**TL;DR:**  They probably had it coming to them, but according to the letter of the law it was unreasonable use of force and thus qualifies as police brutality. ",0,1312980497,null,0,false,0,c2bfnmp,t3_je7mf,t1_c2bfnmp,t3_je7mf,1427453788,10,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,10

The problem with words (and symbols, etc. for that matter) isn't innate within them - ie. words don't have power, but the meaning people ascribe to them is a powerful force within society. Within Buddhism, the swastika is fine and you can be taken seriously when using it. In Europe, you cannot be taken seriously when using it.

Unfortunately you're in a society where you might as well be using a swastika as your symbol as long as you're calling yourself an anarchist.

It is just a marketing problem, and it seems lame and something a lot of people are stubborn about - but at the end of the day if someone's goal is porpagation/adoption of their political views, then things like this are unfortunately very important. Meanwhile if people want to sit around and circlejerk about how right they are they can keep calling themselves anarchists.

And I don't mean that offensively, it is just what seems to naturally happen - you must see it plenty of knee-jerk simply at using the term. How many people see /r/anarchy as ""oh man.. those guys.."".

The word *can* still be somewhat helpful, of course, but only to people who already understand what your views might entail. Eg. If you say ""I'm a libertarian socialist"" to someone you've just met, you don't misunderstanding from the get-go because either someone understands that term, or you get a chance to explain. If you say ""I'm an anarchist"" you might *not even get a chance to explain* because that person probably already assumes they know something about what you believe, and 90% of the time they are probably going to be wrong. I'd rather someone know correctly or ask, then assume incorrectly and not feel the need to even ask.

So finally, anarchy being a very broad term and having people who just want to watch the world burn use the same umberella term as you is uhh.. not helpful, shall we say :P

You can waste your energies on a ""take the word back"" campaign if you're more bothered about semantics than politics, but it seems like a wasted effort for me when you could be making *actual* difference instead.

Meh, it's your call - it's not something the entire whole of all anarchists needs to do at once, every single person who just uses a little more tact can make a difference. Once someone understands the views you can tell them that it's actually one of the many forms of anarchism if you like. If it's really that relevant or important.

You'd have to find him first.  

That, I suspect, is one of the root causes of the problem: no positive male role model to inspire them, no-one to teach them boundaries and put them in their place when they step outside, no-one to be the ""man of the house"" so that they don't have to and can carry on being kids that bit longer.

Of course, not all of them are from single parent families, and not all single parent kids turn out bad.  But I don't think it helps.

In my parents' generation, having a child ""out of wedlock"" made you a social pariah.  Men were expected to ""do the right thing"" and marry a pregnant woman (sometimes even if they weren't the father), with strong persuasion coming both from society and the woman's father, often at the business end of a loaded shotgun (hence ""shotgun wedding"").

In my generation (born late 60s), it became socially acceptable to have children without getting married, but the couple usually still lived together.  Eyebrows were raised when the parents didn't opt to ""stick it out for the children"".  Of course, that often led to unhappy marriages, but that was soon fixed when divorce became more socially acceptable.

In this generation it has become the norm, for the lower social classes at least, to get pregnant and have children with no expectation or intent for the parents to live together, raise the child together, or even have any regular contact with each other or the child.  No-one expects the men to hang around and raise their kids, because that's not what men do any more (I'm generalising wildly to make my point - I do appreciate that it's not all like that).  

I suspect the welfare state is also partly to credit/blame.  The tax-payer will help support a child (two children, three children, oh you've got four now so we'll give you a bigger council house for your children...) in the father's absence, so there's no need for him to hang around, as far as the baby's short-term welfare is concerned.  Not that the fathers have any money to support their children anyway...

So call me an old fuddy-duddy, but I'd like to see a return to more traditional family values (blimey, I'm sounding like David Cameron now, the shame!).  I don't care about people being married or not, but if you're going to bring kids into the world, then you have a responsibility, to your child, if no-one else, to provide a loving, caring and nurturing environment for them to grow up in.  Ideally, with a female mother figure and a male father figure, if at all possible (but that's not to say that single parent families or gay couples of either sex can't do a fantastic job of raising children - it's just harder).  With kids should come commitment

When it's a black/latino on those programs, it's offensive to the country:  ""Why don't you get a job?""  ""Why don't you get an education?""  At the same time, rich Whitey won't hire the black/latino.  The individual states are not eager to equally fund all schools.

&gt;During looting: Where are all the white people?

&gt;During cleanup: Where are all the black people?

[And another](http://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/jdecw/this_is_what_most_londoners_are_like_from/c2b8251):

&gt;How dumb can you be? How jaded must your world be if you cannot see the obvious reality that all the black failings are due to a low intellectual capacity? It has nothing to do with nurture. Do you believe you can improve the socioeconomic condition of chimpanzee just by throwing wads of money at the chimp? Blacks are a welfare race. They can only survive in a society built on technology based upon handouts.

[And another](http://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/jdecw/this_is_what_most_londoners_are_like_from/c2b72nb):

&gt;Yes, we're all being unfair. Black people are all very tired from last night looting, hence their absence.

[And another few](http://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/jdecw/this_is_what_most_londoners_are_like_from/c2b7ehq):

&gt;It is a FACT that 99% of the people in that video are White. (A cleanup video)

[Another one](http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/jdo1t/average_london_rioter/c2b93hz):

&gt;Redditards are going to great pains to portray these looters as white chavs, with little mention of the 80%+ that are African immigrants. Is this just polite fiction or are you truly that deluded?

&gt;It's not racist to state the obvious. Regardless, the black underclass is dysfunctional despite all of the efforts to accommodate them.

I wasn't implying the US wouldn't behave in that way either, that statement was to everyone who thinks it's a racial thing, not to the US saying that we have respectable black people and you don't.

Sorry for not making myself clearer, I actually don't think the UK is much better than the US in terms of most things, I was just trying to highlight the fact that the societies have different opinions integrated into them. For the UK, the racial divide was never a huge thing, whereas we still had ridiculous class differences in 1900 - there were still workhouses for the poor, and then the rich were ridiculously wealthy. For the US, the problems around those times were racial problems and the abolishment of slavery and so on. It's just a case of different problems being more prevalent in the two nations, I don't think either problem is better or worse than each other, other than that the class one is one that people can potentially change the cause of (people can earn more money so they aren't poor, people can't change their skin colour).

true,HugoRune1965,eng-yorkshire,Yorkshire,"My opinion is that these kids have been let down by their parents, by the education system and by the justice system. They have been let down because they don't see themselves as being a part of society in general. The only society they know is the society of their peers, and this is what Terry Pratchett (in the novel Unseen Academicals) refers to as a Crab Bucket.

In the novel, a character hears this term but does not understand it until she sees an actual bucket of crabs which has no lid on it. She is told that there is no need to put a lid on it because as soon as one crab attempts to climb out of the bucket, the others will pull it back down.

If you are a parent you will know that part of bringing up children involves rewarding good behaviour and giving consequences for bad behaviour. This sounds obvious but in fact it is more difficult than it might seem. When a young child is throwing a tantrum, the easiest way to stop it in the short term is to bribe the child, whereas providing negative consequences will upset the child further. Unfortunately in the long term, the child will learn that bad behaviour is rewarded more readily than good behaviour.

Our education system and our justice system is so obsessed with meeting targets that it is also not dealing with these kids appropriately so they fail to get an adequate education and end up with no aspirations. Take a look at [the Winston Smith blog](http://winstonsmith33.blogspot.com/) to see why the social care system and youth justice system fails to help these kids to become a functioning member of society.

There is very little doubt that the supermarkets have been acting as a cartel for years, since the dissolution of the Milk Marketing Board which functioned as buyer of last resort in the British milk market, thereby guaranteeing a minimum price for milk producers.

Even more disgraceful is the practice of buying in milk from abroad, processing it here (into cheese, yoghurt etc) then saying it is 'British'. The supermarkets do this with every kind of produce. The best thing people can do is think about what they are buying.

Too many Americans have opinions on British matters that they don't understand, often seeking to place the rioters as victims of society, or looking for reasons. When confronted, they claim it's ""just so complicated"".

But the thing is, it's simple. Very much so. They're opportunists, they saw a chance to steal and ""go wild"" with little chance of repercussion thanks to group anonymity. It's not ""Because they're frustrated with their poverty"" or ""because they're angry at austerity measures"" or whatever pollycock the American Redditors think it is. 

They then bring up race and act as if it is the whole cause because in the US, black = poor. Another clear ignorance from the Americans.

I simply wish they would keep their one sided view of the world on their side.

And I will claim that this is most Americans who reply on Reddit too. Not a small sub-group. They believe they have the answer, reply, then defend it. They aren't interested in learning the British, correct, perspective, but instead want to project their limited understanding of the world onto us.

Also, if there's a flight in the evening he could catch that cost the taxpayer money, or he could wait for a military flight (where the PM as an extra passenger would cost minimal amounts) at 3AM that still got him to London in time, does he not have a responsibility not to waste thousands of pounds just to get here a few hours earlier to look good?

Really this isn't something Cameron has done wrong (compared to any other Prime Minister ever that is, rather than in absolute terms), rather it's a flaw that all of Parliament goes on holiday all at the same time, leaving very little in the way of decision-making in a crisis.

But there's a huge difference between being part of a grouping that most people see as benign and will throw off a single bad act here and there as ""meh, that's life"" - and forget about it after 5 years.

And then a grouping like anarchy where people view them as largely dangerous, and are constantly getting reminded of reasons why they don't like anarchists - by people who call themselves anarchists!

Winners: Police (as an institution, I imagine the ones catching bricks could have done without it...); a couple of hundred knobheads who got some free stuff; Rupert Murdoch &amp; accomplices; right-wing politicians who now get the green light for heavy-handed policing, surveilence of social networks and generally dismissing the urban poor as a bunch of thankless, feckless, violent thugs. 

Losers: the dead and injured &amp; their families; people who lost shops / flats / cars / jobs; taxpayers (yes, all of us); legitimate protesters of the future (you know, with a coherent *cause*); anyone who needs an insurance policy; anyone who lives in an area affected which will now struggle even more to get investment, improvements to infrastructure etc.

It's soul destroying. Our society is NOT just, and people's voices do NOT get heard. There is often legitimate reason for protests. Protesting is supposed to get an argument heard, convince people that the protesters have a valid case, and move society towards acting in a way that the protesters want.

I don't condone their behaviour at all, it is sickening and it angers me. Part of me wants harsh punishments, I want to go vigilante and kick their asses.

But I can't deny that I may well react in the same manner if I were in their position in life. I come from a poor background but I got a lot of lucky breaks as far as opportunities go. But I remember being so poor that I burned with envy of people who were better off than me, seemingly by luck alone. How did they deserve their wealth while I did not? And then they behave as if this wealth makes them better than me. This breeds a powerful resentment.

I don't know what social changes can fix this. I think welfare spoils people and makes them feel entitled, but you can't take it away. 

I think a lot more needs to be done to keep those on the edge of society included, to give them opportunities. I hate to say it but the whole 'give them a stake on society' claptrap does ring true here.

true,FrabriziovonGoethe,null,null,"What I am saying is that our society has not been allowed to move past race. Look in the comments about this

Americans (in my experience) are obsessed with race.

    The British sprinter Kriss Akabusi had a famous run in (gettit?) with an American reporter when he was a member of the 4 x 400 metres relay team which took the gold medal at the 1991 Athletics World Championships:

    “So, Kriss, what does this mean to you as an African-American?”

    “I’m not American, I’m British.”

    “Yes, but as a British African-American …”

    “I’m not African. I’m not American. I’m British.”

    This went on for some time before the reporter got so flustered that she gave up and went to interview someone else.

True story. ""Awooga""

The reporter could not separate his achievement from his race and this is something that Americans are bombarded with on a constant basis. As far as being racist, I don't give a shit if you call me that because it doesn't mean fuck all to me since I have no power over anyone and am just tired of all of the ideas of race being an issue in the US instead of a persons character. I lived in South Korea for 3 years and didn't expect anything to be given to me or to be treated any differently then anyone else but when I got back to the States that's all I heard or saw. It was the worst during the 08 election anytime someone would bring up a valid point about disagreeing with Obama's policy or stances they were labeled a racist and the same is happening even now when they disagree with him or criticize his presidency.

Go to carphone warehouse first, demand they lower the price (say it's cheaper at phones4u or something), if they don't, just keep going to phone shops.

Most of the major industry in this country is gone, taking away all the jobs that straight out of school 16 year old barely qualified people would occupy. on top of that massive influxes of migrant workers over the last few decades have taken many of the jobs that these people would otherwise occupy (please don't do the standard thing of dismissing this idea with ""that's racist"", it is a serious concern).

Mass popular media may also be involved, the idea that being a ""gangster"" is somehow desirable and a legitimate form to conduct ones life. Sadly, some of their conditions may be self-inflicted. I went to the same school as many I would not be surprised to learn were involved in the looting, they had exactly the same opportunities as myself in terms of education yet their anti-intellectulism and desire to be ""ard"" or ""gangster"" has got them into the situation they are in.

also the so called ""Nanny-state"" has taken great strides in removing peoples sense of self-responsibility, that every misfortune in your life can be blamed on and solved by someone else.

They're worth a look if you can find them. The idea is to build two thirds of the new stadium around the outside of the current one over the course of a season. The following season we'd play in the unfinished stadium (which would have a similar capacity to the current stadium) whilst the current stadium was demolished and the remaining stands built in it's place, giving us a completed stadium for the start of the following season.

I think I'm remembering that right anyway. The planning permission has already been granted (requiring lots of concessions to the council and local pressure groups), and the club already owns all of the land surrounding the current site on which the new Lane will sit. So if we broke ground soon we could feasibly be in in two years time. That's not too likely though - it's a £400m project so the caution is perhaps understandable.

It's a pretty cool project and I'd really like to see it happen, though the stadium atmosphere will certainly be odd in that intermediate year. And they'll probably end up calling it something annoying like the Autonomy Arena.

true,tefster,uk,South-East,"I agree with you completely.

Whilst I agree with Hunt's point about UK TV being too centralised, I'd much rather see support for some centrally managed ""community"" channels with shared infrastructure - which were then all broadcast across the entire country - than I would a load of local channels which all end up struggling to survive and broadcasting for a couple of hours a day.

We've pretty much been here before with the ITV franchises (Granada, Tyne Tees, Carlton, etc) - seperate stations which ran independently but ended up (effectively anyway) merging back into a single ITV in the 90s

The big problem with UK TV is not the centralisation of broadcast channels, but the high cost of getting small niche-content channels on air and keeping them there - due to the limited number (basically 2, BSkyB and Virgin) of platforms that are available as transmission platforms, and the requirement to be advert-funded.

From the article :-

&gt;but advertising is likely to fund the services.

I just don't see this as a workable model. The TV advertising market in the UK is extremely difficult for small channels for three reasons :-

* TV advertising has had ever increasing competition from online and new-media advertising, thereby driving rates down
* To get decent advertising rates you really need to profile your audience and subscribe to BARB, then find staff to sell advert slots. Both of these require money, if you don't have that then you end up with a vicious circle of; a platform which needs advertising to survive, and no real way of bringing the advertising in.
* Niche-content channels inevitably have less viewers, and so advertisers will only pay a fraction of the price that they would for slots on the larger channels.

&gt;""There's a huge appetite for local news and information in communities the length and breadth of the country,"" Mr Hunt said.

Again I don't see this. Region-centric TV has not done well in the UK in recent years - look at Solent TV, East Midlands, etc - they rarely last very long for a number of reasons.

* Lack of content. Producing decent content which will keep an audience, and which is broadcast-quality, does not come cheap. Some of the prosumer video kit out there is capable of producing near-broadcast-quality content for less money than it used to require, but you still need to cover person-time. You can exist on volunteer goodwill for a while, but eventually you run out of that. If the funding that is to be used for starting up regional channels was instead spent on funding content producers and centralised staff then this wouldn't be an issue.
* Lack of funding. To run a TV channel requires content, technical and production staff, and revenue. I talked about ad revenue above, but having a bunch of independent stations all taking on their own staff can surely only end up with massive duplication of tasks.
* Lack of interest. Sadly most people would rather watch ""Get My Big Brother out of the Jungle while I Dance on Ice"".

I see there being far more scope for funded channels broadcasting niche-interest content. And that is content which is potentially of interest to people across the entire country - not just in one region - and so could potentially get better Ad rates. Time-shifting of content, through DVRs, TiVos/VTV, HDD Freeview boxes, etc is more common than ever and will continue growing in use - to the point where it doesn't matter as much about peak versus off-peak slots.

TL;DR - Don't go for regional TV channels - Use the existing infrastructure for local news and instead put all types of niche/special-interest content on some shared-infrastructure new channels, and use some of the money to fund niche content-providers.

true,[deleted],null,null,"As a Brit who lives in California: there's a huge race problem in the US which is completely tied up with class and poverty. Here's the problem. In the US poor places have shitty government services. Libraries, schools and a bunch of other government services are funded by local government, much of which is paid for by locally raised taxes.

The local government in the US is called a city (even if it's just a town, it's called a city). The city services are funded by a hodge podge of different taxes, including city property taxes, state income taxes and federal income taxes. In rich towns the libraries and schools have loads of money. In poor towns the libraries and schools have much less money. Consequently in rich towns there are good schools and in poor towns there are shitty schools. This plays out as a very strong correlation between race and class. People who grow up in poor communities get shitty educational opportunities. People who grow up in rich communities get much better educational opportunities. The poor people in black and Mexican communities tend to stay poor, because they just don't have the opportunity to get a good school education. They have even less chance to get a university degree because there's even less funding available for higher education.

None of this is discussed as a structural problem or a taxation problem by politicians and the media, or even by regular people very much. If it is ever discussed, it is discussed as a race problem (e.g. black people can't get an education). Consequently everything is seen through the lens of race, because race is actually a pretty good predictor of social opportunity. If you are black, its very likely that you have had shit opportunities. It is still the case that most black people are poor and most rich people are white.

(There are also a bunch of poor white people, called derisively ""white trash"" or ""hicks"", but that's a whole 'nuther conversation.)

You call Americans largely ignorant, then claim that the British have the correct perspective?  How is that even remotely serious?  Isn't there more than one side to any story?  Are things really that cut and dry all the time?  Are the faceless, nameless people on here truly a shining example of what most people in America are really like OR is it instead a sliver of an example of what people with a desire to sound off are like when they can hide behind the mask of anonymity the internet gives them?

Almost all things political related to the US are slammed on Reddit by Brits and yet none of those people live in the US, they still kiss the queens hairy knuckles, and you call us ignorant?  What if Americans harped on America for American policies and follies and kept their judgement of British aside and what if the Brits did the same thing?  Why don't you keep your crooked teeth and oral fixation with tea to yourselves and we'll do the same with our fanatical gun loving, poor people hating culture (can you find the stereotype humor here?  I like to point out my jokes so they don't get mistaken for seriousness.)

I was trying to read this thread for the Londoner's perspective on the rioting but have completely been hung up on your deragatory and narrow view of Americans.  If you think you're any less ignorant than another country, strictly based on where you're from- you're at least as ignorant as the people you're stereotyping.

How long have you lived in America?  You're an expert at putting us down but I'm guessing your perspective of American's comes from national and international bigotted news networks who only display what is most sensational and likely to attract viewership.

""They bring up race and act as if it is the whole cause because in the US, black = poor.""

Maybe other Redditors said that but as an scholarly and worldly Redditor of the beautiful UK, thankfully you were able to decipher that as misinformation, correct?  Being black does not equal being poor.  Being white does not equal being rich.  Being Asian does not equal being awesome at math or musical instruments.  Being male does not equal gun loving, hunters.  Being female doesn't equal whatever American female stereotypes there are...  Sorry, I drew a blank here.

It's pure ignorance on your part to say such boldly incorrect statements and then claim your own ""correct, perspective"".  If you were even remotely smarter than the most ignorant American on Reddit- you wouldn't say such categorically untrue comments.

Congratulations, you're as bad at life as everyone you lash out at because you lump American's into inaccurate and broad categories.  Oh, scholarly genius of a Brit- please try using your ""correct perspective"" to enlighten those around you.  If you had anything useful between your ears, you would invest more time in correcting inaccurate stereotypes by calling out people for their ignorance, rather than further detailing your own.  Americans are not the ignorant lumps you make them out to be, just like the British aren't all bad apples like this London Riot is making so many of them out to be, right?

Surely all British aren't that daft- in fact, I bet it is only a tiny fraction of one percent of people within London as we speak who are ""bad apples"" and opportunists and break the windows of businesses to loot for their own personal gain.  It seems ignorant to lump all British into this one category because of the actions of a few.

Try NOT stereotyping Americans because of a few bad examples.  It's amazing how different we all are.  I bet British are pretty unique individuals.  I bet American's are too.

I never said that all British people held my view. Nor did I say that some of us aren't hypocrites.

But the fact is, Americans make ignorant statements on UK matters. We are too ignorant on yours. I am preaching to both sides.

British people have the correct perspective on their own culture, culturally.

Let me just say one thing though to address your overall tone: You are being extremely negative and insulting to the whole concept of the UK. I merely mentioned some problems I find with ""too many Americans"", from Reddit (I wish I specified this now) and you blow up, and repeatedly, sarcastically, insult the UK.

true,Jamaicaman90,cnty-wales,Swansea,"I'm not saying black people by nature would be the ones to do this sort of thing.

Read this comment and consider my intentions in writing this carefully before replying in anger: this country is majority white. When groups of mostly people of a minority do something, it is noticable, as it is not a representative spread of ethnicity when compared to the general population. When a group of mostly white people do something, it is closer to the general population.

As a result: mostly white plus a small percentage of minorities doing something means it's not ethnically notable. Mostly minority with a small percentage of white people suggest it is linked specifically to the minority community. In London we saw people were travelling between boroughs to loot, so it wasn't as simple as 'of course they were black, it was in an area where black people live', as this group where travelling into areas where they did not represent the diversity of the local populace.

Again, I'm not claiming that black people are automatically troublesome, quite the opposite. I'm also not claiming white people have done nothing. I'm also not suggesting any of this is because of racial tensions. What I am saying is that you cannot deny the fact that certain areas of trouble, especially that of London, are being caused by people of the black community, and in these areas it's the black community that needs to be looked at to see why this is happening.

true,poop_on_you,tardis,TARDIS,"No - wedding night was June 2010 (which was supposedly where she conceived in the time vortex, according to AGMGTW).  She gave birth in April / May 2011.  Now, if she's a normal human in a normal gestation cycle, in order to give birth in May-ish she had to be about 8 months preggers when the Doctor called them to America on April 22.   But, if she did in fact conceive on June 26, that made her 10 months pregnant in April.  

If she really conceived on their wedding night then she'd definitely be showing at Christmas, and should have popped well before they were summoned back in April.  Personally I don't think that the Doctor was trying to pin down June 26 as the date of conception, he just became very aware of the fact that beginning that night they were doing the nasty all through the Time Vortex.  

Theory:  logically, in order for her to pop in May she would have had to conceive sometime in August.  It's not unusual to not be showing (or at least be able to hide some of the bump) at 4 months, there's no way she could hide that from Rory and they'd of course tell the Doctor.  BUT as of TIA neither Rory nor the Doctor knew anything about it.  So the odds are pretty good that she was taken between August and December (probably closer to August, early in the 1st trimester).  

I think the reason why they decided to go home for a bit had something to do with the abduction - what could make them forget WHY they left the Tardis and think that being at home and watching the Doctor's antics from afar (when it's doubtful that Amy would voluntarily leave him) was all perfectly normal?  What would allow the Clerics to take Amy early enough for even her ganger to not know she's pregnant without Rory or the Doctor noticing or remembering?  I think the Silence are involved somehow in her abduction, and the Ponds either were sent home or ""decided"" to go home (through the posthypnotic suggestion thingy the Silence do) to prevent the Doctor from figuring it all out. 

It starts to make sense when you wonder WHY the future Doctor chose April (just a few weeks before Amy's due date) to collect them all back together?  He could have summoned them earlier.  If he had got the band back together in, say, February and sent them to 1969 and on this adventure to discover what happened to Amy, they might have rescued her before she ever gave birth.  Which meant that Melody would have been born on Earth and Amy, Rory and Melody could have lived on their days happily ever after as the Pond-Williams Family (retired from the Tardis).  

But Future Doctor didn't do that because if his past self had figured it all out too soon, and Amy was rescued before she gave birth, Melody could not have become River.  The Clerics didn't want the Doctor to find Amy at all (or at least not before they had the child), and Future Doctor couldn't undo that because of who River has become.  So, they had to take her well before the Christmas episode.  To argue that Real Amy was in that episode suggests that she conceived between December and April, which makes even less sense than saying she conceived in June.

The only snag is the astronaut, and how it came to be there in April 2011.  Is that a pre-set date and the Doctor called them all to the lake that day because he knew it would show up?  Or was the astronaut just hunting him and would have appeared anytime they were all together?  From the trailers, it looks like this will be explained in the second half of this season.

I went to a game at the Lane last April, am not a One Hotspur member, and was able to get a ticket from the Spurs website to the North London Derby of all games. I paid super close attention to ticket announcements and was refreshing the page as they went on sale at 4AM local time for me. I managed to get a ticket, but the ones that made it to general sale were sold out within 15 minutes. (Interesting side note: if I had not gotten that ticket, I would have gone on vacation in Japan rather than England and was planning on going the week the earthquake/tsunami happened) 

For cheap accommodations, hostels are a great way to go. I stayed at [Astor Hyde Park](http://www.hostelworld.com/hosteldetails.php/Astor-Hyde-Park/London/25678) which was fantastic and is within a couple blocks of the Science, Natural History, and Victoria and Albert Museums if you're into that kind of thing. (I highly recommend the Science Museum). From there it was pretty simple to get to the Stadium using a combination of the Tube and buses. (There was a bus which went from right outside the nearest Tube station on the High Road to directly outside WHL. I forget the station names and bus numbers at this point.) I went for a week and roamed all around London, so I just bought a 7-day unlimited Oyster Card which worked out really well for getting around.

Edit: I think the Tube Station near the stadium was the Seven Sisters station, which is in zone 3. So if you go with the travelcard, you'll want to get it for zones 1-3 so you can use it to get to WHL and anywhere in central London.

In my example of Americans doing this, I intentionally wrote ""American tension with Mexico"" and not ""Mexican tension with Whites"" in order to make clear that I was referring to national problems like immigration, which is a class and economic problem, not cultural or racial. The accelerated influx of Mexicans (especially poor and undocumented) into America since the mid 90s is caused by trade agreements like NAFTA. As Alejandro Portes of the Center for Migration and Development at Princeton writes:
&gt;""Peasant agriculture has been eviscerated by the arrival of agri-business and the lifting of restrictions on the sale of peasant land. Industrial employment has been eviscerated by the closure of hundreds of plants unable to compete with the transnationals. ... Before NAFTA, undocumented Mexican immigration came mainly from four or five Mexican states and a limited number of mostly rural municipalities. Since NAFTA, migrants have originated in all Mexican states, practically all municipalities, and cities as well as towns and villages. A number of formerly vibrant places are now ghost towns, all their able adults having gone abroad; about one-third of all Mexican municipalities have lost population during the last decade, some by half or more. The counterpart of this hollowing out of the Mexican countryside is the growth of the Mexican migrant population in the U.S., much of it undocumented.""

Illegal immigrants are not here because they're too lazy to get here legally or want to benefit from American social programs without working, but because they lost their job to trade liberalization and have to come here to find one. This is why illegal immigration [began to decline in 2008](http://nymag.com/daily/intel/2010/09/report_illegal_immigration_to.html) as available jobs declined.

I like a lot of sci-fi though.  Even the stuff that has some sort of flat, two-dimensional chunk of flesh walking around that might be lucky to get a few lines of dialogue in (when I say chunk of flesh I mean no offense to the actor in particular, but more speaking to how they're portrayed - they are there for eye candy).  I'll tolerate that if it's got a good story, or if I just want to see a bunch of giant robots fight each other.  Honestly, at the time I'm watching, I really don't even think much about it because I'm more interested in the giant robots fighting each other.  

Something like Game of Thrones does make me a little uncomfortable because at times it's just plain overdone (even for that storyline which is saying a lot).  Of course that's Fantasy, but I draw it in to make my point about boobies.  The story is spectacular enough though that I'll raise my tolerance levels and just deal with feeling a little awkward when I see some tits for like the 500th time that hour.

At it's heart Doctor Who is closer to an adventure story than science fiction.  Of course, if you try to tell someone who doesn't like science fiction this they will probably laugh at you, but there are entire episodes that, if watched alone, would provide barely any hint of the science fiction elements at play. 

And sure, the hunky geeky look with the accent doesn't hurt.  But really it's the idea of being whisked away on an incredible adventure that's more appealing.

In fact it's this American-style obsession with so-called civil rights that semi-paralyzed the police on the first few nights of rioting, as they were basically scared to use force for fear of exactly the kind of criticism you're levelling at them. 

On paper, civil rights are a morally commendable and clear issue. When social order breaks down like this, however, paper concepts are useless and, indeed, damaging as we have seen. Since the police have been empowered to use more brute force, the rioting has calmed down.

To answer an earlier question you raised: we don't have a hard-coded constitution like in the US, we have common law which allows us to apply common sense to individual circumstances.

So my best guess would be, she is simply using a design she has had familiarity with and that the base design does not change too often or too much. Likely each model may come with idiosyncratic behaviors or options. Given her intimacy to the Doctor and her technical capabilities, she may have modified the device to give her the technical abilities she would prize most.

Now what is curious is the relative durability of each screwdriver. Some last centuries, some are damaged during the course of a day's work. So he must keep parts on hand or perhaps they are made of different materials of varying levels of durability.

He does not appear to be particularly attached to them, except when he needs it and does not have it (or perhaps when spare parts are low).

Lastly, Aryans would not let me in their clubs or attend their rallies, lol any other blind assumptions?

Others blame imperialism, but while Europe was poor and cold, Africa was rich in game, minerals, timber, and fertile land. While the rest of the world was making advances in science and technology, blacks were happy to hunt when they were hungry, seek out water when they were thirsty and rape when they were horny, never planning beyond their immediate needs. This is what we're seeing in London now. You can take the ape out of the jungle but you can't take the jungle out of the ape. You can't really blame them either - it's impossible to take that primal instinct out of someone when it's been instilled by hundreds of thousands of years of evolution.

We travel right, time travelers travel left or right, and all together, time itself progresses up, and nothing can go down.

Makes the most sense in context.

This means that the Doctor views the present as the height rather than the width of time as of right now, and so he views time traveling the same as we view third-dimensional space traveling, and the time line moving upward the same as we view it moving to the right.

He also failed to make an impact when on loan in the lower divisions - he barely got a game during a spell at Ipswich when he should have been showing the quality to walk all over the Championship.

Now he's finally started to perform wth more quality and consistency while on loan in Spain the problems with bringing him back to WHL are twofold: firstly, there remain serious concerns about his ability to cope with Premier League physicality; secondly, the guy feels slighted by the club after being brought in at a young age and not really being given a proper opportunity (much as did similar youngsters Boateng and Taraabt) and doesn't really want to come back.

I'm right with you; if it's possible I'd bring him back, reintegrate him with the first team and give him a season to make an impression as back-up to Lennon - we have plenty of games and with proper rotation he could get 20+ starts from there if he does well (though we might need to bring in someone to teach Redknapp about proper rotation first). He's a more mature and experienced player now and that could make all the difference.

Don't see it happening at this point though. Shame really, as I imagine he'll likely go on to make a big impression somewhere else (again, much like promising youngsters Boateng and, to a certain extent, Taraabt).

true,GoldenBoar,null,null,"&gt;They retain their lack of respect and inbuilt sense of entitlement.

I was selling drugs at the age of 12 on the streets of Merseyside and basically grew up in a gang culture. I commited many crimes in my youth. I'm in my thirties now but if these riots would have taken place when I was a teenager, I would have been part of them and would have looted as well. These days, I fix computers and program them but the vast majority of people I know are criminals.

I can tell you with 100% certainly that my behaviour had nothing to do with a sense of entitlement and everything to do with not giving a shit. I did and still do have a lack of respect for many things though, and rightly so. If you don't respect me then why should I respect you? Why should I respect a government that closed down the majority of youth centres and didn't provide any alternatives? Why should I respect people who repeatedly call me a ""scumbag"" without knowing anything about me? Very few people are actually worthy of my respect.

I didn't act the way I did because I was not intelligent. I passed my GCSE's with flying colours and I took all my exams while stoned. I've actually been programming since I was 7. I didn't steal stuff because I thought I was entitled to it and there wouldn't be consequences. I stole stuff because I didn't give a shit about the cosequences. What could the police do? Send me to prison? I was already living in a prison.

I hear that retarded ""sense of entitlement"" phrase all the time and it's always from people who have no idea what they're talking about. What is it you believe we think we are entilted to?

Am I entitled to claim benefits? Yes, so are you.
Am I entitled to an education? Yes, so are you.
Am I entitled to be treated like a human being? Yes, so are you.

I can only speak for my family and other Americans that I know, but a vast majority are either first or second generation citizens.  Personally, it's hard to own to relate to that part of U.S. history, and I think this is probably true for most recent immigrants, because many of us lack that history as part of our personal history.

What I'm trying to say, badly, is that while there is a racist culture in America (and in many countries - and a sentiment that is definitely rising in Europe with the rise of right-wing and nationalist parties), it's not necessarily something that is intrinsic to many citizens.  It is largely a country of immigrants, and perhaps the reason that race is such a prominent/sensitive issue in the country is that the U.S. has such a close history with institutionalised racism.  So to counter that, the government and social structures have tried to make an effort to acknowledge and 'celebrate' (not really effectively) the distinct cultures present in the country - which in the end continues to make race a large factor in the society.  Honestly it confuses me.  Not to say that there aren't loads of close minded assholes that spout vitriol.

A world where people are appointed according to ability as opposed to votes.

Anyway, without getting into my fringe political views, when it comes to the lower class, I would say it's better to say it's self inflicted. Why? Well... it comes down to ""Agency"", the sense of control over ones actions and destiny. To have a strong sense of agency tends to lead individuals to be more successful and more in control. The lower class, in general, do not have a great sense of agency or motivation. If we allow them to believe it isn't self inflicted, they will further lose a sense of agency and increase a sense of entitlement. They will become futher entrenched in their world.

I don't hate the lower class, oh no, far from it. I have a place for my lower class roots and I am not ashamed to tell people. But I do know the culture better than the average born and bred middle class individuals I meet in University, work and on Reddit.

I enjoy watching older TV shows so it's no problem for me, and I adore the cheesy effects they used, especially in the 60s and 70s. But not everyone likes that, and not everyone wants to watch things with the slower pacing, or whatever reason they don't like the older serials of Doctor Who.

I feel like it's definitely enriching my DW experience, and I can't help but think that people who won't watch those are missing out, but if you don't like it, you shouldn't have to sit through hours and hours of it.

But that won't stop me teasing you about it. :P

Star Wars, Star Trek, all science fiction with a legacy that is decades old will have these issues, but you can still appreciate Star Wars even if you don't read all the books and do everything in the expanded universe.

Just list them, no need for copies of the evidence. If the employer wants to see the credentials they'll ask. Probably a good idea to have the credentials in a folder somewhere, as a three-week delay if they ask isn't going to look great. Been a while since I did a CV, but I used to put it in the format of a short table: dates down the left, place employed, role (you can either put job title, or brief description of responsibilities).

Closest thing to credentials, which you *should* include, is a couple of references. (Apologies if you know this already but I'm spelling it out as ""references"" means different things in different contexts): simply name &amp; contact details of (usually two) past bosses, who the prospective employer may contact to ask about you. Make sure you're clear where they work &amp; what their relationship to you was. (If you're at an early stage in your career &amp; don't have two work references, substitute with other responsible people, e.g. university tutor, headmaster, lots of options).

I'd strongly suggest you quickly phone the people you're going to use as references: remind them of your existence &amp; what a nice responsible person you are, &amp; politely ask if you can use them as references. This is best done sober. In UK an ex-employer is actually obliged by some law or other (citation *definitely* missing here) to confirm your employment with them to a prospective employer, but it doesn't have to be a favourable reference as long as they don't tell lies about you... which is why I recommend the diplomatic option, and never burning bridges with employers no matter how they dick you about.

An opinion for what it's worth: a lot of people will tell you that there's some sort of ""standard"" format for a CV: in fact, in the UK at least, there are a lot of different approaches used. Be a bit wary of templates you find online, as most are American and the British (while probably moving in that direction) tend to be a little more formal, for instance I would never use an introductory statement full of management-speak bullshit (""My name is Chas, I'm a dynamic, goal-focussed team player..."") in fact if I were recruiting I would probably invite Chas for interview just so I could tell him to fuck off.

Just keep it brief (I'd say two pages, three if it's a technical job &amp; you've got lots of relevant experience), check spelling &amp; grammar - careful spellcheck might be American, get a (literate) Brit friend to look it over if you're worried - and if the hobbies &amp; interests section is more than a couple of brief sentences, you'll not get the job.

true,Torquemada1970,english,Slurrey,"&gt;There is a major difference between how you and I approach the antithesis of our views, asking you questions is the only way for me to understand your beliefs and in the process test my own for error. I gather you interpret this as some sort of weakness or cop-out, is this correct?

If you'd been asking questions, this may have been possible - but instead, you were making assumptions and putting words into my mouth. Not the same thing. And blaming the riots on immigration, but then insisting that it has nothing to do with immigrants, without any backup or examples - that's a troll.

&gt;I added to your analogy because it rested on a straw-man

No it didn't. Read again. And you added nothing - just listed some vague summaries of UK history that I would suggest most wouldn't agree with with statements like 'this to the final chapter of English history and culture.' Again, pure troll-ery.

&gt;and for you to understand the views I and others hold do not come from some sort of emotional or irrational predictions but rather observation and historical parallels, expanding on it seemed appropriate.

That's a very long-winded way of saying 'I hijacked your comments with my own agenda'. You didn't ask any questions, and your 'historical obvservations' haven't actually appeared yet. That's three troll points.

&gt;Let me clear up a few things for you: violence does not mean ""riots"" it's dishonest or stupid for you to assume that is a fault of my argument.

Actually, it's neither - we're talking about riots, you asked 'When has diversity not erupted in violence?'. If you were going off on a tagent, you didn't say so, and you can't now insist that you 'meant something else'. Best to check the subject under discussion before hijacking it with your own agenda. Again. Four troll points.

&gt;The word ""mass"" before ""immigration"" leaves little room for interpretation unless of course you are simply trying to derail me into a battle of semantics.

Ah, so if that was what I was doing, why is it acceptable when you've done it already? Five troll points.

&gt;I almost feel bad having to point out that you use an example of the Roman empire then tell me if I were to use any example dating pre-200 years ago it wouldn't be relevant 

Yeah, I can see how it would make you feel bad to concentrate on one aspect of immigration and somehow take that to mean my other race examples are invalid. Six troll points.

&gt;Lastly, Aryans would not let me in their clubs or attend their rallies, 

That's odd, because you come across as quite desperate to be one.

&gt;lol any other blind assumptions?

You don't need any help from me, you've already made more than a few unsubstantiated claims and assumptions of your own, you don't need any help from me. Funny that, again, you're too busy looking for cracks to notice how the majority of your comments aren't backed up in any way.

true,[deleted],null,null,"Old man with a time/space machine called a TARDIS is found in a junkyard by a pair of 1960s school teachers following a mysterious female student home because they are curious about how she lives. Teachers discover she lives in the TARDIS with an old man called the Doctor that the girl calls Grandfather. Male teacher baits old man into operating aforementioned TARDIS. Old man seemingly cannot control where the machine goes. Many adventures ensue, and the Doctor meets and defeats the Daleks a few times. Eventually Susan, the Doctor's granddaughter, decides to stay on earth in the 22nd century. Sometime after that, the teachers find their way home in a Dalek Time machine. The Doctor picks up other companions along the way. Eventually, the First Doctor runs into the Cybermen, and after foiling their plans to take over the earth, complains that his body is wearing out, falls down and turns into a younger, shorter, sillier man who likes to play the recorder. After many adventures and new companions in this form, he is forced to call his own people, the Time Lords, to help clean up after a particularly messy adventure involving the kidnapping of whole armies from different wars on earth so he can get them all home again. The Time Lords put the Doctor on trial for interfering in the events of the universe outside his home planet. They sentence him to exile on earth in the 20th century and cause him to change form again into a more dashing figure with white hair and a penchant for frilly shirts. The Third Doctor gets involved with a military organization called UNIT whose task is to protect earth from aliens and the unknown. Many crises and adventures with UNIT ensue, the Master shows up for the first time and several subsequent times. Eventually the Doctor's exile is lifted after he saves the whole universe from Omega, an ancient and deranged Time Lord stuck in another universe due to an accident. More adventures in time and space are had, Daleks, etc. The Third Doctor is irradiated by energies from blue crystals on Metabelis III and changes form into a goofy looking guy with a mop of curly hair who decides that wearing an 18-foot scarf all the time is a good idea. In this form, the Doctor has piles of adventures, including, but not limited to, going back to the very origins of the Daleks, assembling the Key to Time and accidentally exploring a ""bubble universe"" called E-space or Exo-Space. The Fourth Doctor regenerates when, after a fight with the Master (who has recently stolen a body after he ran out of regenerations), he falls from several hundred feet off of a large satellite dish. Thsi time he takes form as a younger looking blond guy who likes wearing a cricket outfit. In this form, the Doctor is more vulnerable and kind than previously. He keeps a ship full 2-3 companions at all times for most of his fifth life. Adventures and battles are had with the Black Guardian, the Cybermen, Daleks. The Fifth Doctor regenerates due to a disease called spectrox toxemia. He manages to get the antidote to his companion but there is none left for him. It is thought that the disease caused problems for his regeneration because his Sixth self started off very unstable, at one point trying to choke and kill his companion. After some adventures involving the Master, the Rani, HG Wells and his 2nd self, the Sixth Doctor is again put on trial by the Time Lords for interfering. It turns out that the trial is a sham and an evil version of his future self, the Valeyard, is after his life force. The Valeyard is defeated. The Doctor and his companion leave....?????..... The Rani attacks the TARDIS, forcing it to land and when it does, the Doctor regenerates into small, Scottish sounding man. The Seventh Doctor is at first kind of silly and bumbling but soon becomes calculating and manipulative (though he does so for the greater good, usually). Again, adventures are had involving the Daleks, the Cybermen, Gallifreyan technology from the Old Time, etc. Eventually the Doctor is tasked with taking the Master's remains back to Gallifrey. The Master's life force is apparently not completely dormant and the TARDIS is forced down on Earth in the 90s. The Seventh Doctor is shot in the head by gang members in LA and regenerates into his 8th self in a hospital morgue. The TVM is awful so I'm stopping here.

My other brother went to Uni, got his business degree, went to London, became a manager in a govt department relocated again, did the same. I didn't bother going to Uni but did a HND instead. I have my own IT business, own two houses and am quite happy. A friend of mine who grew up in similar circumstances has 3 businesses - an amusement arcade, a container storage yard and a PMR radio comms business. Many of the people I grew up with were the same. One guy went into the RAF as an officer and became a pilot and now is a flying instructor. One became a GP. A few set up in the building trade, one has a landscape gardening firm, one is a roofer and one has a gas fitting/plumbing firm with 4 employees. Most people I went to school with have left the town because of the lack of opportunity or have set up their own businesses. The rest are sat at home on the dole whinging how its everyones fault they are in the boat they are in.

My wife left school with no qualifications - came from a family where nobody has worked for two generations and live in council houses scrounging off the state - her sister at the age of 39 has only ever worked 8 weeks in her entire life. Despite leaving school with no qualifications, apart from a short period when she had the kids, she has worked since she left school over 20 years ago. She is now the manager of a company that makes signs, having worked up from the shop floor joining as a trainee, doing everything from design with CAD and Adobe software through to manufacture involving printing on various materials, screen printing including making the screens, metal fabrication, working with plastics and joinery.

It has fuck all to do with your name, where you are from or any of that bullshit and everything to do with how motivated you are to better yourself which comes down to accepting personal responsibility. My brothers and I could have quite easily sat there on the dole complaining how life was unfair and we never got the breaks those with money did. But instead we grafted our arses off, worked 60+hr weeks and bettered ourselves. And we managed that despite living through the recession of the 80's, the decimation of our area (so poor it qualifies for economic assistance from the EU) by the closure of the mines/steel industry in West/South Yorks, the recession of the 1990's and the recent one. 

All of these fucks whinging and whining about how they have no money and got no education because the school was crap are blaming everyone else except themselves. They had the same opportunities to learn as my brothers and I - I would go as far as saying that they had better as I went to school when Maggie was raping the education system and not when it had record funding. They had the same opportunities to move to find work or create their own jobs if there aren't any as we did. But no, lets sit there and bitch and whine instead. Fuck em. Fuck everything about their lazy sorry arses.",0,1313054769,null,0,true,0,c2bo31x,t3_jeyww,t1_c2bo31x,t1_c2bllfb,1427457829,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

true,jazimov,eng-nottinghamshire,Nottingham,"It isn't about money, its about a sense of power and the feeling that you can do what you want no matter what constraints society normally places upon you. Destruction of others work without care, without a sense of moral duty is the ultimate feeling of control because its like saying ""I'm not bound by the rules that others are"".

There is more to the financial value of the objects destroyed in the riots, for example, a furniture shop that has been in a man's family for 5 generations was burned down for no good reason.

Likewise the bullingdon club asserted (and continue to assert) their destruction on others property. In recent years, for example, they were outcast by the uni because they smashed all the stain glass windows that were hundreds of years old and left a blank check in exchange. A blank check won't bring back history but I'm guessing the feeling of power the members of the bulingdon club felt when they did this was probably worth it to them.

Everything you can say about the rioters you can balance out against Johnson, Osbourne and Cameron when they were in that age:

A lot of people are saying the rioters are coasting on benefits. Well the bullingdon club have never had to work an honest day in their life, everything was paid for by their parents.

""The rioters are drug dealers"", I'm guess small time, just like a certain prime minister was. 

I don't mean to say that  Cameron, Osbourne and Johnson are the same as the rioters, but if you look at the reasons for being in the bullingdon club, and the reason why kids join gangs and go around rioting if you strip away wealth from the equation you're not too far off.

&gt;WHEN short-sighted pensioner Alf Spence tottered down to his local postbox to send a card, he hoped he hadn’t missed the last collection.
&gt;
&gt;But as he popped the envelope through the little slot a concerned passerby looked at him with a stunned expression.
&gt;
&gt;The Good Samaritan tapped befuddled Alf, 91, on the shoulder and explained to him that he wasn’t stood in front of a postbox but had in fact posted his great-grandson’s birthday card into a council DOG POO waste bin!
&gt;
&gt;**STEAMING**
&gt;
&gt;Partially-blind Alf, of Bedale, North Yorks, is now facing up to the fact he’s been “posting” his letters, cards and competition entries into a box of steaming pooch turd for the past TWO YEARS! The World War II veteran, who was part of the ill-fated Dieppe Raid in 1942, told Sunday Sport: “I walked down to the postbox, like I do every week, and began placing our Tommy’s third birthday card in the little slot.
&gt;
&gt;“A woman walking her dog came up to me, tapped me on the shoulder, and asked what I was doing.
&gt;
&gt;“I thought she was going to cry when I told her. She held my hand and pointed out that the postbox was on the other side of the road.
&gt;
&gt;“I’ve not got the best eyesight these days but even so, the postbox and the dog dirt box are almost identical. They’re both red, the same shape and stuck on a post.
&gt;
&gt;“I bet I’m not the only pensioner to get confused. The bloody council should never have put them so close together.”
&gt;
&gt;Alf has since contacted Royal Mail telling them to cancel their investigation into the hundreds of missing letters and parcels he’s sent over the last two years.
&gt;
&gt;The widower, who lost his wife Betsie to the sea in 1989, said: “I accused them of losing my post, saying their service was rubbish. I now owe them an apology.”
&gt;
&gt;Alf ’s daughter Susan May, 59, told Sunday Sport she was relieved the riddle of the missing letters had finally been solved.
&gt;
&gt;The mum of four, from Luton, Beds, said: “Every time I asked dad if he’d remembered one of kids’ birthdays, he’d say, ‘Yes, there’s a cheque in the post’.
&gt;
&gt;“When they never showed up we thought he was either losing his marbles or was just plain lying. “So it’s nice to know he was at least trying, bless him.”
&gt;
&gt;**EMPTY**
&gt;
&gt;She added: “What I’d like to know is why the people who empty the dog poo box have never wondered why Dad’s letters are in there.
&gt;
&gt;“Surely they could have passed them on to Royal Mail or forwarded them on to the addressees with a letter saying where they were found?”
&gt;
&gt;A source at North Yorkshire District Council confirmed they had erected the red dog waste bins in June 2009 –– around the time when Alf’s mail started mysteriously ‘disappearing’

true,The3rdWorld,eng-essex,Essex,"that's simply not true about the political antipodes, yes the torys want to dismantle many aspects of the nanny state -tending to be the ones which stop rich people screwing everyone else- but they're in many places directly opposing aspects of the left trying to dismantle sections of it which may affect their profit margins.  
  
Case in point; cannabis - i *could* grow my weed exactly the same way i grow my tomato's and save myself massive amounts of money however for absolutely no good reason both political parties block this - why?  Endless scientific and sociological advisor's have suggested legalization but they tend to get sacked for saying it rather then their opinions being listened to -they even tried it in one of Londons more brutal areas no doubt expecting it to go wrong but in fact it didn't so they quietly stopped it and ignored it...  Things like this are seen by many people as a direct disconnect between the type of society we pretend to have (free, democratic, fair, friendly) and their daily lives.  
  
The problems also come as an example which can be repeated a billion times from the high cost of music licences and that sort of thing, they push business ownership out of the small guys hands - how many of your favourite pubs are owned by a chain now?  ALL the indy or semi-indy pubs i've ever been a local at closed down or and got bought out despite being massively popular - when a pub that's standing room only EVERY night can't afford to survive then doesn't that say something about the costs being applied to that?  and it's not the cost of beer it's the cost of licencing and et cetera - all the little things are made impossible by red tape and exorbitant shenanigans from some form of government or corporation or something.  These things coupled with the breaks and leniency given to big companies is exactly why when you walk into any high street in the country it's exactly the same shops and exactly the same chain pubs - it's not even the fault of the mulleted giants of awful chain-pubs it's simply the way our society is stacked and it's fucking a lot of people over.  
  
While it IS many issues of the nanny state which are the problem we can't simply say that it's only the nanny state which is the problem or that some aspects of it aren't important and useful - same goes for our economic system, our social system and our systems system.

What were they doing in the road? If I were a 32 year old black man  there is no fucking way I would be stopping in that neighbourhood with damn near 100 (probably armed) asians surrounding me. I like being alive.

As for the driver, I doubt he was looting the area from his car. I'm also pretty sure if he was white no-one would be as quick to call him a murderer. I think the murder charge will dropped and was only raised to try and keep a lid on the muslims.

&gt;If its minimum wage but only say 26hours a week you are no better off.

Yes you would, you'd be about £5 better off and you'd probably be eligible for certain benefits as well.

&gt;Or if there are some weeks where they dont need you you are totally screwed.

I'm not sure, but I don't believe it works like that. It's exactly the same as full-time work except that you work less hours. If they didn't want you to come in and work then they'd probably still have to pay you unless it's in your employment contract. What your describing sounds more like agency work to me.

&gt;And all of this is without considering things like travel costs and childcare which quickly cut into what you earn...

Lets take a look shall we. We have a family, mum, dad and 3 kids. 2 of those kids are in school and the yougest is 1 year old. Both parents work 26 hours a week for minimum wage, with a household income of £15734.72, and spend £175 a week on child care. This family is entitled to £10078.61 in Tax Credits, with £551.02 being Working Tax Credit and the rest Child Tax Credit. See the [HMRC Tax Credit calculator](http://taxcredits.hmrc.gov.uk/Qualify/DIQHousehold.aspx) to do your own calculation.

Like I said, ""better off on the dole"" is nonsense.

Dominant: Clapham, hands down. Central London based team. On for their 10th or 11th Nationals title. Had a few of the big players from the US play with them when they've been in London over the years. Adam Holt, Alex Nord, Damien Scott (I remember playing with him and he fucking point blocked a hammer and caught it - HA), the list goes on.

Behind them you have two teams who on their days can beat each other, but quite often fall short of Clapham. Chevron Action Flash (or Chevy) who are a Northern team. Used to be a phone team, got quite a few awesome players. And Fire of London, another London-based team; 4/5 years ago they were up there, still floating around 2nd/3rd in country. Rivalries between Clapham-Fire and Clapham-Chevy.

Just behind these three are Brighton, who have some incredible players, but none really take it seriously. Still they're guys that don't do warm-downs, smoke joints between matches, know the rules to the letter, etc. But are consistently in the top 5 of the UK. These guys had a big rivalry with a now defunct team, Fully-Charged. These guys were a young lot, broke away from Fire and had one good season and then faded away. Fairly opposite of Brighton; liked physicality in the game, disc spikes, intensity, etc. Badly spirited for the UK scene; but probably would have fit in with the American scene (albeit a lot shitter).

As for the college scene; it's a long way behind that of America. Many university teams see it as a chance to do a bit of sport whilst getting drunk and playing silly games. It's rare for you to get athletic types getting involved in Ultimate in UK universities, unless they got recruited at high school (getting more prevalent) or they're at a sports-university. Certainly when I was captain of my uni team, this was the biggest battle. Many people coming to play it because they wanted to keep fit socially but weren't athletic or sporty to play the major sports; i.e. soccer, netball, rugby. Hard to get people competitive and intense at university level. Those universities that do tend to dominate; Sussex, Portsmouth, Warwick and St Andrews are the main ones over the last few years to have done well. Problem with this obviously is that these players who want to be competitive go to club teams, leaving their uni teams and then the cycle continues.

Just my own opinion but I also feel the idea of spirit within UK universities is really skewed. I think many see it as having a laugh, not getting too serious or intense. Certainly any teams that do are immediately labelled as bastards and unspirited. This is also on personal experience; from both sides.

It's all these for every single person in this country, and all you need to be successful is to put in some effort - these people never did!

Maybe their schools were sub-standard but that's because most of the people in them don't even want to learn. The students make a school sub-standard far more than the teachers and location. I've read some posts around here from people who went to the same schools as many of these looters, and they said how only a very small number of students went on to university - but they *could*. And *they* did. They had every opportunity to, but the majority of them just simply didn't give a shit about their education. They had teachers, textbooks, and everything they needed and they squandered the whole fucking lot of it.

The reason ""it's never theirs"" is because they've never done a damned thing to earn it! They don't have a job because they threw away their education and aren't willing to work the jobs that people with no education can do. ""There's no jobs"" is a phrase uttered most by people who apply for the least jobs - they want jobs handed to them on a silver platter... well sorry, it doesn't work like that.

And these small businesses they are destroying are the people who did put in the effort, people who are willing to put in 12 hours of work every day to acheive something with their lives. Utterly reprehensible.

The main distinguishing factor between these looters is not the colour of the skin or where they live - it's that they are all thick as pig shit, and *is it entirely their own fault*.

Also, this ""respect"" bullshit has got to end - it's just another self-entitlement some people feel is their right. No. You *give* respect first before you even **dare** to ask for it. Respect isn't free, you earn it, and if you act in ways deserving of it, you *will* get it. These people who don't get respect are always the people who don't deserve it, every time, without fail.

&gt;Gaddafi executed dissidents publicly and the executions were often rebroadcast on state television channels. Gaddafi employed his network of diplomats and recruits to assassinate dozens of critical refugees around the world. Amnesty International listed at least 25 assassinations between 1980 and 1987.

[Source](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya#Libya_under_Colonel_Muammar_al-Gaddafi_1969.E2.80.93present)

He got away with a lot of things other states have been invaded for because he was seen as a useful ally and stabilising force in the area, but the recent uprisings throughout the middle-east changed everything.

The [timeline of relations between Libya and the UK](http://uk.reuters.com/article/2011/07/27/uk-britain-libya-relations-idUKTRE76Q31F20110727) really shows the rather turbulent &amp; at times slightly schizophrenic relationship.

&gt;Critics claim that British economic interests in Libya had muted support for the uprising there. British exports to Libya have risen to more than £400m and are set to increase dramatically as oil and gas investments by Shell and BP develop. Britain halted military exports to Libya last week but sniper rifles, which may have killed protesters yesterday, were amongst equipment exported to Tripoli last year.

I agree, it's one of the many irritating anachronisms of our houses of parliament.

The ""Does the PM agree..."" questions are because in PM's Questions, the only interventions that are allowed (other than Points of Order) are in the form of questions to the PM. The Speaker (who, you'll have gathered by now, is the referee geezer in the middle, not the MP speaking, even though he *is* actually an MP...) attempts to give a fair number of ""questions"" to all the represented parties....

...bear in mind the whole damn charade is a political dick-swinging contest, and not in any way an attempt to discuss and resolve issues, or receive answers to genuinely motivated questions: because it takes the format of ""questions only"", for the government's side to get it's arguments across, when it's their turn for a question they tend to ask the ""Does the PM agree with me that...[the sky is blue, the sea is wet, and little lambs eat ivy...]"" to give the PM a soft question which he can respond to with some message of his own. In most cases he will have been forwarned of the question, or he (or his staff) will have planted it with a sympathetic MP.

Don't lump them into some sort of catagory to justify their actions, *their background is not an excuse for what they do* and it's insulting to the majority of kids from poorer backgrounds who are hard working and respectful.

In other words, don't downvote just because you don't agree because it makes the conversation ridiculously hard to read when everyone who doesn't cream their pants over cake pictures is below threshold regardless of how polite they were being.

Seriously, of all the subreddits I subscribe to, r/doctorwho is the **worst** at abusing the downvote function.  I regularly *upvote* posts I disagree with on here if they've received undeserved downvotes.

**EDIT:** Case in point, I am being downvotes for pointing out something fairly politely (if you ignore the tiny cake jab) despite the fact that I am reasonably contributing to the discussion at hand.  That is blatant abuse of the voting system.  If you disagree with me, don't upvote me, but if you do not, there is no reason to downvote me.  Except now I'm going to get more downvotes out of spite.  Good thing karma is just a number on a website, huh?

**EDIT2:** Possibly the confusion comes from links and self.posts versus comments.

Finally, I personally totally agree about small business owners, but others have pointed out on other fora that there may be local issues we're unaware of, and that given their levels of anger, they're probably not discriminating too well between those who genuinely deserve it, or who appear to be condoning society's abnegation of their responsibilities towards them, foreign wars, corruption, police brutality etc. etc., and those who aren't part of the problem.",0,1313079120,null,0,true,0,c2bq09w,t3_jflw2,t1_c2bq09w,t1_c2bop9u,1427458736,-1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,-1

Makes sense in a Van Gogh episode. He was an absinthe drinker himself, painted a number of absinthe-related paintings, and it's rumored absinthe was involved when he famously cut off his ear, which led to [this great advertising image](http://facweb.cs.depaul.edu/sgrais/images/Green/LaFee_VanGogh_800x600.jpg) by La Fee.

Footnote:

Also, as an FYI, absinthe is *not* hallucinatory and it isn't set on fire when you prepare it. The first myth sprung from some shadier producers artificially coloring it with lead and other metals and folks who were on all kinds of other things *as well as* absinthe, and the second becam a fad when the drink was re-popularized in the Netherlands and Czech Republic years back. It was historically banned in various countries more for political reasons than anything, and is now fully legal in the US after a distiller/scientist proved to the FDA that the psychotropic chemical, thujone, that's in wormwood is almost completely eliminated during distillation.

Look at it this way. A man commits a crime and no one stops him...possible outcome, he commits the crime again. Same guy commits crime, this time cops catch him...outcome, he's stopped from committing more crimes, even if temporarily. This is as simple as people see the situation.

Now we have another guy, he's not committed a crime but he's being gobby and rude during a routine traffic stop. The cop grabs him, slams him on the bonnet and takes him in for a night in the cells. No one is around...possible outcome, the guy thinks better of being a mouthy prat the next time he encounters a policeman. Same guy, same scenario, but this time we're in the middle of Brixton and the guy is black...possible outcome, the already hostile crowd filming on their mobile phones start booing and shouting and getting worked up at the heavy handedness.

I'm afraid the reality is that parliamentary procedure turns a lot of people away from mainstream politics. I can remember listening to it on the radio in my dad's car when I was a kid (it wasn't even on the TV in those days) and finding the whole thing nauseatingly childish, with the ""hear, hear"" and general bluster and feigned outrage at everything the other side said... I can clearly remember finding it alienating and ridiculous. That was when I was of the age when setting fire to my own farts was pretty much the highlight of my CV. 

(Still is, now I come to think about it.)

As you get older, these things become an accepted part of the background noise, and parliament somehow seems less ludicrous. I'm quite sure there isn't a perfect setup for a democratic institution anywhere in the world; ours isn't the worst by a long way, but personally I find the façade of Respectability ridiculous, especially in the light of the last few years.

The guy then moves closer to the person being searched for whatever reason, and it's then that the cop stops him moving any closer by putting his hand out to stop him.  Yes, the cop is allowed to do this.  He's not stopping the guy filming, he's keeping him at a distance from the guy being searched by putting his hand on his shoulder.

The guy with the camera is flipping out, mouthing off and shouting simply because the cop put his hand on his shoulder.  Once the camera guy has backed away from the search, the cop then leave's the camera guy alone, now that he's back where he started, several meters away.

Then at about 1:25, the camera guy tries to shove past a different cop (why would you do this?!) who is just standing there the whole time, saying ""move out the way man, go on try and grab me and search me"", then he gets his wish and is searched.

Just like showing the angels moving made them less scary, showing the faces of the silence made them much less scary as well. The only moment of the series when I felt truly scared of the silence was [the moment when Amy was moving through the dark house with her flashlight, she looked down, and her hand was suddenly glowing orange. I really wish they would have engineered that episode so that the audience never sees the moments where they confront the silence.

I think that when 'apologists' speak of social problems they are pointing out an imbalance it is an indictment of the present system not a group. I actually find it pretty crap when thatcherites and conservatives in general try to pull a fast one and claim that *everybody* has the same opportunities (read ""responsibility"") which is obviously bullshit that is convenient for them and their interests. That is why it strikes me as strange when people with your experience seem to state the same kind of thing.

&gt;Old man with a time/space machine called a TARDIS is found in a junkyard by a pair of 1960s school teachers following a mysterious female student home because they are curious about how she lives. Teachers discover she lives in the TARDIS with an old man called the Doctor that the girl calls Grandfather. Male teacher baits old man into operating aforementioned TARDIS. Old man seemingly cannot control where the machine goes. Many adventures ensue, and the Doctor meets and defeats the Daleks a few times. Eventually Susan, the Doctor's granddaughter, decides to stay on earth in the 22nd century. Sometime after that, the teachers find their way home in a Dalek Time machine. The Doctor picks up other companions along the way. Eventually, the First Doctor runs into the Cybermen, and after foiling their plans to take over the earth, complains that his body is wearing out, falls down and turns into a younger, shorter, sillier man who likes to play the recorder. 

&gt;After many adventures and new companions in this form, he is forced to call his own people, the Time Lords, to help clean up after a particularly messy adventure involving the kidnapping of whole armies from different wars on earth so he can get them all home again. The Time Lords put the Doctor on trial for interfering in the events of the universe outside his home planet. They sentence him to exile on earth in the 20th century and cause him to change form again into a more dashing figure with white hair and a penchant for frilly shirts. 

&gt;The Third Doctor gets involved with a military organization called UNIT whose task is to protect earth from aliens and the unknown. Many crises and adventures with UNIT ensue, the Master shows up for the first time and several subsequent times. Eventually the Doctor's exile is lifted after he saves the whole universe from Omega, an ancient and deranged Time Lord stuck in another universe due to an accident. More adventures in time and space are had, Daleks, etc. The Third Doctor is irradiated by energies from blue crystals on Metabelis III and changes form into a goofy looking guy with a mop of curly hair who decides that wearing an 18-foot scarf all the time is a good idea. 

&gt;In this form, the Doctor has piles of adventures, including, but not limited to, going back to the very origins of the Daleks, assembling the Key to Time and accidentally exploring a ""bubble universe"" called E-space or Exo-Space. The Fourth Doctor regenerates when, after a fight with the Master (who has recently stolen a body after he ran out of regenerations), he falls from several hundred feet off of a large satellite dish. Thsi time he takes form as a younger looking blond guy who likes wearing a cricket outfit. 

&gt;In this form, the Doctor is more vulnerable and kind than previously. He keeps a ship full 2-3 companions at all times for most of his fifth life. Adventures and battles are had with the Black Guardian, the Cybermen, Daleks. The Fifth Doctor regenerates due to a disease called spectrox toxemia. He manages to get the antidote to his companion but there is none left for him. It is thought that the disease caused problems for his regeneration because his Sixth self started off very unstable, at one point trying to choke and kill his companion. After some adventures involving the Master, the Rani, HG Wells and his 2nd self, the Sixth Doctor is again put on trial by the Time Lords for interfering. It turns out that the trial is a sham and an evil version of his future self, the Valeyard, is after his life force. The Valeyard is defeated. The Doctor and his companion leave....?????..... The Rani attacks the TARDIS, forcing it to land and when it does, the Doctor regenerates into small, Scottish sounding man. 

&gt;The Seventh Doctor is at first kind of silly and bumbling but soon becomes calculating and manipulative (though he does so for the greater good, usually). Again, adventures are had involving the Daleks, the Cybermen, Gallifreyan technology from the Old Time, etc. Eventually the Doctor is tasked with taking the Master's remains back to Gallifrey. The Master's life force is apparently not completely dormant and the TARDIS is forced down on Earth in the 90s. The Seventh Doctor is shot in the head by gang members in LA and regenerates into his 8th self in a hospital morgue.

Obviously this is my own personal opinion, but really when it comes to many situations society at large is given a say. There are many cases where you could say ""It's not up to you"" and yet there are rules in place. For example, how someone raises their child is generally left up to them. But our society demands that the child is education to a certain degree.

&gt; but it isn't our place to say. 

So whose place is it to say? I don't think you're going to hear that much from an oppressed group, particularly when they're not allowed to speak up.

&gt; We can't generalise what people should or shouldn't do; it all comes down to personal choice.

My point here is that these women are often not given a choice as such - at least not really. That's not me assuming: that's me listening to women (and men) who are outspoken about the Muslim community.

I'm not saying we need to do something directly. More indirect, like the faith school example thus avoiding the segregation of children. The only problem I have is that this is the only example I can think of. Hence coming to reddit.

Agger is obviously the most gifted footballer in the group but he is not good enough in the air to be a number one and his injuries and long recovery time make him unreliable.  Soto is a backup at best.  Martin Kelly, Danny Wilson, Andre Wisdom and Stephen Sama are not ready, full stop.  Conor Coady is sometimes mentioned as a CB and his size, strength and toughness are unquestionable but I have never seen him play in defense so I have no idea.  To the question though, I really like Scott Dann.  I know he is slow but Jesus, so is Hyypia and he is the best defender Liverpool have had in my lifetime.  Gary Cahill is good, maybe even great but I would still like to see him partnered with someone like Dann who is taller and incredible in the air.

Man U being the main challenger, we'll need to take points from them. Sunderland away. Stoke in the rain. 4. We need a creative mid to replace Silva when he's injured/resting. Nasri or de Rossi have been rumored and would be great additions. I'd prefer de Rossi personally, he might gel with Mancini more being Italian and Nasri has been injury prone.

If the person filming it didn't get all arsey then there would have been no problem.

Do not think that it is young yoots that are stopped. Regular photographers were having their memory cards taken from camera's in public places when the terror alerts were high. 

It's strange that you would be uncomfortable with the complete police force, it's his decision if he wants to be filmed or not.

true,The3rdWorld,eng-essex,Essex,"people are going to forgive the libdems tuition fees, history is already proving that their are far more epic problems, more epic even than the fact our entire economy is currently falling down.
  
At some point the debate on economies, civil unrest and et cetera will prove the point that this corporate profit hunting eternal growth expecting delusion is actually a form of mania - we as a political debate will change face, rather than looking west into the setting sun we'll turn to the rising sun, the ideology of empire will officially die soon (possibly with the news china becomes #1 economy over our kid america and the old jewel india's space program and social mobility is eclipsing our own) because we know we can't take over the middle east and live off their oil profits, we know we can't forever con the world with out clever banking tricks. we know we can't all live like millionsairs even if we want to be a billionair so freaking badly.  
  
Not just the biggest three news stories of the year convey this perfectly but so do al the little indicators.  Murdoc fallen from grace, we see the ugly face of corporate media.  London on fire, we see the ugly face of social repression.  The economy collapsed (again), we see the ugly face of trying to do magic with money.  These things are the stalwart base of both New Labour and old Tory ideology, it's the new deal and big society; it's public private partnerships and firesale sell offs - when these phony ideas are finally trashed then the debate will be between the libdems and the greens, hopefully with the greens ahead.  
  
And i'm not talking about planting trees in your turn ups, the modern green party is actually much more respectable than you may imagine - they have solid fiscal policy which doesn't rely on eternal growth, they have systemic solutions to sociological problems and workable initiatives to increase our average standard of living without ruining anyone else's.

The original *Star Trek* had ridiculous planet sets and foam rocks, and nearly all space ships prior to *2001* were an obvious joke.

But I have a suggestion which might help: think about seeing a play.  If you go see a stage play, people will ""go for a drive"" by just standing on the stage while one holds a steering wheel and turns it side to side.  I have seen plays on bare stages, with just sheets hanging down from the ceiling, and maybe a single chair or something.  In a feature film, someone's ""palace"" being a bunch of sheets with a chair would make no sense at all, and ""driving"" by standing in your living room turning a disembodied steering wheel would be even more ridiculous.  But if you were watching a televised version of a stage play, you'd accept those things without question.

So, if you think of old science fiction movies and TV shows (*Doctor Who*, *Star Trek*, whatever) as a televised version of a stage play, you might find that the cheesy effects don't matter anymore.

But to now pretend that the vast majority are not covered by the words of this article, to suggest that the extreme examples of employed and well off people somehow are more representative of the sort of people who were doing the most damage than the underclass described is just madness.

For example, none of this ""City is looking to win"", it's City *are* looking to win. That's my biggest sticking point with American reporters, even above the 'soccer' thing. Anyway:

1. City can win, but they won't and that's why I love them.

2. Kompany, De Jong, Lescott, Silva, Yaya and Dzeko. The first three need to stay tight unlike in the charity shield. The next two need to combine better in midfield and Dzeko just needs to do what he all know he can do.

3. Toughest opponents, bar the slightly shittier scousers, are top 4 teams away from home. I've watched so many games where the players have just given up on any sort of shape or any idea of retaining possession. It makes me angry that the ball is constantly given away needlessly either through idiotic clearances or sloppy play in the middle of the park. We need to cut out the ridiculous tackling too, referees love to give us cards.

4. We've our back up goalie, centre back and left back, so the most glaring omissions are attacking midfield where we're most likely getting Nasri tomorrow, although I wouldn't mind Christian Eriksson-esque player to step in to Yaya's place against stubborn teams.

2. Silva, same as last season. Hopefully Mancini will give him more control over play, because I think he's absolutely brilliant when it comes to sculpting play. Kompany will also be very important. Probably our most consistent player (even after last game). Johnson is always fun to watch, though he isn't really a leader, and can be very hit-or-miss. Tevez--if he stays by some miracle--will also be very important. But again, he's probably heading out. Which is a shame. Oh, and hopefully Balotelli can keep control of himself. When he isn't being an absolute prick, he's brilliant. But that's a lot to ask from him, it seems.
3. United as always, and for some reason Everton always seem to screw us over. Last season's game against Everton in December really left me with a headache. Still not quite over that one.
4. Nasri, but he's probably on his way. Hopefully we can manage to keep Tevez, but I really doubt it.

Those in charge have repeatedly shown they have no respect for the law and no respect for the populous at large. People are understandably angry. If you can't understand why that blatant hypocrisy would make people angry then... [personal insult redacted]! Many of the people involved couldn't express that thought, or even form it in a coherent manner, but some of them can, and have done so. There are no doubt opportunists, but there are also people with real grievances. I would rather they had gone after ""real"" targets - police stations, institutions of government, the financial district!

(Well, that and the fact that while I have no desire what so ever to see individual people hurt I would like to see some police stations burn!

Of those charged in London half have been under 18, that means half are over 18, and IIRC some have been in their 30s and 40s. 

There is obviously no single reason for people being there, the causes are no doubt complex and contradictory. There is a lot of cognitive dissonance going on on all sides of this.

Not to mention there are lots of people who *definitely* aren't underpriviledged but *still think they are* in their own heads!

You'll notice I never mentioned ""youth"" though, that really isn't the defining demographic although it does seem to have a majority in the younger ages - but a lot of the people in their 20s even are the ones who threw away their education years ago and have been in a rut since.

The very root cause in a lot of ""deprived"" areas just seems to be the perpetual cycle of bad parenting, though - at some point someone was deprived and it just kinda went on. It's not like these people weren't told ""hey if you don't work hard at school you'll never be anything!"" - a lot of people just don't take that seriously, they're too busy being badasses and not giving a crap, then slowly but surely it becomes their reality.

I agree that there are complex problems though, and I don't just attribute *everything* to what I'm saying, but I do believe my points are the major contributing factor to these problems.

By the way, I am totally for changing the way the government works/acts - the entire system, the way politics works, the way the police work, I'm not a fan of capitalism, or the shoddy excuse for democracy we have.

There's simply not enough senior-team roster to do that, and those who might fill in (Bellamy, SWP, Ade) are apparently square pegs in Mancini's, er, round holes. Barry and Milner are relatively slow for their position and seem stressed to play even 1 game a week.  If no cup to vie for OR an injection of 2-3 more players (midfielders and experienced backs) we'll have it in us to be competitive across all fronts.

2. Silva needs to be on top of the ball at all times, he's been a blessing to come ready to play from last year on. Mancio lets him drift into space and he's the universal solvent for good defenses (provided they haven't already scored and parked the bus, see City v Everton Dec 2010). Kompany and DeJ will keep the door shut with huge challenges as long as we've got competent centerbacks to complete (Lescott's finally been improving there). 

Balotelli's going to step up and show what he's made of. With Tevez gone by 2012, he'll have no excuse to fail. Pair him up in front in a 442.

Also, Zabaleta. He's always working hard and his ambidexterity lets him slot in anywhere he's needed. Richards on the opposite wing.

3. Everton, Everton, Everton. Competitive mid-tablers like AVilla and Fulham will threaten, and out of the top 4, Manu and Arsenal. They attack in an unconventional way that catches us off guard and threads past our slower midfield (Nani V City, Feb 2011)

4. Nasri and our target Eriksen from Ajax will be the greatest supplements we could ask for.

I read more about the club and kept getting the sense that LFC and its supporters are really a big family, evidenced by the unity forged through the tragedies of Heysel and Hillsborough, the sense of humor and loyalty of the Kop, and the ""hometown hero"" status of Stevie G and Carragher.
