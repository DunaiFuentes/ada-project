By this I mean the public do not really participate in the decision making process, but are merely sold a party once every 5 years in the manner that they would be marketed any other product. The democratic impulse remains, but the processes and institutions that control power can be accurately described as oligarchical.

The dire quality of the political press, the rise of a self-referential political class and obsessiveness with personality are both more in common with undemocratic dictatorships than a democratic model. (Just compare the level of discourse in papers now with 50 years ago. Remember the population now is far highly educated now than then).

However some of the points in here are ludicrous.

&gt; In effect, he was bowing to pressure from minuscule numbers of influential women – primarily highly paid newspaper columnists and expert pollsters – who have been warning him to speak in a way they consider to be ‘appropriate’. 

This is nothing to do with him being inappropriate, he was extremely rude to a member of his own party and publicly ridiculed her. I imagine this is why he apologised. This stupid comment eclipses the otherwise good observation that the public are rarely invited to have an opinion the most important issues (e.g. the euro crisis) except on platforms like newsnight, the economist or radio 4.

What your saying is that a one parent could use the fact that the other simply owns cert 15/18 movies as a reason to block access, or has access Sky Movies/Film4 on their TV.

&gt; I know, things like political censorship. You just need to look at the list of sites blocked in Australia under the pretence of kiddy porn to realise that mass centralised censorship of something like the internet is a bad thing.

It is a bad thing, if it is done in the same way. If it is done in the same way as mobile broadband on phones is filtered, then that seems to be workable.

&gt; Well this just adds to my point. If now those unable to afford a computer suffer censorship, the problem is only going to increase in severity.

That is largely up to the person providing the network service to deal with. A lot of them already filter stuff at their own volition without these changes being made. And you can get access to unfiltered internet with a PAYG phone if you want. Or view it at a friends house.

Well, from you descriptions you certainly aren't bad off, but politics and democracy in this country is just as much a failure as in the USA, okay perhaps there is the level of inequality and governmental corruption, but it certainly isn't far off. Look at the tory policies which is making the private sector responsible for countless (not for profit) systems in our society. It's only going to get worse while a very few get very rich.  Also I don't eat this whole ""We are in a deep recession, we better work hard  and suck the cocks of bankers"" to get steady again. If we cut funding for some of the most sicken systems, such as the military, arms trade and secret services. We would have enough to manage the country. Its all about a few wanting to play the game and us souls need to play it. Its bullshit.

In fact there should be more protest, there should be more freedom to allow citizens to change the system towards a more positive direction, the only way this will happen is if government becomes more fair, e.g. removal of central power and bringing control closer to our communities, allowing everyone to have a say, thru concise and un-bias education.

So now you have these houses all using their 50mbps to the max which was never the idea.

I asked the guy on the phone why he can't just limit everyone to 5mbps so there's at least a usable service but he said that while the tech is able to do this it probably wouldn't be allowed because of the contract in place. 

So instead of a perfectly usable 5mbps line I have a 50-100 kbps line.

I'm realistic; I know that companies have to make profit and that they have a responsibility to their employees to keep their jobs (who also pay taxes, I'm sure). I also know that they pay a fair amount in taxes already. But come on; If the CEO of the corporation can't even name all of the tax dodges the company has its obviously complete pile of crap.

No one is going to disagree with that, but I haven't seen any evidence of that occurring at the protests.

Unfortunately you've done exactly what so many of the protesters have done. You've used very biased emotive language *suck the cocks of bankers*, already I'm starting to dismiss you as an angry teenager.

We do have a system which allows citizens to alter the system, it's called a parliamentary democracy which all of us can participate in if we choose to. There are plenty of opportunities to affect change at the local level through established procedures. You could rightly argue that these systems privilege the educated and literate, this is something I'm quite happy with as I have no wish to be governed by the ill-educated. I really don't believe that everyone needs a say in every decision or even the majority (we vote on policy not process), at a certain level we have to nominate leaders and allow them to make decisions efficiently.

I've been in business for quite a while now and spent some time doing change management in large companies, what was very clear is that group decision making is a terrible waste of time. Everyone has a right to an opinion but that doesn't mean they're informed or useful. 

If these protests are in aid of a consensual form of anarchic decision making then I'm opposed to them. I'd rather elect yet another middle class university graduate and take my chances with them.

true,TheShader,mcgann,Defeated Cpt. Kirk,"Technically speaking, they never said they blew up the TARDIS specifically to conceive River. That was assumed(like a lot of things were)in the video.

Although, if you look at the whole picture, it becomes a little more obvious why they exploded the TARDIS(At least, I think so). Let's start from the beginning. Remember what lead the TARDIS to little Amelia in the first place, and what made The Doctor bring her along in the TARDIS as an adult? It was the cracks. He was purely interested in the cracks. This is even shown in The Eleventh Hour when Amy asks him why he came back for her, and he has his monitor set to the crack in her wall. He quickly turns it off and says there's no particular reason he brought her along.

Now, what caused the cracks? The exploding TARDIS. So, while this gets a little wibbly wobbly, hang on with me.  If the TARDIS never exploded, it would have never caused the cracks, and The Doctor would have never ran into little Amelia, and brought her along on his journeys later on. So, the likely answer isn't that The Silence blew up the TARDIS to get Amy and Rory to fornicate, but to get them to come along with The Doctor in the first place. So, I guess in a way, yeah it was to get them to fornicate, but not in the way portrayed in this video.

As for exploding the TARDIS and assuming The Doctor would make everything better in the end, I guess a few things can be said. First of all is that they think The Doctor can survive, quite literally, anything. If someone can fix the whole of space, it's him. Secondly, we don't know what exactly their role was, yet. They could have been in the background making sure The Doctor saved the day, we don't know. We do know, however, that they are extremely smart when it comes to manipulating people, so it's not entirely out of the question.

Also, as good as they are at manipulating people, I don't think they're as sophisticated with time as the Daleks were. And, on top of that, remember that breeching the time lock cost Caan his mental stability. To the Silence it was easier to manipulate the time stream in order to create a Time Lord. That's the key, here. The Silence don't seem to be technologically advanced so much as they're great at manipulating people/time. So for the Daleks it would be easier to breech a time lock, but for The Silence it would be easier to just create their own Time Lord.",0,1318365907,null,0,false,0,c2qodwq,t3_l8a8s,t1_c2qodwq,t1_c2qo7xi,1427717718,2,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,2

true,Philomathematics,hartnell,Hartnell,"I posted a reply to the article, but I'll copy/paste it here to further discussion.

There are a lot of really good points in this article, and overall I agree with the final assessment - this past season of Doctor Who has been fantastically executed, but is a very different storytelling style for the show itself. And I agree, there are problems with serializing the plot in the way that Moffat has done. Personally, I'm a huge fan of those one-off episodes and adventures, and having such an omnipresent overarching plot precludes being able to just have fun for a week.

However, I think that what's being brought up as the main problem here is the isolation of casual viewers versus wanting to retain the fans who follow the show each week. Since its comeback in 2005, Doctor Who has gained more popularity and more viewers each year, so in some ways it can afford to demand more attention. So I think it's really a question of is it right for the show to expect a certain following? 

Now, TV shows that do have expectations of audience knowledge tend to be harder for new or casual viewers to get into and demand that new viewers go back to the beginning to understand what's going on. I'm not overly familiar with the genre, but it also seems that these sort of shows tend towards the dramatic end of the spectrum, whereas shows that let their viewers come and go tend towards comedy, especially sit-coms. The former depends on character development and the latter depends on characters maintaining something of a status quo. There are certainly exceptions to this rule, but I'd say it generally works.

So which does Doctor Who want to be? Which should it be? Pretty unarguably, this past season was a lot more based around drama and character development as we followed the increasingly-complicated Pond/Williams family through time and space and in relation to the Doctor. This style seems to be perhaps more in line with Matt Smith's interpretation of the character, too; he's stated on a few occasions that he'll continue to play the character as long as things stay fresh and interesting, and has expressed the desire that even his costume would change over time. The character is not static for him nor for Steven Moffat, but rather it is dynamic.

This is just one take on it, of course, but it is the direction the current writing/acting team seems to be favoring. There are implications, of course, and LokianEule brings up a good point. But like I've said in other places, I think that moving forward, things are in motion for another reset of the show's tone. So season seven could go either way, I feel; it could continue the plots that have been incubating for a while now, or it could step back and let them be woven through the individual stories more freely, if the Doctor is determined to keep running.

true,E_mE,eu,"Berlin, DE","&gt; Unfortunately you've done exactly what so many of the protesters have done. You've used very biased emotive language suck the cocks of bankers, already I'm starting to dismiss you as an angry teenager.

I'm angry because its unfair and its clear you don't want to question these policies. If you do question them, then you are ignored by the politicians who have the power and refuse to listen to people's voices due to their own selfish interests. The current government is repeatedly demonstrating this, along with Labour previously.  Far as I'm concerned the UK parliamentary system is broken.

&gt; We do have a system which allows citizens to alter the system, it's called a parliamentary democracy which all of us can participate in if we choose to.

Show me clear evidence that this happens.. Our democracy isn't fair what so ever, because it implies that 30% can gain power when the resulting 70% want different. I guess an argument for PR would be applicable here, but the Tories watered that one with there AV concession, which isn't true PR, I do wonder what the turn out would of been if true PR was proposed.

Shouldn't we reflect on the evils that have been performed in our name? The list is massive and the propaganda model (Noam Chomsky - Manufacturing consent) clearly demonstrates how a lot of the worlds abuses which are related to our home countries are generally kept quiet. Recently example is Libya and Egypt, UK and most of its allies where supporting the dictators to the very point they realised that they where going to be over frown.  

&gt; I've been in business for quite a while now and spent some time doing change management in large companies, what was very clear is that group decision making is a terrible waste of time. Everyone has a right to an opinion but that doesn't mean they're informed or useful.

So, these decision are influenced by money, which corrupts very quickly. The point is that people should have the right to question or contribute to a decision without bias, if what they state is incorrect then it needs to be demonstrated. Also, in business people like to make decisions quickly because time == money. In a assembly concept, its about taking your time to come up with a good resolution to a genuine problem which possibly affects all.

Also, might we reflect on the list of abuses by big business?

&gt; I'd rather elect yet another middle class university graduate 

Is this possibly because you are a middle class university graduate? So you are already demonstrating bias towards the lower class who might very well be able to demonstrate a better solution. People who want to be leaders generally have a motive, generally ego or benefits over others in society, which in my eyes is wrong as is due to capitalist driven education system (which is becoming more so). More a less creating little workers rather then thinkers. There will obviously always be people who are leaders in there fields of expertise, but that doesn't mean there judgement can't be scrutinised by who it will end up affecting.

&gt; If we let the public decide how resources were spent all hospitals would only have two wards breast cancer and paediatrics, all the people with unfashionable diseases would be left to die.

Again an argument which only applies to mis-informed individuals, currently our hospital system is aimed towards saving/generating money rather then truly allowing its purpose of being.

Leaving people to die, that sounds almost laughable, you really are misjudging doctors and all other medical related professions which aim to help all problem. With the exception of a few nutters, but that can't be classified in this argument since they are mentally ill to our norms of wanting to continually gain self preservation.

I don't have all the answers - I just like to question,  hive consciousness is demonstrating to be far superior compared to an inner circle of leaders who are easily corrupted, especially in our form of society. A good example of an archaic society forming is the formation of the internet, it's allowing the hive mentality to become stronger and has shown to be far fairer then any leaders in history have ever demonstrated.",0,1318367907,null,0,false,0,c2qopkz,t3_l89on,t1_c2qopkz,t1_c2qo4pq,1427717871,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

I am as you quite rightly guessed a privileged, middle class, university educated male. I am well aware of the inherent bias in my views, but have yet to be persuaded that a lack of education is in anyway superior to education.

You are right in your view that democracy isn't fair, life isn't fair. Democratic systems are the best we've come up with so far, and if a better system (which I do not believe consensus based anarchy is) comes along then I'll be ready to switch over.

I think you have a much higher opinion of people than I do, because I think if you really explained to someone why we support dictators and the implications for not supporting them we'd still have overwhelming support for the current policies. Knowing about sweatshop labour has made no real impact on the purchase of cheap clothes. People are well aware of the horrible abuses in Saudi Arabia but they'd rather people they've never met suffer than give up their car.

I went to [SF Tebby](http://sftebbyandson.com/) a couple of times until they decided I needed £700 of welding done to get my car through the MOT. A crappy little motor, but I decided it was worth it. They carried out the work and when I picked it up the mechanic said ""Yeah... it probably won't get through next year.""

I wish I'd actually said to him: ""Then why the f@&amp;k did you not mention that before?""

When I got the car scrapped the following year, the guy who put it up on the back of the lorry had a look at the work they'd done when I mentioned it. He was appalled that it was a 'professional' job and said it showed mistakes that an apprentice should be ashamed of making. So yeah, I'm not bitter about them.

I would recommend MOT2U who operate in the city, as I got a very good Groupon deal. They collected, cleaned inside and out (rapidly, but still), and fluids checked and topped up and returned the car as well as MOTing. They offer more premium services too. Unfortunately since then I got caught up in a spam episode they had, where they emailed thousands of customers hundreds of times. No joke, I got about 300 and all with the customer details in the CC section rather than BCC. I emailed a whole load of customers are MOT2U apparently ignored my correspondence and heard from a good many unhappy customers. So, if you think your car is going to be OK then I recommend them.

This can only apply to people who have enough money to make alternative choices, people who are too poor to make choice, well it doesn't work. The monetary system has a huge bias to the richer in society, meaning there is a very large quantity who don't really have a say in a capitalist system.

* It's highly dependent on free flow of information  and even more reliant on people taking in that information. I see very little evidence that the average person has much interest in anything which they think doesn't directly affect them.

* Many decisions can only be made by experts, so any consensual decision making will always have to hive off and defer to groups of experts. Instantly you've now created a privileged elite.

* Decisions which should be made at a national level get devolved down to a local level which destroys efficiency. 

* Decision making is very slow is it's truly consensual as you need to inform everyone, collate the results and come to an agreement. Basically you get done over by the first competitor who can think quickly.

* I've never heard of a successful anarchist who wasn't in academia. I have a general rule which is don't take advice on how to run a country from people who aren't rich or powerful, they're the people who don't know how to work with systems.

In the Spanish civil was the anarchist brigades were completely outclassed by the fascist troops and much of that was due to the ability to make decisions and act on them quickly. International politics is a constant war with all countries vying for position, I wouldn't want to give up the ability to react swiftly in that environment.

Clubs are very loud and have a lot of flashing lights etc and you have a lot of people in a small space. My son could not go to one because he cannot cope with mirror balls. So if you don't cope well with loud noise and don't like being in crowds then it isn't for you.

If you are a man, you should go wearing smart casual clothes. A suit is too much as is a tie. Jumper is a no-no even if it is -18 outside. Jeans are a bit too dressed down and in some clubs they won't let people in with jeans. Likewise, some clubs don't let people in with trainers or just wearing t-shirts - try to find out if there are any restrictions on what you can wear at the club you are going to. Women, for some reason, seem to be able to get away with wearing anything.

So what to expect? Lots of loud music, lots of people dancing and people getting drunk. You will see people shouting to each other trying to have a conversation over the noise and at the bar you'll see people three deep trying to buy drinks. You will find guys trying to chat up girls and the girls ignoring them mostly. I will imagine it will all seem a bit strange and probably pointless to you.

true,steers82,num10,,"Spurs need a new stadium with greater capacity, the 36000 odd seats they have right now is a little on the small side.

At the end of the Olympics the Olympic Stadium will be vacant. West Ham, Spurs and a bunch of other groups have all stated they would be interested in using the venue. Everyone put in different bids that involved variously removing the running track, removing seats etc. On the Olympic side of the argument, British Athletics would rather have the track, which would make for a thoroughly rubbish football stadium.

Spurs have, for a very long time, stated they want to redevelop their ground around the current stadium at White Hart Lane. As far as I am aware, they have planning approval and the designs for a 56000 seater stadium right next door to the current one.

Obviously Haringey Council want Spurs to stay in the area and redevelop. On the other side Daniel Levy and Co don't want to spend any more than they have to.

So far there has been a fair amount of back and forth on all sides regarding who was doing what. From what I can tell Levy was bidding for the Olympic stadium so he could get more money from Haringey in support of the stadium. The last thing that was said on the matter was that Spurs would stay, and West Ham would get the Olympic stadium. 

Right now, I think Leyton Orient are complaining that if West Ham move in to their area, it will bankrupt them.

For more information see the wiki page on the olympic stadium.

The internet will be censored. No amount of campaigning is going to change that. I'm a realist with an interest in the history of propaganda. Selling this to the masses is child's play. Seeds have already been sown e.g. the recent English riots, where social media was blamed. Terrorists use the internet and now children are watching hardcore S&amp;M videos. It's a done deal, unless of course you have a few billions to purchase a TV network and a couple of newspapers. *Then* you might make a difference in public opinion.

true,Philomathematics,hartnell,Hartnell,"This. Is exactly how I feel. I've watched everything that exists from 8-11 (though I need to start on the audio dramas to get a better feel for McGann's Doctor), and have watched episodes of Hartnell, Troughton, and Tom Baker. And each one so far has been *the* Doctor in my eyes.

I only just started watching Doctor Who this past summer, and I started on *Rose* with the Ninth Doctor, thanks to Netflx. From the moment he appeared onscreen and told Rose to run, I was sold. Like Rose, I trusted him immediately in that moment, and he never let me down. It was jarring, seeing him regenerate, but Tennant hooked me pretty early on too; by the time he was fully recovered and telling off the Sycorax, I knew that this was the Doctor I'd heard about, the one who would talk and talk and fight when needed. And when Smith came along, his Doctor intrigued me from the start as well, and I've loved seeing the character evolve under his direction.

Going into the classic Who, Hartnell commands my respect and Troughton helps me see the continuity between 2 and 11 very clearly. And of course Tom Baker is quintessentially the Doctor as much for his talent as his longevity in the role. Like I said, I need to see more of McGann, but I loved the whimsy and innocence he brought to the part; this is the Doctor before the Time War, and it kills me to imagine that he's the one who makes the decision to lock away his own people.

So long story short, each Doctor I've seen so far has been *my* Doctor, each for his own reason. I respect Hartnell, love Troughton, revere Baker, adore McGann, trust Eccleston, run with Tennant, and would follow Smith wherever he leads. And I have high hopes for all the others I haven't yet seen.

Why in 2011 are we not all job sharing on 2-3 day weeks with 100% employment.  For whose benefit are we stuck on the perpetual treadmill of growth devouring our natural resources?

There has to be a way to rewrite the equation that requires growth for employment.

Markets can produce useful innovations and beneficial efficiencies but they seems to have been completely subverted. We're all now trapped in a system that has ceased to improve our wellbeing, and without any leaders brave enough to even imagine a way out.

Look; no one competes with china on manufacturing wages; no one wants too. There is no benefit to our economy in having millions of people earning a pittance for wages; they'd suck more value out of the economy then they'd add in. Look at the north of England in the area's where people used to work in textiles; those same people unemployed by the shifting of the factories to china are now employed at a higher wage running the warehousing and distribution around the country. Those same garments they used to sell in our high-streets the public is now paying half the amount of money for.

Countries like ours need to occupy the high-value end of the manufacturing spectrum to make ends meet (e.g. only about 5% of the cost of an ipod actually goes to china). That means having things like sports cars and aircraft to export (yes, even defence products). It means having the financial know-how to sell to businesses in developing markets (yes, financial is an export too), but more crucially it also means having people with money to import them.

Companies can reduce wages slightly, or reduce the working week, to stay in business. Germany did that for its manufacturing sector, but then everyone I know out there tells me the working conditions are terrible as a result. 

Our big problem is there is very little we can do to export our way out of growth if no one has the money to import our crap. National politics aside, our fate is largely out of our control.

I went there because I wasn't sure if the motor would get through. It was £48 for an MOT and £24 for a re-test back then (18months ago). The council service their own fleet of vehicles but by law they have to offer their garage to the public too for some reason.

true,JB_UK,null,null,"Here's what I'd do. Set up a government agency, which will:

* Perform a survey which jobs are most in demand.

* Go to employers and ask them which qualifications and skills they look for in employees.

* Fund the unemployed with relevant entry skills to do those qualifications, with the money recouped from future earnings of the graduates of those schemes.

* If useful qualifications don't exist, work with employers to set up good training schemes, in partnership with local universities and colleges, including apprenticeship/learn-on-the-job programmes.

At the moment Job Centres are almost useless. They provide no careers/training advice whatsoever, except that which advisors can offer on their own initiative, entirely without management support. Many advisors are ludicrously poor, the good ones aren't incentivized to find people work, and jobseekers are bounced around from one to another. The Job Centres are a network for administering jobseekers allowance at the moment, nothing more. 

Partly the reason it doesn't fulfil any more advanced role is cost-cutting, and it's hard to think of a more obvious example of cutting off your nose to spite your face. But it's also because these sort of government involvements have been mistakenly bundled up with the sort of public industrial policy we saw in the 70s, universally dismissed as 'picking winners', caught up in the battle between socialism and the right. We desperately need a more pragmatic, nuanced and active attitude towards government employment and industrial policy, and that goes for all parts of the political spectrum.

Take an example from the third world. Imagine you have a thousand people growing food- tilling the soil, planting crops etc- with half working their own land, the rest working for a land owner. That situation could carry on, with people eking out a subsistence year to year. Some years people starve, others they do well. Short, brutal lives. The farmer then gets a loan to modernize his farm- a tractor, fertilizers, better irrigation. In so doing he increases the output of his farm fivefold, requiring 20% of the number of workers. That's growth, and it is a threat, a disruption, and an opportunity. 

What happens from then on is up to the social charter that exists between the farmer and the people around. Does he reinvest his profits in the local area or send it abroad? How much do the people levy in taxes, and what do they spend it on? You could have, on the one hand, 500 people immediately unemployed, the rest progressively forced to sell their land under eminent domain and ejected, on the other hand new schools, new industries, improved healthcare, a safety net to protect the vulnerable.

Honestly, there are no good web developers who learned everything they know in education - there are no courses in existence that actually teach even 10% of what you need to know to be a good all-around web developer.

You just have to get stuck in there, I've been doing it for 16 years (total) as a hobby, 6 years part-time and then 3-4 years full time now. For the last 4 years I've literally been learning new stuff every day and I still have a way to go - and really because the web and it's technologies are evolving all the time you will basically have to keep up to date with everything forever if you really want to be highly skilled at what you do.

I still see new websites popping up that are, behind the scenes, as if they were written in 1999 - some people don't keep up and as such they are making terrible, inaccessible websites, they're taking much longer then they should (as efficiency is always increasing too as there are easier ways to do things all the time too).

Honestly I wouldn't blame anyone for not hiring someone in this field straight out of uni because they will be absolutely useless and barely worth paying them minimum wage... unless they've spent a massive amount of their free time on it too then there is probably no point even bothering. Of course that is if you actually want to be good at what you do - plenty of people just do a half-assed job of everything their entire life and are quite okay with that as long as they have an income!

true,bowling4meth,english,Straight out of Surrey,"&gt; If they raise prices, they risk being out-competed (in a fair market).

Which if we had a fair market you wouldn't need those parentheses. In the real world they have three options:

* Pass the costs on
* Absorb the costs and recover it by reducing costs (such as labour costs)
* Do something else to offset the cost

Of the 3 the last one is most likely to lead to something illegal, moving functions out of the country is a way of potentially reducing costs, and a combination of cost reduction and passing it on is usually what happens.

&gt; Why would any company leave a multi-trillion dollar a year economy? 

Perhaps when I said leave the UK I should've been a bit more full in my comment. You pay an extra 10% in taxes and your margins are say, 20%. You're going to find that due to the extra taxes your margins will drop (your company's taxes in theory will also drop, at least the ones based on profit so it's not bad but it doesn't quite even out). You may think that's something that can be swallowed by the company but they will be forced to recover that extra cost somehow, especially if they're publicly listed. If the tax increase is 10% and the margins you're making are 5%, then you're probably fucked.

You don't have to move the entire company out of the UK, just the bits that handle profits. A common trick is to offshore the financial function to somewhere with better taxes (Bulgaria for example), so that invoices and such get paid into a place with a better tax regime. The best part of this is that Bulgarians are probably going to be relatively cheaper and as you don't need to duplicate the function you can get rid of most of the UK finance team (as well as any other country's finance teams) in the medium term to recoup the costs of setting up.

You might then want to move manufacturing to China or Vietnam depending on what you're making. Perhaps you can run your HR from Spain. Sales are generally best left in each operating country, but there's no reason if you're really stuck that you can't shut offices down in the Benelux and just have a guy who works from home there reporting into Germany. Likewise you'll probably want a sales guy in the UK, but there's no reason why they couldn't cover Ireland as well, so shut the Irish office down.

Of course, if your sales in the UK start to suffer then maybe it's time to pull out of the UK. There's no reason why you can't serve the UK generally for most products from Germany.",0,1318448137,null,0,false,0,c2qyf3j,t3_l9dpb,t1_c2qyf3j,t1_c2qxe8i,1427722511,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

No, not particularly. I've never seen the point in taxing the poor, it's counter-intuitive. As for record profits, that's not happening all around the board. There's plenty of places that are suffering quite badly, and with everything else going on it's a balancing act, one which unfortunately unfairly favours those doing extremely well, but nonetheless needs balancing in favour of businesses that aren't in order to keep people employed.

In the case of the student protests it is worth remembering that the very first march was being policed by 250-ish standard police officers, they didn't even have the riot police on standby let along in attendance. It was only after a small part of the march decided to split off at Millbank which then turned into a riot that the problems started. And it was the sacking of Millbank that turned public opinion against the student protests. The second march was more heavily policed, but again it turned violent (I was watching it on the net, they tried to march into Whitehall, were stopped and things turned ugly) and the media could easily highlight it as a violent protest. And the 3rd protest was just nasty, I was watching that on Sky News and the level of anger and aggression on both sides at the front lines as palpable. 

What I am suggesting is that when it came to the 3rd protest, instead of being highly mobile, aggressive and loud, they should have simply marched to Parliament Square and sat down. It's very hard for people who are sitting down to be seen as aggressive, or even a vague threat. And that limits the responses the police can use, dramatically. They can kettle people, but what happens if the people then refuse to be de-kettled? Can't charge horses at people sitting down because they can't get up quickly enough. And if there are thousands of you just sitting down and refusing to move, its very hard to drag everyone away. Especially if people just go limp, offer no resistance, and just sit down again where ever you move them to. If they arrest people, they can just continue doing it at the police station by refusing to get up and leave when they are released. 

It sounds stupid. But its a way of protesting that the police aren't able to deal with, and the media aren't able to demonize very easily. No one is being aggressive, no one is causing trouble, they are just getting in the way. And while the press might take the piss to begin with, they will change their tune when no one has moved and it's the next morning.

The imbalance is completely outrageous.  The fiasco whereby large corporations, such as banks, make record profits and continue to slash investment and jobs in Britain, whilst making us pay for every cost they incur is completely fucked up and unacceptable.

BBC America, despite the name, is not properly part of the BBC but is a commercial channel that shows several (but not exclusively) BBC program(mes) including post-2005 Doctor Who.  Episodes from the classic series are available on DVD and, ahem, elsewhere.

As many have mentioned, a lot of us in the States were introduced to DW through something called the Public Broadcasting System (PBS) which is a network of local stations across the country that show a lot of educational, current affairs, and arts programs, as well as many British imports.  (Upstairs Downstairs and Monty Python were big hits for PBS.)  PBS is largely commercial-free and supported by a combination of some government funding, some corporate donors, some charitable grants, and donations pledged by viewers during the frequent fundraising drives aired by PBS.

When the Tom Baker episodes first started airing in the States, it was not on PBS but in syndication, which means local independent stations bought a package of episodes to air whenever they had a gap in their schedule.  Some Americans circa 1977 would see DW first thing Saturday morning, some 7 PM Tuesday night, et cetera.  It developed only a small cult following then.  It picked up some when the show got purchased by PBS but even then the schedule stayed random and arbitrary.

DW only really got big here after 2005.

When I've worked in those sorts of positions in small offices I become tech support, for example, or the guy who knows HTML for the website.

Another part of this, unfortunately, is equality legislation, which demands a heavy formalization of the recruitment process.

true,bowling4meth,english,Straight out of Surrey,"&gt; The obvious way to deal with outsourcing is to tax it to get the right balance. It's the only thing we can do given that we absolutely can not compete with the cheap labour elsewhere.

Taxing things won't help at all. I'm not even sure how you could tax outsourcing. That's protectionism taken to a whole new level. I see your frustrations but I just don't know how that could even work, let alone when you get to the arguments about whether or not it should be done.

It's very easy to think that a large number of big corporations make all the cash and keep it from the poor but this isn't really strictly speaking true. For one, the number of businesses in the UK is huge and most people are employed by what's called Small to Medium Sized Enterprises (SMEs). These aren't necessarily doing much by way of tax avoidance (they might mitigate, even individual contractors tend to mitigate although they'll probably have an accountant do that for them). SMEs are generally between 20-250 employees in size and we have tons of them. They're all paying reasonable taxes but as they hire the most people we're really where we need to promote. When I see incentives for companies like Toyota in some respects it makes me cringe, as those incentives are quite perverse. Toyota and other car companies end up relying on incentives and play governments off against each other to move manufacturing around when in fact manufacturing for the UK market would be quite expensive to move to Germany, and uncompetitive to move to Japan (where the dev costs would be lower but shipping significantly higher).

On the other hand, the flexibility with VAT and government's commitment to paying SMEs quicker is probably doing more to help SMEs than anything else at the moment.

The only thing that will create jobs will be SMEs and new enterprises. Everyone else will look to cut costs for various reasons, some real, some bullshit. Therefore we have to try and boost the economy by convincing and supporting the economy into working for themselves and starting new businesses, and supporting SMEs with things like NI contribution schemes for new permanent hires.",0,1318453152,null,0,false,0,c2qz8xb,t3_l9dpb,t1_c2qz8xb,t1_c2qykke,1427722901,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

Likewise many travellers make their living out of intimidation and deceit running a gamut of crimes from mugging to fraud.

On one hand I'd really like to see things from another perspective and maybe understand more about what the exact considerations are here in terms of human rights and the bigger traveller vs everyone else story.

On the other hand I really can't accept that a group can live outside the laws that everyone else must abide by just because they've managed to get away with it so far and can now call themselves a community. It goes against the sense of fairness that is so important to english folk and I think that any other non-traveller group would suffer the same lack of support for the same reason. 

I hate how right-wing this whole debacle has made me feel but I honestly believe the travellers are the ones that have got themselves into this situation and by doing so they've taken the several MILLIONS of pounds out of the pockets of much more deserving parties. For the price it's going to cost to sort all this out they could've bought a shit load of computers for schools or new books or science equipment or any number of other things that would have a positive effect on people's lives. Instead it's got to be spent on making people's lives a misery.

&gt;It was a tad extreme yeah, but to be fair, they are ruining their children's futures (who didn't choose to be born travellers) and any normal parent who prevented their children from attending school and raised them in such a brutal culture would surely be referred to social services and probably end up losing custody.

State action only makes this worse. Taking children away to stamp out a 'backwards' or 'immoral' culture that 'contributes nothing to society' has been tried many times. Look at the experience of the Native Americans in Canada, or the Aborigines in Australia. The result was a generation of bitterness and hate.

&gt;Likewise many travellers make their living out of intimidation and deceit running a gamut of crimes from mugging to fraud.

Many people in the country make their lives this way. Why not clear out problem housing estates in the same way? Inner city black neighborhoods are by and large hot spots in the crime stats, so why not enact similar policy there?

Because collective punishment or the targeting of an entire culture with state repression is, rightly, a crime in international law.

&gt; They are able to escape punishment due to their mobility, the fact they stay as a large group which quite frankly scares off many of the police and the police's sadly justified worry that if they go in heavy-handed they will face condemnation by the media.

I have literally never seen the media side with anybody other than the police if they face resistance, particularly from Gypsies. Maybe the guardian or radio 4, but the papers most people read would probably be braying for blood.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt;But the retaliatory reaction of the travellers has only galvanised public opinion against them.

I venture that public opinion on gypsies does not need galvanising.

Your looking at the issue in a vacuum. Taking aside the 100 years plus of animosity between travelers and the rest of society, there is a more recent legal issue. Travelers want to live in caravans, and are legally prohibited from pitching up and moving around as they used to.

It was an active government policy in the 1990s to force them to settle down in permanent sites. The issue is that few councils feel inclined to give them planning permission, for obvious reasons that they bring with them a vicious cocktail of social ills (to otherwise rural idylls). To put it another way, travelers have very little opportunity to pursue their culture legally, hence illegal sites. Faced with a choice they choose their culture over the law. Thats why I say its a political problem that is not being addressed.

Either you crack down violently to make the travelers act like we want them to, or we try to reach a political settlement to resolve this societal conflict. Whether or not the dale farm residents are moving or not is moot. The state has now staked its authority on the matter, and that is that.

To come back to your original point: the Travelers are split down the middle. Most of the families have left the site already, according to the PE report anyway. Effort should be focused on engaging with the constructive elements of the gypsy council.

* Cycling home after a game of tennis and some kids riding at the side of me shouting ""gimme ye fecking fone."" I told them to fuck off.
* Local garage break-in's including my own, stealing all of my power tools. They tried again two weeks later...
* Driving to work one morning and I saw a bus ahead of me getting bricked as I drove past the camp.
* I was walking round to the local shop for a paper and this gypo kid was walking ahead of me shouting at some younger kid across the road ""do you wanna a fecking fight?"" so I said to the gypo kid ""does he look like he wants a fucking fight!"" in an equally menacing way. 
* The local co-op had to employ a security guard because of the rise in shop lifting. It doesn't now because we haven't had a traveler population for a few years.

**There has been a scrap yard on the area where the travellers now live since the 1960's.** (yes the bit in green belt land that they illegally built on) Yes the 19 fucking 60's! The travellers cleared the scrapyard and put down their caravans.

This is why some people are up in arms about it.... **the scrapyard was also there legally** (I kid you not, it was granted an exemption from green belt planning legislation!) and this was only retracted because under planning law if you change the land use you need to re-apply for planning permission, which the travellers didn't.

Classic example of the media misrepresenting the facts, although it is hidden away on the dale farm FAQ website

&gt;A Lawful Development Certificate in accordance with the 1990 Act was issued by the Council in 1993. This reaffirmed that the scrap yard was immune from enforcement action.

&gt;The use of the land as a scrap yard ceased in 2001 and the ensuing change in use to a traveller site has resulted in the abandonment of the scrap yard use. Any alternative use or reinstatement of the scrap yard once the travellers have been removed from the land will require planning permission. Planning permission will not be granted for any use that is not compatible with the land's Green Belt status.

No, obviously I wouldn't be able to, I don't know enough about the economics of Nepal for example to tell you whether or not they or some other random country doesn't implement protectionism somewhere along the line, and to be honest I wouldn't be surprised if everyone did to some extent (for varying degrees of protectionism). But like capitalism if unchecked, protectionism is bad for everyone as it drives up prices and makes markets less efficient.

I see where you're coming from in all this, and it's clear that you have strong feelings about this and the politics behind it. I'm not convinced that it's a good plan.

Not sure which episodes you saw but the 9th Doctor (Eccleston) only did one season (technically Series. Doctor Who seasons existed from 1963-1989. Now we do Series because its not a reboot, it's a revival, but no one wants to start watching a show on season 27, yadda yadda), which is rare (almost unheard of) for an actor playing the Doctor, and that one season *really* has its ups and downs. I made some recommendations in a separate post in this thread if you'd like to check them out.

Also, despite its current huge popularity, I've said for years (I was a fan well before 2005) that Doctor Who isn't for everybody. The concepts are very sci fi. The execution of said concepts is almost the polar opposite of a really tight semi-realistic sci fi show like BSG. Basically if you're looking for it to follow any rules, including and especially its own, you'll probably get annoyed quickly. The idea behind Doctor Who isn't to be ""sci fi"" in the traditional sense, but to be an interesting vehicle for the writers to tell any kind of story you can imagine, including the occasional serious sci fi story, but that is, especially nowadays, the exception by far instead of the rule.

Nepal is definitely not a wealthy country and to be fair, I only asked for a single exception.

&gt;But like capitalism if unchecked, protectionism is bad for everyone as it drives up prices and makes markets less efficient.

Many things, if left unchecked can be bad.  I'd like to see better regulation, so I'd hardly want it unchecked.  

Societies are made of people, what good is an efficient market if it is accompanied by mass unemployment and impoverishment?  Demand is important too, without it businesses will lose money.  As unemployment soars, people spend less, businesses lose money, businesses cut jobs leading to more unemployment and even less spending.  It's a vicious cycle, which won't lead to a prosperous economy.  

&gt;I see where you're coming from in all this, and it's clear that you have strong feelings about this and the politics behind it. 

And you couldn't care less?  Maybe because I live in this society, I'd like for it to do well.  Besides, it's not like those without any stake are incapable of being blinded by their principles or politics.

* The doorbell rings and Sally chooses to go answer it.

* Kathy stays behind because she's scared.

* Kathy explores while the stranger attempts to verify Sally's identity.

* The stranger reveals that his grandmother sent the letter and that her name had been Kathy Nightingale.

* While Sally is freaking out, Kathy runs afoul of the Weeping Angels and ends up in Hull.

* She meets Ben, who follows her into town and marries her, setting into motion the birth of her grandson, causing her and Sally to be separated in the future. She even basically wrote a script for her grandson, by telling him to verify identity, etc.

This closed loop is kind of a mirror of the overall arc. In chronological order:

* The internet discovers a series of 17 DVDs that all have the same easter egg; that of a man saying cryptic things. Like we do, the internet began analyzing everything about it.

* Sally goes to tell Lawrence about his sister and learns about the easter egg.

* She is inspired to go to the police, causing Billy to be sent back to 1969, where he meets the Doctor and Martha.

* The doctor, following a script of his own, tells Billy that he has to get a message to Sally Sparrow. But it's going to take his entire life.

* Sally meets a dying Billy only an hour after meeting him for the first time. He tells her to look at the list.

* Sally does so and realizes the connection. She calls Lawrence and tells him to bring a DVD player to Wester Drumlands (not sure how to properly spell that.)

* They watch the easter egg and Sally begins ""conversing"" with the Doctor. Lawrence starts writing down Sally's lines, intending to share them with the internet.

* Instead, the Angels attack, driving Sally and Lawrence into the basement.

* There, they take refuge in the TARDIS, which dematerializes around them. The Angels are trapped in a quantum lock, unable to move because they each see the other.

* Sally gathers all the information that led up to those events and dwelt on them for nearly a year.

* One day, while minding the DVD shop, Sally sees the doctor and realizes that she's the one who gave the plan to the Doctor. She hands him the packet of info while telling him that he will be trapped in 1969 someday soon.

* Sometime later, the Doctor and Martha visit Wester Drumlands' and get attacked by the Angels, being sent back to 1969 without the TARDIS. The Doctor opens the package given to him Sally Sparrow.

Stood at her desk for a while and eventually got to ask her the question and she told me she did not know.

 I asked her if she could look it up and for the first time in my entire school career (I was not exactly known for being a rebel) a teacher shouted at me saying 'If I want to go to university you have to learn how to do things yourself!' and then went back to what she was doing. 

I was quite rightly pissed off at this point because all I wanted was confirmation about something that they should have known off the top of their head (I was happy to do it without VB but would have been better with). I looked in the reflection behind her to see just what was so important to her. She was on asda.com doing her weekly shop. That is the last time I ever asked a question in that class.

You do realise the country is in masses of debt and what the Tories are doing is trying to get that under control. Of course this is unpopular, it always is and we much prefer the false feeling of prosperity when lots of borrowed cash is swilling around. I personally detest the fact as much as anyone else that they have axed some social programs rather then taken on corporate tax avoidance, but to simply view them as some evil entity who wants to ruin the country is naive as compared to the reckless debt enslavement the last lot left us in (you only need to look at Greece and the events to come for Spain and Italy to see how that can play out).

If only we had a happy medium between the two.

You know we have been here before of course. In 1997 Labour inherited a budget that was actually in balance after a painful and turbulent decade under the Tories, the public finances had finally been brought under control. But after four years in office Gordon Brown took out the country's credit card and let rip. By the end of 2009-10 our annual deficit had ballooned to £170.8 billion a year

So far out the best of a worst bunch I feel more confident having us under the coalition government then the last lot of warmongers who were intent on sinking the whole country in a mire of ever increasing debt. It was all a false bubble and unfortunately now its popped we are all seeing the reality; eventually you need to pay it back.

A really good friend of mine would talk nonstop about this show, and at the time i was on a HUGE netflix high. I would spend 2-3 hours, minimum, watching different tv shows and movies. So seeing on how it was on Netflix at the time, i decided to go with it. 

It took me a bit to get really into it at first. I would go a couple of days, up to a week or so, between episodes. It wasn't until i got to the episodes ""The Empty Child"" and ""The Doctor Dance"" that i really got into it. After that i would watch a couple of episodes daily. I just fell in love with it and ended up watching all of the first 4 series, the ones with Christoper and David, in a little less than a month. 
I had to watch the specials betweeen series 4 and 5 on various websites where i could find them, but managed to catch up in time before series 5 started. Watched them the sunday after they aired on the BBC website via a UK proxy that i found and have been keeping up ever since.

I love me some Doctor. ",0,1318484054,null,0,false,0,c2r3i35,t3_l9r3y,t1_c2r3i35,t3_l9r3y,1427724971,1,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,1

&gt;Inner city black neighborhoods are by and large hot spots in the crime stats, so why not enact similar policy there?

We already do, all I am saying is that we must enforce the law.

When the police arrest those committing crime in inner city neighbourhoods, no sane person complains of racism and so forth. However, all too often the gypsies are above the law, they can do whatever they want, because the police can't enter their camps for fear of violence and cries of ""racism"", meanwhile their illegal settlements are actually accepted by the high powers of government in the human rights courts, etc. - normal people look at this and are rightfully angry, when there are hard-working people who can't even get a council home, and yet these leeches have millions wasted on them.

I was inspired by the striking visual style of the 5th and 6th season, and I've begun painting dramatic scenes inspired by the show (Most recently, a shot of the TARDIS from Dorium's POV in 'A Good Man Goes to War' with the Doctor Silhouetted against the open door of the Tardis.)

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt;What about the human rights courts, that would actually be the ones taking action agains the police?

Just to get this out of the way first: in a riot situation the police can hit you over the head with sticks as much as they want, as long as they can justify it. If they were doing this to defend themselves from attack the law would protect them. 

&gt;We already do, all I am saying is that we must enforce the law.

You said rather more than that, in case you forgot:

&gt;They should just send in the armed police, take the kids in to care and arrest the parents. Moving them on is not enough, as they'll just cause problems elsewhere.

That is collective punishment.

&gt;You're quick to compare it to race, but the difference is that the gypsies define themselves by their behaviour - in choosing to remove themselves from society, they are not defined by some immutable characteristic they have no choice over, such as skin colour, etc.

Whether or not they have a skin colour does not matter. They were born into a minority community that has existed for a long time and is legally recognized. The issue with black inner city communities, I hope your aware, is nothing to do with their skin colour. 

&gt;When the police arrest those committing crime in inner city neighbourhoods, no sane person complains of racism and so forth. However, all too often the gypsies are above the law, they can do whatever they want, because the police can't enter their camps for fear of violence and cries of ""racism"", meanwhile their illegal settlements are actually accepted by the high powers of government in the human rights courts, 

This string of prejudice overlooks obvious facts. The gypsies on (the illegal part of) this site will be be removed, and it is not the first eviction. Only the other week, the police had broken up a human slavery case in a traveler camp. 

Your comment is complete assertion, but even if it is all completely true, the law is not in the business of putting entire communities on trail. To come back to my analogy: there are parts of my city that the police rarely enter for fear of causing a riot situation, and as I said often face claims of racism when enforcing the law.

So I ask you again: why are you only advocating collective punishment of gypsies?

&gt;when there are hard-working people who can't even get a council home,

A terrible situation, but *nothing to do with the travelers*. This is a classic device of hate. Channel frustration from an unrelated social ill, and blame it on a minority.

&gt;yet these leeches have millions wasted on them.

I personally believe they are cutting to hard and fast or they should at least be counter balancing the cuts with more actions to promote growth - namely measures such as removing stamp duty to help jolt the property market into action. Lower VAT. Put much more money towards building new infrastructure  (roads, bridges etc) to get more people working, especially in the north of the country where the recession is biting much harder. I would also do more to make it easier for companies to hire so perhaps take a look at NI contributions. 

On the whole though its easier for me to make those points as I can't see the real state / mess of the books. I should also add to pay for those changes requires money of course, so somewhere a group of existing services are going to lose out (robbing peter to pay paul).

What I do believe they have done well is start to immediately tackle the horrendous deficit we have. I believe we would be a lot more in trouble had Labour got another term in power as this was far down their agenda. 

I like the [freedom bill](http://services.parliament.uk/bills/2010-11/protectionoffreedoms.html) as the deterioration of civil liberties under Labour were really concerning me a lot.

But to repeat - I really want a government with the balls to go after the corporations who have clearly avoided their tax obligations to the country...especially the likes of Vodafone who started in the UK from a small office in Newbury. They have both failed here as even Labour were to gun shy to do something assertive to address the issue.

And the Tories are using this current, and temporary, level of debt to discredit the investment Labour made in their years of power, and to force through their ideological changes, while doing almost nothing against the financial institutions that got us in the current (and temporary) mess we are in. Yes debt rose under Labour, but the economy grew too - take a look at debt as a percentage of GDP on the ONS website if you don't believe me. Only in 2008, to bail out banks, did the PSBR jump up sharply - for the Labour years between 1997 and 2008 it had been under control.

The introduction to the Penguin Books Modern Classics edition of Nineteen Eighty-Four reports that Orwell originally set 1980 as the story's time, but the extended writing led to re-titling the novel, first to 1982, then to 1984, because it is an inversion of the 1948 composition year.*",0,1318509720,null,0,true,0,c2r53om,t3_la6kq,t1_c2r53om,t1_c2r4o90,1427725730,0,false,BritishTV,t5_2rzot,0

The population has been living off essentially free money for years now, it's going away and when this happens - people get angry.

The economy is collapsing. This is pretty much agreed now, isn't it? We're at peak oil now, it's just not common knowledge yet.

I live in the countryside, and there are three of these types of camps nearby.

On two of these sites, they started building permanent structures straight away (permanent? I thought they were travellers?), and they are now in a protracted legal battle with the local residents and coucil, which it looks like they will lose.

However, on the third site, they set up temporary structures, and applied for planning permission like anybody else, hired a good lawyer (they are far from poor), and succeeded. They now have permanent structures, all legal and above board, and the general support of the locals (with a few exceptions).

No chance to change shit when the spectrum of the protest (Sorry, occupation) is so large. The OWS really are just a bunch of fart sniffing hipsters. It's sad, but true. 

What they should really be doing is protesting specific issues that have specific problems and specific answers to those problems. 

A blanket protest about things being shit will get no where. What's the solution to things being a bit shit? There isn't one. It's too vague. 

The OWS hipsters just want total social change overnight and that's just never going to happen. It shows to me how naive they are, but that's no real surprise since they're mostly college students who've never really lived in the real world. 

Things take time. They always have and they always will. You only need to look what happened to egypt to see what happens when you totally change the way things run over night.

&gt;&gt;They should just send in the armed police, take the kids in to care and arrest the parents. Moving them on is not enough, as they'll just cause problems elsewhere.
&gt;That is collective punishment.

Well I should be clear, if there are families that have given their children a good education then clearly there is no authority to remove them.

This brings up a wider discussion about whether it is really the best environment for a child to be raised in, and just how sacred the family unit should be when weighed against the environment and opportunities given to the child.

This problem does also exist in other impoverished communities, but you do not have protesters out campaigning for them to be allowed to construct illegal buildings and so on.

&gt;So I ask you again: why are you only advocating collective punishment of gypsies?

I'm not advocating collective punishment, just that the laws be applied and the children are given the best opportunities in life.

&gt;A terrible situation, but nothing to do with the travelers. This is a classic device of hate. Channel frustration from an unrelated social ill, and blame it on a minority.

But to a certain extent it is. We have limited resources, and the hundreds of millions of pounds spent on this case could have been invested elsewhere.

&gt;Dehumanising language. Compare a societal group to a vermin. Because what do we do with vermin?

I didn't mean to use it to imply they were non-human, it just seemed the most apt way of describing their behaviour.

I'll be honest, I dislike gypsy culture, but you seem to make out that I am some kind of Nazi. Fundamentally, I believe that every sector of society should be equal - that is, in having an equal obligation to work, and providing equal opportunities to all - the gypsy culture goes directly against this, as they do little work and often deny their children an education. Not all cultures are equal, I'll attack Islamic forced marriage just as much, and the anti-intellectual ""gangsta"" culture as well. I suppose the real difference is that groups I am associated with (the Socialist Party, UK Uncut) are out there arguing that these gypsies should be above the law, and I just cannot agree with that.

I know I keep bringing up the aborigines, but this was exactly the same reasoning used to take their children away. A sort of kind hearted well meaning authority that did horrific damage to that culture and those children. The issue is probably comparable to combating forced marriages etc, which of course requires state force *but* this does not provide the ultimate solution. Political engagement, education and integration do that.

A quick glance at the senior decision makers at Ofcom reveals that the regulator is mostly made up of former Channel 4 and BBC executives, some of whom are well-linked to and influenced by powerful pro-Israeli politicians and US sympathizers. 

Can't argue with the first part - after all, you would kind of expect Ofcom to have industry people as part of it but go on, justify the second part - how can you objectively say that some of them are 'influenced' by other people?  you could point to facts or you could say, for example that Peter Mandelson has 'an obvious Zionist mindset.' which isn't fact but speculation.

Some people need to learn how to be journalists and how to report facts - they could learn from the BBC maybe?

Also I missed where they explained what the Royal Family have to do with this - they mention (but don't link to) wikileaks documents regarding the British Foreign Office but what do they have to do with the Sovereign figure heads?  The Royal Family are figureheads who have no real power.

[The Daily Mail](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/home/index.html) (Find out what the proles are thinking)

[The Independant](http://www.independent.co.uk/) (variation)

[Google News](http://news.google.com/) (news aggregator, can be good for finding alt. sources)

[Give Me Something To Read](http://givemesomethingtoread.com/) (links to all sorts of sites, generally HQ)

[The Economist](http://www.economist.com/) (Top quality news paper, obvious biases)

[The Atlantic](http://www.theatlantic.com/) (Less common news is covered in article format)

Also [The Nation](http://www.thenation.com/), [The New Yorker](http://www.newyorker.com/), [Reason Magazine](http://reason.com/), [Time](http://www.time.com/time/), [Slate](http://www.slate.com/), and [Vanity Fair](http://www.vanityfair.com/) - all for the same reason as The Atlantic, good in depth articles.

And of course: [Al Jazeera](http://english.aljazeera.net/).

I also use [The Financial Times](http://www.ft.com/), not just good for economic news, but it's actually a very good newspaper in many other regards.

I don't tend to use [RT](http://rt.com/), [CCTV](http://english.cntv.cn/), or any of the North American big news networks (CNN, ABC, etc.) due to the fact that you can generally get the same news with less bias from elsewhere, although if a link catches my eyes I won't let the site distract me, unless it's say, RT on Russia, or China talking about Obama (where it's basically going to be garbage).

Oh and also I'm starting to get interested in giving [Euronews](http://www.euronews.net/) a test run, although I haven't got it's measure yet.

The decline in Reddit's news quality has been fairly saddening for me. I've only been here for 5 months, when I came here looking for live news and information straight from people on the ground early on in the Arab Spring - it was great then. I was able to keep myself far more informed than just by using the traditional news sites, which stayed out of plenty of places simply because it was too dangerous to be where protesters and revolutionaries were. Reddit provided me news straight from those protesters and revolutionaries, and was fantastic.

In the time since then though, I've had to remove more and more subreddits, as we get a steady increase in stupid conspiracy theories, irrational blanket coverage of general hatred towards bankers, financiers, rich people, America, etc, and I find myself considering unsubbing from /r/news and suchlike, simply because the sorts of people who're obsessed with OWS always seem to convince themselves that the reason they're not achieving anything is because the ""MSM"" is censoring them, and that if they just make sure that absolutely everyone, everwhere, no matter whether it's appropriate to the topic/subreddit/country is aware then they'll surely achieve their goal which they haven't decided on yet.

It's unfortunate, but idiots, conspiracy theorists, loons, and people who're just too god damn insular and self-absorbed to realise that sitting around a city for a few weeks isn't more interesting than the combined news for those weeks for the entire fucking world - these people are slowly destroying Reddit as a news source.",0,1318518883,null,0,true,0,c2r64kt,t3_lahfm,t1_c2r64kt,t1_c2r5gec,1428192425,22,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,22

Not really (although I am in no way an expert on royal matters).  If they bore a son then would immediately (i.e. at birth) be an heir to the throne.  On the other hand, a daughter can never be an heir in line to the throne under the current rules of succession because there would always be the possibility that William could have another son (even by another wife) who would take precedence.  Only at the point of William's death would their oldest daughter inherit the throne by default.  But until that point, it could never be assumed that she would.

So I guess they want to be able to give their first born child the right to be named as heir to the throne, regardless of its sex.

I know he's said it's just a job but I believe he's also said he'd much rather do this job than basically any other. 

But we're in total agreement about how good he is. It's like having a deep-lying playmaker at left back. Easily the best passer in the league at his position, and an incredibly solid defender. 

Behind Modric I would even argue that he's our most important player...he's usually #2 or even #1 in passes completed and only Modders touches the ball more for us. That's changed a little with Parker here but BAE is still right there. He starts attacks with incisive passing or crosses from deep or by switching the play. 

Guy is a legend...just unbelievable how far he's come since Harry's been here. Quite easily one of the best 3-4 left backs in the prem, IMO. ",0,1318524136,null,0,true,0,c2r703z,t3_lavny,t1_c2r703z,t1_c2r6e9o,1427726623,6,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,6

As such the amount of land it takes to build a house the size of, say, a Victorian three bedroom semi-detached is **far greater** *now* than it was during the Victorian period.  This is because all of the economically viable methods for achieving the environmentally friendly standards *require space*, which means the amount of space left for the rooms is much smaller.

As a property developer, which do you think is the easier sell?  Bigger rooms or Energy Efficiency?  That’s right, bigger rooms as they are cheaper to build and are preferred by buyers but the *regulations* prevent the property developers from choosing that option.  

We cannot have all of the following:

* Lots of Homes

* Affordable Price

* Energy Efficient

* Good Heat &amp; Sound Insulation

* Big Rooms

The government decided for us and chose to have smaller rooms, more expensive homes but better heat/sound insulation and energy efficiency.

Her faith was there for your first reaction! To have other voices on the show, to included non-White-non-Christians. The episode already had a Christian in the beginning, so they needed another faith for the next character. TV reacts to the current climate and (hopefully) leads the way, at the moment the international climate is wary towards Muslims, so it's up to DW to correct this.

It's a shame your excitement devolved into Token-Black-Guy cynicism.

Not sure the exact reasons why but it would result in the business being able to make more money I think it was the accountant's idea. They were entitled to a bonus/settlement from the sale of the original company and so took a smaller wage for that year and technically I just qualified.

* Tegan Jovanka was the only companion to be a regular in four seasons, putting her well ahead of... MOST of the Doctors, actually. She's the longest-serving companion if you count by continuous time active.
* Jamie McCrimmon was in the most episodes: 117. Not far behind him is the Brig, at 107. In terms of number of episodes, both of them beat out Davison, McCoy, McGann, Colin Baker, and Eccleston. **ETA**: They also beat Tennant and Smith, duh. (*brainfart*) 
* Sarah Jane Smith probably wins if you count by screen time--I suspect she had more than, say, McGann, Eccleston, and possibly Colin Baker.
* Time elapsed between first and last appearance goes to the Brig, (1968-1989, 21 years; include his 2008 appearance in *The Sarah Jane Adventures* for a stunning *40-year* spread). He's also the character who appeared with the *most* Doctors (Troughton, Pertwee, Tom Baker, Davison, McCoy, and even Colin Baker in a non-canonical short).

I tried eating low fat for years and never lost weight. On the other hand, once I learned which foods leave you feeling full for longer and which will leave you unsatisfied I found I could lose weight.

An example; breakfast bars have become popular in recent years. They get sold on the basis of low calories and hence supposedly are healthy. Most of them though are extremely sugary and so just leave you feeling hungry again shortly.

Of course educating people about this would not make food industry happy as that would highlight just how much of the food that is readily available is sugary or rich in processed carbs and not that great nutritionally. So we keep telling people to just count calories and when their hunger cravings get the better of them we can tell them it's their own fault for not being responsible.

EDIT: I just think that asking the food industry for a voluntary 3%-5% cut in calories is not an effective way to combat obesity.

Actually, reading the rest of the article none of the numbers make sense. They keep switching between ""bacteria"" and ""E coli"" levels. At one point they say:

Normally reasonable people will spit blood as they tell you how we get more per capita than everyone else (though I can see from some of your comments here already that you appear to have an open mind on this).

Well they are almost right; as [PESA](http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20101128151454/http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/pespub_pesa10.htm) shows (Chapter 9) Scotland does receive more IDENTIFIABLE expenditure per capita than England and Wales, but less than Northern Ireland and London (when it is considered separately).

But that is only one half of the story - and only part of that half. You also have to look at UNIDENTIFIABLE expenditure. This includes the civil service (largely London), armed forces procurement (M25 and M4 corridor) the armed forces themselves (the MOD has now stopped providing details of where it spends its money as the imbalance was becoming too obvious and embarrassing) and, strangely, East London regeneration.

To get the total picture you need to consider the revenue side of the equation. This can be found in the Government Expenditure and Revenue Scotland or [GERS](http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Topics/Statistics/Browse/Economy/GERS) reports.

The GERS report also shows how the North Sea province would be delineated after independence. My geography textbook from the 70's shows how the North Sea was split between the UK, Ireland, Netherlands, W Germany, Denmark and Norway. I believe there are international treaties and agreements to determine who gets what - and if they could do it in the 70's I'm sure they could do it now.

I felt much of it was unnecessary to tell the story and that it just left the audience hanging for much of the season.

It's that the specific story line of the Doctor's death (and how, why, what happened) was dragged out. Don't get me wrong I enjoyed the episodes for the character development but not for there contribution to the story line. I wish they would've have wrapped that aspect up sooner and moved on, not saved it for the finale. I was disappointed.

The story line with River Song I've always enjoyed, since Silence in the Library. I'm happy to watch it fleshed out and I think many aspects of it deserved a season long run. However, I'm not happy with how it's turned into a serial soap opera. 

I was much happier last season or during Moffat's turn in Davies season 4 when the episodic quality of the show was kept in tact and the over arcing story was subtly laid underneath the season. The show seems to be turning into a giant convoluted troll as far as plots go.

It would not have that much of an effect to be honest, it would rattle the Pound I assume. 

The cost of actually getting to the point of independence would be astronomical and most of the money would be from the UK side, as Scotland would still be in the union before seceding.

Think about it for a second. The military? EVERYTHING would have be cleared from Scotland. Coast Guard? removed from Scotland. NHS? Removed from Scotland. Destruction of all minted Pounds from Scotland? Yeap. Introduction of Scottish money as legal tender? Legal bills would be mental. Luckily the Scottish Legal system is already different to the UK so that would save a few pounds. MSPs would have to do a ton of work to prepare for actually being in charge of taxes and foreign policy. Embassies would have to be set up, consulates moved. Signs would have be altered en masse. Would gaelic be installed as a de facto second langauge? Would the UK actually get an official language?

The cost of which would be in the trillions mark I believe. It's just a farce that the SNP has been riding. The SNP once said ""once we get a parliament we will disband"" Well it's been 11 years and still they are here. 

Scotland has shown time and time again that it is not capable of running itself. If you don't believe me then look up the Darien Venture, which was instrumental in creating the Union. That is where the myth of Scotland being supported by England originates.

It all boils down to the fact this will never happen. The last time they staged an independence referendum it failed. That was back in the 80s. That was when the SNP claimed there was a sizeable claim to the oil, which was never substantiated. The Scottish people would have to agree on it first and foremost, then the rest of the UK, then the terms of independence would have to be worked out between all the home nations, then it would have to be agreed on, then they would have to work out an escape plan, then they would have to ask the Queen if Scotland could leave the union. There's just too many obstacles for it to work and I, for one, will be voting 'no' in 2015 when the referendum is slated to be run.

PS I'm a born and raised Scotsman and I find this to be laughable.

Personally, I hold to the view that the universe *doesn't* resolve paradoxes, and that much of what we observe is actually the net result of the universe oscillating between multiple conflicting timelines. Take Bob, for example:

Bob is a brilliant inventor who creates his own time machine. One day, Bob travels back in time to before his conception, and kills his own mother. Bob cannot exist, therefore Bob's mother is no longer murdered, therefore Bob does exist, and so on.

Now, consider Joe:

Joe is not a time traveler. Joe has lived a hum-drum workaday life, in which he seems to have little effect on the world around him. He has an ambivalent relationship with his mother, who seems manic depressive about him, simultaneously missing him and fearing him at all times. Joe is extraordinarily intelligent, but loses his train of thought easily, and has a great deal of difficulty staying on task. Joe cruises through life more or less on autopilot, with little effort or motive behind any of his actions.

Joe does not really exist, but is the average timeline of Bob and ~~Bob.~~ As the universe attempts to resolve the causality of Bob's actions, it rapidly alternates (at the planck time level) between Bob existing and not existing, and the resulting average is Joe - a directionless half-person, unable maintain enough coherent stability to reclaim his life.",0,1318560241,null,0,false,0,c2rcifa,t3_lb4od,t1_c2rcifa,t3_lb4od,1427729291,1,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,1

I don't think that makes biological sense - I think she used all hers up to stop him from dying, but there's no reason that would also give him extra regenerations.

The 30mb package allows you to download 10gb between 9am-3pm and 5gb between 4pm - 9pm. 

I actually think it might have been a problem with the wireless.  A comment above:

&gt;If you go to 192.168.0.1, default login is admin and pass is changeme. Go into advance settings, choose wireless settings from the lefthand side. There's a drop down box entitled ""802.11 mode"", change that to up to 145 Mbps. After doing this I found all my devices were getting much better speeds, from 0.5mbit/s beforehand now I'm getting 27mbit/s in the middle of the day. Also found disabling ip flood detection and firewall features improved wireless speed dramatically. (Under content filtering - services)

This seemed to have worked for us... I don't know if it was coincidence or not, but ever since I changed 802.11 to 150 Mbps the internet's been working perfectly!

There's just a good degree of cooperation between them all, to the point you'd not notice the difference (actually, given what the tories are upto in England that difference will become painfully obvious soon).

Converting things like the coastguard into a purely Scottish run operation would hardly be a huge undertaking.

An independent Scotland would likely keep its currency and just peg it to the British poiund.

Signs alterned en masse? why? 

There's no doubt that should Scotland go independent there is some work to do and money to spend doing so but to make out like it's some impossible undertaking is pretty wrong in my opinion.  

Also there hasn't ever been an independence referendum in Scotland before... where are you getting that from?

The SNP have proved to me they're perfectly capable of running Scotland, they're the only party willing to stand up for Scottish interests and as far as things like healthcare and education go they're doing a better job than any previous Scottish government.

Should the Scottish people vote yes in 2015 could you really imagine the Queen sticking her nose into politics? She hasn't ever done so and I'd be surprised if she did then.  Can you also imagine the backlash should it be seen that an English government and monarch are not allowing the people their independence?

Sorry but your post seems littered with misinformation and misunderstanding, I realise we're opposed in our support of Scottish independence but there's enough bad information floating around out there thanks to the shitty UK media that I have to ask.

Doctor Who ran from 1963-1989 then rebooted in 2005. By no means do I suggest you start at 1963. You should choose between 2005 reluanch and 2010 when the new writer, Doctor, and companions took over. It felt very much like a re-relaunch.

Pros of 2005: you get to see more Doctors, more adventures, companions, etc. You won't miss out on it by skipping it. No prior info needed to watch here

Cons: It's a bit cheesy and the writing needs a lot of forgiveness the first two series. The show still shines though.

For 2010 Pros: Great writing, shiny new everything, same awesomeness that DW always has, fresh start, no prior info needed

Cons: You miss out on 2005-2009. You won't get to experience the show chronologically and see how things change and develop. You'll get spoiled by the special effects.

Even with these pros and cons, if you choose 2010 you should go back afterwards to 2005 and up. While the writing and effects may not be as shiny, there are still wonderful heartbreaking stories here, and both Doctors absolutely shine. Many people went on Who-hiatus because they thought the new guy wouldn't live up to the 10th Doctor. The ninth only has one series with some questionable writing, but he's a fantastic Doctor as well, and shines when given the chance. No matter what you do, watch all six series.

If you choose to start at 2005, please watch Blink beforehand. 2005 is a little hard and Blink will reassure you that it's worth it.",0,1318565676,null,0,false,0,c2rd9r5,t3_lbap3,t1_c2rd9r5,t3_lbap3,1427729652,3,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,3

Versus saying *The walls were wrinkled, dry and ancient.* you could say *Such a primitive place. One expects to find drawings of buffalo on the walls.*

That's from the essay The Knife here: http://www.kareyperkins.com/classes/112/112knife.pdf

It's brilliant. So I think that you could really work out some stuff with the TARDIS. You could wax eloquent a couple paragraphs just about the outside. The feel of wood, the familiar touch, the warm hum that vibrates within. Resonating. The light at the top.

Then the inside, well that's easy. The atmosphere, the sheer size, the console, well worn bearing upon it's controls the hundreds of years of life. The sense of home, of being lived in, maybe if the Doctor's not in there, it's a sense of something *missing*. The winding hallways? One expects to be lost in there. Like Pan's Labyrinth, one needs a string, something to tether them to the real world lest they lose themselves within it's deep confines.

AND, which TARDIS do you go for? The 8th Doctor TARDIS looks SO cool! The ceiling is the starry sky.

Oh. And something else to think about when you organize your essay. You guide your reader through, like a person is actually examining the TARDIS. Don't start at the base the jump to the top. Work your way from one direction, around, top to bottom, etc. Outward edges toward the console. The console out.

He has been living and working at a Cambridge college for centuries, without anyone noticing due to his eccentric time machine.

""Girl in the Fireplace"" is a good one. Some humour, some frights, some romance, some sadness and two times and aliens (but not rubber suits) to get used to the idea it really is scifi. Maybe start with this.

""Silence in the Library"" and ""Forrest of the Dead"". build up on the Doctor and teases the future. Vasta Nerada are also scary/cool. Since there is a lot of two part stories it would be a little midleading to use only singles.

""Blink"" has to go in, it is probably the best episode and doesn't need lore.

After some thought I reckon ""Eleventh Hour"" should be last.  It is tempting to go for an entirely Tennant run but he isn't the current Doctor, we've moved on. This is also a great standalone episode, shows off the new budget and current cast, is very funny and touching (sort of needed to balance out all the scary so far). Also leaves her with a choice of going back for more Tennant or carrying on with Smith and going back later.

Also make sure not to skip the ""next time"" sections. You can slip in some extra that way. Eleventh Hours is trailer for 5th series and has a weeping angel in it, so tempting.",0,1318568043,null,0,true,0,c2rdkk5,t3_lbfni,t1_c2rdkk5,t3_lbfni,1427729783,1,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,1

One paragraph for describing the appearance of the TARDIS when you first notice it (like a clown at a funeral, awkward in its surroundings, clearly out of place), and then another paragraph for, say, describing the rich colors of it, upon closer inspection (rich, vibrant, deep blue, streaking up and down the wood's grain).

Banging on about the same things as we have for years doesn't seem an effective way to solve the issue.

I've spoken to many people with weight issues while I have been trying to fix my own. Yes, some people eat out of boredom or nervousness. Some always clear their plate because our parents taught us to always do so (which I don't blame them for, it was more appropriate in their time). But some eat because they actually feel hungry a lot of the time and have not figured out how different foods can affect that. Calorie counting does nothing to help with managing hunger, and fat reduction probably makes it harder to feel satiated.

The food industry happily provides food with high calories of little nutritional value but low fat content (as in the breakfast bars) and sell it as ""healthy"".

As for the cause of the perceived reduction in enrolments, EMA was cited as a main reason by only 35% of colleges. The other 2/3rds squared the blame on increased local competition (a touch under 1/3) and increasing transport costs.

When i see people missing Rose I can't help but think that they are missing the love story aspect. The big flaw with Amy in my opinion is that they tried to do with her what they did with rose which is show the events of the show from her angle to introduce it again. She was in constant danger and needed constant saving which I think Moffat knew so he started changing Rory so that he was no longer afraid (my little idea on why he's died so much) He becomes this hero who can save her from the things she does. The doctor made her lose her faith in him I think for the reason that he couldn't be the one saving her all the time from the writer's perspective. Part of me didn't like Donna at the beginning but I felt at some point she matured into her role. The whole Doctor Donna thing was a bit too cheesy for me but it was still fun to an extent. Being a person who watched all of the show from childhood until now I get why rose was needed to re start the show but I don't think she was needed to be the potential love interest though their playful nature was fun. Rose did help but got her self into just as much trouble depending so much on the doctor sometimes making things worse.

Half a mars bar per day will turn you from a Thinifer to a Fattypuff in just a few short years.

Well, I apologise if I've got you wrong, but you pointed out something that New Labour actually did, called it tory ideology and said no socialist would do such a thing. 

I'm sure you've seen committed Labourites make the same sort of claim time and time again both here on Reddit and in the MSM, so it's a logical assumption to make. Again, if you're not a Labour man, then apologies if I've got you wrong.

&gt; I suppose the only way the Tories can hope to hold on to power in 2015 will be by the inevitable goal post shifting with the constiuency boundary changes.

Maybe, maybe, but again it's not like you can't say that Labour are above constituency changes since they did the exact same thing during the mid-90's and then reformed the House of Lords only to stack it up with Blairite allies and cash-for-honours Labour donors.

The tories can justifiably claim that they are simply addressing previous imbalances - I think they might even have done so. 

&gt; Labour already has a 4 point lead in polls and this government is barely 18 months old.

A four point lead in the polls at this stage means nothing, polls only really matter in the run up to an electon.

One of the reasons there is a lack of true competition is the generation firms are also retailers (vertically integrated), which means that they can fiddle their margins by selling power from the generation arm to the retail side at prices that are not a true market rate, which also makes sure that profits are assigned to the unregulated part of the business. 

Importantly it means that if a new retailer starts up then they are forced into buying power from a generator who charges a wholesale price, which is not a competitive price.

true,Halk,scot-lanarkshire,Lanarkshire,"It's a puzzle why the utilities market doesn't work. But there are changes on the horizon. Which? is having a major campaign for them to simplify their tariffs. The problem with energy companies is apathy. If the majority of customers are content not to change, then they make the most profit by charging high. If the majority of customers are content to move once a year then the market really comes into play and we get cut throat competition and lower prices. So Which? are right with their campaign. 

However the companies instead will adopt a policy where they'll pay you to switch. Rather than have low rates and have people move to them for the low rates they'll instead give you a rebate so that they can continue to charge high rates on the people who don't move. That suits us here, as we're on the internet and can change very easily, but for elderly people or the mentally challenged then they're the ones that will end up paying more.

The only real solution is to force energy companies to have one rate and one rate only. To have no dual fuel discounts, no incentives, no retention deals. To have a standing charge (think line rental) and a set fee per unit.

For that to happen we'd need to heavily regulate the product we got from the energy market.

That would then force them to compete with each other on who could make a profit while charging ever decreasing amounts. It'd mean they cut back on customer services - but then again what do they need customer services for if they don't have a gazillion tariffs... Ofcom would need to be on the ball to make sure they didn't cut back on safety and repairs etc. In that market place they'd also be rewarded for innovating with cost cutting - smart meters etc, anything to cut costs.

It'd be entirely unfair on the companies themselves though, it really would be pulling the rug out from under them.

 The Doctor's Wife is the only mention ever of regeneration control to the point of gender swapping, which could mean two things: 1) it had never been mentioned before, and Time Lords who can control their regenerations can swap genders while regenerating or, more likely, 2) The Doctor was being funny. 

I tend to believe the second possibility over the first for two reasons. The first is that it was the only mention, in 50 years of Doctor Who, of gender swapping during regeneration; the second reason, a hinge pin this season, is that ""The Doctor lies.""

Unfortunately the reality is that they do have something to fear.  I'll lump ESA/ICB and DLA together here since they are handled in a similar manner and by the same company - ATOS Healthcare.  

My wife had been claiming DLA (middle rate personal care and higher rate mobility) since 1998ish, with an ATOS medical review every other renewal, which are usually three years apart.  She suffers from chronic back pain, lack of muscle control in her legs, spasms in her arms and legs, and incontinence caused by Tarlov Cysts on her spine, brought on after her ex-husband threw her down the stairs.  She takes 80-100mg of morphine a day, plus 14mg of zopiclone every two or three days so she can actually sleep for more than two hours a day, and has spent 2 of the past 12 months in hospital.

In June last year we were advised by the DWP that she was due for another medical review, the ATOS doctor arrived two hour before his appointment, and spent a total of 20 minutes doing his examination, watched her attempt to walk four feet whilst telling my wife that she should have a commode, lift bars and a platform under the bed and then left.  Two weeks later we were told she was no longer elligiable for DLA since she could ""Walk 100m unaided"" (she's in a *wheelchair*), ""Cook a meal unaided"" and ""Does not need substantial help"" or is ""Not at risk of falls"" despite the fresh bruises from her last fall.

Fast forward to today, 16 months later.  The 1st Tribunal we attended last month was adjorned since the DWP had not contacted her own GP and specialists, and we've now got to wait till early Decemeber, a total of 18 months, during which time we've lost her Motabilty car leaving her pretty much house bound, have lost £400/month out of a £900/month 'fixed income' and have massive arrears on our gas, electric and rent.

The thought of having to go through all this again when she's moved from ICB to ESA is honestly likely to be enough to finish one of us off.  I know I can't take much more.

You're not going to form a limited company, so you're a ""sole trader"" (legal status) operating as a contractor or as a consultant. You don't need to be VAT registered unless you turn over c £45,000 per year. Just print your invoices in Word (or whatever), with your name and address at the top, an invoice number (0001, 0002, 0003, … ), and then ""20 hours services rendered @ £8 per hour, TOTAL = £160"". 

You need to contact the inland revenue and tell them you're self-employed as a sole-trader, and you have to pay your own National Insurance. This is pretty reasonable - something like £6 per fortnight, and you can pay by direct debit.

In this position, you are responsible for your own taxes - the employer(s) won't take the tax off your wages for you. So you'll have to work out for yourself what your annual wage will be, how much tax you'll have to pay, and put a percentage of your wages away in a separate bank account each week. At the end of the year you'll have to make a self-assessment for tax, then pay the full amount.

When you're self-employed it's *very* important not to spend all your weekly income, treating it like it's ""all yours"" - some of it belongs to the taxman.

It can be illegal for an employer to operate in this way, but not for you to accept the terms. An employer cannot employ people as ""self-employed"" if it's their main / only job, they're working out of the employer's premises and if the employer provides the employee with tools (computer &amp;c). These are not the precise criteria - only the gist of it. Contractors in the I.T. industry do operate under these conditions and it's legal.

But the point I'm trying to convey is that generally speaking your employer is probably trying to take advantage of you (to a greater or lesser extent) by asking you to operate in this manner. It would be more paperwork and headache if they were to employ you P.A.Y.E., and they'd probably have to employ a book-keeper or accountant to administer it. It's easier for them to just take your invoices and pay you cash or a cheque. However, you have less legal protection operating in this manner - they don't have to provide you with maternity or sick leave (if you're ill in bed for a week, you can't invoice them), they don't need to give you notice of dismissal, and you don't have any unfair dismissal protections. If the employer goes bust you may have less protection about lost wages.

When my mate's lad goes out posting my advertising leaflets through doors for me, then I require him to invoice me like this and he thus operates self-employed as a leaflet distribution service. It's definitely legit for me and him to operate like this. If I wanted to take on a part-time receptionist or administrator then I would much prefer to operate the same way (the same way you're being asked to), but I'm not sure whether it's legal for me to do so.

So you might ask for extra pay to cover your sickness / maternity / holiday leave - say an extra £1 per hour (depending on the nature of the job) - and point out to the employer that it would be more expensive for them to employ you P.A.Y.E. You might kick up a fuss and *demand* they pay you P.A.Y.E., and at this stage you might even be able to take them to an industrial tribunal.

But if you're happy with the terms - and it does make more sense if you have two part-time jobs - take 'em. The only advice I would give you is to demand that you're paid weekly - that you print the invoice off on Friday afternoon (or whatever your last day is), and that they give you a cheque (or cash) before leaving the office. If they want to pay you monthly then that's a piss-take, IMO. Lots of small businesses go bankrupt all the time, and a month's wages is an unreasonable risk to expect you to take. As someone else said: it *is* a bit of a red-flag someone asking you to do this - they should *want* to be totally legit and pay you P.A.Y.E. (depending on the nature of the job).

You should be able to get free advice at the local chamber of commerce or small business advice service - tell them you've been asked to operate as a contractor and you want tax advice. In my town you can free one hour appointments any time you like from the small business advice service (or could last time I checked) for any kind of advice or help you need.

true,Crabalicious,null,null,"&gt;The economic benefit to the UK would be the sheer avalanche of international business that would flee Scotland the second it left the UK.

It could well work the other way if an independent Scotland lowered corporation tax like Ireland did.

&gt;then the rest of the UK, then the terms of independence would have to be worked out between all the home nations, then it would have to be agreed on, then they would have to work out an escape plan, then they would have to ask the Queen if Scotland could leave the union.

The 1707 Acts of Union were passed by the parliaments of England and Scotland to create a single parliament, hence ""United Kingdom"". In sovereignty terms, Wales and Northern Ireland, while they might be affected, would have nothing to do with it. As a point of interest, I actually think that if it really wanted to, Westminster could probably unilaterally vote to repeal the Act and send Scotland on its way. I'm not sure the Scottish Parliament could do the same thing since it was specifically re-established with limited powers.

We live in a parliamentary democracy, so the Queen would have nothing to do with it either theoretically or in practice. The SNP would have her remain Queen of Scotland, which I think would happen anyway unless she voluntarily handed it over - the crowns were united before the Acts of Union. If the SNP win their vote, it will happen, Queen/English/Tories or not. Cameron's even said other than campaigning for a no vote, he wouldn't stand in the way if Scotland chose independence.

As for the oil, as you pointed out, Scotland and England have different legal systems, and much of the oil lies in waters that are under Scottish jurisdiction. That would be a pretty sound basis for deciding who should get them, but I as I said in another post, it's impossible to tell one way or another how that would be constitutionally settled, and I think it'd be very difficult for the SNP to win a referendum without knowing that in advance. It's a bit of a catch 22 situation.

&gt;Scotland has shown time and time again that it is not capable of running itself. 

Well, we haven't gone bankrupt in the last ten years while we've been administering the cash from the Barnett Forumla. There aren't many things Scotland doesn't run itself already. I'd be interested to know what they'd have done had RBS been a Scottish company though.

I'm yet to be completely convinced about the economic argument, but from a democratic point of view it makes more sense than being having a Tory government that no one in Scotland elected, and in practical terms of how things happen now, there wouldn't be much difference.
