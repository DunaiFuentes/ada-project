There are also darker things they say about him though... such as the idea that seems to have an unusual prediliction, in that a big part of the way he writes stories is trying to think up what scares children the most.

Russell Davies seems to have been the one who had this distinctive dark side to his writings. I'm not surprised that he went on to write ""Torchwood:Miracle Day.""

1. It gets them off their arse more than once a fortnight to sign on.

2. It gives them something recent to put on a CV.

3. It will inspire them to actively look for work to earn more money. 

4. If it doesn't we all benefit from better maintenance of our local areas.

&gt;The current system is broken

I agree. Scotland has a better grasp on their benefit system. They offer free college education. That's something Cameron should seriously consider if he wants to get people off the dole and into work. I know a lot of bright lads who don't have enough money to improve their lives (myself included), all we want is training for trade work building/plumbing/electic-ing/etc. People complain about a lack of 'young' tradesmen, why not just make these courses free?",0,1315199288,null,0,false,0,c2hkal4,t3_k4rvk,t1_c2hkal4,t1_c2hi438,1427559927,4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,4

true,abw,cnty-uk,Surrey,"&gt; Are you saying we should tolerate the EDL?

Yep.  It is a defining feature of a free society that we allow people to have their own ideas, even if we don't agree with them. For the same reason we should tolerate Muslim extremist groups who preach anti-western sentiments.

Note that I'm talking only about *ideas* (i.e. free speech), not actions.

&gt; These ideas should be actively challenged, debated and shot down, with people

Absolutely.  Challenge their ideas, but not with bricks.  That's how we show ourselves to be above them.

Personally I think it would be great if everyone let them have their march and just *totally* ignored them.  They're only having the march to stir up hatred and violence (same thing happens every year in Northern Ireland when the marching season starts).  They're doing it to provoke a response and they're succeeding.  If no-one turned up to campaign against them marching then it would remove any real power or influence they have.

My soon to be son-in-law is in this boat.  My daughter and him are both at college, starting their final years in animal care and electrical engineering respectively.  And they've just had a baby (unplanned).  If they don't go back to college today they can continue to claim IS of £100/wk and live just inside their means.  Going back to college however they have to give up their IS and try and claim whatever the replacement for EMA and ALG is, which helpfully the college has no idea about yet and is likely to be just enough to cover bus fares.  

They both want to study to increase the chances of them getting jobs, but by studying they are worse off than if they just lived on benefits.  That's fucking idiotic.  They want to work, they want an education and the government penalises them for it.  If they lie and claim that they are no longer a couple, my daughter would continue to able to claim IS.   So it's ok for a single mum to go back to college but not for a couple.  So they can go back to college and worry about every penny they spend, lie and worry about getting caught for benefit fraud or stay at home and carry on claiming benefits.  That's fucking insane.

My eldest son has been out of work for 12 months of so.  He spends 16 hours a week volunteering at a local Community Advice place, helping people fill out DWP forms and dealing with issues like debt advice and problem landlords for them.  He's not spending all day in the local park with a four pack of Stella, he's *helping the community!* Yet Mr Cameron would like to see him spend his entire week applying for jobs that don't exist.

My wife and I worked for 20 years, 10 years ago she was diagnosed with Tarlov cysts in her spine and for the last 8 years has been in a wheelchair, in extreme pain suffering from muscle spasms in her legs and arms.  Five years ago I had to give up work to look after her.  12 months ago a Doctor from the DWP decided after a 30 minute 'consultation' that she was capable of walking for 100m and even though she can't hold her hands steady or manage to lift a full cup of coffee and has suffers night incontinence, was capable of preparing a hot meal and looking after herself.  Apparently all the times I've had to lift her out of bed in the middle of the night, clean her and change the bed *she* should have been doing it. So the DWP took her DLA award away.  And paid the Doctor £300 for it.  

Personally I'd like to see Mr Cameron spending a couple of months trying to live on the same amount as an average family on benefits.  It's fucking easy live on a salary of £3k/wk at the tax payers expense, not so much when it's £200/wk.  By all means get the cheaters back to work, but stop tarring everyone with the same brush.

I'm not trying to say that its ok that they cheat benefits but, as you say, there are plenty of tax evaders around that take millions and, in some cases, billions out of the economy. Would Vodafone have gone bust if they had to pay taxes? I don't know but they're doing pretty well now.

They want to work, they want an education and the government penalises them for it. If they lie and claim that they are no longer a couple, my daughter would continue to able to claim IS. So it's ok for a single mum to go back to college but not for a couple. So they can go back to college and worry about every penny they spend, lie and worry about getting caught for benefit fraud or stay at home and carry on claiming benefits. That's fucking insane.

This is stupid and it's much the same with the loss of income support when starting work. Usually the work is too low-wage to offset the requirement of paying council tax, rent, healthcare bills, etc.

&gt;He's not spending all day in the local park with a four pack of Stella, he's helping the community! Yet Mr Cameron would like to see him spend his entire week applying for jobs that don't exist.

This is one thing I really hate about the JSA system, I'd much rather claim the JSA and take the time to revise and improve my programming skills to get a decent job when they are available than be forced in to stupid interview skills courses or perhaps under the new plans, working for companies for less than the minimum wage.

&gt;Apparently all the times I've had to lift her out of bed in the middle of the night, clean her and change the bed she should have been doing it. So the DWP took her DLA award away. And paid the Doctor £300 for it.

Have you tried appealing this? The Atmos stuff was dreadful, but it seemed because of that they had to overturn a lot of the decisions.

&gt;Personally I'd like to see Mr Cameron spending a couple of months trying to live on the same amount as an average family on benefits. It's fucking easy live on a salary of £3k/wk at the tax payers expense, not so much when it's £200/wk.

The Unquiet Dead was ... ok, but let's be honest, Gwen Cooper stole the show there, and it was mostly memorable for being the first time since the rebirth that the Doctor went back to a historical point.  

The other two eps barely had any potential, and were entirely forgettable, if not outright bad.  I only remember Victory for the Daleks because it was soooo bad.  PLANES..! IN..! SPACE.....!

My understanding is that they do... this is from Conservative controlled [Warwickshire County Council:](http://www.warwickshire.gov.uk/web/corporate/pages.nsf/Links/84F635C3BB522D45802572C0003A7A73)
&gt;*Another question we often hear is...""What about their vehicles? None of them are taxed, MoT'd or insured are they?""*

&gt;*A. The police run vehicle checks on new encampments and Travellers are prosecuted as and when appropriate. Many Travellers' vehicles are taxed and some are so old they are tax exempt. Most Gypsy Travellers have modern well-maintained vehicles which are used to support their business interests, so they are almost invariably taxed and MoT'd.There is an issue with some of the vehicles the New Travellers live in, as they are off the road for most of the year. The police will stop any dangerous vehicles as they move between sites, and have them removed from the highway but if an eviction is to be successful arrangements have to be made to allow them to move on.*

&gt;*People say...""I pay out so much per year in rates and taxes but these people pay absolutely nothing!""*

&gt;*A. They don't pay Rates on unauthorised camping sites but will on authorised sites. Many Travellers are employed and pay income tax..*

&gt;*Many of the Gypsies and Travellers who arrive seasonally, for short periods, are little different from holidaymakers in that they have houses or permanent pitches elsewhere in the country. They will commonly be paying rates, rent or mortgage payments at these other locations.*

&gt;*In many ways, Travellers are a lower cost to the taxpayer than other forms of social provision such as housing or temporary bed &amp; breakfast accommodation. To be fair, they find it more difficult to access the services the rest of us use with comparative ease. Anything that needs an address is very difficult for them and they also have problems with medical &amp; dental care, postal deliveries, children's education and steady employment.*",0,1315250112,null,0,false,0,c2ho92e,t3_k5af6,t1_c2ho92e,t1_c2ho56n,1427561871,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

I think with River, they have created someone the Doctor can have an equal partnership with. That really hasn't happened in the series since Romana was a companion for the fourth Doctor. 

I'm also a big fan of the continued story arcs. Again, it harks back to the older seasons. We are getting a good mix of an extended story arc, mixed with individual episodes for a bit of a break/light relief. Best of both worlds in my opinion. 

Besides, River is only one half of the episode arc this season. The other half is the death of the Doctor in 2011, and how exactly he's going to get out of it.

Did you honestly not experience any disruption because of the restructuring? 

I felt that as a whole, the administrative side of the university as a whole was more disorganised than usual, with even the History department, which is normally exceptional, having issues with organising certain things. The Department secretary offices moved half way along University Gardens and back twice during the course of last year. My Senior honours course was shunted around both in terms of time and location far more often than you would expect. Also, the staff were under a lot more pressure than they previously had, and though the strikes were obviously bigger than just GU, it still had an affect on the mindset of the lecturers. 

As for the cuts, maybe you're right about them not having kicked in yet. I can't remember what they decided about nursing and dentistry etc., but the cutting of Slavonic and everything will surely have an effect once it's implemented. You can't deny that removing entire departments and courses (including, afaik, the only PG Diploma in Russian in the UK) should logically lower the rankings.

That said, History (or the School of Humanities) was one of those that was particularly under threat from the proposed cuts, so maybe that explains the difference in perception between the two of us, as let's  be honest, Science and Engineering is under no danger whatsoever :P

Also, re: the occupation. Yes, very few of the students took it seriously, but what I was meaning was that I'd have expected it to have had an effect on the judgements of outside assessors. An institution having to call in the police to keep the peace in their own affairs, then to backpeddle from this under pressure solely from the protesting students, does not look good. Nor does the whole affair with the NUS president. It basically makes the institution as a whole look incompetent and weak.

Her: ""I have seen every episode of Doctor Who, and none of them were ever in black and white!""

Her: ""No. You're lying. What is this crap you're watching?""
Me: *I hold up the DVD case* ""Doctor Who Story 005 - The Keys of Marinus, starring William Hartnell as the First Doctor.""
Her: ""No! There was only Chris Eccleston as Nine, David Tennant as Ten, and Matt Smith as Eleven!""
Me: ""And where do you think those number designations come from? They're the ninth, tenth, and eleventh people to play The Doctor.""
Her: ""You made this DVD at home, didn't you? That's so cheap and cheesy. And that thing on the screen doesn't even look like the Tardis!""
Me: ""I'm not trying to be rude, but perhaps you'd like to look it up before you so fervently argue against what is right in front of you. If you love the current Doctor Who, you should give the classic a chance. It's daunting, and some episodes are missing, but it's really enjoyable.""

At this point I had to forcibly disengage from the conversation. I was trying to be helpful and enlighten her about the classic series, and she continued being very argumentative.

That completely ignored years and years of behavior from a man who was far wiser and far more complicated than a tin-pot despot who tried to conquer NYC with the special-ed class. 

Morrison made two massive mistakes with that story line: 1) If he was dead-set on turning Xorn into a bad guy, then he should have let Xorn be Xorn and left Magneto out of it. There was no reason that arc required Magneto to be the badguy.  2)  Xorn/Magneto's behavior and actions pre-reveal and post-reveal make no sense viewed against one another.  How does one go from zen-pacifist who spends his time teaching the lonely and abused to a genocidal idiot who starts abusing those same kids?  If Morrison's final arc had been a story wholly un-related to the X-Men, no one would take it seriously.

Well... Don't feed the trolls. But homophobes are always fun, particularly when they don't admit they're homophobes and are talking rubbish (surely that's pretty much all the time?) so I'll give my tuppence worth, particularly as most people are just telling you to sod off. You deserve a more thorough response as otherwise you might continue thinking what you're thinking, thinking it's right. And that would never do!

&gt; ‘Gay Marriage’: what you should know

I might be preemptive here but I think all you need to know about gay marriage is: 

*Two people in love get married and are legally and financially secure like most of the other people who get married and it's none of your business.*

How does that sound?

&gt; people are made to do things against their will or face the consequences, so that, for example, if a B&amp;B owner’s conscience

Against their will - like what, treat people equally without regard with whom they choose to love? What the hell has it go to do with anyone else? What does it matter what they do with their time and genitals?

But how amusing. You mention the B&amp;B owners. You realise that their refusal to admit the gay couple is analogous to refusing to let a mixed race couple stay at their B&amp;B? There are biblical passages that can be used to justify mixed marriages as being against Jehovah's wishes, as such the Bull's could have turned away a black woman and a white man who are legally married. After all, it's against their beliefs, right?

Nope. And quite obviously in that case. But of course people who don't like the fact that homosexuals in a civil partnership legally have pretty much the same rights as 'normal' married couples will say that being gay is a choice, or that it's their private home so they should be allowed to refuse who they want. That argument is shite, by the way. It's not their private home - it's a business open to the public, plus you have to have a good reason for refusing someone service. ""They're gay"" is not a legitimate reason. No credible psychologist is of the opinion that homosexuality is a choice. They're refusing someone service because of their sexuality and that's a little bit illegal, I'm afraid.

&gt; they take the hump at being ‘offended’ and cause trouble

""Why the hell can't black people just go to black shops? Taking the piss and getting ""offended"" about not being served in my white shop. Christ, they've got enough places they can go, why do they have to be around here?""

Again it's more obvious isn't it? It's discrimination, not being 'offended'. It is being denied equal treatment because of something innate to your being. That's not hard to understand, really it isn't. Try it for a second. 

I don't like you because you're blonde. No, you can't come in to my shop because you're blonde. I don't care if it's ""not your fault"". Get out. I don't like your kind. Why are you offended? Oh wait hang on yes, I'm discriminating and in our 'liberal' and 'progressive' society, bigot-ism is legislated against for some reason.

&gt; all the others will be driven underground, just like in China

Wow, you do like to over egg the pudding, don't you? Would it surprise you to learn that the [majority of people in the UK don't care or support mixed sex marriage](http://populuslimited.com/uploads/download_pdf-100609-The-Times-The-Times-Gay-Britain-Poll.pdf)? The people in charge might not like it, but the proles are in favour. Well, that can't be right, as you and all your mates think queers are abnormal? Tough - the general public is not as intolerant as you'd like.

&gt; In a sinister development

[DUN DUN DUUUUUN!](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a1Y73sPHKxw) What happens next?! Gay people will be allowed to drive! Maybe there'll be gay people with jobs! Owning houses! Paying taxes and being MPs!? WHERE WILL IT END!?

Seriously, what the fuck are you scared about? What do you think is going to happen?

&gt;  forfeit the right to perform all marriages.

You know that slavery was biblically supported for centuries? Do you think it was the churches that decided to change, the public feeling or political leaders? What do you think would happen if a church refused to perform a ceremony between two black people? [You know the Mormon church changed its mind about blacks being allowed to hold certain offices in the church?](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_people_and_The_Church_of_Jesus_Christ_of_Latter-day_Saints#Racial_restriction_policy) Why might they have done that?

&gt; “Gay Rights” always was about changing the definition of marriage

So what if it is? Who wrote the definition in stone? Why should we not be allowed to alter the workings of certain institutions? Marriage has been around much longer than Christianity, by the way, before you point in that direction. In any case thousands of UK marriages are performed without any reference to Christianity.

&gt; so many people now support the obliteration of normality

Erm, you know how few gay people there are in the world, right? You know that heterosexuals out number homosexuals by an absurd amount? As such the vast majority of relationship will stay straight. What's normal by the way? Do you know that nearly everyone you meet is ""below"" average therefore abnormal? Similarly, nearly everyone else is ""above"" average? Did you know that on average people have less than 2 arms? That's not normal! What is the norm? The mean, median or mode? Who decides what is normal or acceptable?

&gt;  destruction of society  (destruction is inevitable if the basic building blocks – families – are weakened)

Yes I've noticed that since gays were allowed to openly be in relationships, the number of families are declining and the birth rate has dropped. We need to force gays into screwing members of the opposite sex, otherwise our island race will die out. I'm struggling not to be completely abusive to you at this point. It's really very hard.

&gt;  schoolchildren will be subjected to even more propaganda

""Kids! You HAVE to be gay. You HAVE to fuck someone the same sex as you! No you're not allowed to sex a girl, David. NO! You have touch other girl's bits, Amy. BE GAY! STOP. BEING. STRAIGHT!""

You might not have noticed, but 'propaganda' in schools is to make kids aware that many people are gay and that being gay is ok. This is because up until the last couple of decades or even more recently, being gay was something to be ashamed of. The 'propaganda' is to counter people like **YOU** who think that the way someone is born should mean we treat them as inferior, 'abnormal' and ostracise them from living as equals when they are causing no harm to anyone whatsoever.

You know there are more gays than Muslims in the UK? ~3.6million gays (2005) and ~ 3million Mulsims (2010) (not including overlap). Christ, I can't believe all this pro-Muslim propaganda in schools. Some damn pro-Muslim charity is trying to get us to treat Muslims like 'normal' people. I don't get it. They want everyone to be Muslims!? Fuck that. We'll all be abnormal.

Again, your arguments are seeming a little thin, aren't they? Why might that be?

&gt; who are already encouraging youngsters to wear frocks to help them discover their ‘feminine side’.

[Very well done.](http://img156.imageshack.us/img156/8894/kaneklapqo6.gif) Way to miss the point, genius. I'm not sure I can be bothered to explain that issue in depth except to give you a hint that the campaign was maybe about getting kids out of the mentality of thinking that ""this behaviour is not what my sex does and I don't want to be considered homosexual because I'm not acting like my sex should""? Not a bad thing - you really need to think about that more. I'm guessing you don't own *anything* pink? How about a Queen album?

&gt; How much worse are we going to let our society become just to allow homosexuals, a very small minority, to feel that their abnormal behaviour is normal?

How much longer are we going to let black people in the UK think that having black skin is normal? They should be pale, we don't have that much sunlight up here! 

Again: What are you so scared of?! More gays in the world than redheads - Should red heads be encouraged or made to dye their hair? Why are gays different - how are they hurting you? What is wrong with two gays living together and sharing their life in peace? How is that harming society? **FUCKING HOW!?**

Is it worth mentioning the fact that homosexuality is abundant in nature, displayed in many different species? Oh hang on, have Stonewall been [training same sex elephants/flamingos/giraffes to screw each other](http://www.getcited.org/pub/100341565) as part of the gay agenda? Shit, they've even got [to the lions!](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8gttC6P3bE)

&gt; but dressed up as some great crusade for equality.

Again - What **will happen** if we let gays have the same marriage rights as the straights? WHERE WILL IT END!? Will the island spontaneously combust due to the friction from copulating queers?

Seriously. **What. Do. You. Think. Will. Happen?**

The end of the human race? Death from locusts? WHAT?!

&gt; Each of these countries has very serious problems due to their increasingly liberal ‘values’ and multiculturalism.

It's true. Some are on the brink of nuclear war, whilst the old are all being pushed out to sea in barges c.f. *Children of Men*, while the men and women who refuse to have sex with the same gender as them are being thrown to the wolves that have been set up in new ""rainbow stadiums"" where cheering crowds of couples (and more) engaged in outrageous homosexual sex copulate to the screams and then rub eachother in the entrails of their victims.

But seriously - Do you have any stats or examples about those problem nations or are you talking out of your arse again?

Here's a quick question. You mention several countries: I wonder if you can tell me what the capital city of Argentina, or the Prime Minister of Portugal?

Go on. I'm guessing you haven't been able to manage it. And yet you're sure that these countries have *very* serious problems... For some reason I don't think you know much about those countries at all. Accuse me of straw manning - I might well be, but I'm pretty sure you know sod all about any real issues those countries might have.

Yeah, I'm guessing you're talking shite.

&gt; The warning is there. 

Not sure where. You didn't say. You just said something unfounded and left it hanging in the air like a lynched queer hanging from a tree it's what he deserved the queer for being all queer.

&gt; Some people will laugh, of course. 

In disbelief that you think you have any sort of credible argument.

&gt; Some people will call me names, of course. 

To be fair, you do come across as a massive cunt.

&gt; Some people will ignore the warnings from history, of course.

I'm not sure what history you're talking about exactly because you go to say hint that gays weren't tolerated until pre-1990.

&gt; To these people, all I can say is, “Don’t say I didn’t warn you.”

Do you like black people? What about 'the' Jews? I don't think you do. I don't know why, it's just a guess. I'm not saying *anything* about it, but it's just a guess.

&gt; Can you think of any culture in any part of the world at any time pre-1990 which allowed two people of the same sex to get “married” and be legally recognised as such?

Can you think of any culture in any part of the world at any time pre-1800 which allowed two people of different colour to get ""married"" and be legally recognised as such?

That is why you are a complete fucking tool. Heavens, the world should never move forward! I DON'T LIKE CHANGE! I don't like people being happy when we get rid of moronic rules and social constructs that keep people miserable for no reason! I don't like that some people are happy when I'm not!

&gt; Were they all ‘homophobic’ or is there a very good reason for not accepting hedonistic, barren lifestyles as normal for the good of the tribe?

Wow. Just when I thought you couldn't get any better... So come on. You haven't explained the issue yet. Hedonistic how? Barren how?

You know that there are a myriad of gays fucking each other *right now*? So tell me - how is that affecting your life? Or is the plaster falling from the ceiling from the flat upstairs, reminding you that you're not getting any?

I'm going to make a guess and say that the vast majority of gay people who are not being bullied at school by arseholes like you, are far happier with their lifestyles than you are. No, I really mean that and yet I know nothing of you.

And why exactly would gay people not getting married be ""for the good of the tribe""? Which tribe are we talking about? A harem of females and one male - that kind of tribe? 

Times change, societies change. I really don't know who taught you you should hate gay people but really, you need to take a long hard look at why you do. Rationally.

The Tenza infant would adapt itself to to suit its environment and alter the memories of its surrogate parents and those around them.

It was just an intelligence of political subtext and recurring themes rather than an intelligent use of time

The 2005 series has a heavy subtext relating to the war in Iraq (Aliens of London, World War Three, The Christmas
Invasion) and (to a lesser extent) the role the media played (The Long Game, Bad Wolf).

If any thing an average ""Sun Reader"" would disagree with these subtexts, not cheer for them.  His ""reboot"" takes
a quiescently British character and keeps him the same whilst changing the Britain around him.

I think this becomes toned down between 2006-2008 but it's definitely still present.

Once again, television shows us that men are the sole cause of pain and misery to their children. Yeah, the mother was to blame as well, but she was in for less than five minutes, whereas the dad has the whole thing. The dad is some bumbling, spluttering moron who just gets frustrated when his son is scared of things. So, unlike a normal father, who would sit and discuss these things with his son, like my dad did with me, or my uncle with my cousins, or the fathers of any of the children I have babysat over the past five years, he just yells and hisses at him. And of course, in the end of the episode, he FINALLY shows some positive emotions towards his son, who is worried that his dad is going to abandon him (Send him away, but it's still abandoning) and that's how he saves the day. Of course. &gt;.&lt;

Also, from what we've seen through this episode, I think it's safe to say that the setting was modern day times. So why not any Torchwood references? Suddenly the whole world can't die, and NOBODY thinks of doing anything? No news shows about an incoming recession or damage done to humans? That old lady could have at least grumbled about having to live for ever with joint pains or something.

So yeah. The episode was clever, albeit rushed at the end, creepy enough to scare children and unnerve adults, but still. It just HAD to have those two negative parts.

No cases here, but I'd rather have a vague or funny title with a spoiler tag than a descriptive one with a spoiler tag, if the information within is itself a spoiler being described.

2) Jokes

""Not.... not quite, Netflix"" and ""JACK WINS!"" are waaaaay funnier with those titles than they would be without. That's just for example. The link title sets up the joke and makes what would be a cool or funny image even more hilarious. It can also make a random picture funny to begin with. 

3) Do you recognize posts

** Female Doctor: **

For a female Doctor, Joanna Lumley comes to mind, and I know she'd never do it, but maybe Helen Mirren? 

Also, I'm going to get flayed alive for this, but... Marina Sirtis. Yes, she was awful boring as Troi on Star Trek. ...But she was great as other characters. She was excellent at playing really complex, dark cahracters and hiding them under that facade of counselor. I would want to see a screen test first, but I think she might be capable of the mania, slapstick, and gravitas the Doctor demands. 

** Male Doctor: **

For a male Doctor, well, I really want Damian Lewis, just based on Dreamcatcher. I also wouldn't mind seeing Craig Ferguson. He's a huge Whovian and he's capable of being manic and serious. I'd also suggest Richard Grant and Hugh Grant, who have nothing to prove on the Doctor front. 

Also.. and this would never happen... but... Bruce Dickinson of Iron Maiden. Hear me out! He's a huge fan, and the TARDIS has even appeared on some album artwork for Maiden. I've seen him live, and his charisma is off the charts. There are dramatic monologue elements in some of Maiden's songs and he nails whatever character he's running... check out El Dorado for an example. 

Problem is, by the time the rest of Maiden is old enough to retire, he'll be too old to keep up with shooting an intense show like Who.

I would eally like to see an American companion. The show has filmed in America, Americans are really getting into it... I know it's been done before, but let's do it right. Of course, we can't alienate the Brits, either. So why not have a Brit-American companion pair, except have the American really be American, unlike Jack, who was space American.

I'm thinking a British guy and an American girl, but a Brit girl and American guy would be ok. I'd need to have a character outline before I could attempt to cast them.

1 i like to think of time as multiple timelines... the time between the events of when the doctor last saw Amy and Rory and him getting the newspaper about the crop circle is roughly the same. I like to think that time gets slightly modified around each person and as they finished the crop circle, the Doctor became aware of what they'd done. I think they just summoned him and grabbed his attention.

Filming in the U.S. and using American-one offs (played by British and Canadian actors) is one thing. I want to be able to identify with a regular character and cosplay her and not screw up her accent. I want someone to use the lack of knowledge of an American character to teach me about Britain.

Having a Brit-US/Canadian pair would be great because it'd provide a means  to explain anything about either place that might be unclear to viewers in one country or another. The political plot have confused me on occasion, since my knowledge of UK local politics is near nothing. Having an American with a Brit character would help reduce the ""damage"" to the Britishness of the show.

And getting them both together? Simple. Take an international event hosted in the UK and hold a plot there.

It's happened at least twice. There was the ""Space/Time"" specials earlier this year, in which the Tardis appears inside itself, and ""Logopolis"" from the old series in which (if I recall correctly) the Doctor materializes the Tardis around an actual police box, but the police box turns out to be the Master's Tardis and... uhh, there's some kind of infinite progression of Tardises inside the Tardis. I don't remember how it all works.

&lt;i&gt;So, now that we have established that, what would happen if The Doctor set the inside Tardis to go backwards in time while his Tardis was travelling forwards in time?&lt;/i&gt;

I don't get it. Wouldn't the inside Tardis just dematerialize out of the outer Tardis's interior? Not a big fuss.

&lt;i&gt;What would happen if he set them to both travel forward to the same spot? Would the one on the inside arrive first, if so wouldn't there then be two inside Tardises, the one travelling with the regular Tardis and the one that jumped ahead in time?&lt;/i&gt;

&gt;Prior to 1994 local authorities were required to find areas of land where travellers could temporarily stay but the Tories simply got rid of that provision in the hope that the ""traveller problem"" would disappear. But it didn't. Travellers and gypsies were expected to provide for themselves and integrate into the settled community but many lacked the means or know how to do so (literacy rates and life expectancy among gypsies remain way below the national average). Those who did try to buy their own land found themselves constantly coming up against planning laws that routinely discriminated against them. Research conducted in 1997 found that whereas 80 per cent of all planning applications from the settled community were accepted, 90 per cent of gypsy and traveller applications were initially rejected. Even today only 54 per cent of applications are approved and most of those are only on appeal.

I would have loved to have seen Jonjo and possibly Jay sent out on loan for the season to Premiership clubs to get experience. You can see what Bolton have done for Wilshere and Sturridge. My main concern is for Jonjo who will have trouble getting time this season.

Obviously Kelly, Flano, Jack have stood up and played well when called upon. Kelly looks a player doesn't he? If he can keep fit, he will be great, and would give an opportunity for Flano to move out on loan for some first team action. We also have Wilson already in the first team, who I do rate, but not as a left back. 

In the academy setup, we have lots of great prospects. Suso, Coady, Sterling, Wisdom, and Morgan who stick out. Rodolfo and Frank McParland have done a great job with progressing our academy. I think a lot of these players will end up in top leagues in the future.

I cannot recognise this characterisation. I live a mile away from a traveller site (I think there's another one about three miles away) and have never heard a single complaint, nor has a quick scan online thrown up any articles in the local press regarding nuisance, crime etc. 

I think the problems you highlight of poor educational attainment etc., rather than being reasons to condemn and villify them are the very reasons they need to be given a break. In terms of health and education, they are one of the most deprived groups in the Britain.

Life expectancy for Gypsy and Traveller men and women is 10 years lower than the national average.

Gypsy and Traveller mothers are 20 times more likely than the rest of the population to have experienced the death of a child.

In 2003, less than a quarter of Gypsy and Traveller children obtained five GCSEs and A*-C grades, compared to a national average of over half.

The idea that there is something unique about an untidy traveller site can only be made by someone who has had the luck not to live on some of the council estates and tower blocks I have. Living somewhere where people use the lift as a urinal on a daily basis certainly stops you having romantic notions about some percieved moral superiority of the settled community... burned out cars, wrecked sofas chucked of balconies, abandoned dirty nappies - these are the hallmarks of poorly educated people with low aspirations, not of a specific ethnic group.

&gt;This casual acceptance of the word fighting implies that there is this vast group of 'others' who are using some sort of cunning and underhand tactics to gather the resources before anyone else can.

Here in Britain it is fact we go out our way to make things 'as fair as possible'. - This can be seen as being unfair to people who have stayed loyal to the country through out generations and cannot get the same sort of support we give here if 'they' were to emigrate. I've been on the back hand of this, which you may have seen in previous comments. When I was on Jobseekers I had a lot of resentment for those who could barely speak English yet had a job. Fuck it, I'm over that now and have taken in views that my view *was* wrong. However there *is* a problem. I now wouldn't blame it on an immigrant but on our business's and governments who are hoarding ridiculous sums of money. 

&gt;This is why I hate the EDL, because they encourage people to think shortages can be blamed on foreigners rather than inefficiencies in the market and government.

They only encourage people who, as I have found myself, feel isolated. Especially with a huge amount of youngsters now, like me, who have come out of education to end up on JSA. Who then have mothers and father, relatives and friends telling them 'to get off their arse and get a job' - yet there are not enough jobs to go around.

If you travel by bus and have to pay (because you haven't bought a bus pass), use the Magic Busses (they're dark blue). These have the cheapest fares - but only use them between the university campus (ie outside the tin can building) to Fallowfield or you'll end up spending more. You won't need a bike for where you're living.

Your local shop is the Spar opposite HSBC by the BBC. There's also a small Sainsbury's opposite the CornerHouse Theatre which is opposite the Palace Theatre.

Your local Dominos is on Grosvenor Street. There will be a big promotion for personal pizzas when you arrive. Collect a coupon every day and you'll get a free personal sized pizza the following day (only one a day, but they don't really check). Find the quick way to walk to uni which is by crossing the A34 (Upper Brook Street) and going down Grosvenor Street.

Tesco in Shrewsbury operated illegally for 3 years before being granted retrospective planning permission. [Source](http://www.shropshirestar.com/news/2011/06/03/tesco-plans-shrewsbury-expansion-as-whitchurch-backs-sainsburys/)

In fact Tesco seem to do this do this all the time - but somehow they don't attract the same sort of hatred.

John Waite, who investigated the supermarket for Radio 4's Face the Facts, said Tesco ""stand accused of dragging out the planning process, challenging enforcement orders, manipulating the planning laws, bending them, if you like, and breaking them on occasion.""

[Just a few examples of Tesco twisting or flouting planning regulations, reneging on promises, and having no respect for the local community:](http://allanweaver.kindaneat.org/w21/tesco.htm)

 

2/2011 Moreton Cross, Wirral Tesco apply retrospectively to sell alcohol until 11pm, in a well-known crime hotspot.

1/2011 Barnstaple, N Devon The chairman of North Devon Council’s planning committee has accused a major supermarket retailer of attempting to “ride roughshod” over local council planning rules. Cllr Jasmine Chesters spoke as Tesco sought retrospective permission for a raft of “minor changes” they had already made to a brand new superstore being built at Seven Brethren in Barnstaple. The company diverted from the original plans approved in March last year, making some 35 changes including the removal of the petrol station car wash and relocation of kiosk and pumps, as well as alterations to the car parking layout, service yard, doors, fire escapes and roof “windcatchers”. Tesco has also made a number of aesthetic changes to the outside appearance of the building, while inside, a mezzanine floor area has been increased to make room for some of the external plant machinery. “That these changes are retrospect, meaning the work has already been carried out, I find appalling,” she said.

11/2010 Harlescott, Shrewsbury Tesco was in violation of planning rules from the moment the store was built. Tesco stocked an extra 152 sq metres more of goods including clothing, DIY, household and recreational items after it broke planning rules on how much non-grocery space it can have. The store called the transgression “a blunder”.

12/2010 Callington, Cornwall Cornwall Council's planning department said it was in preliminary stages of investigating an alleged breach of planning regulations involving the store's car park.

11/2010 Oldham Local councillors have warned that Tesco cannot open its new store in Chew Valley Road unless it builds industrial units at the site — a condition of planning permission imposed in 2005. But with under a month to go and the units only half built, councillors are doubtful that they will be available for use before the planned opening date of December 6. Saddleworth South councillor Richard Knowles, said: “All Tesco has done is put the steel frame in place. The store will be opening illegally and in breach of planning laws. Tesco are not a law unto themselves.”

4/2009 Luisson Grove, Marlyebone Lorries making deliveries to the Tesco Express are blocking up Lisson Grove during the morning rush hour, despite planning approval for the new shop explicitly banning deliveries on the busy street. And a delivery bay in Hayes Place it was told to widen has actually been filled in.

7/2010 Wavertree, Liverpool Council bosses will take action against Tesco who allowed a mobile phone mast disguised as a flag pole to be put up on the building in breach of planning  laws. It emerged at yesterday’s planning committee that despite not appealing against the decision, the applicants put up the mast anyway.

7/2010 Unthank, Norwich Contractors working for Tesco were found to be in breach of the planning permission by Norwich City Council. The council served a temporary stop notice early yesterday morning. The notice required all work affecting a mature horse chestnut tree on the site to cease to protect it from harm. All further work must be completed in line with the site’s original planning permission. It would be a criminal offence for the terms of the notice to be breached. The notice followed a site visit by planning officers.

6/2010 Kilbirnie After recent complaints regarding the breach of planning consent at the Tesco store, the petrol station is no longer operating 24hrs. The problem regarding the curfew and the breach of planning conditions only came to light when local residents raised objections to the erection of a wind turbine in the Tesco car park.

4/2010 Lerwick, Shetland Laurence Smith of the Town Centre Association said Tesco’s plans went beyond an agreement that the existing 185 sq metres for non-food, or “comparison” goods, would not be increased when the extension was built. “The plans show a serious deviation into the sale of comparison goods,” Mr Smith said. “This is contrary to our understanding of the planning application and the basis on which planning approval was granted.”

12/2009 Northside, Allerdale From the Carlisle news &amp; Star: Tesco vow to open Workington store without planning permission. Work was halted yesterday after it emerged that the supermarket giant did not have Allerdale council’s permission to build the new store opposite Dunmail Park Shopping Centre and it would not be treated as an emergency application and fast-tracked. But after submitting a retrospective application and attending a meeting with Allerdale council, which ended ‘amicably’, Tesco bosses say they will open the store early next week and are hopeful they will get permission.

7/ 2009 Mill Road, Cambridge Tesco has been warned by the Highways Authority, the Planning Inspectorate and Cambridge City Council not to deliver to the front of the store. And 'No Mill Road Tesco' campaigners claim the company will be breaking the law and could face fines of up to £1,000 a day if it goes ahead with the plan. But Tesco confirmed the company would make deliveries in the street.

10/2008 Braunton, North Devon Tesco in Braunton has opened ""illegally"", despite not coming close to meeting the housing quota on the 106 agreement before opening the store. Cllr Chugg said: ""When the store opened last week there were only 17 houses built, three of which are affordable, which is nowhere near what they were supposed to build — but they opened up regardless.

2/2008 Heswall, Wirral Tesco apply for an extension to the hours they are allowed to deliver, asking for lorries to arrive between 6am-11pm, Monday to Saturday and 7am-11pm on Sundays and Bank Holidays.

8/2007 Bury St Edmunds Councillors have refused to grant Tesco retrospective approval for a store extension which was built without planning permission. The council could now force the leading supermarket chain to demolish the extension.

10/2006 Ruthin, Denbighshire Tesco applied to increase its store size by 50% a week after the store had opened. Despite promising to create 300 jobs, it only created 180, many of which were part time.

7/2006  Gerrards Cross Tesco building works collapsed on to a main railway commuter line. 27,000 tonnes of waste from that collapse remains, and it is situated in an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. It has been there a year, despite an order from the council. 

11/2004 Portwood, Stockport, Tesco breached planning regulations by building their store 20% larger than stated. Following pressure from local businesses, the Council demanded in September 2005 that Tesco submit a full retrospective planning application, which it did in December 2005. When it did so, Tesco argued that there were “no sustainable reasons for the refusal of planning permission,” despite the 2003 conditions and Council’s position that the store was “unauthorised.”

Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk Tesco built a bulk storage facility without planning permission.

The connection between the TARDIS and regeneration is there, I believe, so it could be a factor of the TARDIS being shot at the time. I initially thought it was simply just a too powerful poison that not even regenerating would successfully cure him, but perhaps him not being able to was an indicator of something being amiss

The source of the Time Lords' regeneration is a bit tricky because it's somewhat changed (from my understanding) in the Classic Series.  But in the episode, Mawdryn Undead, the source of regeneration is described to be packets in the Time Lord body, one for each life, that enable a Time Lord to regenerate.  In this way it is genetic, but something the Time Lords could bestow to give additional regenerations to a Time Lord (the Doctor is supposed to have only 12 regenerations, although whether that holds remains to be seen).  

These ""regeneration packets"" appear to have some connection to the fact the Time Lords spent billions of years exposed to the Untempered Schism - essentially what the TARDIS did to River - although River isn't a full Time Lord and her process of becoming one was aided by genetic manipulation.  Having said all that, we don't know how fully the Ganger Doctor would have been a Time Lord.  Maybe he would be able to regenerate because it was a part of his genetic makeup?

The doctor is so old and so wise that is a walking Xanatos Gambit, all your plans might as well be as mysterious and chaotic as a rerun of I Love Lucy. He plays chess without moving his pieces because he knows in thirty turns your king is going to be in just the right spot to topple it with a well thrown Clementine.

The reason the Doctor makes for such a great character even though he is so powerful is that he is TERRIFIED of playing any other way. His knowledge, resolve, his fury is so vast that when he does act entire civilizations can be knocked away as Knights and Bishops before he takes revenge on your King. 

So The Doctor plays Janitor to the universe. Cleaning up small spills and simple tasks to keep himself busy. Surrounding himself with people who he has to take care of, people who don't know what he is capable of and can keep him grounded. People who stop him from calling himself Time Lord Victorious.

Humanity might as well be one giant Heat Sink, just the right mix of traits and characters to keep the Doctor just handicapped enough and interested enough to prevent him for causing to much trouble.

That is the true tension for the character, his struggle against himself. Those speeches are the most real thing about his character, an addict trying to forget his past and cope with what he can do. They are no more akin to bond villain speeches then alcoholism is to chewing gum.

Because the moment the Doctor stops trying to trick you, he starts trying to end you. The moment the Doctor stops talking he stops being a man and becomes a vengeful god.

true,Manic_Miner,eng-somerset,Somerset,"&gt; It has been suggested that building on greenbelt land is the smoking gun - I pointed out that the council would have been quite within the law to allow this under the Planning For Gypsy and Traveller Caravan Sites legislation.

Yes, but only if the Sheridans had applied for change-of-use, which they didn't. They had ample opportunity but decided that they'd make a fuss instead.

&gt; It has been suggested that lack of planning permission is the smoking gun - I pointed out that retrospective planning permission is not only acceptable, but frequently granted, even in cases where the party involved has been guilty of numerous similar breaches on a systematic level.

Retrospective planning permission is granted in a few cases but not frequently and even in the Tesco examples you cited above, many are refused or work halted until a compromise is reached. None of this makes it okay to illegally change land usage and construct buildings in the greenbelt, so let's stop pretending it does.

&gt; It has been suggested that the law is even handed - the Tesco example seems to show otherwise. So does the Lakenheath Hall development. So does the Beausale case. 

Lakenheath Hall changed hands, so the local council had to start fresh with a new owner (one who has pledged to cooperate with local concerns). In Beausale, the travellers brought machinery on site and the local council had other plans for the land.

Both of these examples are absolutely irrelevent to Dale Farm, and yet you got upset when someone criticised you for posting random links.

&gt; It's just the real anger and rage and harsh words are saved for the people who are at the bottom of the pile.

Do you know who is really at the bottom of the pile? It's the people whose opinions get ignored and their lives spoiled - the locals.

Funny how your compassion doesn't extend to them...

&gt; People don't get this worked up about just any planning application - I don't see any discussions here where people have seriously suggested putting Tesco executives in camps and their children into care.

Yeah, you tend not to see things when you dont want to see them - [first Google hit](http://notesco.wordpress.com/).

10. In recognition of Scotland’s Christian heritage, non-denominational schools 
are also encouraged to draw upon the rich resources of this tradition when planning 
religious observance.  However, many school communities contain pupils and staff 
from faiths other than Christianity or with no faith commitment, and  this must be 
taken fully into account in  supporting spiritual development.  It is of central 
importance that all pupils and staff can participate with integrity in forms of religious 
observance without compromise to their personal faith.  
11. At present in non-denominational schools, assemblies are the most common 
vehicle for delivering religious observance.  There should be  a clear distinction 
between assemblies devised for the purpose of religious observance and assemblies 
for other purposes such as celebrating success.  The precise form of religious 
observance will be determined by each school’s policy within the local authority’s 
framework, but these might  include opportunities for class, year, stage or whole 
school observance as well as involvement by pupils and others, including school

I've heard that TPTB don't particularly want to encourage the less mature viewers of Doctor Who to watch Torchwood. They're aimed at different audiences, particularly now that Torchwood is airing on Starz and has quite a lot of sex in it (so I've heard).

It could also be the split in production. RTD used to do both Who and Torchwood, now he only does Torchwood. The show is also only *co*-produced by BBC. I don't think Moffat has anything to do with Torchwood. Does he even have time to collaborate with the Torchwood production team?

Aaand, implications on storyline. Perhaps whatever's going on in Torchwood's story would conflict with what Moffat wants happening in his Doctor Who story.

Timing wise it works well because she had to be kidnapped at some point. Think about it:

* The ship is the same one as used by the Silence in TIA.
* The Doctor said in TAP that he thought she had been kidnapped some time before they went to America.
* The Tardis simply ""took off"" with Amy and The Doctor is *forcefully* ejected. Never explained. But a perfect opportunity to kidnap Amy as she was isolated from any witnesses.
* At 21:49 of The Lodger she is very obviously gasping in surprise at something and she starts to yell at someone at 21:54 - and then immediately forgets about it.

Edit: As pointed out by multiple people (in AGMGTW at 33:52 to be precise) The Doctor said that the first time they were together in this version of reality was their wedding night. So the kidnapping has to happen between The Big Bang and TIA, not during The Lodger.

true,Grindlebone,null,null,"OK, I think I might have the answer to to who and WHY Madame Kovarian exists. She is River Song, and she's using a perception filter to appear to be someone else, for a couple of reasons.

First, she's making sure all the things that must happen to her younger self occur correctly and in order, so that any paradox is avoided. She's making sure her personal history goes to plan.

Second, by taking the steps needed to keep her history intact, River would appear, to an outside observer, to absolutely hate the Doctor. Who better for the Silence to work with than someone who appears prepared to go to any extreme, kidnapping a pregnant woman and later a child, turning said child into a living weapon against the Doctor, striking at the Doctor through his friends, and so on, in the war against the last Time Lord. Who better to bring into the fight, than one who seems to hate your enemy even more than you do?

But River is actually using her history to fool the Silence into letting her into the top echelon of their organization, so that when the Doctor finally goes head-to-head with them, he'll have a hidden ally on the inside. She's the Doctor's fifth column in the enemy camp.

She's also convincing the Silence that the Doctor's weak point is his friends, where, in truth, his companions are all strong, tough people who are more than ready to do what they need to to support him. The Silence will assume that, separated from the Doctor, Amy and Rory are no problem to deal with. They'll be shocked when the Girl Who Waited and the Last Centurion start to hand the Silence their asses.

I understand and have sympathy, but the people who treat soldiers with most contempt are the organisations (I can't strictly say countries anymore - NATO etc) they represent. I know people in the forces and people who would like to be and I explain my position the same as I just did before and I don't think that moral challenge is as disrespectful, so to speak, as the way they are treated before, during and after service. 

As you say, we have limited ability to stop wars (whilst there are people willing to fight them), which is why I feel compelled to speak to people about it on certain occasions. If nothing else to give them a different perspective and to reinforce their enabling of wars that most of them don't really agree with in the first place. 

There are scales of complicity no doubt, without access to information it is impossible to make informed judgments. Child soldiers, soldiers of regimes who can control information and education to people with little job prospects etc. The latter of which though I don't really, I have sympathy, but if I am unemployed I am still unwilling to kill people for money. I don't agree that they are all heroes, many are mercenaries who would fight for whetever country they were born into out of blind patriotism, and they are paid. No doubt there are heroic soldiers, but they are already compromised in my eyes. 

I believe war is a paradigm we need to get through, with education and information the key to it. We're increasingly seeing the automation and mechanisation of the military anyway so we'll see how much longer they even need large armies. Finally, I can't find the exact quote but i'd agree that standing armies are one of the biggest dangers we can encounter if we want to prosper. If we had conscription here they wouldn't have been able to go to war in Iraq, Afghanistan or Libya. 

I am not only a pacifist but a militant pacifist. I am willing to fight for peace. Nothing will end war unless the people themselves refuse to go to war - Einstein.

What you propose sounds good, but we have to deal with the reality we find ourselves in today, not what could be in a century or so (and most likely after some nasty wars and offensive geo-politics). So we need to develop an immigration and more importantly a naturalization process that allows immigration where it's needed, but prevents serious social or economic problems. 

(I'll also point out that capitalist outsourcing is actually doing more to spread the wealth about than to prevent it.

There were sets that looked like brick but shook like canvas when the door was slammed.

The main difference is it actually showed BBC shows instead of ""Star Trek the Next Generation."")  Although I didn't understand at the time, I think the reason I fell in love was because it took itself seriously.  It wasn't tongue in cheek, it was telling an ambitious story within a tiny budget.

I think you're understating it a little there. The vast majority of the software spend for large enterprises is _not_ off-the-shelf applications, it's customized business systems. Vendors will very develop new features (or remove them!) and otherwise customise their offering for a specific client as part of winning the contract. I work for a company that does just that.

Open source has no incentive to go to those lengths. No salespeople to negotiate such contracts, no money dependent on it, etc. They won't do it.

Now, there are a growing number of vendors who will use open source components in developing these types of business systems, but they're still developing a proprietary solution. If they actually modify the open source code, their patches are unlikely to be of much use to anyone else anyway. Of course, they do report bugs and even contribute fixes.

And in these kind of situations, like OP has asked, why the hell wouldn't the Doctor be stepping in to save the day?  Earth is basically his pet playground planet across time, so if the threat was actually serious, he would certainly be there to help solve it.  Because he's not, the audience can then conclude that the danger isn't actually that bad, and thus the tension is weakened.  Whereas with the smaller threats, there's no need for the Doctor to intervene, but the tension, the danger is still there for the characters because they are the ones sticking their necks out to clean up.

In addition, the long-arc format pulls the focus away from the characters because everything is about TWIST after TWIST after TWIST.  It's all too exhausting to be enjoyable.",0,1315337751,null,0,false,0,c2hwry2,t3_k6ise,t1_c2hwry2,t1_c2hwd84,1427566093,4,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,4

""Arabic names won't go into English exactly, for their consonants are not the same as ours, and their vowels, like ours vary from district to district. There are some 'scientific systems' of transliteration, helpful to people who know enough Arabic not to need helping, but a wash-out for the world.

true,literallyoverthemoon,eccleston,Eccleston,"Firstly, it is important to (briefly) outline the mechanisms with which both machines achieve time travel.

When a Tardis is travelling through time, it is actually moving through the Time Vortex, entering and exiting at the desired destinations, and is not within normal spacetime.

The Delorean uses Flux Dispersal to instantaneously leave one designated time and arrive in another, while remaining stationary in space.

Now, it may appear reasonable that a Delorean travelling between two points in time while within a Tardis moving through the Time Vortex would arrive at spatial coordinates within the Vortex, but at temporal coordinates at which the Tardis has passed or is yet to reach.

However, normal laws of physics do not apply within the Time Vortex, and it exists outwith time itself, therefore it would not be possible to program into a DeLorean temporal coordinates with respect to the Time Vortex, as none exist within it. Similarly, it can be assumed that no spatial coordinates could exist within the Vortex.

Therefore the only reference frame within which a Delorean could traverse in this system is that of the Tardis itself.

Travel within the Tardis' own timeline would be possible, so long as certain problems do not present themselves. For instance, if sections of the Tardis were to be moved, duplicated, or even deleted, the DeLorean could arrive split between two or more sets of coordinates, within two or more simultaneously, or may not arrive at all. Successful traversal may also depend on the nature of the Tardis' timeline, and whether it is fixed or in Flux; if in flux, the DeLorean would be incapable of Flux dispersal. Alteration of wibbly, wobbly, timey, and/or wimey parameters/controls may be necessary.

Travel within a Tardis' timeline would only be possible while an external reference frame is unavailable, i.e. when within the Time vortex. Any attempt to reach 88mph while the Tardis/DeLorean system exists within a reference frame with both termporal and spatial coordinates outwith the Tardis interior, would result in the outcome mentioned at the start of this answer; arrival before or after the Tardis existed at designated temporal coordinates.

This does not however forbid the arrival of a Delorean within a Tardis which is not within the Time Vortex, as the reference frame during Flux Dispersal would remain that of the Tardis.

In conclusion, a DeLorean within a Tardis could travel along the reference frame of the Tardis' timeline, but only while the Tardis exists within the Time Vortex (outwith spacetime), and assuming certain conditions.

At 1996s, the Justice captain says they're after her because ""according to our records, the woman who kills the Doctor"", then goes on to explain that they're time travelling justices after criminals.

Sorry to be blunt about it, but what you say is not true. It's only their database screen that says the TARDIS is stolen. The Justices are after River the War Criminal for her act of killing the Doctor.

River, by the way, hasn't stolen the TARDIS. Even in the episode, the TARDIS authorised and taught her. So, the only people with **any** right to call the TARDIS ""stolen"" are the Time Lords, up to when they were depicted *back in the 1970s when Jon Pertwee was the Doctor*.

true,zombieCyborg,cyberman,Cyberperson,"Glad to see new people getting into the show, welcome aboard. Well, some have been addressed, but here is my take (I will try to not repeat whats already been said, just summarize):

* Some episodes will have references to things done on ""vacation-style"" outings. The show mostly just shows the dramatic/entertaining encounters  and/or those that impact the overall story.
* It has been said before in the thread, but the TARDIS has consciousness that will (according to Moffat/Gaiman) take the doctor where he *needs* to go, occasionally, this may be the same as that vacation he *wanted*. 

* He picks adventurers as companions, people that are likely to enjoy the fun as much as him. That said, the fact that he is not only a danger to them, but he also makes them a danger to themselves by emulating him, is covered in some dialog. He does worry, but he is smart, and doesn't betray his weakness too much.
* For the above reasons, it is hard to tell when the Doctor is genuinely surprised when things go awry, or if he meant for this to happen. Rule one: the Doctor lies (Moffat again).

*I realize I am answering as Moffat would, I would love to hear some views from the perspective of previous incarnations of the show (i.e. Baker's Doctor).*",0,1315359393,null,0,false,0,c2hzc16,t3_k6x7e,t1_c2hzc16,t3_k6x7e,1427567293,5,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,5

Of course, I naturally didn't expect you to simply concede the point, and you're probably right that I couldn't easily get you to concede it with rhetoric (even with my flowery oratory!) but I think it's actually an evidence-based point.  It's perfectly reasonable to view the communism implemented as a failure, even to argue that it could never succeed, but it's not reasonable to call the system that they implemented [socialism](http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/socialism) because the means of production etc. were owned and controlled not in common or by the community as a whole but by a political party/class (the Bolsheviks) supposedly 'on behalf' of the people.  Such a system, where the means of production etc. are owned and the surplus is controlled and distributed by a particular class is called capitalism.  In the case of the USSR the State acted as the ruling class, thus State capitalism.

&gt;What you propose sounds good, but we have to deal with the reality we find ourselves in today, not what could be in a century or so

I like your optimism!  And yes, I agree, this is why I say I'm a pragmatist on issues like immigration.

&gt;in the BRIC nations conditions are actually getting better.

Certainly for some.

&gt;I hear people talking about a global collapse that capitalism will surely bring, but then I remember that Asia isn't actually doing anywhere near as bad as the West these days

Believe me, as you know I've watched this first hand, at close quarters, ""ab initio"", and it's a (very) mixed blessing.  There's no doubt that there's more money floating around, too much one might argue, with transnational corporations having vastly too much influence.  Consider how much power they exert in the West given the relative wealth of Western governments, and you can imagine the kind of power they can exert in this part of the world where governments are considerably less wealthy and less able to resist their demands.  The influence of Western transnational policy and economic outfits like the World Bank and WTO is also pervasive, pernicious and corrosive.

There's no doubt that initially lending and inward investment was welcomed enthusiastically and appeared to be broadly beneficial, expanding an urban middle class and providing people with a much wider range of branded goods and electronic toys on which to spend earnings and squirrelled away resources.  Of course, in large part, this was a consequence of the removal of trade embargoes and barriers, as well as the renegotiation of existing debt and the arrangement of new debt (often on a highly locally unfavourable basis in an extremely one-sided, even corrupt, manner).

At the time, I observed to friends that they were mistaking money for wealth and it would be an interesting (too much in the Chinese sense) experiment to observe the impact on quality of life.  What has happened has been the evolution of economies with a disturbing tendency to overheat, too much intertwined with Western debt structures, rapidly rising commercial and domestic rents, the driving out of a huge percentage of small local businesses and consequently, the driving into corporate employment of a large percentage of small business people and those who were previously supported within an extended family business context.  Productivity has increased, but the family situation and overall economic position of many has deteriorated.

Long story short, it may well be that the overall economic position of developing countries compared to the West has improved, but too often the inequalities in-country have substantially increased, with all the associated economic and social problems that brings.",0,1315370075,null,0,true,0,c2i0nzb,t3_k69a0,t1_c2i0nzb,t1_c2hw8sx,1427567992,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

Children - Sarah Jane Adventures

Family - Doctor Who

Adult - Torchwood.

You can see this in the themes and stories of both. Adult themes appear in Torchwood and DW, but in DW they are subtle, simplified, or guarded enough to be appropriate for children. Children's themes are included in both DW and SJA, but are supplemented or deconstructed more viciously or thoroughly in DW. SJA is defined by its conscious exclusion of adult content and TW is defined by its conscious inclusion of adult content. DW is defined by its exclusion of that which is believed harmful to children, but its inclusion of as much adult material as possible that is not. 

tldr it doesn't have to be aimed at adults OR children, it can be aimed at just about everyone.

true,DogBotherer,null,null,"&gt;I understand and have sympathy, but the people who treat soldiers with most contempt are the organisations (I can't strictly say countries anymore - NATO etc) they represent.

I think you and I, and probably at least partly Ivashkin, agree on that.  Pacifists and conscientious objectors are quite within their rights to present their moral case, just as non-pacifists are to observe that they wouldn't have the luxury to do so if some weren't prepared to defend them, occasionally with force (for the record, I'm not implying any of the current crop of wars, nor any in recent times, have genuinely been defensive wars, nor am I implying pacifists necessarily ever ask to be defended with force).

&gt;I believe war is a paradigm we need to get through, with education and information the key to it. 

Chris Hedges had a lot of interesting stuff to say on this in ['War Is A Force Which Gives Us Meaning'](http://www.thirdworldtraveler.com/War_Peace/War_Gives_Meaning.html).

&gt;We're increasingly seeing the automation and mechanisation of the military anyway so we'll see how much longer they even need large armies.

Indeed, this is a disturbing path.

&gt;Finally, I can't find the exact quote but i'd agree that standing armies are one of the biggest dangers we can encounter if we want to prosper.

Originally, by the anarchist Voltairine de Cleyre - ""A standing army is a standing menace to liberty.""  Eisenhower's farewell speech expanded the point with reference to the dangers of the MIC and also highlighted the difficulties presented by modern society where raising an army from scratch, even for pure defence, seems no longer a realistic option.

&gt;If we had conscription here they wouldn't have been able to go to war in Iraq, Afghanistan or Libya.

It'd've certainly been far harder for the Department of Propaganda to pull off!

true,brown_felt_hat,eccleston,Eccleston,"Ok.  Here's a pretentious list of shows that I like.  You can try them, you don't have to, I just think they're really good.

Game of Thrones - Epic fantasy, and not spell shootin' sissy elf shit.  Political intrigue, brutal bloody way, people actually DYING.  It's awesome.

Dexter - A souless serial killer who kills only murderers after making them regret their deeds.  Oh, did I mention his dad was a cop, his sister is a cop, and he's a cop?  Good stuff.

Breaking Bad - Nobel prize winner hates his dead end life as a high school chem teacher.  He gets cancer.  He begins making ultra-high grade meth to support his family after he dies.  Hilarity ensues.  By hilarity, I mean bad mojo jojo.

Spaced - British comedy.  One of Simon Pegg's first ever things, and Nick Frost's first acting role.  Only 2 seasons, and from the nineties, but utterly hilarious.

Community - A sitcom.  A bunch of (nuerotic) adults form a study group at a completely insane community college.  Hilarity ensues (for real this time)

Yep, this is what I'm watching.  The only thing that REALLY holds a torch to Doctor Who in terms of just straight up good watching is Breaking Bad (Which is the best show on American TV imo), but the others are quite good too, if you're anything like me (which you just may be)",0,1315377782,null,0,false,0,c2i1fps,t3_k77mq,t1_c2i1fps,t3_k77mq,1427568354,36,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,36

true,[deleted],null,null,"I don't think you quite understand. This is the list of people that signed the letter published in the Financial Times today calling on the government to ditch the 50% tax rate. The letter this BBC News article is about.

The logic is simple. The 50% tax rate is and always has been a **temporary measure**. Neither Labour nor the Conservatives plan on making it a permanent fixture of the tax regime.

Yet, these economists argue, the tax is having **lasting effects**. In their own words, it ""gives the UK one of the highest personal tax regimes in the industrialised world, making it less competitive internationally and making us less attractive as a destination for both foreign investment and talented workers.""

""The UK has already slipped from second to fourth place as a destination for inward investment. It punishes wealth creation by imposing on entrepreneurs and business people a marginal tax rate in excess of 50 per cent once national insurance contributions are added in.""

How many high-tech startups has the UK had in the past five years? Off the top of my head I think I could count them all on one hand, but look over to the US and the startup scene there is booming. Innovation, investment, growth. Exactly what the UK economy needs right now.

It's easy to see how the *temporary* boost to government revenue provided by the 50% rate can be cancelled out, if not in the short term, most definitely in the long term, by: 

a) high earners deciding to relocate themselves to more competitive tax regimes, losing all tax revenue from them completely;

true,Pyrix,english,Reading,"I understand where the names have come from but they have simply made statements about how bad it is rather than providing any evidence of their claims. Most of them are probably just defending their own economic ideology rather than a pragmatic look at whether the tax rate should exist.

Just because it was designed as a temporary measure doesn't mean I can't think it should be permanent, and the argument is about how soon the Tories repeal it.

The slipping of the UK as a place for investment, as well as lack of high-tech startups is not a long term problem created solely by the 50% rate, but rather mainly a result of the financial crisis. Scandinavia, for example, has many successful and 'high-tech' companies (Nokia, Ericsson, Volvo, Scania) but most Scandinavian countries have top rates of tax approaching 60%. Also, it depends what you mean by high-tech, since stuff like IT/Software companies are doing very well in the UK. The video games industry now brings in more than the film industry. The M4 Corridor near where I live remains a centre of 'high-tech' industry (and footloose too, meaning they can move easily); yet they didn't all leave when the 50% rate was introduced.  

I've already mentioned Scandinavia, but that's the best example to show how despite high rates of tax, those countries have continued to do well economically and produce many of these 'high-tech startups' you refer to. Those tax rates have been in place for a long time and by your logic all of the 'wealth creators' would have left by now.

&gt; There is little evidence (until the Treasury’s study is completed) to support either argument.

&gt; I’ve written this all from the top of my head so please call me out if I have missed any details or misunderstood something.

&gt; Hasn’t the actual revenue from the 50p tax rate come in at a third (£2bn instead of £7bn?) of what was expected? The Treasury based its original revenue projections based on income information they have collected and held for years.

&gt; This means that a lot of the would-be 50p tax revenue (based on those projections) has already disappeared, been shuffled, restructured or simply left the country. Not the end of the world, though, because we still raised £2bn from it.

&gt; However, if people resident and rooted in this country (as rooted as the top 1% of earners can be, which is to say not very) have managed to achieve a shuffling of most of the 50p taxable income, what are we missing out on? Who has decided not to set up a satellite business or hedge fund in the UK? Who has decided not to take early retirement in a plush London pent house and spend all their money in our shops? Who has decided to do it anyway, but chosen to use expensive international advice and facilities to make sure they don’t pay the tax?

&gt; This is the part that is hard to quantify and impossible to do so accurately. However, for me, the indicator (£7bn/£2bn discrepancy) is that we’re missing out.

&gt; I await the Treasury study in eager anticipation. Unfortunately, it is hard to have a rational debate about this. I get the feeling that most of the 99% who don’t pay the 50p tax would like it in place even if it hurts everyone else in the long-run, because it makes them feel warm and fuzzy.""",0,1315394001,null,0,false,0,c2i2ap8,t3_k7fj5,t1_c2i2ap8,t3_k7fj5,1427568762,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

Absolutely, they leech of the product of the workers without contributing anything themselves.

I'm willing to bet in many cases the amount lost to shareholders and landowners is far higher than 50%, and this is not just on the top marginal income.

I would agree, but I think those earning 200k have rarely done anything to deserve it. I mean, can you really look at your work and say they work 5-10 times harder? 

Usually it derives from property ownership, and I don't think that should be compensated for it is not related to the effort or labour of the individual, it's not like rewarding property ownership will make us any more productive or work harder, because it is simply a result of inheritance.

Before you edited your post, you claimed I had provided the list with no evidence that they supported the argument in question.

&gt; Just because it was designed as a temporary measure doesn't mean I can't think it should be permanent, and the argument is about how soon the Tories repeal it.

It's a temporary measure that is providing a temporary boost to tax revenues, but is harming the UK economy in the long run. Proponents of maintaining the tax rate are: a) glossing over the fact the tax rate was always intended as a temporary measure, and b) basing their arguments on the short-term, with the usual bullshit about how we shouldn't be reducing taxes (back down to vaguely competitive levels) on the highest earners while the lowest earners are suffering in the recession.

Once again the left are being short-sighted. In a time when you want to foster growth, investment and innovation, the *last* thing you want to do is tax individuals and corporations to the hilt.

&gt; The slipping of the UK as a place for investment, as well as lack of high-tech startups is not a long term problem created solely by the 50% rate, but rather mainly a result of the financial crisis. 

Rubbish. The UK wasn't the only country hit by the financial crisis.

&gt; Also, it depends what you mean by high-tech, since stuff like IT/Software companies are doing very well in the UK. The video games industry now brings in more than the film industry. The M4 Corridor near where I live remains a centre of 'high-tech' industry (and footloose too, meaning they can move easily); yet they didn't all leave when the 50% rate was introduced.

I was referring specifically to high-tech *startups*. The point is not about existing, established businesses continuing to do what they do. Video games companies can't just up sticks and move their operations, and accompanying skilled workforce, to another country on a whim.

It's about the highly mobile innovators, and the investment and jobs that follow them, that see the UK, quite rightly, as an absolute dead end for innovation.

true,Pyrix,english,Reading,"Our corporate tax rate is NOT one of the highest in the world, it was already one of the lowest in Europe when Osborne lowered it. It is lower than Germany, France, Italy, Brazil, Japan and India, to name but a few. India and Brazil have seen significant economic growth with those tax rates in the last decade. Similarly, I'll point you again to Scandinavia which has much higher personal tax rates (again, we are not the highest) and indeed you seemed to ignore my Scandinavia point.

I apologise for my initial statement about not providing a source, I jumped into replying before reading the article. I edited my post before your first reply was posted. 

You said that the 'last thing you want to do is tax individuals and corporations to the hilt' but as I've already said, our corporation tax is actually very low compared to many other countries. There are more wealth creators than just the rich earners who get taxed 50% (such as consumption amongst the wider population and government spending). I would argue the last thing you want to do when you want to foster growth is slash government spending, and, since we've seen growth fall from the level of 1.4% seen when Labour's economic recovery plan was in place, that would seem to be correct.

Of course the UK wasn't the only country hit, but I would imagine you see similar trends for startups in most (I admit, not all, since you suggested the US, although I would like to see the source for that) of the countries hit because it just makes sense that startups would fall during a financial crisis. The 50% tax rate is not to blame for any fall in startups. Besides, startups aren't everything because as long as existing companies continue to grow, and wish to be based, in the UK, it is clear that the UK remains competitive, and again, companies aren't the only thing which provide growth.

On the temporary point, as I've already said, just because initially it was stated to be temporary, doesn't somehow mean I can't argue we should have it all the time, and that if Osborne wants to repeal it, he should keep it as long as possible. I've already said above how it doesn't stop growth, investment and innovation, but it does go some way (but not far enough) to ensure that the burden of paying off the deficit is on the shoulders of those who are best placed to pay and improving income equality. The tax as a redistributive/equality promoting tool is another aspect I have not really touched upon, but is incredibly important. I suggest you see The Spirit Level by Wilkinson and Pickett.

To answer your question, there are a huge number of different paths to a high income. 

Innovation is one of them; doing something that has never been done before, usually accompanied by doing it well. Look at Mark Zuckerburg; he innovated in the online social networking industry, executed it very well, now he is extremely wealthy.

Developing a talent and becoming incredibly experienced in an area of business where there is a demand for such experience, and few other people have it, is another. The less competition there is to gain a position, the higher the salary you can command.

There's plain old hard work; many of the people earning more than £150k do so towards the end of their careers, having climbed the ladder over a number of decades. Most people don't just fall into having a £150k salary without putting an awful lot of groundwork in first.

There's also responsibility; many of those with the highest salaries, such as high-level executives, are compensated not only for their managerial expertise and experience, but for taking on vast responsibilities. If you take over as CEO of a company, the performance of that company is ultimately your responsibility, and that is a big task.

The 40% and 50% tax brackets are on money earned ABOVE the minimum. So for example:    

 - 60K income = (35K @ 20% = 7K) + (25K @ 40% = 10K) = 17K tax 
 - 35K income = (35K @ 20% = 7K) = 7K tax 
 - 160K income = (35K @ 20% = 7K) + (115K @ 40% = 46K) + (10K @ 50% = 5K) = 58K

You, and a lot of people, seem to think that once you start earning over 35K that immediately every penny you earn is taxed at the 40% rate, when in fact that is not the case. Tax in the currently system is extremely gradual.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt; In fact it would be interesting to do a comparison of the amount you take home in the UK following tax deductions compared to some other top nations to see if there is a point where it becomes more profitable to move abroad. I very much doubt there is a cross over point.

You doubt there is a cross-over point?

Let's say your income is £200k. In the UK (ignoring tax allowances and deductions for now) you take home £114k after NI and income tax.

At the current abysmal exchange rate, £200k is $320k. Move to one of the states in the US with no state income tax (Texas, Florida, New Hampshire, etc.), and after the federal income tax (again ignoring allowances and deductions) you take home $230k, or £143k.

So there's a good £30k difference there. Even after health insurance, property taxes, even state income taxes, your disposable income would still be higher in the US. Then combine that with a significantly lower cost — and arguably vastly higher quality — of living, and it's a done deal.

The proposition becomes more attractive as your income increases. At £500k/$800k, you're looking at £260k vs. $543k (£340k).

Not really.

This is your problem here. You seem to have this deep-set hatred of success, rooted in jealousy. What on *earth* leads you to think you are correct in describing everyone earning more than £150k as ""the greediest and most immoral shitehawks ever to walk this planet""? 

I'm not sure I can even express in words quite how crass that comment is.

&gt; I think destroying the oppressive mechanism that keep these 'highest earners' in their privileged positions would go a long way to re-distributing the wealth of this planet.

So take the income that people have worked hard for, that they have often made innumerable personal sacrifices to achieve, and the privileges that it rightly confers on them, and hand it out to people who have done absolutely nothing to deserve privileges? Often people who haven't worked a day in their lives?

Also, you could argue that the exposed carpet rails are a trip or other health hazard, which would also fall under the responsibility of the landlord.

I just don't buy that breaking the rate back down to 40% from 50% for earnings over £150k makes it more beneficial to work and live in this country compared to another country.

The short answer is that not everyone is able to. However, those that *are* able tend to be the higher earners — precisely because there are certain costs involved in moving from one country to another. Look at all the British celebrities, actors, musicians, footballers, etc. who have upped sticks and moved to the States over the past decade. Look at all the banks, hedge funds, etc. that have moved their operations to Singapore.

Think about it. If you were given a $1m angel investment to build an online startup, and you had no strong ties to any particular country, where would you go to set up shop? 

If it were me, the UK wouldn't even feature in the top ten. High living costs, absurd property prices, high operating costs (Internet connectivity, utilities, etc.), not a great deal of likeminded individuals and businesses, and if I make a lot of money out of my business, after National Insurance, more than half of my income can easily go down the drain as tax.

Well, clearly it struck a chord, don't you think? Let me make it simple for you:

* You are part of the 99% described
* *Most* of the 99% described have certain qualities
* that is necessary but not *sufficient* to imply that all of the 99% have those qualities
* no sufficient evidence - you ascribed a faulty implication

and then you continue to do this for two more posts. You do realise that statistical likelihood does not guarantee prejudice, don't you?

For a hasty conclusion I would have to actually *draw a conclusion from something* - this does not apply to a proposition, because they are not arguments. If you believe it to be a conclusion generated from the 'ask your average man' phrase - tell me, what does that phrase actually assert? How can it be a premise for anything? If it is not a premise, the second paragraph cannot be an argument as it has no premises to draw from, therefore it cannot be fallacious.

A straw man would require you to have a coherent position from which I can make a straw man argument. But even if you did, I fail to see how I misrepresent your position in any way:

* OP made a generalisation
* You were offended by said generalisation
* You are the target of the generalisation
* I believe generalisations like that are not offensive to anybody
* **Conclusion** I believe you were offended because you were the target of the generalisation

true,otterdam,cnty-uk,Lahndahn,"Nobody said it was consistent :) I'm sure I would hear them retort ""well the little guys deserve a break since they can't afford fancy accountants"".

What I personally find abhorrent is all the money paid to financial services firms (PwC, Deloitte and the like) just to avoid paying even more money to the government. Simplify the tax code so that any chartered accountant could know it all by heart, demand less tax, then the money currently going to the Big Four will go straight to government instead.

(""but they employ lots of people! you'll make them unemployed and the government will collect less income tax!"") - bollocks. Businesses will only pay the auditor (tax liability - tax liability after loopholes). if they pay them any more, it would be cheaper to send HMRC the money they asked for in the first place. The auditors are basically extracting money from the tax that *would* go to the government normally. Their income tax is a fraction of the money they extract. So if they lose their jobs due to decreased domestic demand it would be a net positive for the country. (This is independent of international demand, of course - we will still continue to export our financial services.)

The government needs to reduce the above equation by both closing loopholes and reducing liabilities to a point where auditors cannot save a business more money than they are getting paid, i.e. they are no longer cost effective. And you have to reduce liabilities because the threat of a company moving their operations is genuine, there's no point demanding £100 in tax if business is only paying £40 to both auditors and HMRC as you could end up getting none of it.

&gt;The 50p tax rate will raise a relatively small amount for the taxman, and history has shown us that lowering taxes can boost or even double revenues – because the rich won’t go to such extremes to dodge them.

&gt; We have no way of knowing how many people have left, or will leave, the UK purely because of the 50p tax.

&gt; But we do know that the money coming in has dropped. The number of foreign investment projects pumping money into Britain dropped by 11 per cent during 2010/11. And this cut the number of jobs created by a fifth, according to UK Trade and Investment.

&gt; As the economists’ letter to the FT pointed out, Britain has slipped from second to fourth place as a destination for inward investment.

&gt; Mr Osborne said last month he didn’t see the tax lasting because it’s “very uncompetitive internationally, and people, frankly, can move”.

&gt; He’s right; in which case stalling the decision must be because of the politics.

&gt; For as Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls said today: “Millions of struggling families and pensioners on middle and low incomes will wonder why the only tax rise or spending cut George Osborne is willing to reconsider is the top rate of tax for the very richest.”",0,1315419526,null,0,false,0,c2i53gf,t3_k7fj5,t1_c2i53gf,t3_k7fj5,1427570080,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

&lt;rambling&gt;

&gt;here are now so many graduates a degree is nigh on worthless.

I think it depends on how you view it. For an individual a degree no longer gives them the same competitive advantage over their peers (as they all also have degrees). All else being equal, the more people that gain degrees the less that an individual degree is worth. 

However living in a country with a large, educated workforce would seem advantageous for business, science, pretty much everything. 

To me your post highlights the reasons that higher education should be free. The advantage to the individual varies, and introducing a negative factor (a cost) may reduce the percentage that choose higher education. An individuals investment may not have a suitable risk to reward return. However there is a long-term advantage to the state, which makes it a sensible investment for public funding. 

I would also like to see how levels of ""entrepreneurship"" are affected by student debt. I would imagine that having no prior overheads would have a positive impact on the number of startups, as students fresh out of university would have less temptation to find a reliable job. Pure conjecture, but something I will look into.

But even past the audios I love 6 on tv as well.  For just one amazing incarnation we got a doctor who wasn't ashamed to admit he was the smartest man in the room, and tell people just what he thought of them.  After the super passive 5 this was an even more welcome change.  Trial of a time lord as a whole is one of the most epic and risky stories the show has ever done in it's entire history in any medium.  And mark of the rani, revelation of the daleks, and the two doctors are all personal favorites as well.   I will never get the hate for his tv era, but then again I dint think the twin dilemma is that bad even so I must be crazy.

And as for the outfit, while I admit I hated it at first as well I love it now.  This is the doctor that doesn't care what others think, HE likes the jacket and that's all that matters to him.

true,TabascoAtWork,null,null,"xiaodown covered it pretty well, but I'll answer your other question:

Series 1 of *Torchwood* takes place in between Series 2 and 3 of *Doctor Who* (or during Series 3).  Just make sure that you start it after you finish Series 2 of DW, and finish the *Torchwood* season before you watch the DW episode ""Utopia"" (series 3, episode 11), which is where Jack comes back into DW.

Series 2 of *Torchwood* takes place during Series 4 of *Doctor Who*.  Make sure you watch up to the TW episode ""A Day in the Death"" (last part of a 3-episode arc with Martha) before you get to the DW episode ""The Sontaran Stratagem""/""The Poison Sky.""  Finally, make sure you finish Series 2 of *Torchwood* before you get to the DW Series 4 episode ""The Stolen Earth""/""Journey's End.""

Finally, Series 3 of *Torchwood* (aka *Torchwood: Children of Earth*) takes place at some point during the Specials between Series 4 and 5 of *Doctor Who*.  Just make sure you watch it at some point between ""Journey's End"" (DW S4 finale) and ""The End of Time"" (the last of the 2008-2010 Specials, aka Tennant's last episode).

Series 4 of *Torchwood* (aka *Torchwood: Miracle Day*) takes place sometime after *Children of Earth*/Series 3, but doesn't have any real connection with any season of *Doctor Who*, so just watch it after you finish DW's ""The End of Time.""

Since that's a lot of text, hopefully this list will help:

- *Doctor Who* Series 1
- *Doctor Who* Series 2
- *Torchwood* Series 1 (can be watched with DW Series 3, but you need to finish it before DW season 3 eipsode 11)
- *Doctor Who* Series 3
- *Torchwood* Series 2 (episodes 1-8)
- *Doctor Who* Series 4 (episodes 1-5)
- *Torchwood* Series 2 (episodes 9-13)
- *Doctor Who* Series 4 (episodes 6-13)
- *Doctor Who* ""The Next Doctor
- *Doctor Who* ""Planet of the Dead""
- *Torchwood* Series 3 *Children of Earth* (this can go anywhere between DW Series 4 and DW ""The End of Time"")
- *Doctor Who* ""The Waters of Mars""
- *Doctor Who* ""The End of Time""
- *Doctor Who* Series 5
- *Torchwood* Series 4 *Miracle Day* (This can go anywhere after DW ""The End of Time"")
- *Doctor Who* Series 6

Please note that you do *not* need to watch *Torchwood* to get the full *Doctor Who* experience.  I didn't watch any of it until I'd seen every 2005-present DW episode.

true,CurseThoseFourKnocks,tennant,Tennant,"I personally enjoyed it, but if what you are looking for is a direct tie into Doctor Who, you won't get very much of it. Jack will make occasional references and some of the Torchwood team make brief cameos on Doctor Who, but the Doctor does not appear in any TW episodes. However, there is one Doctor Who character (besides Jack) who does make an appearance in a few episodes of TW.  The one thing you will get from it is several looks into Jack's background before he met the Doctor. 

On its own merit, the first two series are okay to good and the 3rd mini-series (Children of Earth) was very dark but by far the pinnacle of the series. This most recent series on Stars has been disappointing. Torchwood definitely has a darker, grittier feeling to it and is definitely aimed at primarily adults.

As far as a rough watching order, TW series one can be watched after Series 2 of Doctor Who. Series 2 of TW will make the most sense after you finish Series 3 of Doctor Who. The Children of Earth Mini-Series fits in well pretty much any time after Series 4 of Doctor Who.  TW: Miracle Day can be watched anytime after this as it is almost completely separated from Doctor Who.

If you are looking for something more in the Doctor Who spirit, I would suggest the Sarah Jane Adventures. It is aimed a bit more towards kids, but still has many episodes enjoyable by adults. It also has appearances by the Doctor and ties into Doctor Who a bit more often. ",0,1315429760,null,0,false,0,c2i6mes,t3_k7xa9,t1_c2i6mes,t3_k7xa9,1427570812,4,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,4

true,widgetas,null,null,"What's the conflict of interest exactly? Before you answer I'll warn you not to follow the Dorries line that abortion providers, Marie Stopes etc, are profit driven. MS is a charity, for one thing.

Consider this - not a great analogy but it might give you some idea of where Dorries is coming from: I have just broken my leg. I need to get it fixed but there's a lot of people out there with different ideas of how broken legs should be treated. Now I could go to the GP and he/she will more than likely point me towards a hospital. Hospitals get tax payers money and fix broken legs if you want them done. It's *very* unlikely the hospital will say I'd be better off not getting it fixed by them. You could say that it's in their interest to fix my broken leg.

But I've heard about other groups who think that a splint and herbal tea is right, while other people want to pray for broken legs, saying that the power of prayer will fix it.

Along comes an MP who thinks it's not right that hospitals are giving people advice on how to mend broken legs, as they get money for it and so they're not likely to tell people to do something else. And there are lots of other groups of people who will fix broken legs, as I described. They don't get to tell people about their ideas because the hospitals keep advising people. What we should actually have is independent counselling where people don't automatically go through the NHS.

As I say, it's not a great analogy because broken legs are 'wrong' while a pregnancy isn't, if you get me. Feel free to criticise it, as I imagine it could use some tweaking.

Dorries is being misleading and has been criticised for it massively, because she has constantly held on to the deceit that Marie Stopes etc are 'in the business' of providing abortions, comparing them to organisations who are in it for the money.

The trouble with Dorries' proposal is that the 'industry' is already regulated. There isn't a problem to address! The groups that provide counselling and/or abortion are well regulated, are **not** profit driven (charities etc) and are not trying to maximise the number of abortions. The very fact that they offer counselling, that ~20% of women carry on to have a child after getting advice and that they advise on family planning and contraceptives directly contradicts such claims.

Dorries also has a record of working with [far right Christian groups on opposing or altering abortion laws](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOSI5BVySK4&amp;feature=player_detailpage#t=332s). Her insistence that this is not really about giving faith based groups the option of counselling women is laughable. If that really were the case then her amendment would have made it clear that these independent groups *must* give unbiased information to women, [which is something BPAS etc **already do** as they are heavily regulated](http://www.bpas.org/bpasknowledge.php?npage=0&amp;news=431&amp;page=81&amp;year=2011). Link includes profit info:

&gt; bpas’ abortion treatments, comprehensive counselling services, male and female contraceptive and sterilisation services and sexually transmitted infection testing and treatment are all not-for-profit.

There is no problem here. The only issue is that faith groups, that ultimately want to decrease the number of abortions to roughly zero and control women's reproductive rights, don't have a say - which is why Nadine Dorries is working to change law little by little. Dorries is fooling no-one with her tactics of trimming the edges of abortion legislation - Reducing the time limit here, cutting who can advise women there... She and her ilk have learnt well from US Christian groups. This is demonstrated by the main campaign being called ""Right to Know"". It is carefully named as such to imply that something is being kept from women who are seeking abortion. Dorries claims not to know who funds that group, btw.

The call was for a block on counselling from groups who give abortions with the possibility of it being passed on to groups who are biased against abortion. That's the sinister underlying issue here, and I for one am pretty darn happy it was blocked so firmly.

My main problem with this theory is that the doctor considers gangers to be real people, as evidenced in The Rebel Flash.

Two, is the issue with the running bit he said. In the episode Army of Ghosts (or Doomsday, I don't remember which) the doctor says hes been running ever since he was a kid from the Untempered Schism and that he never stopped. So really to him that's virtually his entire life. Not everything he says can be taken literally every time.

Last, is the professor bit. We know that the River Song from LKH goes to the Lunar Academy to become an archaeologist and is not yet in prison. However that doesn't mean that she doesn't become a professor after she gets out of prison. We knows she does eventually because in Silence in the Library shes on the expedition by choice, and is a professor. Which leaves a gap after leaving prison.

So do I, my family seem to have bred in the NHS at various levels.

I wouldn't expect many doctors, nurses or administrators to support any kind of reform that would introduce choice and competition into the NHS it means more accountability for the work they do and generally a higher standard.

Monopolies on consumer choice is bad - we already [know that](http://www.freeeconhelp.com/2011/06/why-monopolies-are-bad-for-consumers_28.html). In a monopoly, we get poor quality and bad value for money. We also get stagnation. Why do we it want that in healthcare, of all things?

Regulated competition produces better quality, lower costs and innovation. Monopolies don't because they don't need to fight for their custom and can never fail - they operate in what is essentially a bottomless budget, and people rarely (compared to the private industry) lose their jobs because of poor performance.

I am not a freemarket nutcase - it is by no means the answer to everything. I know we need a state postal service, for example. I also know that we need the state to cover the cost of universal healthcare. I know the government needs to be heavily involved in the oversight of our healthcare.

Why not? They do in Germany. For emergency care it is complex, but ultimately providers bid for contracts. Emergency care in Germany is excellent. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_medical_services_in_Germany

I am interested in where your 25%/75% figure comes from. It can't be that high, surely? What about all the operations, drugs, treatments and therapies for long term and terminal illnesses? 

You say that there will be competition for the ""easy stuff"" and not for anything else. Again, why would this be the case? Why wouldn't there be competition for something because it is 'expensive'?  Again, I point to Germany, France, Denmark or Switzerland. If it is needed and there is a market for it, there will be competition to provide it.

true,Ivashkin,null,null,"I have a problem with this article as a source of news regarding Ken Clarke and a motion announcing that the UK is opting out of an EU directive guaranteeing access to a lawyer upon arrest.  So I looked into it and found that this is in regards to an [EU directive to ensure that suspects get a more uniform treatment from police across Europe](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-11618405), including having you rights read in a language you can understand. And a more technical explanation of the reason for the opt out is [here](http://www.europeanfoundation.org/my_weblog/2011/08/margarida-vasconcelos-the-draft-directive-on-the-right-of-access-to-a-lawyer-in-criminal-proceedings-requires-changes-in-the.html).

The key points seem to be:

&gt; The Secretary of State at the Minister of Justice, Kenneth Clarke, has explained to the European Scrutiny Committee that the UK already complied with several provisions of the draft directive, nevertheless the draft proposal will, unless amended during the negotiations, require changes in the UK law and practice. The proposal if adopted would increase the scope of existing UK law and practice in this area, consequently it would have financial implications, chiefly for the UK’s legal aid budget

and

&gt; Member States would be required to grant access to a lawyer upon deprivation of liberty and upon any questioning. In the UK access to a lawyer is granted before police interview, however any questioning, as required in the draft proposal, may entail questions made by the police outside a formal police interview. The access to a lawyer must also be granted at procedural or evidence-gathering acts, unless this would jeopardise the acquisition of evidence. However, the presence of a lawyer is not always required, in the UK, at all procedural or evidence gathering acts. The Government is hoping to change the wording of this provision during the negotiations. Moreover, the Government is concerned with the concept of ""access to a lawyer"" which does not include the legal advice provided by phone at police stations in England and Wales.

and

&gt; The draft proposal requires that all communications between a suspect and accused person and his/her lawyer must be entirely confidential, and there is no scope for derogations. However, the UK law provides for limited exceptions to confidentiality, for instance “where there is reason to believe that correspondence is being abused with intent to further a criminal purpose, prison authorities would have the ability to intercept correspondence.” The Government will seek, during the negotiations, that the proposal would allow limited exemptions to the principle of confidentiality.

So it is not a case that the government want to take away your right to see a lawyer as the Guardian is claiming in a discretely placed statement with nothing to back it up, but that attempts to harmonize the UK common law system with the continental civil law systems are having a few issues during negotiations. Which isn't really the same thing at all.

true,Little_Sally_Digby,tardis,TARDIS,"Until a fairly recent storyline, Batman had never made a public appearance or even been caught on film- there were people who could claim he was an urban legend made up by Gotham cops to be more intimidating. Similarly, until Grant Morrison- a British writer- got his hands on them in the nineties, the Xavier Institute for Gifted Children was never publicly connected with mutants; Charles Xavier was widely known to be a philanthropist and the two were considered separate charitable causes, which brings me to my next point: the X-Men themselves have always been public figures, but in a negative light. Mutants are hated and feared by ordinary people, which gives them a great incentive to either do good quietly- like the Doctor- and avoid taking credit at all costs because those they helped would only be harmed by having associated with them, or to speak out and accept that they won't be popular- they may even be in danger. 

Morrison's run on DC's flagship title, JLA, began with the arrival of an alien superteam who offered proactive attitudes toward Earth's problems- they covered the Sahara with fertile soil and altered its weather patterns through superhuman technology and personally executed several metahuman criminals. The Justice League defeated the Hyperclan because they were impostors planning on controlling the minds of humanity and making Earth their new homeworld, but at the end of the story they were forced to consider those truly world-changing possibilities, and decided that they weren't there to change the world. Superman said ""Humankind has to be allowed to rise to their own destinies. We can't carry them there."" (When questioned what the JLA's purpose was instead, he replied ""To catch them if they fall."")

Reed Richards is a scientist. He might change the world, but not in any way connected with his superheroic activities- more likely by creating FTL transmission technology, self-assembling homeless shelters, or a cancer treatment. Every day Annihilus doesn't come rampaging out of the Negative Zone, and Prince Namor doesn't crash through the wall of an oil company CEO, and the Inhumans don't descend from the Blue Area of the Moon to reclaim their homelands on Earth, and Galactus doesn't decide that blue planet looks mighty tasty, that's a day Reed Richards was dedicating his time to **not** changing the world.

What does ""saving normal everyday people"" mean? The Doctor doesn't only help the common man- he helps the President of the United States and a lost little girl, just in one recent episode, and he's saved the entire population of Earth several times, as well as people who look like fish, people who look like cacti, and people who look like that asshole stockbroker from Voyage of the Damned.

true,fxexular,null,null,"&gt;But I am convinced that if we allow freemarket aspects within the NHS (private providers competing for our 'custom'), we'll see better facilities, better value for money and a better standard of healthcare.

Outsourcing cleaning services to private companies led to dirty hospitals and MRSA. PFI tenders for new hospital buildings are often tens of times more expensive than publicly-funded buildings. 

Just look at dentistry for a useful analogue of what happens when private enterprise is given the go-ahead to flourish in the health sector. Gum disease--an easily acquired, difficult to treat condition that takes a long time to treat with very little profit in it. Fifty- to ninety-per-cent of people are said to have it simply because dentists just don't bother treating it. It is incredibly naïve to think that things would happen differently if we applied these methods to the entire health service. 

And just what about the cost of such a manoeuvre? There has never been a public service in this country that has been made cheaper by privatising it. The railways, for instance, gobble up far more public money now than they ever did as a national service--and that's with fewer trains, fewer employees, fewer services, weaker unions, more expensive fares. Not one tangible benefit has come from it. In light of disasters such as these, I think it would be criminally reckless to try and do likewise with an industry far more complex and expensive than the railways.",0,1315443364,null,0,false,0,c2i8ejl,t3_k80fk,t1_c2i8ejl,t1_c2i7uu7,1427571702,5,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,5

If our opposition has to put more than one on him because of his byline threat then it obviously opens up more space elsewhere for our other players.

This will hopefully work 2 ways, with Adebayor in the middle, hopefully Bale's crosses will be a lot more of a threat and if we can keep Huddlestone/Parker/Modric fit then they can take advantage of that midfield space. Not like Palacios who, let's be frank, was a one-trick pony and could either work really well defensively or get it in an attacking position and shoot it over the bar.

The other Doctor wakes up in the TARDIS later on, mourns his brother self, and eventually proceeds off into the universe, thus explaining why the TARDIS he came in didn't just sit in Nevada forever. (Alternatively, the Ganger Doctor explains his reasons and volunteers to go in place of the other... but then the other Doctor refuses to let him, because he's the Doctor, at which point the Ganger Doctor conks him out and *goes anyway*.)

true,Axius,uk,United Kingdom,"I agree. Profit has always been a primary motive second to quality.

The whole concept of supply and demand from a private sector perspective has been to match supply with demand at a level providing the least supply at the most profit. In terms of healthcare, this isn't a sensible model, we are simply hoping that the profit motive will cause competition to drive costs down and increase the quality of healthcare. There is no evidence that this will work.

People using the NHS are not aware of what their complaints are enabling. The moaning about waiting times for conditions that aren't life threatening is allowing space for politicians against the NHS to try legitimise legislation which would appear to be listening to their concerns but in reality really isn't. 

The principles of the NHS is for all British Citizens to be entitled to free healthcare, free at the point of use and with universal access - what isn't being considered at all here by the majority of people is how easily you can twist the 'free at the point of use' line. It does not mean 'free any time you want it' - it can literally be twisted to mean '""free"" when you have to use it' but there is no inclusion of free universal provision in anything I've read.

The original Tory system proposed at the time of the original NHS was a derivative of the US insurance system, whereby the proposition was that you would get insurance stamps that you would collect over time and they would entitle you to 'free' healthcare if you had enough. That still could be considered to be free at the point of use, but keeps costs down. I think the Conservatives ever since 1948 have had serious concerns about giving out free healthcare in terms of costs, and they are today facing an apathetic population that seems predominately concerned with their personal wellbeing rather than the bigger picture.

In LKH we see the first instance of River Song (Alex Kingston) before that she was Mels and before that she was Melody.  My suggestion is that maybe in River Song's perception LKH was the first time she attempted to kill the Doctor and that later on (after getting her degree in archaeology) gets in the Astronaut suit and waits in the lake to kill the Doctor - whether because of the brainwashing or the Silence directly telling her to.  An Astronaut suit is built for an adult, so even though it was modified for young Melody to wear it's possible that River Song (Alex Kingston) could wear it as well.  By older I simply meant later in her life as River Song not in another body/regeneration

Technically the Doctor has at least one more regeneration.

At the end, she dies but the spell has been reversed and everyone remembers her again. The Doctor holds her as she dies and says, ""I wouldn't have made that trade, &lt;name&gt;. It wasn't worth it.

Because it works.  The ones with money are in a much better position to pay for it.  And if they object, nobody's telling them they can't take a minimum wage job and enjoy the low tax lifestyle of the poor.

Because when you cover basic expenditure, the tax rate is actually lower.  Once you cover food, rent, and travel costs, a lot of people are on 100% effective tax rate.  i.e. they have zero surplus income after taxes.

As the top 10% of the highest earners shoulder the bulk of taxes (as shown in this thread)  the really big gainers from a flat tax would be the better off, whereas the poor would see no change in their income.

The average take from taxpayers' total income is 18.2%, but about 90% of taxpayers pay less than this. Tax rates have to be set higher than this because of the system of allowances which makes slices of income tax-free or eligible for tax at a lower rate. To collect the same revenue as is collected now with a flat tax - that is, just having one income tax band - would mean an average rate of 23%. 
This could be reduced if the Treasury decided to do away with all reliefs and allowances with the exception of the personal allowance - but even at 20% it would still leave 22 million people worse off.(quoted from http://www.guardian.co.uk/money/2005/oct/10/tax.politics)

A profit motivated company strives for efficiency and ultimately excellence (if patients have a choice). 

I'm of the belief that it is simply impossible to run an organisation the size of the NHS from a single provider efficiently. It is impossible. There is little performance or job justification accountability, people rarely lose their jobs, the budget is bottomless. 

In the successful insurance based European systems (ie where everyone has insurance fully paid for by the government to use at any hospital they wish), the profit motive drives efficiency, but is tempered by the quality motive driven by patient choice. All of this is then wrapped up in a regulated/licensed system. When the balance is right, companies can make profits while delivering excellent healthcare while investing on innovation while keeping things efficient.

It can be done.

You trust your dishwasher, your computer and a baby's life support machine. You trust the fact that your consumer choice has kept costs down, yet they still compete on quality and feature innovation. All of them were profit motivated, and I doubt they are of poor quality (and if one is, you know what the better quality option is).

true,turnforever,null,null,"I [blogged about this](http://nocolourandnosound.wordpress.com/2011/09/08/lifting-the-blood-ban/). Essentially, my problem is that the criteria conflate a sexual preference (men who have sex with men) with a lifestyle. If men who sleep with men are more likely to have HIV 30 years after AIDS was first referred to as 'gay-related immune deficiency', then there is a problem with the way children (and adults) are being taught about homosexuality and sexual health, and there is social, educational and medical work to be done. The solution isn't a panic-ban. There's plenty of space for more nuanced questioning.

And, to the poster who commented about trust - it's no more unreasonable to say 'I trust my partner and so should you' than it is to say 'I've only ever had sex with women. Trust me'.

It's not helpful to say that this 'isn't about equality'. By its very nature equality isn't something that only applies in certain circumstances. It's that kneejerk 'but gays ARE more infectious right?' attitude that leads to this kind of regressive policy. It is not ok to tar millions of people with the same brush.

And can the blood service really speak on behalf of everyone who might ever need a blood transfusion? There's a small risk of contracting HIV from such a procedure. All medical procedures are risky. Why is this one treated so differently? Get patients to sign a waiver.

I don't think the NHS has so many systemic faults as you seem to believe. As the parts which may rely on some form of competition - innovation, etc. are done outside of the NHS.

No doubt the drive of the profit motive produces products as well, but the question is whether it's truly required and how the benefits weigh up against the downsides. The mantra of the profit system is: ""Your necessity is my opportunity""

And in healthcare this can be particularly damaging if not well controlled.

But to address the other issue, I think the profit system is fundamentally broken. As the profit means that the workers are not being paid the full value of the goods and services they produce. For example, workers making shoes might be paid $1 for each pair they produce whilst they are sold for $10, this then means the workers must produce 10 pairs of shoes for each pair they can afford to buy. Across the whole economy, this leads to apparent overproduction, as the masses cannot afford to purchase all the goods being produced at profitable prices, and so the economy slows down as the goods are not sold and production is scaled back with redundancies to try and keep businesses afloat, which worsens the purchasing power of the masses. And so it creates repeated recessions as we overproduce, create an economic crisis, then steadily consume and recover, only for the overproduction to continue again.

This is completely unrelated to the discussed issue, but I thought I'd mention it, since there are legitimate reasons that people oppose the system.",0,1315481123,null,0,false,0,c2ibtlo,t3_k80fk,t1_c2ibtlo,t1_c2ibpcr,1427573321,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

[Citation Needed] 

No seriously, this is a really complex problem to analyse and to objectively measure the 'benefit' of the system thoroughly enough we need loads of reliable data. We aren't going to get anywhere if we just throw newspaper headlines at each other.

What about [this report (PDF) from 2010](http://www.commonwealthfund.org/~/media/Files/Publications/Fund%20Report/2010/Jun/1400_Davis_Mirror_Mirror_on_the_wall_2010.pdf) carried out by a US group, which compares the healthcare systems of 7 different countries across a variety of indicators. The NHS ranks 1^st for efficiency and comes in 2^nd place overall. 

Obviously this is just one study and you really need several to start to build up a good picture but from what I've heard, in general, the NHS as it *currently* stands is one of the best and most efficient systems in the world and there really aren't massive changes that could be made without changing that. We're really just down to refining what we have and building on it as necessary.

Politicians and the media love to go on about the NHS because it effects everyone and it's very easy to use statistics in such a way that you can nearly always make your particular argument appear valid, at least as far as is necessary to fool the public (which isn't too hard lets be honest). The NHS is like a political cricket ball that's always in play and everybody has to have a go in order to keep up appearances but, nobody really seems interested in the intricacies of the game.

It might be that after very careful consideration of all the data the stereotypical conservative philosophy of 'privatising everything makes it better' just so happens to be exactly what the NHS needs in order to make it 'better'. Somehow though I don't trust Cameron this much. Either way what the NHS needs is evidence based decision making and any changes should be based on such rather than political idiology.

true,back-in-black,english,England,"&gt; If thats the case, why vote at all?

Because it is arguably better than the alternatives. Direct democracy can lead to mob rule. Socrates was effectively executed by an unfair legal decision made by a democratic mob. Winston Churchill said ""The best argument against democracy is a conversation with the average voter"". He was being flippant, but there is some truth to that.

You only have to look at the petitions on the Number 10 website to get an idea of the kind of stuff direct democracy would bring; the death penalty, withdrawal from the EU, kangaroo courts, free shit for everyone paid with endless borrowing.

If you have a Representative Democracy and each party that comes to power comes to the same decision on a given topic, then there is a good bet that there is some merit to that decision. 

&gt; If all we need is someone who knows whats best for us why not simply appoint people on merit and ignore ballots entirely?

Well, this effectively says: if we don't have direct Democracy, then why don't we just have a Monarchy or a Dictatorship? Because deciding merit is what Monarchs and Dictators do. They are a single decision making point for deciding on ""merit"", who has it, and who doesn't. ""Merit"" can be money, or social class, or actual ability. Great if you pick a good ""merit picker"" and very bad if you pick a bad one. Then you also have the question of ""who decides on the merit of the next merit picker in line to decide on other peoples merit""? 

If you're really interested in this stuff, and you're not just trying to pick a fight, then I recommend ""The Republic"" by Plato (although I dislike his conclusions) and any book that takes you historically from the Roman Republic, through to its effective conversion to a hereditary monarchy, and its eventual decline and collapse. ""Rubicon: The last years of the Roman Republic"", ""The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire"" and, more casually, ""I, Claudius"", are good books.

&gt; Just because there was a petition doesn't mean it's what everybody else wants or that it will become law.

That's right. And the reason for that is that we have a representative democracy, not a direct one. 

&gt; Also if voters are making poor decisions thats probably more to do with poor information and education. Both problems that should be fixed rather than claiming ""people are too dumb to know what is good for them"".

Well, you put words in my mouth there. 

People are specialised. Most spend 40 hours a week or more working, on top of commuting, cooking, cleaning, entertainment, etc. As a society, we do not have the time or inclination to absorb all the information required to make an informed decision on a complex subject. That is why we elect representatives who we think represent our world view, and those representatives are advised by specialists employed by the civil service.

Great! That can't be said of everyone here. A lot of people get really angry simply because they disagree. 

&gt; I've read quite light stuff of on Roman Republic ""I, Claudius"" and the Robert Harris books dramatising the life of Cicero. Its interesting in its own right, and also interesting the period were so many modern republican ideals came from.

Great! Then in ""I,Claudius"" you saw what Robert Graves was describing, a long slow decline from a responsible, benevolent dictator ""Augustus"", toward men like Caligula and Nero. Great as Augustus was, the changes he and his ""father"" made, made Caligula and Nero possible. 

In ""The Republic"" Aristotle concludes we'd all be best governed by a class of philosophers. But, of course, he would say that. He was a philosopher. I suppose, given the power of the civil service, you could argue that that is exactly what we have.

&gt; The key question being of course, is to whom that decision has merit.

Yes. Slip of the keyboard there. You would imagine that, on average, they do what they think is best for the country as a whole. But this is up for debate too.

Well, I was being flippant. But more seriously, you must consider how much government spending is paid for with taxes, and how much is paid for by increasing the overall national debt, and simply paying off the interest. 

&gt; So would = maybe, now?

Huh?

&gt;&gt; Winston Churchill said ""The best argument against democracy is a conversation with the average voter"". He was being flippant, but there is some truth to that.

&gt; I'm not putting the words in your mouth. 

&gt;I never said we elect people to make decisions for us because we are all dumb. I said that you did.

Well, in that case, you were either misquoting me, or you were misquoting Winston Churchill. Neither myself, nor that Churchill quote claimed that people were dumb. 

&gt; People feel that no matter who they vote for they will have a result that does not benefit them. This is why voter apathy is so high, direct democracy could lead to mob rule if left unchecked. No one is advocating for that, though, a mixture of approaches could work well and re-engage voters who feel their voice is lost.

Well, then feel free to start a political party that proposes this direct democracy reform, then. Of course, you may find it difficult to get only the stuff you *want* passed by popular vote.

Yes, it's very popular, because it's cheap, because it's subsidised.  It's also not really even a restaurant business, it's a real estate business.  But my point was that you claimed the best won in capitalism, clearly it's not the case, the very cheap, well-marketed and just about bearable wins.

true,DogBotherer,null,null,"Well, often, sure.  I'm not denying the point you're making at all, most of the deaths are drink/drug related.  But it's still the case that many of these deaths would not have occurred had the individuals concerned _not_ been in police custody.  FYI, here are the main findings of the study:

* The most frequent characteristics of those who died were that they were white (75%), men (90%) aged between 25 and 44 (48%). On average they were 39 years-old.
* The ethnic breakdown was as follows - 76% white, 7% black and 5% Asian - representative of the general ethic make up of the custody population.
* Approximately three-quarters of those who died had a link to drugs and/or alcohol, in that they were intoxicated, had been arrested for alcohol and/or drug related offences, or the cause of death was related to alcohol and/or drugs.
* On average there were 2.2 deaths per 100,000 notifiable arrests, a figure that ranged from 3.6 in 1998/99 to 1.0 in 2008/09
* In the first year of the study there were 15 suicides , but this fell to 3 a year in the rest of the period the study looked at. This appears to correlate with the beginning of work to make custody suites safer. Previous Home Office research found that between 1990 and 1996 172 deaths in custody (63%) had been caused by 'deceased own actions', including 73 hangings.
* 58 people had mental health issues, including 17 who were detained under section 136 of the Mental Health Act.
* Of the 87 cases where restraint was used on a detainee, it was linked to the death on 16 occasions.
* Less than half of detainees that were booked into custody and should have been risk assessed were actually risk assessed.
* In 87 cases misconduct action was recommended for police officers/staff and 13 officers were charged with criminal offences.
* Over the period of the study no officers have been convicted of any offence in relation to the death of detainee. One police member of staff received a six-month sentence of imprisonment for misconduct in public office.",0,1315500572,null,0,false,0,c2idsoz,t3_k8nse,t1_c2idsoz,t1_c2idpm9,1427574244,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

No.

&gt; I hadn't realized this mid week game until now. How do you guys think it will effect the selection for the sunderland game and the manchester united game? Do we rest some players against leverkusen? Who?

(I hadn't realized the new matches were added either) I think we'll see everyone getting a fair amount of minutes over the entirety of September. I'd peg Lukaku and McEachran to start against Fulham in the Carling Cup, Mata to start against Leverkusen and possibly United, Sturridge to start maybe for Leverkusen too. I can see a lot of the old guard starting for the United game.

Bayer Leverkusen line up in a 4-4-2, or 4-4-1-1 as best as I can tell.   
Bernd Leno; Ömer Toprak, Stefan Reinartz, Michal Kadlec, Gonzalo Castro; Simon Rolfes (Michael Ballack), Lars Bender; Andre Schuerrle, Sidney Sam; Stefan Kiessling, Renato Augusto.

It's a 4-4-2 with two very good wide players in Sam and Schuerrle, two up and coming young German wingers. Rolfes and Ballack split time in the midfield, never play together so Bender usually has a guaranteed spot. I'd reckon Ballack will start for the Chelsea match. Kiessling has generally been an inconsistent striker and had a quiet year last season. Renato Augusto, although listed as a forward, is Bayer's #10 and he's more of an attacking midfielder, hence I think they play a 4-4-1-1, with Augusto tucking in behind Kiessling and setting up the wingers and striker. It's almost a 4-2-3-1 really, with two central midfielders, two wingers, the playmaker and centre forward, very similar to Germany's national team setup.",0,1315506588,null,0,false,0,c2iep5x,t3_k8zej,t1_c2iep5x,t3_k8zej,1427574666,3,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,3

Nope. Plenty of other ISPs have their own backbone (in that they have a network that connects all of their ADSL equipment to the internet), hell, Sky used to own an entire global IP transit network too as part of Easynet.

In a way Be has to rent from BT too - it's BT's lines they need to connect to, and they do it all with their own equipment housed in a BT building. Other ISPs opt to use BT's ADSL equipment instead (but you still use your ISP's core network/internet transit), as it provides nationwide coverage quickly and at less cost. Especially now that BT have rolled out fibre to the cabinet/home. That doesn't necessarily make them more inferior (although you probably won't find a unlimited tariff).

Virgin are therefore the company least reliant on BT - they have their own access network (the cable network), and a backbone to support that. They're still a bit shit though.

It isn't static (as in Virgin haven't guaranteed not to change it, neither will they warn you beforehand if they are going to).
