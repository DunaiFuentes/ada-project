Sending kids to private school = freeing up space in a state school, thus reducing class sizes.    

&gt;take all the tax that they would have paid until they were 85

If someone is educated in a country, then leaves for somewhere else, they become a net contributor to the new country and a drain on the old one. Thousands of middle class folks are leaving the UK every year, taking skills and tax with them. The question should be, why is the UK so bad that these people are willing to leave?    

     
My point is that for those who choose to stay, who are rich, they should be taxed. Why is there no wealth tax in the UK for instance?

I don't have time to write a polemic but Dickens, Orwell (I'm talking about road to wigan pier and down and out in paris and london btw) and pretty much the rest of the literary cannon already covered most of it anyway... 
  
Wage Slavery is where people are forced into slave like work and obedience by necessity - and yes of course to some degree this is true of all of us, we're all fighting a war against the Taliban, does that mean i get delta team six's medals?  The brutality and cruelty come from this, they come from the fact that people have no choices and can be manipulated into accepting ever more unfair conditions, ever harsher workloads and ever more draconian legislations.  
  
You ask who isn't a wage slave?  Well at the moment not many people, that's a large part of the problem - it's systemic.  Someone who has self-autonomy, options, dignity - they're pretty much the key traits you'd be looking for but it gets more complex of course because simple concepts like dignity have been modified to fit modern lexicons thus rendering them two faced and dangerous to wield.  Working for other people is a great thing to do as is working for yourself, i'm not against either of those things and i'm rather disappointed you'd be so disingenuous as to try and hang me so.  The problem comes when people are taken advantage of because they have no other options, when people are treated like slaves because they can't say no.  
  
I'm honestly not sure if you're just trying to be clever or if these concepts are entirely new to you, do you really need to be go over the basic criticisms of an unchecked capitalist system?  or have you simply never seen much of how the world works to be able to apply it to real situations, do i maybe need to find some newspaper clippings or bbc4 documentaries for you?",0,1313488378,null,0,false,0,c2ctk6h,t3_jilli,t1_c2ctk6h,t1_c2ctdpx,1428216538,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

Mainly we've got to have a serious debate on how to approach it. We should definitely break up the Met into various borough police forces in an effort to help hamper militarisation of the Met with armed officers falling under direct responsibility of Scotland Yard and Serious Crimes office.

Using former criminals for advice sessions with young people to help turn them away from crime, less custodial sentencing and more community service.

Education wise, we should see about helping 'non-academic' students find their calling, technical schools and such can be helpful with this along with apprenticeships. - Maybe using tax incentives to encourage businesses to employ within the UK or a set number of paid intern positions.

On drugs - Legalisation of soft drugs from licensed retailers in licensed locations, using the money for rehab centres. Decriminalisation of hard drug possession (unless there's enough for distribution rather than consumption) but rehab schemes will be recommended/compulsory for users.

true,Axius,uk,United Kingdom,"One of the major problems society faces, or at least the youths, is the 'you must be this qualified to do this' situation. We've become a society that loves to assess itself to be able to clearly say 'Yes, they can do this'. 

If you fall off the grid for this, the product of this is that you can't do much to get back on it. If you fail your GCSEs, there's no information as to what you could do to resit them later or pursue an alternative. If you fail your A Levels, there's no information as to what alternatives exist, you are only told you can't go to University. We need much better information available for everyone and opportunities intended for the people who wants them should be clearly indicated. Courses at colleges should be willing to accept people who show they clearly want to do them, for example.

What we have at present is a very ineffective Jobcentre service that could do with a massive overhaul to stop being a factory for benefits and instead genuinely be targeted at providing a useful service. Half of the schemes run when people move into the New Deal period of JSA are useless.

Another problem we're facing with regards to things like unemployment is the whole appearance thing at interviews too. Poorer people cannot afford to splash out on suits or dress clothing for an interview, which themselves have become a game of jumping through hoops. You need two references minimum, sometimes more, then the interviewers try to trip you up with a variety of questions - single mothers and the stereotypical poor parents on estates will most likely not have the references, not have the ability to afford the clothing for the interviews and may not understand or have the experience to answer half the questions asked in an interview. These selection process barriers really do hurt people who may initially genuinely want to work but are pushed to the fringe by society for being unable to meet the demands these processes impose.

Another issue is how the unemployed partner in a relationship is unable to apply for JSA. Women who perhaps opted to be a stay-at-home mother are unable to apply for JSA to receive some form of income whilst looking for a job after their children have grown up. I feel JSA claims should be per individual circumstance, not per household.

These are just a few concerns I have. What needs to be done is not clear cut, because each strata of society has different concerns. If you ask poor families in various suburbs of the United Kingdom what they think should be done, you will get different answers to asking average-income families, as you would do from asking richer families.

Advertising, TV, the media and social norms perhaps are responsible for creating this sense that Britain has somehow been broken recently. Society never has and never will be like it is in the films and the books, but we are exposed to this concept of a 'normal' society so much that we can't help but feel that society is broken and we look for reasons why. We blame the scroungers, the drug and drink addicts, the vandals, the immigrants... the reality is that society has always had problems with inequalities. It's perhaps just more emphasised in modern media that these poorer people exist as they are portrayed like some kind of a freak show in direct opposition to the daily life we lead so we have 'a story' for the newspapers and news. 

The problems of society have to be dealt with from a better perspective than looking down on a whole subclass of people. They are still people, and as soon as you relegate them to beneath you through coming up with ideas that are meant to 'bring them up to your level', I feel you run the risk of disillusioning those who might benefit.

Don't misunderstand, personal responsibility should still factor in to things. It just isn't quite as simple as saying 'They need to be more responsible for themselves' and waving a magic wand and expecting it to happen.

The biggest problem we have is that the union is a completely separate business (but still very much profit driven) to the uni but they are both pretty incestuous with each other. They both just invested so much money in redevelopment the costs now really hit the students. As a representative body for the students they are great but as soon as a campaign might hurt their bottom line they can be really bad. 

For example there is a student magazine which is a decent read and they sell advertising in. A group of students wanted to start a newspaper that would have been separate from the union giving them no editorial say so. In other words the newspaper was going to be critical of them. Now this was one of those projects that has steam for a couple of months and then dies out of losing energy. But they inflamed that situation by trashing them on FB and making formal complaints with the university. All because they felt it would hurt their bottom line, even if they were trashing people directly and we did not hear about it we all know don't feed the trolls.

As Ron Paul famously said in the US recently.  How many of you would go and try heroin if it were legal tomorrow?  Not many I would guess.

Even if you did want to try it; it's not like you couldn't go out and get some now.  It's everywhere and it doesn't take much effort to get in touch with the kinds of people who will sell it to you.

Taking it out of the hands of dealers also deals with the multitude of issues that drugs do cause.  A majority of issues people associate with drugs are caused by its illegal nature.

If it's legal and served through a pharmacy then purity isn't an issue any more.  This removes on of the main reasons for overdoses.  Picking up clean needles while you pick up your drugs also means less issues with from spreading disease.  Pharmacies will also ask for ID - and whilst we won't be able to keep it fully out of the hands of children - dealers don't ask for ID at all so it's a big improvement.

Then there's the black market.  If it's no longer profitable to sell drugs then a huge source of black market revenue vanishes overnight.  Increase sentencing for anyone still trying to sell just to be safe.  Throw new laws on purity into the equation as to doubly-screw the dealers selling drugs cut with other substances.

A majority of health issues associated with drug use are also down to what they're cut with.  I'm not saying their safe, but Prof Nutt wasn't wrong when he said that riding a horse is more dangerous than extasy.

true,uB166ERu,null,null,"&gt;My own thoughts are that the media has to take some responsibility, crap like Big Brother and X-Factor and Britains Got Talent reinforce the idea that you don't need to work hard to get shiny toys.

&gt;Obviously, that's not the only cause. Kids in deprived areas see the local dealers all blinged up and figure that selling a bit of blow is a damn sight easier than studying or working for a living, and that leads directly or indirectly to gang culture.

You sound like someone who has been born and raised in a ""decent"" family and given all the opportunities to make something of your life. 

I think the fact that a lot of people in Britain are so unaware how privileged they are in comparison to a lot of the people at the bottom of society is one of the main reasons that led people to looting and rioting!! 

I am sorry but I am very much disgusted that you imply that they much rather loot or sell drugs than go studying or working. 

Inside your little priviliged world you live in, you probably have had chances to go to a good school and maybe have had a chance to study at a descent university. You probably never had to worry about being stuck in a financial situation you couldn't get out of. You probably have found a job to be able to make a living. 

THERE ARE MANY PEOPLE WHO AREN'T ABLE TO STUDY, OR GET A JOB... 

Ignoring that is the worst you can do in dealing with these problems. 

It doesn't apply completely to Britain but I advice you to read this and realize how privileged you are:

true,ezekielziggy,eng-sussex,Sussex,"The Economist did a special on this 2 years ago. Statistically we're doing a fair bit better, social indicators; crime, teenage pregnancy ect all seem to have declined in recent years. We're still doing really badly when compared to our European neighbours though, often scoring really low on social indicators. 

As for the response 
1. Education education education. 

2. People need a stake in the society they live in, whether it's doing volunteer work or through sports/arts. This needs to be emphasised from an early age, my school really put an emphasis on reaching out to the community and I think the kids were better as a result of it.

3. People need a sense of ownership of the services provided by the state. I'm not talking about dismantling the welfare system, I'm suggesting that people need to make a contribution to housing/schools ect if they are to have any stake in it, even if it is a token amount. 

4. Increase transparency and accountability where possible in the public and private sector.

5. For heavens sake we need to stop paying people who can't afford to raise a child to have babies. We need to give people a hand up not a hand out, raising people's dependence on the state does not help matters. It puts constraints on public housing and the public purse. Children born into this environment are also more likely to fall into the wrong crowd.

6. The British might love the underdog but they sure hate success and love to see someone fall from grace. Our tabloids feed on this desire and our legal system penalises those who take risks.

We need to integrate our communities more effectively. Having religious schools funded by the public purse certainly doesn't help matters. 
Also in Singapore public housing is spread all over the islands and they have racial quotas to ensure that people are integrated. Where ever you go you can find people of all income brackets and cultures.

Decent public transport. It is a bloody disgrace.

We need to pay our public figures salaries that are competitive to the private sectors. I would rather pay someone a bit more to ensure that they are competent, otherwise we end up making false economies.

Morrisons is my favourite - 99.999% of the time brilliant service - polite , not aggressive . Sainsburys is very good except at the checkouts . I will certainly shop at ASDA . I'm not a Waitrose fan - too snobby and hate the car park arrangement .

The big problem I have is the treatment of the vast population of the intelligent as stupid . This is primarily by the corporates via aggressive marketing - treating customers in an aggressive and rude manner in order to manipulate them into buying more product and services . It occurs with many supermarket chains , petrol station chains , and even down to car yards . And it often includes the ramming of loyalty cards down customers throats . They think that we will blindly accept what they say and do as we are commanded .

Personally I avoid companies like that like the plague . I place a high premium on good service . I think that it's a thing that we all need to protest - to reclaim our freedom from commercial domination and manipulation .

I had a classic incident at M&amp;S a year ago . I , like a lot of British and like the Continent in general , use reusable shopping bags . I was in their grocery section and had one bag filled up and was filling up the other when a management type came up to me and , in short , stated that I had to use their own hand baskets and that they did not allow their customers to use their own bags . I said 'no problems' and promptly started unloading the bags , initially piling up items into his arms , then on the side . He thought he could manage the situation - that M&amp;S was so good that the customer would stay and comply . After I had finished I walked off , turned around and waved 'bye bye' and you should have seen the look on his face when he realised just what he had done . Those previous two years his bosses have been trying very hard to maintain sales . They found out that their success was primarily due to loyalty . I am in their core group - my grandmother was a life long customer of M&amp;S , likewise my mother and myself . Now I am no longer an M&amp;S customer . So he went completely against his bosses . I went around the corner and straight into Sainsbury's and joined the other customers with their reusable shopping bags never to return to M&amp;S .

So you see these corporate types think that they can manipulate the customers when all they end up doing is making themselves look stupid .

Have we all lost our rights to complain about not being treated with some dignity until proven guilty (and even after)? I have complained plenty of times about shitty service I have received from various places. 

Being accused of shoplifting when you are a law-abiding citizen can be a very unpleasant experience. I briefly worked in a small shop to pay for my studies and a few months after I had left, I received some very unpleasant calls/e-mails from the shop owner accusing me of stealing three cartons of dildos (it was a gift shop selling all sorts of kinky stuff). The owner was an imbecile and I'm pretty sure he lost track of them because he was rubbish at stock-managing; needless to say I didn't do it but the people I used to work with probably still think I did (nevermind how I would have gotten three huge boxes out of the shop unnoticed or what I would have done with a hundred dildos). I will never see them again but the very thought that these people still think I'm guilty of this enrages me as I write this, 3 years later. 
Theft is, in our collective minds, a very degrading thing. And something we often associate with other criminal activities, drug use and being a low-life without any education. Just look at the coverage from last week on the lootings...

true,terahurts,eng-lincolnshire,"Cleethorpes, definitely not Grimsby","&gt;You clearly sound like someone who has been born and raised in a ""decent"" family and given all the opportunities to make something of your life.

Partly, I was raised in a middle-working class family with one working parent (a Postman, in case it matters).  My parent's sacrificed a lot to give me a decent upbringing, even if I didn't get the latest toys every Christmas.

&gt;Inside your little priviliged world you live in you probably have had chances to go to a good school and maybe have had a chance to study in a descent university. You probably never had to worry about being stuck in a financial situation you couldn't get out of. You probably have found a job to be able to make a living.

Mostly wrong.  I went to uni, paying for it by working pretty much every evening and weekend and bank holiday I could, and I spent ten years working in 2nd line IT support, making around £25k/yr.  Then my wife got sick and now I'm a carer for her, who is thanks to the latest round of DWP BS no longer disabled enough to be classed as disabled enough to receive DLA.  So, we live on (and have been for the past six years) on state benefits, since she's no longer able to work, and it's amazing how many people don't want to give you a job when you tell them you'll need to just pop home every couple of hours to make sure your wife hasn't wet the bed.  I have to ask my *son* to pay for my fucking internet access since it's pretty much the only outside contact with the world my wife has left.  Every week we get to make the fun decision between having gas or having electricity left for the weekend. Try telling *your* kids you can't afford Christmas this year, when they are bombarded with adverts for overpriced crap from November onwards. 
Oh and next week, I get to go to court and find out if I still have a roof over my head.

So. Don't make fucking assumptions about people you know nothing about.  A punch in the face often offends.

&gt;THERE ARE MANY PEOPLE WHO AREN'T ABLE TO STUDY, OR GET A JOB...

Yes there are, I live in one of the UK's most deprived areas (Grimsby), and I see the queues outside of the Jobcenter all the time.  I also see kids who should be at school drinking supermarket cider in the local parks at 10 in the morning.  I live amongst the poor, I'm *fucking one of them*.  Living on benefits is like living in purgatory, there is *nothing* to look forward to, no pride or respect, and when the whole community is like that its a disaster waiting to happen.  On the street I live in, 60% of the house are 'social housing' 35% are owned by landlords living in the south of France, and the other 5% by people lucky enough to be able to afford a mortgage, by virtue of having and actual job that pays decent money.

As for the '5 things...' link you so kindly posted.  Really? You think I and 99% of the rest of the country on benefits doesn't already know that shit 1st hand?  

&gt;What would help?
Give every body a decent education.
Create Jobs, by investing in production (like Germany), stop investing in investment companies and banks.

So how do we get the kids who don't want to have a decent education to study?  Most of those that are drinking in the parks don't see the point in going to school since there's no jobs for them to take.

I completely agree with the investment in production.  I started my working life as a mechanical engineer just as most of our production capacity was being sold offshore.  The local fishing docks are empty of trawlers, and have been since the 'Cod Wars'.  Quoting Tommah666 from above:

&gt;Education wise, we should see about helping 'non-academic' students find their calling, technical schools and such can be helpful with this along with apprenticeships. - Maybe using tax incentives to encourage businesses to employ within the UK or a set number of paid intern positions.

Sounds like a good idea to me.

I recommend the independant film theatre at the Corn Exchange in Ipswich for some good independant films, there is obviously the Cineworld which has all of the mainstream films on and includes 3D etc but I often find it nicer to go to the smaller theatre which is run by volunteers.
As far as drinking is concerned Isaacs on the quayside is great for a drink in the summer and it really can feel like you are on holiday down by the water. The Swan is a real good Pub but tends to have younger more trendy student types frequenting it (showing my age!). I really like the Dove and the Fat Cat though as they have a better variety of beers and a more adult crowd. Very relaxed and friendly places. 
For food there is a real variety, Aqua 8 is a great place for asian fusion and Mizu is not bad but not as good quality. Lots and lots of food places as we are inundated with pubs but worth asking around amongst your new colleagues etc. 
Ipswich is not the best town but I am not willing to slate it as lots seem to. It is as good as any.
I hope your stay here is a good one.

* Legislate a National Living Wage (~£7.50 depending on area)
* Build more housing, not just that, but build social housing mixed in with private housing to prevent ghettoisation. So many other issues stem from housing and where it's build, the biggest one being immigration.
* Split up the savings and investment aspects of banks, so people's ordinary savings and current accounts are protected from the failures of the investment side of banks. Heavily regulate the investment sector and mutualise the savings sector.
* Nationalise transport and utilities
* Create a National Care Service along the lines of the NHS, none of this outsourcing care to private companies bullcrap (we've seen what can happen with Southern Cross)
* Increase Corporation Tax. It should not be almost as low as the basic rate of income tax.
* Create more tax bands, including rates of ~60% for the superrich. There are many people who earn well over £150,000 (current level at which people start paying 50% tax rate) who can be taxed higher. Similarly, reinstate the 10% tax rate.
* Legalise Euthanasia (with strict rules of its use)
* Sex education to include more on homosexuality and transexuality from a young age. One instance of it being done in a London school showed pretty much all instances of homophobic bullying being eradicated.
* Abolish private and grammar schools and give much greater incentives for people to become teachers in the state sector (higher pay)
* Maku university education free or otherwise reduce tuition fees to a sub £3000 level
* Replace the monarchy with a directly-elected non-partisan President (like in Ireland)
* Greater investment in the sciences and other quaternary industries
* Provision of more apprenticeships and other forms of training for post 18 year olds.
* Encourage social enterprise and alternative business models such as co-operatives
* Increase the wage-bargaining powers of Trade Unions and encourage industrial democracy to create better paid employees who feel like they have a stake in their workplace and society
* Creation and increase funding of early-intervention centres like SureStart as well as youth centres, clubs and advisory services like Connexions
* Abolish the House of Lords altogether (or, more realistically, some kind of elected chamber which does not challenge supremacy of the Commons)
* Adoption of AV+ as the electoral system for the Commons
* Tax-breaks for companies which invest in green technology and energy
* Give Prisoners the vote, make sure the emphasis of the justice system is on rehabilitation not punishment in order to reduce reoffending rates. Reduce number of ineffectual short sentences.
* Reduce voting age to 16
* Have an evidence-based, full investigation into the legal status of currently banned recreational drugs
* Scrapping of Britain's independent nuclear deterrent, either not having one at all, or, if we must, have a joint one with France
* That said, build more nuclear power stations as part of the vital energy mix which includes more renewable like wind but also recognize that in the short term we still need some fossil fuel generation 
* Employ Doctor Who to go back in time and prevent Thatcher from becoming prime minister (I couldn't quite resist putting one funny one on here...)

Many ISP's allow you to check your usage online, and many routers have the ability to track total UL/DL totals by internal IP addresses.  If you have this capability, You can determine which internet connected device is using the lion's share of the data.

Lastly, make sure you have a SECURE wireless connection.  If you are secured via WEP, I'd recommend changing the encryption to WPA/WPA2 if possible.  Make sure the router's firmware is updated.

Yes, the corporation is supported by commercial subsidiaries such as BBC Worldwide, but the money for this is put back into the BBC to fund more programming.

If they can make money by selling their work worldwide without negatively impacting the local market, then they must by mandate do so.

I'll completely agree that Carlsberg Export (for example) is crap, but it's still a premium lager.

As for the ""lager tastes shit when it's warm"" point, that's always going to come down to personal preference. I'm not a big ale/bitter fan, I can appreciate the odd pint but for me nothing beats a really cold lager at the end of a long day. I do understand your point, and I appreciate there's a lot more variety and complexity in traditional beers, they just rarely hit the spot for me.

Actually, that said, I went to Seattle recently on my honeymoon as was drinking a lot of locally brewed IPAs and did really enjoy them. Not sure I'd want to drink them all the time but they were a nice change. I was actually surprised at how good their beers were. The lagers I tried were predictably poor though.

They thought she had stolen something, she had not. I imagine if they had actual evidence of the crime, they'd have only been too happy to parade it. As it happens, they did not.

They could have also used some common sense, if a customer has just paid for £250 worth of shopping, what are the chances she's stealing a bottle of shampoo?

I absolutely, completely agree with you about the underestimation of what it's like to be at the bottom of the pile.

Most poor people are by no means stupid, or lazy, just trapped in a situation that's incredibly hard to get out of.  As a an examples the local Matalan advertised for 50 new jobs recently, and had over 600 applicants.  That's by no means unusual in the area, but obviously employers are more likely to give positions to people with experience or failing that people with better qualifications, so those who struggle with the '3 R's' are also struggling to get any job at all.  Any business opening or expanding in the area is front page news in the local rag.  I'm guessing it's pretty much the same all over the country.

If it was up to me, I'd combine some of the ideas from others above; Pay MPs the same as someone living on benefits and make them live in 'social housing' whilst in London.

For something to be done we're either in a crisis or ""sleep walking"" into a crisis. This is how you end up with social deprivation, not because you don't beat children/poor money into shit schools or send kids to academies.

The riots didn't *just* happen over night; I lived in a council flat in hackney for a year and I can tell you that most of the people had nothing, literally. All this crap about benefits is hyperbole. The benefit fraudsters are shits but they make, maybe, £12k tax free a year; hardly the life of lavish luxury people make it out to be.

Gangs have been claiming children by offering them trainers and technology for years; Kids deal with muggings all the time; when members of the community tell the police about these things, if they turned up at all, they would see them as a kid from a council estate and bugger off. If middle class people are right to complain about policing being able to do nothing by law, these people have a right to complain about police doing nothing but stop and searching kids (rightly or wrongly). We have done nothing to instill our values in these communities so why do we act with indignation when they turn out not to have our work ethic, political views or measured aspirations?

In short, people are right to be angry at rioters and violent kids but the middle class have been so apathetic that its hard to feel sorry for those that have been calling them ""chav scum"" or ""rats"" for years.

Certain people seem to be loving these riots (those that aren't directly affected, that is) as it gives them an excuse to use all of their angry hate filled sentiments about working class people on a massively general scale, the kind of thing you'd expect from a Victorian.

The UK system spreads less money than the USA as a percentage of GDP, but does so amongst a larger percentage of the population, so you have less cash per person to spend.

The USA spends more money, but on a smaller percentage of the population - so it is obvious that the healthcare system will be better, for those who can afford it, but far worse for those who can't.

As your friend what would happen to the elderly person without medical insurance, savings or assets? Even the federal Medicare system only picks up 80% of the cost for elderly patients.

The question should be is it better to offer basic healthcare to everyone, or an outstanding healthcare to a few, and appalling healthcare to the rest?

I could take the argument further and point out that the Indian system delivers a private healthcare system to those who can afford it that offers about 90% of the value of the NHS for about half the cost.

They might be making huge profit but they are still a business, and as a business they need to protect themselves. The technology, on the whole, works. The vast, vast majority of the time those things go off, it is because there is something on the person that should be setting them off. If they have paid for it, then the security tag will be removed and it's actually beneficial to the customer that this happens as trying to remove them at home can lead to damaging the item.

Yes, they are alerted to something that isn't designed to be alarmed occasionally. If it is happening to you consistently, you should realise there is something you carry that sets these things off, and should be prepared to have to show this to security from time to time. If you know it's happening then you can hardly excuse yourself as you've had ample opportunity to resolve the situation.

If it happens to you vary rarely, then what is so important that you can't spare two minutes? You say you shouldn't have to account for yourself, but you're wrong. We live in a society. Our lives are massively influenced by other people in it. The vast majority of people do not see this as unreasonable, so just because you don't agree with it doesn't mean you can opt out. If you're going to be a part of society, sometimes you just have to grit your teeth and put up with things that happen.

And before you say it (if you were inclined to do so), I'm not suggesting you should allow yourself to be mistreated, and to let serious issues in society go on 'because that's how it is'. My point is that in this case, it's not a big enough issue to fight over, and the reality is it's hardly an issue anyway, but rather a justifiable inconvenience.

&gt; Abolish the House of Lords altogether (or, more realistically, some kind of elected chamber which does not challenge supremacy of the Commons).

While I think we can all agree that the Lords needs reform, I don't believe having a second elected chamber would be a good thing, nor would removing it completely. I really like the idea of having an unelected second chamber, where members are appointed on fixed terms by an independent body, from the academic world. Politicians are politicians, they are not top level economists, scientists, industry leaders or doctors, social workers, teachers etc...There are people out there with a wealth of information that isn't being used. Having a system like this, with possible veto powers who can fully debate an issue on a level politicians never could, has the possibility to be amazing.

That said, I don't think the media would support having a second chamber that was unelected yet had power, so what would be more likely to succeed would be having single fixed terms of maybe 5-6 years. Not ever being re-elected means that you never have to worry about them having to make decisions that are popular, or appease certain groups, just so they can get elected.

Now, what about that independent body? you may ask. How about something along the lines of someone has to receive a certain number of nominations from the academic world, from universities for example.

true,[deleted],null,null,"Oh indeed, that's how in Far East Asia they have less of these problems. Intelligence is attractive and deemed positive there. My fiancée has pretty much explained it to me in depth. At school, she was popular for her intelligence.

I on the other hand was bullied for it. Here's essentially how I dealth with it:

Instead of dumbing myself down to avoid awards, I chavved myself up. I got the same grades as ever, but the heads of the school refused to award me anything because of my behaviour. I was happy about it, so I kept being both intelligent and badly behaved. I had the perks of both, and only the pitfalls of the one.

I had the most detentions, absences and exclusions in my year besides two or three other ""super chavs"".

That was in part due to my home life too, which was to say the least, catastrophic.

I was still unpopular, but I wasn't as unpopular as my well behaved best friend. He smiled as he received awards, and generally seemed proud of it, which now I look back, it was very depressing to see him wishing for others to join in with him. Instead, they took up arms against him. He was the kind of guy who wouldn't harm others, or retaliate. A truly nice guy. 

I on the other hand was the kind who would threaten to stab someone if they came within 5 foot of me. I was violent and aggressive and never got into fights, and if I did, I always won via either force, or diplomacy.

He and I were best friends, but handled our status as ""nerds"" the exact opposite. Of course, neither of our actions stopped the bullying, but he got physically attacked more, while I got verbally attacked more. The chavs were too scared that I'd pull out the knife I carried with me every where (I made sure they knew about it, since I knew about theirs) or that I'd hit them, while my friend was too kind to defend himself, so they felt little need to verbally insult him.

That pretty much sums up life in a comprehensive school in the UK. ",0,1313508313,null,0,false,0,c2cv4z9,t3_jkc9b,t1_c2cv4z9,t1_c2cutoc,1427478545,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

Apparently, geriatric care is one of the least desirable fields, right down there at the bottom of the list with psychiatry.  She said that it was often where you might end up if you couldn't get anything else.

I'm not elderly, but I've seen how elderly relatives have fared - and it has varied wildly.  One (who was not in a geriatric ward), received excellent care for a spinal injury - including continuing physiotherapy after her in-patient stay, as well as the offer of supplementary nursing at home.  

However, another - who had terminal cancer - was placed on a geriatric ward.  She received virtually no specialist care to address her cancer or the strokes she had suffered.  There were never any nurses nearby, and I saw more than one patient pleading in vain to be taken to the bathroom.  It was bad enough that visitors ended up going to the nurses' station to fetch them - as it was too far away for the patients to get to, and the nurses apparently couldn't be bothered to check on them.  Lastly - sorry to be blunt - the smell of the ward was appalling to the point of nausea.  

I've heard other nasty stories from other people: including an elderly patient left in a chair facing the wall for hours, another who was very hungry due to the quality of the meals but was too scared to ask his family to bring extra food (a nurse had apparently told him off after she saw his family bring food for him), an elderly man left sitting alone in an ambulance for 40 minutes while being taken for tests while staff went on a lunchbreak.

In my experience, big name supermarkets are only really cheaper for cheese, canned stuff and snack type food. Oh, and ready meals, but I refuse to buy them as they are overpriced for what you're actually getting. 

I also religiously check price/quantity of everything, especially the 'special deals' (three for £4, etc).

&gt;* education on voting and parliament work all through school

Yes. I didn't really get into politics until I left school, and I didn't (and still don't) feel fully educated about it. I'd LOVE to see a 'life skills' class of some sort which teaches you useful stuff in life. Managing finances, employee rights, the law, basic skills (cooking, first aid), politics (how parliament works and the major parties/figureheads) and stuff like that.

&gt;* 2nd language from 5 years old.

I've been pushing for this too for a while. The majority of Europe does it, why don't we? 

&gt;* allow kids to be smacked / humiliated again.

Within limits. If you give teachers too much power, they may abuse it. However, I do think stricter punishments should return.

&gt;* sports not done in schol time, but mandatory after school pe sessions every day. (even if its just running around a track for an hour.)

So just extend the school day by 1 hour? If it is mandatory, I see no difference at all. We really need to emphasise good health and regular exercise, especially in the school. I'd go as far to say that the current legal requirements (1 or 2 hours physical activity a week iirc) is not enough.

&gt;* ban exams - they dont reflect any real life activity, why are they used as a medium for evaluation?have practical tests of some kind instead (i'm pretty sure across the board this would help most subjects become more useful)

I think this is a knee-jerk reaction. You can use exams to test students ability to apply theory to practise e.g. in sciences and maths. You can also use them to encourage students to learn scientific and mathematical facts; some people do not have a proper mathematical and scientifical understanding, to their detriment (in my opinion). 

I fully agree that exams should NOT be the sole factor in evaluating or comparing a child's progress, but scrapping them will do just as much harm as good.

&gt;* ban faith schools

Again, knee-jerk. Don't ban them, just force them to take on all students, religious or not. However, I also believe that children should be learning ABOUT religion rather than practising it in school; religion is a personal choice and a 10 year old is not well informed enough to make that decision.

---

I also feel that in general, your ideas about religion are a bit harsh. I'm an atheist, but not allowing them to vote, excessively taxing them (tax them as a business, not a charity imo) and trying to 'disgrace' priests and the like infringes on their right to free speech and fair treatment. 

I agree that Jewish courts and Sharia courts should be abolished; being a member of a religion should not allow citizens to avoid proper legal process.

Spoilers for AGMGTW:
[I'd love to know if the very last shot in the episode of Amy and Rory was them genuinely reacting to River's revelation.  With the dummy ending for the readthrough, it seems the intent was to have as real a reaction as possible, and looking at that shot now, it looks heartbreaking.  Karen at the end is devastating.  Then again, Arthur does the continental drift thing with his scalp that he keeps doing at moments of high emotion, so maybe it was more acting than shock.

true,DogBotherer,null,null,"&gt;I don't think that is a particularly healthy way of thinking about socialism. 

Why not - it's the very essence of socialism.

&gt;The implication is that anything bad done in the name of socialism is therefore inauthentic socialism.

No, that's a no true Scotsman argument.  I'm not saying people who believe this but do that aren't socialists.  Self-identified socialists have done some bad shit over the years, as have communists, capitalists, republicans, conservatives, monarchists, democrats and anarchists.  I'm talking about what the core ideology is.

&gt;It seems more useful to follow Žižek's approach and explore how Lenin and Stalin reflected authentic manifestations of socialism and to query how to not recreate those structures in the future.

You'll need to elaborate, I'm not familiar with Žižek.  It all sounds a bit metaphysical at present.  If you mean simply that they did it badly and here's how we could do it better, I'm not into that sort of Trotskyist/Leninist reinterpretation of the revolution.  It wasn't just an oops, it was a fundamental flaw which went to the heart of the ideology and resulted directly and indirectly in hideous numbers of deaths and ultimately delivered nothing.  It's not the ""only successful"" revolution to study, it was a failed revolution because it didn't deliver.

I've just moved back to the UK after living in Galway for 6 years, and there, every town and city *must* have at least one  traveller encampment area by law. Most cities in Ireland have several, and to save the NIMBY attitudes over planning, the councils make the decision without public consultation. 

As it is, Galway has 4 traveller sites currently, and one of them was just up the road from where we lived. 

The only really negative effect of having them nearby was that it could affect property values.  

All in all, I never had problems with them, they tended to police themselves, and the community got along well with them. If anything, the council estate next to the site had a lot more problem tenants, and it was well known to the Gardai. 

One of the things they all had, with being permanent encampment areas, was toilet facilities for each single caravan siting plot. (There was marked out organised areas for each caravan, with electrical pay-as-you-go hook-ups).

I personally reckon the UK should put laws in place to actually provide proper encampment areas for Romanies/travellers/gypsies, as Ireland has done. ",0,1313522396,null,0,false,0,c2cx99e,t3_jij27,t1_c2cx99e,t3_jij27,1427479604,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

I'm not a conservative thinking person, but I do think when there's a strong level of belief that a crime has been committed, the people who are in charge of protecting the store should be able to act, at least to force a search and detain if required until the police show up.

As for the demand, that should only be necessary when a refusal is made to a request. I'm all for civilised behaviour. Again, I just don't see how being to walk out with no restraint is possible.

As for people who are innocent? Take the two minutes to prove it. As I said earlier, security don't pick people out for fun.

Have a hypothetical for the further-down-the-line instance. Maybe, due to a certain camera angle or whatever, it does look exactly like you slipped something in your bag. You get stopped by security before leaving but refuse to be searched and walk away. The police are called and they find and charge you, and the evidence looks legitimate.

You are right in that you as the original taker retain full copyright, by uploading it to twitpic it does not mean it is in the public domain. All that tweeting the picture does it provide a sign post to it. It would be like me putting a sign up saying ""Yard sale, turn right at end of road"" and then someone stealing the TV from my house because I had given them leave to come on my property.

The only problem here is that you also grant twitpic a licence to further distribute the image to any media outlet. However if they do this they have to also credit twitpic:

"" whether online, in print publication, television, or any other format, you are required to obtain permission from Twitpic in advance of said usage and attribute credit to Twitpic as the source where you have obtained the content. ""

But they don't do that, they attribute you directly. If I was you I would approach a lawyer as you have a civil case against them here. You have evidence that you denied them permission and they recognise the copyright. 

Here in the uk copyright is implicit. Meaning you do not have to claim or mark the work to assert your copyright. It just becomes more difficult to prove it was yours in the first place.


By the way did you add the copyright in the bottom left corner? because if not I would guess they have also made a derivative work which you certainly did not permit.

tl;dr Send email to original requester saying you did not give permission, if they do remove the pictures you will start civil proceedings. CC in the editor, managing director and any address you can find at Associated Newspapers Ltd their publisher. Also consider contacting another newspaper or news outlet they love bashing on other companies. If it is wide spread as it says in the article provide them with a nice list of evidence.

&gt;Actually, this isn’t so much because of the difference in data source; it’s mainly a function of the particular countries that drop out when switching to the LIS data. The association in Wilkinson and Pickett’s chart rests heavily on the position of Japan, Singapore, and Portugal, none of which are in the LIS database.

He also says that the dataset used in the book isn't a bad choice (albeit not as good as the LIS data). He finally concludes by saying that he's not certain that they are (the authors of the Spirit Level) wrong.

true,anonymouslemming,null,null,"Wow ... I'm quite scared by the level of ignorance shown about photographic restrictions, copyright law, the public domain and a few other things here. 

Thanks to the Berne convention, anything you create (including every picture you ever take) is covered by copyright, and you own the copyright. The only day-to-day exception to this is if you are creating a work for hire (someone has commissioned you and directed you to create a work, and you have agreed that they will own the rights to it). See http://www.ipo.gov.uk/c-about-faq-unofficial.htm for more about this.

The public domain is a specific legal term. You have to explicitly state that you rescind any rights to the work and that you are placing it in the public domain. See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_domain for more. Just posting it somewhere is not releasing it into the public domain - that is **publishing** it and you retain all rights. In some cases, you may give additional rights to anyone that you use to publish your image, but you still retain copyright of the image. 

I see a lot of discussion about whether or not the DM could have got the image from Twitpic based on their Ts &amp; Cs. Even if this were the case, DM still violated *that* agreement by removing the attribution. Furthermore, they violated copyright by lifting the author's comments from another blog / paper and publishing them without attribution too.

With regards to permission to photograph something, you do not need any permission especially if done for reporting permissions. We're not a completely authoritarian state just yet. There are exceptions to this, primarily if you are on private property and there are clear signs stating that the owner of the property does not allow photography. This isn't a special photography law - this is covered by the same law by which a shopping mall can ban farting if they desire (undesirable / anti-social behaviour I guess for farting). If this picture was taken from a sidewalk / pavement, there is no recourse against the photographer. Even if it was taken from inside a mall, it is **very** unlikely that Gap own the part of the mall where the photograph was taken from, so it would be up to the owner of the property to pursue the photographer. That's unlikely though, and still doesn't change the fact that the photographer owns the copyright on the image until she loses it based on a court decision in favour of the property owner (NOT Gap!).",0,1313529545,null,0,false,0,c2cyca0,t3_jkn97,t1_c2cyca0,t3_jkn97,1427480123,28,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,28

5) I'm assuming this included the ""lost"" episodes. How did you watch those? Fan reconstructions?

6) Is there anything you'd like to recommend to watch for people who haven't taken the plunge in to the original series?

7) Is there anything you'd like to recommend to people who want to watch all the episodes in the future?

No, a child is not informed enough... but a parent should be. There has to be the option for parents to raise their children as they see fit, rather than teachers raising your children for you.

true,Pyrix,english,Reading,"Why would it all have to be introduced at once? A few policies here and there over a few decades and this is certainly realistic not idealistic (apart from the last point, sadly). Especially if emulated in other major economies to prevent tax tourism and change the environment in which business has to operate across the world. 

The argument about people moving away with high tax rates doesn't really stick for me because otherwise why do any countries or rich people operate in places like Scandinavia where the top rates of tax hit 60%? Especially if other incentives like a highly skilled and educated workforce can be offered to them. 

On a different point, I would challenge your use of 'liberal'. Socially liberal, yes, but economically liberal, not really. Economic liberalism is essentially free markets (a tendency shown by the 'Orange Bookers' in the Lib Dems). Many of those policies like nationalisation, mutualisation and co-operatives are values more to be found on the left, and people are more likely to be after that than as you say a 'liberal' government. I would self-describe this list as leftist not 'liberal'. You are probably buying into the American dichotomy of 'liberal' and 'conservative' which for the most part has replaced left and right even if it is unhelpful.

How do I risk giving so much power to the people? The electoral system changes a bit, an unelected chamber is abolished, and a President is elected as in many countries. Political power would still work in a broadly similar way to now. People may have more economic power, sure, in terms of having a stake in their employer's business and in society, but if anything that would mean they were better able to deal with a financial crisis, not to mention the fact that what caused this specific crisis would be dealt with some way by the splitting up of savings and investment banks and the heavy regulation of the latter.

On the point of a 'compelte cultural/social revolution', surely this is what we are after to fix a 'Broken Britain'?. I don't agree with the term at all by the way, Britain is by no means broken, but it's a useful opening gambit for some discussion.

1) Hell yeah I watched them in air date order. If you make the decision to watch the show, that's really the best way. Picking and choosing ""best"" episodes hurts the way you'll be able to appreciate them because of the context that comes from the developed relationship with the Doctor and his companions (Caves of Androzani, for example).

2) Oh boy. I liked the Aztecs with Hartnell because it was the first episode that really humanized him, The Mind Robber with Troughton because of the fantastic whimsy of it, Carnival of Monsters with Pertwee, though I really loved Pertwee's Doctor for so much, this one really just took silliness and turned it absurd, The Invasion of Time with Baker, who had more great episodes than anyone else (and more years), Caves of Androzani for Peter Davison, who I also *really* loved as the Doctor, Mindwarp for Colin Baker because he and Peri finally felt like they had the swing of things, Paradise Towers with McCoy because it was *soooo* 80's, The Movie with McGann because duh, Father's Day with Eccleston because it demonstrated what modern minds would do with time travel, The Girl in the Fireplace with David Tennant because it's such a beautiful love tragedy, and I'm holding out on answering for Matt Smith, because his best may be yet to come.

3) I wanted to watch some of the classic episodes and realized that I didn't want to go by someone else's list of what the best is. My entire list in answer #2 was pulled out of my ass and you shouldn't just follow it. It's better to see for yourself why the show is so great.

4) 6 months or more. I don't remember. There was a lot of poop in my pants when I was done.

5) I saw some of the fan reconstruction stuff and listened to some episodes, but I simply didn't have the patience for it. The lost episodes are lost to me.

6) Do it from the start. Don't watch ""the great episodes"" because that's like chugging a fine wine. It's meant to be appreciated more than to simply be consumed.

7) Enjoy the ride and do it slowly. It looks like a lot when you start, but when you're finished, you only have the new episodes to be introduced to you in the future. Well, unless you're going for the novels and stuff, but there should really be a point at which you stop being a nerd.

The CCTV would hold up to a greater extent, however the person under suspicion would have to be under surveillance constantly until they left the store and there would have to be no point at which they could have put down the item you believe to be stolen.

&gt;Why would it all have to be introduced at once? A few policies here and there over a few decades and this is certainly realistic not idealistic (apart from the last point, sadly). Especially if emulated in other major economies to prevent tax tourism and change the environment in which business has to operate across the world.

There will be changes over the years. But what you suggest is a single entity approach. If we were ruled by a despot, it would be a possibility that they could make such major changes over time. Labour had 13 years, and most of what they did is being over turned due to a lack of satisfaction with their actions and different thinking from others.

I agree with you, Britain isn't broken. So why would we need to change things that would have major effects on the parts that aren't 'broken'.

The focus needs to stay on whats wrong with society, not on what you don't agree with but works. For example, how would removing the Royal Family in place of a president be any better? You're not only changing the nature of our government, you'd be changing the name of the country. And for what? The Prime Minister pretty much runs the show as it currently is. What difference would it make if he was President as opposed to PM?

Personally, I think we are beyond these types of change now anyway without some kind of major event (WW3, complete market crash). ",0,1313534683,null,0,false,0,c2cz0l9,t3_jkc9b,t1_c2cz0l9,t1_c2cytjl,1427480505,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

true,Jamaicaman90,cnty-wales,Swansea,"Ok, you've given me a few replies, so I'll condense it all here as you seem to be making a similar point each time.

Legally, security have the right to detain you, using reasonable force if necessary, anyone who they **believe** to be stealing from their store. The key part here is belief; they do not need to be 100% certain, but at the same time they need to be more than just suspicious. They need to justifiably have an authentic belief that the person is committing a crime.

Ethics is a subjective subject, but I am of the opinion that it is not breaking any ethical standard. People like to take advantage; the riots have shown that with certain individuals out to get what they can for themselves. The line has to be drawn somewhere, and I think the current system is the most fair for everybody.

The exit alarms going off for me is reliable enough to use it as a means of asking customers for a brief inspection of the source. they don't go through everything; they test each bag individually quickly, and then the usual cause is a forgotten security tag which can then be removed saving the customer a great deal of annoyance later. Chances are you'll benefit from complying rather than walking away.

So no, legally he can be apprehended by security for continuing and increasing the belief of the security that he is stealing. Ethically, in my opinion, the security are justified in doing so. What do you expect of a security guard who already believes the person may be shoplifting, and they refuse to cooperate in resolving the situation in an incredibly short amount of time?",0,1313538081,null,0,false,0,c2czfct,t3_jkbxq,t1_c2czfct,t1_c2czclo,1427480692,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

DO NOT, start with first doctor.  Start with third and then go in order through the other classic doctors. There are many good reasons for this that will make the experience easier for the New Who only types.

The general guidelines are seen directly by the guard (not CCTV) and direct line of sight on that person for the entire time between the incident and leaving the store.

Also even if the guard has a legal right to detain them the person has a legal right to defend themselves with reasonable force. Which means I'm entirely entitled to shake off any attempted restraint and to escalate if the guard does. In such circumstance if he hits me it would be assault while if I hit him in return it is reasonable defence.

So yeah the guard has the right to detain the suspect if he has a compelling case but has no legal tools to actually enforce that. Even if I were a shop lifter the guard will end up in far more trouble than I would if I force the issue.

It seems excessive but I really don't like this ""random irrelevant people will infringe on your time for their benefit"" tendency.

The destruction he causes is too much though, so River goes back in time to kill Doctor 11 permanently before he can regenerate, changing the course of time. They are then able to revive the doctor (just like the Master was revived after he was dead. They cremated him but then used magic science to bring him back to life). With the course of time changed, they then set out on their next adventure, with River redeemed. Unfortunately she is still brainwashed, and causes an accident meant to kill the Doctor.

The only people who would suffer in reality would be the moderately rich who don't have to ability to shift their funds to tax havens. Those who can, will move away to protect their funds.

Every time I see or hear this I kinda think ""yeah, well, good riddance to them"". That might well be a shallow reaction, but ultimately we can make it so that you can't leave the country and continue to make money out of Britain.

""They'll take their money and leave"" seems like a Tory narrative to me. We should be working on a worldview in which the rich *expect* to pay a fair tax, and consider it part and a cost of living in a decent society - they should be thinking ""we want to pay tax because it's for the good of the country"". That may sound naive, but it seems to be much closer to the attitude in place like the Netherlands and Scandinavia.

At the end of the day, this ""they'll take their money and leave"" narrative seems to stem from the fact that the Tories (and New Labour were just the same) don't *want* to tax their rich friends - it's not based on any facts or studies or basic principles of fairness, it's just a case of ""we don't want to do it"".",0,1313547922,null,0,false,0,c2d0jbh,t3_jkc9b,t1_c2d0jbh,t1_c2cynq7,1427481216,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

I think he is under a great deal of pressure and I think at times, some of his teammates do nothing to help him with the constant long ball drivel being aimed at his head.

At times he appears sluggish, ungainly and the complete oppisite of elegent on the ball but he gets results and at the end of the day when the ball is in the back of the net, you won't find anyone complaining.

At the moment he reminds me a bit of Oliver Bierhoff and Duncan Fergurson(Please don't lynch me), and I'm not particurely referencing the size of the lads but the way they appeared to get the ball in somehow, bustling through defenders to get to the goal.

Mind you Carroll has the ability to hit one from range as well, as we found out against Newcastle, and City got a first hand display of.

I think he is a good purchase, being English and young. As other clubs slowly begin to struggle with the new laws regarding foreign players, we will be have an adavantage with English players like Carroll, Downing, Henderson and Adam(correct me if i'm wrong about Scots being eligible). Obviusely, the laws only really affect the ""traditional"" top 4 and Man City, with United, Arsenal,Liverpool, Chelsea and City the biggest non-English culprits.

Now here's the radical part, I would play Carroll as a withdrawn striker and Suarez as the out-and-out. Carroll is a little weak on pace, playing him in this position allows him to be the pivot player, holding up the play or knocking down long balls for Suarez. Suarez has always played as the out and out strikers for Uruguay, as well as last season for Liverpool and I think this is his best position. In the event that the ball is played down the flanks, there will still be time for Carroll to get into the box for the cross. 

Kuyt is necessary on the right to bolster the defensive qualities of our midfield. Downing on the left as usual. 

In the second half, when Suarez is tired, take him out for Gerrard or Meireles and have Carroll switch places with the sub. If possible, switch Aquilani for Adam too.

At the time it seemed like Newcastle were negotiating with Chelsea, rather than us, so it's more like we sold Torres for £15m + Carroll. That seems like decent business if Carroll's form for the barcodes last autumn turns out to be representative, and especially if Torres remains a shadow of his former self.

What I am concerned about is how well he fill fit into the team. A few seasons back we had a freakishly tall centre forward and a talented attacking midfield. Our main tactic seemed to be to lump the ball over the heads of the latter for Crouch (the only man in the world who gets shorter when he jumps) to lose.

Now Carroll is a better target man than Crouch, but are we going to revert to long ball football? Or are we going to ignore Carroll's major strengths and expect him to play intricate passes with Suarez?

For a long time in the Houllier and Benitez years, we bought and sold a lot of players but it never really seemed that we had a squad that Rafa could shape into a functional team. We were always missing a centre forward or left back, and at no point had genuine width. At the same time we would have a glut of attacking midfielders who wanted to play in the space behind the striker(s).

It is my hope that the recent transfer policy has been conducted with some sort of plan in mind - that Dalglish and Comolli are working together to build a team, rather than just signing a bunch of decent players from which to pick a team.

16th August 2011 at Manchester Crown Court

""I have considered whether one can seek to apply the definitive guidelines of the recently established Sentencing Council or its predecessor Sentencing Guidelines Council where they exist (and they do so for offences of assault, robbery, burglary of commercial premises and theft).""

""I have also had regard to the generic guidelines, such as those relating to discounts for guilty pleas. The guidelines of the Sentencing Council (which thus far relate to offences of assault) must be followed unless the judge gives reasons for not doing so. In the case of the guidelines of its predecessor, I am required to have regard to them, but may depart from them.""

""Lest there be any doubt in the minds of the media, I have received no advice from anyone in Government or within the Court Service or anywhere else on how I am to treat the Guidelines for the purposes of these cases. **Had I done so, I would have ignored it.** ""

Dickens though it's hardly that (not in this country which is what we're talking about), Orwell yes we are in another recession, but now we the state shoring things up, so no-one needs to starve.
You mention Delta team, should I infer from that you're American?
Yes sometimes you have to take a shit job to pay the bills, sometimes you could do with a better wage, and yes the people at the top are arseholes that have screwed us all. But poverty is being in a tin shack with a bag of rice to feed your family for a month. People in this country  are poor granted, but it doesn't excuse the behavior, steal food if you really need it ok, steal something because you want extra or a better version that's greed.
Brutality because if you want more money than the state will give you for free you might have to work, look at the rest of the world, how can you possibly call it brutality?
Draconian legislation, what do you refer to, which particular law?
Self-autonomy would mean you'd have to work for yourself not someone else. Dignity, there is far more dignity in working (even at a shit job) than being on the social.
These people have options to learn or not to, to work or not to, to be criminals or not to.

If you seriously think that people nowadays are living in anything like the conditions of Dickens, you've been misled (unless you're referring to the elderly who are hard done by).

You can always leave a job if it's that bad you don't literally have to stay, the state will make sure you don't starve (unless of course you choose to spend that money on other things). Those kids being forced into gangs by their peers, that I can see being comparable to slavery, and those instances of immigrants bringing people over from their home country to literally keep as slaves.
Capitalism isn't perfect very true, but what's the alternatives, and don't say Communism I've some good friends who grew up in soviet Russia that paint a very, very different view.
Never seen how the world works, I grew up with a single disabled mother (who I was carer for) in the seventies, we'd get debtors chasing us (she COULD'NT work), we'd no heating would get ice inside the windows in winter , we'd buy clothes from jumble sales. My kids spent the first 15 years of their lives in the same situation, but we never turned to crime, we worked to make it better (still not even well of by any stretch) and none of us consider ourselves to have been poverty stricken. Hard up yes, poverty no.

Bringing her back again after her nice happy(ish) ending with Human Doctor would just dilute the character further.

It'll be different if they do a multi-Doctor special for the 50th anniversary. Then it might be nice to see different companions interacting with each other/different Doctors. But having them show up for every finale really limits the show IMO.

true,terahurts,eng-lincolnshire,"Cleethorpes, definitely not Grimsby","Two mildly relevant stories from my past:

Story the first; As a spotty teenager I used to work part-time for at a catalogue companies warehouse picking stock for shipping to customers.  On leaving the premises either for lunch or at the end of the day security would randomly grab a dozen or so people and take them off to be searched.  A proper strip-to-your-undies search.  Refusing would get you fired (written into your contract). I had it happen to me a couple of times during the few years I worked there.  I didn't have much of a problem with it, I'd read the contract and listened to the staff induction stuff,  but some people would go absolutely bonkers over it.  

Story the second; A few years ago I was 'detained' by a security guard in Sainburys for 'being threatening'.  My fiancée and myself were queuing in the ciggy counter line when a gentlemen shoved his was past us, knocking my wife over - she's got a degenerative nerve problem in the her back and was using a walking stick.  I was understandably a little peeved, especially when said gentleman ignored her and continued to push up the queue.  I politely pointed out that he'd knocked my fiancée over and suggested he should apologise.  He decided he'd rather give me a mouthful of Fuck you's. I start to get a little in his face (no violence, or shoving etc, just some 'What the fuck did you just say?' type comments and then a wild security guard appears, who pushed us apart.   I'm expecting security to ask the gentleman to leave, but instead he shoves me out of the queue.  Now I'm 6'2"" and apparently look a little bit scary (actually a total wuss unless I'm seriously wound up), even though I'm trying to hold my fiancée upright, so I can kind of understand why security thinks it's a good idea to move me rather than the other gentleman who's about 5'5"" and looks like catweasle, but the guard has basically grabbed both my arms - one of which is holding the GF up - and is trying to drag me out of the store.  So I tell him calmly that I'm quite prepared to discuss what just happened but he better take his hands off me right now.  He keeps trying to pull me and I put the brakes on, telling him he has no right to touch me, and that he's endangering my GF since she's struggling to walk after being knocked over by catweasle.  He tells me he's not going to let go of me until I leave the store I tell him very loudly I'm not leaving until a manager asks me to since I have done nothing wrong.  I'm assuming that someone on the customer service desk has by this point called their manager because there's suddenly two more guards and a very worried looking guy in a suit standing around us.  Guard #1 is at this point inches from my face threatening to have me arrested, so I tell him to go ahead and call the police since I want to make a complaint of assault against him.  The manager sensibly gets guards #2 and #3 to take #1 off somewhere and asks me what's going on.  I explain the situation with corroboration from the cashiers on the ciggy counter and customer service who both say that Catweasle is a known shoplifter and is always causing trouble with other customers.  Manager asks if I'm OK and I tell him I'm really angry with how we've been treated and I'm worried my GF is hurt.  He takes us off the coffee shop, gets us both a drink and apologies profusely whilst writing everything down.   

A couple of days later my GF gets a huuuuge bunch of flowers delivered from the store along with a written apology, some vouchers and assurances that the guard had been disciplined.  Net result, a retained customer for Sainburys and a couple of hundred quid in free shopping for us.  At the time I was seriously pissed off with the way the guard let the situation get out of control, but looking back I can see that he wasn't aware that my gf had been knocked over and basically saw a situation where a rather tall and imposing man was shouting at someone who looked like he'd spent the night in a hedge.  He didn't know who or what had started the argument and wanted to get as much distance between me and catweasel as possible, he made a judgement call and unfortunately picked the wrong person to remove.

That way we can combine investment with a means of steadily lowering the deficit (nationalising the crisis-affected banks permanently might also help, as we won't get much return on the shares if it is known that the government wants rid of them as soon as possible).

Damn.
Unless you have something like 4 or 5 essays to write at the same time, for a first year degree that looks pretty damn harsh. Traditional marking shifts the weighting on to your second and third years.

Anyway, you have 2 days to do 14,000 words. That is easier than you think. As of this post, you have about 48 hours. If you give a damn about your degree, then you'll try finish it since you'll be paying for it for the rest of your life and you will not get a third chance at any other degree.

I dropped out in my second year initially because of a variety of family problems and stuff at home, I wasn't able to focus on my work and it was dragging my grades down. For the next 6 years without a degree I was jumping between low paid positions and temp work, spending more time on jobseekers than anything else. I can tell you now it was shite. If you have an ounce of sense, not meaning to be offensive but you will get your shit together and work on your degree so at least you have SOMETHING. 

Otherwise, your record is going to reflect that you've had 1 or 2 years out from work that you can't account for without saying that you've failed University twice and you've got no work experience or references that can account for you being capable.

Sit down, get the books, the paper and the willpower together and finish what you started, because if you don't, you'll have permanent outgoings hanging over your head for something you never ended up getting. What's the point of that?

If it's so bad, why not just knock out something that's rushed and go speak to a lecturer and tell them you're struggling?

Large government debt is only problematic when the people that own the debt doubt the country's ability to repay. The UK is not even close to that yet. When times are good, debt is easy to repay. Unemployment, however, is slow and difficult to reverse. 

And let's not forget the paradox of thrift: reducing government spending results in increased unemployment. Less people getting paid means less people paying income tax, which means less government revenue. More unemployed also means more people on the dole and drawing numerous other provisions for unemployed people, thereby increasing government expenditure.

Yeah, you are absolutely right on the debt, it's more the deficit that is troubling. I agree with you that unemployment is worse though, as it has much more real-world, long-term effects.

That is right too about thrift. And once you add other effects like globalisation driving down corporation tax and wages/employment (and so income tax) causing cuts which then worsens inequality and the loss of consumer demand (causing a loss in VAT), worsening the recession and so increasing the strain on government services - it really does seem hopeless to resolve without major changes. 

But what can be changed? The corporations have to compete for the lowest taxes and lowest wages or else they would just be outcompeted by other businesses that did so - besides, what about the ultimate outsourcing - automation? No-one would claim that we shouldn't automate menial work, and yet at the moment if we do so we will only worsen our troubles of unemployment and economic crises.

That is, you get the greatest possible output for a given input. It is through global trade and technological improvements to the means of production that globally people have far more material wealth and a better quality of life than they did 100 years ago.

The bad thing about global capitalism is that it creates an undesirable *distribution* of wealth. Everyone acknowledges that: it is exactly and precisely because of the way capitalism distributes wealth that taxes exist.

I think the best way for the UK to proceed is to increase *progressive* taxes like the income tax. An additional top rate, instead of getting rid of the current top rate. The richer someone is, the smaller their *marginal propensity to consume*.

FTFY. Education should be about a dialogue and an exchange of ideas. If a lecturer only had to impart facts then he doesn't need to be there, he could just as well hand out fact sheets (which is what the national curriculum is and it seems the same for a Bachelor's degree). I went to university to meet bright and eager mindes, and all I got was this lousy hoody... or something like that.

The lecturers actually asked and encouraged questions. It got so bad that one lecturer stopped taking answers from the 'usual suspects' as he put it, and for other lectures I think we just gave up. That's not to even mention the Chinese students with sub-GCSE english. They were there to be utterly milked and be guaranteed a minimum pass. Standards are ridiculously low.

2) Who could we have got for 35m this season? For example, Aguero cost 35m. Not saying that he would have come to Liverpool, but this is just to show that in this age of huge transfer fees, 35m is still enough to buy a young yet already established world-class star.

true,ax4of9,null,null,"A few questions: At that point in January, before Suarez had played a single game for Liverpool, did you know that 

A) Carroll was going to be injured for most of the rest of the season with a thigh injury on top of his knee injury? 

B) Suarez would strike up a great partnership with Kuyt and end up demolishing Man Utd?

One more question, but this is not limited to last year January: Did you actually read my post? Carroll was a replacement for Torres. Instead of saying that Liverpool bought Carroll, it is more apt to imagine Chelsea buying Carroll and giving him to us plus a cheque of £15 million so that they can get Torres. Does this mean that if Carroll was free, Torres would have only cost £15 million? Yes. Therefore, the number 35 is moot. 

By selling Torres, Liverpool would have had only 2 strikers: Suarez and Ngog. Ngog is a back-up and has been proven to be not good enough. Suarez, at that point, was an unknown. (If you mention Kuyt, please remember that he also had duties as the right midfielder.) Another striker was needed. Since Chelsea was willing to bankroll the transfer, Dalglish probably had a few requirements for the replacement: Young, Homegrown, and most importantly, Offers a Different Dimension from Suarez. 


Why did the replacement have to offer a different dimension from Suarez? Because at this point, Dalglish was probably as unsure as you or I. At the time when Carroll was signed, Dalglish had only been at the helm for 5 games, of which only 2 games had been played. He needed to make sure that he would have a different option if Suarez did not work out. This different option was Carroll. So we did have had to buy him. I'm not sure if you can name many players who qualify the requirements of Young, Homegrown and Offers a different dimension from Suarez. 


Now for your second question: Could we have waited to use this money better? For this question to be valid, Liverpool would have had to sell Torres on the final day of the January window and be left with Ngog and Suarez. Again, 1 is only a back-up while the other was an unknown. But since you state that Carroll was largely injured for the remainder of the season (a fact nobody would have known in January), I will entertain your question. Firstly, it is highly unlikely that Chelsea would have paid 50 million for Torres had we not been in the market for a replacement. If Chelsea had known that we did not NEED a replacement, or did not intend to buy a replacement, they would not have paid £50 million for Torres. The £50 million was a number that Liverpool negotiated with Chelsea to be £15 million + the price of the replacement (Carroll). Why wouldn't they? Because Liverpool were desperate to sell him. At that time, Torres was a dejected figure, unmotivated, injury prone, and had sent in a transfer request. If Liverpool did not sell Torres in January, he would have likely gone for less by the end of the season. By sending in a transfer request, Torres made it so that Liverpool had to sell him. 


So at this point, I have already established that Torres had to be sold, and that a replacement had to be found at that time, and also what requirements the replacement was expected to possess. To be honest, I can't think of ANYBODY other than Carroll who fulfills these requirements. But let us say that I pulled these qualities out of my ass (which I did for the third one. Dalglish's need for young-ish homegrown players is evident to all). Let us consider who else Liverpool could have bought. I can't think of anyone. I am assuming that you are thinking of an already established world-class star. No team will sell their already-established yet young world-class star in the middle of the season with no time to find a replacement. In fact, even though you may think that Carroll is far from being established or world-class, the only reason Newcastle sold Carroll was because Mike Ashley is a greedy pig. I doubt very much that Valencia would have let go of Mata at the time when they were fighting for third in La Liga. I also seriously doubt that Aguero would have left Atletico in the lurch in the middle of the season. Kun only left Atletico to Man City for two reasons, money and Champion's League football. 

Satisfied? No? Let me lengthen this essay further and prolong the painful wall of text: What if Liverpool received £50 million for Torres from Chelsea and did not buy a replacement? (Notice how this question overturns many of my earlier points, but again, I wanted to entertain your questions) Let us assume that we had £50 million for Torres, did not buy Carroll, and ended the season in the same place: 6th. And let us assume that we now had £35 million to spend on a striker. 

If all other things are equal, we still would not have gotten Aguero. AFAIK, Aguero is getting somewhere between £120k to £150k p/w at City. That is DOUBLE what we are paying Carroll now, if I'm not mistaken. We might be willing to pay £35 million for Aguero, but are we willing to pay him another £35 million in wages over 5 years? Even if we were, remember that we are NOT in the Champion's League. He wouldn't have come. 

Who else, then? Most of the world-class strikers in Europe now are on pretty lengthy contracts, or will likely cost more than £35 million, or will refuse to come to Liverpool. Most of them will be playing Champion's League, which we don't have. We don't even have Europa! 

If by now, you are still NOT convinced, then I will ask you one final question: 

Can you please name another relatively young striker who is BETTER than Carroll and would realistically come to Liverpool for £35 million? You can name up to 3 if you like. ",0,1313594958,null,0,false,0,c2d4h4t,t3_jl2fo,t1_c2d4h4t,t1_c2d3y4s,1427483072,2,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,2

true,Gaz133,null,null,"Aguero's wages are way higher than Carroll's and Liverpool wouldn't have been able to pay them even if they'd gotten the transfer fee together. It's not relevant to compare the two. At the time, Liverpool's management was losing it's marquee player in it's first transfer window and had to make a statement that they weren't only going to be a selling team. They wanted to get in the best young striker they could immediately if they were going to lose Torres as a mark of intent if nothing else. How would you have felt coming out of that transfer window if no one else had been bought? Much like Arsenal fans feel right now I would surmise. 

You can't compare transfer fees like they are each set in stone as what a player is actually worth. The transfer fee reflects the market for the player of which a lot has to go into including age, contract, and necessity. Barcelona got Cesc Fabregas at a tremendous discount because they were only bidding against themselves and they didn't really need him. Arsenal were forced to sell because the player wanted to leave and his situation with Arsenal had become untenable. Newcastle didn't want to sell Andy Carroll in January but were obliged to because of the huge fee that Liverpool were paying. 

So sure, Liverpool could have sat on the money and tried to find value later on, but who's to say they would find anything better? There is no Champions League so the top top players would not be so eager to come to Liverpool and they can't pay top top wages like Man City can so who would they have gotten that's better than Carroll?

Some large percentage of the population have herpes of one sort or another, most I guess because their partner didn't warn them. Would you recommend they all report their 'attacker'?

If you think this couldn't happen imagine that this girl (and the next) will now probably be in line for a payout from the criminal compensation fund... This is a bad interpretation of the law.

&gt;This ignores that Carroll will cost an additional £21m in wages over 5 years, whereas Aguero will cost an additional £52m! People kept saying that we just get rid of Cole and Jovanovic (done) and we can find the £200k a week, ignoring the knock-on effect of obliterating a wage structure which, I believe, has the top earner (Gerrard) on £130k a week. Add the fact that Aguero left Atleti in search of regular CL football, and it’s a pointless comparison (though it didn’t stop people making it!).
&gt;
&gt;For those who don’t use Twitter, my summation:
&gt;
&gt;(1/4) Liverpool’s best players may like to earn £200k a week, but they accept the pay structure/realities at the club. However…
&gt;
&gt;…(2/4) If #LFC suddenly paid someone £200k a week, then Reina, Gerrard, Suarez, et al, would *have* to be given pay rises.
&gt;
&gt;… (3/4) Then gap to mid-range internationals grows. So *they* would want pay rise, to narrow an unfair gap, or unrest ensues
&gt;
&gt;…(4/4) One new player can then have a knock-on effect, costing £millions more a month. Therefore – wage structure is sacrosanct

true,ax4of9,null,null,"Yeah, but Carroll won't be trying to do the same things as Forlan does. 

Long ball - Carroll can knock it down for Suarez, or any of the wingers, or the advancing midfielder. 

Low ball - Carroll can turn and shoot if he has space. If not, he can again hold up the ball for the advancing midfielder, who will be able to pick out Suarez or shoot or pass to the wingers. If Carroll draws away 1 defensive midfielder, and Suarez draws away 1 defender, Aquilani/Meireles/Gerrard will only have to face 1 defender. 

Forlan usually takes the ball out of midfield by himself and spreads the passes. In other words, he works as both the attacking playmaker AND as the false 9. 

Putting him in a withdrawn position will give everybody a lot more to work with. He will be closer to the midfield, so he has a couple extra options on his knockdowns. Suarez will be hassling the opposition defense, which is what he does best. If the ball goes to the wingers, he can switch with Suarez immediately, Carroll to the far post, Suarez to the near post but slightly further from the goal. 

In our last match against Sunderland, he was literally standing at the far post waiting for the cross. This isn't a good thing, because he will have no momentum and it is easier for the defender to mark him. If he is running in towards the far post, the defender will find it very hard to both keep up with him AND win the header.

It was well-known that he'd be injured for weeks, after which he'd need to get back to his fitness and only then would he be able to start getting gametime. I believe it was widely expected that of the 3.5 months left at that point, he wouldn't get back to full fitness for at least 1.5 of them. 

&gt; B) Suarez would strike up a great partnership with Kuyt and end up demolishing Man Utd?

I didn't know that, but I'm not the manager nor in any way in charge of transfers, and neither are you. Whose job was it to know that Kuyt was going to fit into the system a lot better than Carroll, and should they have known or predicted that? 

&gt; One more question, but this is not limited to last year January: Did you actually read my post? Carroll was a replacement for Torres. Instead of saying that Liverpool bought Carroll, it is more apt to imagine Chelsea buying Carroll and giving him to us plus a cheque of £15 million so that they can get Torres. Does this mean that if Carroll was free, Torres would have only cost £15 million? Yes. Therefore, the number 35 is moot.

I read your post and I disagreed with all of it. Because obviously it doesn't work like that. Chelsea wouldn't have paid 200 million for Torres had Newcastle requested 185. Hyperbole, yes, but to make a point. Chelsea were willing to pay 50m for Torres (at least; maybe we should have pressed for more?). Hadn't Newcastle asked for 35m and had we been willing to accept less for Torres, then we simply would have not been very good in the negotiations. Chelsea were willing to pay us 50 because they did. Let's stop right there and then. We got 50m for Torres. That Newcastle played any part in these negotiations is insignificant. What we did with that money in no way concerns Chelsea or Torres. We were also under no legal obligation to spend this money on Carroll. Chelsea didn't give us 15m + Carroll. They gave us 50m with no interest in what we do with it. They just bought a player from a club for an amount that they valued him at. And then we went completely independently of them and spent 35m on Carroll.

&gt;Firstly, it is highly unlikely that Chelsea would have paid 50 million for Torres had we not been in the market for a replacement. If Chelsea had known that we did not NEED a replacement, or did not intend to buy a replacement, they would not have paid £50 million for Torres.

Again, how does that make sense? Chelsea didn't care what we did with the money they gave us. Why would they? This was not a three-way negotiation. There were two two-way negotiations. That we wouldn't have asked for 50m had Newcastle not requested 35m only goes to show that we weren't hard enough in the negotiations in the first place, then, as Chelsea apparently were willing to pay 50m all along. That we were able to get a replacement was why we sold. Chelsea not paying 50m if we didn't get a replacement makes no sense. Can you explain to me in detail how that logic would work? Why would Chelsea have any interest in whether Liverpool gets a replacement at all? They didn't go, ""Oh ok, we only planned to give you 25m, but since Newcastle is playing hardball with you guys and we can't leave you without a backup we'll double the amount!"" 

&gt;To be honest, I can't think of ANYBODY other than Carroll who fulfills these requirements. But let us say that I pulled these qualities out of my ass (which I did for the third one. Dalglish's need for young-ish homegrown players is evident to all). Let us consider who else Liverpool could have bought. I can't think of anyone. I am assuming that you are thinking of an already established world-class star.

I'm not thinking of a world class star. But I am thinking of several relatively good Premier League strikers who we could have acquired for a maximum of 10m at that point and who would have slotted into our system better than Carroll and wouldn't have been injured. They would have made an immediate impact - at least done better than score 1.5 goals in the remainder of the season. And then I assume we could have bought Carroll for 25m (or some other striker) in the summer and still had another backup striker, no? 

&gt;Can you please name another relatively young striker who is BETTER than Carroll and would realistically come to Liverpool for £35 million? You can name up to 3 if you like.

Being a ""better"" striker is of course subjective. Carroll is good for a system. That wasn't our system. We're now reworking the whole team and buying other expensive players ""just to provide ammunition for Carroll"", as I've seen it said. 

So let me instead ask you this: do you honestly believe that there is no other player in the whole world, let alone there being several, who could have slotted into our system better and would have been available for the same amount of money (35m transfer fee and 4m+ a year in wages?) Of all the hundreds of strikers playing top-level football around the world? Because in that case it seems that this discussion is really going nowhere.

1. Carroll's first game for Liverpool was on 6th March, coming on as a sub against Manchester United. That's about a month after he signed for Liverpool, which was the expected recovery time. The fact that they played him at all showed that the club believed he was close to full fitness. 

2. Dalglish might have been confident, but there was no way to be sure until the player started playing. There have been plenty of purchases by top managers that failed. Unless the player is superman, like Messi and Ronaldo, or exceptionally suited for your system, like Fabregas is supposed to be, most transfers are a gamble to some extent. 

3. This part I disagree. I believe that Liverpool looking for a replacement was part of the deal with Chelsea. You clearly disagree, so we can agree to disagree here. I think the negotiations were a lot more complicated than what you are saying, but you are entitled to your opinion. 

4. Please tell me who are these relatively good Premier League strikers who were available for 10m on the last day of the transfer season. Again, I truly believe that Dalglish was looking for someone young, and homegrown. Even if there was someone available (I'm not saying there isn't, I just can't think of any), I believe that they also wanted to make a ""statement of intent"", and this is something that I can neither support nor reject. 

5. Firstly, I find it hard to believe that Dalglish did not expect a change of the system at the time to fit Carroll in. I mean, it's fairly obvious that Carroll isn't suitable for a fluid pass-and-move ball-on-the-ground system, isn't it? Unless Comolli went behind Dalglish's back for this transfer, it means that Dalglish went it with full knowledge of what he was getting. 

It seems to me that Dalglish was planning for a team that can play 2 different systems, a pass-and-move style and one that provides ammunition for Carroll. Unless we can agree on this, we can't talk about other potential players. 

Personally, the only other player in the world who I think plays a similar style to Carroll is Mario Gomez, and there is no way in hell he would go to a team with no Champion's League.

I'm not saying that this *wasn't* the case. Nobody knows. What I'm saying is, had Newcastle asked 25m for Carroll, what you're saying is, we would have then asked for 40m for Torres from Chelsea? So you have absolutely no problem with that?

This doesn't quite sit well with the captured Silence saying we should kill them on sight... but maybe it is just that they know how humans would react to be constantly manipulated.  Notice that those who were running from the Silence were destructive and otherwise evil... so they could be an overall force for good.

I think that the guys in the ship we saw in the clip work for ole Eye Patch, and also are in a time traveling ship that could not only track but attack the TARDIS in flight.  They were able to project Amy no matter when or where they were in or out of the TARDIS so attacking the TARDIS in flight probably isn't that big of a deal.
Anyway, I think Mels is working for them in one way or another, helping to keep the Doctor from tracking down Melody or pick up on all the pieces that are getting moved around by The Silence, Patchy, etc.

When instructed not to worry by The Doctor, do not cease to worry about the following:

* Being left in a parallel universe with a Doctor that is The Doctor but isn't The Doctor.

* Turning yourself into a Time Lord and having your memory erased because all the knowledge wants to kill your mind

* Daleks. They'll still probably kidnap you.

* Cybermen killing your alternate universe mother (it's okay. Alternate universe dad can hook up with real mum. Real dad wont mind. He's dead.)

* Being stolen and replaced by flesh

* Having your newborn baby stolen and replaced by flesh.

* Finding out that your daughter is The Doctor's woman.

* Your boyfriend being turned into plastic and waiting two thousand years for you.

* Your boyfriend being turned into plastic without you realising, and then killing you against his will.

Basically, The Doctor is confident in the fact that he will save the day no matter what. Just be aware that collateral damage happens, and you could be that collateral damage.

Actually, kinda increases the numbers shown as unemployed, because sickness benefit pays more than unemployment benefit or job-seekers allowance, and the Department of Social Security periodically throw the genuinely ill off sickness benefit claiming that they're faking it.

If you've had your leg amputated then you won't have this problem, but if you've got any illness which is ""invisible"" then you'll experience this - I think I've read of people with bad backs or digestive problems getting slung off the sick, but they like to do it to the mentally ill, too.

A few years ago I was on the sick for depression and had an assessment meeting to determine my illness. The DSS subcontracts this out to a private company, so one would assume they show better performance if they deny you sickness benefit. One of the questions they asked was ""do you have any problems washing up?"" and I kinda gave a laugh, replying, ""actually I did that this morning"". It was probably naive of me not to explain fully at the time - I laughed because that morning had been the first time in a week I had done my washing up, and also because I have hoarding tendencies and because my inability to cope with everyday tasks was manifesting itself in other ways (e.g. the hoovering, other clutter). 

Now in my case, it didn't really matter that I got kicked off sickness benefit, because I was already on a New Deal retraining type of programme and I shortly later set myself up as self-employed doing something at which I was reasonably happy and successful. But at the time I recounted this to my friend, and his reply was ""the washing up? yeah, &lt;laughs&gt; they asked me that, too"". My friend is a schizophrenic and has paranoid episodes - after they slashed his benefit he had to live on a pittance, and one might imagine that it was the increased stress of this that saw him jumping out of a moving car, running across two lanes of motorway and hiding up to his neck in a lake for several hours. Clearly ""they were out to get him"", but it took several hours for the cops to find him and get him to hospital.

With depression, doctors will sign you on the sick because it's easy and because it doesn't cost them anything to do so - relaxing and chilling out and having your rent paid by the state is probably amongst the most cost-effective treatments. However, the NHS doesn't have much else in the way of resources, so you've got naff all change of seeing a shrink, if you want one. You do get counselling, a standard 6 sessions, and generally no more, if you want, but it's at a fairly basic level. So at a certain point the NHS's lack of resources extends the cost to the DSS, and the DSS's response undoes the what little good work the NHS was able to provide. Likewise the situation with my mate, who clearly has problems functioning in any normal way (with the benefit of hindsight I can see that workplace disagreements he recounted to be when in employment before his diagnosis must have been exacerbated by his paranoid tendencies). 

The DSS's *own tribunals* judge that of those kicked off sickness benefit and having to claim a job-seeking type of allowance instead, [c 60% had an incorrect initial assessment](http://fullfact.org/blog/incapacity_benefits_welfare_ESA_fit_for_work_DWP-2853). 
So the genuinely ill have to struggle for months, in this time, waiting for the DSS to correct the mistakes of their own over-zealous officialdom. Wouldn't it just be better to give the sick *help* in the first place, and try to get them sorted out and maybe working again?

Absolutely. Making that transition can be extremely difficult for some, and the state of the global economy right now doesn't help anyone. I don't pretend that isn't the case for one moment.

I *do* feel this discussion does need some perspective though. At the end of the day, we're talking about homeownership. It just so happens that the UK has one of the highest homeownership rates in the world (~70%), and that feeds into this sense of entitlement Silversuns exhibits.

&gt; Yes, apparently in mossadinfiltrator's fucked up world, people who get degrees should blame no one but themselves for their silly choices! Fucking derp.

I've got some great snake oil to sell you. Will only set you back £20k, and it may (or may not) increase your employment prospects in the future.

I'll sell it to you as long as you don't come back to me in a few years time bitching as much about how you were misadvised on the purchase and how little it has helped your employment prospects, just like you did about your degree.

Did someone force you to take on the degree? Did someone hold a gun to your head while you filled out your UCAS application? Did someone enter into a contractual agreement with you promising the degree would increase your employment prospects? 

If the answer to all three questions is no, then you honestly do have no one but yourself to blame. You can shove the ""it's everyone's fault but my own"" attitude along with the sense of entitlement.

For example, had you taken what you have done and pushed it all closer together, maybe with a bit more overlapping, it would give off a very chaotic feel, which would relate to the confusion of the sixth season. The dripping lines are what made me think of that, I think it's a nice touch.

I hadn't thought of it before, but after reading through a few of the other comments, if the screwdriver wasn't there the painting would look empty. But that's not a bad thing, it would add a sort of mystery to it, considering all the white space.  Regardless, it is maybe *too* organized, with everything being all around the same size. 

Composition, and a focus point are really important to consider. Obviously I don't know how much planning you put into this piece, but doing a few quick sketches before hand of different compositions is always a good thing. 

And, last but not least (god I'm so sorry for making you read all of this, I hope it makes sense and you're not like ""fuck this chick, who does she think she is!?"") consider emotion. What do you want the viewers to feel when they look at your piece? Really think about what's going on in your artwork, and what you want to convey. Like I mentioned before: chaos or mystery maybe.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt; That does have a lot to do with things today, as my generation really aren't that interested in austerity and delayed gratification, we want everything and we want it now, so the idea of living in a shit hole and eating welfare beans for half a decade is alien to us.

The movement towards instant gratification we've seen in recent decades isn't *necessarily* a bad thing. I'm sure most people would prefer living in an average home for twenty years as opposed to a shit hole for half that time, and a luxury penthouse the other half (consumption smoothing et al.)

I suppose what we're seeing now is the removal of credit lines and imposition of harsher liquidity constraints removing peoples' choice in the matter. You can no longer live in the average home for twenty years; you don't have a choice but to take the shit hole for ten years.

I can see why that is frustrating, and why so many people are angry about it. I don't tend to see it as a great injustice, though. People have, as you point out, endured worse in the past. 

&gt; As for home ownership in the UK, it was a product of ideas Thatcher and Reagan produced, which was that places where people owned their houses generally were cleaner, had less of a crime problem and were safer. So, they decided that this was because owners have a stake in their community while renters couldn't really care. And so the idea was born to make as many people own houses as possible, so this uplifting effect would spread across the land and resolve some of the crippling social issues both nations faced in the late 70's/early 80's.

It's a very interesting subject; I'll have to do some reading up on it.

I think this notion of people not having a stake in society is particularly salient at the moment, and was certainly a factor in the recent riots in London and elsewhere. It'll be interesting to see what happens as homeownership decreases even further, as will no doubt happen...",0,1313634132,null,0,false,0,c2d9x78,t3_jm33s,t1_c2d9x78,t1_c2d9n38,1427485711,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

Kalou is trickier, longer contract I think and he's a decent sub, good team player. We have a lack of wide players at the moment, we shouldn't be giving him up just yet. Maybe if Mata and de Bruyne both come in (can Mata play on the left?). I do like Malouda because of his defensive prowess though, I think it adds a lot to the side that's underrated right now.

Meireles is cheap, if that ends up being the price he goes for. Parker would be cheaper though, I wonder if that's a better option? He's English so won't have a need to sell. An older player would also impede the development of our younger midfielders less, too.

He says:     
*""Any participation …  in the criminal activities of
that night … irrespective of its precise form, derives its gravity because it was carried on by one of those who by sheer weight of numbers subjected the commercial areas to a sustained onslaught  … Anyone on the streets that night who took part in crime added to the effects of the overall criminality… ""*
 
However, that doesn't, for example, state that the severity of the individual crimes shouldn't be considered in the greater part of the whole. I'll come back to this in a moment.

Basically, I read a lot of this as hot air and puffing himself up - he says a lot of ""I've considered"" and ""taken in the context of"" and ""I have referred to"" and ""citizens of this good town (heartbreaking for them, protecting them)"" - but that's all very vague and non-quantative stuff. It seems like he's either justifying his stance to himself or, more likely, justifying it so that the record states he considered all this stuff when the sentences are up for appeal.

So back to considering the severity of the individual crimes - if this guy sentenced someone with no previous to 6 months for stealing a bottle of water then I don't see this justification he's written as vindicating that.

**However, this judge has *NOT* sentenced someone with no previous to 6 months for £3.50 of bottled water.**

**All of the convicted listed in this document have previous records**, and that makes it very difficult for me to know whether or not these sentences are relatively harsh. The kid with a ""very considerable"" previous record gets 2 years for apparent active participation. I don't know much about this, but that seems like a pretty fair cop to me. The guy with the least previous had a £500 telly in the back of his car, and he had driven into town to spend 5 hours amidst the looting - there is clear evidence of aforethought there, and I don't equate his sentence to someone who may have just been passing and ""given into temptation"". This judge recognises that Boyd has succeeded in getting off heroin in the last year and is trying to turn her life around (I can only wonder if he'd have been so lenient to a male junkie).

I find some of this judge's justifications a bit disingenuous and self-serving, really. An 18 year old who lost his parents at the cusp of his teenage years and who has probably been in and out of institutions since (""very considerable"" criminal record) has ""had every chance since then to put [his] life straight"". I don't really buy that, and I wonder how much experience the judge can have behind bars himself, to be dishing out sentences so casually. He states that ""as a matter of law, a prisoner is entitled to be released after serving half his sentence"" and goes on to imply that the press are disingenuous in their reporting, but surely you could easily get beaten up in the prison yard and lose that right to early remission. It seems bogus of the judge to suggest that all prisoners will get out automatically having served only half their time - that is a reward for good behaviour and not a certainly. 

Having been all negative nancy on him, **I'm not saying this judge's sentencing is unfair**, I just don't know that this document is such a great ""insight"" into the rationale of the sentencing. The sentences don't match up with the most draconian ones reported in the press, IMO, the document contains a lot of wishy-washing blathering, and it's only one court and a handful of cases. I do feel it's a bit of an insight, to me, into the court system, but only one aspect of it - this judge and these cases as a counterpoint to all the other cases we've seen reported in the press (and more deeply than those, perhaps).",0,1313648087,null,0,true,0,c2dbgk4,t3_jm9af,t1_c2dbgk4,t3_jm9af,1427486438,4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,4

Also, Jackie Tyler was always good for a laugh. Being an American, I still laugh like a moron watching ""Love and Monsters"" when she first meets Elton and remarks ""I've just met you, and here I am, flashing you me knickers!"". It's so British-slang, it's delicious.

As far as characters I didn't like, Martha's mother was always a thorn in my ass. Whenever she kept calling, I just wanted to fast forward, especially when she was crying in ""42"" and her mother was like ""WE NEED TO TALK ABOUT EVIL DOCTOR MAN &gt;:("". What an inconsiderate douche. I was hoping a Dalek would pop up and cap her, but no, she had to be alive at the end.

Although, if I'm going to make mention of my least favorite non-main role (Main role goes to Donna. I love Rose, I warmed to Martha eventually. Donna still makes me go ""THIS IS THE LAST TENNANT SEASON STOP RUINING IT""), it comes from my actual favorite Doctor Who story of all time; ""The Family of Blood"" arc, with Baines being my least favorite.

No, I don't think those two guys deserve the sentence they got, prison is more than likely going to make them worse and two years down the line they'll probably reoffend, committing a crime they may not have done if they hadn't gone to jail. 

Nor do I think the guy who got banned from facebook deserves his sentence, because (from the fairly sparse details available) it looks like he was actually just joking. That's why I said:

&gt;If, **in a separate case**, someone did something like this over facebook **seriously, and with real intent**, I would support this punishment.

For the hypothetical scenario of a first offender genuinely trying to incite others to riot via facebook, I think a 1 year ban from facebook and a community sentence, with enforced participation in some kind of social responsibility class, is proportionate and useful to the offender and the rest of the community.

EDIT: Also, you want to know why the sentences seem disproportionate? Judges have been instructed to disregard standard sentencing guidelines! The public reason for this is that a crime committed during a riot is made more serious by the scenario. The real reason, IMO, is pandering to public anger (which is not what the justice system is there for), and making an example of the people involved.",0,1313653845,null,0,true,0,c2dbw28,t3_jlsoy,t1_c2dbw28,t1_c2d8y6g,1427486635,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

true,[deleted],null,null,"It's more complicated than that though, since this problem existed itself because of the concentration of wealth and the need for consumption to keep the economy running (not a bad thing, more consumption is good as it means we have more food and consumer goods, etc.). The concentration of wealth meant that the masses could no longer stimulate the economy, and so easy credit was created to ensure this could continue by putting the money back in to common circulation.

Tied in to this is the effect of the fractional reserve banking system which creates money through loans (as only a fraction of the loan has to be backed up initially), and then more loans are created from these loans, so an initial principle of say, 1000 GBP can create 1952 GBP in circulation after just three loans (assuming a 20% required reserve, which is high). This means that we need loans to expand the money supply, the justification behind this is that the loans then provide money for the growth of the economy, which then prevents inflation, of course, if the growth falters then we face inflation, interest rates will rise and people will stop taking out loans and the money supply will contract, resulting in a deflationary cycle and recession.

So to avoid recession we must constantly create new loans to stimulate consumer demand (because of the wealth concentration and monetary system). Incidentally it is this point which links to your own, as it means we need constant growth, as otherwise there is simply never enough money in circulation to pay off all the existing loans, and this is unsustainable, for even though technological progress may help us, ultimately we can never keep up with the ever increasing pace demanded.

But my point is that the problems are much more economic than simply based on population.

also, because i think it's important - I'd encourage each of you to seriously consider whether going to uni is going to be worth it in the long run.

Unless you are going to get a 2:1 or a 1st in most subjects it's not really going to improve your job chances all that much, while it is going to leave you with debts in most cases. Whereas someone with 3-4 years work experience will be much more attractive to employers. There have been multiple discussions here about this every time uni fees and so on are discussed, and I'm far from alone in this opinion, but of course it's up to you what you do.

whatever you do, have fun and enjoy it!

He's just trying to pressurise Levy into offloading the fringe players quickly so we have some cash to bring in reinforcements now, rather than holding out for the most money we can get by selling on the 31st and leaving us with no chance to actually use the money.

And to be fair he's right - I don't want to see Modric leave but I'd be plenty confident in our chances if we went into this season with a central mid pair of Sandro and Huddlestone backed by Palacios and, say, Parker or Diarra, and a better set of options upfront. And by the looks of the way Levy's playing things currently that's the only way we do go into the season with a significantly improved set of forward options. We'd even have the cash to bring in a player like Pjanic who looks available too.

The season we finished 4th our centre mid pair for all but the last half dozen games was Huddlestone and Palacios. Modric was less effective then when playing the leftside than Bale is in that position now, Lennon's a better player on the right now, and our forward options then didn't include VdV or the top-class forward(s?) we'd be bringing in if Modric does go - not to mention Sandro kicks Palacios' arse.

It sucks because you can't compete for air balls in the box anymore - either the goalkeeper comes out, and if he gets touched it is a foul, or the defender stays down knowing that any touch on him will also result in a foul. Defenders and goalkeepers are both over-protected, it never used to be like that, and they should change it back to how it was so that we can see more physical competition and more goals.

This all started when a few goalkeepers were injured after going up for balls. Back in the mid to late 90s, so they didn't make a formal rule change, they just started enforcing it different.

Same with the penalty - the referee should *never* have any form of discretion when it comes to sending the player off. There *is no* room for discretion in the rules - it is plain and simple, if you foul as the last defender you are sent off. If defenders know that there is a 30, 40 or 50% chance that they will not get sent off, naturally they will take their chances with the penalty rather than what would be a goal 90% of the time in a 1-on-1.

I really despise Real Madrid. I don't like the history of the club, I don't like their politics, I don't like their arrogance and I don't like their style of football and behavior - and this morning was a prime example of that.

So I support Barça in that I want Real Madrid to lose.

In other leagues, there is a decent link between Juve and Liverpool. Similar clubs (historic, most titles, Turin and Liverpool being similar, then the disaster we share).

Our link with Barcelona is because so many of our coaches are from Catalonia and were previously with Barça - and we appropriated a lot from La Masia and their youth system when Rafa came in (although Rafa was ex-Real Madrid, he apparently established an excellent relationship with Barcelona)

The link with Celtic is ethnic based because of the number of Scotts we have. Although I can never remember the religious divide between LFC and Everton and which way that goes - I know it did exist 20-30 years ago but doesn't any more.

&gt;you’ll need to have an excellent academic background, preferably in Computer Science, with at least a 2.1 or a 1st from a good university.

That's just  the companies that request it in the notice.  If there's an online application--and many places use those now instead of or in addition to CVs--there will almost without fail be a section for reporting not only your overall degree classification, but also frequently for your marks for individual papers/modules/dissertations/exams.  You may also be asked point-blank at an interview.  

Again, not everywhere, not all the time, but it's an oft-repeated and unhelpful fallacy that no one cares what degree classification you get.

&gt;A recent spot check by Jon Bramley our County Mammal Recorder at one site on the Medway in west Kent found an otter holt and a good pile of spraint nearby (Photo can be seen in the gallery).

true,Squarehed,eng-cumberland,Cumbrian in London,"I don't think this article's author is too well informed. While it is not clear from the article itself, I suspect that she is conflating the pensions provided to public sector workers with the basic state pension, provided to everyone. Changes to the latter in contributions and pension age are what have met with the most opposition, with public sector unions going on strike at the end of June. To state that 'opposition from unions and charities [...] makes the government’s success uncertain, and prevents it from taking the bolder steps needed' might contain a grain of truth, but pensions for public sector workers are like other pensions provided by employers and it is my understanding that they were thought to be sustainable, not requiring great inter-generational transfers or increased government assistance. This was prior to the controversial changes designed to reduce the government's contribution as employer.
On the other hand, the universal, unfunded, 'pay-as-you-go' Basic State Pension age is being increased at a faster rate than planned, to 66 for both men and women by 2020. Resistance to this has been minimal as far as I am aware. Changes to that age, undoubtedly needed before the next scheduled increase to 67 after 2034, will most likely be successful.

I disagree with her on university degrees. She suggests that it is 'manifestly unfair' for people to subsidise university degrees that they do not benefit from.
First of all, there are many benefits from university degrees and universities' activities that go to all in society besides those that go to the individual. 
Further, there are numerous cases where I'd argue that it is manifestly unfair NOT to subsidise something that one receives no benefit from. For example, it is a fair characterisation that a working person will receive no benefit from subsidising somebody's unemployment insurance, but to allow someone to be destitute and starving as a result of involuntary job loss is very unfair, especially in such a prosperous society. So she's surely wrong if she thinks that all cases of subsidy without benefit are unfair.
She needs some other leg to stand on when claiming that it's not fair for university degrees to be subsidised.

The author has a quite selfish and individualistic political mindset and the article belies an instrumental and commercial attitude to education. She covets house and property ownership just like the baby boomers. The British addiction to house ownership and price increases fuelled by cheap credit has to come to an end. She's part of the problem.

To ignore the biggest inter-generational issue that the country and world face is a huge oversight. Climate change and the depletion of natural resources get no mention. The insatiable consumption and denial of the consequences from babyboomers drunk on oil is leaving my generation with a tab that dwarfs the student, mortgage and national debts that the author worries about here.",0,1313664679,null,0,false,0,c2dcgsf,t3_jm33s,t1_c2dcgsf,t3_jm33s,1427486907,5,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,5

But that shouldn't blind people to the fact that this is bullshit. A levels must have gotten easier over time, rather than harder as you would expect after 29 years if record results.

It means f**k all if everybody has got A's. IMO the overall results of A levels shouldn't change that much at all. They should be dynamic and alter each year to match the quality of the students and previous year scores so that the results are still meaningful.

You had to buy your own supplies , and there wasn't allot of teacher support. People would hand out fliers and invite you to gigs and the people were really fun and down to earth. People at the college really took their studies seriously and there was never much talking in the class. Theres a river running through the campus and its really gorgeous and its close to the shopping mall and city library. you should pack your own lunches because food from the shops and vending machine is expensive.
Its right in the city centre , so you can see loads of great architecture , its really pretty!
they have been doing allot of renovation so I'm not sure how it looks now , but the art department was kinda shabby though

This of course all leads to students who are really really good at passing exams, but not necessarily better at applying that knowledge, which is bad for everyone.

true,[deleted],null,null,"That's the problem, it would take years.  You can't implement it in this tax year because businesses wouldn't know what their tax burden would be, certainly if they're going to have large negative externalities recognised and if hypothetically their burden might even go up, and they certainly can't begin to spend a tax break until they know what it is.  Then they have to be graded, and we're very much used to grading business rates, but they have to have time to accommodate these changes, so there goes the next tax year.  Then the policy itself has to be drawn, voted on, all after going to committee.  You're really talking a government with a strong mandate and a full term of office  ahead of it.  So no small or short term task.

What you could do is begin making similar changes to VAT and duty, making essentials more affordable and luxuries/immoral/more resource-heavy products more expensive indirectly placing emphasis on local products.  You could actually make cheaper products from countries with less regulations more expensive than originally slightly more expensive, better built local products made under stricter regulation. Currently we expect to pay more for products which are organic, British and fair trade.  They'll still have their immediate overheads until a Pigovian business rate/corporation tax can be introduced but they'll be more competitive if you place extra duty/tax on products that come from a sweat shop.  You could then use that to grease the wheels in evaluating business externalities, using it as a template, speeding up the process.

We already do this in part with VAT.  Children's clothing and various sanitation products are tax exempt.  Why not have a more tiered system which includes how the product was made, the welfare of the worker that produced it and the cost to the environment, because a local company is invariably always going to fair better and there's still nothing from exporting their produce, it just makes more sense for them to produce it in Britain.

The advantages are much more subtle, first you have the psychological impact on the victim, meaning they're less likely to attack you and or calm down if you draw a big stick and threaten to bonk them, and the second is the psychological impact on the officer, or more specifically that there is a mental connection between action and pain to the victim.

&gt;&gt;I know I’ve been very silent online today and the reason is above. In an hour BBC1 will show the second episode of “End of Time”, and with that, the very last episode with David Tennant’s as THE DOCTOR.
Because of that I wanted to make a better painting of his PORTRAYAL OF THE DOCTOR than the one above in the header, so late last night I did the sketch and the basic shadings for this…and the rest I’ve painted during the afternoon today…up until now actually :p
And yes, I’ve saved progress images that I will post a bit later tonight :)
David Tennant has been THE GOD DAMN DOCTOR for so long that it will be very weird to see Matt Smith doing this character, but then again, he might take us all by surprise :)
What I liked about Tennant’s DOCTOR is the fast changes in his mood, the crazy smile and the stare that only David Tennant can do. While Christopher Eccleston’s INCARNATION OF THE DOCTOR was a bit dark, the 10th Doctor [Holy tap dancing christ you got it right this time]has been a lot of fun :D
In any case, there’s a bigger version if you click the image above and as I said, I will be back later with the progress of this painting :)

Only thing is I was supposed to get ABB to get on, but I only got ABC.

(also my head of sixth form was filming it and my reaction will be hilarious seeing be buzzing to find out how much I got in by, only to see I actually got a grade lower than what I needed.) 

It seemed to take hours and hours to get through to UCAS to confirm I had in fact got in, and I did, so FUCK YEAH!!!! Also I got ABC but for each subject I was only 4-6 marks off the grade above! But I don't really care, A level results don't matter much anyway once you're in uni.

I feel very very very lucky though, almost like I have cheated my way in, I know others who were one grade off and didn't get in. I can't imagine how depressed I'd be right now if I didn't get in.

I'm also really pleased to see how Dzeko is progressing. I'm hoping in Aguero he's found the partnership he missed out on last season. Him and Grafite were storming at Wolfsburg.

It's not something I've done a great deal of research on, but I remain sceptical. It strikes me as a societal norm that has, in the post-war era at least, coincided with tangible economic benefits.

However, property remains a good investment almost exclusively because there is a chronic shortage of it. An awful lot of people are pinning their hopes on this continuing to be the case for the foreseeable future, and as the author of this article highlights, the baby boomers are wielding their significant political clout to make sure it is.

That said, it is by no means the *best* investment out there. If you were making the decision five years ago whether to take on a mortgage, for example, you would have done *far* better to invest your deposit in gold (231% 5-year growth relative to GBP) or even stocks in Apple (441.36% growth relative to USD)

Back in 2006 the average proposed mortgage deposit in the UK was £30,742. If you'd taken that amount and invested it in Apple stock, you'd have made a tidy ~£104,830 profit. For the sake of comparison, the average property price has fallen ~10% over the same period.

What we need is, undisputedly, a massive increase in the construction of new, affordable homes. That should not only put a halt to ever-increasing property prices, but also begin to eat away at the perception that a mortgage is a necessary rite of passage.

true,chrisjd,eng-Oxfordshire,Oxfordshire,"&gt;That said, it is by no means the best investment out there. If you were making the decision five years ago whether to take on a mortgage, for example, you would have done far better to invest your deposit in gold (231% 5-year growth relative to GBP) or even stocks in Apple (441.36% growth relative to USD)

&gt;Back in 2006 the average proposed mortgage deposit in the UK was £30,742. If you'd taken that amount and invested it in Apple stock, you'd have made a tidy ~£104,830 profit. For the sake of comparison, the average property price has fallen ~10% over the same period.

It depends which year you compare from. House prices have come down from their peak in the 2000's, but if you bought a house in 1996 it would still be worth over double what you payed for it now. Apples stocks have gone up partly because of the success of the I-Phone, and gold has gone up because it always does when the markets are uncertain. If you had forseen these things then yes you could have made more money than buying a house.

I don't think the main reason to buy a property should be as an investment though. Personally the main reason my girlfriend and I bought a flat was because we were tired of the uncertainty of having everything decided by a landlord. We had one landlord who refused to fix anything when it broke and another who had to kick us out as he was selling the property and we'd had enough.

&gt;What we need is, undisputedly, a massive increase in the construction of new, affordable homes. That should not only put a halt to ever-increasing property prices, but also begin to eat away at the perception that a mortgage is a necessary rite of passage.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt; I don't think the main reason to buy a property should be as an investment though. Personally the main reason my girlfriend and I bought a flat was because we were tired of the uncertainty of having everything decided by a landlord. We had one landlord who refused to fix anything when it broke and another who had to kick us out as he was selling the property and we'd had enough.

I'd analogise the purchase of real estate to that of cars, if it were the case that the manufacture of cars fell well short of demand year on year. In a perfect market, property might actually be a *depreciating* asset; homes should lose value as they become dated, require increasing maintenance, and lack features that become commonplace in contemporary homes, etc.

As with the market for cars, there are upsides and downsides to leasing and buying. You mention having a landlord who refuses to fix anything as a downside, but many would consider having responsibility for repairs and maintenance of a property assumed by a landlord to be a benefit of renting, equivalent to having a warranty on a lease car.

Likewise, although you may dislike uncertainty and have a desire to settle down in one place, many renters consider the ability to move from one property to another without all the hassle of buying and selling property to be a benefit. Many people like the ability to have the latest and greatest cars, and to swap cars easily as their needs change, equivalent to moving from one property to another when changing jobs, for example. Taking out a mortgage and buying a house ties you down.

If we removed the constraints on the construction of new, affordable housing — as is the central proposal of the article in question — we wouldn't have this absurd situation in which assets that ought to be depreciating are actually appreciating at a ridiculous rate, which is contributing to the notion that homeownership is an essential component of life.",0,1313700249,null,0,false,0,c2dgxua,t3_jm33s,t1_c2dgxua,t1_c2dgqxk,1427489082,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

true,Ivashkin,null,null,"&gt; I disagree. Most universities have ample computing facilities. New laptops cost around £300 and come with one year warranties. Most manufacturer's warranties are around £80-120. If a laptop is going to break down within 5 years, it'll break down in the first year. It's just not worth it.

Having looked over the stats for the near 2000 laptops  that have come through my office in the last 3 years, I would disagree. While it is true that manufacturing defects will show in the first year (usually the first 2-3 months tbh), wear and tear is a significant factor, and this is especially true in for a student. As is accidental damage. However, not all warranties are equal, and that is why I would always recommend a Dell with the NBD on-site support, it's the only warranty which is worth a damn. 

I would also recommend that a student purchase a laptop with a plan for a 3-4 year life cycle, as most students will have more money at the beginning of their degree course than they will in year 3 or after they graduate. So if you pay for the 3 year NBD, it will ensure that your laptop is covered for your entire course, and that you won't have it die on you mid way through your final year, a point where your finances are likely to be piss poor.",0,1313704996,null,0,false,0,c2dhods,t3_jmm53,t1_c2dhods,t1_c2df39x,1427489429,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

true,Odd-One-Out,eng-northhamptonshire,Northamptonshire,"* Good places to eat are particularly at the Guild of Students and the University Centre. There's a Subway at the Guild if that's your thing, though rush hour is usually 12pm-2pm and the queues get crazy long. Joe's is a bar/pizza restaurant in the Guild and there's some good food and seating there to meet up with mates for a meal. As for University Centre, there's four cafes (Cafe Go, Cafe Spice, Avanti, Ginster's), a farm food shop (like freshly made pasties, rolls, random farm grown veg, jams, cakes, pies, etc) and a Spar convenience shop. There's also a Spar at the Guild too so if you're feeling lazy or in a rush to get to a lecture but want food, you don't have to run across campus to get food. Every day from morning 'til late there's a market stall which sells a wide variety of fruit and veg for your convenience. Saves on those unnecessary trips to Tesco just because you need two tomatoes to complete that stew you've got brewin'.

* Best way is by bike if you're living at the top of the Vale (Elgar, Aitken, Maple Bank) or by foot (Shackleton, Mason). I used to live in Mason and it took about 10-15 minutes to walk to the centre of campus. A shuttle bus service called 'University A' runs every 20 minutes between all halls at the Vale and at various places around campus which will cost you 50p per ride. There is a shortcut if you're walking and that will be made known to you afgter you've walked to campus a few times. You'll notice people walking through the shortcut.

* Internet in halls is excellent. You need to bring (or buy for a couple of quid when you arrive on move-in day) an Ethernet cable to connect your device to the Ethernet port on the wall. You can connect one device by standard or pay an extra £10 per additional device that you want to be able to access Internet. For example, last year I had a laptop and a MacBook. I setup the MacBook to connect to the Ethernet port in my room as standard and paid an additional £10 to be able to remove the cable from the MacBook and then connect my laptop to that same port. You can't get away with putting the cable in without paying that extra fee, the Internet just won't work. Standard is 8MB I think... you can upgrade for a fee to faster connection speeds such as 25MB and even 50MB if you want to torrent loads. Often I hear that Uni internet blocks torrenting but I was able to torrent at halls. Weird, but useful. You are not allowed to set up a wireless router. Oh, for gaming online you will need to register your PS3 or whatever for £10 fee as mentioned above.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt; There is when it means so many of the population are supposed to live in such a small area that housing is in short supply so the prices go up.

You're highlighting a different problem, in which the density of jobs in an area has far outstripped the density of residential property, such that the cost of living in that area is prohibitively expensive even for those with jobs there.

Such a disparity can happen anywhere, not just in areas such as London where there happens to be a high density of jobs. The equal and opposite case is one in which a large amount of residential property has been created in an area where there are no jobs.

Only if there were a perfectly even geographic distribution of residential property could you even begin to make a case for a correspondingly even distribution of jobs.

The problem with regards to London is not so much that it is a small area, but that planning regulations and assorted red tape prevent residential property developers from making the most efficient use of land in the city. 

Whereas planning authorities are pleased to see old office blocks torn down and replaced with new skyscrapers — new buildings! more jobs! everyone's happy... right? — the same isn't true of residential developments. With access to sufficient financing, developers would be queueing up to tear down blocks of low-rise residential buildings and replace them with skyscrapers. There is enormous demand.

In *very* few cases is that likely to be true. This is more to do with people wanting choice and protection from prosecution, not being made to endure additional suffering).

The law does need to be reviewed and reformed to support assisted dying in some cases, and this test case will help do that. Personally I think Terry Pratchett's suggestion - that coroner's courts should hear, approve and oversee individual applications for assisted dying - is the way to go, but what we have to do is stop polarizing the argument as if it's cruel and stupid for the law to try and protect people.

true,Prophet92,tennant,Tennant,"Favorite:Wilfred-He's just a funny old man who wants to have one last adventure and who wants the best for his granddaughter. He's a really nice, supportive character who's always able to see hope when nobody else can. Also, his interaction with the Doc is hilarious and, in End of Time, genuinely touching. He's got no idea of his limitations or those of the people around him, and I think it's just a blast to have him around. It was nice to let him have his day in the sun in the end.

Other favorite(only shows up once, so I gave it to a recurring):Sally Sparrow-I love this character. Absolutely love her. She's clever, she's independent, she doesn't let the remarkable, impossible things happening around her get to her,and her determination to figure everything out is absolutely endearing. She's also funny as hell and loyal to the people around her,and I love how she refused to take shit from a RECORDING of the Doctor.That says a lot, even in her darkest moment she has her pride and she refuses to let someone talk down to her, especially because of everything she's given up to get so far(I didn't explain this well, I just basically like that she doesn't let the doctor treat her like an idiot in a moment where a lot of people would just hang on his every word no matter how much he patronized them). If I could pick the next companion I would have her join the Doctor in a heartbeat.

Least Favorite:Jackie Tyler-She does nothing but whine, she's selfish, she's a coward, and she's the SHRILLEST woman I've ever heard. She's also never funny as comic relief, and every episode with her in it is just brought down by her stupid antics.

true,silencia,null,null,"I am still questioning because I'm neither dismissing the claims nor accepting them. 

That the human species is having a quantifiable effect on the amount of CO^2 (along with other 'greenhouse' gasses) is known and provable; we are modifying the proportions of these, no-one I know of questions that.

That the makeup of an atmosphere affects it's thermal signature (ceterus parebus) is also known.

On the face of it it would seem incontravertable that the human species is having an effect.

However the big loophole in the above is ceterus parebus, all other things being equal, all other things are *not* equal. This is a dynamic system with *some* counterbalancing modifiers: increased warmth in the atmosphere leads to increased moisture which increases cloud cover raising the Earth's aldebo, reflecting more heat back out; global dimming due to increased air traffic cools; plants thrive in a higher carbon atmosphere raising the conversion rates of CO^2 to O^2 and so on.

However all of the above are reactions to the changes we are effecting. At the margin our activity is enough to trigger these reactions; a demonstrable effect of our activity - in pointed contrast to your claim that we are having 'not one iota' of effect.

These contervaling and balancing systems are large but finite. Other aspects of our behaviour is effecting that (e.g. reducing the rainforests) or it may be that the limits may be being reached (e.g. the ability of the 'carbon sink' in the micro-fauna and micro-flora of the oceans to bury excess carbon may have been reached, ditto the permafrost in Northern latitudes). 

We don't know what the overall effects may be which is why I don't dismiss climate change counter arguments out of hand; however only those that have an agenda claim that we are having no effect.

But that is the thing - *we don't know*

As for the downvoting.   Even if you are correct (which you may or may not be) the tenor of your 'addition' was little more than standing on the sidelines booing 'you're wrong', i.e. no actual contribution at all - as I said, *that* is why I downvoted you - you didn't add to the discussion, you made an unsupported statement then refused to explicate because we'd already made up our minds that you were wrong (to paraphrase you).

If the law is to be changed there will obviously need to be a system in place to ensure that those choosing to die are doing it with a clear mind and not because they feel forced or obligated into doing it.  What worries me - from both sides of the argument - is that such a system may seek to overlay black/white decisions on something that is a whole lot of grey.  Will someone who is suffering from a degenerative mental problem have the same rights as someone who is suffering from something like the gentleman in the article for instance.  There is also the problem of how to cope with situations - like Pratchett's - where the patient wishes to die at some future point when their condition becomes to much for them, but at that point they may no longer be able to make reasoned decisions.

It's not something that's easy to talk about, even with family.  I'm sure we've all had the 'If I ever......then put a pillow over my face' conversation with loved ones when seeing someone with parkinsons/quadriplegia etc. but to actually sit down with someone you love and say you want to die is a lot harder. 

I'm not 100% familiar with Terry Pratchett's suggestions so forgive me if  I'm plagerising him.  My own suggestion would be that each applicant puts his situation to a panel of health care professionals chosen at random and made up not just of doctors, but also of nurses who often  have more first hand knowledge of suffering than doctors.

Actually, I correct myself. Here's what Wiki says:

British newspapers The Daily Telegraph and The Daily Mail identified the character as the Doctor's mother as early as April 2009. Russell T. Davies wrote in an email to the author of The Writers Tale, ""I like leaving it open, because then you can imagine what you want. I think the fans will say it's Romana. Or even the Rani. Some might say that it's Susan's mother, I suppose. But of course it's meant to be the Doctor's mother.""

As with anything, there are issues. Coroners may have their own moral objections. They may be put in the unenviable position of having to deny an application because they do not feel that the facts warrant assisted dying - and who wants to be put in the position of telling someone they have to continue in a situation they find intolerable?

I don't think anyone is doing that, I certainly didn't intend to. Personally I don't say anything like ""Don't be silly, that's not going to happen."" - all I did mention was that as far as I know the statistics in Switzerland hasn't shown a marked increase in voluntary suicides amongst vulnerable groups.

I'd be interested to know how many elderly etc *already* feel pressured into ending their lives. Thinking about it now I would hazard a guess that more people end their lives now already than would go on to do so if the process was assisted. That isn't an argument *for* AS, but it's another tied along issue.


&gt; inhumane and barbaric? In *very* few cases is that likely to be true.

So you agree that there are some cases where it is inhumane and barbaric? If there is *one* then it's too many. That was my point.

&gt; The law does need to be reviewed and reformed to support assisted dying in some cases, and this test case will help do that.

Agree with that and the rest about Terry Pratchett.

They started at over £1200 and dropped to c £300 or £400.

I've tried checking online, and I've never been offered a quote that compared favourably with phoning insurance brokers. I'm not sure if I'm currently with Bell or Adrian Flux, but they're the companies I've used in the past few years - I only found Adrian Flux because they gave a discount to people who mentioned a certain Mondeo website.

To give an illustration of how disproportionately insurance prices vary, this thread shows a guy that got [insurance quotes between £14,000 - £28,000 from searching websites](http://www.tt-forum.co.uk/forum/viewtopic.php?f=2&amp;t=175446&amp;start=15). I really feel that ratifies my suspicions of car insurance websites. Here's a [23 year old who got quotes for £380 for a Ka, £1100 for a BMW M3 Coupe](http://www.bimmerforums.co.uk/forum/f74/2002-e46-m3-insurance-quote-t87143/).

I found those using [this advanced google search to cut out SEO crap](http://www.google.com/search?q=ford%20ka%20insurance%20site:uk%20inurl:forum) - that might be worth the OP giving it a read.

As for fully comprehensive and third party - the older your car, the less likely they are to bother repairing it in an accident.  They'll just right it off and give you a small amount of money to replace it.  That's why prices of fully comprehensive and third party converge as the car gets older.

This is the danger of not being very *very* clear about the circumstances in which assisted dying is envisioned. It easily slides from being about ending the fact of unnecessary suffering with no hope of relief to being about escaping an imagined future suffering or humiliation.

So you're right, it's not assisted dying in itself that might 'encourage' people, it's the way in which it's implemented and understood.

I actually thought that was the issue at the moment - some people have gone to Switzerland because they won't be able to when they have reached a point of their illness.

Having said that, I have known (and known of) people who would rather die than go through being looked after. My 'grandfather', for want of a better term, who died last year pleaded with my grandmother (his carer) to help him die but she couldn't. If she hadn't have been looking after him and he'd been in 'public' care I think he would have taken measures a couple of years earlier when he first had a stroke.

I'm not sure I can separate terminal illness from not wanting to be looked after. Certainly many of the older people I know are too proud to want to go into a home or similar. My own parents have made that very clear.

You would want legislation to separate the two completely? Actually I think it's clear they need to be, and I can also see the ice-flow section being more open to abuse than the other.",0,1313761751,null,0,false,0,c2dn53m,t3_jmybj,t1_c2dn53m,t1_c2dn281,1427492069,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

And of course, her increased premium because she had an accident (even though non-fault I believe it still ups the premium these days?).

It's a positive feedback to some extent, I think. Ten years back when I was learning to drive I was rear-ended. Both cars written off, completely not my fault and pretty much settled the same day. I slammed back into my seat so hard it was skewed on the runners. My mother had back problems *anyway* but was in a lot of pain. My own neck hurt like hell. It didn't even occur to us at the time to claim. Must be a certain mindset of people to think ""Ooo! Cash!"".

Being anti-suicide is not the problem. Everyone should be anti-suicide. I mean, come on, who's pro-suicide?! I think the language is a problem here, as is the general understanding of what we mean by suicide. People sometimes think of suicide as a free rational choice, which is the last thing it is. I don't think assisted dying - which should be a free rational choice - should be referred to as suicide, and I think the fact that it is is what gets some of the anti- crowd's heckles up as it sounds to them like the pro- camp are trying to normalise suicide.

&gt; The issue for me is that the number is small enough that some on the anti side think it is insignificant.

I don't believe they think it's insignificant, I think they just worry about the wider impact it will have (or are implacably opposed on religious grounds). To them it's a 'lesser of two evils' type of deal.

Again, I think the coroner approach will satisy 99.9999% of us, on both sides of the argument.

My tips for lower insurance when you are 17...

Get a car worth about as much as a t-shirt... with an alarm (preferably).

As low insurance group as possible (like 3 or less).

As smaller engine as possible (1 litre preferably, a 1.2 will be a lot more expensive... no really).

Get 3rd party only insurance with no commuting (unless you are commuting).

Get as higher excess as possible - if you bin the car, it isn't worth enough to claim for anyway.

Get low limited miles (like 3000pa).

Adding parents as named drivers will lower your premium (add your mum first) - don't be a named driver on their policy. You won't earn NCB and it is technically illegal if you are driving the car more than they are (which unless you share the car, you probably will be).

Don't bother with trackers or stupid things like that, they really don't lower insurance. They are more about getting something you are very attached to/rare back again.

My cheapest quote was around £4500. I had hundreds of suggestions from redditors how to get the price down.

I tried, what seemed like, a hundred different insurance companies, through online quotes, phone calls, post etc. I tried changing the details on insurance forms, tried increasing/decreasing annual mileage, changing main drivers, changing type of cover, basically everything I could possibly do to get a lower price. There was absolutely no change.

90% of Redditors kept telling me to try more things, not realising that they do not have any effect on the final price. So I will be the one to tell you this - **you will NOT get a cheaper quote.** And even if you will, it will be a couple of hundred quid less than what you have right now, which will still add up to £4500 a year.

How did I solve the problem? I passed my CBT and got 125cc motorbike (2011 Honda CBR 125 R). Absolutely happy with it. The insurance on that is £260 a year, with provisional license, fuel consumption is really low (around 70mpg), the top speed is around 80mph, so you can still ride on dual carriageways and not piss people behind you off.

That said, if you want to try to wrap your mind around it all as one consistent universe, I'd watch Blink, Waters of Mars, Father's Day and A Christmas Carol (in that order).

In Blink, you get to see that cause and effect are more complicated that simply a road you travel back and forth along.  (""Wibbly wobbly"" is really the universal answer to how to get out of any time travel conversation in Who).

In Waters of Mars, you get the idea that not all points of time are equal.  There is a topology to time itself, a mix of mountains and plains that look the same on a 2-dimensional map but are very different experiences when actually walking across them.  This roughness of time is a dimension to the universe that Doctor can see that is invisible to us humans.  (I could go off on a long tangent about the mathematics of fractal attractors here, but I'd better not)

In Father's Day, you see the bad (and very non-intuitive) things that can start to happen when a time traveller crosses their own timeline in the Doctor Who universe.  It's more complex than just a butterfly effect changing the future, it's ripping the fabric of time and space itself into dimensions that are hard for us to wrap our heads around.

In a Christmas Carol we see The Doctor push the boundaries.  He can't pop back and prevent the ship from getting in trouble, but he does spot an opportunity in the topology of time where he can ""safely"" tweak one person's past to affect the present. 

So the way I see it, it's not that he *couldn't* go back in time at the end of ""The Girl in the Fireplace"", it's that he had to decide if it was worth crossing those mountains and risking tearing a hole in the universe when he got there.

The whole system is screwed up. It was screwed up almost from day 1 of privatisation and to be honest isn't really offering either the train companies or the general public a good service at the moment.     

Instead of running railways like air-space with companies able to run any trains they want but they must bid against one another for track space, they created a big nonsense schedule and had train companies bid to run that entire schedule.    

The real gotcha is that they sell both profitable and unprofitable schedules and the entire thing seems to have been pulled out of someone's ass. There is no free market economics, there is no clever computer system matching passenger numbers with trains running, it is just ""random.""    

I think I can prove how nonsense the current system is with one fact:    

 - Southampton to London: Train - £32, Coach - £14

Now how does a coach which takes longer and consumes more expensive fuel cost less than a faster train running on electric tracks? This should be impossible.

It could have compromised national security however, that and there wasn't complete evidence of any one individual's overriding culpability.  Hence the open verdict.

That's justice.

&gt; What about the people who decided to execute a man when the official addvice on suicide bombers is to keep them alive. 

Advice is not an order.  Some people on the ground still have to make calls.  One man legally armed decided to shoot one man who he thought to be a suicide bomber in a busy confined place on bad intelligence.  It's a tragedy.  Nothing more.   I also suspect that you've just made up ""this advice"" much as you made up that the bullets they used were illegal.  They weren't, they were standard police issue, high energy transfer rounds designed to stay in and cause increased damage to whatever tissue it hits, making them far safer in built up populated areas.

With Tomlinson it is utterly irrelevant what happens to the officer now - it's out of police and IPCC hands.  It's before the Crown.  They did an investigation and the CPS put him up for manslaughter.  That's all the IPCC could have done and they did it 10/10.  There was no dodgy postmortem on the IPCC's part, there was no refusal to investigate.  The family lodged a complaint (30th November) with the IPCC over a DI giving incorrect information to a pathologist.  The IPCC officially launched an investigation 2nd December.

Just keep your wits about you near certain spots of an evening.  Believe me, you'll know the spots I mean when you see the riff-raff crawling in and out.  You can usually spot bad-eggs a mile away in Belfast but if you keep yourself to yourself around them, there shouldn't be an issue.

In terms of the best places for a drink, Queens SU is your best bet in terms of affordability.  Not to mention that the staff are usually friendly.  Probably best to avoid any of the club nights there though, depending on your taste.  Personally, the Connected night there on Mondays always appeals to my 19 year old sensibilities but it's usually filled with undergrads and might not be up your alley.

If it's a quality night you're looking for though, you really can't beat the Back Bar at Lavery's (on any night but a Saturday) or The Duke Of York (to which it is **imperative** to visit if you're looking a good Guinness.)

No it is not. It's insurance fraud. If you read the contract you signed with your insurer, it will specify that the policyholder must be the main driver, or words to that effect.

The police aren't going to do anything about it if they pull you over; they can't prove you're not the main driver. But your insurance policy is not worth the paper it is written on. If you get into an accident — as so many young drivers do — **your insurance company will not pay out, and they may also take legal action against you to recover the cost of damages to third parties**.

Even if you don't have an accident, fronting only provides temporary relief from the cost of insurance. No insurance company offers a transferable No Claims Bonus (NCB) for named drivers.

The items in the car will have little bearing on whether the insurance company pay out. You will have to explain where you were going when you had the accident. You're still in school, and had an accident at 9am between your house and school, while your parents have their own cars for getting to work?

They're not going to payout. Worse than that, if you cause damage to third parties, your insurance company may take legal action against you to recover those costs.

My ideal world solution would be to replace all trains with many smaller, automatically driven coach like vehicles which can run on the routes, and push each other along if they break down / to draft and save energy.  They would come far more frequently, and turn around at terminus stations rather than stopping and reversing leading to big waits for platforms to become available.

My very amateur reckoning is that at the point we send someone to prison we have failed. Once someone goes to prison (a) they will struggle to get employment again (as if it wasn't hard enough); (b) they will probably get a hard drug addiction and (c) also related to 'b' and 'a', is that they will almost certainly commit at least one more crime, and that crime will probably be more serious.

Okay, you seem to misunderstand. Insurance fraud is both a criminal and civil offence. The criminal offence is fraud by false representation (Section 2 of the Fraud Act 2006). 

Short of admitting the offence to a police officer, there is practically nothing you can say or do at the roadside that would give an officer reasonable suspicion to arrest you for that crime. I'm sure it has happened, but it would be exceptionally rare for a person to be arrested at the roadside on suspicion of insurance fraud. Certainly they would not be able to build up enough evidence for a criminal conviction based on a simple traffic stop.

That's not your main concern.

&gt; You were running late so drove in the spare car while you normally take the bus. Your parents have their own cars, or whatever. Luckily, we live in a country where you don't need to justify owning as many cars as you want.

Unfortunately, although you do not have to justify having multiple cars, you *will* have to explain yourself to your insurance company in the event of an accident. You will have signed a contract with your insurance company, in which you agreed — in legalistic terms — that if they suspected you of false representation, the insurance will be invalid. The burden of proof is on *you* to demonstrate you were not committing fraud.

Insurance companies have seen it all before. They have entire departments dedicated to finding loopholes that enable them not to payout. 

An 18-year-old who has just passed their test, taking out a new insurance policy with a parent as the policyholder, on a cheap hatchback, while their parents have cars of their own? The 18-year-old driving the car when they have an accident, en route from their home to the school where they study? Insurance companies are many things, but they aren't stupid.

&gt; Loads of people do this, the easy option is to not drive like an idiot, and you'll be fine. Then if you do have an accident and it's not your fault, you don't need to worry, as you claim on the other person's insurance.

Loads of people were involved in the riots last week. That doesn't make it legally or morally justified.

What you probably don't realise is that by fronting you are actively harming other young drivers. If you expose insurance companies to significant risk (i.e. by being a young driver with relatively little experience on the roads) and you do not adequately compensate them for that risk (by making representation that you are, in fact, the main driver of the car for which a policy is taken out, and paying a correspondingly high premium) then someone else has to. 

Who gets hit the hardest? The people who present the most risk, the young drivers who are honest and take out policies as the policyholder.",0,1313776436,null,0,false,0,c2dp49y,t3_jnr5j,t1_c2dp49y,t1_c2domf2,1427493003,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1
