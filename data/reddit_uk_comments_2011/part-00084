true,stronimo,cnty-wales,Cardiff,"Banking is the industry that failed. Banks are meant to allocate capital to businesses and consumers efficiently; instead, they gave credit to anyone who wanted it. Banks are supposed to make money by managing the risk of transforming short-term debt into long-term loans; instead, it bromke them. They are supposed to expedite the flow of credit through economies; instead, they ended up blocking it. 

The idea that financial markets can be left to police themselves turned out to be the world’s most expensive mistake, requiring $15 trillion in capital injections and other forms of support.

At the peak of the madness, the median large bank had borrowings of **37 times** its equity, meaning it could be wiped out by a loss of just 3% of its assets. That's a **median** large bank, not one of the troublemakers.

Products were so complex, and the chains from borrower to end-investor so long, that thorough due diligence was impossible. A proper understanding of a typical [Collateralised Debt Obligation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collateralized_debt_obligation) required reading **30,000** pages of documentation. 

Everywhere incentives were misaligned. Large banks were ""too big to fail"". Scrutiny of borrowers was delegated to rating agencies, who were paid by the debt-issuers. Fees for securitisers were paid upfront, increasing the temptation to originate, flog and forget. Banks had the attitude that  ""as long as the music is playing you've got to get up and dance"" (Chuck Prince, Citigroup, 2007). Performance was judged relative to rivals, encouraging banks to copy each other in risk taking, to no long-term benefit.

Banking is an industry that has failed the test of the market-place. It cost the world $15 trillion to learn that lesson. Let's not let the money be wasted.",0,1323783872,null,0,true,0,c37nf9e,t3_na6ab,t1_c37nf9e,t1_c37n9w9,1428014654,0,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,0

This may have been answered elsewhere, but you'll need a job with a UK-based company, so you can pay UK tax and social security, to even be allowed in to the country on anything other than a time-limited tourist (i.e. non-working) visa. Having a job with a company in the States that you can continue to do regardless of your geographical location is no good. You usually need to get a company in Europe to offer you a job before you arrive, and sponsor your visa application, to even enter the country (possibly the entire EU) for work. It's the same for us if we want to go to the US or Canada for work.

This is assuming you want to do it by the book and tell the truth at immigration, of course. Your alternative would be to come into the country on a tourist visa and then work illegally, but any serious employer (i.e. someone paying you other than cash in hand) will need to see your visa to register you for tax etc, so you'd probably find it very hard to find the sort of job you want.",0,1323784351,null,0,false,0,c37ngs6,t3_nasvb,t1_c37ngs6,t1_c37mo6l,1428014671,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

True, but knowing right from wrong doesn't mean someone fully comprehends the consequences of doing the thing that's wrong, and I think you have to accept and understand that and their mental capacity when prosecuting them. Children - younger than 10 - frequently do things they definitely know to be wrong despite being told what will happen if they do it. 

I realise I'm not suggesting an alternative, but I don't think even a 15 year old will really comprehend what 10 years in prison means - even if they can understand that doing something that would result in such a severe sentence must be pretty heinous.

true,Antagony,eng-yorkshire,Yorkshire Pudding,"I have to disagree. Their coverage has been immeasurably better than ITV's was – especially when you take into account the ""extras"" they've provided through online service such as the live driver tracker and driver-cam. But there again, I was such an avid follower of the sport that I found the ad breaks almost intolerable, so I guess I'm somewhat biased.

No, in my opinion, the biggest mistake the BBC made was not monetizing the evident popularity of their coverage overseas. If you regularly visited online F1 sites such as  [r/formula1](http://www.reddit.com/r/formula1) over the last few seasons, you would have seen countless posts from people asking how they could get the BBC coverage. Mostly, their only option was to use unreliable video relay sites or wait for the torrents to get posted. I'm sure the vast majority of them would have been willing to fork out something to get it legally. Hell, even as a licence-fee payer, *I* would be willing to fork something out for it, if it meant I could keep the same coverage as before and not have Sky getting their filthy mitts on the sport! I believe that way they could have easily more than covered the money they've saved in this shitty deal they've come to with Sky and FOM to share the coverage.

true,specofdust,scot-Highlands,Pasty Faced Haggis Rider,"&gt;Banking is the industry that failed.

But it didn't. Some banks failed to properly manage themselves, and as a result many businesses and individuals across the world are suffering. This is as much a nature of the modern interconnected world as it is of profit-making banks.

&gt;Banks are meant to allocate capital to businesses and consumers efficiently; instead, they gave credit to anyone who wanted it.

Again with the gross generalisations. This is stupid, there are probably several hundred thousand, if not over a million banking organisations in this world. A few made very stupid lending decisions in the persuit of short term profits enabled by deregulation of the US banking sector and unwise choices by a significant proportion of the US population.

&gt;The idea that financial markets can be left to police themselves turned out to be the world’s most expensive mistake, requiring $15 trillion in capital injections and other forms of support.

Few would claim this besides libertarians and they'd have let the banks collapse and millions starve. You seem to fundamentally not understand the fact though that recession is part of the game if you want to advance faster. 10 steps forward 1 step back is preferable to 2 steps forward, yeah?

&gt;At the peak of the madness, the median large bank had borrowings of 37 times its equity, meaning it could be wiped out by a loss of just 3% of its assets. That's a median large bank, not one of the troublemakers.

Right, as I said, leveraging. To disagree with it qualitatively is just to desire the modern economy doesn't exist. To disagree quantitatively is just to disagree by degree. You're unhappy with 37 times but maybe you'd be happy with 10 times. That's not a fundamental issue, it's one to be tweaked and considered at length.

&gt;Products were so complex, and the chains from borrower to end-investor so long, that thorough due diligence was impossible. A proper understanding of a typical Collateralised Debt Obligation required reading 30,000 pages of documentation.

Ever looked at the legal system of a western country? Complex doesn't mean bad.

&gt;Large banks were ""too big to fail"".

I wonder who's to blame for that...

&gt;Scrutiny of borrowers was delegated to rating agencies, who were paid by the debt-issuers. Fees for securitisers were paid upfront, increasing the temptation to originate, flog and forget.

Again, in a **small number of banks**. You are tarring a massive industry with the sins of a few, I'm not even going to be polite enough to call that disingenuous, I'm just going to come out and say it's a lie when applied to ""banks"" (which universally means ""all banks"".

&gt;Banking is an industry that has failed the test of the market-place. It cost the world $15 trillion to learn that lesson. Let's not let the money be wasted.

Just like the failure in 1929, or in the late 50's, or in the late 60's? Or the mid 70's? How about the early 90's? Then too?

Yet world GDP per capita has more than quadrupled in that time period, and the entire world has always continued to use the current financial industry.

By the way, what do you think Scotrail's policy is for situations such as this? The ""guard"" should have contacted the appropriate authorities and had them deal with the situation.

I hope that he gets sacked and the bully-boy (and the ""guard"" who overstepped his authority in assisting him) are prosecuted for assault.

Taking the law into our own hands, no matter what the level of ""public approval"", is never good nor beneficial.

As for Scotrail, I've travelled on them for years, often pass through that station and I can only think of one time where a train has been held up for the police, and that was following an assault. Holding the train just for a fare dodger seems unlikely. I think the ticket collecter would eventually have given up, and the boy would have got away with it.

I'm not sure about the ticket collector instigating it though, not in the way you mean. We don't see the start so who knows. Although speaking anecdotally again, I have had one or two collecters be extremely rude to me, once when I mistakenly gave him the wrong ticket.

What I think is that this happens often, and that there is little that anyone can do about it, which is breeding a simmering resentment. A lot of people are afraid of young men, sometimes with good reason. They feel threatened by them.

You may be right about this kind of thing eventually leading to lynch mobs, and that is not a way I want to go, nor would most people. I can't see how prosecuting the big man would be anything but counter productive though. People are feeling this anger because they are helpless, and because they see thugs getting away with crime. It would lead to another huge row about political correctness, it would make people feel that the world had turned upside down. The Daily Mail would go spare.

I do find the glee with which some have greeted this (and I joined in a bit too) to be a bit concerning, but it is probably just a bit of letting off steam, easing the pressure. If we start seeing copycats or vigilantes then yes, we have a bigger problem, and I hope that doesn't happen.

Is the flack justified? Partly, yes.

The programme is sold on the premise that it is basically 45 mins of amazing wildlife behaviour, filmed in the wild. While I understand that some scenes are either impossible or too expensive to film in the wild, there should be some form of indication to this fact, whether through a caption on the appropriate scenes, or a statement at the end, or whatever, it should be addressed during the programme, not online days later.

That said, I'm not particularly shocked by this revelation, as the same thing happened when it was revealed that they did similar during filming of a previous series on deep sea life, which is more evidence that this is unrelated to current events.

Often in Manchester, especially on Oxford road, chavs board the bus and refuse to pay. The bus driver has seen it all before and simply tells them he's not moving until they get off the bus or pay the fare. Three times in the 2 years I've been here I've given up waiting and gotten off the bus to wait for a new one - but it's a frequent occurrence.

Who do these pricks think they are? Why do thy think they're entitled to free transport when the rest of us should pay? They have no consideration for me, my time or that of any other passengers - therefore I have no consideration for them. 

Calling the responsible authorities takes far too long for the other passengers and ties up resources - police time, that of a squad car, the time it takes to drive the fare dodger to the police station and process him, and the courts systems should he get charged. This amounts to hundreds if not thousands of £ of OUR tax  money, wasted.

Or are you suggesting that paying customers subsidise the neds and we allow all fare dodgers a free ride? If so, how would you attempt to stop everyone from taking advantage of this? 

The alternative is someone throws the fare dodger off and we all go on our merry way, except for the dare dodger who will hopefully learn not to do it again.

I think we have 3 choices:

- Call police, spend lots of ££, waste everyone's time in the process waiting for arrival of 'responsible authorities', and on a train potentially holding up other trains and causing a backlog on the line
- Allow fare dodgers free ride
- Chuck him off

And don't worry - I'm sure the conductor in this video (a redditor in the last thread knows him) will be sacked for not reporting the incident, and Scotland's neds and England's chavs will know that they can dodge fares with no repercussions - inconveniencing the rest of us in the process.",0,1323818038,null,0,true,0,c37sxiq,t3_nb5we,t1_c37sxiq,t1_c37siix,1428017245,18,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,18

The ""old uniformed"" was, indeed, however, by his own words, willing to hold the train because of a fare dodger.

I would ask, again:  what if this was just a boy with o money trying to get home?

The impotent old man with the power of a ticket machine and a uniform showed a complete lack of compassion, and his arrogant ""jobsworth"" attitude did embarrass the young boy to react in a way that was inappropriate (but, had the situation been handled differently -and anybody, before they are let loose on the public should be able to demonstrate at least a degree of empathy and diplomacy- this never needed to happen).

Those who cheered were, to my mind, a bunch of relieved wimps who either did not have the courage to do anything themselves or sheep who fell into a typical ""herd mentality"", and they, equally, should be ashamed of themselves.

As to the ""rat race"":  Its very point is to make us rat on each other, and the old impotent uniform and the bully boy, ratting on the young boy, proved themselves to be just that ... rats.

true,tealess,null,null,"In my experience as a Brit, US TV tends to struggle with complex characters. It's not a rule, just a tendancy. So it would depend a lot on who was playing the doctor.

Doctor Who also has a lot of very typically British humour, and I feel like if it was an American show, it'd be more serious for more of the time.

Thinking of things like Daleks with a bigger budget, you've got to consider that a lot of the fear which is created of the Doctor's enemies is created by the actors rather than the things themselves (because of how cheaply they were put together in the first place), the Dalek voice is pretty fuckin' scary, but they look so stupid that they're more comical than frightening. This has created, in my view, a more lasting and *real* sense of fear around these things. If there was a bigger budget to put towards creating more visually frightening things, this dynamic might not have been created.

Most American action/drama shows tend to involve a shitload of guns/weapons. Compare, for example, American cop shows to British ones, and there's usually a lot more action in the US stuff, while the British shows are mostly mental/character stuff, as is Who. So it's difficult to imagine Doctor Who as it is, which is more mind and words over weapons, existing in the same way if it had been made in the US.

Overall, clearly it would be a very different show. I'd guess it would have more regular dramatic action sequences. It'd probably have a very different kind of humour, and possibly a more serious focus.

I watched Hartnell and thought, this is ""TruWho"". When Troughton came along I thought, ""He's too silly! I can't take him seriously!"". But then to Pertwee, ""He's too serious!"". But by the end of each regeneration I'm sad to see them go.

But gosh once I got to seven's era, every episode made me grin and laugh.

Of the new Doctors, I thought that Smith was my favorite soon after he started. Then I went back and watched Tennant and thought that Smith's don't beat the emotion in Tennant's. Then I watched Eccleston and said that none beats him.

Now and finally, I resolve that seventh is my favorite, of new Who nine has my favorite personality, eleven has the best run, and ten has the most tear jerking.

It is not pretty and I do not like it, but this is the world we live in and what you saw here was a culmination of all the frustrations, of people forced to commute, a ticket inspector who has to enforce the rules on someone who refuses, passengers who are angry about the delay.

Suddenly someone stands up and resolves the situation. He was brave too, a lot of young men carry knives around here. So he is a hero for five minutes. 

This is how people have worked forever. Violence is a solution that is never far away. People like it because it works, it solves the immediate problem.

Someone who is inconsiderate and abusive is, to me, a prick.


The young boy without money, if that is the case, would do well to explain his situation rather than lying to the conductor (he's trying to use an invalid ticket and won't admit the games up). Furthermore and I believe more importantly, the redditor in the earlier thread mentions that the distance to the station the kid was trying to get to was within walking distance. I'm far too young to be saying this, but 'when I was a kid' I regularly walked 2 hours to friends houses, too and from house parties, because public transport didn't exist. 


This kid should have realised he wasn't going anywhere, stood up and departed the train. The choice was his, it was offered to him numerous times, yet he chose to stay there. He made his decision and being ejected - as one would be from a nightclub or other premises where one had outstayed their welcome - was the consequence. Indeed I'm sure he'd be happier with that result than, say, the £250 fare dodging fine, but that's pure conjecture.


As far as the whole 'subsidising' though, the singular instance may not make much difference but if it's turned a blind eye to, it will happen with increasing frequency as more people realise that you'd be a mug (or simply honest) to buy a ticket if it's easier to just dodge the fare.",0,1323822017,null,0,false,0,c37tk31,t3_nb5we,t1_c37tk31,t1_c37t4bn,1428017543,9,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,9

The only thing we have going for us, is the fact it is a bit more rainy than you might expect.


The UK is English-Speaking and shares all the cultural similarities that the Anglo-Sphere has. This might make you notice the differences more but it really it is quite similar to the US. We share many of the same flaws too.

I was, and to a certain extent, am still frustrated by the lack of police authority present in that episode. But it was thanks to that episode that I got a general idea for how deaths might potentially be treated in Misfits over the upcoming series.

Misfits has evolved from series one and two. Let's face it, the first few episodes of the third series were pretty lacklustre in comparison to the general quality of episodes from series one and two. The greatest amount of continuity in the third series came from episodes 5 to 7, but there was always this archaic emphasis on the Freak of the Week formula. Personally, I don't think Overman can afford to re-introduce continuity so late into the series. It brings in a lot of unneeded dissonance, and let's face facts - he fucked the first few episodes up (third series) if we judge them solely in terms of a consistent story line and plot (usually you'd like to spend the first few episodes establishing what the latest series will revolve around; Overman didn't bother adapting that approach). Personally, I think Overman is just concentrated on salvaging the reputation of the series. If he introduces continuity and inter-episodic struggles for the main characters now via the deaths, it gives critics something to complain about ('Why weren't the first few episodes made to establish an inciting incident? Why is the latest series so disconnected?). I think that's why the last few Misfits episodes have had more of a standalone feel to them. There was the consistent thread of Kelly's blossoming relationship with Seth, but it wasn't something that needed any more than a single episode to build up or make clear to viewers. All they (the viewers) really needed to know amidst the last few episodes and their main plotlines was that the chavvy bird was somewhat into the bloke with the neck tattoo, and that he felt the same despite his itching desire to bring his dead girlfriend back to life. 

If Misfits gets renewed for a fourth series, I wouldn't be surprised if Overman decided to re-introduce some continuity. Rudy has pretty much warmed up to a fair amount of the fan base, so he won't have to bother trying to develop the character from scratch (which he was somewhat forced to do for the first few episodes of the third series). The fact that they'll all be getting new powers in the next episode is also a pretty good indication that things are far from over for the ASBO kids.",0,1323830109,null,0,false,0,c37usqr,t3_naxeh,t1_c37usqr,t3_naxeh,1428018195,3,false,misfitstv,t5_2s8pg,3

And yes, I could and have lived on 67 pounds a week (actually the lower rate for U25, which is 55 pounds a week). As long as you have all the kit, vacuum cleaner, pots and pans, a set of clothes, so you don't have buy everything at once, it is fine. I actually ate at that time as I always do, which is well. It's no frills, no phone contract, no TV, not much going out. I quite enjoyed it, but then I do have hermit tendencies. 

If we're going to complain about the system, it's the job centres I'd point at. It's much more demeaning coming up against the bureaucracy, to go and stand every week in a gaggle of people leaning against the walls of the job centre, having to turn up on time, and always waiting 15-45 minutes to be asked a handful of preset questions before being sent on your way. To give you an idea, at one stage they stopped giving out the little plastic wallets to keep the various papers in, to save costs (I suppose 10p per claimant resulting in a fair amount of hassle). After the job centre, the problem is the general inactivity of being unemployed. If we're talking solutions, the job centres need to be completely overhauled, root and branch, and made useful, then I quite like the idea of people working voluntary jobs as part of their claim, as long as you have a veto, or can choose yourself where you work. But broadly, the system is kind.

Edit: I should mention I don't know about families. My experience was only as a single person without responsibilities. But if we want to talk about sob stories, asylum seekers are, it seems to me, more worthy of attention. Claimants are banned from working and given 35 quid a week. They also arrive in the country without friends or family, often from traumatic experiences, with poor language skills, culture shock and no possessions whatsoever. A support worker I know has visited asylum seekers living in flats which are complete shells. If you spend 15 quid on food, and 5-10 quid on everything else, which is a real stretch, it'll be years before you have a couple of sets of clothes, kitchen stuff and a sofa.

I read the article thinking it was going to be similar to the one from a few weeks back that claimed a couple couldn't live comfortably on £50,000 p.a. between them (I think it was on the BBC) 

Until about 5 minutes ago, I thought I was living close to the bread line, worried about Christmas and panicing because I have about £50 left until I get paid on the 22nd of this month.

Then I read the article linked and came across the names of Mark and Helen Mullins.

I have honestly honestly honestly never cried over something that I've read online or in a newspaper etc.

That changed 5 minutes ago.

As I sit here with my 32"" TV, my Xbox 360, a laptop, broadband, running hot water, heating and a full stomach I felt sick, sick at myself that I could believe I was barely scraping by and how selfish I feel for thinking I was in a bad place financially. To say I feel like a complete dickhead for taking all these material things and the fact I have the basics that people deserve like hot water, heating and a roof over my head for granted doesn't even begin to describe how I feel right now

I also feel sick that I live in a country that has let this happen to a family and probably other familes currently.

true,jobless_scum,null,null,"OK. This is a throwaway. I'm not even a regular poster here, I'd just rather not have it come up in discussions later on.

I am on jobseekers allowance.  Because of a stint as self-employed a while ago where I didn't pay enough national insurance and the fact I live with my girlfriend I currently receive £45 a week to spend on whatever I like. It's probably fair enough- I missed £400 in NI. They do pay around 3/4 of our rent in housing benefit though which keeps a roof over our heads.

My girlfriend is making just enough to get by- maybe £500-600 a month in a shop at minimum wage. I scrounge off her. It's not as good as it sounds though. If she works more they will reduce our housing benefit accordingly (and probably my JSA although I'm not sure) and we're back to square one. If we lie we can go to jail for benefit fraud. My landlord receives £150 per week or so from our housing benefit. He's a nice guy, though he put the rent up a few weeks ago and the housing benefit wont cover it, so a chunk of my JSA is going to straight to him too.

I'm a graduate, I have always worked other than being a student. I want to work. My girlfriend is a graduate too. I have a long, long list of jobs I have applied for including the Royal Mail Christmas jobs mentioned in the article. If I receive a 'thank you for applying' email I feel I'm making progress. Most of the time nothing happens. Interviewers have told me I'm lucky as they got 300 applications for the job and I was in the final 30. We have a gas/electricity bill for £160 which is so far unpaid and setting up a direct debit will be mostly pointless if the money's not there. I also have a bank loan which needs payments to begin in February and if I'm not working by then I am screwed. I have sold most of my shit on ebay already.

Perhaps I'm scum. Perhaps I have a sense of entitlement or am being too fussy with what jobs I want to apply for. My 'jobseeker advisor' wants me to do voluntary work -but I will still be benefit scrounging scum. I go to the jobcentre once or twice a week for an hour or two where I am told to remove my uni education from my CV to get more interviews. I'm going there in the morning.

I think he could work perfectly with/behind Torres, simply through his ability to make great passes and his movement drawing defenders away from Torres, and vice versa. When you have two deadly players up front, suddenly the opposing CBs' jobs become much harder. Up until now, Suarez has been getting swarmed by defenders, but with a threat like Torres lurking nearby, you can basically only afford one CB per player, and both Suarez and Torres excel at beating sole defenders. I think they could become a very scary combination.  ",0,1323835739,null,0,false,0,c37vnhn,t3_nbo7a,t1_c37vnhn,t1_c37vi4b,1428018596,1,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1

Hoilett is young and pacey, but a very risky signing who could end up being very much like Walcott. He is not clinical in front of goal and tends to go missing in games.

When 9 regenerated into 10 he kind of imprinted on her (adopting her accent, etc...) so that drew me in because I saw how much he cared about her. Rose herself was gung-ho from the beginning. She was always up for the adventure, and watching her and Ten in the first few episodes of the second season, you can see how much they love it.

When she left, it was horrible for me, and I related to that story really really well (I've lost someone very suddenly like that... without the whole universe thing) so it rang a true chord with me. I had gotten really attached to the idea of them being together and then BAM.

As far as Martha goes, I actually liked her. I mean, seriously, if you are a young girl and Ten shows up being all mouthy and smart and a little touchy, having a crush on him is not that far fetched. Despite her one sided feelings, Martha was tough, she babysat him through Family of Blood, was very quick to help out, and was very intelligent. Her departure was really noble, in my opinion. Not a lot of girls are willing to walk away from a life like that... a life they love and someone they really like... just because they know it's the smart thing to do.

&gt; “It would completely ruin the atmosphere and destroy the pleasure of the viewers. It’s not a falsehood. How far do you take this?’

Saying all that though, the chances that the train station guy printed him two singles going in the same way are 0. It's also impossible on a train service for 2 singles to be cheaper than a return.

Not as an every day cost it doesn't. There is no difference in grant/loan income to students as there was before the increase in tuition fees. 
But this does not negate the fact that the overall loan cost, and weight round the neck in terms of debt is much higher.

We have done nothing to tackle the class split in education.

We have done nothing to tackle the criminal culture where people quite literally are criminals for life with no hope of escape and will be a burden on the taxpayer their entire days.

The full lyrics are:

&gt;The bum on the rods is hunted down  
&gt;As the enemy of mankind  
&gt;The other is driven around to his club  
&gt;Is feted, wined and dined.  
&gt;And they who curse the bum on the rods  
&gt;As the essence of all that is bad,  
&gt;Will greet the other with a winning smile,  
&gt;And extend the hand so glad.  


&gt;The bum on the rods is a social flea  
&gt;Who gets an occasional bite,  
&gt;The bum on the plush is a social leech,  
&gt;blood sucking day and night.  
&gt;The bum on the rod is a load so light  
&gt;That his weight we scarcely feel,  
&gt;But it takes the labor of dozens of men  
&gt;To furnish the other a meal.  


&gt;As long as you sanction the bum on the plush  
&gt;The other will always be there,  
&gt;But rid yourself of the bum on the plush  
&gt;And the other will disappear.  
&gt;Then make an intelligent, organised kick  
&gt;Get rid of the weights that crush.  
&gt;Don't worry about the bum on the rods,  
&gt;Get rid of the bum on the plush.  ",0,1323853760,null,0,false,0,c37xqva,t3_nbn8f,t1_c37xqva,t1_c37tsxb,1428019583,5,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,5

Now imagine another universe where you spend your nights being fucked by strangers for money. Do you think both alternate yous are going to be equally (un)happy?

Ok, so flipping burgers is a soul destroying job where I have to work my arse off for minimum wage for 8 hours a day with very little to show for it at the end other than smelling of chip fat and grease.

Spending my nights being fucked by strangers for money, for the purposes of this thought experiment as a job would mean that I'd probably find it difficult to maintain a sexual relationship, I'd have a lot more money, I'd probably feel pangs of guilt about what I do but I get to choose my hours and if I put the effort into it need to work maybe 2 or 3 hours a week (assume £100/hr) to make the same amount as flipping burgers?

I think it's going to be down to the individual. If I was young and attractive I'd seriously consider it if it was reasonably anonymous and safe (i.e. regulated with a support structure). I don't have a particular problem with it per se, beyond the safety aspect and my (thought experiment) uni friends finding out.

It is possible to live on £67 a week here in the UK. I'd say it's probably easier the further north you go where prices are cheaper compared to say, Guildford or London, but it is possible.

One thing that strikes me is that the poorer you are, the more exposed to price increases you are, particularly in food or VAT. I think we do need an entire overhaul of the welfare state in general. We need to have a proper debate on what the welfare state should and shouldn't provide and that needs to extend as much to education and healthcare as work and pensions. The exact details of how that reform should work need to be decided impassionately and based on evidence, but whatever is the best way forward also needs to strike the right balance of social care and costs for everyone else.

true,UnoriginalGuy,welsh,Wales,"Honestly how many ""key skills"" do ICT teachers need? The subject might have well be called ""Learn Microsoft Office"" because that is essentially what it is.     

&gt; Too many ICT teachers have limited knowledge of key skills, such as computer programming, they said.    

That is all well and good except:    

&gt; Students are taught to use software such as office suites, desktop publishers; they are also taught about ICT theory, and how ICT can be used to solve problems. **Computer programming is not taught at GCSE level.**      

Also this:   
&gt; High-flying students are often not stretched and their interests in the subject are ignored    

Welcome to school. Every subject is like that. School isn't about stretching a child's interests/ability, it is about making sure they learn not to stand out, or otherwise test expectations in any way. The Japanese have a saying which I think applies to UK schools too: *the nail that stands out gets hammered down.*    

&gt; while many pupils spend computing lessons repeating tasks asked of them a year ago     

Again, welcome to school. EVERY CLASS DOES THIS.    

&gt; In half of all secondary schools, the level many school-leavers reach in ICT is so low they would not be able to go on to advanced study, a technician-level course or an apprenticeship in computing or a related subject.    

ICT isn't designed to do that. ICT has no relationship to Computer Science at all. They're completely different subjects. It is like saying ""we're teaching geography badly, so people cannot do world history in college!"" It is nonsense.

true,[deleted],null,null,"It reminds me of this part in Edward Bellamy's [Equality](http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext05/equal10h.htm), written at the end of the 19th Century about how useless the technological improvements had been for the majority of people:

&gt;You may well say so,"" exclaimed the teacher. ""Of what use indeed was it that coal had been discovered, when there were still as many fireless homes as ever? Of what use was the machinery by which one man could weave as much cloth as a thousand a century before when there were as many ragged, shivering human beings as ever? Of what use was the machinery by which the American farmer could produce a dozen times as much food as his grandfather when there were more cases of starvation and a larger proportion of half-fed and badly fed people in the country than ever before, and hordes of homeless, desperate vagabonds traversed the land, begging for bread at every door? They had invented steamships, these ancestors of ours, that were miracles, but their main business was transporting paupers from lands where they had been beggared in spite of labor-saving machinery to newer lands where, after a short space, they would inevitably be beggared again. About the middle of the nineteenth century the world went wild over the invention of the sewing-machine and the burden it was to lift from the shoulders of the race. Yet, fifty years after, the business of garment-making, which it had been expected to revolutionize for the better, had become a slavery both in America and Europe which, under the name of the 'sweating system,' scandalized even that tough generation. They had lucifer matches instead of flint and steel, kerosene and electricity instead of candles and whale-oil, but the spectacles of squalor, misery, and degradation upon which the improved light shone were the same and only looked the worse for it. What few beggars there had been in America in the first quarter of the nineteenth century went afoot, while in the last quarter they stole their transportation on trains drawn by steam engines, but there were fifty times as many beggars. The world traveled sixty miles an hour instead of five or ten at the beginning of the century, but it had not gained an inch on poverty, which clung to it as the shadow to the racer.

And sadly, you can make the same argument now. What use is the machinery, that simply makes workers unemployed, who are then subjected them to lower wages and longer hours? What use is the great improvements in transport and communication when it is used primarily to find the most desperate and impoverished people on the Earth, so they may work as grateful slaves? What use are the improvements in medicines, when they are denied to those who need them most?

It's the 21st Century, you'd think we could use all this technology for the benefit of all, so that we may all live in security, and work only a small part of our lives so we can finally live freely as our full labour is no longer required. But the capitalist system with its terrible mantra ""Your necessity is my opportunity"" turns these blessings in to curses, as all the benefits are monopolised by a few, and exploited to subject the masses of humanity to servitude.

And so it is we have the unbelievable situation that citizens struggle in dire poverty, when science and machinery could allow them to live in security and abundance with little labour at all. So it is that we face simultaneous unemployment and overwork for the employed, as the former is used to drive down conditions of workers. The business owners themselves are not to blame, for they must do so to compete with the other businesses, and so we face the same insanity of the ruthless competition we see in nature, where moose will grow huge antlers which mean they cannot escape predators, solely because if any one moose had smaller antlers then they would be unable to breed. Adam Smith's assumption that what was in the interest of the individual was in the interest of society is wrong, the interest of the individual will lead to the misery of society from the race to the bottom that this competition creates.

And yet people accept this situation and ask nothing, even when we face repeated crisis and a receding quality of life in the face of improving technology. In the face of such absurdity, is it really so strange to ask that we use the communal resources of the Earth for the communal benefit of all?",0,1323856311,null,0,false,0,c37xwuv,t3_nbn8f,t1_c37xwuv,t1_c37v4me,1428019661,11,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,11

true,StuartGibson,,Bangor,"Here we go.

Northern Ireland is part of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, but also part of the island of Ireland. It falls under UK law and uses British currency. The Republic of Ireland is a completely separate country, which uses the Euro and has no rule under UK law. 

Given our, err, unique, history, citizens of Northern Ireland can choose to hold either a British or Irish passport (or even both). 

Some people identify as British (mainly those from a Protestant leaning community) and some identify as Irish (mainly Catholic community). Some identify as a bit of both and some are so pissed off at the pointless fighting they just refer to themselves as Northern Irish, handily skirting the entire issue. 

So, as to why we can't ""move on"" from our British identity, it is because British is the nationality of a lot of the population, in a legal sense. 

So, anyone living in the south is, 100%, Irish. That is the only nationality if you live in the Republic or Ireland. If you live in the north, your nationality can, legally, be either British *or* Irish. If, at some stage in the future, Northern Ireland unites with the Republic of Ireland (which is pretty unlikely in the foreseeable future), then nationality would change to be Irish.

As for embarrassment, the bigots on both side of the equation are equally embarrassing. As an example, two Protestant government ministers caused a furore in the Protestant Orange Order by having the ""audacity"" to attend the funeral of a murdered Catholic police officer. Meanwhile, the Catholic Lord Mayor of Belfast refused to hand a Duke of Edinburgh award  to a 15 year old army cadet.

The roundabout point I'm trying to make is that every operating systems/environment has it's own purpose and no one is better than all the others.

I like the fact that school ICT focusses on Windows/MS Office as that's what most companies use as their default operating system and Microsoft do a very good job at making it easy for technicians to look after large Windows based estates. It makes my life much easier developing software which will be used by people who generally aren't interested in computers but learned how to use Windows/Office in school.

But there's a huge difference between legal nationality and *ethnicity*, that's what I don't get. For example, I could live in Japan for a number of years and through naturalization, I could legally become a Japanese national citizen. But that would not make me ""Japanese"" ethnicially or culturally. My ""nationality"" would be Japanese but my ethnicity would still be Scottish. In the same way, being a ""British citizen"" doesn't say anything about your ethnicity. It's a legal nationality, but not an ethnicity. People from England for example, are legally British citizens and ethnically English. People from Scotland are legally British and ethnically Scottish. So people from NI are legally British citizens and ethnically what? Many people in NI seem to consider being *legally* a British citizen, an ethnicity. That's what I don't get.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt; indeed I would suggest a lot of people in England think of themselves as ethnically British and, specifically, English.

This isn't the case. This is not what polls and surveys on ""British-ness"" have found. What you have described is the ethnic dimension of British identity, but by far the more prevalent perspective of British identity today is what I have described, the legal nationality, or ""civic"" perspective of British identity. 

This is an interesting read from the wikipedia entry: 

&gt; According to the British Social Attitudes Survey, there are broadly two interpretations of British identity, with ethnic and civic dimensions:

&gt;The first group, which we term the ethnic dimension, contained the items about birthplace, ancestry, living in Britain, and sharing British customs and traditions. The second, or civic group, contained the items about feeling British, respecting laws and institutions, speaking English, and having British citizenship.[251]
&gt; Of the two perspectives of British identity, the civic definition has become ""the dominant idea ... by far"",[115] and in this capacity, Britishness is sometimes considered an institutional or overarching state identity.[114][115][140]

&gt; This has been used to explain why first-, second- and third-generation immigrants are more likely to describe themselves as British, rather than English, Scottish or Welsh, because it is an ""institutional, inclusive"" identity, that can be acquired through naturalisation and British nationality law;[254] the vast majority of people in the United Kingdom who are from an ethnic minority feel British.[255]

&gt; However, this attitude is more common in England than in Scotland or Wales; ""white English people perceived themselves as English first and as British second, and most people from ethnic minority backgrounds perceived themselves as British, but none identified as English, a label they associated exclusively with white people"". 

&gt; The Commission for Racial Equality found that with respect to notions of nationality in Britain, ""the most basic, objective and uncontroversial conception of the British people is one that includes the English, the Scots and the Welsh"".[257]

[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_people#Classification]

So what is appartent is that for the vast majority of citizens in the UK, what comes first is their ethnicity. For natives this means English, Scottish or Welsh and for immigrants their ethnicity is based on were their parents came from, ex. Pakistani. Then second comes ""British"" which is used as an institutional, state or civic identity, almost never as an ethnicity. People from NI are really strange in this regard.

Computing is a science, sharing knowledge is the best way to advance the science.

The future cloud environments / virtualisation are mainly Linux based also, the mobile world Linux is booming - Android / possibly webOS so if you really care about the kids future then teaching them Linux is a good idea. (not to mention that most hosting companies are predominantly  Linux based)

'Teaching' kids the Microsoft way is locking them into the matrix and dumbing them down.

Calling someone who knows Windows an IT expert is like calling a McDolands employee a chef.

The real questions are - ""why is it that  most companies use Windows as their default operating system""

The answer is not because their technically better, but more that they use their market position to prevent any competition.

When they got their monopoly it was down to good timing (I personally think that Windows 95 set back computing by at least 5 years - in 1995 a Windows PC was no where near as reliable, fast or productive as am Amiga from 1991) and lack of competition at the time.

It really is fiction to suggest that there's only so many jobs within a country. What instead must be happening is the machine isn't working - some kind of market failure.

As for wages.. I don't advocate a government getting their hands dirty there, I advocate them fixing the market where people have got it rigged. At the moment boards of directors have things rigged, they need to release those cogs so that boards can't decide their own salaries and approve each others.

The government, as I've said, shouldn't be getting their hands too dirty - but they seem to inexplicably be forcing people to work for free with fake apprenticeships and forcing people to work in the voluntary sector, while they talk about the voluntary sector reducing the need for public sector stuff.

I personally like the idea of people on JSA working for the community in some way. However I do not like the idea of them being taken out of the JSA system by giving them horrible labouring jobs and displacing someone else who should be getting paid for it.

It's a tough one, but the system is in place for a reason I think. What not many seem to appreciate is that fare dodger might be telling the truth.

true,[deleted],null,null,"Well exactly, what could be beneficial to everyone is instead harmful. Is there any greater demonstration of failure than when the use of machines that produce abundance simply pushes more people in to want?

That said, it isn't entirely that simple, as it isn't always profitable to automate work. If you can get people to work sub-minimum wage i.e. with workfare) then why on Earth would you automate it? This means that we won't ever reach full automation but instead we will reach some level of stagnation and misery, where the diminishing returns in automation mean it is not worthwhile.

This then actually worsens the conditions, as the low wages mean there is very little expendable income in the economy, and so little demand. This means that businesses won't gain much profit by investing in expanding in production, and further investment yields diminishing returns. This then means that the only way to obtain greater profits is to increase the ""exploitation rate"" of the workers (i.e. the gap between what they are paid, and the full value of their labour - the profit per worker) or to invest the savings in speculation and financialisation where there might still be a return.

This shows that the old justification for this system and its private monopolisation of the resources, factories, etc. no longer holds. No longer does it drive technology forward (for there is no incentive to invest when labour is cheaper)  and nor does it drive investment in production (because this also yields diminishing returns when the market is saturated (note this does not mean there is actual overproduction, merely that people cannot afford to purchase more)).

You mention that we get lower prices, however, because of the profit system, this will never provide us back all the wages lost from unemployment. For the prices are never lowered as far as possible (or else no profit would be made, and the automation is not worthwhile) and nor is the profit made necessarily reinvested in creating other work, because there may be diminishing returns in expanding production, or the other work may be automated itself.

And so we face the situation we have now, of a worsening recession, which there is no real escape from, except for a great redistribution of wealth.",0,1323870159,null,0,false,0,c37yrsj,t3_nbn8f,t1_c37yrsj,t1_c37yjgy,1428020065,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

He could have argued his case as he was ready to leave, and then argued his case again at the station he was being asked to leave, then he could have argued his case in writing to the company. Instead, he decided to ignore the formal request to remove himself from the train and made the active decision to act like a little uneducated twat. At which point, he also decides that it's appropriate to hold the entire train up for everyone else, even swearing at the person simply going about their job in a professional manner.

true,ax4of9,null,null,"I like Podolski too, but he has a habit of playing better for his country than for his club. Also, Lukas plays more like a left winger sometimes, and honestly what we need now is an honest-to-god finisher, not someone who can create chances from out wide. 

Loic Remy's name has been linked with English clubs for the longest time, but there has never been any action taken. I find him a little underwhelming, and to be honest, I would look somewhere other than France for my strikers. 

Lewandowski has benefited from the awesome service he gets at Borussia Dortmund, I wouldn't really value him very highly. 

I agree with with you that we don't really need to buy in any other positions. I know everyone is pissing rocks with Lucas injured and Spearing suspended, but honestly there are only 2 more games until Spearing returns. We currently have Spearing, Henderson, Adam, Shelvey in the centre of midfield, with Gerrard about to return. Buying another midfielder will create overcrowding again once Lucas returns at the end of the season. 

I don't like how we keep speculating about the club buying a top player from another club, because it is frankly not going to happen. Which big club is going to give up their top scoring striker in January? The last time this happened was when Liverpool sold Torres, and that only happened because Liverpool's form at that time did not actually justify calling it a big club. 

If you want to speculate realistically about players that Liverpool could buy, look at younger players who have a hard time breaking into the first team, or slightly more established players who are finishing up their contracts at lower placed clubs. Leave the flavour of the month players to the tabloids, an overhyped, high profile buy right now will hurt the club and the player,

Put yourself forward for Uni?  I was referring to [UCAS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UCAS) which deals with university applications.  You will need some qualifications for that, from either a college or a night school. Typically these are going to be 'A-levels' and are two year courses, but there's nothing stopping you from doing them in one if you want to apply yourself, or even 6 months, or even just registering for the exam and turning up on day one if you're confident enough/smart enough/determined  and disciplined enough to self-teach.  Most students take 3 subject A-levels plus a General Studies A-level (which there is no real study for and a free throwaway one).  You don't even have to wait until you're in the UK.  You can buy A-level study guides on Amazon, but some A-levels have a reputation of being easier than others; Maths, Biology or English Lit for example are going to have more kudos attached to them than say Business Studies or Drama.  I suppose it all depends on what you want to study and when -  there's probably other ways of getting in.  I'm just saying what I know and did myself.

&gt;If what I read is correct I'm only eligible for student loans if I've been a resident for 3+ years so other than that I don't think I could afford it.

That's perfect if you're serious.  Come over enjoy the summer.  Make some mates, get a job, get pissed, take a nightcourse or do some homestudy.  Slap a couple of A-levels in and after you've been here for nearly two years start applying because at the end of three years, the start of the next academic year you'll qualify.

If it was me, and some people might laugh at this, I know exactly what I'd do if you're reasonably physically fit and I were you,  join the circus....Nah, I'm shitting with you....but I'd seriously consider joining the [police](http://www.police-recruitment.com/Police-Entry-Requirements.php) because the pay for not having a degree is pretty alright and they'll even pay you whilst they train you, and it'll be shift work so you could move work around your studies.   I know, yeah, it's the p o l i c e,  but so what...and it aint going to hurt your university application any! As long as you've not been a naughty boy in the past I should imagine they'll snap your hands off.   

But, yeah, fuck it.  If you feel life's going nowhere what've you got to lose?  At least you'll have a hangover and a story.  Thing is with being a backpacker not having any friends or not knowing anyone won't be a problem.  As soon as you walk into the backpacker's hostel eveyone's in the same boat and you just make some.  But mostly I'm more of a 'fuck it' attitude, don't mind getting my feet wet, and just bodge away at something until I understand it a little better.

Either that or they have big pitch problems very often; they tend to sound very dry. 

I heard the girls who won this year and no honestly, they're not good singers. Leona Lewis sounded like she was very good when I heard her; the liquid quality in her voice is what most of them lack. If it was the case that so many were good singers, they wouldn't find themselves be so let down by a song choice, a good singer should be able to pull off practically anything without putting his or her voice in an uncomfortable range.
From the clips I've seen here and there, they tend to have a few decent people towards the middle of the show when the people brought in for fun are cast out (many are actors by the way, I know a girl who was paid to do that) but many of them just aren't marketable. Not least of which because Cowell has teams of songwriters, I'm sure the last thing he wants is people who write and compose. 

Sorry but I really don't think that many of them have been in bands etc. they just don't have that level of ability in my opinion. If they did they wouldn't fuck up like they do. I fuck up onstage sometimes and I've been on stages since the age of five, most of the time, when I do fuckup, it's because I can't hear myself in the PA in front of me (and I'm wearing ear plugs) or the rest of the band is set up on a much higher volume or I'm focusing too much on my guitar-playing. Yes these people are under pressure but they also benefit from some of the best sound equipment you could ever get as well as having the instrumentals on a generally low level and earpieces. Plus they don't even have to worry about the drummer missing a beat or something like that because 99% of the music is a backup track and they'll occasionally have a band that will 'fake' play (I also had a friend, bassist, who used to do that on tv shows).",0,1323879686,null,0,true,0,c37zxui,t3_n9lvf,t1_c37zxui,t1_c37zi81,1428020616,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

I agree that something needs to be done about the ridiculous number of fraudulent claims that seem to get paid out without even being investigated these days, but let's not throw the baby out with the bath water. Not every claim is fraudulent and why should someone who's suffered a genuine personal injury through no fault of their own not seek compensation from the person who *is responsible?

As for what *can* be done: well, for one thing, insurance companies should be required to properly investigate if one of their customers tells them they believe a claim being made against them is fraudulent. I had a very minor bump with a taxi a couple of years ago, which resulted in no damage whatsoever to my car and only a small dent on the taxi. We swapped details and he agreed the damage was minor and said he would let me know what the repair cost be so I could pay for it directly if I wanted to. The next thing I knew he'd put in an absurdly high claim for damages to the car, private medical treatment for whiplash, and loss of earnings! Nether the police nor my insurance company showed even the remotest interest in investigating my charge that he was committing fraud. So *he* got a huge payout and got off scot free with what was unquestionably a crime, and *I* ended up with a big premium increase and a blot on my no-claims record.

&gt;There was 5 minutes of swearing, I didnt just jump up straight away with the camera. The guy was just so impolite. 

He doesnt say he has a valid ticket. Again paraphrasing:
&gt;I've already shown you my fucking ticket. 

Thats the first thing we hear from the student in the video at the link, maybe not the original.

The kid was being a prick, you cant blame the conductor for getting frustrated with him and doing whatever he can to get the kid off and stop him holding up the rest of the train. Not the conductors fault a passenger took things into his own hands. (Conductor is an accurate job title by the way, no need for speech marks everywhere.)

You're being far too harsh on the conductor, he's just had a student swear at him and be impolite for around 5-10 minutes (according to the passenger filming) and then you say he was uncharitable and unsympathetic. Too right, I dont know many people who wouldn't feel the exact same way in that situation. 

As for the student getting his possessions back, the bag was thrown off the train. Was charging at the door and trying to barge his way back onto the train the most reasonable course of action?

Bottom line is he was only doing his job and got sweared at as a result, he could have handled it better but he didnt ask anyone else to get involved. This one incident doesnt mean he is incapable of doing the job.

The video only shows one minute of a supposedly 10 minute conversation.

I also refuse to accept the argument banded about this thread that, because the inspector asks someone to get off they should immediately comply.

true,whdevo,cnty-scotland,Bellshill,"""Maybe not the original""... then i would suggest that you go back to the ""original"" before pronouncing ...

But, that apart, I stand by my original opinion ... the ""conductor"" was trying to turn the other passengers against the boy (in itself, that was entirely inappropriate).

Again, i would state the opinion that there are procedures for situations such as this, and I feel that these ""procedures"" (one of which is to placate, rather than aggravate) were certainly not followed by the arrogant old man.

Given the fact that his ""duty"" (if you will) was to ""follow procedures"", and the fact that he did not, this, to me renders the ""conductor"" unfit for the position.

Any dealing with the public requires courtesy and diplomacy, and this was not evident here ...

The boy may very well have acted inappropriately (I do not deny, and never have denied, this), but this does not give anybody the right to physically assault him.

He was sworn at, but that having precipitated a situation of embarrassment and humiliation for the boy, and he most certainly did, in my opinion, even if ""by implication"" incite other passengers against the boy (and that is the most inappropriate way he could have handled the situation).

The ""conductor"" showed a lack of judgement, based on his own arrogance, and, again, in my opinion, actively precipitated a situation wherein an empty headed bully-boy felt that it was ok to assault another passenger.

Further, having witnessed this assault at close quarters, the old man did nothing to stop it (and it was his duty to have done so).

He is not, on many levels, fit for the job for which he accepts payment (""I don't care ... I'm getting paid"" more than once), and, if you watch the original video, you might agree with me that, at the train door, he also assaults the boy.

As to the boy's ""barging"", and, if you look at the original video, he could not have seen his bag thrown off the train, since, at the time, he was being manhandled.

Bottom line:  the bully-boy had no right to assault him, and the old man was derelict in his duty in his handling of the situation in the first place, for having failed to intervene in the assault, and for. at least as I saw it, for having laterally actively participated in the assault.

And, yes, when that ""one incident"" is so serious, it does, indeed, show that he was neither inclined to, nor capable of, doing his job.

true,Gettingbetter,eng-durham,Durham,"Edit: Mentioned politics. My bad.

I'm a US student, who had ambitions to come and work as a medieval archaeologist in the UK. Keep in mind, that was the major factor in why I originally decided to come and study here, and when I submitted my application back in 2009, it was a possibility. All I want to do is archaeology, and work with castles, cathedrals, and swords. It's not fighting cancer, and it's not building the newest iPad, or whatever glowing rectangle it is people are getting now, but it's exciting and stimulating, and it makes me happy. Getting a job as an archaeologist is difficult enough. I love what I do and I'm damn good at it.

~~The Tory government~~ has made that ambition all but impossible now, and even though I'm able to comfortably study here for the time being, at some point I'm going to have to leave. Unless I can prove to the UKBA and the British Academy that I'm one of the top 100 brilliant minds in my field, I cannot use my student visa for settlement. I could always marry some British girl, but I think my girlfriend back in the US might object. 

Moving to this country for my Master's has been one kick in the nuts after another, but that has more to do with the economic and political climate than British hospitality (I've made some amazing friends). Austerity measures are popular, even if they're poorly thought out (I'm projecting from my US background. I don't know how targeted the UK austerity measures were)

Worse yet, while this subreddit would hate to admit it, but there's a lot more people like the racist train woman than the British realize. The Polish come up in more conversations, and although some of my friends admit that they're doing what no one else will, I'm not confidant that the policy will change. I'm not confidant that the government is interested in seeing it change, thanks to the BNP and the Daily Mail.

By that I mean £7.50 is sufficient but if I also have to pay for expensive transport etc. as well, then it's not as I'd be making hardly anything. But generally it's just almost imposible to find work when you can only work for three months and can't drive.

Hardly. Every time a Eurozone country looked like it was about to pop, there was a great amount of hot air and not a lot of action. Even the agreement that Cameron vetoed is quite a lot of waffle - it's more like ""we need to agree to create an agreement"" rather than concrete actions.

I'm not sure why you think Cameron is stopping the Eurozone countries. They can form their own agreements to do whatever they want. They just can't use the EU institutions to do it - which makes sense when there are countries that don't use the Euro in the EU. Why should those non-Eurozone countries be subject to new rules and regulations when they aren't part of the problem?

&gt; Now we look like spoilt brats throwing our toys out of the pram to defend the City of London which helped sink our economy in an ocean of debt

As I said, they make a lot of money for the country. When the economy is doing as poorly as it is, and the government coffers are not flush with cash, you (if you're sane) are not going to make the situation worse by fucking over the industry that pays a lot in taxes and employs people who do the same.

If you're knee deep in debt, would your first course of action be to quit your job and remove your source of income?

Do you agree with these proposed taxes, that (since London is the financial powerhouse of Europe) disproportionately affect one country? Why should we help pay for the piss poor financial management of governments in other countries? 

That is after all the issue - it's not so much the banks, it is a few governments (Italy/Greece/Portugal/Ireland to some extent, etc) that thought the borrowing would never stop (and that is the issue for the UK too, thanks to Labour).

It is unfortunate that we are so reliant on the financial industry but that is where we are. Might as well try not to fuck that over too.

That comment piece seems quite light on sources and heavy on the waffle. The Guardian seem to be almost at the point of blowing a gasket  because the government aren't blindly pro-EU as they are.

We should be doing more to promote science, engineering and technology (and as evidenced by the sheer dumbing down of ""ICT"" in schools that doesn't suggest much is happening), sure, but to do it by penalising another industry seems wrong.

For one thing, the article doesn't appear to look at the knock on effects of the money the banks make. What do the employees of the finance industry spend their money on?

I must admit I'm not totally au fait with finance, but surely these are different issues? Forcing the banks to be less reckless when lending is a quite different issue to implementing highly damaging transaction taxes - particularly when the former makes sense and the latter is the desire of a vested interest (the Eurozone) trying to penalise one country (a non Eurozone country) and one of the few industries that country has that are actually competitive and world-leading. It isn't actually clear where the money raised from that tax would go - if it's going to go to the Eurozone (or indeed the EU) they should quite rightly go swivel.

This is not the kind of behavior you would see in the USA. People are much more focused on working for the good of the community - especially when disaster threatens.

On the A-levels the wikipedia page is pretty decent but here's the government site if you want:

http://www.direct.gov.uk/en/EducationAndLearning/QualificationsExplained/DG_10039018

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Advanced_Level_subjects

The good news is they do International A-levels, so if you look into it they will be available in Australia so there's no reason why you can't get cracking on it today if you wanted to:

http://www.cie.org.uk/qualifications/academic/uppersec/alevel

Technically you'll be a classed as a mature student because you're over 19 so instead of contacting the kiddy advice centre you'd use the government's NextStep advice centre.

http://www.direct.gov.uk/en/Dl1/Directories/DG_189718

Anything other than that and you're probably best emailing an adviser directly with any questions.

https://nextstep.direct.gov.uk/Contactus/emailanadviser/Pages/default.aspx

true,Axius,uk,United Kingdom,"Personally I think it's wrong on everyone involved's case. If the lad had a ticket going one way on the journey and the line he was on was the same journey in reverse, there's a good case for saying he HAD been given the wrong ticket.

His language was inexcusable, and the conducter was right for not serving him, but I feel holding up the train when there's a station at the destination which could have had transport police called to was an infinitely more appropriate response. The answer would have been to call ahead to have police there for fare evasion and violent behaviour or give the lad the benefit of the doubt. The confrontation wasn't necessary.

At no point should a third party have been involved, and in no way is it a 'good deed' to throw someone off a train without their belongings. Still, I can see why he did it, but it seems to me that the conductor had alternative options following the confrontation with the passenger. The whole affair could have been investigated without physical violence.

I'm sure there's a case for ""you should check your tickets before getting on"" but sometimes you assume that you got what you asked for. I once got a ticket for a coach up to Glasgow, I specifically asked for it to be on a date and the ticket I ended up being given was some random date. Since I'd only just finished work, I wanted to get home and since I'd been talking to the guy behind the counter about dates and times of departure, I had assumed it would be correct. I was charged nearly half the price of the ticket by the same guy who sold me the ticket the following morning as an 'alteration'.

Matt Smith's 11 is also a return to form in terms of a more alien Doctor; and in my personal opinion, his rendition is more fascinating. For the most part, he can do what Tennant's 10 can do *and more*. He also doesn't whine, play the victim or cling to his companions as much as his predecessor. After Tennant left, I honestly felt that void and thought that nobody could possibly top his reign.

This is most apparent in *Vincent and the Doctor* (widely considered to be the best of the series)

Rory and Amy are such an awesome duo and their story is quite refreshing after all the companions that seem to fall straight for the Doctor. Amy's adventures with the Doctor is displayed in series 5 as an old-fashioned fairy tale and it's amazing how it pays off in the end. 

What's also not mentioned enough is how solid the series is. Every episode is at least half-decent. There's none that one would be embarrassed to show (as opposed to, for example, episodes like *Fear Her* and *Daleks in Manhattan*) to outsiders. 

Finally, *The Pandorica Opens* has, probably, the best twist ending since the show's revival. To be honest, though, you haven't seen anything yet. Series 6 is a masterpiece. ",0,1323939185,null,0,false,0,c388vd4,t3_nd5x3,t1_c388vd4,t3_nd5x3,1428024902,7,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,7

true,SnappyCroissant,null,null,"I've been thinking about this too, And I'm more and more in favour of the Rory theory.

The Doctor hates himself, he isn't necessarily scared of himself, the general theme of fear is that it is created by the unknown. Himself, The Master, The Daleks, he's been dealing with them for a LONG LONG time now. He knows them, they don't scare him. They cause him to fear for the safety of others, and he constantly wrestles with himself.

So who then? Who is he scared of? I thinking he's scared of his past and the repercussions of them. And who is the one person who is subject to every whim of the Doctor, who suffers all the loss? It's Rory. Rory represents all the bad the Doctor has done and all the pain he causes and he just takes it, takes a constant beating. I think the Doctor is scared of him because of that. He's scared of this man who can take all the pain the Doctor dishes out, because one day he's going to be there waiting. the man who waited waiting for the Doctor.

I can see Steven Moffat killing Amy and The Doctor having to face Rory. And then after hunting him down across the universe, Rory would look at him. Tell him he didn't forgive him, and then walk away, doing exactly what the Doctor has done to so many villains before forcing them to live with their actions. And the Doctor would get hit so hard it would kill him. 

I wouldn't be surprised if 11 goes through suicide or some voluntary death. I think it would bring in an interesting dynamic for the 12th Doctor, a lighter and freer one but wary, one who didn't want to get involved in things or other people he'd be wounded and a little bit like a lost child and he'd have to have a firm companion who forced him into things. He'd probably spend a lot of time inventing and creating trying to make up for a lifetime of destruction. And I think he'd slowly develop into one of the more compassionate and balanced Doctors lots more adventuring and a touch less frantic fighting.

It would be a bit of a change of tone from 11's wildness.

Now do that and let me play the 12th Doctor damn it!

1. To the best of my knowledge, Restraint of Trade clauses are *very* difficult to enforce. Basically, your employer would need to be able to prove you were using 'inside information' or directly poaching his customers, or somesuch. He cannot just prevent you from working within the same industry. It is a restriction of free trade, and tends to not be legal (competition laws).

2. Pretty much the same as 1, although your employer has a slightly better case, as you are not just working within the same industry, but directly competing against his business, with knowledge you would have gained while working for him.

3. It is not uncommon for your notice period to increase depending on time of employment, seniority, etc, and perfectly legal. However, as with any length of notice period, they cannot legally stop you from leaving before the period is up. They *can* withhold monies owed to you, though, up to the equivalent of the salary you would have earned in that timescale.

Non-compete restrictions are a tricky subject. Breaching them is a civil matter so your former employer would have to take you to court. This means it's, hopefully, not something they're likely to do unless they really believe that what you're doing is hurting them.

In the court's eyes how enforceable the restriction is will come down to a few things, two of the most important are length of time and your position in the company.

As for length of time, 12 months is pretty much the upper limit.

Regarding your position. If the post room boy gets a job at a rival company the court will just tell the employer to get lost; however, if it's a senior manager who had access to confidential company information, future strategies and important client lists then it'll be a different matter and they may well decide the restriction is enforceable.

Personally I would be baffled as to why they would sell their 50m striker, but it would not surprise me either. Torres rides the bench too much. He should be producing now. I posted a couple of days ago about Torres and this whole thing leaves me wodnering if he regrets transferring. He was easily working his way to legend status at LFC, now he is relegated to playing 15 minutes per match at a club that is likely headed in the wrong direction.

Many will say Andy is riding the bench too much, but he is also 22 and needs to develop. He is a work in progress and just because he has a large price tag does not mean he needs to produce now.

As for Torres, if he truly regretted turning his back on the club I would take him back but it is hard to say.

If the building is an old one, then they might have an issue that the current elevator system is a legacy thing that you couldn't install today (isn't up to code, uninsurable etc), and that in order to install one that is you would have to extensively modify the building to accommodated it. If the cost of modifying an old building you know will have to be torn down sooner or later is quite high, then it is not economically viable to go to a great deal of expense, disruption and effort installing a new elevator. However, the rest of the building may well be OK for a few more years (you don't have to have elevators in apartment blocks after all), so it would simply be easier to relocate people who can't handle stairs to buildings which are fine. 

A recent example of this was the bridge at the station I use to get to my office, the old one was pretty much the original bridge put in when the station was built, and repaired over the years. Eventually that became uneconomical to repair so a new bridge was built a bit further down the station. However the new bridge is about 5 times bigger than the old one and would have been impossible to construct in the footprint of the old bridge, and this is due to building regulations being far stricter than they were a century ago. I would imagine that installing a modern elevator in the space left by a fairly old design would not be possible for similar reasons.

I can't really remember how he did in the Swedish U21 team, but if I recall the news reporting correct from that time, he was one of the better players. While he has performed well overall in the national team, and actually proved to be a slight difference in some games, I'm still a bit doubtful (or maybe I'm just plain jealous). I do not, alarmingly, remember him playing in the national team in some recent games. *Correction:* He has played in 5 of the last 6 games Sweden played (Euro qualifiers and friendlies). So, why don't I even remember seeing him on the pitch? Can't be a good sign.

He played in Kalmar FF before moving, and while I do not follow Swedish football I remember that they won the Swedish league (Allsvenskan) 2008. I also remember reading that one of the contributing factors to the win was that Kalmar FF utilised Elm's ability to do long throws - every long throw became like a free kick (much like in our last game against Stoke, remember?).

I'm not on par with what he's been doing or achieving in Holland though. I think he did good at first, but now he's been there 3 years (something) and I can't remember hearing much of him the last 2 years.

Sure, if we've signed him I won't cry over that fact. However I do feel that 7.5m Euro is a bit much, even though I guess he's a key player in AZ and I'm not too good at estimating these transfer figures.

If we buy Elm to sell Sandro later on, I do think we are getting the short end of the stick even if we gain financially. I'll compare it to buying Ashley Young to sell Bale, or something.",0,1323966914,null,0,false,0,c38b9zq,t3_ndud1,t1_c38b9zq,t1_c38aye5,1428026102,7,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,7

Cost does have to factor into it though. If the work required to install a new elevator is unreasonably expensive, or more than they can afford (we all know how hard credit is to secure these days), then it does have to come down to making a call based on the economic viability of fixing it.

    In an initial statement announcing his exit in March 2005, the BBC
    said the actor was afraid of being typecast and had found the series
    gruelling. 

    The corporation later accepted the statement was incorrect and that 
    it had not spoken to Eccleston before releasing it. 

    ""They handled it very badly but they issued an apology and I
     dropped it,"" he added.

Of course, I haven't tried to suggest otherwise. But having something in their building that is prohibitively expensive to repair shouldn't abrogate them from their responsibility to the residents. What if it was something other than the lift they deemed too expensive to repair, like dangerous electrical wiring for example? Would they be able to just tell residents, *""Sorry, we've had to turn off the electricity because it's dangerous and repairing it isn't economically viable!""*? 

I guess it boils down to whether the lift in this particular block of flats is considered ""essential"" or not. If the building has more than three floors and there are *any* residents that rely on the lift to get in and out, then I would say it is. They should therefore be duty bound to re-house anyone who needs it in commensurate accommodation.

As for ascertaining whose responsibility it is: well the company cited in the article are the ones making half-hearted apologies, so I don't think it's unreasonable to assume it's them.

Having said that, Tesco often have real bargains on their whiskies so you can often pick up a much better whisky for a couple of quid more than Glenfiddich.

It's all down to personal taste really, you'll get to know which ones you like. If you see single malts on in a pub try one you haven't had before. Scotch can be addictive like that... not in the sense of alcohol abuse but more like pokemon!

true,Ivashkin,null,null,"&gt; Of course, I haven't tried to suggest otherwise. But having something in their building that is prohibitively expensive to repair shouldn't abrogate them from their responsibility to the residents. What if it was something other than the lift they deemed too expensive to repair, like dangerous electrical wiring for example? Would they be able to just tell residents, ""Sorry, we've had to turn off the electricity because it's dangerous and repairing it isn't economically viable!""? 
&gt;
&gt; I guess it boils down to whether the lift in this particular block of flats is considered ""essential"" or not. If the building has more than three floors and there are any residents that rely on the lift to get in and out, then I would say it is. They should therefore be duty bound to re-house anyone who needs it in commensurate accommodation.

The lack of details is an issue. It doesn't make it clear if this elevator is simply from a company that went broke, no one makes the parts and there is only so much dumpster diving for parts the insurance company will take, and that they're going to put one in to replace it eventually. Or if it was an old building where a new elevator that meets all the legal requirements would be  very expensive and/or require renovating the building in such a way that would render it unoccupiable while the work is done. Just that the lift in the building couldn't be repaired in a way that would make their insurers happy with it. 

Wiring is different, because they do have to provide electricity legally, although if it was in such bad repair that they couldn't get insurance then they would probably have to evict and rehouse everyone anyway while it was repaired. An interesting parallel would be my fathers old boiler though. It was his, as was his house, but covered by some form of service plan from British Gas. But despite this when he reported a fault with the way it burned he was told that an engineer was going to be sent over to cut off his gas, and that if he wasn't in they would force entry. So in this case, his gas supplier cut off his supply of gas because his boiler was beyond the point of economical repair, somehow dangerous and refused to reconnect him until it was replaced. 

With regard to the lift being essential or not, it's more of a legal matter than anything else. These buildings don't have to have working elevators legally. So a private landlord or building owner could refuse to repair or replace them on the grounds of cost and the only issue would be over the service charge after a service has been withdrawn, and the services and assistance they volunteered to those in need. However, a social housing landlord would just have a legal responsibility to ensure that a disabled person is in suitable housing, which would involve moving the person (in this case into a sheltered scheme) rather than paying for a new elevator to be built.  

&gt; As for ascertaining whose responsibility it is: well the company cited in the article are the ones making half-hearted apologies, so I don't think it's unreasonable to assume it's them. I haven't personally sent them any hate mail – and I'd question whether the strongly worded email silencia sent them could be categorized as such – but I hope they take any adverse public reaction as a kick up the backside to address the situation urgently.

Oh come on. Everyone does that. They have to apologize in a way which legally doesn't damage their case in any potential future legal action, using bland corporate language designed not to give any details away. If you've ever had a job where a suit is a requirement you'll have noticed it's use all the time. This is how an email about a file server not rebooting properly turns into 4 pages of text which covers areas such as ""caring"", ""commitment"", ""values"" and ""service excellence"", yet doesn't actually mention a failed PERC battery.

Him: what can you see madam

Me: it's just starting up, I can see the Ubuntu splash screen

several minutes later...

Him: Madam, I just need you to push the windows key and R

Me: You mean the super key

Him:The windows key

Me: we always call it the super key, do you mean the one with a penguin on (note we don't have a keyboard with a penguin on this was artistic license) 

Him: The windows key and R please madam

Me: do you know a lot about computers

Him: yes madam, please press the windows key and R

Me: (becoming bored) Look, I'm giving you not so subtle clues that I'm running a linux machine.  I'm not going to fall for this scam

At this point the bloke rather that giving up reverts to the beginning of his script and wastes maybe another 10 mins of his life.  I explicitly tell him that I know it's a scam and he's preying on elderly and not very bright people and should find a better job.  Still he persists.  Eventually I just stop talking.  After two or three minutes he hangs up.

About 30 seconds later, the fucker rings back!  Same bloke.  I let boyfriend pick up.  Boyfriend is less patient (or less willing to give his own time to wind people up) than me, he only manages to play along for 10 mins before he snaps and tells the bloke he knows exactly what the bloke is trying to do and that he (boyfriend) is a computer security specialist, that he's going to call the police's cyber crime unit and the next time they ring we'll be able to key in a code that patches the call through to said cyber crime unit who will be able to trace it and alert the Indian authorities.

true,widgetas,null,null,"""Offence"" - But why? Personally I really don't like the O word and try not to use it, but what is there really to object to in an ""That's offensive"" way here?
What did Smith say exactly? This, [(recovered from Peter Tatchell's blog)](http://www.petertatchell.net/religion/christian-manager-wrongly-demoted-over-homophobic-facebook-comments.htm):

&gt; “an equality too far.....the bible is quite specific that marriage is for men and women if the state wants to offer civil marriage to same sex then that is up to the state; but they shouldn’t impose its rules on places of faith and conscience.”

It is quite clear that he is objecting to the possibility of any and all churches being forced to conduct same sex marriages and he bases this on certain biblical passages. There are portions of the bible that are homophobic and are quite clear that gays are 'wrong'. Of course most people don't use the bible as there moral compass any more, but there are people who still do. We can, of course, say that these people are misguided and point to other passages the contradict them and show they are wrong. But you can do this with almost any issue.

Smith is failing to appreciate that there are many gay Christians who, obviously, do not read or accept the anti-gay passages in the same way he does. Or they take other parts of the bible as being more important. It would appear he doesn't think anyone who's gay can be Christian. As an outsider I can understand his thinking, as to me it is quite clear that there are aspects of the bible that preach against homosexuality. But as an outsider I can also see that every believer ignores some areas of their holy text while accepting others. They have to.

However, what Smith has said with regards to same sex marriage can be applied just as easily to mixed race marriage. There are passages in the bible that can be interpreted as saying that interracial marriage is wrong. So Smith could quite as easily have said what he did about the state imposing their rules on the church in that case too. I'm sure that many people made this point, particularly in America, when there was still a good deal of racial tension.

But even in that case, I do not think that Smith should have been chastised in the way he has. He hasn't actually discriminated against anyone, but merely voiced his opinion in private, to a degree about his interpretation of his holy text. There was no way this could have been turned into a criminal investigation, even if he had said it in public. He didn't say anything homophobic, I think.",0,1323998014,null,0,false,0,c38gj7y,t3_ndqkn,t1_c38gj7y,t1_c38aysi,1428028644,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

From my dream diary...

Dreamed about Davros and the Doctor. Two men were going to leave the people of a devastated city to die. Pan 360 around destroyed building. Shattered windows and decadent surroundings. It’s almost like  the building is the only thing there. All around it are wrecked debris and it’s like the place hasn’t been lived in for decades or centuries. Picture the building from the day after tomorrow. But Davros can use the computer system to save people.

They can digitally “capture” a persona and store the data. Davros would use this to save everyone but the two men blackmail Davros and the Doctor is doing his usual “WOT?!”.

Davros mentions Shan. The two men make fun of her. Davros is leaning to the left over the counter of our house between the tv and dining room which is also my school hallway. His chair adjacent the counter facing the kitchen. Dream logic: he uses his right hand. He is using his lighting on one of the men saying, “You don’t know Shan!”

You are correct Galloway has a long political history which from what I can ascertain is primarily focused upon Britains relationship with the middle east.

He was also hauled I front of the US congress once and left unscathed. However, apart from big brother in recent years he is primarily defined by his stance on the Iraq war, an extension of his keystone beliefs.

There are serious YA books that deal with self-harm and drug abuse, those are real things. So are break-ups and they can affect someone deeply.

It should not be portrayed as a positive thing, as something to emulate, but it's certainly reasonable. 

The issue then is not that she acted as she did, but perhaps that it was portrayed as something positive. I've not read the books, but I believe that instead of talking about it she instead puts herself into dangerous situations- again, something that is a possibility, but I don't believe anyone told her off for it.
