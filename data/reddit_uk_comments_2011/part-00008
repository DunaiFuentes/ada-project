As a recent Who convert, have you seen anything the doctor's worn before Tennant? What he (and Eccleston's Doctor) wore is comparatively tame to what previous doctor's wore. In fact, the old professor look that 11 has is nothing compared to Six's [rainbow themed... clothing.](http://imgur.com/DpGkH ""RAINBOW MADNESS! awww yeah"")

&gt;Am I just being weird in thinking that his apparel is a bit...dated(?).

A little bit. Have you seen anything the third doctor [wore?](http://imgur.com/Eubyi ""like a boss"") I mean, I love Pertwee, but that's about as archaic as you get.

&gt;To me it kind of looks like they found some dated professors outfit and decided to stick it on him, I dunno.

I'm not entirely sure what you mean by this, but in case you were wondering (you probably weren't, but I love story time), it was actually Smith who came up with the outfit, he might have actually owned the jacket and braces if I remember correctly (originally I think they had something... pirate-y in mind)

true,abw,cnty-uk,Surrey,"We're looking to move house at the moment.  We live in a modest 3 bedroom house and our younger child is outgrowing the room he's in (quite literally - he's in a cot bed because the room isn't big enough for a full size bed and his feet are touching the end).  We bought our house 15 years ago for Â£135k, if memory serves.  We've worked hard that time and put all our spare money into paying off the mortgage rather than taking lavish holidays or buying new cars, etc.  So compared to most, we're in a very fortunate position - we own most of our own house and don't have a large mortgage.

The problem is that we live in Guildford among all the stock brokers, bankers, and other rich folk who ""nip into the city"" to work.  The average price *difference* between a 3 bedroom semi and a 4 bedroom detached house (the next step up the ladder, so to speak) is Â£236,000.  That's a *quarter of a million pounds* to gain one bedroom.  Does anyone else here think that nearly three quarters of a million pounds to buy a basic 4 bedroom family house is just insane?  Oh, and let's not forget that a Â£700k house incurs Â£28k in stamp duty and about Â£12k in estate agents fees.  With legal fees, surveys, removals, etc. the cost of moving is getting on for Â£50k before we've even paid for a larger house.

Of course, our current house is worth loads of money which sounds great on paper.  But there's no way I'm taking on an extra Â£300k mortgage to get an extra bedroom.  So we're stuck in a slightly-too-small and vastly-over-valued house.

I think it unlikely that the house prices in places like Guildford will ever fall by 20%.  Demand is too high and supply too low.  I really can't complain because we've got a house to live in and it's in a nice area.  But we're absolutely stuck fast on the housing ladder along with millions of other people around the country.  We can't afford to move house so we're not freeing up our property for second time buyers, so they're not freeing up their properties for first time buyers.  And besides, if my wife and I wanted to buy our current house now there's absolutely no way we could afford it anyway.  Nice houses are luxuries reserved for the filthy rich around here, but the knock-on effects everyone.

I can only conclude that our housing market is completely and utterly fuckoed.  I'm going to go live in a tree.

true,benfitzg,null,null,"Hi - the answer to this depends on which variables you plug into the formula, and these are subjective. Firstly in this environment investing is not for returns but to loose less money than you would in a savings account. So we are looking for the least worst option.

If you think prices will fall 10% or more in a year then on a 200K house you are loosing 20K. Plus the amount you are paying down on a 90% mortgage is mostly interest, not the loan itself. eg 200K house, 180K mortgage at Halifax as a FTB, so 10% deposit of 20K. 6.34% rate. Here is the [cost](http://www.mortgages-online.co.uk/Mortgage_Calculators/mortgage_repayments_calculator.aspx?value=20000&amp;loan=180000&amp;rate=6.34&amp;years=25&amp;months=&amp;Button1=Calculate&amp;inflationperiod=&amp;mtype=0&amp;inflation=0). 1,197 quid a month. Interest only is 951. So 246 pounds is paying down the house itself. 951 is just interest. I reckon you could rent at far less than 951 for a 200k house in most places. Add in the fact that if prices fall 10% you will loose your entire deposit. Any more and you are in negative equity.

Of course if house prices go up then you are all good, and you don't need to calculate any of the above, pay down a pension or live within your means. You can go on holiday twice a year even though your job is average and have a big car and a big TV. You can do this until your entire country runs out of money.

So, IMHO, if you think prices will drop, buying a house for a FTB is a bad option. Time will tell if I'm right.

The reason why interest rates are higher on lower deposit rates is that all the banks know prices are going to drop and they don't want to get caught holding a loan to an asset that they may have to repossess and not realise the ""value"" on it and so loose money. If you have 25% deposit, as that kind of fall is less likely, they are quite happy for you to loose your own equity.

Ultimately I think it will revert. FTBs feed the system. If they are not entering the market it's like a sausage machine. You stop feeding in meat but for a while when you turn the handle, sausages keep coming out. Then they don't.

The seeds of the crisis were sown under Labour and before them, I'm afraid. When you build a ponzi scheme (backed by insane lending on houses, just like US sub-prime) it's all ok until it [isn't](http://www.bolgernow.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/bernie-prison-bitch.jpg). Because it's confidence based. We had over 10 years of people spending beyond their means, as this graph clearing illustrates.

I think the important thing to take away from this is not partisan points like if Thatcher started the housing obsession or Labour's poor regulation of banking (although you'd have to be a moron to think it was sustainable), but that Britain needs to stop profiting from debt on paper assets and move to a sustainable future. This future would **not** include loads of PFI that manages perception but not reality.

As per that graph, debt was building up all under Labour's term. It was seen as profit because people believed housing would rise forever. This was dumb. But just because someone has only seen the elephant in the room right before it takes a huge shit doesn't mean it hasn't been there for some time.

We now have a massive deficit because people have lost confidence in the ponzi that is housing and have stopped borrowing against their children's future. This is a good thing as it's not sustainable. Labour did a lot of borrowing that didn't show up on the figures, by PFI and getting people to borrow due to lax credit regulation. That is **not** growth.

What it does put into perspective is how irrelevant the Conservative's simplistic arguments about Labour overspending are. The big figure that dwarfs anything else is the Â£850 billion or so which we had to put on the balance sheet to stabilise the banking system, the real scapegoat for the crisis lies here and not in anything to do with spending. 

Likewise the Conservatives are playing a very clever game, which in a way you have to respect them for.

true,Talonwhal,null,null,"&gt; Circadian rhythms are a reality though

This is irrelevant to the whole timezone argument.

In case you misunderstood me, I'm not saying people should be working in the middle of the night - I'm more saying people should do everything in sync with sunrise and sunset in fact - regardless or the time it says on your clock. Of course it helps to put things into neat little slots for various purposes, but whatever... kinda irrelevant what people decide to do with regards to that.

&gt; as is a need to have accurate time keeping which is useful for many things.

But the only timekeeping point that holds is that people might get confused if they work from 9-5 half the year and 8-4 for the other half and it could cause some administrative problems. However there are already masses of problems caused by daylight and timezones that would all be gone.

Also, there's added benefits here: We can shift the time we work in smaller intervals - eg. 5 or 10 or 15 minutes each time - without screwing with our circadian rhythm as it adjusts to smaller changes fine. With our current mindset this would mean changing the clocks 10 times a year, which is ridiculous of course - as is changing them for daylight time at all.

&gt; If we forgo timezones then which timezone do we use globally?

UTC I guess, might as well use it seeing as we already have a universal time standard.

&gt; So I would keep time zones, but we could do with loosening up the 9-17 thing, especially when we have problems with peak traffic as everyone tries to be at work for 0900.

If we're going to change the times that people do things to solve congestion problems, then why do we need daylight savings or timezones? All we need to do is do stuff when it's light, regardless of where you are.. if the sun comes up at 11pm, then that's when you get up for work.. it's not very complicated, but people have a very strange sense of what different times mean ingrained in their heads.

Since I deal with Europeans a fair amount having the same timezone as them would be quite convenient actually. On the other hand my working hours are driven by events that happen on the continent so if we changed our timezone like this I'd actually have to work an hour longer every day which would be pretty depressing. Also, personally I get to work in the dark and go home in the dark for most of the winter and I don't think this change will affect that at all.

The results have been poor in this part of the season and instead of breaking records in a positive way, we are performing like the Chelsea from pre-abramovich days, so what can be done?

I think the rumours pointing us towards Arsenals Chief Scout to replace Arnesan is good news as we cannot keep the turnover of players we have had in recent years, the squad needs an overhaul, but Abramovich must realise if it's a period of transition that we must allow a manager to have time in order for this too happen and during that time he must be given the resource to do the job.

Persoannly there are two managers I would like to see back at the club, one is likely, one is highly unlikely; Mourinho or Hiddink.

They spend Â£5 million quid over 5 years on 4 billion rubber bands.  Or a million quid a year for 800 million rubber bands.  That's 1/8p per band.

Let's say a single rubber band holds together 10 letters on average.  That's Â£4 worth of postage stamps, for which Postman Pat has a rubber band overhead of 1/8p.  That's, uhm, about 0.03% overhead.  Pretty good.

And let's look at the litter problem.  13,000 discarded bands founds from the 800 million used in a year.  That's a tiny, tiny fraction of a percentage.  Not bad at all.

I don't know how many people reading this are familiar with the website [TVShowsOnDVD.com](http://www.tvshowsondvd.com/) (we've been around almost ten years; TV Guide bought us a few years ago), but I'm the ""news guy"" there (the entire staff has always consisted of just the site's founder, Gord, and myself...and FWIW, Gord's Canadian and I'm in the U.S.).  So I've had to figure out this season/series/program(me) thing as it relates to British shows a number of years ago, and I guess I've got it fairly right, or else everybody's being overly polite about it because nobody complains. Plus I had the benefit of liking British shows all along, as I've seen them on PBS since my childhood (including all too little Who). And my friend Wesley in Somerset, a close follower of the site and what I post there, has never tried to straighten me out.  :)

The BBC's releases of DVDs in North America (Region 1) have been fairly inconsistant about using the word ""series"", but they did use that term on many shows such as Red Dwarf or Are You Being Served?; other studios releasing DVDs in USA/Canada (such as Acorn with Pie In The Sky and their upcoming Upstairs, Downstairs sets, or BFS with Wycliffe or The F Word) have also used the word ""Series"" instead of ""Season"" on the DVD box.

On the other hand things have gotten more confusing as they try to ""Americanize"" the word choices in the DVD titles, and it's not even a recent thing.  Back in 2001-2002, A&amp;E put out the original '70s Upstairs, Dowstairs program(me) on DVD in Region 1, and they called them ""The Complete 1st Season"" through ""The Complete 5th Season"", trying to make it sound familiar to folks on the left side of the pond.  But Acorn's upcoming new releases of the show, in a ""40th Anniversary Collection"", refer to individual production years as ""Series 1"" and ""Series 2"", etc.  But to top it all off, the box set with all five production years is called ""The Complete Series"".  :/

But here's the confusing thing that every North American-based fan of Doctor Who and its spin-offs should be able to sympathize with me on.  When I walk over to my shelf and look at the BBC/Warner releases of Doctor Who (2005 version), I see spines that say ""The Complete 1st Series"" through ""The Complete 5th Series"".  Right?  But when I look at spines for the DVD boxes of Torchwood and Sarah Jane Adventures, they say ""The Complete 1st SEASON"", ""The Complete 2nd SEASON"", etc.  

So, the word ""series"" is very inconsistantly used with Region 1 DVD (and Region A Blu-ray) releases, and it drives us Americans a bit loopy.  Not that we're not already loopy anyway, but this isn't helping things.  ;)",0,1298287785,null,0,true,0,c1hnyl3,t3_fpa7p,t1_c1hnyl3,t1_c1hn87w,1426932545,4,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,4

true,Talonwhal,null,null,"There are problems, but first of all your personal experience of timezones actually inversely helps your argument here...

Yes, you (and I) am used to working  with people across various timezones - I have been communicating across the internet with people all over the world for about 15 years now. I'm also pretty good at math, and I can easily account for timezone changes on the fly. It's never a *problem* for me, as such.

Unfortunately this isn't true for the *majority* of people. The number of times I've had to explain why the times on an airline ticket are like they are, etc.

Also in the US they have to write 2-3 times for TV shows, etc. due to differing timezones.

As another commenter noted, America causes problems twice a year too, but as the world grows smaller with the internet and global travel timezones for rail timetables, conferences, confuse a lot of people (along with daylight time changes) even though *they have lived with this system their entire lives*. It's simply not intuitive or easy to get to grips to for most people.

Guess what? China spans FIVE timezones and they have ONE time. They manage just fine - it's actually way more efficient and causes no problems, as opposed to some/many that are experienced elsewhere. A shining example to the world... at least when it comes to timekeeping.

And with regards to daylight changes: How about the thousands of people who turn up to work early or late twice a year because they didn't change their non-digital clock for daylight time. Again, it's been the same their entire lives but it still causes problems for the current generation. My clocks change themselves too - maybe this problem will go away, but daylight time is unecessarily disputive anyway as I noted before we could do this with smaller changes and cause no problems or circadian disruptions, while still adjusting for the time we have where it's light.

And now.. what's with this bullshit about the UK moving timezones? Stuff like this will keep on happening for decades to come and it always causes massive argument and dispution. We've doen this enough times before and we still can't agree on it...

There's one sensible way to do things when looking ahead into the future. As I said, if everyone adopted UTC, there would be some disruption and confusion, sure. But as with all changes of this type, 1 generation is all it takes and then it's ""normal"" and people will remember the old times in a sort of ""wow, how silly was that"" sort of way. Like we do with pre-metric (US excluded :P)

And the bonus is that this will be fine for decades, centuries, millenia, with no disruption to the system in the forseeable future - instead of what we have now where Russia is abolishing daylight time, the UK is thinking of changing it's timezone, and generally no one can decide on anything and change it every few decades.

You're right that non of this is achievable without relevant training. This is why education is being reformed to be flexible and demand driven. Free schools are supposed to figure out the skills needed, and offer them to communities. Universities are being forced to demonstrate their value and relevance to students.

What they have done is built a compelling narrative that most people seem to swallow.

The banking bailout will not correct itself. The only way it could possibly do so would be through hyperinflation and we'd all be pushing wheelbarrows full of money to the supermarket. So instead of hyperinflation, we get qualntitive easing, which is the slow and steady devaluation of our currency. 

In a global economy, that means things are only going to get more expensive.

&gt; Since most people don't have a grasp of macro economics they simply don't understand that it's a completely different ball game.

That's true to a certain extent, but the basics are the same although it's more like running a business. Someone borrows, someone lends - if the lender thinks that the borrower might not repay, he calls in all debts and refuses to lend any more.

That's not a complicated situation.

Now consider that same situation but the borrower is a Government. A Governments income is purely dependent on taxation. If the economy is set to decline - perfectly feasible since our biggest trading partner is also in dire straights - then the lender is less inclined to lend. Therefore the Government must reduce expenditure.

Should that entail cutting public services when we're fighting two very costly wars? Probably not, but that's a different argument.

&gt; Which is where we get to your Ponzi Scheme argument, to a certain extent the entire economy is like a ponzi scheme in that it doesn't work unless there is over supply of money. 

What the hell are you talking about? There was no oversupply of money - there was an excess of credit, which has far outstripped its matchable value in currency. Again, hence the quantitive easing.

This should never have happened and if proper regulation had been in place then there would have been no 'ponzi scheme economy'.

&gt; The housing market, like all markets are used as levers by the BofE to ensure that perfect balance between supply and demand so yes there was a housing bubble but we get through bubbles all the time, even in good economic times.

No we do not. Bubbles are very bad developments usually caused by speculation by people who do not know the true value of a thing, who are then taken advantage of by people who do.

&gt; The problem was lack of regulation or rather a lack of understanding in government about why regulation was needed in the new part of the banking industry that operated outside traditional banking regulation.

Here we are in agreement, and it's obvious to me that neither party would have done anything differently as the offer of free money is too much to resist.

&gt; In the long term this will be seen as a hiccup, we'll have a period of high inflation now which will hit us all short term - that is over the next three years - but this will start to erode the value of debt and within 6 years or so, that graph will be back to historic levels, 2008 - 2011 will be seen as an almighty aberration.

It won't, because that system of banking is done. Done and finished, and it's never coming back. China won't have it, India won't have it, Brazil won't have it, Russia won't have it, most of Europe won't have it, and the days when the USA could command them to take it are passed.

&gt; What it should leave as a permanent reminder is the importance of having economically literate people in government alongside good advisers, independent from the industry, and most of all of good regulation.

The statistics you provide have a plethora of averages; 3.5 doctors in France and Germany per 1,000 vs 2.5 in the UK. So, given the article is in 2009, let's get some GDP statistics... taken from [here](http://www.google.com/publicdata?ds=wb-wdi&amp;met=ny_gdp_mktp_cd&amp;idim=country:GBR&amp;dl=en&amp;hl=en&amp;q=united+kingdom+gdp+statistics#met=ny_gdp_mktp_cd&amp;idim=country:GBR:FRA:DEU)

Okay, so in 2009, the UK GDP was supposedly $2.175 trillion, against France's $2.649 trillion and Germany's $3.347 trillion. That means we spent somewhere about $182.7 billion in 2009, against France's $291.39 billion and Germany's $348.088 billion. As the article states, this makes it ""one of the cheapest health care systems in Europe"".

We spend nearly half as much as those two countries and have almost an equal number of doctors per person. Using population statistics from [here](http://www.google.com/publicdata?ds=wb-wdi&amp;met=sp_pop_totl&amp;idim=country:FRA&amp;dl=en&amp;hl=en&amp;q=population+of+france#met=sp_pop_totl&amp;idim=country:FRA:GBR:DEU) one can see that in terms of population to number of doctors in 2009, France and the UK have roughly the same population; France had a population of 26 million and the UK had 25 million. Germany had roughly 82 million people. In proportion to expenditure then, France pays 1.5x what we pay for our health service in order to get an extra doctor per 1,000 people. If we blow the averages up, that's roughly 91,000 doctors in France, 287,000 in Germany and 62,500 in the UK.

I only have figures for life expectancy in 2008 from the same source [here](http://www.google.com/publicdata?ds=wb-wdi&amp;met=sp_dyn_le00_in&amp;idim=country:GBR&amp;dl=en&amp;hl=en&amp;q=life+expectancy#met=sp_dyn_le00_in&amp;idim=country:GBR:FRA:DEU) but it is doubtful they will have strayed too far. The implication is that you can use this statistic to assess the quality of health at a fundamental level. France in 2008 had an average life expectancy of 81.5, Germany had 80.1 and the UK had 79.9.

All the evidence indicates to me that continental healthcare at least in France is relatively inefficient in terms of costs but provides slightly better long-term care. However, the NHS offers good value for money, costing roughly 63% of what France spends on their healthcare, and is almost as efficient despite having less doctors across the same population.

I cannot say the article you linked proves UK healthcare is inferior; if anything it simply implies an inefficiency due to having 1 less doctor per 1000 and people in France and Germany visit the doctor more often.",0,1298312356,null,0,false,0,c1hp8cg,t3_fpexi,t1_c1hp8cg,t1_c1hom8u,1426933144,4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,4

And many state schools perform better than independent schools - especially the top performing ones and the few selective grammars that still exist (as these are less affected by poverty as mostly only educate the middle class that get tuition for the 11 plus etc.)

I just don't see any argument as to why privatising the whole education sector would help solve any of these problems? Besides the middling independent schools tend to charge around 3k a term, so that's already 1.5x as much as the state schools get, and Eton etc. charge 20k a year which is far far more.

Grammar schools may get less but they also get to choose their students and ultimately the other kids (which are the MAJORITY, only ~30% ever get into grammars) still have to be educated and leaving them in glorified holding cells in secondary moderns is hardly a good use of potential.

true,Talonwhal,null,null,"&gt; people want a time cycle that follows the local daylight patterns

I still don't understand this point at all... Any 24 hour cycle follows the daylight patterns as much as any other regardless of when it starts and ends. We already ""reset"" our time at a completely arbitrary point... every day at some point early in the night time (""midnight"").

So what's the problem with waking up at 0200 every day and going to bed at 1900? You do realise that if it had been like that your whole life, then you'd be here telling me right now that getting up at 0700 seems completely ridiculous, right? It is completely arbitrary - so much in fact that different time systems have existed around the world. Eg. look into traditional Japanese and Thai systems. Now, *they* follow the daylight patterns. What we have doesn't really. There's nothing particularly natural or human about the way we do it now, it's just what you're used to.

&gt; they seem to work OK

So would a thousand other really bad ideas if it came to it - there's simply no logic behind them existing. And why would any country not like using a global timezone? It's like some insane mentality that that would mean they're using ""our time"" instead of their own or something even though they're already doing everything at completely arbitrary numbers throughout the day - it's complete nonsense.

If you think about it like this:

If everyone used UTC, it wouldn't be any different for us and everyone else - we do things at random times depending on our sunrise and sunset. So do they. We get up at 0700, someone gets up at 0100, someone else at 1800 --- none of those are ""normal"", they're all as arbitrary as each other. China's timezones only persist out of stubborness, there would be no innate desire to change a world where everyone used UTC.

But there is still this:

&gt; annoying billions of people will be worth it

And with regards to annoying billions of people - I do like the sound of that :)

But I guess I can only repeat my previous argument... being a very forward looking person, I see it as disrupting 7 billion people now, or disrupting trillions of people over the next few thousands of years.

Try Googling ""timezone problems"".

Google failed, apple failed, microsoft failed... people will keep screwing up, getting confused by, mis-programming and generally wasting tens or hundreds of thousands of hours of work every year because of them.

It's 2011 and people are still getting it wrong every single day - the problems aren't going away while we keep this ridiculous system.

I'm a programmer and I am well versed in the problems caused. The entire timezone file system is basically just a big hack to make sure everything goes smoothly (and gets updated as countries change their timezones) - except that it doesn't always go smoothly. Timezone selection often confuses users, and timezones detected autmatically are often incorrect. If you don't register or otherwise select a timezone on every single website you visit, the times will probably not be in your timezone.

Do you know all the 30+ timezones in case you see a time with the letters next to it on a random website? If you do, you're the massive exception.

Thousands of mistakes will be made tomorrow due to timezones. And every day in the decades following.

Hundreds of applications will be written this year which do not handle timezones properly. Even though the functionality in many languages has been in place for decades, it seems that people are never going to quite get it right or properly support it in a vast number of cases.

Timezones are just another legacy system of an old world that we no longer have any use for, and as long as we keep them they will continue to confuse, cause errors and generally waste time (perhaps ironically).

The big thing at the moment is [Germany must choose EMU fusion or fission](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/comment/ambroseevans_pritchard/8336841/Germany-must-choose-EMU-fusion-or-fission.html) - however it's not just Germany .

The big problem is one of responsibility . If different countries are to have the responsibility of managing their own economies then they have to have their own economic systems including their own currencies . What has been produced with the Euro is a common currency with different operating conditions in the various states . This means that states such as the PIGS have a massive problem of moral hazard type - they can act very irresponsibly but not be held to account . Greece is by far the worst offender . If Greece still had the Drachma it could be far more closely held responsible .

Ok. - so what we have is the passing up of taxation , which is **our** money , to controlling and managing authorities who spend it as if it is 'their' money and spend it in a way that they see fit - not necessarily the way we would spend it . There is massive disconnect and a very patronising relationship .

The whole concept of the present EU was one that moved from the bottom up trading states of the EEC to a top down monolithic state of the EU . This is where , in my opinion , it went very wrong .

It's a one size fits all concept and clearly one size doesn't fit all . Also diversity is very important - it's what propels progress .

There is no reason why the basic principles of the EEC \ EU can't be implemented in a diverse bottom up manner - ie. returning control to the nation states and the people . For example - individual countries could each have their own currencies with trading against a common Euro currency without any margin being charged in the trade - just a conversion ratio . We effectively have that at the moment where the conversion rate is just 1:1 . As such if you return the responsibility and control to the individual countries they can then sort out their own messes .

For the economy and for many other reasons of national divergencies and national characters sovereignty is important . Just look at the bun fight going on over Julian Assange at the moment .

If a country has full sovereignty then it's people can hold it to account . The more the sovereignty is handed over to the EU the less that the people can hold it to account . And they certainly can't hold the EU to account . The larger the nation state the less the power of the individual vote .

As far as identity is concerned - I would much rather have many different individual identities than one bland Euro identity . This would be far more enriching .

true,bowling4meth,english,Straight out of Surrey,"Perhaps this question is better asked in /r/ukpolitics. I see a lot of things posted to /r/unitedkingdom (possibly because of the bigger readership) that really do belong there, and I think you'd get more responses from people that have a better understanding of the EU, Europe and all that jazz, so to speak.

I've dealt with the various incarnations of the EU and EC going back to before Maastricht. In fact I remember the 1975 referendum. We were not voting on whether or not we wanted to be part of a monolithic superstate, we were effectively voting on continued membership of the common market. Over the years I've noticed some big positives from Europe, and some major negatives.

We are the third biggest net provider of funding to Europe. Whatever anyone tells you, we put in more than we get out and by a long way.

We're also now in the situation where the ultimate power over the UK falls to the European Council, thanks to the Lisbon treaty. The EC is largely unaccountable. When Greece and Ireland imploded, the EC talked of using Lisbon to force countries to agree to a single central monetary policy - something that had been said would never happen (as that wasn't the purpose of Lisbon to centralise power, or so we were told - not that it mattered because we never got a vote on it).

Because we're not in the Euro, if it's hand is forced the pound will be screwed over in any way possible to protect the Euro. This is the self interest of the majority. You could argue that it's common sense for the majority in the Euro to do this - they do the same to other European countries without the Euro.

Accountability, this is the real big one. If you MEP does sod all, it doesn't matter. There's no punishment, no accountability. There's a huge amount of potential fraud going on. When [Marta Andreasen](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marta_Andreasen) was hired as Chief accountant in 2002 she uncovered massive problems with the accounting system that could be abused to lead to serious fraud. Instead of ordering an inquiry, identifying any actual misuse and taking action, the European Council fired her instead, and rejected her findings.

Positives - Data Protection Act (from the EU Privacy Directive) - great move. Some of the health and safety laws and environmental laws have been very good as well - but bear in mind that it should be our job to push for the creation of these types of laws, not to rely on a benevolent unaccountable committee to force these upon us.

I would have to say that I support the idea of a Europe with free trade, the idea of a single currency is tempting but I think economically speaking the countries are all too different (what does Germany's economy have in common with Greece other than the Euro for example?). My biggest concern is accountability and transparency, we just don't have it at the European level. I think we have to draw a line somewhere though - to try and federalise Europe like Germany or America is to try and deny to ourselves that less than 20 years ago member and candidate states were killing each other. The Cyprus question, for example needs to be resolved before the rest of Europe can properly integrate, otherwise it's like trying to integrate East and West Germany as two separate countries. We've spent thousands of years slaughtering each other, to expect us to act as a homogenous country would be foolish and doomed to failure. I agree with integration to a point, but we need massive reform within Europe to comfortably reach that point, and I think in some cases that means going further into Europe, in others cutting back.",0,1298362890,null,0,false,0,c1ht2k3,t3_fpz6q,t1_c1ht2k3,t3_fpz6q,1426934959,16,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,16

Sound silly and irrelevant?  Yes and with good reason, the football team one supports provides us with no data of value for making policy and funding decisions.

The same is true for religion.  Religiosity, even when it is accurate, isn't really a good indicator for anything at all (things like poverty, education standards, health et cetera.).

The *only* areas it becomes relevant is an issue dealing with faith schools (which we should be abolishing anyway) and other minor faith related issues such as the religious broadcasting on the BBC (They should be allowed to decide how much they want to show).  But then, what football team people support also has a minor relevance in government decisions sometimes too.

It is not even remotely comparable to football teams. A person's religion is a core part of who they feel they are - in a lot of cases more so than race, sex or sexuality. Just because you don't identify with the question, you still have to understand that for the majority of people in this country it *is* important.

Also, if you take a look at social issues in this country, you will see that there is useful information to be gleaned. Many areas of the country with high Islamic population also have issues with girls being denied schooling, being forced to marry, even genital mutilation and 'honour killings'. Sorry for singling outr Islam, but it is the one with the most issues.

the gun culture of the US is seem in very simple terms by UK viewers as we have a completely different culture too it or its meaning.
its as ingrained in to the make up of the US constitution as the monarchy/Parliament  is to the our country.

its also an issue that generates massive negative press that gets blown out of proportion. 

the incidence of weapons preventing crime or saving lives are really reported and the negative story's published instantly this distorts the real effects of guns. there is well over 200 million legal guns in the states and many more unregistered and illegal firearms making supply as available as cars yet still they don't have running battles on the streets as some portray it.

its also not as clear cut issue a gun is an item its the individual and there mental and physical health, education and economic situations which have a far grater effect on crime levels than availability of tools this is the area of the US that is the real problem.

A person's football team is a core part of who they feel they are - in a lot of cases more so than race, sex, sexuality or religious beliefs.  Just because you don't identify with the question, you still have to understand that for the majority of people in this country it is important.

Yes, I did go there for the simple fact that for **some** people it's completely true and I disagree entirely that the majority of people in this country feel this question is important.  *For every single census prior to 2001 there was **no** question regarding religion and there wasn't remotely a fuss.*

Who are you or the government to decide what is more important in my life or to even know?

&gt;Also, if you take a look at social issues in this country, you will see that there is useful information to be gleaned.

Why don't you name some issues where valuable insight will be gained from the data collected through this census then?  Those issues you described won't in the slightest be affected by this question.

Legal issues with Islam? Nope; Sexism?  Nope;  Religious Extremism?  Nope; Social Cohesion?  Nope.

Mind providing some examples of strong local communities where it was shown the reason for success was religion?

&gt;What about the faith schools? You seem dismissive of these as an issue, yet the amount of our money that has been spent on them makes it very relevant, especially when they can circumvent the national curriculum.

I just provided the *obvious* solution to all the issues regarding faith schools, abolish them.

&gt;Religious broadcasting? As the BBC is funded by taxpayer's money, don't you think it should have an output that actively reflects the taxpayer's make-up?

I believe it is up to the BBC to decide how it will accurately reflect British culture, not the result of a census taken once every ten years with a question completely lacking in depth and completely biased towards Religion.  Like I said, does this mean I should have a question regarding my Football affiliations?  After all, I'd like to see my team get more coverage on the BBC, who wouldn't?  Right?

&gt;Which is the whole point of this article. To get people to take the question seriously, and give an accurate answer, so we will have accurate figures.

The question wasn't necessary or relevant to the running of the country until Tony the religious nutter Blair decided to put it on the census and I don't see how it is remotely necessary now.

As some background, I'm an American, but I studied in the UK about a year ago and have been back three or four times since.  I'm dating an English woman, and we discuss these issues quite frequently.  I hope I can give some insight.

&gt;* 
Their totally weird insistence that there are different cultures within the U.S., and that this absolutely justifies them not traveling anywhere outside of it.

There *are* totally different cultures within the U.S., and I think it is hard to really understand this unless you've met a lot of people from all over or have gone to certain places where the distinctions are obvious and sharp.  My girlfriend was shocked to discover that certain groups of people just simply talked differently than others despite being from the same area.  However, this does not justify US citizens not traveling outside of it.  

Also, you also have to remember that traveling to Europe or Asia is difficult and expensive.  Europe is especially difficult when compared to how easy it is for people in Europe to visit other parts of Europe.  Relatively, going to Canada or Mexico is quite easy.  And, when a lot of American do not have the money to afford the closer countries, the only way they can travel is to go to a different state.

Another odd thing I've encountered and have to explain about not traveling elsewhere is that a lot of Europeans are euro-centric.  They view visiting, say, Prague as a cultured vacation compared to going from Nevada to Colorado.  While Prague is radically different than, say, Spain and Nevada and Colorado are quite culturally similar, I think the issue about ease of travel and price issue also plays a factor.

So, with all of this, I am not trying to say this justifies not traveling outside of the US, but I hope it explains how some people justify traveling inside the US.

&gt;* Their intolerance for dialects of English other than American dialects.

Having traveled the UK, I found the people to be equally intolerant of American dialects.

Everything else is completely spot on.

true,back-in-black,english,England,"&gt; There are totally different cultures within the U.S., and I think it is hard to really understand this unless you've met a lot of people from all over or have gone to certain places where the distinctions are obvious and sharp.

I've travelled in the U.S. To me, at least, there was an obvious distinction between people in New York, and those in, say,  California. However, in the grand scheme of things these differences *are* small. If you're going to say that New Yorkers and Californians come from different *cultures*, then you have redifined the word *culture* such that, for the UK, you would consider Cornish, Welsh, West Coast Scots, East Coast Scots, Scouse, Cockney, Geordie, etc, to be different cultures. Some of those even actually have their own languages, lending weight to the argument. Cornish and Manx, for example, died out comparatively recently. The same goes for every country in Europe. Spain and Italy have regional languages, cuisines and traditions that I know of, and I'm sure many other nations do too. 

But, if *those* are different cultures, then what are we to make of the general difference between, say, Britain and France? Do we have to introduce a concept of ""Meta-Culture"", to cover what was formally meant by the word ""Culture""? In this sense Britain would be one Meta-Culture, and the U.S. would be one Meta-Culture. 

And its at that point where I think ""Fuck it, that's just convoluted"". Minor intra-nation differences don't merit the label ""culture"". 

&gt; Also, you also have to remember that traveling to Europe or Asia is difficult and expensive. Europe is especially difficult when compared to how easy it is for people in Europe to visit other parts of Europe. Relatively, going to Canada or Mexico is quite easy. And, when a lot of American do not have the money to afford the closer countries, the only way they can travel is to go to a different state.

I rarely saw Americans backpacking anywhere on my travels, including South America. I think they may have an aversion to it. I'm not sure the money-and-distance argument cuts it. New Zealand is on the arse end of the planet, and you find Kiwis absolutely everywhere doing their OE.

&gt; Another odd thing I've encountered and have to explain about not traveling elsewhere is that a lot of Europeans are euro-centric. They view visiting, say, Prague as a cultured vacation compared to going from Nevada to Colorado.

Most would also view visiting Cambodia or India as more ""cultured vacation"" than going from Nevada to Colorado. And I agree with that. So they are not really Eurocentric in the sense that you mean. 

&gt; Having traveled the UK, I found the people to be equally intolerant of American dialects.

To a certain degree this is true. We are often intolerant of each others dialects too. But the stick you get from Americans as a Brit, Kiwi or Aussie for ""talking funny"" is on an entirely different level. This is simply because, as you implicitly agree with above, you are a much more insular nation with less exposure to those that speak English differently to yourselves. The gut reaction for many Americans when they first encounter a foreign English speaker seems to be ""Y U no talk English?"" 

But as we are specifically talking about reddit - you are never going to get a Brit posting a reply to an American saying something like ""HERP DERP, Howdy 'pardner"", but I constantly see people identified as Brits get the ""Oh, Jolly good show, toodle-pip"" treatment, from some twit on the other side of the Atlantic. It gets old.

The worst part of this is, I am American. Having visited the UK, lived in Germany for a few months, and visited other countries in Europe, I immediately realized that America doesn't have culture. We have something, but endless rows of strip malls and pavement, bland boring music and movies, it just felt bankrupt in comparison to centuries of history and the very human interactions that I had (especially in Leipzig).

That was the other main difference, how impersonal and fake people in the US can be, and how ignorance and emotionality in conversation are accepted as the norm, how intelligence can often be ignored and even shunned as ""pretentious and too snooty.""

As far as this particular web-site goes, American redditors often exemplify the issues I mentioned above - ignorance, group-think mentality, laziness (abusing memes until they are dead, reposting, repeating clever phrases and puns), an uncaring and almost nihilistic attitude towards world events (egypt, to this site, means guy with bread on his head).

The only way to break that would be to dismantle the monarchy, which IIRC isn't currently the most popular idea, but tides are slowly changing with each new generation.  This is why the Queen doesn't do much despite her powers, she knows that any prominence in British politics or cultural affairs will only lead to a decrease in popularity.

Every census? Are you *sure* about that? And no fuss? *Really?*

&gt;I disagree entirely that the majority of people in this country feel this question is important.

That's why over 85% identified themselves as belonging to a religion, and less then 8% refused to answer. I would think that proves that most felt it was important enough to answer.

&gt;Those issues you described won't in the slightest be affected by this question.
&gt;Legal issues with Islam? Nope; Sexism? Nope; Religious Extremism? Nope; Social Cohesion? Nope.

Now I **know** you're just being obtuse. By having an accurate census of which areas are Muslim-dominated, they know where to focus efforts to combat these problems. You can't *seriously* tell me you don't grasp this concept?

See [this page](http://www.statistics.gov.uk/focuson/religion/) from the Office for National Statistics for more details of issues the religion question highlights, and which also proves it's not *just* about allowing people to express thier identity, as you seem to think.

&gt;I just provided the obvious solution to all the issues regarding faith schools, abolish them.

Spoken like a true Atheist - Not a single iota of consideration for those not of your own religious (yes, religious) persuation. Note, not 'atheist' but Atheist. The ones who are as dogmatic and ignorant as the extremist Theists are.

The 2001 census was the first census to pose a question regarding the religious beliefs of the nation.  We've been having census's every ten years since 1801 and yet it was quite clearly never seen as being an issue prior to 2001.

While it's true that 85% identified themselves as belonging to a religion in a biased leading question in the 2001 census I think it's important to consider, as we see in the BBC article, in the *annual* British Social Attitudes survey they find 51% describe themselves as non-religious.

It isn't *my* belief as to why they asked the question, it's *their own justification*.  My belief is that it was included so that there was justification for an expansion of faith schools et cetera.

The reason why faith schools are bad, aside from some education system reasons that I won't go into here, is that they are socially divisive and damage social cohesion as a result.  

Presuming that communities of a particular religion are breaking the law is a *terrible* idea that only serves to isolate them.  If you want to know the best way to identify areas that suffer from problems you need only look at crime rates, the socio-economic make up of areas or those with high levels of immigration (Those last two go hand-in-hand and are the cause for most issues in this country).

These problems aren't rampant in or unique to Islamic communities and it's naÃ¯ve to believe so.  All the data from this census question provides is a way to discriminate against people due to their religious beliefs or lack thereof, something we *obviously* don't want (Well, most mature and reasonable adults do, even if you don't).

true,Marogian,eng-essex,Essex boy in London,"The way they still believe in the 'American Dream' due to sappy stories of self-made billionaires which exist in every democracy, when pretty much every other Western country has higher social mobility no matter how you measure it. America has a more ingrained class system than the UK does, imho, but the Americans don't recognise it because they're indoctrinated to think that the US is class-less.

Related: Fraternities. I find them repulsive, but most Americans seem to love them. Those scenes from The Social Network remind me of scare-stories from a bygone era at Oxbridge (Hello, Bullingdon Club).

Patriotism. For a people who are all immigrants I find their blind belief in supporting their country of birth rather strange. Its just a milder flavour of Nationalism, which I detest and generally consider to be an attribute of those with a lack of critical thought.

How they all hate the police, until someone randomly posts a ""good"" police story to change the tone, then they go back to hating the police. Jesus. Perhaps if the cops didn't walk around with giant penis extenders (GUN CONTROL ZOMG) they wouldn't act like cunts so much.

Two Party Politics. What the fuck. I mean, sure, we're pretty similar, but a large vocal group of people WANT to change that desperately and actively support other parties.

Constitution Worship: Why for the love of all that is holy, do they worship a piece of paper some guys 300 years ago wrote? Were they some kind of divine prophets come to teach us lowly mortals how we should run our country? No? Then WHY does any proposed change in the law have to come down to a debate about what these mystical 'Founding Fathers' were thinking about 300 years ago? I bet at least half of them were thinking about wanking. Sure, it protects human rights, it has good things in it. That doesn't mean its perfect! It doesn't mean that, you know, there might actually be more to a good set of government than this stupid piece of trash document. AGhh. The amount of times an argument with someone they perceive to be wrong comes down to ""Blah blah the founding fathers were judeo-christians!"" ""Blah blah, the Founding Fathers wanted a strict separation of church and state!""! Jesus. WHO GIVES A FUCK. Its YOUR country, not THEIRS. Do what YOU want with the country, not what you think these THREE HUNDRED YEAR OLD BRITISH GUYS wanted.

If we went around basing our idea of good governance on the prevailing feelings from 300 years ago I'm pretty sure my favourite pornography would be banned.

Insult the constitution at your peril. Its the basis of everything wonderful in the Universe.

""A blistering critique of Churchill's life: his financial polices; his lack of humanity and chivalry in war; his bad temper; his bad habits and his insatiable blood lust.
The books describes Churchill's military career starting with his activities on the North West Frontier of India on the Afghan border, Omdurman in the Sudan and the Boer War in South Africa.
During the First World War the Lusitania Incident and Gallipoli draw the author's wrath.
During the WWII the fighting in Norway, and Dieppe are examined. He points out that the attack on the French Fleet at Mers el Kebir was not necessary as Britain held the gates to the Mediterranean at Gibraltar.
He shows that Churchill was a strong supporter of the Balfour Declaration and was an ardent Zionist.

true,ragewind,uk,,"there is but its not in the same sense we would see militia now.

we see it as a trained and structured army if even as a reserve force such as the TA or other part time force.

at the time the constitution was written they has just overthrown the oppressive British government and there was no formal army of any sort. the militia at that time was the general population of the state to ensure its own survival. ""A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State"" this is linking the militia with the state level safety.

there is also the following line ""the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed."" this is in there to recognize that without the ownership of the privet arms they would never have over thrown the British rule and to prevent there being any more oppressive government that can control the people.

interestingly this was all based on the English Bill of Rights of 1689 which has a section that mentions the holding of arms by the people again, this was after a time when king James the 2rd tried to disarm all protestants. 

we may have ignored and over ruled this as a document of law but it has been used in US courts and even there they have decided that its original meaning was for the people like the US document.

unlike the UK in the US its near impossible/ not allowed to remove the founding documents from law which makes it a hole bigger issue that has ramifications on all parts of the document like freedom of speech and no false imprisonment etc.",0,1298419687,null,0,false,0,c1hwstd,t3_fq7pg,t1_c1hwstd,t1_c1hwleh,1426936776,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

It was a long time ago and I was a lot younger, so you'll have to forgive me for any inaccuracies but if I remember correctly nobody I knew read the treaty, nor had access to the treaty - it wasn't the way things were done back then, so you relied largely on what the media told you (that a No vote would destroy the economy, which was already pretty messed up) and on what you heard from your peers which generally boiled down to whether you were in a labour or tory neighbourhood - and which type of Tory in some cases.

I remember seeing Tony Benn giving a speech about it in London, he was quite against it and I felt similarly, although I wasn't a big fan of Benn. I'm fairly certain that without the benefit of hindsight that the statement you quoted on could've been interpreted any which way you like at the time. I was too young to vote, but pushed my parents to vote Yes as I was worried about jobs, which was what the Yes campaign was largely based on around my area.

With hindsight I'm not sure how I'd have pushed, but without it the idea of taking down trade barriers and increasing cooperation (which was what it was mostly publicly about in the UK until the Major administration IIRC, not political union per se) seemed like a good idea in the 70s, our economy was screwed, we were the sick man of Europe, our empire was being dismantled and we were at risk of running out of coal and oil.",0,1298449196,null,0,false,0,c1hyuvs,t3_fpz6q,t1_c1hyuvs,t1_c1hvts7,1426937746,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

true,Shaper_pmp,null,null,"Anything ""could have been a factual programme"" if only they'd changed the writers, presenters and in fact the entire premise of the show.

The premise of this show was clearly to show Joanna Lumley going on a journey.  It's not to educate about the Northern Lights, it's not to teach geography.  It's not even like they started *planning* a documentary featuring David Attenborough and then gave in and decided to focus on a celebrity presenter.

Literally the *only point* of this show is to appeal to people who like pretty scenery, and to appeal to people who watching celebrities doing things.

They didn't try to make a serious factual show and fail - they set out to make a bit of light entertainment featuring celebrities, and (uninteresting though I find such programmes) they succeeded.  As such, your criticism that they aren't ""using actual experts and professors and the like to present appropriate programming"" falls utterly flat, because *this isn't a documentary series*.

Now, if you're complaining that the BBC is giving into populism by making shows like this then that's a completely different matter, but it's emphatically *not* what anyone in this thread is discussing.  It's completely off-topic.

However, can I then assume that if you claim this:

&gt; Populist programmes could by definition be made on an advertising funded channel. I resent having to pay for this crap when it could be farmed off to a non-publicly funded channel.

That you *also* staunchly defend both the licence fee and the BBC receiving the lion's share of it?

Because there are far too many people who seem to think that the BBC should prove it's appealing to people by keeping its viewing figures comparable to commercial TV *in order to justify* its share of the licence fee... and when it starts slipping immediately jump on that as an excuse to reduce it on the basis ""the BBC isn't fulfilling its mandate of appealing to the population"".

FWIW yes, I'd like it too if the BBC did more of what it was good at - interesting, thoughtful, educated (and educational) public-service programming.  However, I'd *also* like it if (as that sentiment requires) we lived in a world where the BBC isn't under constant attack and criticism in the media and politics for ""going too lowest common denominator"" when it appeals to baser tastes, and for ""not justifying the licence fee"" when it cuts back on pleb-fodder and tries to present more educational, public-interest, but less-mass-appeal programming.

Ultimately, I'd like to live in a world where people only made reasoned, fair criticisms, and the population generally valued educational documentaries over watching some crass nobody from Big Brother eat a live beetle on TV.  Sadly, however, *this isn't that world*, and any criticism which is predicated on either ignoring well-funded rival commercial agendas or fundamentally changing the tastes of the nation is a non-starter. :-(

Edit: Also, popularity is [officially BBC1's remit](http://www.bbc.co.uk/aboutthebbc/services/channels_tv.shtml), with Channels 2 and 4 being dedicated to highbrow, educational and similar content.  For that reason it's tough to blame the BBC for chasing popularity when they're apparently *[legally mandated](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_service_broadcasting_in_the_United_Kingdom)* to do so as a condition of their broadcasting licence. :-/",0,1298457729,null,0,true,0,c1hz51g,t3_fqm3p,t1_c1hz51g,t1_c1hz359,1426937886,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

Perhaps this is the crux of our misunderstanding - I understood from your [post](http://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/fqm3p/why_cant_she_just_fuck_off/c1hynwj) that you were characterising *the BBC specifically* as being the primary or main channel where unqualified idiots are treated like experts.  That's why I ""corrected"" you that the entire media does it, not just the BBC.

However as I understand it now you were only actually *criticising* the BBC for it (not implying they were the only ones who did it at all) - right?

So (again, as I understand it) you acknowledge that all the major channels do this (and some more regularly/overtly than the BBC), but only *criticise* the BBC (as opposed to all the other channels) for doing it because as a publicly-funded channel you feel they ought to be above it - correct?

If this is true then my sincere apologies for misunderstanding.

true,anonymouslemming,null,null,"A couple of things for you then...

Firstly, one of the biggest problem with CCTV cameras is that they do not stop crime. There was a fairly decent report back around 2005 that went into this - http://www.police999.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=574:cctv-does-not-stop-crime&amp;catid=35:crime-news&amp;Itemid=55

Onto some of the negative effects of the current cameras ...

The few thugs who care enough to notice them, just move their activities to areas without cameras. These are normally more residential or rural areas and this has a negative impact on the communities where they move.

For the most part though, people who commit crimes continue to do so in front of the cameras - they are no deterrent and people who plan to punch someone will keep doing so - history proves this. This isn't a problem with the cameras, other than the fact that they cost a lot of money to not achieve what they are supposed to.

We already have a lot of cases of people doing stupid (but harmless) in public and the footage making its way to youtube - that's only going to get worse as time goes on. Some of those people have faced huge amounts of ridicule. If you fall into a fountain, you expect the people around the fountain to laugh at you. You _don't_ expect the whole world to laugh at you because you became an overnight sensation. 

Some foolish organisations even like the idea of having members of the public watching the cameras instead of paying people to do this. One would really hope that you can see the problem with this idea ? Even more footage will leak into the public.

A lot of the footage available today lacks context. Two people doing a piece of street performance can look just like an assault. And while the police _may_ investigate and find nothing wrong, you can still show up on vigilantesRus.com as a violent thug who beats little girls.

I'm actually not that worried about the state - we can always kick them out of office. And individuals don't worry me that much either because historically we don't have a good record of organising for an extended period of time.

Corporations are the big worry. 

Here's a pretty simple example - go and talk to someone in product placement or floor plan design for a retail store. If you've been in a big shop, there's a very good chance that someone has spent a LOT of time studying how you look at things, where you step and how long you stand places. There is probably video on file for this. You picking your nose. You staring into space. You staring at that other person while you wait for your SO to pick something off the rack.

Being free at the point of use is something I think we should be very careful about removing as it is one of the best aspects about the NHS. But yeah, any move towards a private insurance model **must** be met with an equivilent reduction in tax.

As for tax, I would be in favour of re-arranging NI or scrapping it, in favour of a system where the NHS costs are met entirely by a seperate healthcare tax. This money alone is used for funding healthcare costs, and increases to the healthcare budget must be met with an increase to that tax. At the moment we have a variety of taxes that are mostly thrown into a bit pot and divide up between whatever services require funding.

&gt;Eve Myles previously appeared in the Doctor Who episode ""The Unquiet Dead"" as Gwyneth, a 19th century clairvoyant connected with the Cardiff Rift. In response to questions about the similarity of the characters' names, showrunner Russell T Davies denied that they were connected, stating that they are ""just two names beginning with ""G""."" The Doctor Who episode ""Journey's End"" later alluded to a familial relationship between the characters, explaining their physical resemblance as the result of ""spatial genetic multiplicity"". Eve Myles said of the characters' relation, ""to be playing a character who's connected to Gwyneth, to be a relation of hers, is just incredibly clever, I think. It was never on the cards as such, but something in the back of my head always said that they were going to be connected somehow."" However, Russell T Davies maintained that the relationship between the characters is not literal, stating that ""It's not familial as we understand it"", instead characterising spatial genetic multiplicity as ""an echo and repetition of physical traits across a Time Rift.""",0,1298521985,null,0,false,0,c1i3lur,t3_fri69,t1_c1i3lur,t3_fri69,1426940052,11,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,11

If people are forced to pay for a service they do not use, they will object, and vote for parties that will reduce that tax.

I see and understand exactly what you're saying, especially given how much tax has gone down in real terms over the past 14 years :)

I think there's a difference, the rich already do what they can to reduce Tax, which tends to have a knock on effect on their NI Contributions anyway - the rich are not funding the NHS as it is. The moderately well off have larger numbers and tend to be salaried so make the full contributions.

I would envisage a situation where the well off have the option to go for private healthcare to cover certain things that the NHS has traditionally not been great at or has been overloaded such as chronic illness treatment and have an incentive to do so (e.g. a partial drop in their employee NICs). If their employee and employer NIC drops and the gap is reasonable, that incentivises their employer to offer private healthcare packages for these things. I'm not saying that if you turn up at A&amp;E with half your arm missing and blood spurting everywhere you shouldn't be treated, just that the NHS needs to look at what it struggles to do and needs a bit of breathing room on, then look to encourage competition as a way of improving it.

Stress.   At least for me, there seems to be a direct correlation between feeling stressed and an eczema flare-up. Creams etc help symptoms when need be, but I've little doubt the underlying trigger is stress.

Now I regard it as an indicator, ie the start of a flare-up is a flag to tell me to 'chill out' more, and pretty much as soon as I have this realisation and make efforts to relax more, it fades away again. Similarly, there can be a vicious circle effect where if it starts getting worse, you get more stressed and anxious about it, which only seems to make it worse. So, paying it attention is bad; ignoring it is good - easier said than done.

This isn't to say it isn't important to take care of skin dryness etc, but for me, de-stressing has been the best control.

Your mileage may vary of course.  Good luck.

true,Ivashkin,null,null,"The general view is that Big Society is a load of BS. But I would disagree with that. The over the years, and especially in the last administration the role of the state has grown massively, and a lot of this has been centralized. This has resulted in the central government taking a one size fits all approach to many public services and running everything on a national level. Basically centralized feature creep. We've also had the idea that the only way of improving public services is to increase funding, which is running into issues for a variety of reasons. One being that no matter how much we may complain about services not working as well as we want them to, the idea of paying more tax to fund this is not a vote winner (unless it is people with more money than you having tax increased). So the issue that we and many western states now face is how do we increase the effectiveness of public services without having to spend more money on them? And how do we move away from a situation where a large minority of people are utterly reliant on the state?

Big society is an attempt to move power away from the state, and back to the people. Cameron talks about some aspects of it [here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ELnyoso6vI). Weirdly, many of the EU nations we talk about as having amazing public services that we should aim to replicate are very decentralized, but in the UK this is seen as a bad thing. This is probally because local authorities are often seen as bastions of poor decision making, wasting money and minor corruption. So at the heart of this the idea is to decentralize powers away from the central state, and increase the powers of local authorities, charities and groups of people to do stuff themselves.

They need to be lending if the private sector has any hope of picking up the massive amounts of slack that is going to be left.

Our society is heavily reliant on credit, which for much of the last decade or so was easy to obtain. It got to the point where banks were making risky loans in order to make a profit selling them on. This had to stop, and we have to return to a sensible level of lending as unmanageable debt is a problem for many people and small businesses. Banks do need to hold higher amounts of capital to cover their loses as the entire credit crunch was caused by banks being over extended and unable to meet their obligations, resulting in a need to bail them out. If we want to prevent what just happened from happening a decade down the line the banks need to be more careful about who they lend money to, and how much capital they are holding to cover bad loans.

true,bull0x,gold,xyzzy,"I'm assuming you mean the [University of Bristol](http://www.bristol.ac.uk), not the [University of the West of England](http://www.uwe.ac.uk)? I'm currently doing a research PhD in aerospace at UoB and am a senior resident at Clifton Hill House. I lived here as a fresher in 2001, and have come back after 4 years teaching in London.

You've got a few choices to make. The first two are pretty common to all unis and the third is Bristol specific:

1) Hall of residence or student house? The halls are larger, some are catered, and generally have student committees that organise things. There are student houses that the university owns, I think some of them have senior residents too but I don't think there are as many organised events.

2) Catered or self-catered? There are some catered and some self-catered. I think that going catered means that you can focus on other stuff in first year, and meal times are great opportunities to meet people and make friends, but some people prefer to do it themselves.

3) Near or far from Uni? There are three halls in Clifton, close to the University, and six in Stoke Bishop, about a half-hour walk from the main precinct. Student houses are dotted around town. The Clifton halls are smaller and more expensive than the Stoke Bishop ones, but 10 mins to uni is good. I hear the walk in from the further halls isn't too bad because hundreds of students are doing the same at the same time, and there's more opportunity for bar crawls between halls etc.

There's also a great deal of difference in the character of the halls. Some are modern(ish) buildings, others are older. Some are more formal than others - Wills has formal meals once a week with students wearing gowns!

My two bits is this: you're going to make great friends wherever you are - uni's a pretty formative experience for a lot of people, and everyone's in the same boat as you. Put some thought into where to love, but don't stress too much. If you want, arrange to visit a couple of halls to see what they're like.

I mean, if you want an action game...make an action game.  If you want a puzzle game...make a puzzle game.  But don't try to blend them together.

* drink driving was fine but a few generations ago
* casual racism was endemic

Gaining a groundswell of opinion for something as seemingly innocuous as 0.05% levy on every 'speculative' financial transaction could become a 'dinner table conversation' item.

It's such a seemingly trivial amount that even the piggiest of pigs would be embarrassed to gainsay it, at least in public.

Puffing on the cigar and going ""Bahahhahahahahahha! *drag* Aaahhahahhahahahahah!"" would become gauche.

Basically, it's creaming off a trivial but worthwhile skim, whilst not hurting anyone (crucially, including the piggies) so much that they'd squeal...at the same time ridiculing the die-hard right-wingers through social pressure.

true,proton5000,null,null,"As an American, I may be able to provide some perspective on Constitution Worship.

Basically, after the American Revolution, Americans wanted some rules in place to make sure we had guaranteed rights so that the citizens would be protected from the government. America has been suspicious of ALL government from its very conception, and the Constitution reflects this.

America started out with The Articles of Confederation, but that didn't end up working out too well. After this, the Constitution was formed. In the Constitution was the Bill of Rights, which really made it stick. Americans now could own guns (2nd Amendment) along with free speech (1st Amendment) and 8 other original amendments.

These first ten Amendments set the precedent of all other modifications to the Constitution - if you wanted to change something, and Amendment had to be added. 

Nothing that is deemed ""unconstitutional"" can be added to the Constitution. This is good in a sense, for it prevents the federal government taking away freedom of speech and the right to a lawyer and such (although there have been many exceptions to these rules, particularly during wartime and against minorities, sadly).

Since the Constitution was so instrumental in the shaping of early America, it is worshiped by American politicians, and, as a result, the drone-like masses also worship it.

It is also extremely important to note that the Constitution was the document that detailed the formation of the three branches of the federal government that are still seen today - The Legislative Branch (Congress, makes laws, issues taxes, declares war), The Judicial Branch (interprets whether laws are Constitutional), and the Executive Branch (President, carries out the law, commander in chief of armed forces).

Once again, due to the Constitution's instrumental role in forming the modern American government, the document is worshiped.

Sadly, the levels of Constitution worship today are at a point where America is becoming crippled from within its own system. Laws cannot be passed if they are useful to the general public BUT are unconstitutional. This poses a lot of problems, because there are many problems and situations in the world today that the Founding Fathers could never have dreamed about.

tl;dr - Essentially, the Constitution is outdated and politicians here in America prioritize following and ""interpreting"" it over actually doing anything useful for the American general public.",0,1298602260,null,0,false,0,c1i8p9z,t3_fq7pg,t1_c1i8p9z,t1_c1hwqcq,1426942456,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

true,DaveLambert,tardis,TARDIS,"Rose, as the person we initially meet, certainly has her flaws...the worst one, IMHO, being how she treats Mickey. But to see her from the Doctor's point of view, especially a post-Time-War Doctor, we have a human who ""gets it"" in ways most don't, who's brave enough to overcome her fears and find ways to contribute to the journey (starting with her saving 9 from the Autons and Nestene Consciousness). And she goes on to do so much, through the stopping of the Daleks and helping him with the regeneration...well, by ""School Reunion"", as Rose's meeting with Sarah Jane pointed out, The Doctor was (still) oblivious to it all at that point.  After all, Rose hadn't really done anything that tons of other companions hadn't done (including and especially Sarah Jane!).  Still, it seemed like after that, and especially after Rise Of The Cybermen/The Age Of Steel, 10 began to slowly take more PERSONAL notice of Rose.  To the point where they had the ending they did in Doomsday.

Well, I guess you cannot help who you fall in love with, even if you're The Doctor.  And yeah, I was feeling it, too.  I'm an old Doctor Who fan from way back, and I didn't think he should fall for a companion.  But he did, and to me it felt right.  I was, and am, good with it.

Then Martha came along, and like many other companions she felt attracted to him, and he didn't reciprocate. ESPECIALLY right after losing Rose.  ""So this is me, getting out""...I think that was a good way to play that out.  And then the ""I just want a mate"" thing with Donna; cool.  But all the time Martha was companion there were a ton of fans out there, and network forces acknowledging those fans, who felt strongly that Rose's story was left incomplete.  Duh, it was supposed to be!  But the powers that be gave in to the pressure and brought Billie Piper back in for anther turn as Rose - a by-now badass Rose - in Turn Left/Stolen Earth/Journey's End (plus the Bad-Wolf-style cameos in Partners in Crime, Poison Sky and Midnight which led up to that).

Rose's reapparance in TL/SE/JE might have ruined Rose for some, but I took it with a grain of salt.  After all, what they did with Rose in that 3-part story wasn't NEARLY as ridiculous as what they did with Donna.  Nevertheless, I still enjoyed it all; seeing Davros again wasn't too awful, and neither was seeing all of 10's companions get together for one big adventure...and exploring the idea that The Doctor fashions companions into ""weapons"" was interesting (if possibly taken a bit too far).

Bottom line is that I DID enjoy the 10-and-Rose relationship, even if they didn't know when to stop (per the S4 reapparances and the 10 clone). I truly hope that Billie Piper's nicely subtle appearance in ""The End of Time"" is the last we ever see of her in Doctor Who, just because Rose's story needs to be over (I enjoy watching Billie in Secret Diary of a Call Girl, and I'll check out anything else she does next).

Also, coming back around to 'ships that shouldn't be, the way Mickey and Martha ended up (totally out of left field) was terrible.  Something done just for the sake of doing it, with no real thought behind it other than a TV-style ""wrap up"" to put a period at the end of these characters' stories.  Ugh.  If they were working together without the rest of it, that would have been okay with me.  But it went too far for them in 10's final story.  AmIright?

EDIT: to make a long post even longer, am I the only one who likes River Song and wonders who/what she is, but feels that if they DO end up making River some sort of romantic attachment to the Doctor, that it would feel a bit like being a bit of a betrayal to his relationship with Rose?

This stunt is simply trying to make people question *why* they think it is strange.

There is a growing movement to help people understand that breastmilk is amazing, brilliant stuff that is **far** better than any formula for making babies grow up healthy and strong. Companies like Nestle are responsible for this misinformation which stated decades ago - they aren't allowed to do it any more but generations of grandparents still have influence over the parenting choices of their own children. So some people choose not to breastfeed their baby because they are uncomfortable with it.

Every year there are many news stories about how many people chose Jedi in the consensus. A simple google search will demonstrate that - 70,000 in Australia, so many in New Zealand etc. In fact, the only reason I know about Jedis and religion is because during the last consensus there was lots of news coverage about people ticking Jedi. The same is true for you; you know about it because of the news coverage about it. The more people that tick Jedi, the more the world hears about it and the more people see that it's OK to take the piss out of religion and that religion is becoming more something that people ridicule and less something people take seriously. 

In the last consensus everyone thought it was hilarious and as a result it ridiculed religion. The fact that for every 100 people that ticked christian there was 1 that ticked Jedi was very newsworthy, and if twice as many ticked it this year it would be even more newsworthy. The same isn't true if all those 1 out of 101 people ticked ""no religion"" instead. As a result there would be 0 people that ticked Jedi and no news about that and the percentages for ""no religion"" would be changed from 14.7% to 15.4% - a thoroughly non-newsworthy event; something that even the most boring statistician in the world wouldn't be slightly interested in.

So in the first case a religious group might argue that religious groups need public funding because 77.48% of people are religious. This is how the consensus figures are presented, with Jedi and Humanist excluded from religion

And in the second case a religious group might argue that religious groups need public funding because 78.18% of people are religious. This is not how the census figures are presented, and requires that the religious group digs into the stats and moves the Jedis from non religious group to the religious group

The part that makes clear what they mean is *""[because at some time or place, someone will refer only to the explicit âNo religionâ answers, from which you will be left out if you answered âJediâ](http://census-campaign.org.uk/faq/jedi-knights/)""*. By explicit ""No religion"" answers they mean consensus forms where people explicitly ticked ""No religion"" but excluding consensus forms where people ticked ""Other"" and wrote Jedi. But the National Statistics office compiles and presents the results and they've already put all the people who ticked ""Other"" and wrote Jedi in the ""No Religion"" section. A religious group would have to unravel that compilation in a deliberate attempt to manipulate the figures, to increase the religious group by 0.7%. a) they're not going to bother for that small figure and b) if they do that provides a perfect opportunity to argue against them by showing that they've gone out of their way to manipulate the figures and c) provides a perfect opportunity to publicly disrupt their funding attempts by showing that they're deliberately trying to get public funding for Jedis",0,1298651744,null,0,true,0,c1ib2io,t3_fshx2,t1_c1ib2io,t1_c1ib0bc,1426943635,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

* We might not be sure where he is, so it would probally take more than one to do the job (almost certainly it would take loads of them).

* Collateral damage, if we hit the wrong building and kill non-combatants then the uproar both domestically, internationally and internally would be huge. This sub-reddit would be screaming for murder if Cameron ordered a strike and it killed non-combatants.

* It's meddling. Probably the most important aspect of this, the Libyans have to earn their freedom. If we interfere then it stops being a peoples revolution and becomes a western backed regime change. It is also a risk of being seen as neo-colonial. 

* We don't have a mandate to get involved yet. If the situation turns into genocide and not a civil war then it is likely that the EU/US/UN will deploy troops but at the moment both China and Russia are against that and Germany/France/Britian are hesitant to do so. The US are drawing up plans to get involved but they won't be greenlit without EU backing, which will almost certainly require UN support.

Basically, unless we have a chance of deploy assets to deal with Gaddafi covertly (oh dear, someone shot him, we shall never know who... etc) then we would have to do it openly. This would be seen as a regime change. What I suspect will happen is once Gaddafi is gone the EU will deploy peace keepers as the place will probally go into anarchy (there is no power structure aside from Gaddafis, no unions, no opposition, no military, it's not like Tunisa or Egypt).

You say that bureaucracy is the cause of failure in the service sector, and you're right. However, this isn't nearly as much of a problem in the private sector as it is this the public sector. In the private sector, profit incentives help get rid of surplus labour however, in the public sector, temptations to reduce unemployment discourage social Darwinism, *encouraging* surplus labour and thus bureaucracy.

true,The3rdWorld,eng-essex,Essex,"so you're saying if enough of us tick jedi that they might have a lord vader sitting in the posh house?  sounds cool.  England has long been the evil empire, seems fitting we have a suitably amusing sham government if we're going to have one.  -oh and yeah the UK is the only western democracy to do a lot of things, is it so wrong to be individual? 
  
The winning answer to 'there are only 14 people who ticked no religion' is 'yeah and two million picked a religion from a pop sci-film, quarter of a million worship noodles, another quarter of a million worship a lazy pipe smoker and somewhere in the region of a million more people worship their own idiosyncratic joke deity (from Cithula to Inglip through self and ZAWALDO)....'  
  
Religion doesn't deserve to be taken seriously, for a start its a well established tact that beside god and money the only thing that holds religion together is the fact people take it seriously.  Mock it like it should be mocked, treat it lightly as it should be treated - you can believe in anything, it doesn't and shouldn't matter -we have no alternative to just making fo with a guess of whats best -certainly science DOESN'T have all the answers not for the next thuosand or so years is science going to be able to even begin to understand sociological forces at play on the psychological zeitgeist, allowing the scientific status-quo to hold the same godhead position god once held is as absurd as god -any serious believer in science will tell you this, it's the very basis of the scientific method.
