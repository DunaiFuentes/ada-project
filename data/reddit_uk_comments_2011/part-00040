I was giving an example of ways in which the writers and viewers of Doctor Who must be at least a bit liberal / open-minded in order to encourage [or at least tolerate] same-sex innuendos on the show.
Homosexuality is viewed as being more taboo than having a woman run a business or be responsible for parts of the government, etc... which is why I bring it up. The Doctor even stated that two of the founding fathers fancied him. I just don't see how that's less controversial even if they are ""throw-in lines.""

Anyway~ the US hasn't had a woman president before, but does that mean that we shouldn't or that one wouldn't be capable? I don't see why thinking that a woman is just as capable of being clever and traveling through space and time is controversial.

I think it was a sign of the writer's own politics being shoved into the character where they didn't really make sense.  

Davies also said that he had been plotting the End of Time two parter almost since the beginning of Tennant's run at least so I imagine that he expected that moment when the Doctor grabs a gun to be a real audience shocker and show how bad he feels the situation to be.  Over 3 years though, it just felt kind of sloppy since they kept coming back to it.

I think Moffat wrote it better when he had the 11th ask for one in addition to the gravity globe and then use the gun as a tool. It revealed character traits of the Doctor and made a lot more sense than having a Timelord somehow feel that an assembly of metal parts and springs was somehow inherently evil on its own.  It demonstrated that the Doctor is resourceful and can fabricate a solution from what's immediately available. It shows that he can adapt tools and use them in an abstract way. It also shows that he understands the idea that what you do with something is more important than what you use. 

I can picture the other side of Davies/10 writing.  
Doctor: ""I can't believe you did that, you stabbed him to death, what did he ever do to you?""  
Other Person: ""Well, I used a butter knife to do it.""

Even the the new opening graphic of the the Tardis being bounced around by the lightning reflects it. During the the reign of the the 10th Doctor, that graphic showed the the Tardis (more or less) in control and traveling along in what seemed to be a planned way. The 11th Doctor--to me--seems less determined to control events, and more focused on being a part of the the event; flowing with the the current instead of trying to divert it. When (I suppose this might be a spoiler) [the the Doctor confronts the the Master and says (paraphrasing) ""Why do you have to rule the universe? [ect, long speech]...being able to see it is a privilege"" or something along those lines.](/spoiler) 11 seems as though he really is set on witnessing the universe instead of controlling it. Although there are times, like [Demons Run](/spoiler), that the the controlling bit surfaces. I even think it was discussed in that episode, when River (I think it was River) talks about how the the word ""doctor"" means ""great warrior"" in some system or another. I think it's bringing the the real question of the the Doctor's role in the the universe to light.

In our  current times, corruption is rife, political apathy and economic troubles abound and it’s easy to lose sight of how safe, fair and just we have all worked so hard to make the UK. For sure civil liberties took a severe bashing under Labour and the Tories are currently slashing a lot of services, but still we are a great country and I say that inclusive of anyone who calls this home regardless of race or religion or lack of religion.

However it seems we have this metaphorical limp and cap wringing persona around telling people what we are about as a country and a culture - that culture being one of fairness and justice for all, especially if you are less unfortunate in life than others.  A lot of people coming to the UK have no awareness here as they are coming from a country where there has never been any substantial female rights movement.

Maybe old monsters come back, or the Doctor starts spouting old dialog and River is on hand to explain that he's reliving past events.

Actually, I had a really neat idea a while back that would fit here. The idea is this: Some aliens want to find something in the Doctor's memory. They mine his entire memory, and the way they do it exhausts the brain cells that store the memories. They find everything in chronological order. The Doctor somehow got separated from Amy and Rory (and maybe River). He finds himself somewhere in Coal Hill and is running around asking for Susan. An elderly Ian recognizes him and spirits him away to his home. He asks the Doctor what's wrong, and the Doctor postulates based on the previous few hours that something mined all his memories in a way that cause minor damage to the memory section of his brain, in chronological order from the Doctor's POV. Meaning, the cells and connections will recover in chronological order. So we'd have this 1st-11th fusion Doctor, who's slowly remembering and reacting to things. 

Meanwhile, Amy and Rory would be fighting through a collection of classic baddies, searching London up and down for the Doctor. They would get help from all sorts of companions who had been summoned to the area, apparently by the doctor, possibly with a TARDIS blue invitation. I'm talking everyone left who's willing to come back. Maybe even get some invitations to past doctors, probably hoping for 8 and 10 mostly for aging reasons and possibilities. 

Then it turns out they wanted one particular companion who had one particular trait or something, but they called them all to London because they knew they wouldn't have enough time to sort through the memories before the Doctor remembered and came after them.

I'm a leftist and what is this.

If we look at the actions of the state over the last, say, fourteen years, we have the supposedly left populist Labour riding roughshod over civil liberties, being asleep at the wheel for the credit crisis and downturn that followed, and got us involved in one war we shouldn't have been in and one war that has gone massively out of control, all while the wage gap has increased. The new Conservative/Lib Dem government is wanting to increase the privitization of the NHS, has trippled the amount that students will need to pay for university education, and has been asleep at the wheel for the phone hacking scandal. All three parties were guilty of swindling the public on expenses.

If these are the kinds of results the State can deliver, it'd be great if Mr. Moore could explain where this supposed ""blind faith"" comes in. I know I'm speaking anecdotally here but I have always experienced Leftism as being the devils advocate role of politics, challenging pre-conceptions about concentrations of power, and that includes a healty supply of skepticism of the efficiently and personality of ""the State"".

But it's a harder and harder illusion and position to sincerely maintain given the nasty shit our government gets up to (again both domestically and overseas), given our involvement in illegawars, state-sponsored terrorism, rendition, torture, ruthless exploitation etc., and our treatment of the poor and disadvantaged at home (with some of the worst levels of inequality in Europe).",0,1311426880,null,0,true,0,c27g84t,t3_ix0yu,t1_c27g84t,t1_c27fbtf,1427380915,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

I know I'm speaking anecdotally here but I have always experienced Leftism as being the devils advocate role of politics, challenging pre-conceptions about concentrations of power, and that includes a healty supply of skepticism of the efficiently and personality of ""the State"".

So what you are saying is that you openly and strongly identify as a leftist without having a *clue* about what leftist ideology is?

I think it's important that regardless of what I say now you go away and do some thorough research, taken with an analytical, logical and rational approach before you self-identify as anything again.

To put it succinctly and concisely the left - right scale isn't about power and concentrations of it but rather the belief in and respect of individual property rights.  The left at its most extreme has *no respect* of individual property rights, even over yourself and the right at its extreme is happy to see people exert property rights over almost anything and everything.

The dynamic you believe the left is about is actually something you find in both left *and* right ideology and regards power, control and authority.  On the left you have extremes such as Stalinism but also Anarcho-Syndicalists (Catalonia during the Spanish civil war is a good example) and on the right you have Feudalism and what I'd call 'pure' Anarchism.

This is the funny thing really, the left and right in the UK (i.e. Labour and the Conservatives) have traditionally had *far* more in common with each other than they did the Liberals, which is why Labour originally set out to [*destroy* the Liberal party (and they succeeded in doing so) and didn't make *any* dents into the Conservatives](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1f/UK_popular_vote.svg).

true,IPoopedMyPants,null,null,"Hmm... Well, let's see...

Hartnell, well, he was curmudgeonly and was the original Doctor. He made the character interesting and mysterious, but based on his actual episodes and his personality as a Doctor, I probably wouldn't have kept watching the show. I certainly don't think anyone would be talking about it anymore if they didn't introduce the concept of regenerations into the show and ended the series with him. That said, he was very mortal and even... human, as far as Doctors go. The fact that the viewing audience had no idea about regeneration during his reign (as far as I understand it) makes you feel that there are some genuine risks to some of his stories. 

Troughton, well, I absolutely love the guy. If Troughton's Tardis popped into my backyard, I'd hop right into it. He was so much of what the first Doctor wasn't, in that he was fun-loving and silly. A lot of what people attribute to Tom Baker's Doctor could really be considered Baker's following in Troughton's footsteps.

Pertwee was kind of a breed all his own. His version of the Doctor was pretty unique in that he was more of an action hero than a man of science. For a lot of his run, he was ""trapped"" on Earth, but that meant we got a lot more time with Brigadier Lethbridge-Stewart and it also allowed for the scenario that brought Sara Jane into the mix. The Doctor himself was pretty awesome in his own right and he simultaneously reminded me of old action heroes of the 30's-50's and people from the 80's like Hannibal from the A-Team. 

Tom Baker felt like the character was invented for him from his first scene. Even though I absolutely loved Pertwee, Baker was a great new Doctor to have after feeling his loss. He was on for the longest, which means that more people got to see him as their first Doctor. Hell, he was the Doctor for 8 years, so an entire generation really only considers him to be the true Doctor. That said, he certainly played the part brilliantly and he brought the show to what really felt like its peak in terms of popularity. He might not be my #1 Doctor, but he's certainly waaaay up there.

Peter Davison was young and sporty, which was how I thought they were going when they introduced him, but with time, he ended up being a more intellectual Doctor than I had anticipated. I really thought he was fabulous and his portrayal was surprisingly mature. He didn't have the best companions, though. I think that may have made some of his stories  a little less beloved.

Colin Baker came in like a shit-for-brains and went out like a Doctor that I wish I had more of. He was arrogant, self-centered, and almost sophomoric in his mannerisms at first, but his work toward the end of season 23 was  excellent. From what I understand, the powers that be really fucked over his tenure and it showed, but he was still an awesome Doctor in the end.

Sylvester McCoy's Doctor felt genuinely like the Doctor, but he had some really shitty stories, too. Sometimes the ideas were great, but the execution was just horrible. I guess maybe I have an aversion to some of the 80's styles that permeated (a rapping circus ringleader? REALLY?!!), but I really loved his Doctor. His adventures with Ace were really great and they made a hell of a team.

Paul McGann... yeah... I guess he was the 8th Doctor.

Eccleston was Fantastic! Really. His one year was what made me fall in love with Doctor Who. He had such a dynamic range in his acting and it was a shame that he didn't stay on longer.

Tennant is my Doctor. He personifies what I want the Doctor to be. If there's one version of the Doctor that I'd want to meet in real life, it's his, hands down. 

Matt Smith, on the other hand... Well, I didn't really like him at first. I think I was still annoyed at losing my favorite Doctor to some steampunk hipster. That said, I was thinking back a few months ago to an earlier episode that I had loved and my memory had David Tennant as the Doctor. I rewatched it and lo and behold, it was Matt Smith. Matt Smith is one fabulous Doctor who is possibly a better version than I personally deserve. That said, he's the only actor who is younger than I am who has played the role. I will always hold that against him, I guess.  He does feel a bit juvenile, but then again, so did Hartnell at times. 

I wrote that out in the hopes that I could devise a number system at the end. Here goes nothing:

1 - David Tennant  
2 - Peter Davison  
3 - Tom Baker  
4 - Jon Pertwee  
5 - Matt Smith  
6 - Sylvester McCoy  
7 - Patrick Troughton  
8 - Colin Baker  
9 - Wait... I forgot to put Eccleston in here somewhere and he's certainly above Colin Baker... Let's try this another way:

My favorite Doctors in no particular order:

Tennant, Davison, T. Baker, Pertwee, McCoy, Hartnell, Troughton, C. Baker, Eccleston, Smith

McGann

Haha, what? Are you serious? I think you'll find that perch you're sitting on does not give you the insight or authority you think it does. You are very much mistaken if you think I have described anything but a leftist position.

&gt;you go away and do some thorough research

What a sanctimonious, know-it-all statement. I bet the rest of your post follows suit...

&gt;left - right scale isn't about power and concentrations of it but rather the belief in and respect of individual property rights. 

You cannot possibly address the former without serious consideration of the latter. Power concentrations form through the structure of the law; the problems in the world today all share some degree of that structure funneling power and property upwards into the hands of a few, rather than across into the hands of all.

&gt;whereas Liberals are diametrically opposed to both.

Secondly, while you are right that left-wing thought is all about equality you fail to make the connection between equality and property rights.  You *cannot* have a society that is equal without reduced property rights (Wealth redistribution *is* reduced property rights, since wealth is property), otherwise some will inevitably have more than others and the whole situation becomes unequal.

You say that ‘certain theories’ propose reduced property rights, therefore implying some don’t, but the truth of the matter is that all left-wing thought revolves around reduced property rights to achieve equality, ergo left-wing ideology is about the belief that the collective well being of the society are more important than individual property rights.

true,Ivashkin,null,null,"&gt; The Jews survived for centuries, and at times when people (and their rulers) were much less accepting of different religions and cultures. I don't see why it wouldn't be even more the case that today a culture could not integrate but still survive within society.

The history of the Jewish people in Europe was marked with blood libels, expulsions, forced conversions and massacres. Which eventually culminated in Nazi concentration camps and ethnic cleansing. It was hardly thriving, just simply surviving. 

&gt; And the societies that Jews were part of (though always keeping fairly separate within them) usually survived and thrived.

They did, but it wasn't passive. They actively enforced their own standards on ""outsiders"", or made these groups pariahs. They never simply tolerated very different cultures living in their midst.

&gt; If our society can't survive without integrating all the separate cultures within it, that wouldn't make integration right in itself, just something we'd have to try and do if we want our society to survive. (Which we probably do!) But I don't actually buy that it's ever (let alone in these enlightened times) been a requirement for a society to be culturally integrated in order to survive: 

The problem is that today it's entirely possible for an immigrant to travel to the far side of the planet, and end up in a community which is made up of people from their own country. They don't have to integrate with the local population because the immediate local population is culturally identical to the one they left behind, and modern communication and travel means they are not isolated from the country they left. There is no pressure to adapt to the native population. Which is a problem when the native culture and population developed very differently to the one they are from, especially in respect to things like religious freedom or womens rights. Why should be tolerate attitudes to womens rights which are century's behind our own simply because of the ethnic origins of immigrants?

&gt; I struggle to think of an historical example of a society that crumbled or was wiped out due to a lack of integration within it.

The Roman Empire (the western part at least) had huge problems with non-intergrated populations which eventually seized control. The British Empire had the same problems in the colonies (which is why the USA exists), and the USSR had huge issues with this, although it was the Russians who would deport the local population and bring their own people in. Even today in Latvia there are huge problems with ethnic Russians who aren't even considered citizens in the country they were born in.",0,1311443492,null,0,false,0,c27hi94,t3_ix0yu,t1_c27hi94,t1_c27hdha,1427381517,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

* A small culture cannot survive without integrating itself to the larger culture whose society it lives in.

* A society cannot survive without integrating the smaller cultures within it to one culture.

If Jews could survive (and the societies they were in could survive) in periods when it was just not acceptable to not believe in Jesus, surely integration is even less necessary now that our main culture is more tolerant.

&gt; Why should we tolerate attitudes to women's rights which are centuries behind our own simply because of the ethnic origins of immigrants?

We shouldn't; that's why I said other cultures have a right only to *legal* differences from our own culture. No one should be permitted to practice female genital mutilation, but should Jews and Muslims be permitted to circumcise males? If we agree that male circumcision is not harmful and don't have a problem with the fact that a baby can't consent to it (which seems to be the legal position at the moment), then surely we continue to let it happen, even if we (or others) don't agree with the reasons they have for doing it. The only grounds for stopping it would be if it were found to be more harmful than the harm caused by forcibly stopping it.

Your final remark reveals everything we need to know here, you equate liberalism with leftism, which simply isn’t accurate.  So while you may very well be leftist *and* liberal what you actually described as *leftist* was nothing more than a liberal position.

The left-right scale is about economics not societal structure and therefore while leftists do often hold the position and opinions that you expressed in your post *so do rightists*.

Maybe I can make it a bit clearer if I use different terms for a bit, here are the two (extremely broad) scales of political thought:

* - Orange - Blue:  This scale is about economic beliefs and as such regards property rights.
* - Purple - Yellow:  This scale is about social beliefs and as such regards liberty.

People who hold Orange beliefs take the view that all or most property is and should be collectively owned.  Depending on their position on the P/Y scale they will advocate policies ranging from taxation, wealth redistribution policies, state control/run, local commune control/run, public welfare/health/industry et cetera.

A Bluist however holds the position that all or most property is and should be owned by individuals.  Depending on their position on the P/Y scale they will advocate policies ranging from deregulation, removal of taxation and subsidies, laws that protect and enforce individual property rights, free markets et cetera.

A Purplist believes that society needs a single, or minority of authoritative people/institutions to protect people from and prevent evil from occurring.  Depending on their position on the O/B scale they will advocate policies ranging from monopolies on violence, laws about what people can and cannot do/learn/buy &amp; sell et cetera.

People holding Yellowist beliefs take the stance that the respect of individual liberty is the way to protect people from and prevent evil from occurring.  Depending on their position on the O/B scale they will advocate policies ranging from dismantling of monopolies on violence, protection and enforcement of free speech, expression and general life choices that don’t harm other people.

There’s a lot of blur in between but that’s the core beliefs and that’s why I wasn’t addressing the elements together because I was talking about what *all* the leftist theories have in common, not what all the liberal theories have in common or a specific leftist theory.",0,1311447278,null,0,false,0,c27hvsc,t3_ixj6u,t1_c27hvsc,t1_c27h1p3,1427381696,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

I also use TalkTalk and generally they've been very helpful, for example the first router I had from them didn't work at all, but they sent a new one out straight away. However you were unfortunately probably just put through to a Customer Service mook who thought that you had some sort of dispute - not that you were actually trying to help *them*.

I don't work at TalkTalk, but I can probably guess that they're not worried about the scam at all - just as Microsoft wouldn't be (even if you actually got through to the right person to tell - they'd probably just feign interest). There's not a lot they can do to stop these sorts of scammers short of possible costly legal action - which might not even work if the scammers are calling from India. Furthermore, they're not directly involved (someone is just using their name fraudulently) and therefore they feel that any negativity won't reflect on them.

The best you can do is actually write a letter to TalkTalk to ensure that it gets read by the right people so they are made aware of this.

If you look at most shows on British TV, aside from a few shows the BBC makes and some shows on ITV, nobody really gets very good ratings so your basically fighting an uphill struggle to get people to watch your TV show.

That means you need a hell of a show to get a reader or theater goers attention. Another thing is you have to be quite creative because if all your doing is turning a book into a TV show then your basically in trouble.

Our TV shows purposefully avoid treading on the toes of books otherwise they won't get much attention.

The vampires landed on earth, not for its sunlight, but for its abundant water supply. An aquatic race lands on a nearby water planet.  Plus, most of the places the Doctor lands seem to have sunlight similar to Earth, so it was probably a choice of multiple solar irradiated planets, but Earth was closer I imagine and had a city surrounded by water that they could sink and live in.  It also appears that they don't suffer from exposure to sunlight unless it is fairly strong. They came prepared with a weather control machine that kept the city cloudy and seemed to stay to safe areas for the most part.  The girls they had converted to their species also managed to climb around on the roof of a building during daylight hours, so apparently the cloud cover created by the weather machine made it habitable.  The only question I have about that is why Rosanna was able to stand on the docks after the Doctor disabled the weather machine.

If you tell them that your daughter is Buddhist (if you are prepared to lie), it might work to your advantage because there was a Muslim kid at my school who was always cited by R.E. teachers when I kicked off about the school being racist, once I had decided that I was an atheist. So maybe they would jump at the chance to have a token minority as faith schools have, rightly so, been coming under increased criticism  recently.

No, not really. The term was coined in 18th Century France, where those who sat on the left side of the Assembly tended to favour an equal society while those on the right favoured the ruling class heirarchy. Or, [to quote wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left%E2%80%93right_politics)

I pay for a service from TT that apparently, as advertised and advised by them, prevents anonymous and hidden numbers calling my land line number.

The call from ""Talk Talk Microsoft 24/7 PC Maintenance"" came through as their calls do.

I asked to speak to a manager about this and the same lady pretended to be a manager.

I only go on the facts of the matter, like I said I think talk talk itself is a great company (we have been with them for over 10 years, since the days of One-tel), if it is the call centres letting them down then they should know - and their agents prevented me from doing this (by asking that I send in a DPA notice to find out the origin of the call) - this is why I am upset.

Over the years I have put at least 10 people onto their service by recommending TT to my friends, two of which have had this scam, although I am not sure they block anonymous calls etc.

Once again I have never told anyone survey or otherwise who my broadband provider is that could connect me with my telephone number, and once again - I pay for a service which should not have allowed what happened to happen.

Let me sum it up for you:

I pay the network to not allow anonymous / caller ID withheld calls ~£3 p/m. Calls come through from talk talk themselves which when you dial 1471 are withheld ID.

Would it be stereotyping Central America to say that it was hot, or Siberia, when you note that it's cold?  There are humongous substantive differences between the social climates in different nations - how people act and think - even when comparing anglophone countries. 

Britain has a lot going for it. It has history, and people think very deeply... there are a lot of what I would call ""old souls"" in the UK.  However, Brits also seem to have a very confrontative way of addressing the world. Every time I watch political discourse on the BBC, I just think that Britain's all about tooth and claw - whether it's uniting in anger toward the Murdoch papers, or loathing of Islamic terrorism, or whatever. This bitter and quarrelsome attitude even can exhibit itself when members of an arts organization bicker among themselves while producing a new show (I watched a BBC show recently called [""Agony and Ecstasy""](http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00zs817) recently which showed the inside of the making of a new ballet).  It's really disturbing to see this kind of thing, frankly. 

Canada is kind of like the polar opposite of this. If you walk through the series of videos about the events in Oslo and Utoya Island which I linked to, you can see how the journalists get the in-depth stories with a keen sense of portraying factual detail, and not using emotionally loaded kinds of language and speculation. 

Again, I must qualify this by saying some other things.  My best conversations are with Brits, because of their analytical nature. It's wonderful to be around people with whom you can have a deep conversation spanning many different topics over the course of half an hour or so. Also, the BBC is the only television organization that I see as producing material that I feel is worth watching.

I guess what I'm saying is that realistically whilst there hasn't been a drop in the last 40 years there would have to be another huge change in tech to stop us cutting energy consumption in the future.

&gt; 2 Nothing like a real competitive market exists among banks or energy suppliers. They are classic cartels, robbing their customers.

&gt; 4 Insider trading. It’s absolutely endemic. In many spheres and all sorts of ways within the financial world, nothing even approaching a free, fair or open market exists. The protection and enhancement of entrenched advantage is, to a far greater degree than capitalist competition, the key dynamic in many markets.

&gt; 5 The stock exchange has all but lost its original purpose — the financing of new business — and become a turbo-charged, non-stop poker school for a huge, wealthy, essentially unproductive and largely parasitic class. Unfortunately for my argument, Britain makes a lot of money from this.

&gt; 6 Which goes for another financial story. The slow, centuries-old corruption by greed of the insurance principle. Insurance has become an almighty racket, with millions of naive citizens parted from billions by the unscrupulous sale, often under the guise of independent, best-interests advice, of almost worthless policies. Most — not all — insurance is a con, in which thousands of middlemen collude as agents.

&gt; 7 The policing of the criminal law is riddled with corruption. The Crown Prosecution Service and the police, not statute, are the real determinant of punishable behaviour. Wide discretion has to be exercised in selecting the tiny minority against whom proceedings are taken. If money has been accepted by corrupt Met officers from the one media corporation on which the spotlight falls today, how many more officers in how many other forces have accepted, and are still accepting, and from whom, how much more in exchange for who can say what?

&gt; 8 This goes for the Crown Prosecution Service too.

&gt; 9 The easing of credit that ministers are now pushing so hard, coupled with bizarrely low interest rates, will — as we speak — be drawing millions of our countrymen into debts and mortgages that will strangle them when interest rates rise.

&gt; 11The way that British ministers and mandarins can proceed, within a few years of retirement, to take up positions on the boards of companies in the fields that they have until recently supervised is an absolute disgrace. We’re not talking shades of grey here. It’s outrageous.

&gt; 12 So is the “government-relations” lobbying industry. We are heading for an American situation in which a whole class of expensive leeches interpose themselves between the government and the citizen.

&gt; 13 The social services departments of local authorities are an incompetent and occasionally vicious element in public administration, particularly as regards child protection.

&gt; 14 The way children get allocated to state schools is indefensible, and a huge anxiety to parents.

&gt; 15 The public sector is chronically incapable even of understanding, let alone managing, large IT projects; and private sector contractors are guilty of daylight robbery.

&gt; 16 When all is told there will have been some shocking war crimes in Afghanistan. A purpose of war is to kill people. This has been a horrendous experience for many servicemen. Normal human sensibilities will have been degraded. Awful things will have happened and been “covered up”.

So he's essentially conceding (a large part of) the (left) libertarian case, whilst seeking to downplay it by saying it's an open secret.  He's also disingenuous enough to suggest that ""Britain"" makes a lot of money from it.  Certain individuals do for sure, but to do so they comrehensively screw the rest of us.

&gt;19 Lawyers. This is a coming storm — coming, I do hope, in my lifetime. MPs have bitten journalists; journalists have bitten MPs; now judges, who hate the media, are about to bite journalists. Sooner or later comes biteback time. That the practice of law in England has for centuries been a stitch-up to enrich a professional monopoly at vast public and private expense is perfectly well known — not least by lawyers, who subliminally know that theirs is not quite a gentleman’s calling. Hence their rather desperate pomposity and self-regard. It must crack.

true,bluefold,null,null,"A lot of what people have said already is true. There is a lot of funding from various places with the BBC being allowed to risk it on slightly out there shows. But again as others have said there is a lot of rubbish out there to get the ratings that are staples, like Eastenders and Coronation Streets - When you have these kind of shows that a guaranteed to get decent ratings it allows you to take a little pressure off as they cover other shows with advertising revenue etc

There is also a culture of story here. Look at The Office or similar shows, they are allowed to end. I have a lot of love for the American office and they have done brilliant things with it but you can fit the entire British office into one season of the American one. 

However the biggest plus is the promotion of new writing. While it is not easy to break into the industry there are lots of roots into it. The BBC writers room continuously looks for new writing talent to bring fresh voices into its main core of shows (Eastenders, Casualty etc) but the only way you can get read is by writing something original. This more than anything shows the difference in cultures to me. In America it is all about writing for Spec (at least on TV) You have a set of scripts where you are trying to write an episode of Lost or Arrested Development to show you can mimic the shows style and therefore cater to the viewers. But at least with the BBC they are more interested in seeing talent and then teaching you the skills you need to write for an established show afterwards.

That is not to say other countries don't have good shows, there is a bunch of Canadian TV, ReGenesis, Flashpoint, that is really stand out and then you have Spirals in France which is a great show as well. I am sure there are other shows out there equally as good but simply people have not heard of them but the thing all these have in common is they are not trying to be an American show in France. 

tl;dr TV is best when the culture has the freedom to express itself. If you are constricted by trying to be a British show made by Germans it does not work. If you invest in shows that cater for your population you get gems like IT Crowd and QI but it is far too tempting to go Oooh, that is big in Britain lets make a copy of it or this show gets the ratings lets make more like it but with a slight difference.

I grew up watching Monty Python on ORF2, after midnight, luckily with original sound and with subtitles, this was within a ""culture programming"". They showed it very late, not many other people saw it I guess, but it got me hooked.

Now I'm a programmer and can work the internet pretty well so I confess that I download a lot of TV, mostly UK and US TV shows. After seeing the original I cannot and will not go back to watching translated 3 year old episodes.

Most of my family have a very different story. They never got into English speaking programs, and I am having a hard time convincing them to try and watch Doctor Who for example. It's a lost cause with them, they rather watch anything translated or the boring native shows.

Stuff sounds better in English, be it songs, tv or be it books, I prefer English literature to German one in 90 of 100 cases.

The EU budget is actually pretty efficient, especially when compared to the budget of federal governments such as the USA, India, Russia etc.  For example, only 5.4% of a budget of 126.5 billion Euros in 2007 (Which is in total only 1.2% of EU GDP) went on admin costs for the Union.

The weight of 'meeting the target' is so inflexible to demands that service in many regards is hindered by it, and then you have to explain why you're not meeting these targets as if you've done something wrong.

I feel layers of management should be replaced with people willing to evaluate performance instead of having statistics. I for one would prefer someone who worked 75% as fast as everyone else but never made mistakes. Targets unfortunately do not allow for this approach. Quality is unfortunately turned into quantitative statistics rather than a qualitative approach assessing performance.

I think if managers were held more responsible for staff performance and targets were removed and staff of all organisations were assessed on their own productivity and their own strengths, a lot of public sector inefficiency would be removed.

This is purely an opinion statement.   There were several who liked him as much as several who did not.  And that applies to just about every character in the show.  There are several who do not like Matt in the role and those who do not like Amy.  If the BBC really thought people didn't like him so much that they would not put him on press tours, they would probably ask for him to be removed from the show altogether. 

The more likely excuse is that it's expensive to send people out on press tours and it's common to use the top billing stars of your show.  The Doctor and Amy are the real stars of the show.  Arthur didn't get his name in the opening credits until series 6.  

Also, he may not have as dynamic a personality as Matt and Karen.  He comes off a bit strange in interviews, so from a business perspective, he is not the best representative for the show.  He doesn't exude excitement like the other two.

To get over addiction you need to accept you are addicted, and only you can make the decision. That you're not powerless against it, and it's only a decision you repeatedly get wrong. 

That's why the step programs in America are flawed, and it's why so many addicts - drugs, alcohol, etc - will never be 'cured' because they have managed to turn their addiction into a separate personality.

Winehouse got all the help it was possible for someone to get, and she still fucked herself up. It's a tragic waste of her talent, but probably since it's clear she was incapable of accepting help when offered it was inevitable, and seems to have come at the right point in her career. Her comeback had failed miserably when she was unable to be sober enough to even sing along to her songs.

It makes me rather angry when all these celebrities come out saying how upset they are that their friend lost a fight against the addiction. That kind of language is what leads to people continuing to be addicted.

Does anyone else remember the episode of *Nevermind the Buzzcocks* Amy Winehouse was on? 

You know how *Buzzcocks* has that section where a bunch of people stand in a line and the panelists try to identify the minor pop star in the lineup? While they're doing this they typically insult the people in the lineup. Usually the insults focus on the people's looks. The people -- presumably as per their contract -- simply have to stand there and try not to make any kind of facial expression as they receive the insults.

When Stephen Fry was on it, and they reached that round, he said something like ""I always find the things the panelists say to the lineup so mean...but now I'm here, with those people in front of me, I see how hard it is to resist!"" Then, I think, he went on to make some wittily cutting observations about the people, in a faux-regretful way. Ever since then I've liked Stephen Fry a little less.

When Amy Winehouse a panelist on *Buzzcocks*, and the lineup of people round was reached, the usual insults were delivered by the other panelists. I don't recall Ms. Winehouse joining in. The insults began to focus on one particular person, and after a little while of this, Ms. Winehouse got up, went up to this person, and hugged them. Ever since then I liked her a little more.

I'd always slightly admired or at least approved of her for being -- unusually for a woman -- a proper crazy drunk unhappy rock star; and this in an era when most male rock stars seem more like professional careerists than the unhinged artists they're meant to be.

You are prepared to be part of the problem, and not the solution. Faith based schools are something we should have left behind in the 20th century.

But we still allow them, so it's up to them if they accept non religious kids. 

The reason why they still exist is **not** because of religious parents, it's because of apathetic parents who don't give a stuff about the religious thing, but want their kids to go to a good school - and are prepared to prop up religious schools as a result.

Edit : I don't really mean that. I do want them to end, and I do blame it on apathy. But I also understand why people aren't willing to sacrifice their kids education in order to make a point.

There's a very wrong way to deal with addicition and that's what the spiritual/god/demon/blame/entity way is. It's a hand wringing way to take the blame from people we love and put it on something else. Parents, family, friends etc can't bring themselves to hate the people who are addicted, so instead they pass it on to the substance they are addicted to. It does seem natural to do it that way, it seems compassionate, and it seems to explain things. But it's not the solution.

I've given up 4 major addictions in my life. The difficult part was deciding to give them up, once that was done it was easy to follow through. People who will fail to give up on something are the ones who mish mash about with things like ""If I'm strong enough"" ""I hope I have the strength"" ""I'll try my best"". Balls.

[This video isn't particularly skewed one way or the other, but explains the different types and how we shouldn't try and draw a line between the sexes.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=98f3IavuEgQ)

It's really a very troubling disconnect that people have in their heads. All the arguments that are given for male circumcision have direct analogies to justify female circumcision. The people who perform FC think it's ""ok"" in exactly the same way people who do MC think *that's* ""ok"". Even women who've had it done to them (not all, obviously).

With regards to not thinking male circumcision is brutal: [watch a video of a circumcsion](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXVFFI76ff0&amp;feature=player_detailpage#t=273s) - NSFW (Child nudity &amp; surgery). Then consider the stats concerning how many circumcisions result in deformity etc.

Then consider whether or not it is moral or ethical to remove part of someone's body without their say so.",0,1311540165,null,0,false,0,c27ooss,t3_ix0yu,t1_c27ooss,t1_c27gczk,1427384965,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

The Netherlands and Belgium are just as crowded as Japan or Taiwan, but nobody says Japan or Taiwan will solve this RACE problem by bringing in millions of third worlders and quote assimilating unquote with them.

Everybody says the final solution to this RACE problem is for EVERY white country and ONLY white countries to “assimilate,” i.e., intermarry, with all those non-whites.

true,DrunkenTypist,eng-devon,The Mild West,"I seriously do not understand why people are getting outraged about this. Is it because the understanding of the word 'cartoon' has changed; people think it only means some kind of Disney, The Simpsons kind of funny?

Editorial cartoons come from a very long line of satire and use this medium to draw upon complex and well understood ideas to briefly, immediately connect a whole bunch of notions together and require a bit of thinking, cultural knowledge of the image that is being used and frankly intelligence. 

I suspect the majority of people posting here just think of the painting as some Warhol-like pop-art (not that there is anything wrong with that and Warhol and his ilk also provide a biting cultural commentary) when it is not.

The painting [The Scream](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Scream) has a very particular meaning as far as Edvard Munch was concerned. It is (I thought a well known) fact that he had a particular mental disturbance at the time of this painting - depersonalisation disorder - something that affects one's sense of the environment, one's self and the relation to it the realisation of which evoked the panicked scream - like a very real nightmare if you will.

Only a fool can think that Norway, in the days after this terrible event, is not undergoing a huge reappraisal of itself - a relatively small country, well off, remote from the horrible things that go on in the world in many ways, dealing with changes brought by the increasing contact with different cultures that the past 20-30 years have brought - in short a huge upheaval of what they thought they were and how things are.

The use of this image in this cartoon is extremely apt, is not some sinister reptile plot to heap misery on a nation, or distract from issues close to home etc etc.

Downvote away - but please ensure you explain why. The knee-jerk ignorance here, of art, culture, satire - things that have been taken for granted in educated Western Europe since the fucking Ancient Greeks makes me despair. Clearly the education system of the UK is in the shitter - is it really all about certificates and nothing about wider knowledge and learning? Fuck this...

As events unfolded, more reputable outlets expressed a lack of knowledge of what was going on, but tried to examine possibilities. With the initial bomb, one explanation that seemed likely was Libyan state terrorism. Then an Islamic extremist group tried to claim responsibility. I'm aware of far right views and groups in Europe and that still seemed possible. These were things mentioned on the BBC at least early on at the time. 24 hour coverage unfortunately requires people to endlessly speculate, whereas years ago these things would filter. Lesser quality outlets rushed to judgement. I cannot state their motives. I can guess.

My first thoughts that this was far right activity was when I heard a witness talk of the smell of sulphur. That made me think of a fertilizer bomb and then Oklahoma.

I actually think he did act alone, but his thoughts were backed by groups he came into contact with. It seems more likely this was a warped individual that had not only political motives, but was led to this through [personal psychological background also](http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/feedarticle/9761903). That does not make him a lone exception, only he acted alone. The London nail bomber was a loner but definitely had his views and extremism backed up. Nor does this not make him a terrorist. He most certainly is. In much the same way there are Al-Qaeda  operatives, these people work on a franchised idea acting outside of organisation backed by the sources they accept.

 Now, the aliens were hiding in the skins of the politicians they impersonated -  After the meat industry butchers the animals, their skins are sold to make leather and other goods. one of the most famous uses for a pig's skin is to make american footballs (also known as pigskins.

true,abw,cnty-uk,Surrey,"&gt; what I can do to avoid being an obnoxious American.

What makes *some* American tourists obnoxious is the fact that they are entirely oblivious to the fact that other countries have different cultural norms to their own.  The continue to behave in a thoroughly American way and complain when the rest of the world doesn't follow suit.

The fact that you are aware of, and concerned about the fact that you might appear obnoxious, suggests to me that you're going to do just fine.  The UK, and its universities in particular, are very cosmopolitan places.  As long as you're prepared to ""mix in"" and embrace the cross-cultural experience (and it sounds like you will) then you'll have no problem.

It's worth remembering that UK English and US English are different languages.  Nearly everyone in the UK speaks fluent American from watching telly (TV) and going to the pictures (movie theater) so you'll have no problem being understood.  But it'll make a good impression if you try and learn some of the local language.  

For example, say ""**rubbish**"" instead of ""**trash**"" and ""**bin**"" instead of ""**trash can**"" (e.g. put your rubbish in the bin).  Say ""**mate**"" instead of ""**buddy**"" (if you don't say ""buddy"", then just add it onto everything you say when talking to a fellow male (I'm assuming you are male - apologies if not), e.g. ""Thanks, mate"", ""Do you fancy a pint, mate?"", ""There you go, mate"", ""No problem, mate"").  Use ""*well*"" as a superlative, e.g. ""I'm well happy"", ""I was well pissed"", ""She's well fit"".  If you don't believe someone, the correct response is ""Are you having a laugh?"".

If you really want to blend in like a natural Brit then you'll have to get your swearing sorted.  Use ""**wanker**"" as a general insult to other males, but not to their faces unless you're spoiling for a fight, e.g. ""He was being a bit of a wanker"" or ""What a complete wanker"".  A good single word insult is ""**twat**"" (technically a slang name for a vagina, but close enough to ""**twit**"" to be considered quite mild and slightly comical).  As in the US, ""**cunt**"" is the most offensive word you can utter, particularly in the company of women.  However, among male friends, you can bandy it around like a silly old cunt all day long and not an eyelid will be batted.

Best of luck, mate!

This should not be used as an excuse to whitewash or bury hard arguments, if we want to defeat this ideological illness we need to stand up and say 'yes, the world is changing' and we need to be clear that we understand the dangers and complications of this, we need to make sure people like this fool can see that society needs to change, that the old world was every bit as imperfect as today's, often more so - society needs to work together, to look for solutions; trying to hold back the tide of progress is simply silly.
  
This doesn't just go for the murderers of this world, the maniacs and terrorists are easy to detest but also look at how this dream of a 'return' to an impossibly perfect pseudo-history is causing problems all over the place - from the american debt debate right through Belgium bi-separatism, Broken Britain and all the other sticking points of the western political sphere.  I'm not just saying this as a progressive leftist attacking the right because we're just as bad as them at avoiding the question and presuming answers, it's this attitude which causes such a deep division.  
  
Everything gets bundled together and it's Royalist Racist Nazi Christians Vs Progressive Marxist Multiculturalist Babyeaters - the other side is always deluded, always sheepish and they're always secretly working to undermine and destroy everything good in the world.  
  
Well, let's try and move past that - let's try and be rational about things, lets try to keep things in context without running off to absurdisms -  lets look for data and logic in things rather than for iding demons, lets not use  as an excuse to hide from the things the guy raises instead lets it be a reason to disprove those he's wrong on and solve any that are valid using sensible and considered ways.

I would say that the police do need to do more with low level ASB cases, as that seems to be where the majority of people have issues with the police. And the policing of public disorder probably needs some attention. The oversight issue is another area they need work on, but this is far broader than simply hiring people.

Mainly, although we are concentrating on using ex-army officers for the police, the issue is broader than that as the proposals are talking about fast tracking people into a variety of civil service rolls, and bringing in foreigners for these roles. If you look at government procurement there are huge issues with the contracts we sign, mainly because the people who sign them have got to that position because they've been in the service for long enough to get promoted to that point and don't appear to understand how contracts are written today.

The Express goes without saying.

The Independent(usually my preferred paper) had a front page article analysing the life and manifesto of the mass murderer, full of photos of him. **Absolutely** the worst thing to do.

The Guardian switched its front page headline to the far-right in the UK on Sunday. I suppose it can be forgiven, but I find it annoying they ran that on Sunday. Its so insular and inward-looking when the real story that day was just how bad the terror attack had been, not any tenuous links with the EDL etc. Bearing in mind they ran this story on *Sunday*. That article wouldn't have been too bad on the Monday, but the Sunday is just ridiculous.

The Times is actually pretty good. Doesn't look like they implied it was Islamists anywhere and it has no photos of the guy. The final article is perhaps a bit extreme, but maybe not as bad as the Guardian. Shrug. Looks pretty good to me.

The Mail doesn't run the story at first, and then it goes full out on reporting on the individual. Terrible.

The Telegraph runs good coverage on Friday and Saturday. On Sunday it runs a not-outrageous article about how the Met are investigating potential British links. Its not overblown and it doesn't have massive photos of the cunt plastered over the front page. Basically similar to the Guardian except its not over the top and that they waiting until Monday.

The Star is just lulz.

The Sun is terrible.

The Mirror is retarded.

So yeah, the Telegraph surprisingly comes out with the best coverage (from a front page perspective) for me, with the Times a good second. Guardian not too bad with a third. The Independent seriously disappointed me.

FYI I actually generally read the Independent and the Guardian. They're both disappointing really. Independent needs to learn to not plaster its front page with photos and expose of the killers life and the Guardian needs to fucking report the story, not attack its typical bogey men groups when they'd only just found out the true scale of the massacre.",0,1311599102,null,0,true,0,c27t6uk,t3_iz0kh,t1_c27t6uk,t3_iz0kh,1427391050,19,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,19

When? In 1919? 

My point is that what you clearly in your mind as a black v white situation never has been. The people we call Scots originated as an Irish tribe that took lands in Scotland. The east of Ulster was effectively link to the West of Scotland through much of our recent history. Many Scots migrated (back?) to Ireland during the plantations.
These scottish people played a large part in the wars between the Irish and the British (Scots, English and Welsh). Many Irish people also identified as being British (read up on the people active in extending the Empire - many were Irish, Scots or Welsh). 

The point I'm trying to make is that it is as complex as anything the Balkans have managed to come up with and reducing it to English v Irish is plain bollocks.

That doesn't mean he shouldn't be punished for his actions, of course.  
But I always am bothered when people say, ""He's not mentally ill, he's just a bad man"". There's no such thing as bad men. There are simply victims of circumstance.  
Such is this mans tragic fate to kill and to be punished for it, but at no point in his life did he ever truly choose this fate.  
The desirable future is a world where this is understood by all, and where this understanding is incorporated into our systems of punishment and our every day perspective.  
A man with the capacity to kill is a broken man, same as any other disability. It may be that he is unable to function within the rules we've established as a civilization, and so must be removed from it. That is a *shame* and *tragedy*. We have people born into this world, who we as a people are not prepared to accommodate and to help. That is a fault with humanity as a whole; the blame can't be attributed to the victims themselves.  
It's unfortunate that this man's circumstance led him on this path, and there was no one there to right his damaged perspective.   
People want to see him in pain, and people want vengeance.  
To me this is kicking a man when he's down.  
If he *must* be put down, then he must be, but it's not justice; it's necessity. Nobody wins... It's one more victim and one more tragedy on the already formidable pile.

My point, however, was that Dalglish was clear that the team is actually thin on depth and did not want any extra distractions. 

I don't consider Ngog as a suitable back-up, so Liverpool only has 3 strikers. Kuyt, Carroll, Suarez. And Suarez will be coming back late after the Copa America. 

In midfield, Liverpool essentially only has Maxi, Gerrard, Meireles, Aquilani, Lucas, Henderson and Adam. Henderson and Adam are new, while it is still unknown if Aquilani figures in the team. That means that Dalglish had only 4 midfielders he could more or less trust by the end of the season. 

In defense, we have 4 CBs (Skrtel, Agger, Carra, Kyrgiakos), which is barely enough. We have Johnson, who can play RB or LB, Kelly who can play RB or CB, and a bunch of youngsters including Insua. 

If you look at things in this way, you can guess why Dalglish would not have wanted to play more matches than absolutely necessary at the end of last season. There was no guarantee that the transfer targets like Henderson, Adam and Downing would be successful. The team was woefully inadequate for even a Top 4 finish, let alone put a Europa League on top of things. 

The only reason why the team looks like it has depth now is due to the sheer number of un-needed midfielders we have now.

1st I lived in Kingscross - only stayed 3 months, avoid like the plague.

Then off to live in Hampstead - lovely area, low crime, but very expensive, I was paying around £400/month for a small bedsit - but I only had a 5 min walk to work.

Then moved to Burnt Oak, which is almost at the end of the Northern Line - next to Edgware.  Not a great area although I never had any trouble, payed about the same as living in Hampstead but I had a 1 bed flat and a small garden.  I would have stayed there if my landlord hadn't died but his family wanted to sell the house.

Next moved to Edmonton - DO NOT LIVE HERE!
Edmonton/Enfield are a total shithole, I never felt safe on the streets after dark in the area I was in was victim of attempted mugging 3 times in the 4 years I lived there (I was super fit at the time and have been doing martial arts since I was 8 so some weedy twat with a penknife wasn't going to steal my shit lol).

Those are the places I have 1st hand knowlede of - all in North London.

Camden - great place to drink, not so great a place to live.

I have a friend that lives in Richmond, quite a nice area.  Rents aren't too cheap but you can find some nice affordable places.

Work colleague lived in Southall - definately avoid, very high crime rate.

I only lived in North London so Ill list what I think of various areas around there.

**good places** would be: Swiss Cottage, Hampstead, Belsize Park, West Hampstead, Finchley, Islington, Hendon.

""**OK**"" places: Chalk Farm, Kentish Town, Burnt Oak, Edgware, Ladbroke Grove, Barnet.

**places to avoid**, Willesden, Harlesden, Seven Sisters, Tottenham, Edmonton, Enfield, Kilburn, Kings Cross,

In fact, you're looking at £850-£900 for somewhere livable in those areas, unless you are very lucky.

If you can stomach a shared kitchen/bathroom, you can go cheaper, but £700pm is still pretty low on rent. For £600pm you'd be able to find a crappy flatshare, and for £500pm you could find a crappy flatshare out of the way.

I would seriously suggest not living alone; you won't pay half council tax, for instance, and £500pm is perfectly reasonable per person in a two- or three-bed flat. Do you have any mates you can move in with? Otherwise, flatshare is your option. I decided against it, and I'm moving my younger brother in and covering half his rent.

Wandsworth is cheapest council tax, I don't really know about the others, it's pretty random.

I would assume so. It was an inalterable eventuality of a series of events set into motion forever ago. 

&gt;Is whether or not I take a drink tonight, tomorrow, next year a choice, or somehow only the product of my upbringing?  
  
Partially... It's a product of your environment (upbringing), and your genetic code. You start with your unique genetic code, then the code responds to external stimuli (your environment) in a manner determined by your genes, and that's your life. The incredibly complex interactions between environment and genetic programming gives the illusion of choice.  
You only need look at a simpler organism to see this at a more easily understood scale. You wouldn't say a single-celled organism can make choices... It doesn't even have a brain. But it certainly can give the appearance of making choices when you affect it's environment. If you put an object in it's way it could turn around, or it could go around it. There is no choice involved, only a pre-programmed response based on genetic code.  
Add a couple billion years of evolution and additional complexity, and the illusion of choice becomes very convincing.  
We are incredibly complex organisms interacting with other incredibly complex organisms in exponentially complex environments. It's easy to look at this scene and see randomness and free-will, but if we had a brain with a billion times the processing power, maybe we would see that it's just the execution and resolution of a ridiculously complex mathematical problem based on genetic code.  
Of course that's just my opinion, but it's the only logical perspective I see. Free will just doesn't fit into the scientific universe as far as I can tell.  
&gt;the overall sense you get from people who cheat, or lie, or steal, is 'I wanted to and thought I would get away with it'. They don't claim to be predetermined to cheat. They made a choice to do it based on weighing consequences and chances of getting caught.  
  
They *had* to make that choice the way they did. You and I are lucky to be born with the capacity to make the ""right"" choices. What choice we make is *clearly* dependent on our brains, and our brains are dependent on our genes. The choice someone makes can be blamed on the way their brain responds to a problem. The way their brain responds to a problem can be blamed on the genetic code that formed that brain (and any additional external input). But at no point can someone make a decision *free* of the influence of their genes or their brain.

And, with reference to the more minor side of the Hari scandal, I always wanted someone to take a random sample of Hari interviews and find out how many of the words came from other sources, and then take a random sample of a bunch of other journalists' interviews and do the same thing. It's probably the sort of thing that could be programmed and thus use a large sample set. I would have tried it myself if I weren't catastrophically lazy.

In the Hari piece the impression given by the first 5 paragraphs is that he has done some research and come across a particular case which he then reports as though he, Hari, has read the court reports and précised what was there; this he then uses as a launch pad for his opinion piece. This is misleading (and it is wrong, make no mistake about it). If you read the *Der Spiegel* piece it is clear the reporter was actually there - gave direct quotes (in inverted commas), and where they got information from other sources - named them ie *Die Tageszeitung* and *Bild*.

Hari should have clearly referenced the article in *Der Spiegel*; he does mention a couple of facts from the paper but again not really referencing the actual article. Further down he mentions a ruling by a court in Westphalia - again, the information regarding this was taken from the *Der Spiegel* article without acknowledgement giving the impression that Hari had spent time researching court records in Germany - this is taking credit for someone else's work by which he actually financially benefited.

As someone pointed out above, there is more in Private Eye concerning a piece he also submitted to the Orwell panel regarding the Central African Republic where he blatantly made things up much to the irritation of the charity he had blagged into providing him with free translation services. The charity complained to the Independent but were ignored (what message would Hari have got from that I wonder, that his lying was okay?).

Look, I feel sorry for the guy and I hope he can bounce back because when he is writing opinion pieces (as opposed to journalism) he is a good writer.

true,koltra,null,null,"I think what Hari did was wrong, hence my saying that I'm not defending him (twice!), but I don't think you should establish that he committed plagiarism by showing that what he did would be unacceptable from an undergrad. There are very many articles that are perfectly acceptable journalism but that would not do enough to be regarded as unplagiarised if they were in an academic context. One way to see this is the case is to compare an article by George Monbiot [as it appears on his website](http://www.monbiot.com/2011/07/04/corporate-power-no-thanks/), with 13 references, to [how it appears on the Guardian's website](http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2011/jul/04/nuclear-industry-stinks-cleaner-energy) with most of the references removed. The first might pass academic muster (so far as plagiarism is concerned): the second never would. Presumably when it appeared in print the article had no reference whatsoever to where, for instance, Monbiot got the idea of (or the figures for) comparing deaths per year due to coal-fired plants to deaths per year due to nuclear plants. Most journalists don't provide a referenced version of their article anywhere (and Monbiot appears to reference them for fact-checking purposes, rather than out of a desire to avoid a charge of plagiarism), so for this and other reasons, their columns would be plagiarism if they were in an academic context.

But neither of these pages says that the Boeshane Peninsula is within the Isop Galaxy or a part of the Silver Devastation.
Both of those are included because of the two working theories.

But if these two bits of information from the wikis for each are taken as 'canon' [I know how we hate that word], then it might make sense: ""It containing blood-sucking monsters from another universe"" [from Silver Devastation]; ""Most of the inhabitants were killed when the 'most horrible creatures imaginable' invaded the Peninsula"" [from Boeshane Peninsula].

Anyway, I always thought that Jack was the Face of Boe because of his statement to the Doctor.

I was just giving arguments I've heard against it because the fact that Jack = the Face of Boe is not definitive, and RTD has claimed that he may still kill off Jack in Torchwood. I don't watch the show, so I don't know about any references to it they've made there, but if he did die in Torchwood, prior to becoming the Face of Boe, that'd be pretty definitive evidence that he ISN'T the Face of Boe.",0,1311624903,null,0,false,0,c27w0p5,t3_iykdq,t1_c27w0p5,t1_c27t937,1427392376,1,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,1

Entirely reasonable to expect that Monbiot is going to be one-eyed about his interests and selective as to which sources he uses (and to read them in the light of that expectation) - absolutely not the case with a journalist.

When Hari is writing one his polemical/colour pieces, I expect that there will be a bias in what is there, a variety of facts, opinions plucked from here and there etc etc - it is up to me to decide whether to read further or to take what he says as an opportunity to look at things in a different light and read from there. 

However, the pieces that he has got into trouble for (not the interviews - as I said earlier I don't think that this was some deadly sin; he should perhaps have made it clear that he was using sources outside of the direct face to face interview) were very much under the guise of journalistic reportage and therefore there are standards that should be adhered to.

That's my point. This is okay to do in journalism but not okay to do in academic writing, so to say someone's writing qualifies as plagiarism because it doesn't meet the plagiarism standards of academic writing is silly.

I only chose Monbiot because I already knew he references his articles, and it would be difficult to find a more straightforward piece of journalism and try to break it down into its sources myself: other articles, AP, Reuters, an interpretation of certain facts the journalist read in a book about what he's writing about, geographical details about Utøya the journalist looked up on Wikipedia, etc. But I think lots of journalism would rely from such sources, often uncredited.

I don't really think of his Spiegel-esque Orwell piece as straightforward reportage (I mean it's filed under 'opinion' on the Indy's website) but it's still pretty unacceptable, and it does contain straightforward facts stolen and embellished.",0,1311626371,null,0,false,0,c27w833,t3_iz5xt,t1_c27w833,t1_c27w1of,1427392474,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

From a product looked up, you could grab the competitor price.  You could infer that the products that are looked up the most, are those that the customers are more price conscious of.  

A store now has the potential to crowd source competitor prices, for the key products where price matters to its core customers.  

If your business is built on concept of everyday low prices, then I'd imagine you'd spend a significant amount of money already gathering this data. For the price of a little bandwidth the market research value alone could pay for this.

I'm not suggesting this is what Tesco intend to do, (implied or not).   Just some of my wild thoughts on value of this service to a store.  Tracking customers in the above manner would get nothing but bad press, something a company like Tesco are sure to be aware of.

It's his choice to make, of course, whether he uses his name or not but it's very basic journalism to publish his name. Of course, Brooker's stuff is not journalism, it's opinion. And his opinion seems to be to ignore these people. I don't think that is very intelligent.

It's reasonable to put that notion further to the right than conservatives.

A big part of the turnaround in our fates last year was due to a sudden boost in morale. King Kenny came back, which rejuvenated both fans and players. Suarez and Carroll joined for almost 60 million, which was a strong signal of intent from the new owners. Suarez's form was also a big bonus. 

This time round, we can't rely on these anymore. The owners have gone from being willing to spend, to being borderline spendthrifts. (public opinion, not mine.) All the new transfers need to prove their worth. Dalglish must work more on tactics than on the wave of optimism upon his initial appointment. Most importantly, Suarez hardly played for Ajax in the first half of the season before joining us. After joining us, he had plenty of chances to regain his fitness because he was cup-tied for the Europa League. This year, Suarez will be coming off a gruelling Copa America campaign. The difference is huge.

* Firstly, our deficit stands at around £140B, which is more than we are spending on healthcare. The interest on our debt is £43B.

* Our population is getting older.

* Medical treatment is getting more expensive, especially when it comes to drugs and the cutting edge treatments for things like cancer.

So given that, we face a problem. It's clear that we need to spend more on our health service, if you look at other nations they are spending around 10% of GDP on healthcare, and we are spending 7%. Anecdotal, I've been waiting 2 years for treatment for a pilonidal sinus, I was referred to a surgeon in January and I'm still waiting for an operation. My fathers heart problems were put on a wait list under the NHS, but he got treatment almost instantly under the French system. And getting an NHS dentist is almost impossible in some places, my GF's been told she has to wait 2-3 months before she can see one.

But with a deficit like the one we have, and interest payments on our debt taking an ever larger amount of our public spending, we cannot just increase funding to the NHS to the level required. We need to look at other ways of spreading the cost about. People want a faster service, with reduced waiting times, access to better care, and more choice about the services we get.

Half the problem with NHS reforms is that you cannot talk seriously about them. The usual suspects in the press will start making a noise about how any change is nothing short of a wholesale destruction of the service, and than how poor people will have to sell their organs for flu shots. This means that any changes are some good ideas buried under a mountain of compromise and fudging. Which means than no one can make any radical changes to the NHS.

While the TARDIS can travel through space (3rd dimension) and time (4th dimension), adding a forth dimension would not explain the size difference.

The reason that the TARDIS experiences [non-Euclidian geometry](http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-Euclidean_geometry) is because of how the TARDIS exists at any give time, not through time. 

[First:](http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/TARDIS)

&gt;A TARDIS usually travels by dematerializing in one spot, traversing the time vortex, and then rematerialising at its destination, without physically travelling through the intervening space. 

This is an important concept to remember. The TARDIS does not need to move anywhere in the 3 dimensions to appear somewhere else, 

While Wikipedia explains that the inside and outside appear in separate dimensions, quoting from the series, ""dimensionally transcendental"", this is a misleading explanation. The inside isn't bigger because it exists in 4 dimensional space. It also exists on 3 dimensional space, because that is the only way in which the characters could effectively interact with it.

To give an example from your analogy, a 2 dimensional creature could only experience a cross section of a 3 dimensional object as it crossed through the same plane as it's dimension. We who experience 3 dimensions, though we move through the 4th dimension during the course of our lives, cannot experience a dimension outside of the 3 we are in during any moment in the 4th as it passes through us (or we through it).

So, a less misleading description than that the inside and outside exist in separate dimensions is that the separate dimensions (the conflicting xyz) of the TARDIS exist in separate areas of space. 

This makes more sense when you consider that:

&gt;Although the true weight of the TARDIS is many tons – Romana says 50,000 in *Full Circle*- its external form can be moved about e.g. transported on a lorry.

Being able to travel through 4 dimensions makes it possible for the inside to exist in a separate space than the outside.

This seems to be further confirmed when considering how the heart of the TARDIS is powered.

&gt;They draw their power from several sources, but primarily from the singularity of an artificial black hole, known as the Eye of Harmony. 

This expresses a link to a different position in the 4th dimension (the black hole, during any period of time) than the current position of the TARDIS.

This ability to have the inside and outside exist at any point in the 4th dimension (even within another TARDIS that it is also simultaneously inside of it) allows the TARDIS to exist in 2 different 3 dimensional spaces. Using the TARDIS's ability to travel through 4 dimensions allows it to form areas for it's inner area to exist in, shown in how the doctor can delete rooms, or how the TARDIS can (as in The Eleventh Hour) rebuild and reconfigure itself. The way it's computers control the rooms of the ship seems then similar to how one could use programs control a virtual world (note how a virtual world doesn't exactly exist in a 3 dimensional space, then consider how computers that manipulate another dimension might be able to control a 3 dimensional aspect within them). 

Note: if the formatting sucks, I'm using my iPhone to try and write this, so I apologize. Just came back from a bar and don't have my computer. I'm sure this doesn't make sense, so I'll revisit it tomorrow when I am nursing a hangover. I have more.

TL;DR: the inside portion of the ship cannot be expanding in the forth dimension. It's ability to traverse 4 dimensions, and exist at any number of points throughout the 4 dimensions, allows the inside to exist in an area separate from the space taken up by the outside. Both  the inside and outside exist in 3 dimensions, just occupy different areas of space and time.",0,1311671998,null,0,false,0,c280j1k,t3_izwzz,t1_c280j1k,t3_izwzz,1427394569,5,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,5

1) There is plenty of evidence to suggest it's less efficient.
2) Any efficiency gains have to be weighed against the profit middleman.
3) It's doubtful that this would be significant enough to solve the NHS funding problem.

Back to the NHS, privatisation *might* help; or it *might* completely screw it up. 

Why do we look at privatisation at all when we have the obvious staring us in the face - the NHS is underfunded; and long term we will have to fund it properly like every other nation in the world. This is true regardless of whether we privatise or not.

How about we raise spending, find out if it's inefficient (unlikely, given how much more efficient the current NHS is than its comparators), and *then*, *if* it's inefficient, *when* we have a demonstrated need, *then* we can think about these reforms?

So basing future spending on the idea that everything will go back to normal in a few years is storing up trouble for the future.

Regarding the NHS, we need to do 2 things as I said. We actually need to spend time doing research on how the NHS is best able to deliver health care for a population of near 70M in the 21st century. Is the best system a  Bismark or Beveridge, or something else for instance. This needs to be based on facts, not ideology (and that includes ""the only way is the NHS"" type thinking). 

Secondly, we need to accept the findings, and not waste time on hysteria and hyperbole. The NHS is treated as a scared cow in the country, and while it is a good system we often make it out to be perfect rather an about average for the 1st world. The best options for the NHS might not be something you like for ideological reasons but you need to accept that your ideology might not match up with reality.

Private provision of public services does work, in some cases arguably better than public provision, we can see this because of reports such as the ECHI ( [2009](http://www.healthpowerhouse.com/files/Report%20EHCI%202009%20091005%20final%20with%20cover.pdf), [2010](http://www.fcpp.org/files/1/ECHCI2010%20Final.pdf) ). We can't just raise spending because we've literally run out of money, and debt interest repayments are starting to eat up sizeable chunks of our faltering GDP.

Truly fact based research would be good, but we're never going to get that. It's just not possible to separate the politics out. In the meantime, I haven't yet seen any particularly good reasons to outsource provision to the private sector. I mean, if there was a good reason that we could argue about, that would be something. But there isn't even that. I think that's why so many on the right wing are opposed to it - cos even they can see that there's no real point to it at the moment.

My anecdotal experience working in a company that supplies the education sector is that once the private sector gets involved, standards drop and prices go up. Certainly the sector I work in (education software) would be far, far better if it were nationalised. (Why they don't have a ministry of technology beats me).

true,UnoriginalGuy,welsh,Wales,"I feel insanely jealous of the yanks on this one. I know people out there, and they can earn tons of credit at a ""community college"" for either a degree or masters remotely.    

They receive a special TV channel, and have to complete assignments and attend one of a series of locations to complete a test at the end of the year.    

What you can do is earn the equivalent of the first two years of a degree without ever stepping foot in a classroom, and the cost is much cheaper than the OU used to be before this big price hike.    

They then transfer these credits into a ""real"" college/University, and then attend classes to earn a full respectable degree (with no sign of having taken remote classes).    

I seriously looked at OU last year, but didn't because:    

 - Price was almost as high as a ""real"" University (which would include: classes, lectures, materials, etc)
 - Degrees were special non-standard versions (e.g. no ""Computer Science"" but ""Computing and I.T."") 
 - I didn't understand what I was getting for the, frankly, extremely high price    
 - It would years 
 - You couldn't transfer many credits (credit transfer limits) 

I cannot help but wonder if the OU's prices are less to do with the quality and more to do with the fact that they have almost a monopoly in this field. If anyone has attended the OU I'd love to hear what you think about all of this - maybe I'm wrong?

true,Talonwhal,null,null,"I really dislike a lot of religion - some religions more than others. I base this on what the religion teaches (ie. the contents of it's holy books). I can probably safely say that I hate Judaism, Christianity and Islam the most as they are the still-existing religions which have the most sickening texts, imo (although Christianity gets a slight repreive if you only go by Jesus' teachings and ignore much of the rest - which some people fortunately do!) Buddhism, for example, I don't have as much of a problem with.

I don't dislike religious people, though. I judge everyone on a person by person basis depending on how they act, religious or not. So I will like some muslims more than some atheists, some jews more than some muslims, some atheists more than some jews, etc.

But don't kid yourself into thinking that *religion* itself isn't a problem. People are capable of hellish autrocities by following what the Bible or the Qur'an says.

It's great that people interpret it in a less fanatical way and good on you, personally, for doing so - but I've read massive amounts of all religious texts and there it *no doubt* that there is some really fucked up depraved stuff in there. I'd start pulling up quotes but is this really necessary? If you want to start defending the Qur'an line by line then we can go down that road, but I think you know as well as I do that deep down inside you don't agree with every single thing that book says.

But I have a question for you - religions can be created and abandoned. They can evolve (Islam is the result of thousands of years of religious evolution), and for better or for worse there's no reason you can't take another step forward and denounce parts of the *Qur'an itself*. If you don't, then you are part of the problem, for this reason:

The more people who stand behind a book like this and say, ""This book is the divine truth, no bad word may be said about it, it is infallible"" - the more people will take every line of it literally and commit autrocities in it's name. And that is *your* fault and the fault of *everyone* who holds the point of view that the book is 100% perfect.

You won't denounce any of the Qur'an, yet you say not everything should be taken literally (this is almost the same thing for all intents and purposes).

But what is further an enigma is: How/Who decides which parts are to be taken literally, and which parts aren't?

And yes, it causes a problem as I mentioned. No, you *personally* are not a direct problem to me, the country, or anything, or anyone - I'm not against your actions or 99.99999% of your beliefs. However the atmosphere created due to so many people thinking in the way that you do creates a problem.

If you're not willing to denounce anything in there, but instead dance around the issue with ""this bit isn't supposed to be taken literally"", but you still hold that it's a 100% perfect book, then: While you're not *responsible* for someone who feels they are vindicated by the beliefs of over a billion people when they commit an atrocity, you are still a factor when these things happen and it is something that you can do something about. If the majority of muslims made it clear that they *did not agree with* certain parts of the Qur'an, then it would lessen the power it has over the people who take it literally, because they then *know* they are in a minority - even if they *are* in a minority now, it's not clear to the people themselves! This is the crux of the issue, isn't it?

This is where there is a glaring distinction between say Christianity and Islam in the UK:

When someone commits an autrocity in the name of Christianity, they know damned well that they will be backed up by *almost no one at all* in the Christian community here. PEopel are *well aware* that most Christians don't all believe 100% of the bible (excepting crazy ones in various places - note that these people are all insane, hmm!).

When an autrocity is committed in the name of Islam, these people believe they are acting in a way that many other muslims would approve of *even though they are wrong in this assumption*. Because they think that ""the Qur'an says this; they *know* that 'all muslims approve of the Qur'an 100%'; end of"".

And only the moderate muslims can fix this problem with Islam - going on a march of 30,000 people to denounce extremism, then continuing with the status quo atmosphere of ""the Qur'an is infallible, the most 100% perfect book ever written, etc."" then you're not doing a damned bit of good.

Now, it took a great span of history for western Christianity to get to this point, and the world is a better place for it. No longer can you gain power in an argument by name-dropping God or quoting from the Bible. We had crusades nad dark, dark periods in our history when people were *scared* of disagreeing with what was perceived of the will of God and it was a *terrible* time.

We believe in the second coming of the Messiah, who interpreted Islam in the way it should be followed.   So to answer you question it would be someone with the wisdom to understand the verses correctly and interpret them so.  

**However the atmosphere created due to so many people thinking in the way that you do creates a problem.**

So just because a lot of idiots are about who call themselves Muslim I should change my way of thinking?  Why can't they change their views? Why put it on me?

**While you're not responsible for someone who feels they are vindicated by the beliefs of over a billion people when they commit an atrocity, you are still a factor when these things happen and it is something that you can do something about.** 

Actually no, I'm not a factor at all when some stupid nutcase blows himself up, if you look at our history you will realize that we are a minority in Islam and the majority happens to hate us.  If the majority did think like we did, there would be no Islamic terrorism in this world.

**If the majority of muslims made it clear that they did not agree with certain parts of the Qur'an, then it would lessen the power it has over the people who take it literally, because they then know they are in a minority - even if they are in a minority now, it's not clear to the people themselves! This is the crux of the issue, isn't it?**

You seem to be implying it's the religion that is the problem and not the people, but it is the other way round. Islam is perfect, but the majority of it's followers are not understanding it correctly.  How can you adapt the religion which has been around for over 1500 years? It's the people that need to change.

**PEopel are well aware that most Christians don't all believe 100% of the bible (excepting crazy ones in various places - note that these people are all insane, hmm!).**
I get the impression in your eyes anyone who is religious is crazy. Personally I think Christianity is a failing man-made religion, nothing against it, but it no comparison to Islam.

**When an atrocity is committed in the name of Islam, these people believe they are acting in a way that many other muslims would approve of even though they are wrong in this assumption. Because they think that ""the Qur'an says this; they know that 'all muslims approve of the Qur'an 100%'; end of"".**
Wrong, when a atrocity is committed it is because that nutcase was stupid enough to believe what was fed to him rather than investigating himself.  For example.. suicide bombers.  Commiting suicide is one of the worst things you can do as a Muslim, so how do these idiots carry them out and still believe they are heading straight to heaven? They didn't do it because the *majority* would approve, they did it to get to heaven, but obviously to thick realize they are heading for hell.  A suicide bomber is not a Muslim, he is a terrorist.

**...then you're not doing a damned bit of good.**
In your opinion maybe, and we are not here to please you.

**Now, it took a great span of history for western Christianity to get to this point, and the world is a better place for it.**
Again, thats your opinion, but is it really a better place? All I see is very greedy people... standing on the shoulders of the poor.

**If you wonder why many people still consider Islam to be in the dark ages, then this is why.**

I feel that just saying that our form was in large part due to a boost in morale is a bit of a discredit to the shift in tactics and team culture that Dalglish brought. Making players believe. And maximizing the talents of players and encouraging them to play out of position and making them more versatile.

And I also disagree with any public sentiment that LFC are being cheap. They certainly splashed the cash in January and over the summer.

Ultimately, I suppose my thinking is that - on paper - we are a better team this season than last season and with a healthy Gerrard. And if we were able to battle our way to 6th last season, why couldn't we do better this season?

After all, we can still judge ancient religions based on their precepts without them even having any followers or really much of an idea how they practised it (as you say, it can differ massively from what is written down!)

Now, you said:

&gt; Religions don't just teach the contents of their holy books.

This is true, but it is cultural influences which change this over time - this is usually a corruption of the core religion and the laws that were laid down in the holy texts. But that doesn't change the fact that every type of Christianity is based on the Bible, every type of Islam is based on the Qur'an, etc.

To ignore that is silly - and then you'd be all surprised - OH MY! Why did someone just kill all those people when they're from a nice religion who would never do anything like that! :O Well it's not really THAT surprising when you consider what it says in their holy book.

true,koltra,null,null,"Firstly I agree that the holy book is important, and perhaps the single most important thing to look at when trying to understand a religion. 

But when we judge ancient religions based on their literature it's just because that's basically all we have. I'm sure everyone who studies any kind of ancient religion would give their left leg to be able to go back in time and observe how people actually practiced it and what they believed rather than just what they wrote down! I reckon if you had a time machine could strike a deal with many a scholar: I'll go back in time and destroy, say, all copies of the Gospel of St John, but in return I'll take you along to 100AD and you can hang out with some early Christians and see what they actually believed and did. Besides, we also infer from archaeological and other evidence things about ancient religions that we don't have any written evidence. And even confining ourselves to written evidence, you don't just look at an ancient text and say: ""okay, people must have believed everything that's written here!"" You ask: is this bit a story, or a parable, or a moral fable, or a history? Is this bit meant ironically or literally? Who used this text (the priests or the followers? the men or the women?), who did they think wrote it, what other texts did they combine it with, and so on? What other things did they also believe that show how they interpreted it? What bits might we be missing and what might they say?

Even if it were true that religions were generally corruptions of some core religion and laws inferable from some book (and I don't quite agree with this), so what? The fact is religions, as they are today, are corrupt, and weird, and interpret their text in certain ways, and you need to know what the corruptions are to understand what it is that the people who practice that religion today believe.

And they *don't* need to tear out any pages from their holy books. Most Christian's are quite free of most of the more horrible things said in Leviticus, not because they've removed them, but because they think they no longer apply. Does *any* Christian make burnt offerings of animals? But the bits of the Bible explaining that you should do this are still there, it's just they've tacked on all that guff about Jesus making a new covenant with them at the end, and they interpret the old bits in light of the new bits.

Is Christianity really based on the Bible? Isn't Bible just as much based on Christianity? People who believed certain things chose certain books to be in their Bible, and wrote certain new ones to add to them. And even when the text has been fixed, it's so contradictory and vague and long that I feel sure many interpretations of religion are more based on people who already believe something and want to act in a certain way straining every fibre of their being to reinterpret their holy book to try and make it say what they already know they want it to say.

You certainly should differentiate between religion and the people who practice it, but I think there are at least three levels:

1. what the holy books actually say 
2. how this is interpreted by any given religion into a set of beliefs and prescribed practices
3. what people who profess to believe the religion *actually* believe and do

It's very easy for us atheists (hope I'm not wrongly assuming here) to pretend that the first is what the religion really is. Religious books usually have such silly and horrible things somewhere in them that it makes it very easy for us to say: this religion is dumb, or immoral because, look, its holy book says this. It makes it easier to win arguments, but I don't think it necessarily makes it easier to persuade religious people to change either their beliefs or the more intolerant of their practices, and anyway, I think it happens to be incorrect.

It would essentially be a 2 v 3/4/5 (lets face it, probably 5 for most of the teams in the premier league) in the middle of the park. Even if Drogba and Malouda drop in to help with the #s, neither of them are very good at speeding up the play and sending it to the forwards, with the ball usually stalling at either of their feet (for Drogba this is because he is used and suited to holding the ball up for people behind him to arrive, not sending the ball forward and chasing it, what Lampard is best at).

Also, Lampard would probably not make the first 11 in this formation either, since even if he's one of the 11 best players, that role totally limits his best traits- positioning and arriving late in the box, helping move the ball from the back 5 (with the DM) to the front 3.  

Also I don't know if Luiz has ever played RB, though he has played LB.  I would rather see him in the middle of defense with Iva out on the right, just because I believe Iva is fairly competent with his crosses and can help slide back in the middle if Luiz pushes up in to a DM role when we are countering/attacking (which I think would happen a lot if we played your formation).

No problem, was a good read.

I'm just going to have to reiterate the reasons for my original, original statement though, regarding this:

&gt; And they don't need to tear out any pages from their holy books. Most Christian's are quite free of most of the more horrible things said in Leviticus, not because they've removed them, but because they think they no longer apply. Does any Christian make burnt offerings of animals? But the bits of the Bible explaining that you should do this are still there, it's just they've tacked on all that guff about Jesus making a new covenant with them at the end, and they interpret the old bits in light of the new bits.

I *do* see this as a problem, because people aren't willing to edit or adopt new versions of holy texts.

The words themselves don't have power, but the number of believers gives them power - yet the nubmer of believers also gives power to the crazy bits *by association*. Don't take my word for it, there is direct evidence of this and you can probably confirm it with a little thought experiment.......

Some bible literalists in the USA today don't actually stem from a literalist branch of Christianity, so they've actually gone about turn and decided that everything in the Bible is literally true (even if contradictory! Yes, they're crazy and you can't argue with them, but they believe it regardless!)

Now imagine for a moment that in the 1800s a couple of books from the bible were removed from a mainstream religion (Catholic, Protestant, whatever) creating a new version of the Bible (there already exists a bunch of versions with various books included/excluded). Now, these books could have been removed for any reason (say, because some ""evidence"" suggested they aren't from a divine source (due to being fucking weird or whatever :P) and should never have been included). Now, 200 years later when these literalists start taking things literally again, they're taking a different set of christianity literally. There is a *possibility* they might go and pick up those old books too, but it's unlikely - there's hundreds of other books that could have been included in the Bible and weren't. There's others that have been taken out or added in throughout history and they never added those in.

No, make no mistake about this: The **only** reason they believe their current edition of the bible is the one, true, exact and literal divine book is simply inferred consensus from the other 2 billion christians *who don't even believe it should be all taken literally*. Ridiculous, but true. And what's more, we'd already be looking at the recently removed texts as history - things people don't believe any more, like the ancient holy texts of greece and egypt. They're silly, ancient, irrelevant, from a simpler time when people were all big dummies!

(It's interesting because if Christianity had died 1000 years ago then today when we read it, it wouldn't even seen as relevant as it does today, it would be like reading any other retired religious texts - it is *only* the billions of people that believe it that give it any power at all, and unfortunately they give power to the entire book, regardless. And the bible would *seem* more archaic, childish, and etc. - of course you may think so if you've read it anyway, but many people attribute a subconscious respect for texts that billions of people believe, even if they don't themselves)

And anyway, this is where I bring in radical Islam! Ta-da! :P

If by consensus people were willing to ""rip out"" the parts of the book that can lead to radical acts, then it becomes irrelevant archaic text. It can't be used as justification any more. People no longer read these things and think it justifies their autrocities, because no one else believes them. They would no longer be fighting a war of Allah any more than they'd be fighting a war of Thor. This is why by consensus non-radical muslims are helping re-affirm radical Islam, just as the sheer number of christians across the globe and through time are enablers of fundamentalist Christianity in the USA. Human psychology is just like that - you can argue around this and say it's fine it people don't believe it or practise it, but that doesn't stop people from abusing it. You can take that weapon from the hands of these people by editing a book.

And it's interesting, too, that once a text is ""dead"" and removed from any existing religion it is very rarely *if ever* resurrected. It becomes a joke, a myth, no one will take it seriously, no one will take seriosuly anything you do in it's name. The power is gone because there aren't a billion+ people who revere that text (even as a loose grouping of texts).

A final question:

Don't you think it would make a *really big difference* if there was *nothing at all* in the Qur'an that could be interpreted as justifying the killing of non-believers?",0,1311708542,null,0,false,0,c283ve3,t3_j01dp,t1_c283ve3,t1_c283j2n,1427396143,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

true,Axius,uk,United Kingdom,"I would interpret these figures somewhat critically. Especially due to the nature of the tests already being loaded - the tests were to see if someone was capable of work rather than an analysis of their condition before making an assessment. The 'Yes' and 'No' tickboxes further aggravate this problem. 

7% of people were deemed incapable of work. That's fine.

39% were deemed fit for work. This one particularly stands out - 39% of those reviewed could have been wanting to go back to work but shouldn't, but this test would not accommodate for that. I would not consider this to represent 39% of the people were just scrounging from the state - certainly some quite possibly were, but 39% of that 1.3 million people, roughly 507,000 people, trying to cheat the system just seems like an abysmally high figure. I imagine there are errors in that.

17% were considered capable of working given the correct support - I would have imagined these same people were put on Jobseekers or some such other programme to get them back into work. 

36% dropped out. I don't think they all could be considered to be people trying to cheat the system. I've heard of people who were meant to have an assessment for disability benefits and haven't turned up because they're either ashamed they can't work any more or they feel they are being assessed because they feel they're accused of lying/are potentially okay to resume work and decided to leave it. I remember reading a statistic about a number of people who simply don't like the hassle of getting the paperwork and tests done to claim benefits - something I don't doubt happens.

To be honest, the whole thing lately reeks of a money saving exercise. The only proper time to do something like this would be when businesses and the economy was in a fit state to accommodate for workers who may need more support than others. Yes, we're meant to live in a world that doesn't discriminate, but I think most of us know that the world simply isn't that fair.

It should be a priority for the government now and those coming in future to ensure that the welfare state is not crushed by the well-off and healthy under some premise that society is equipped to handle what the government will not. Charities and voluntary organisations can only do so much, and a lot of people rely on benefits just to have a standard of living that some of us would consider poor, but it's better than the alternative. Means testing and the plethora of experiences we're putting people through is only as right as it sounds on paper, sometimes I feel we're dehumanising the benefits process.

Over the past year I walked 2.5 miles to uni (Aston Uni, in Birmingham) 5 days a week. I walked through the ""black"" area, through the ""Asian"" area and to the ""mixed"" area (i.e., town centre). On my journey I saw different clothes, heard different language, smelled different foods, etc.

Quickly I realized that as humans immigrate they tend to seek out those they share common background and interests; African guys seek other African guy, Asians seek Asians, etc - until a tipping point is reached where there is a concentration of a certain ethnicity in a particular area. This also leads to the indigenous (white) population moving house if they can afford to - the ""there goes the neighborhood"" mentality. 

From this point we have enclaves of ethnically different people that have transplanted their culture into that particular area of the UK. This is detrimental for integration as they are not mingling with the indigenous population. This leads misunderstandings and eventually to frictions among the emerged sub-groups.

To avoid this and encourage integration an agent must control the situation - i.e., the government must assigning immigrants to live next door to the indigenous population and ensure the indigenous do not move out.

Both grandparents where disappointed that I didn't appreciate going to a very over the top building to worship an imaginary man in the sky. They thought I was young and would grow out of it. I haven't.

I once had a lady come to the door, might have been Jehovah's, and asked if my parents where home. I was 14 at the time, I remember it well, and then she asked me if I were religious. I replyed 'No, I'm athiest"" she then replyed in a very patronising tone ""oh that is so sad to see someone so young a non believer"". I tried to discuss why a number of facts and my own beliefs didn't seem to correspond with a religion... The lady couldn't discuss with me the who's and whys and left without conversation.

I'm not saying I'm not religious. Or that I do not believe in something. I do, that is to be a living human. However I'm not going to be part of some clique.

The problem is that the more we try to weed out the cheats, the more we end up harming the people we're trying to help.

The answer isn't simple... I think it has to come from GPs. But rather than make it easy for GPs to make the problem go away by saying someone is unfit to work... we need to find a way to get it working properly. They can't have a set target because some areas of the UK have much more unwellness than others. They can't have an incentive to say people are fit to work... not unless there's an appeals procedure which hammers GPs for getting it wrong.

I really like the 4-2-3-1 a lot, but I think it would be a mistake to take Lampard out of the hole since that is where he has always been most productive. I put Drogba at LW because 1) he is creative enough to link up with Cole when he makes his runs forward, 2) he has a good left foot and can cross well, and 3) he would be deadly coming across goal on his right foot. I think Drogs could be deadly from this position.

I also think Ramires can overlap with Sturridge on the right and help out in the attack, which would let our RB (here Luiz, but also Ivanovic) focus primarily on defense, only getting forward from time to time. Our defense would be plenty shored up with Mikel helping out and our RB tending to stay back, and I think Ramires has some good attacking/crossing capabilities.

&gt; Don't you think it would make a really big difference if there was nothing at all in the Qur'an that could be interpreted as justifying the killing of non-believers?

I guess I just think that people who wanted to be violent would find some other religion to justify their violence. It would make a big difference right now, in that suddenly a lot of violent people would have no religion to base their violence on, but they (or people like them in the next generation) would find a new one soon enough.

Your points about reasonable religious people giving legitimacy to crazy ones by not removing the crazy bits from their books are good.

The funny thing about biblical literalists (at least much of the current American kind) is that I'd imagine even the ancient Hebrews who wrote the thing in the first place would find them a bit funny. ""Wait a minute: we wrote a story about a talking snake who tempts someone to eat the fruit of a tree called ""The Tree of Knowledge of Good And Evil"" and you reckon the thing is meant to be literally straightforwardly true and the important stuff you take away from the whole episode is stuff like God created all species in their current and static form from the beginning of creation? What? We're insulted that you'd think even people from 3000 years ago unsophisticated enough to have not heard of (and use) parables and the like.""

Newborough forest on the Malltraeth side is good, it's out of the way and there is little chance of anyone coming along. Just find a little clearing in the woods away from the main paths, or a dip in the dunes.

Having said that, it is illegal I just don't think it's enough of an issue, unless someone specifically complains about you, that the police have better things to do.

A few things I'd like to get some thoughts on....

Early last season when malouda was actually on form some people were suggesting we should play cole - zhirkov - malouda down the left hand side. They could overlap and create runs for each other and we would finally have some attacking bite and some decent crosses coming in from the left. AVB tried it in one of the friendlies I think, but I'm not sure how it worked out. Any thoughts on this?

Kakuta: Where do you guys see him fitting in next season? 6 month loan? Backup or rotation player? Maybe a player better suited for some of these alternate formations like the 4-2-3-1?

I can see AVB giving chelsea a little more (much needed) flexibility.

Gillan did not seem like she does in all the BBC promotional stuff here. In the BBC's material she is looking at the camera, speaking confidently, looking up. In the interview she was moving somewhat erratically and looking down. That's a change, and it's going to draw speculation.

So rather than just speculate in silence I figured I'd ask more knowledgeable fans, who presented me with explanations that present Gillan in an extremely flattering light. 

I have asked and I have been informed that she behaved the same way last time she was on Ferguson's show. Any suspicions I had have been confounded and I am now less certain that anything ""rumor worthy"" could be going on.

I'm sure there are quite a few people who saw the interview, noticed what I did, and will see this discussion and go ""OH, that explains it,"" or ""oh, well I guess it's more complicated than just [insert drug rumor here].""

true,[deleted],null,null,"Budget/production values improve dramatically in season 2, and keep climbing until this season, in my opinion. 

The fans will argue about the plot quality into oblivion, but most fans seem to really like season 2 better in terms of writing, and quite a few of us feel that season 3 and beyond are really well-written. My personal favorite episode in terms of scripting is from Season 4... and I don't even like that incarnation of the Doctor. 

I also have a little tidbit about the writing that is a very slight spoiler, but it in no way reveals any details about the events that will come. It does, however, shed some light on the writing quality in seasons 1-2 versus 3-4. It will be in spoiler tags below.

When I first started watching season 2, I found that I personally didn't like the choices the Doctor and his companion were making, finding them ever so slightly out of character for the Doctor, and generally just distasteful for the companion. Most of the fans disagreed with me, and saw no problems with his behavior. I had, by this point, seen a little classic Doctor Who. I speculated that [the tenth Doctor was a deconstruction of the moral orientation of earlier Doctors and how it is altered by his companions](/spoiler). Season 4.5 proved my hypothesis essentially correct, at least in the traditional definition of the literary school I was using, with the addition with a bunch of reconstructions of classic series elements and ideas. So basically, I think that Season 1, 2, and to a lesser degree 3 and 4 FEIGN bad writing in a few places for a massive thematic payoff later. 

If you're having trouble with season 1, try a ""one shot"" episode or sequel to an episode you've seen in each successive season to see if it improves. Here are some suggestions: 

Season 2: New Earth
Season 3: The Shakesapeare Code (fan favorite from this season, ""Blink,"" is ""Doctor Light"" and has very little of his personality)
Season 4: ""Fires of Pompeii"" (production values), ""Planet of the Ood"" (plot), ""Silence in the Library/Forest of the Dead"" (both, but a two parter)
Season 5: The Beast Below

Don't bother with season 6 if you don't like the season five episode. The only episode that isn't heavily invested in Season 6's story arc is ... somewhat lackluster, and the season opener is a little weird given some of the spoilers in the previous season. 

TLDR: It's supposed to seem a little cheesy, and it's got a really cool reason for it, but production values get a LOT better over time. Skip around a little to see how well you can take it. ",0,1311753736,null,0,false,0,c288kg1,t3_j0vi8,t1_c288kg1,t3_j0vi8,1427398422,1,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,1

On the other hand, they bring in a lot of money. Not just to the pubs, but to the outdoorsy-type shops etc, so there is a recognition that they are important for the local economy.

However, there is no hatred for the job they do at all, and I would completely reject the politically motivated post by CarolusMagnus below.

true,AlanCrowe,null,null,"&gt; What the fuck? How exactly do you determine if someone should not be sent for assessment?

The Benefits Agency sends claimants an IB50 form, which they fill in. It is a detailed form, running to about 20 pages. It includes sections for the contact details of doctors and hospitals and claimants must give permission for their doctors to disclose their medical history to the Benefits Agency. The Benefits Agency writes to the patients doctors and obtains information about their medical condition to add to that disclosed in the IB50. 

Deciding whether to send someone for assessment is step three in the claims processing work flow.

There is a threshold in the statutory instrument at 15 hours regarding allowable therapeutic work. The way that the system is supposed to work is that only people capable of working more that 15 hours per work pass the Capacity for Work test. Someone who is believed to be capable of working 14 hours a week (because they do, as approved occupation therapy) but no more, is regarded as incapable of work. This is logical because the purpose of the social security system is to ensure that people have enough money to live on, and people who are not well enough to put in the hours to earn a living don't.

&gt; 7% were incapable of any work

The typical valid claim is from someone in their 50's with arthritis, or emphysema, or some similar chronic condition that leaves them knackered but not totally fucked. They live independently, rather than being cared for in an institution, and if they take their painkillers and their anti-inflammatories and stop and rest when they get out of breath they can manage a little light work. They are not employable and putting them on Job Seekers allowance and having employers weed out their applications is a waste of everybody's time. ""Incapable of any work"" is not the plain English way of describing this. 

The social security system draws a three way distinction. People who have stopped working due to illness may be able to return to their old job. They may be incapable of resuming their old line of work, but are well enough to support themselves by paid employment if they change to a different line of work. They may be unable to support themselves by paid-employment no matter how flexible they are in seeking work compatible with their health problems.

I'm out of date with all this, but the cut-off used to be at six months. Up to 6 months eligibility for sickness benefit was judged by assessing the claimant's ability to meet the demands of the kind of work they did prior to falling ill. The own job test. After 6 months the claimant was expected to work round their disability by seeking a new line of work, more compatible with their reduced circumstances.The all work test; claimants are consider for all lines of work, not just their old job.

The way this works out in practise is that a 55 year old scaffolder who suffers a spinal injury in a fall at work gets 6 months of ""can you heft a pole, use a spanner."" Then it changes to ""if you knew Microsoft Word you could get an office job, so you are fit for work under the all work test."" 

The phrase ""incapable of any work"" does have a jargon meaning of *any line of work* rather than *any amount of work*, but the BBC should be alert to the distinction and make sure that there reporting isn't confusing.",0,1311762888,null,0,false,0,c288yvk,t3_j09c5,t1_c288yvk,t1_c28444y,1427398613,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

Presumably the fact that companies are receiving the newsletter from the PR agency which has cuttings suggests that the PR agency is using it commercially.  That would mean the PR company should pay the publishers some money as they are effectively living off the back of copyrighted material and so should the end users (as they are making use of a commercial enterprise).

The criminal justice system should be about rehabilitation than non-constructive punishment.  If you think that someone deserves to be raped because they downloaded some images (and that's really all they did) then you should vote for polititians who will change the law to allow people to be sentenced to rape.

Not caught means not caught by the police. Not all measures of our crime rates come down to police figures.

The other measure is that as our prisons have gotten closer to the right wing ideal (and despite tabloid claims to the contrary the conditions in prison have dropped continually for about 20 years now as overcrowding increases) the recidivism rate has actually gone up. We now have more people coming out of prison as criminals than we did.

If he had actually crossed the line and abused a child then fine, he would have demonstrated that he is a danger to others, so remove him from society as should be the function of prisons while being rehabilitated before being released. 'Rehabilitated' does not mean 'raped by fellow inmates'.

As it stands all he has done is download some images, a relatively victimless crime, unless you want to get into the abstract concepts of creating a demand for child porn. Personally I think that's negligible, as the people who create that stuff would do so for their own satisfaction whether or not this guy downloaded it, and yes people who abuse children should get removed from society.

If you think that people should be jailed just because something is a jailable offence, you should realise that there's a difference between the law and actual justice. Sometimes, the law doesn't serve justice as well as it could because the people who make the laws often have an axe to grind. You can see a story on the front page about statutory rape law in Florida, and how even if you think that a girl is over the age of consent and has government issued documents that say so, you are still committing a crime if you have sex with her and can still go to jail.

How about this?
I really like the 4-2-3-1 a lot, but I think it would be a mistake to take Lampard out of the hole since that is where he has always been most productive. I put Drogba at LW because 1) he is creative enough to link up with Cole when he makes his runs forward, 2) he has a good left foot and can cross well, and 3) he would be deadly coming across goal on his right foot. I think Drogs could be deadly from this position.

It's a good idea, but Malouda is quite good defensively so it's a good idea to keep him out there. Tough to play Lampard though, he's good all over the pitch and playing in the hole restricts you to staying pretty far forward. Of course, playing as a holding mid also means he's staying pretty far back...it's not really a formation suited to his typical play style.

&gt; I also think Ramires can overlap with Sturridge on the right and help out in the attack, which would let our RB (here Luiz, but also Ivanovic) focus primarily on defense

Ramires can definitely overlap, he is a RM as well as a CM. However, having a defensive SB is good if it's Ivanvoic, but if Luiz is out there I think we want to encourage his forward runs.

Not sure. If we're expecting to counter-attack, yes we do lose that because he's not the right man for that - he needs to be leading the line on a counter attack. 

However, if we're playing the ball around the box I think playing in the hole is perfect.

Definitely an understated, developing part of his game. Plus operating with a different formation gives us a different look. We're a very stable team but that might mean we're too predictable. Might be able to exploit a new formation against some sides, especially in the EPL.

&gt; we should play cole - zhirkov - malouda down the left hand side

Zhirkov was very unimpressive when playing the LM role. Lampard should stay there, they know each other even better. You only really need two wide players I think, and Cole/Malouda should be fine. Zhirkov will overcrowd the wing, and all three are better out wide than folding into the middle.

&gt; Kakuta: Where do you guys see him fitting in next season? 6 month loan? Backup or rotation player? Maybe a player better suited for some of these alternate formations like the 4-2-3-1?

Another loan move IMO. Unimpressive when playing for Chelsea, and hardly heard anything from him when he was at Fulham. Needs more time to develop, Chelsea is not the right team for him right now, not with this much pressure on the team and coach.

&gt; I can see AVB giving chelsea a little more (much needed) flexibility. This is really a bit of speculation but does anyone think maybe next season we a couple different team playing styles and players getting picked based on how well they fit a given tactic? Or will it just be up to form?

&gt; Chelsea (4-2-3-1): Turnbull (Hilario, 65); Ferreira, Rajkovic (Chalobah, 77), Terry (Ivanovic, 65), Cole; Lampard (Mikel, 65), Zhirkov (McEachran, 62); Kalou, Benayoun, Malouda (Sturridge, 62); Drogba (Torres, 62)

Danny is looking good: 

&gt; It was another replacement, Daniel Sturridge, who provided the pick of the goals – turning away from one opponent and easily beating another before thrashing a shot back across goal and into the net for his first strike of the tour.

Torres still seems to be struggling though, which is worrisome.

true,Jafit,null,null,"&gt;Why should he be jailed if he actually abused a child?

Because he's a danger to others. Obviously you're being purposefully obtuse now.

People should be removed from society if they're dangerous and violent, but I don't think that we should just expect them to be raped and beaten up as a byproduct of that and just accept it as being part of the punishment, because that is cruel and unusual. More importantly it's beyond our direct control, so the 30 year old guy with a wife and kids in prison for 6 months for fraud or whatever gets gangraped and ends up dying of aids. Welp, he deserved it I guess, shouldn't have written that cheque, eh?

Anyway seeing as how it's hard to prevent that kind of thing happening, then the best we can do is see that that non-violent offenders don't get locked up with violent offenders, psychopaths and career criminals. Plus it's probably cheaper not to lock people up in a big expensive prison if we don't have to keep them away from civilians.

In the case of [this guy](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-birmingham-14304793), I'd say he should be removed from society due to the crime being violent and harming others. I don't claim to have all the answers, locking him up and rehabilitating him, even chemically castrating him won't undo the harm he's done. But we should do the best we can.

Anyway, even you have to acknowledge that there is a vast difference between that guy and the guy in the article who just downloaded some pictures, and the only difference between their punishments is the length of time, which is very hard to make proportional because these things can be hard to quantify.
