true,Rivercast,troughton,Troughton,"Right, time to turn on sincerity mode:  
I had heard about it on numerous occasions through my life, but it wasn't until a mention on The Big Bang Theory that I made a note to remember the name and investigate. I checked the TV scheduling, and noted that my local branch of the BBC (I live in Mexico) aired the show on saturday afternoons. That weekend, I turned on the TV set and thusly watched my first Doctor Who episode, *The Impossible Planet.*  
As a nerdy person, the premise immediately captivated me and I was motivated to seek out the rest of this series. However, this was definitely not going to happen by just sticking to watching TV, since all the Doctor Who that has aired where I live are reruns of seasons 27 and 28 (Series 1-2), so I went online. Slowly, I sought out every new series episode and got to watching. Before too long, I had had my fill of Tennant and Eccleston. However, all this time I had been aware that there was an era before them, and my curiosity grew, especially since it was much harder for me to find the older episodes than the newer ones.   
I searched high and I searched low. Eventually, I found tardismedia and other ways of getting at those coveted classic episodes, and I decided I wanted to watch the whole damn series in order in time for the 50th anniversary. I won't lie, it was hard for me to get into the classic series at first, but I persisted, and as the show went on and the writing got better (Starting from the *second serial,* The Daleks) I was much more enthusiastic about the classic series, being more dedicated to finding Troughton serials than to catching up with the end-of-2009 specials (and Tennant's departure) that would soon come out and most fans were getting riled up about.  
I never failed to make notice of how much better developed some of the classic plots were in comparison to the new ones, mainly because of the extended timeframe, and it quickly became my favourite thing about the show. I occasionally popped back in to see the new series episodes that were coming out and couldn't help but notice how, while plot was still important, sometimes it wasn't *the* most important part of the writing. And slowly, subconsciously, a sense of elitism managed to creep its way into my head.

If memory serves (haven't seen the episode in a while), she's not actually all the way dead, she's just been uploaded or saved or something in the hard drive. Alternatively, her timeline is moving backwards of the Doctor's, so when he met her, that would be the last time she sees him (because any further into her future is further into his past, and we see the point where they meet).  Now, he's hurtling towards the last time he sees her, and the first time she sees him.  

I suppose Moffat could write his way out of both of these problems with relative ease (uploading her into a new body, for example, then having her find a way to reverse her timeline, so that she can meet up with the Doctor and they live happily ever after), but I don't really think he will.

Personally, though, I use http://thebox.bz to download and watch them the day they air. It's a private British television Bittorrent tracker. Has the episodes up almost immediately after they finish airing. I know you said you were avoiding BT, but...I've got to kick in my recommendation for it. (The whole private tracker part is important-ish to me. Keeps out the [riff raff](http://www.rockymusic.org/img/rhpsphotoscolor/RHPS-CRH03-RiffRaffTimeWarpL.jpg)* and ne'er do wells. And if you're worried about security breaches, well, I'd say (and someone may argue this point with me) that you're safer on a private tracker than on some of these ""free and illegal"" streaming sites; they--or more accurately the ads on them--can be wretched virus incubation grounds.)

I do also buy them on iTunes (willing to support my favorite show), but you seem to be having issues there, too? What do you mean it won't let you hook it up to your TV? I've had both my Windows box and my Mac hooked up to TVs to play Doctor Who.

If you end up going  w/ either torrenting or iTunes, feel free to ask for advice/help/tech support. And if you decide that you would like an invite to TheBox, I've got two sitting in my account there.

In Iceland the Government had so much debt it had to go bankrupt or accept a large bail out by the IMF, not both.  By refusing to pay back the UK and the Netherlands Government, it has effectively chosen the former.  Those Government's can now freeze any assets that they had so that they can help repay the money owed to them.  The international courts are unlikely to help them get back their assets based abroad.  Sorry.

The UK on the other hand didn't need such bailing out externally.  Instead the UK banks were part-nationalised and had capital invested in them by the Government.  This is vastly different to the Government not being able to pay back creditors.  Not only that, but the bankers who caused the trouble that we are now in didn't do anything illegal - they were taking part in a system that was perfectly legal, but quite risky.  Apart from a few isolated instances where bankers were taking to court for deliberately altering the system for personal gain by lying about the amount of liability the banks had (which is fraud), there won't be anyone taken to court. 

What Iceland and the UK (and everyone else) should do is regulate the banks so that they can't get us in that position again.  Instead what we've allowed them to do is self-regulate so that they are just as likely to start getting greedy again in the future.

336 is probably derived from the figures in a [Guardian article](http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2010/dec/03/deaths-police-custody-officers-convicted) **Deaths in police custody since 1998: 333; officers convicted: none** from Friday 3 December 2010.

This article doesn't claim that the police have ""knocked off"" these people, but that the IPCC's study into deaths in England and Wales between 1998 and 2010 raise questions as to whether custody ""is the best place for a large number of the people the police deal with"". Inquest's co-director, Deborah Coles speaks of ""vulnerable detainees suffering from mental health, drug and alcohol problems, many of whom should have been diverted from police custody"".

&gt;Out of the total of 333 deaths, 87 people had been restrained, most commonly being physically held down by officers. In 16 of those cases, restraint was linked directly to the death, and four were classed as ""positional asphyxia"".

The recent case of Joanna Yeates' landlord Chris Jefferies is a perfect example. Following his arrest in connection with investigations, his name was dragged through the gutter by the press. See [this collage of some of the headlines](http://enemiesofreason.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/jefferies2.png), in which he was variously branded a 'peeping tom', 'strange', accused of scaring kids and being 'obsessed by death'. 

His privacy was violated, his reputation sullied. Many probably think, through association, that he was guilty of murdering Yeates. Worse still, he was not even charged with any crime. His solicitors apparently ""warned the media by letter, immediately following Mr Jefferies' arrest, in the strongest possible terms to desist from publishing stories which were damaging or defamatory"".

Jefferies was subsequently awarded an undisclosed but ""substantial"" sum for the damages, and both the Daily Mirror and The Sun were fined for contempt of court.

13 though?  Maybe not.  I mean, the new show is just so different from the classic series that perhaps 9 should actually be our new 1.

On the other hand, since each actor is so different, you get a sort of completely new show.  An unlimited regeneration might be possible.


My personal opinion, is no.  Not because of the limits, but because of the focus on 'end of the universe' plots and plots that focus on Earth.  

The original series explored the universe, complete with strange new worlds, and new life, and new civ...ahem...

The fact of the matter is, the new show is focusing too much on major plots when simple down to earth plots can be awesome as well...if not moreso (see Blink or girl in the Fireplace).

So you get a lot of variety on a night out, from cheesy pop, to swing/funk/rock and roll, to high quality electronic music. Avoids the problem of one or two people in a group just not feeling the venueand having a shit time all night (in other cities you tend to pay around £5 to get into a big club and you'll stay there all night). Capacity in a larger place in liverpool that isn't one of the huge places is a few hundre, so the atmosphere is generally more sociable, you feel more like you can talk to anyone there than in other cities where you are around other people dancing drinking and sweating but talking to them can feel like talking to strangers is a bit taboo.

The last night out I went on, I went to;

 a busy kinda run down tequila  bar that plays generally obscure dubstep/rock, (for those in the know, Ca Va)

a popular quite classy bar that plays a lot of motown, swing, generally fun stuff to dance to with a partner, (Heebiejeebies)

a fun kinda run down place that has music upstairs and a band downstairs playing rhythm and blues (the Jacaranda)

a slightly pretentious *tiny* barserving classy drinks made by very skilled barmen (Santa Chupitos)

a place that plays top 40 type stuff, standard kind of club really, big selection of £1 cocktail shots (Baa Bar)

aaand finally a place that isnt too great but its big and open late so everyone goes there afterwards, they play a mixture of any music from above. (Bumper)

I bump into people I know almost every bar I go to, and not cause I'm some social butterfly, just cause that's what happens. And your group grows and changes through the night.

The bit on GH Road from Cross Lane down to Beckside Road is part of the ring road, so one of the main roads in and out of the city is also the main road around it. And it's a single lane, so on the way out of town in an evening on there it is always jam packed. There is little traffic coming into town at that time so the trick seems to be to drive up the wrong side of the road if you want to turn right at that junction down towards Lidget Green. 

I used to live up there and every night I was passed by five or six cars on the wrong side of the road. They do not give way for oncoming cars heading down the road. They certainly do not give way for bikes. 

Strangely I'm much happier in Bradford on a pushbike than anything with an engine. I live over the border in Bramley now and cycle to work regularly.

She spends all of her time mooning over the Doctor and bitching about Rose (the Doctor doesn't bring Rose up as much as everyone remembers, it's mostly Martha whining about ""the other woman"").

I love the companions because they capture the excitement and wonder and awe that I know I would have if I were in that situation as well as the bravery and quick-thinking and luck I hope I would be able to have.

Martha doesn't represent that, though.  Martha doesn't give a toss about space and time, really.  Oh, it's cool and all, but she's along for the ride for the *Doctor* specifically.  Now I'll admit that the Doctor is fascinating and it's probably very easy to end up loving him, but that's not the point of traveling in the TARDIS.  Different people, different motivations sure, but this is  TV show and she had a role to fulfill.

Martha Jones is a great survivor, but all of her ""badass"" qualities she gains at the end of Season 3 are informed in the form of one guy fangirling over her for two minutes so they aren't really all that impressive (you never tell when you can show).

That conflict is solved by recognising that anonymity can be waived by the judge (or the victim) if it is in the interest of justice to do so.

Your proposal that a law be passed to prevent newspapers, websites etc from publishing the names of people not yet convicted is not only completely contrary to the well-established and respected principle of open justice, it's also wholly impractical and unenforceable (as superinjunctions proved) and could only be made to work by having our justice system operate entirely behind closed doors.

There are strict reporting restrictions in place for active proceedings that are designed to prevent mistrials and the sort of character assassination you've described. When these are broken there are heavy penalties, but it's a question of the media and not the justice system being at fault.

I sympathise very much with anyone who is wrongly charged with a crime, but I don't see that having that happen to them in secret is going to be better than it happening in public. At least if it's public they can proclaim their innocence.

You're throwing a lot of the responsiblity onto other people to justify why the law shouldn't grant anonymity to everyone. I think the onus is on you to show why your proposal to administer justice in secret is a) remotely practical and b) not open to abuse.

Thus it is odd that there seems to more pressure to make those accused of rape anonymous, than to make those accused of other crimes anonymous. A cynic might say it has something to with the fact that rich people are very rarely accused of violent robbery or assault; much more often of rape.

The only thing they can do is file charges against the man for each accusation, and present the evidence for those charges.

The other issue is that an accusation of rape can almost be as damaging to a person as being convicted of rape, people do tend to jump the gun on issues like that and make a snap decision regarding guilt without waiting for a conviction. There have been countless articles on reddit alone discussing the problems that people falsely accused of rape face. Where as being falsely accused of theft, speeding, GHB, drink driving or even murder (to an extent) tend to be less of an issue. It's the whole ""no smoke without fire"" attitude people have about rape arrests which are dropped.

true,TheCheesePirate,null,null,"He played well enough, but he really needs to work on his footwork. There were numerous times in the game where he would receive the ball at his feet 20-25 yards out and then have trouble getting it out from between his legs into a position where he could shoot or pass. It's not uncommon for bigger players, but that doesn't mean it's not a problem.

The one time he did manage to sort out his feet though, he laid off a nice little ball for Adam to have a crack at, though he put it wide. I think this shows that if Carroll can improve his footwork, he won't be a hindrance to pass and move. If he doesn't, then defenses which can close down on him faster than Exeter will cause him major problems in possession.

Basically, someone needs to get this guy some dance lessons so he can learn what to do with his feet.

Edit: Another solution is for him not to receive the ball with his back to goal. That goes against his target man role, but it is part of the reason he was able to score (along with a lucky bounce off of a defender's ankle).",0,1314228725,null,0,true,0,c2ez37t,t3_jtddi,t1_c2ez37t,t3_jtddi,1427515219,4,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,4

As for big Andy, I think he has many fine qualities.  His left foot is Riise-like and his head is worthwhile, too.  I saw some decent dribbling and footwork around the box tonight, so that is encouraging, as well.  I definitely do not see a lazy player or a player with an attitude problem, either.

The *only* thing I don't like about Andy is that when he's in the lineup, the other players try to get it on his head a little too often.

The problem have been the build-up play in my opinion, too few crosses have been hitting his head. I would like to see  Suarez and Carroll playing more together up front, where Suarez plays on the wing and make explosive runs into the box when possible and Carroll being a constant threat, that could be very devastating. 

I think the team should stop relying so much on air balls when Carroll is on and instead play it more at the ground and mix it up a little, with the wingers and midfielders making more runs into the box. I hope they find a balance, the constant shooting at Caroll's head everytime a midfielder gets the ball is not the best option in my opinion. Carroll has shown that he have some dribbling ability and deadly legs, so start feeding his legs, he can bulldoze through most defenders.

Teams know how to deal with Andy as we play now, because they can predict every ball and cover him, but if Carroll improves a little on his runs and positioning and the forwards on their passing to make it all more unpredicting and deadly I think he can develope into a very beautiful swan.

Here the left winger plays closer to the striker and trys to open up opportunities (mata) for him while the width on the left comes from the fullback (cole). On the right side you've got a dangerous tricky forward with a wicked foot who can cut in and score with his left foot (sturridge). On the right side of midfield they've got an energy player with lots of room to roam and space to join the attack if necessary (ramires), on the left a versatile midfielder playing a little deeper whos strong on the ball, has a lot of passing options to make plays, and can make late runs as well (lampard)

A lot of the writeups seem to indicate that porto would flow between a 4-3-3, a 4-1-2-3 and a 3-4-3. The more i think about it the more I think with might work for chelsea, esp with Mata.

Magazines + Character Building figurines from Comic Book Shop = $111.something

Magazines + graphic novel from BN = $32.something

BD Specials and Series 5 from Frys = $124.something 

Audiobooks from Amazon = $30.something

DVD Series 1 from Amazon = $47.something (boyfriend bought this)

**Grand Total:** $344.something

So I got 13 DWM and 2 DWM Specials, which is basically a years subscription for $106 (subtracting the cost of the figurines).  That's actually pretty damn good.  

The [UK subscription website](http://www.subscription.co.uk) lists practically the same deal for Americans (13 issues + 4 specials) for £111.70 ($183.00 rounded up), which I'm ashamed to admit, I subscribed to yesterday.  That brings the **grand total** to $527.00? 

The price for just the subscription and NO specials is £83.02 ($136.00), again for Americans.   

Amazon is [selling a subscription](http://www.amazon.com/Doctor-Who-UK/dp/B00006KC0G/ref=amb_link_201509822_3?pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&amp;pf_rd_s=auto-sparkle&amp;pf_rd_r=00FM09ETK2AYZD1QY293&amp;pf_rd_t=301&amp;pf_rd_p=1243382842&amp;pf_rd_i=doctor%20who%20magazine) for $150.+ @ over $11 an issue.  Which is admittedly sounds better BUT in the long run I'm paying £5.68 for 17 issues which costs me $8.80 per issue with the subscription through the UK website.  That's a lot better than $11.

Vic and Bob's humor style instantly clicked with me.  To me they feel like a comedic team deliberately calculated to my sensibilities - particularly their use of a lot of surrealist humor.

The first thing I ever saw though, was Matt Lucas's 'Lesbians' song - followed by his 'Peanuts' song.  The latter made me laugh to the point of hyperventilation on repeated viewings.  So I had to find out more about this wonderful show!

After that I began looking for more shooting stars stuff and discovered the surreality and sheer insanity of the show.  I dug more into bob and vic and found out about their sketch comedy and their original stage act.  I watched documentaries on them, various interviews, have religiously watched and re-watched 'smell of reeves and mortimer' 'vic reeves big night out' and 'shooting stars' eps over the course of the past year.

I have grown to love the other British comics and celebs closely associated with them as well.  Mark Lamarr, Johnny Vegas, Ulrica, etc.  Matt Lucas is a personal favorite of mine and I'm now watching a lot more of his stuff.  I also own the Angelos Epithemiou iphone app!

So yeah - above all I'm definitely a semi-hardcore American Vic and Bob fan now.

Isn't it amazing what youtube can do?  Hell if I could buy episodes of vic and bob stuff through itunes, I'd have done that by now.

Anyway I hope to turn on a lot more people I know to vic and bob.  Hopefully I can help foster the necessary demand to bring their amazing work here.

PS - My favorite shooting stars bits?  Hmm...

There's so many to list!  Well, here's a few off the top of my head.

- ""Peanuts"" song.
- ""Arrest that jazz pancake!""
- The ""Keyboard split.""
- Any scene with the walking ironing board.
- Vic playing some music at the top of a playground slide before sliding down it.  (He gets kissed by the woman guest for it I think too.)
- Geordie Jeans/jumpers.  (For helping spring me into learning what a Geordie is.  Ha!)
- Johnny Vegas on the merry-go-round.
- Vic pulling a tiny wagon with his teeth.
- ""Bill Cosby was the world's first black man.  True or false?"" (Answer: Of course not it was Sydny Poitier.)
- Most anything with Donald Cox (including his infamous outtake blunder)
- Johnny Vegas's Christmas episode rant.

God, there's so many to list.

Universities are brands as are the courses, so signing up to a third rate Uni doing a fun degree will be a waste of cash. The days of any degree counting are ending. For example big firms in the City or the professions publish a list of Universities that they will accept applications from. If those are the types of job that you aspire to then make sure you go to the right Uni.

My tip is research the career that you want, find out what they actually ask for. I keep meeting people who sign up to courses on the assumption that it is suitable without even checking or based on what they heard from a mate or the salesman (admissions) at a Uni.

Also check that roles have progression. What seems aspirational now (money or role) might not have any progression once you are in it.

My alltime favorite sketch is probably their 'Maserchef' parody with vic floating around with his fork fingers and inflated head.

Others include:

- Their entire 'Food &amp; Drink' segment from episode 1 of smell of R&amp;M.
- The stotts interviews with Sting and Sinead Oconner.  (2 separate sketches)
- Otis &amp; Marvin trying to do a 'consumer report' and apparently everything goes wrong with the sketch that could have but they decided to air it anyway.
- Talc &amp; Turnips.
- Barry White seducing a copper pipe.
- Vic and Bob in their frying pan fight where vic gets flattened.
- Footloose &amp; Two Owls.  (And the frying pan fight after it.)
- Vic and Bob as dancing German girls with expanding chest areas.
- The 'cottage cheese' song.
- ""I remember punk rock.""
- Noel's Addicts (which made me look up what they were making fun of)
- Stars in their eyes
- Most of Mulligan and Ohare.  Particularly 'It's raining men' and anytime they're in those ridiculous made-up instruments.
- ACTION IMAGE EXCHANGE

And speaking of exchange, I think I should do you brits a favor and raise (raises arms) your consciousness right now about another surreal comedic duo that is quite popular here in the states among weirdos like me: Tim &amp; Eric.

Since you posted those vic &amp; bob fosters sketches, they reminded me of the insane absolut vodka ads Tim &amp; Eric made with their good and equally bizarre comedian buddy Zack Galifianakis.  The deal with absolut was that they commissioned various filmmakers to do whatever they wanted in their ads as long as they showed the product in them.  So Tim &amp; Eric took that to ludicrous extremes.

Part 1 http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5p0QtJMKt1s
Part 2 http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EQcvKCFFW4
Part 3 http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nx6LAT-FqxU

Tim &amp; Eric are also known for tons and tons of pranks, to the point that it is often hard to tell if they are being serious (for example they claimed last year they were going to be the 'new blues brothers' and pretended to perform as them) and they have had a couple TV shows including an ongoing sketch comedy show.  They've also done music videos, such the one Eric Wareheim made for the band MGMT.  And these strange ads: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7PD4f5uTOU

What gets me the most is how good they are at pretending to be deadpan.

Here's an example of how deadpan they can be: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kn7CT7ryvG8

And here's something else they did that I always loved: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lT12vYYqEJo

Tim &amp; Eric in particular are noted for often using what people for some reason call 'anti-comedy' where they employ terrible acting, uncomfortable or freakish creepiness, freakout moments where they act like they're having a nervous breakdown or something equally unnerving, unbelievably lame-on-purpose jokes, and deliberately cheesy looking production values.  The end result is something that's hard to define and hard to pin down but I certainly love it.  Like vic and bob they sometimes dip their toes in what seems like performance art.  It's not really a surprise that one can see at least a few parallels betwen the two comic duos.",0,1314264506,null,0,true,0,c2f2fvt,t3_jplnw,t1_c2f2fvt,t1_c2f1zkz,1427516812,1,false,BritishTV,t5_2rzot,1

My first reaction to Adam was that he is doing more harm than good and is selfish.  I have backed off that a little and think he will eventually mix well with Lucas as well as keeping his gunslinger mentality.  But as of right now I don't know if Lucas and Adam are the ideal partnership unless there is a third mid in there.  Henderson, because of his energy and touch seems like a pretty good candidate to partner Lucas but he is a bigger work in progress than Adam.  I think Henderson has a lot of talent but he seems a little sheepish sometimes.  Gerrard is the second most dynamic player with the ball at his feet and in front of goal, behind Suarez.  It seems wasteful not to keep him higher up the pitch.  He could play on the right as Kuyt does and actually be more effective, maybe.

true,bigbadbass,uk,Herts,"So I found this a bit late, but I''m going this year and been the last 2, so think I can answer your questions with more certainty than others.

Plan your ferry/hover travel, make sure there are shuttle buses from the Isle of Wight town you arrive in, all info on Bestival site. I'm going London - Portsmouth - hover craft to Ryde - shuttle bus.

Food is no problem, you can take in as much booze as you like, no glass though I don't think. The thing with booze is you can't take it from the campsite to the festival (festival area is closed off from like 2am - 10am). You can sneak it in under baggy clothes, but they will check your bag. They aren't that bothered about it, but make an effort to hide it or it will be confiscated going into the actual festival site.

Drugs - standard festival rules apply. Don't take too much. Wrap it in multiple layers of cling film, tin foil, drip some candle wax on it, throw some coffee beans in for good measure and I don't think the dogs will be able to smell it. Stick it in the middle of your tent at the bottom of your bag, the place least likely to get searched if they do decide to frisk you on the gates. I've never seen dogs at the entrance, but have heard they are about (they can only work for 20 mins at a time so it's not that big of a worry). 

If you are worried about this, ditch your friends at the entrance crowd and go in with some more innocent looking people.

For me, Bestival has always been about DJs. I saw Dizzee, Prodigy and the xx, but they were the only stand out live acts I liked. The rest is all DJs.

Stages - Main stage is as you would expect. The Big Top is where the big name DJs play and the cooler, less exposed bands.

The Bollywood tent is where the ravers go, it is normally dubstep, dnb and general electronica all day. This is where Rodigan normally plays as well and he is the highlight of any festival for me (gimme some love for wikipedia!).

Bjork will be good, and worth a look even if like me you don't really care for her music. 

I haven't seen Andy C for a long time, so looking forward to him.

Annie Mac has played awesome sets the last 2 years.

Other than that, I want to see Kelis (for the show), Loefah, and DJ Shadow, because he is a legend.

Also, don't forget to ask around for where the secret stage is.

The toilets are well maintained, but still shitty festival toilets. Take some wet wipes for the morning shit. A torch is also a must. I don't bother with food, I'd rather spend a fiver per meal and get something hot and fresh, and the selection is huge.

OK so I made the last part worse than it may have been, but *all* weapons police have can kill - that is why they are called weapons. Training means you put yourself at the least risk possible to stop the threat and a Taser, for better or worse, has a *low* fatality rate.

&gt;Amnesty International has documented over 334 deaths that occurred after the use of taser

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taser_safety_issues

That's 334 since Taser was used. Whilst any death is regrettable they are not the death devices some people think and they do prevent further injuries to people when used correctly.

On a different note I'm sure some people do use Taser when other options could be explored and this should be cracked down on, but I fully support Taser being used to reduce risk of injury to officers, the public and suspects.

The press reports state:
&gt;Officers tried to talk to Mr Hulmes, who had been threatening to stab himself, but he refused to open the door.

&gt;Police broke into the house and subdued him using a Taser before he was treated by paramedics. He died a short time later at the Royal Bolton Hospital. 

I'll go with the dryer press report for now rather than your Mills and Boon version.

The issue that is being avoided here is the manner in which people with mental health problems are currently dealth with by the police and later the justice system. 

* Paranoid schizophrenics account for 10% of the prison population and 1% of the general population.

* A survey of clinical records of prisoners treated by the MHIRTs showed that 18 per cent had a diagnosis of schizophrenia and another 18 per cent had a diagnosis of psychosis.  

Hulmes was clearly suffering from some mental health issue - as do significant numbers of people dealt with by the police (see above) - yet their training seems to focus on the use of non-lethal force rather than psychiatric training would be more appropriate. This is not a criticism of the police responding to this situation, but of a policing and criminal justice system that fails to discriminate between criminality and mental illness.

My advice:  Get representation, either CAB, or local community advice (the local council probably has a list of people who can help).  A lot of DLA applicants assume that the DWP will contact your GP/Specialists for you but this is not the case since it costs the DWP £30 a pop.  Get as much evidence supporting the claim as possible, Drs reports, reports from carers, and reports from specialists in whatever problem your friend is suffering.  If your friend is awaiting a tribunal, it's a looooong wait, 14 months for us.....   The process we went through was as follows:

* DLA renewal turned down after eight week wait.
* Complaint made to DLA/ATOS regarding Dr - four week wait, ATOS ignored about 80% of our eight page complaint and upheld Drs decision.

Some subjects are 100% easier than others. I had a couple of easy subjects and they were measurably easier due to the fact you didn't even have to revise for the exams.

There are only so many different questions they can ask without mixing the syllabus up a bit. I found my teachers knew what to teach to get the grades. 

A lot of the syllabus for each of my subjects changed at a-level so for the teachers they felt like it was pot luck. They taught everything rather than purely spoon feeding us like with the GCSE stuff (as they told us they were doing on a regular basis).

Students arent getting cleverer year on year, teaching is being optimised to get results.

It is a congratulations for everyone working hard and getting the results they wanted but it also has to be realised that eventually the system needs to be shaken up or GCSEs will be viewed as worthless amongst anyone beyond secondary schools.

We already have this employed I think, Malouda is more a wide forward than a winger and Cole pushes up a lot.

&gt; On the right side you've got a dangerous tricky forward with a wicked foot who can cut in and score with his left foot (sturridge).

Sounds kind of similar to Anelka, but Sturridge will be an upgrade I think.

&gt; On the right side of midfield they've got an energy player with lots of room to roam and space to join the attack if necessary (ramires), on the left a versatile midfielder playing a little deeper whos strong on the ball, has a lot of passing options to make plays, and can make late runs as well (lampard)

Music is such a broad term that it makes it impossible for me to take anyone who claims to love it seriously. What do you love? The awful tripe that fills the pop charts? No? How about country and western ? No? Ok, how about the Rolling Stones? Yes? Why? Ok, so really you meant no. How about the Beatles. Ah, now we're getting closer. Why do you love them? Oh, because they pretty frequently made music that lived up to the potential that people who say they love music mean when the say they love music, music that was utterly sublime, despite the fact that most of the music that actually gets made is actually pretty awful. Ok.

So even without Godwin's law I would still have lost the argument, because I failed to successfully communicate to you my point: the wideness and generality of a term in its proper sense and the varied behaviour of those to whom the term may be applied do not make illegitimate the usage of said term to express distaste either for a specific group of bad people -- strictly narrower than the term used --- or a group that contains along with the bad, many neutral or good. Rather, saying ""I hate bankers"" is, along with ""I hate Nazis"" and ""I love music"", an example of a very common and perfectly valid way of speaking, not an assertion that the speaker knows that all people who may be called ""bankers"" are bad.",0,1314288555,null,0,true,0,c2f4d53,t3_jswx1,t1_c2f4d53,t1_c2f23io,1427517720,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

true,TabascoAtWork,null,null,"If you want to get caught up quickly, start with 2010's Series 5 (starring Matt Smith).  It's a decent jumping-on point, as it marked a change in just about everything - new Doctor, new companion, new head writer, new production team, new TARDIS (sorta), etc.  It's more or less designed to introduce newbies to the show.

However, you will get more out of Series 5 if you start from 2005's Series 1 (starring Christopher Eccleston) instead.  But, of course, it'll take longer to catch up.  Plus, the first half of Series 1 is a little rough, with a few extra-childish episodes.  It gets exponentially better around episode 6.

Also, if you decide to start with Series 1 - *be sure* to watch the 2009 Specials in between Series 4 and 5.  *They are extremely important* (well, except for ""Planet of the Dead,"" you can skip that).  There are also Christmas specials between each season, but they're included in the correct spot on the DVDs (and on Netflix Instant).

**If you watch beginning with Series 1**, this is the correct order (not including short episodes, like ""Time Crash"" or ""Space""/""Time""):

1. **Series 1** (available on DVD and Netflix Instant)
2. **""The Christmas Invasion""** (first episode on S2 DVD/Netflix Instant)
3. **Series 2** (available on DVD and Netflix Instant)
4. **""The Runaway Bride""** (first episode on S3 DVD/Netflix Instant)
5. **Series 3** (available on DVD and Netflix Instant)
6. **""Voyage of the Damned""** (first episode on S4 DVD/Netflix Instant)
7. **Series 4** (available on DVD and Netflix Instant)
8. **""The Next Doctor""** (last episode on S4 Netflix Instant; first episode in ""The Complete Specials"" DVD/Blu-Ray [upscaled from SD], or as standalone DVD)
9. **""Planet of the Dead""** (*not on Netflix Instant*; second episode in ""The Complete Specials"" DVD/BR, or as standalone DVD/BR [first episode shot in high definition])
10. **""The Waters of Mars""** (available as standalone Netflix Instant movie, not with the main series; third episode in ""The Complete Specials"" DVD/BR, or as standalone DVD/BR)
11. **""The End of Time, Parts 1 &amp; 2""** (available as standalone Netflix Instant movie; third and fourth episodes in ""The Complete Specials"" DVD/BR, or as standalone DVD/BR)
12. **Series 5** (available on DVD/BR and Netflix Instant)
13. **""A Christmas Carol""** (*not on Netflix Instant*; available as standalone DVD/BR. *[probably will be included as first episode in Complete Series 6 DVD/BR set at the end of the year, but it was not included in already-released Series 6, Part 1 DVD/BR]*)
14. **Series 6** (*not on Netflix Instant*; first 7 episodes available on DVD/BR; last 6 episodes begin airing on Saturday - those episodes will be available on DVD/BR not long after they finish airing; complete series DVD/BR set with additional extra features and all 13 episodes *[plus, probably, ""A Christmas Carol""]* will be released near Christmas)

There.  That was probably a lot more info than you were looking for, but I figured it might help.

Finally, you *could* go back and start from 1963's Season 1, but that's insane.  I wouldn't touch any 1963-1989 *Who* until you've finished all the 2005-present stuff (and the less said about the 1996 TV movie, the better, despite the fact that Paul McGann made an excellent Doctor).

Hope that helps a bit.

I see no justice in the imprisonment of a homeless woman who picked up a bag of clothes which had been abandoned by a looter or that of a woman for receiving stolen goods (bought a pair of trainers from her lodger) whilst these louts go free.

I have got the impression that a lot of this is about the cabinet meeting shortly in the aftermath of the disaster - that seems to be specifically what the article is referring to when it mentions ""Cabinet papers"", and these have been mentioned frequently in recent reports on this new enquiry (because cabinet papers would never normally be released until 30 years after the event).

What the cabinet papers would appear to boil down to, then, is a bunch of politicians 100+ miles away from the disaster talking smack about the dead being a bunch of scumbag football hooligans. I mean, it's not like the cabinet could have made any difference in the hour or two following the disaster, not at that distance. I can't see that anything discussed there could possibly have saved or condemned the lives of those on the pitch.

This just seems to be more about the following day's headlines in which the victims were branded as hooligans by the Sun - it seems like the relatives are going after the Tory politicians at the time for perhaps contributing to or aiding that narrative.",0,1314295759,null,0,false,0,c2f5dsi,t3_jtfb4,t1_c2f5dsi,t1_c2f2oqm,1427518198,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

He was then arrested and questioned over an alleged threat to Griffin - these allegations were later dismissed. However they forgot to formally (and legally) sack him so he was still meant to be in receipt of salary - this was recognised and Walker signed documents to this effect in his capacity as BNP Staff Manager... but payments weren't made hence the legal action.

Yes, that's what the ""Limited"" in ""Company Name Ltd"" or ""Company Name PLC"" (Public Limited Company) means: limited liability.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limited_company

&gt; The BNP was described as an unincorporated association with no corporate identity which left senior officers responsible for contracts

Here ""unincorporated"" means that they haven't been incorporated as a limited company, or more likely in this case, as a Non-Profit Organisation (NPO: the equivalent of a Limited Company for charities, political parties, etc).  So in this case, the individuals running the BNP are personally responsible for its debts.

Not to mention the fact that it's being pulled out of the pockets of our children and grandchildren because they'll be the ones paying back this ""loan"".

The reason they don't just call it ""printing money"" is because anyone with half a brain knows that printing money usually leads to high inflation.  Unless of course, your central bank is also keeping the interest rate artificially low to try and keep inflation in check.  So although prices are rising steadily, as anyone on the high street can tell you, the official line is that we're not in a period of high inflation because the bank says so.

Can I interest anyone in this [trillion pound loaf of bread](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperinflation)?

If this turns out to be false, I'll still continue this boycott anyway, Game suck enough to justify my hate against their brand.

I'm going to assume they went to publishers, not Steam. They usually do, and it's *probably* primarily for games that are cross platform, since they'll likely get sales from a PC gamer being pissed off that a console gamer gets the game earlier, thus they'll shop at Game.

true,Blaidd_Dwrg,eng-lancashire,Preston,"Pork pies are very easy to make and done right they're loads better than the ones you get at pie shops these days.

Acquire the following:

* A shank of bacon (bacon &gt; pork, but you knew that)
* A bag of plain flour
* A packet of lard
* Whatever herbs and spices you like

Skin and bone your bacon shank. Throw the meat in a food processor along with any spices you're using. You can throw the skin in after it if you like a bit of texture in your pie (I do!).

Boil some water in a pan. Chuck the lard in. When it's melted, dump the flour in. Turn the gas off and stir it with a wooden spoon until it's a hot sticky ball of fat and carbs.

You have to do this next bit quick before it goes cold. Separate about 1/3 of the paste ball thing off and put it to one side. Now roll out the remaining 2/3 and use it to line a pie tin. Fill it with your processed bacon. Roll out the last of the paste and use it as a lid for the pie. Make a hole in the lid for steam to escape. Glaze with egg white or milk if you're feeling posh.

Put it in the oven and bake.

Note that there is no gelatin in this recipe. I've found that bacon produces enough jelly when you bake it that it's unnecessary to add more. If you're using pork you'll need to mix some gelatin with chicken stock and pour it in before you put the lid on.

Also sorry there's no quantities. It's been years since I made one of these and I don't have my recipe book any more.",0,1314317063,null,0,false,0,c2f8atk,t3_jujqi,t1_c2f8atk,t3_jujqi,1427519654,19,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,19

I don't care too much over loan deals or not - they're maybe even preferable this summer. Adebayor is exactly the sort of prestige signing I was hoping for (an exactly the kind of player we've been missing for a while), and, given his history, the fact that we have the option to use him for a year then replace him next summer when our proposition will be much stronger sounds good. We have a really strong squad, and keeping it together was always the priority for this summer. I'm just thankful Bale's second half of the season injury troubles scared away the feeding frenzy over signing him until next year.

I think the only reason you're underwhelmed is because you were expecting too much in the first place; people seem to have this over-inflated opinion of what was achievable for us this summer, and now they're disappointed that somehow that unrealistic promise isn't being delivered on.

With what we have done we now have a very good chance of being able to offer CL football next summer - I think we're more than competitive with Liverpool, Arsenal and maybe even Chelsea. There's also a very good chance we'll have broken ground on the new stadium by then and will be able to up our wage structure on the back of the projected (massive) increase in revenues that will provide.

Kane has only just turned 18, and to say that missing a penalty is inexcusable just shows a lack of understanding of football, plenty of penalties are missed/saved nowadays, it's a mental thing as well as the fact that the 'keepers are getting better.

Townsend is a decent left winger, if he stays he'll probably be good back up for the wing positions, maybe not so much at left back.

Livermore's a decent centre mid by all accounts, you say ""uninspiring"", not all centre mids have to be inspiring, keeping possession is key to the modern game and as back-up for now he's a very good prospect. He's comfortable on the ball and strong in the tackle, and he's still only 21.

Our youth team just played a tournament in Manchester where we beat both Chelsea and United to nil and drew 0-0 with Arsenal, I'd say that that's not bad at all.

I agree with regards to Hudd, he is often slow coming back from injury but a fine player when fit. I don't blame Pav for looking disinterested in games like that, it's almost an insult to play JD against United and then play Pav with our youth players even though JD was so poor for all of last season.

Bassong is crap IMO, needs to play week in week out to be good, otherwise he is a clumsy buffoon who gives away penalties and misjudges the ball too often.

My guess is your best bet would be to find work with a company that outsources their IT; but predominantly does business in the UK; say Capita's SIMS department.

Once you climb up enough of the structure to the point that you're the only one who understands the software, they'll bring you to the UK.

That takes quite a bit of time.

Alternatively, take a step downwards. Offer yourself as a senior programmer and it makes you a good bang for buck to the companies.

Finally, it may sound silly, but try to develop a perfect accent. If you sound more or less indistuinguishable from a native speaker, you will be treated like a native British person.

Yes, although it's losing value all the time because of inflation: prices are going up so the purchasing power of that money goes down.

true,DaveLambert,tardis,TARDIS,"Boy, the writers sure did Take the Mickey with Martha.  ;)

No, but one of the problems with Martha's lone series/season is that S3 is easily the worst-written series/season of the new program.

""Smith and Jones""? It's good, I guess, as a way to introduce Martha and get her with The Doctor. [But Rhino-police who talk in short rhymes (""ko jo flo do"") and old-lady-alien-vampires with a straw](/spoiler) are a bit silly.  Doctor-Who-level silly, so we can forgive. Right, we CAN forgive. Right? Guys?

I cannot tell you how many people I talk to are disapponted by ""The Shakespeare Code"". Like the following season's meeting with [Agatha Christie](/spoiler), people just wanted a better story written for The Doctor meeting with such a legendary writer. I run across very few people who consider this worth watching more than once.

""Gridlock"" is just okay, nothing special.  The two-part ""Daleks in Manhattan"" and ""Evolution of the Daleks"" is considered just out-and-out bad by most people (myself included).  ""The Lazarus Experiment"" is a bit better than ""Gridlock"", but still nothing you feel you want to watch over and over again.

""42"" has some nice moments, including some quick humorous bits tossed into a very serious situation, and is probably one of Martha's best showcases.  Just my personal opinion here, but I personally enjoy it more than I do the next three episodes, which are the three considered to be the best of the series/season. But consider that half the season was gone by this point, but that first half of the season was full of ""meh"" (or worse) episodes.

The 2-parter ""Human Nature"" and ""Family of Blood"" are well thought of by most people, but don't showcase Martha very well considering it takes place in an era in history where ""maid"" is the best job she could have had (no worse than Rose being a lunch lady, I guess...but was a maid for far longer, as I recall). Still, it was the best way they could use Martha and still adapt the story from the book (a 7th Doctor tale) that it was based upon. ""Blink"" would be considered by most to be the best story of the year (I disagree, but I bow to the masses), but barely shows The Doctor of course, and shows Martha even less. Enough said there, because the point that these aren't exactly Martha-centric is already made.

""Utopia""/""Sound of Drums""/""Last of the Time Lords"" are all great, and show off Martha pretty darn well by now.  But she's sharing the screen with [Captain Jack, and then soon with The Master](/spoiler).  Not to mention [her entire family](/spoiler).  How's a girl gonna shine? Nevertheless, she manages to, at long last. In fact, she [saves the world, and also the worlds The Master would have attacked](/spoiler). And her final scenes of ""getting out"" was done brilliantly.

So what, she had maybe 5 or 6 good episodes out of the 13 episodes of her season?  Hell, she was in 5 good episodes in Season 4, too!  And the ones people consider the best-written 3 episodes of her season didn't feature her much.  No wonder people consider her the least of the Companions for the new program.

Some might say ""well, those 3 stories were so good because Freema (Martha) wasn't in them; the others sucked because of Martha"".  I dunno, could you see Rose or Donna being inserted into the two-part Daleks story that year making it any less crappy?  Could Rose or Donna improve Shakespeare Code, Gridlock or Lazarus Experiment to make them even a drop more memorable as stories?  Nah, sorry, can't see that.  They're just not well-written stories.  And that sucks for Martha.

By comparison, Series 4 has SO many great episodes that you want to watch again and again, that even if you find Donna ""annoying"" (many people do) you won't mind so much because episodes like Fires of Pompeii, Planet of the Ood, The Doctor's Daughter, and Silence in the Library/Forest of the Dead, are just awesome, and other like Partners in Crime, Sontaran Strategem/Poison Sky and Midnight are still well worth watching multiple times, Turn Left is simply brilliant, and Stolen Earth/Journey's End is simply epic in scope and gets bigger every time I rewatch those. Hard to fault the writing for this season!

**TD;DR - Freema gets a bad rap for her turn as Martha Jones in Series 3, but it's really the fault of poor writing as the entire first half of the season is full of episodes you would never want to watch more than once, and the best three episodes (according to popular opinion) of the entire season (during the second half of Series 3, mind you) barely show Martha much at all.**

edit: quickly realized that I should have added spoiler tags, so I did! :)

edit 2: another thought that just popped into my head about Martha's popularity: when we met her, Rose was a sales lady in a department story. Donna was an office temp.  Not exactly posh jobs.  Maybe people identify with them better, than with Martha (who's on track to get her medical license when we're first introduced to her)?

Personally I'd quite like Scottish teams to do well in Europe, I would also like Scotland to qualify for international tournaments, I feel the same about Wales, NI, and to a lesser extent Ireland. If Scotland are playing against pretty much anyone other than England I would support Scotland.

HOWEVER. The Scotch seem to have this ridiculous belief that they are in some way comparable to England, and as a result get really upity about the whole thing, booing England supporting whoever they play against etc...

Fact is, England won years ago, Scottish football is terrible. Scotland you need to admit this and stop trying to make a rivalry were there isn't one, you can't be rivals if someone has already won.

Neither is exploitative . The arrangements are well understood and accepted . If you want to remove this so called exploitation the trick is to not crash the economy - as labour did - but to have a booming economy where those temporary workers can get permanent jobs should they so want .

true,Elanthius,english,London,"I was a smart kid from a poorer family - not super poor, but the schools in my area were notoriously shit and we definitely couldn't afford a private school. I went to a grammar school for GCSEs and A levels about 20 years ago.

 My experience was that for GCSEs I did great, definitely got better grades and studied a lot harder than I would have done going to the local comprehensive. For A levels I found myself getting left behind a bit. I was seriously over extended and could not keep up with my peers. This was mostly because I was a lazy little fuck but I think also the teachers around me didn't give a shit because I was one of those pikey kids from the bad side of town so they always expected me to get left behind. As a result I finished A levels with one E and an N (for ""nearly"" apparently). That was a pretty shitty waste of two years of my life. Everyone around me was just expecting to go to university and everything was geared towards that and I obviously wasn't going to achieve that so I felt like I was left out and wasting my time.

Another major downside was that the school was all boys which I think seriously limited my social development.

So, all in all, I fully approve of the existence of Grammar schools and think that its good to separate kids out into groups based on what they are likely to achieve but you really have to be careful that people fit in with whatever group they've been streamlined into.",0,1314372070,null,0,false,0,c2fd2ko,t3_jv3cu,t1_c2fd2ko,t3_jv3cu,1427521888,12,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,12

A better solution is to improve comprehensives. You don't need to build separate schools for that. You also don't need to build separate schools or require forced segregation to provide pupils the option of practical rather than academic subjects.

In my experience, people who support grammar schools tend to do so out of short-sighted self-interest rather than genuinely believing that it's the best way to improve education across the board. That's why ""grammar schools"" are brought up rather than much more modest, cheaper, proposals such as state-sponsored boarding schools for the top 0.1% because those arguing for it wouldn't benefit.

Although he was initially impressive for Man City, he spent last season in the Championship playing for Cardiff. 

Basically, he is older, and presumably not as sharp, speedy or fit as he was 4 years ago. In addition, he has not played top-level football for a whole year. 

Lastly, Bellamy's wages will be a problem if he is signed long-term. I doubt he is on as low as 50k per week, but even that will make a 2.6 million wage bill per year. Over the course of 3 years, that would make 7.8 million, a sum that according to Arsenal is enough to pay for Gary Cahill. 

However, I read somewhere that the discussed deal for Bellamy is for a 1-year deal, so that would make it slightly better, as I don't want to see us lumbered with another free transfer signed on high wages. Still, I would only sell if I was sure of selling hopefully both Joe Cole and David Ngog.

Let me point out that the Doctor's enemies took Amy and her baby as a way to create a weapon against the Doctor. 

 The Torchwood stuff isn't on the Doctor's head.  Jack made his own choices after the Doctor left.  He chose to go back to earth; join Torchwood; rebuild it; and all the rest.  He also *willingly* gave Martha his vortex manipulator so she could TP out.

Children of Earth is not on the Doctor.  Yeah it was crappy, but it didn't happen because of the Doctor.  The Doctor didn't make him immortal.  Rose did.  The Doctor didn't take on the 497 (?), Jack did.  These were his choices.  He wasn't helpless the way Amy was.

Susan may have been left on Earth but she wasn't killed.  She got married, adopted a couple of kids, and by and large had a pretty decent life.

I'm not familiar with Frobisher.

Adric got himself killed.

K9 is a robot.

None of these people (except arguably Jack) have been forcibly separated from their child by a hostile force.  And again, the Children of Earth events are not on the Doctor's head.

If you want to organize a society in which cleverness or athleticism brings you rewards, but lack of those tends to make it difficult to succeed -- a vigourous kind of meritocracy in other words (which incidentally, we don't have now), then yes, you *must* handicap the clever and athletic so that they don't have an advantage over the stupid and unathletic. Because being clever or athletic are not the same as being virtuous or deserving. Even given the many different ways in which people define virtue, hardly anyone sensible equates virtue with cleverness and athleticism! Hardly anyone wants a society in which someone clever and athletic but cruel and evil and harmful gets lots of nice things, and someone stupid and unathletic but kind and good and helpful is caused to suffer.

Yet some people (often on the Right, and often Americans, it seems to me) say, ""Let's have more of a meritocracy than we have now. A meritocracy seems fair."" When they sort of half notice that a meritocracy won't result in the equality the Left asks for, they say ""Ooh, what do you want to do, handicap the strong to make them artificially weak so everyone is equal?""

Meanwhile, people (typically on the Left) are saying something like:

* We want people to be rewarded according to what they deserve.
* We think it unlikely that we'll be able to sort out a world in which people compete, and then only win when they happen to deserve.
* We thus wish to artificially distribute things so that people get what they deserve, not what they win through cleverness or athleticism.

Naturally this would include some other premise, like 

* People deserve according to their virtue.

But very often one of these is instead substituted for that:

* People all deserve the same, or
* People deserve approximately the same, so we may as well give them the same, or
* It's so difficult and harmful to work out what everyone deserves, that it's better to just give everyone the same.

And then silly people satirize the equality bit in the ignorant way Rush do in *The Trees*, and Vonnegut sounds like he's doing in *Harrison Bergeron*.

Why the headless monks were hiding behind the sarcofoguses in the Big Bang2.

Who the astronaut really is.

Why River can read high Galifrain without any help.

What it really says on the cot, personally I am doubtful it is the Doctors name.

What the significance with Rory's repeated dieing is.

&gt;you must handicap the clever and athletic so that they don't have an advantage over the stupid and unathletic.  Because being clever or athletic are not the same as being virtuous or deserving. Even given the many different ways in which people define virtue, hardly anyone sensible equates virtue with cleverness and athleticism!

You should've come in on my Rawlsian thread, you're clearly sympathetic.

The best way to handicap is clearly not to take from the rich to give to the poor because a) it will be resented and resisted, and b), as a consequence, regulatory capture means that the State will always end up redistributing from the poor to the rich given enough time and money.

None of that really explains why boys do worse than girls but I have an idea why that is the case; boys are not expected to do as well. It's almost always boys who end up in trouble. In my experience girls tended to get away with doing far more stuff and it was much easier to get detention or moved away from peers as a boy.

I used to do some work for a bloke who worked in construction. he was the roughest looking guy you could imagine - in his 60s, probably, with tatty, maybe jailhouse-style tattoos all over his arms and a really rough manner and speech, too.

The bloke is a multi-millionaire, with a large firm of building contractors that do a lot of work for the local council.

He obviously has some abilities to manage people, negotiate contracts and generally run his business a profit.

On the other hand, I think she has suffered less than Martha or Rose and has lost less than Donna because Amy, by the time she's 8 years old, accepts that everyone in her life goes away. 

Amy's used to her life making no sense because the shape of her life was altered beginning at a very young age by the cracks. She tells the Doctor she doesn't want to miss those years with Melody, but it's not like she'd spent her entire pregnancy bonding and dreaming of the future. The baby happened like the Doctor happened -- crashed into her life with no warning.

Her unceremonious return to Kovarian as a labor coach was probably traumatic, true, but Martha and Rose didn't get the Doctor's simple, solemn vow that he is on the way in the moments before the worst challenges they had to deal with.  

Not denying Amy has run quite a scary gauntlet, but she was far better prepared for it... one might even say *made* for it... than any other companion.

true,[deleted],null,null,"Presumptuous, incorrect, but interesting none the less. I went to a Grammar school in the time of scolarships. It was hardly a hot house, and ultimately a teaching of how to pass exams, guided by the national curriculum. The discomfort is derived from casting those 'good enough' (which usually means privileged enough) to get to do well academically as the successful and the rest as substandard and therefore destined for the second tier, perhaps apprenticeships.

It really is unhelpful and pushes the incorrect assumption that one must have a degree to be informed on a subject. I can see no better way of gaining an understand of geometry or even physics in something as lowly as carpentry. Academia is designed to create one dimensional intellectuals with no personal source of value creation outside their utility to the corporate world. Just like the army, it is all just enough education to perform.

To echo a similar sentiment to you, I am a believer that capabilities are set maybe even as early as 2-4 years old. It could already be a race lost sooner, with new research like stressed mothers during pregnancy having a higher likelihood of giving birth to children more susceptible to addictions. Certainly with something like language acquisition and numeracy, if it's not there by 11 there is little margin for improvement. I'm certainly not an advocate of leaving 'tough' subjects to university.

Looking at history, the 'best' were those who were well versed in intelectual and practical pursuits, if you think of the archetypal Archimedes or Da Vinci. I think you are making a few assumptions about 'hot-housing' and, what it seems, its only alternative of some leisurely gently paced personal study. This feels like a false dichotomy. The debate shouldn't really focus on grammar schools or no grammar schools, but the conveyor-belt, mass-productive, batch processed system that is all of modern schooling, including grammar schools. 'If I had my way...' I'd get rid of the odd construct that is the teenager, as well as the idea that the productive members of society be limited to the over 16s. Part of the problem is that schooling has no immediate feedback, its all about something abstract later in life.

It also has the benefit of focusing the anger of young men at those in the different coloured shirts. (On a tangent, but are summer riots in summer because there isn't the football on to work off all the machismo?).

The one thing grammar schools do have going is they provide a broader type of learning; access to Duke of Edinburgh awards, the softer skills of oratory and organisation, etc. But in essence the same one dimensional character is produced: specialisation might be the main ill.

Levy tried the same transfer strategy in January and it cost us qualification for the CL - the scrabbling around at the end of the transfer window was embarassing. What that told us though, is that Spurs have enough money to buy a top class striker (or maybe even 2?) AND were in the market for one. Adebayor may only be a temporary solution, it will be interesting to see how it pans out, but I don't think it was an unrealistic expectation that we would sign a top striker this summer. Everyone and his dog could see that we needed to strengthen that area of the team. It is doubly, triply, infinitely disappointing therefore to see us linked with an endless stream of midfielders... Diarra, Cole, Falque(!?), Parker.. I'm just glad we didn't spend 20 million on Downing which was a possibility for a while.

Compare Levy's strategy to what Man Utd, or even Liverpool have done this summer - by moving decisively, early and paying the inflated market value they have significantly strengthened their sides. If Levy had bitten the bullet we could have had Suarez in January. We missed a trick there. Instead we ended up making offers for half of Europe at 11:55pm.

(Disclaimer: I think Liverpool are being over rated so far this season and that they have badly over spent for what they've ended up with) 

So, While I take your points and see where you're coming from, I don't think it's as knee jerk a reaction as you think. It's been a long time since Spurs have had back to back seasons in Europe, and an even longer time since Spurs have had a team anywhere as good as this. We have the opportunity to step up to another level and I am excited about it. The club has been making the right noises, but nothing has been happening. Now it feels as though the club is starting to make the WRONG noises (Harry spouting off in the press?) and that we might end up back in an undignified scramble to get someone, ANYONE, in before the end of the transfer window. We don't need 4 more midfielders.

Finally, Gus Poyet? I always though David Moyes would be a safe bet.

true,AlanCrowe,null,null,"&gt; I can see no better way of gaining an understand of geometry or even physics in something as lowly as carpentry.

I remember helping a friend make a meditation stool with fold out legs. We played with packing to find a comfortable height for sitting. Next came cutting the pieces of wood to make the legs. They would be attached to the base of the seat with hinges and fold out. They had to [splay out](http://www.valentinesports.co.uk/images/PRODUCT/medium/1885.jpg) for stability. How long should they be? We knew the height and knew from seeing other stools that an inch of splay would be satisfactory, so naturally I used [Pythagoras](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagorean_theorem) to calculate the length of the leg.

My friend was astonished. Mathematics was something that you learned in order to pass examinations in order to gain credentials to keep up with creeping credentialism in the labour market. Learning the proof of Pythagoras' theorem was an arbitrary obstacle in an academic career. It had not occurred to her that one might use the theorem. Saw in hand, poised over the pencil mark on the expensive piece of ash, one is also aware that what is sawn cannot be unsawn. There ought to be a cheaper way finding out whether a theorem is really true, perhaps by trying it out first with pine instead of ash, or, cheaper still, thinking about it.

I was astonished too. My grammar school taught wood work. My father had a workshop. I had a workshop. Isaac Newton [had a workshop](http://galileo.phys.virginia.edu/classes/109N/lectures/newton.html). I had imbibed the [hands on imperative](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hacker_ethic#Hands-On_Imperative). I hadn't realised that others were learning difficult knowledge in a way that was divorced from applications and would forget it after their exams because they were not expecting it to be useful for anything.

If I had my way every school would have a theodolite and pupils learning trigonometry would do a little pretend surveying, getting out of the class room, working out distances between trees by measuring angles, and then checking with a long tape.

Also I can't understand why you say that ""immigration is expected to increase if the population increases""; it's not clear to me that there should be a direct connection there.

Like I said, I like Cameron Jerome, but I see him still as a championship striker, I don't think he is brilliant in the Prem, but he's fast and strong so maybe Pennant and Etherington can whip a few balls in for him to get his head onto, and he sure chases so if Walters has to come off then we still have that pressure up top. 

It looks like now we have made a formal bid for SWP, who would be perfect cover for us, I've always liked him anyway so I would have no problem with him joining, but if QPR offer him more money then it will be Europe that he has to come for.  Still would like Kyung as well, just for that continental touch, someone who the rest of the Prem don't really know of.  

I was told that Rudgey went to the Palace game to watch Zaha, and maybe Clyne :D then I saw in the paper just now that we might be offering Palace 2m for Zaha, which would be a good investment IMO, England U19 too so shows a little more experience if you know what I mean.

true,Haddaway,null,null,"&gt;As I said, net annual immigration is now stable; but since it is still positive, that means that the total number of immigrants is still growing. And since the net immigration rate has only stabilised for the last few years, the total number of recent immigrants to the UK is also increasing. So the number of immigrants per year may not have increased recently, but the number of people recently immigrated into the country has increased.

We both agree that net annual immigration is not increasing. What I don't understand is that how from this you can claim that the **positive albeit consistent** number of net immigrants entering Britain equals a **growth** in the number of immigrants entering Britain? Yes, the number of total immigrants **living in** Britain is higher than it has been in the past, but as my [second link](http://www.statistics.gov.uk/cci/nugget.asp?id=950) shows, there is no actual increase in the number of immigrants **entering** Britain.

&gt;Also I can't understand why you say that ""immigration is expected to increase if the population increases""; it's not clear to me that there should be a direct connection there. Nor can I see why the relative rates of natural growth versus immigration is relevant to this (even ignoring that AFAIK recent immigrants have a higher natural growth rate than others in the UK, which might be seen as compounding the issue).

Natural growth due to childbirth will always lead to an increase in figures of all kinds, and immigration is no exception to this. In the news right now we are hearing about [a higher number of people attending university](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-14614091), [a higher number of people Not in Education, Employment of Training \(NEETs\)](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-14644613), [a higher number of overweight people](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-14682329), and [a higher number of people with eating disorders](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-14134626).

The media report these stories simply because they are absolute increases, not relative increases. In reality it is only relative increases which matter.

Taking relative numbers into account, relative natural population increase has now overtaken the number of immigrants entering the UK.

If immigration rate were constant, and assuming that it is only recent immigrants who are distinguishable from the rest of the population, then a positive net immigration rate would not be an issue. But since the immigration rates are now higher than they were a few years back, there are now (I assume) more people in the country who are more identifiable as an ""immigrant"" than would have been true last year or than would have been true a few years ago.

As for the issue about natural growth, certainly you would expect the figures you quote to increase with increased population. But this is not at all obvious with immigration. In fact, emigration should be expected to increase with increased population; which might make you think that net immigration would go *down* with increases in population. There seems to be me no reason why *immigration* should be correlated with population increase; it would indicate that the country was a more attractive (in whatever sense) location to emigrate to, because it had a natural growth in population due to childbirth? There seems no reason to believe that is true whatsoever.

As for your comment about *relative* figures: absolutely true. A constant net immigration figure is a declining relative one, which should make it less of an issue.

The Pink Paper [reports much the same details](http://news.pinkpaper.com/NewsStory/5936/24/8/2011/Lesbian-raped-by-rickshaw-driver-in-London.aspx) as the [Daily Fail does](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2029269/Lesbian-raped-rickshaw-driver-Murat-Durmus-night-London-gay-club.html). I don't think the Mail piece actually says anything about her being in a gay club or not.

&gt; And nowhere in the story does it say she cites it as proof the sex wasn't consensual...what an absurd conclusion to jump to. So if she was straight it would somehow add credence to a rape?

No, you're quite right, that was lazy of me. I'd read the article a few days ago and I'd wrongly remembered the reasons for her feeling forced to come out and her quote that she was angry and outraged ""because of my orientation"". I was reading between the lines, probably without justification.

true,Haddaway,null,null,"&gt;A positive albeit constant number of net immigrants entering the UK means that each year there are more people who have immigrated into the UK: i.e., all those who were immigrants who entered before this year plus those who entered this year.

Ah, I have been talking about immigrants entering Britain, not the immigrant population as a whole. Yes, the total number of immigrants living in Britain has increased, but as I've already shown, this has recently been overtaken by an even larger increase in natural growth. This results in a lower proportion of immigrants entering Britain relative to the number of childbirths. As you know, this means that the relative number of immigrants living in Britain is now actually falling, not increasing.

&gt;If immigration rate were constant, and assuming that it is only recent immigrants who are distinguishable from the rest of the population, then a positive net immigration rate would not be an issue. But since the immigration rates are now higher than they were a few years back, there are now (I assume) more people in the country who are more identifiable as an ""immigrant"" than would have been true last year or than would have been true a few years ago.

There are also a higher number of people in the country who are prisoners, students, mothers, etc. Basically there are more people in general. We're living in a world with a growing population size, and immigration has as much to do with it as shuffling a pack of cards between countries. Quoting absolute increases in figures says nothing about those increases relative the natural growth of the rest of the population in the country or world as a whole.

&gt; As for the issue about natural growth, certainly you would expect the figures you quote to increase with increased population. But this is not at all obvious with immigration. In fact, emigration should be expected to increase with increased population; which might make you think that net immigration would go down with increases in population. There seems to be me no reason why immigration should be correlated with population increase; it would indicate that the country was a more attractive (in whatever sense) location to emigrate to, because it had a natural growth in population due to childbirth? There seems no reason to believe that is true whatsoever.

As we have already agreed, net immigration is stable. And as the population size increases over time, I would expect both absolute immigration and emigration numbers to both increase. I am confident however that immigration will grow absolutely, not relatively. This is not a surprise any more than the future increase in the total number of toilet paper rolls we can expect to see used by a growing population.

&gt;As for your comment about relative figures: absolutely true. A constant net immigration figure is a declining relative one, which should make it less of an issue. Depending somewhat on exactly what causes people to be upset about it; which I would guess is mostly so damn irrational as to be immune to common sense and statistics.
