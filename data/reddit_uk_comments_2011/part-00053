So why is American healthcare consistently rated as being one of the poorest amongst developed nations?  It's even rated as being poorer than some developing world countries!  Why are so many Americans with insurance being denied treatment over preexisting conditions?  Because it's not profitable to treat them!

Why haven't other privatised sectors achieved ""excellence""?  Plenty to private companies go bust and fail to deliver good customer experience.  Airline and rail industries are good examples of terrible privatised public services.  Even now rail fares have gone up again by about 30%.  Why?  Because they can.

&gt;I'm of the **belief** that it is simply impossible to run an organisation the size of the NHS from a *single provider* efficiently.

You are wrong.  It's been run for quite a while now.  Lots of wealthy nations have public healthcare systems and their populations don't seem to want privatisation or moves towards it, the United States on the other hand...

The UK doesn't have a limitless budget.

I have no idea.  I was also interested to hear they now provide a lump sum (or some sort of extended benefit) for a while after you find work, to help you through the first month or so of no-income 9-5 working.

For years it was very hard for unemployed people without savings to find decent work, because JSA didn't pay enough to actually *save* any money each week, so even once you'd found a salaried job it was all but impossible (at least, without a loan from friends/family, or a humiliating advance on your wages from an understanding new boss) to survive the first week/month with no income or benefits until you got the first paycheque.

&gt; it's Â£14 to get there and back, and Â£14 is a shit load of cash when you're on JSA

Good god - that was pretty much my entire weekly food budget at one point! &lt;:-)

And don't forget to factor in the *additional* amount you need to subtract from your JSA to make up the difference between your housing benefit and your actual rent (assuming you live in anything more ostentatiously swanky than a cardboard box in the local Aldi car-park).

Most people naively think housing benefit *completely covers* your rent, and are shocked and appalled to discover you can easily end up several tenners short each month.

Also this feeds into some thoughts Ive been having. Way back in 'The Pandorica opens' we have all sorts of baddies allying to stop The Doctor.

We see this reinforced later in S6E1 with the Dr1100 vs Dr900 and AGMGTW, where River tells us that the Doctor is a feared warrior. Moffat is setting us up for time line shift.

Futher thoughts, why have visiting hours in a place in which people die in a day, unless.... the people in quarantines are in a slo-time envlope allowing people to visit.

But I will use a quote from Tim Godwin, deputy commisioner of the met, from the inquiry on the riots. 

""â""I take pride in the fact that we filled up prison places instead of hospital beds, and I think that's the British way.""

I think it's easy to forget how we, in comparison to other countries, have an extremely low death rate, offenders are unpredictable, in America, they have guns to fight back with, in England, we have an ASP, and occasionally a taser.  
333 deaths since 1998, I personally don't find that staggering, or any bit surprising at all. In fact, I think that is quite low. The reason I believe there is no convictions, is because the officers involved 'probably' did their job properly and correctly, but there clearly going to be a VERY small few who miss a step or go wrong somewhere, 9 times out of time, accidentally and without intention. If someone dies from them using force, yeah, sure...that's really bad, unfortunate and things need to be looked at, but at the end of the day, the reason the officers haven't been convicted is because they used *reasonable* force, which is hard to define, or even question until you're in the situation the officers are involved in. 

But, any death is definitely in need of investigation, but i'm quite happy to trust the UKs CJS, it's, arguably, the best in the world, and as always still needs more improvement.

16 people dying from causes linked to restraint? In what time period? IF from 1998 still, that isn't exactly shocking, the people being arrested are far from nice people, and if force is being used, there is going to be a damn good reason for it, how does an officer know the person isn't a black belt? Or ex military? Sometimes using alot of force is very necersary, but death is never an option, and that would indicate thhat things went wrong, but unless there was good enough reason to call it intentional or maliciously executed, conviction is going to be the last route.

Some general, basic advice about dealing with landlords:

Some of the following won't help her having already moved into the place, but these are the steps you should always take.

a) Make sure that when you pay the deposit the agreement states that it will be held by an arbitration agency, NOT given immediately to the landlord. This should be standard practice. If they aren't doing this, it's quite suspicious. This goes for agencies and private landlords.

b) She should document the condition of the place when she moves in, or as near as she can to moving in.

c) If they try to keep the deposit, demand (in writing) an itemized rundown for each and every cost that they are paying using the deposit (again, you shouldn't have to ask for this â but do if they don't provide it). Don't be an asshole, but be insistent. They need to have real justification to keep any part of it, much less the whole thing. Any tenancy agreement you sign when you move in (there was a tenancy agreement, right?) should explicitly state the aspects of maitenance that are the landlord's responsibility. Don't let him keep money for anything that isn't **actually wrong** and **actually not his responsibility**.

d) Paperwork is your friend. She should *read* anything she gets handed to sign, keep copies of it, and ask for anything the landlord tells her that's important in writing. *Get it in writing*. This is often (not always) enough to keep the unscrupulous behaviour at bay, just knowing that you have documentation, and that you don't like to be jerked around.",0,1315522862,null,0,false,0,c2ih2aj,t3_k9cuq,t1_c2ih2aj,t3_k9cuq,1428195000,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

The top 1% of wage earners are (comparatively) poor. The real rich in the USA are .1%. This is because there is a much greater income disparity in the USA compared to the UK. Further the .1% who are rich are billionaires; and they own corporations. They shelter the entire cost of their lives through a corporation and thus are only paying taxes at a corporate rate - very often a rate much, much less than the actual assets under their control. 

Additionally, the USA collects taxes not just at the federal level, but at the state and local level as well. Finally there are 'invisible taxes' such as healthcare and social security - which are required pay check deductions in the USA but are not considered to be ""taxes"" despite the fact that they are not 'disposable income'; something that in the UK is provided equally to everybody through larger income taxes than one ""pays"" in the USA - because those 'healthcare"" deductions are said to be voluntary; but I dare you to either decline the benefit or ask your employer for the cash instead. ;-)

If you mean peer as in a Lord x or y, there are very few. There are only a handful of hereditary lords left, and most of them can no longer pass on their peerage to their children.

The majority of peers are 'Life Peers', individuals who are Lords or Baronesses until they die and have no effect on their children. Every single Lord in government or politics you may hear of will be one of these, often because a party wants a non-MP in their cabinet, or because they are uneelected but offer special knowledge (having doctors, teachers, union workers who could not otherwise get elected contributing to legislation has its advantages).


More generally class is **much** more a question of self-identification. Social mobility hinders it, but there is nothing stopping people moving between classes. I know a fair few people from the generation above me who were working class born and bred but are now 'middle class'.


In terms of nobility envy it's almost non existant. Most people would be **extremely** embarrassed to bring up a family member who was a peer or other nobility just for status; it would be seen as an attempt to ride on the coattails of your ancestors, which you have done nothing to deserve. This is doubly so given that most people either have no hereditary status (because they are immigrants) or because they don't know it.

There have only been a handful of times that peerage has been brought up amongst people I know. Once because someone was related to a Lord such and such who was colonel of a particular military regiment (which is more like an american saying they were related to general custer or somesuch; the peerage is only relevant because at that time in history **only** peers would have such a rank), and another as a curiosity, in the same way that americans sometimes bring up that they have Irish or Scottish ancestry.

Iran is a tricky one, we often ignore the tensions between the Arabs and the Persians, but it's important. In Iraq, both the Saudi's and Persians were funding/training/supplying insurgent forces.

The thing that I dislike about NIF (and laser ICF in general) is that it is inherently pulse-based. Now ITER is also planned to be pulse based (but much longer pulses) whilst the stellarator method (as championed by the Wendelstein models in Germany) are the only ones which aren't pulse based (and there are a few private little ones like Polywell, Focus Fusion etc. that might not be..).

I understand that the internal combustion engine is also pulse based and works fine, but in order to generate a decent amount of power (energy PER TIME) you need a lot of rapid pulses in NIF, which means the lasers need to be able to be ready to fire again extremely quickly and you need to be able to construct pellets (with the complicated hohlraum) at a rapid rate (this probably isn't an issue)

Another issue (admittedly not proven to be fully solved in the ITER MCF tokamak track either) is how to create sufficient tritium for the pellets on a large scale. ITER plans to use lithium in a jacket on the walls which is then irradiated by the neutrons ejected from the plasma and forms tritium which is fed back in whilst the unwanted fusion products (i.e. the helium 'ash') are fed out via the divertor.

true,[deleted],null,null,"Okay, I'll rise to that as a devil's advocate - but I'll ramble a bit as ideas come to mind.

The biggest issue with laser fusion as a viable alternative source of power, is the amount and speed that fusion ignitions have to happen. To cite the article itself,

&gt; ""a functioning laser power plant would need to cycle through more than 10 fuel pellets each second - a million each day. Nif, since its completion in 2009, has undertaken only 305 such shots in its quest for ignition.""

Where do you even begin to create the engineering processes for such a plant? So we build 10 laser fusion devices, per plant (each handling one ignition, per second). You still run into huge engineering problems which one would find practically impossible to solve. Not to mention, 10 sets of lasers all drawing their own amounts of power.

Then the cost of building these plants won't be cheap, and you'll need more than one. You'll need a very highly trained and specialised workforce to maintain, design, create and enhance these facilities. And a similar motley crew to create the fuel pellets (10 million *successful* ignition pellets per day, per plant).

What happens to these lasers as they degrade with time? The power delivered to the ignition cell will be reduced and you might have failed ignitions causing further issues on the whole ""10 per second"" target. How long will it take a laser to burn out to the point when it needs replaced? Is there a net energy gain in the process of building and distributing the laser?

The actual pellets used for ignition are difficult to process and make compared to other sources of fuel (coal, thorium, uranium) - the hydrogen isotopes need to be manufactured.

How much will average Joe be willing to pay for electricity that originated from laser fusion, given the costs of all the technical challenges I've listed.

The big problem with pellet production is getting the tritium, ITER will do this automatically from the lithium in the walls of the reactor that is neutron bombarded as the process starts (obviously we need a small amount to start the process but we can obtain that from sea water). Here it is a bigger problem, and I don't think getting it from sea water would be energy efficient.

That said, I don't think the manufacturing itself would be too troublesome so long as the above issue is solved, as with modern automation techniques it could be done in the plant.

I still think ITER and the Stellarator are much more promising though.

The real problem is that they depend on economies of scale, this is very apparent in the construction of ITER.

When I first started working in IT, I was a paid up card carrying geek (still am), but I had very little idea how the job of low-level IT monkey was done, and even less of an idea about how businesses operated. And although I did a fine art degree, I noticed the same with that, we learned the academic theory behind the art world, but even the best of us had no idea how to turn the degree into a career. 

And businesses seem to agree, we quite often hear the CBI or similar complaining that the calibre of graduate is simply not high enough, and that even the best will require months of babysitting before they can be allowed to function independently. But on the flip side, we are hearing growing complaints that education is becoming nothing short of a factory for clerks, that we are losing the wonder of learning just because we want to know. Both positions are right, and it stems back to rolling polytechnics and universities into one.",0,1315575519,null,0,false,0,c2ilqpg,t3_k9t91,t1_c2ilqpg,t1_c2ilmyc,1427578056,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

Having a gun makes him potentially dangerous but lets not pretend that englands some victorian utopia full of gentlemen and guns dont exist within the community. A few years ago a young lad in Liverpool was shot and killed by other young lads and on that episode it may be fair to say guns seem to be ubiquitous within certain communities. If young kids can get hold of them I suspect they are probably fairly widely available.

Still carrying a gun doesnt make you an imminent threat unless you aim it at someone. It makes you a potential threat and that doesnt entitle the police to execute you imo.

The initial story that came out was he was involved in an operation trident operation because he was out to avenge an attack on his cousin, hence why he was being followed. The IPCC initially claimed he was involved in a shootout, and that he fired a bullet that was lodged into a police radio this was immediately fed to the press, they have now fully retracted this as it was a load of made up bollocks, a complete fantasy. The taxi was removed from the area, why, where did it go and what happened to it and who ordered that, are they still in a job because as far as I'm concerned thats tampering with the scene of a crime, its further undermined the police case, whoever ordered that should be charged appropriately and removed from service.

I suspect the police screwed up, shot a guy who probably wasn't about to commit a crime, have tried to cover up the evidence and have been found out. i know its not an easy job being a policeman and I accept mistakes, wrong decisions are taken and the rest, but the impact of shooting someone dead impacts everyone around them, particularly this guy's children and his family whose lives will now go on freeze frame until all the enquiries are complete, we could be talking many years.

The case of the brazilian terrorist tube station gate vaulter, which never happened should be clear enough to everyone that the MET have a history of lying through their teeth to save their own backs, take away their uniform and they are simply civil servants. They are a corrupt organisation, they have an improper relationship with the media, a u scratch my back relationship, they are an institutionally racist organisation, they have a lying through their teeth. 

I dont trust them for a single second. 

I think the only way forward in future is if they have to shoot someone in similar circumstances, they must provide supporting video evidence to show why that was necessary and all communications must be recorded and documented immediately after the event. 

I'll say it again if he aimed that gun at anyone and or threatened life, I would support the shooting, there is no evidence so far that that happened, in fact the evidence looks the the police want you to believe but it never happened at all.",0,1315577749,null,0,false,0,c2ilz5s,t3_k8pyo,t1_c2ilz5s,t1_c2ilj7j,1427578176,0,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,0

I don't know exactly how it works but I would be shocked if it is not supposed to be based on your *yearly* wage and calculated in a cumulative fashion like your income tax.

Do you have a proper tax code or are you on an emergency one? An easy way to tell is if you're getting a straight ~20% taken every week, even on the lower paid weeks, with no reference to personal allowances. Your tax code should be on your pay slip and you can probably find out more on the direct.gov website. 

In general the income tax is worked out in a cumulative way starting from the beginning of the financial year in April. What they do is add up all of your earnings for each week and see how it relates to what you've already paid in tax and the personal allowance level at that week (roughly your personal yearly allowance/52*number of weeks).

School attendance linked to the government has already been done with EMA, and that worked quite well, at least I didn't hear of any legitimate problems, idiots would complain they didn't have any money, but never went into school for a few days and didn't bother handing forms in/sending the wrong ones in. Working with the schools, like they did with EMA, would make this work. 

If the parents are well off, taking away benefits they clearly don't need is a good thing, when they can't afford the cocktails, then they'll soon get their kids into school. If they don't miss the money, and the kid doesn't go school, nothing has changed and the government has saved some money. 

The cost of truancy? Disruption in schools because kids haven't got a clue what they've been learning, and will require more of the teachers time, which definitely affects other students. 

Not everybody is scum who doesn't give a toss what happens with their kids, some parents just let it slide due to work/stress/whatever, this would stop that truancy. If parents can afford to let their kid not go school, great, saves a lot of money.

This is certainly a better alternative to prison like some parents get.

I've known friends that work in the city and they are all required to sit a programming/logic test of some form. Most companies make you sit tests.

Almost all the students in my year that got a first sat advanced algorithms and some form of hard AI course nearly all of them (something like 90%) had also done a placement year, all of them had some interest in CS outside of their course and all of the ones I know now have decent jobs and got them before they even got their grades. 

Of my friends I know that got 2:1s and 2:2s most of the ones that have jobs also had an interest outside of the course and they were able to demonstrate this in their CV and in interviews.

It really depends on the person, you must have things your ready to fight for or your life probably isn't worth living. So that's why I will say that the only real debate about war is around the circumstances you would be ready to go to war over. For some it will be the default response to the slightest provocation, and for others it would be the point where the other side are mere blocks away from your house and there is no one left to defend you.

I understand your point about legitimacy from the point of middle easterners, that is valid. But I don't think that was why the wars went badly. While most Iraqi's weren't that happy to see the Americans/British arrive, they did quite like that Saddam had gone. And we had a 3 month window of good grace from them, which we wasted by failing to provide basic security, water, power and jobs, which was compounded by de-baathifcation. Had we sent in 2x as many troops to secure the nation, along with releife organizations and civilian police things would have worked out better. 

Afghanistan is a little different, because once you get outside the big towns the population is pretty much medieval. They are so far behind us culturally that it's very hard to have a common point of reference culturally. They have a different way of thinking to us, and tbh just want to be left alone by everyone. That war has lost it's focus completely, tbh we should just focus on eliminating the Taliban and then leave them alone.

It's a geolinguistic quirk. 

In Ireland, we tend to say 'wardrobe' for what Americans call a closet (a tall, freestanding or wall-attached piece of furniture in which you may hang full-length garments).

We say 'press' most of the time for cupboard (cupboard has always sounded very British to my ears, but we do use it occasionally).

And, in my family at least, I don't know about others, Hitler would be in a 'cloakroom', since it was a small room with a door, and not a piece of furniture, and it had provision for hanging coats and shelves for other garments.

If the room into which Hitler was locked had contained mainly bed linen, with a heat source such as a hot water storage cylinder, or a radiator, I would have called it a 'hotpress'.

true,rbobby,canada,Canada,"The rules vary quite a bit by country (even within a country by state/province). For the UK this might help get you started: http://www.direct.gov.uk/en/Employment/TradeUnions/index.htm

Translation may or may not even be eligible for unionization... there's literally a ton of legislation and regulation around unionization. Only a well qualified lawyer would be able to provide concrete legal advice on what is/is not within the scope of legislation (which would require money... but if 20 people each kicked in 500gbp then getting a lawyer involved would be trivial... though finding a _good_ one would still be difficult).

Generally (in Canada/US) the easiest method is for a group of employees to join an existing union. To do this the employee's must be hourly employees (not salary or contract/freelance) and an organizing vote must take place (50% of the employees agree to join a union). The organization activities enjoy certain legal protections... but large companies often skirt the law (or even violate it) to ensure the vote fails (Walmart could be considered an exemplar of this... they even closed a store after its workers successfully unionized).

For the situation you've described the translators may need to create a new trade union. Not sure how that would work. Here's another link: http://www.acas.org.uk/media/pdf/b/j/A02_1.pdf

They might need to act pretty quickly... once ALS is up and running and all translation services are being provide via ALS then likely only the employee's of ALS would be able to form a union (ie. I don't think a group of ""unemployed"" people can just start a union).

Regardless though the key to all this is convincing sufficient people that they need some form of collective bargaining assistance. That can be pretty difficult because you're dealing with lots and lots of individuals (herder meet cats, cats meet herder) and it is not uncommon for the first thing a new union does is to go on strike (ie. everyone stops getting a paycheck... stops being able to pay bills... etc etc).

I don't know that that's a solution, and I think ""younger and younger"" is a populist exaggeration (when actually ""teenagers"" is meant) but I kinda think a valid point is being made here.

I generally tend to think that the internet should be a playground, and the the government should keep its nose out of the internet, but the wider population now sees the internet as an ""entertainment medium"" - they see it as Facebook and YouTube and the Arsenal FC or fishing forums, Amazon and RyanAir for buying your holidays.

Most parents don't have a concept of watching their kids all the time - I guess one cannot deny that a large aspect of parenting is about putting food on the table and making sure that food is on the table, but there are aspects of internet use that are completely overlooked. Realistically, the internet is a huge influence on kids' sexual educations and mores these days, yet parents just look at it the same as watching TV when we were kids - we watched the odd horror movie after 9pm and it never hurt us.

Meanwhile there are plenty of youngsters on reddit who have been surfing 4chan since they were 13 or 14 years old, and have become immunised to the nastiest porn and gore.

I wouldn't want to see 4chan banned completely, and I suspect there are many youngsters who have been exposed to it since 13 or 14 years old and yet who, five years later, are better adjusted and more together than many of their ""more innocent"" peers, but I kinda see there's an issue here.

I suspect the issue would be *better addressed* by making every parent take an introductory course in how to see nasty shit on the internet the year their kid turns 10, but realistically you can't do that. Most people are stupid, so the only result of making them realise how easily smut is accessed on the net would be for them to turn back around and say ""why isn't the government doing something?""",0,1315589791,null,0,false,0,c2inm61,t3_ka314,t1_c2inm61,t1_c2in5yu,1427579078,7,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,7

Yes, the solicitors would have had to waive their fees had they lost. Yes, they have to make up their losses on the averages, but these larger fees are not taken out of the pockets of the litigants.

The second track of the two pronged approach is laser confinement, which is being pursued by Europe at the HiPER facility currently under being planned (or perhaps they have started construction, I forget..), and at NIF by the Americans (and now us).

It might seem redundant to be members of both NIF and HiPER but this isn't really the case as it allows experiments to be checked in different settings and to run experiments in parallel - we should really have several ITER's too, but sadly the world is not run by enlightened men..

In fact, JET has just finished a major upgrade to test ITER like tungsten walls (previously it had carbon) and is now starting to run plasmas again (it was shut down during the upgrade - which was carried out by awesome robotic arms, they have a video on their website of them playing jenga with them).

Do you think this off tattoos with band names or songs too? Or maybe mathematical figures and proofs? How about a simple omega or pi? Or tattoos in general? Unless, of course, it does not have any real meaning for you and is just there to look cool. Then it is totally okay because then you won't stop loving it in a couple of years.

Some people define themselves and find new parts of how they think about the world in art. It might be music, tv-series, movies, books, math, nature or anything really that touches you. A lot of these people tend to do great things because they are driven by a love for something they want to explore. Many mathematicians have created beatifull proofs for the most complex things only because of such a love for something which other think of boring.

Only because your world view is so limited and your experiences are lacking does not mean that everyone else is like that. I know people that get the same look in their eyes today when they talk about The Twilight Zone as they did back when it first aired. These are respected people in respected fields of higher education whom one of them actually have a Twilight Zone tattoo. He still loves it to this day because that episode touched him in a way. It reminds him of so much and he cherries it.

And the real world you talk about; you are welcome to visit it sometime when you get of your high horses.

You know what I really though when I read your comment at first?

I imagine their teachers and staff could do a lot with very little, at the end of the day a teacher relies on his knowledge and in some cases has a textbook of some nature to help guide students. 

I think some of the lessons they have learnt from their independence will be transferable to the state sector, they won't be able to make every student reach the same level as their own school but they'll certainly be able to help the situation.

Everyone is really caught up with this whole rhotic-non-rhotic divergence. 

[This map shows (in the 1950s before mass immigration and urbanisation had a more profound effect on accents) the areas in the UK with rhotic accents](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:RhoticEngland.png)

Any of you who have traveled around our country in the slightest will appreciate that there are absolutely **huge** differences in accents between those places.

The colonial accent would definitely have **one** similarity with most modern American accents, but it doesn't seem possible to determine what it **actually** sounded like. For all we know it could have sounded like any number of accents in the modern uk in all but rhoticity.


The only point that we can be sure of is that **some** American words are older than British ones. 'Fall' for Autumn, Aluminum, and various other words that we see as Americanisms remained in the US due to its inherent conservatism whilst it changed across the broader empire (India and the words colonials brought back from it had a particular influence). 

The only exception to the above are usually geographic words. Many many words were invented or adapted from french dutch or the regional native american dialect, because the american continent had geographical features that the english language at the time simply could not describe adequately.

there are a ton of farmer's markets in the area that operate on different days if you're looking for cheap prices and high quality, local produce. wholefoods and trader joe's are your best bets for healthy stuff that won't have chemicals, but they're going to be a bit pricier (especially whole foods).

dive bars? OOOO BABY you're in luck.

I HIGHLY recommend Joey Mac's (23 Warren Street off of Cambridge street in east cambridge) for it's amazing divey atmosphere and wide assortment of fascinating characters. don't go in here hungry though because they don't serve food (sometimes the delivery guy from the local pizza shop brings in some pies after his shift on saturdays)

other bars i frequent are The Field (corner of mass ave and prospect, central square), Miracle of Science (321 mass ave near MIT), and my home away from home Bukowskis (1281 cambridge st, Inman Square).

all of cambridge street has incredible food, lots of traditional Indian places as well as cantoneese, brazil bbq, southern grub, traditional italian (try the East Side in East cambridge!) and a smathering of local seafood and sandwich places.

for nightlife I'd go to the Enormous Room (actually really small, 569 Mass Ave, Central Square) or the Mecca of local rock itself, The Middle East (480 Mass Ave, with multiple venues under one roof) as well as shows at TT the Bears and the All Asia, both within spitting distance of the Mid East.

cambridge has a lot to see, eat, drink and experience. check out the shops in Harvard Square and take a trip out to Mt. Auburn Cemetary and stroll the beautiful graves of famous people that your teacher made you read in high school. pour one out for my main dawg, B.F. Skinner.

The fact that this woman is suprised at under 16s asking about sex is ridiculous. Try to remember that scene in Jurassic Park when Jeff Goldblum is insisting that *life finds a way*. Well, that reality is exactly the same for my friends and pornography. Anyone suggesting otherwise is just plain naive. If she merely wants to prevent kids learning about sex at an early age, she won't, but that type of software exists on search engines.

The problem with this outlook is that sex shouldn't be a taboo subject. When my parents found out I was looking at porn they didn't shun me away and shame me for natural urges. It was rolling eyes and light laughter. Just because I've seen people have sex and know about different kinks and positions hasn't corrupted me into some deviant manwhore.

Pornography has, to my knowledge, never changed anyone's characters for the worst, looking at my friends and the people in schoolyears below me. The idea that we'll be able to fuck at 16 but not look at porn for two years is stupid.

Have you spent much time with teachers? The amount of materials needed for any in depth course is surprisingly large and as lessons now try and integrate literacy, numeracy and IT you find a lot of cross curricula work.

The difference between a school in an affluent area and one in a poor area can be vast when it comes to IT infrastructure, music equipment, sports equipment, access to playing fields etc.

Eton has the ability to attract the very best teachers (and like all professions there is a huge range of ability) and then supply them with as much equipment as they need. You also get the bonus of smaller class sizes and potentially more time to prepare as the school can afford to maintain a higher staffing level. With a sufficiently high staffing level a teacher can have less teaching hours which allows for one to one tuition and more in depth lesson planning.

Eton also has the advantage of a generally higher quality of intake and a greater scope for discipline.

There will definitely be transferable skills but I'd be amazed if they get equivalent results.

In Silence/Forest she was a strange character from the Doctor's distant future.  She described fantastical events and a much older, more powerful doctor who carried a sonic screwdriver both more advanced yet still so ancient that it already looked like an artifact.

Then when we saw her again we were given this new concept. The idea of them meeting backwards.  She had a diary with all his faces so the idea of her being this nonstandard companion who showed up once or twice a season and ranged 3 or 4 different Doctors missing seasons occasionally with a younger actress every few seasons to show the reverting age.  It was a cool idea and a really neat new recurring character.

Then she was a major part of the season but I was like, ""oh whatever.  They're establishing who she is, that's fine.""  When they gave her [spoiler](/s ""the ability to regenerate I was like ""Ok, so they can change out actors like the Doctor.  It's still good."")  But then Lets Kill Hitler happened and they basically left her physically within 5 years of the age she is in Silence in the Library (we've seen she ages at normal human rate) and almost every single fantastic thing she mentioned resolved.  She can only possibly have a season or 2 left before the character is done.

That assumes the revenue is mutually exclusive.  Just because it's less doesn't mean they don't deserve it. ( I don't actually know how much it is)

&gt;  by the way ad revenue wont change if a couple thousand people world-wide torrent it. they will make the same amount of money either way

That assumes it's only a couple thousand.  We don't really know so we shouldn't assume it has a small impact.  It's called the Tragedy of the Commons. Also the more it's condoned and advertised like through upvotes on a torrent the more people who will pirate rather than pay for it otherwise.

[EDIT] It's hard to get BBCA ratings but [this](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/04/25/doctor-who-ratings-break-_n_853567.html) implies the new season tops the series at 1.3M.  So 13k pirated copies (where it wasn't paid for otherwise) is 1% less revenue.

Also, via Amazon the revenue is going to be the same regardless and it's non trivial.  I believe on iTunes at lease Apple only takes 30% for serving costs, so BBCA would still get $1-$2 an episode.

Most of the time though (for economics, maths, English ect) the teachers involvement will be in a discussion, presentation or writing something on a white board, something which every school  has.

I'm not sure about the claim that private school teachers have less lesson time than state schools, it seems like they have more on their plate as they are often involved in extra curricular activities. 

The high quality of intake undoubtedly helps, I think you have misunderstood what I meant, I meant that private schools would be able to transfer some of their knowledge and successes, not produce matching results.  (ie improve the situation, not expect Eton level results).

Well, they aren't sunglasses - they filter the exact green wavelength the laser diode immits.

Because 1 watt laser WILL blind you if it enters your pupil. (the 125mW lasers I use can damage eyesight). There is **no time** for the blink reflex, and the retina will be permanently damaged after a micro second or two. If it hits your fovea centralis, you will never be able to read text in that eye again. (that's the high resolution bit of the eye you point at a book when you're reading.

Even specular reflections (imagine shining a torch at a silver bowl, the light that reflects in the same intensity as the torch beam hitting it is specular reflection... the diffuse reflection which is safer is like when the torch beam reflects from a cushion, lighting the area around it) from a 1 watt laser can easily blind. That's the main reason it comes with the eye protection - if you shine it around a kitchen, there's a thousand small highly reflective surfaces that will shine a specular reflection right back at you! It's like a room of spikey blinding reflections...

true,Blaidd_Dwrg,eng-lancashire,Preston,"I'm trying to work out how margarine differs from vegetable oil spreads. According to wikipedia:

&gt; Margarine as a generic term, can indicate any of a wide range of butter substitutes.

&gt; The basic method of making margarine today consists [...] of emulsifying a blend of purified vegetable oils with skim milk, chilling the mixture to solidify it and working it to improve the texture.

&gt; Alternatively, solid fats can be manufactured from oils by converting animal or vegetable oils by passing hydrogen through the oil in the presence of a nickel catalyst, under controlled conditions. The addition of hydrogen to the unsaturated bonds (alkenic double C=C bonds) results in saturated C-C bonds, effectively increasing the melting point of the oil and thus ""hardening"" it.

&gt; In the United Kingdom there are no brands of spread on sale which contain any partially hydrogenated oils. Although fortification with vitamins A and D is still mandatory for margarine, it is only a voluntary requirement for other spreads.

true,G_Morgan,cnty-wales,Wales,"Yes and most margarines have a high quantity opposite chirality fats. Interestingly they aren't all equal in this. There was a study that showed some brands are better than others.

The problem is all natural products are made from an enzyme chain that goes throughout the food chain. 99% of organic isomers have the same chirality because it is all constructed using very specific mechanisms. Then the body is also very good at breaking down molecules of one chirality but not the other. All of evolution has worked assuming optical isomerism is not an issue because we'll just construct all isomers to be of the same chirality.

From a pure chemical perspective, one optical isomer is as good as another. The raw chemical processes make a 50/50 split. Leaving 50% the body can deal with easily and 50% which just gets stored while the body says ""WTF?"". Enzymes work because they have structures that bind to a molecule in a particular way that allows it easy access to the points where it can break down a molecule. They are very specifically tied to molecule structure, not basic chemical properties. When you have a molecule that is chemically identical but is a mirror image the enzyme is just useless.

The thing I loved about River is that I expected to see character growth in reverse. I expected her to earn her smug attitude. Now it turns out she was born with it.

She had no inner life in LKH.

* She hates the Doctor because he *doesn't save enough people*? What? There are so many other better reasons to not like the Doctor (he doesn't have to take ""the long road,"" he doesn't deal with the damage he leaves behind, he favors Earth and doesn't really care, say, that the Sontarans lost their breeding planet). If you were going to brainwash someone to hate the Doctor, would you convince them that the Doctor does a shitload of good things, but not enough of them?

* She is best friends with Amy, who loves the Doctor, but hardly argues with her about it? (""Amy, he left you and never came back... he stops by and saves people but doesn't deal with the damage afterward..."")

* She lives her whole life around killing the Doctor, and when she meets him, she's like ""oh hay, 'sup?""

* She hasn't prepared a speech for the man she's been preparing to kill her whole life, but just says, basically, ""I'mma kill you now... after I check out my bewbs""?

* She overturns everything she ever knew about the Doctor, destroying the Kovarians' best chance to win the war they've devoted their lives to fighting? (I wanted to see: ""Madame Kovarian, he's not as bad as you think! We don't need to destroy him, we can reform him!"")

The robotech masters were defeated first by the sheer resources of the Galactic Empire, who then adapted protoculture, particle beam technology, and 'disposable' space-superiority mecha.
The empire quickly wasted the Peacekeepers with negligible loss of resources, and got the wormhole technology when Scorpius submitted himself to be a Sith apprentice to Palpatine, provided the Scarrans were exterminated. 
The Empire expanded until treading into Borg space. The Borg spread backward like a disease and reduced the empire to a ragged fleet of Super Star Destroyers (and the Death Star mk.4)that just wouldn't die. The Queen REALLY wanted to assimilate Palpatine and Scorpius. So, The Borg resorted to using temporal warfare against them, until they opened a rift to a void outside of time. Oops, Daleks. Three-way battle, temporal warfare, massive losses all around, and noone has the juice left to escape when Unicron takes notice and sends the entire Decepticon Armada to wipe out everything in space.

I just feel like with series 5 and 6, Moffat is pretty much forcing us to follow the lives of the companions.  I'm not saying that Rory and Amy aren't great companions, but it just feels like the show revolves around them, and the Doctor is more of a supporting character (Even the new intro is Amy talking about how she met her imaginary friend.)

I might have been getting a bit off topic, but essentially what I'm saying is that there is waaaaaay too much story going on.  It's like I'm watching a time-travely soap opera instead of Doctor Who.

true,looksfamiliar,null,null,"Yes, they are a by-product.  The result of hydrogenation, well, partial hydrogenation:

&gt;The process of hydrogenation adds hydrogen atoms to unsaturated fats, eliminating double bonds and making them into partially or completely saturated fats. However, partial hydrogenation, if it is chemical rather than enzymatic, converts a part of cis-isomers into trans-unsaturated fats instead of hydrogenating them completely.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trans_fat

And that partial hydrogenation is to get the consistency you want, cheaply, through an industrial process.

&gt;Changing the degree of saturation of the fat changes some important physical properties such as the melting range, which is why liquid oils become semi-solid. Solid or semi-solid fats are preferred for baking because the way the fat mixes with flour produces a more desirable texture in the baked product. Because partially hydrogenated vegetable oils are cheaper than animal source fats, they are available in a wide range of consistencies, and have other desirable characteristics

true,jawnn,lfc12,,"-Happy we had an overall command of the game, but then again, it's Stoke. Not exactly known for wowing crowds with their totaalvoetballllll..

- Pope Lucas made a sicko slide tackle from behind which surely left whoever caught it from behind really question his abilities, completely cleaned 'em out and passed it away where most players woulda taken a leg off.

- Stewart Frowning wasn't as sharp today, and I think he needs to just stay on the left, he pairs up with Enrique well and it's CSuarez preferred side as well, he does more dangerous stuff in general on the left.

- Bellendamy (had to come up with that one now, haven't titled him yet) should have came on for Hendo immediately after he missed those 3 shots. Hendo's game overall was pretty bad, and his shooting was worse. Hendo has a lot to learn, and I'm hoping he's not consistently mediocre, because it appears he's cemented a spot in the starting XI. I feel that Maxipad's been cheated and he has Hendo to blame for it.

- Gappie Adam's worst game by far. Someone needs to tell him to ease up defensively, because he's conceding WAY too many fouls. With the way the calls went, he easily coulda got a straight red today OR two yellows - he's lucky he didn't. In attempt to make up for his lack of pace, he's often too physical. Most of is it unnecessary, at one point when he made a tackle today he had his hand on the back of some guys neck as he was shoving him; that's literally a display of how he's consciously allowing for people to be victims rather than just dispossessed IMO..Lucas could teach him a thing or two.

- Our man Cannibal Suarez DID miss two shots that I thought he should have made, but both did require quick thinking and supreme accuracy based on the flow of the moment. Aside from that, he was forced to play fairly deep, as he and Enrique were seemingly the only two who were eager to get forward.

- Passing was astray, and the silky smooth football we played just weeks ago was completely missing today. 

- Andy Carrale's positioning is gonna give me aneurysm.

- Good to see Glenjamin back, although I still feel Maxi coulda came on instead, Squirtle wasn't doing terribly, I actually felt he was getting forward more than the likes of UpperKuyt and Frowning at times - but it was probably more to get him some minutes rather than because of an at-loss Squirtle.

Damn. Stoke aren't good enough for us to play well apparently, they're JUST bad enough for us to struggle. United, Chelsea? Smashed. West Ham, Stoke? *hide*

Oh, btw. How the FK can someone be dragged down from behind and land on his chest with a player standing behind him? Just like Flana's conceded penalty, the damn Stoke man HURLED himself at Carra, who was offbalance and keeping his footing, but because he had his hands within 600 yards of the attacker it was a pen.

German History ( All on Nov 9th) 

1848: After being arrested in the Vienna revolts, liberal leader Robert Blum is executed. The execution is often seen as a symbolic event for the ultimate failure of the Revolutions of 1848 in the German states.

1918: Monarchy in Germany ends when Emperor Wilhelm II is dethroned in the November Revolution. Philipp Scheidemann proclaims the Weimar Republic from a window of the Reichstag. Two hours later Karl Liebknecht proclaims a ""Free Socialist Republic"" from a balcony of the Berliner Stadtschloss. Der 9. November (The Ninth of November) is the title of a novel by Bernhard Kellermann published in Germany that told the story of the German insurrection of 1918.

1923: The Beer Hall Putsch (8-9 November) marks the emergence of the Nazi Party as an important player on Germany's political landscape.

1938: In the Kristallnacht, (9-10 November) synagogues and Jewish property are burned and destroyed on a large scale. More than 1,300 Jews are killed.

1989: The fall of the Berlin Wall ends German separation and starts a series of events that ultimately lead to the German reunification. 9 November was considered as the date for German Unity Day, but as it was also the anniversary of Kristallnacht, this date was considered inappropriate as a national holiday. The date of the formal reunification of Germany, 3 October 1990, therefore, was chosen as the date for the holiday instead.

Thus the British [November 9th Society](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/November_9th_Society)

As for us: we had several individual poor performances and showed that Kenny's team is still a work in progress.

Carragher: His mistake cost the game, and these mistakes are starting to creep in more often. He is approaching the end of his career, and if Coates settles in it will be Carra who makes way. It may be that, with fewer games, Carra can be a valuable player still. Sami Hyypia made a huge contribution even after it was clear he wasn't going to be starting 40+ games a season any more. Other than the mistake, of course, he was OK.

Skrtl: Not a full-back, although he's clearly having fun in the role. It looked like Johnson reinjured himself, but we need Kelly or Flanagan back ASAP.

Adam: Pretty dire, really. He might think he can split the defence with an amazing pass every time, but he can't. He should stop trying to impress, and start retaining possession. He'll lose his place to Gerrard I think.

Henderson: I see him as a little like Lucas a few years back - it'll take a little more time for him to develop his potential, and I hope the pressure of the unfair criticism he's getting doesn't weigh too heavily on him. It wouldn't be a problem for the team if Adam wasn't misfiring next to him.

Downing: I've always thought his final ball was a bit dodgy - a weak shot or a good-looking cross to nobody - and there was a bit of that today. But the rest of his play is so very, very good. There was some very clever play with Suarez that looked our most likely chance of a break through.

Bellamy: Wow. Nice to have him back. He might prove to be as good a signing as Suarez (with Downing not far behind).

Carroll: surrounded by nine defenders all the time he was on, he couldn't do much.

* As others have said, Rory waited 2000 years. The thing is, Rory *knew* what he was waiting for. He knew the Doctor was going to put things right. He knew Amy was going to live again. Old Amy had no such assurances. Like she said to young Amy, they just got in the box and flew away.

* I can't imagine that the easy friendship that Amy, Rory and the Doctor have enjoyed on the Tardis up til now will recover in the space between this episode and the next.

I actually found it fascinating, this recurring theme of isolation breeding anger and hatred in DW. It really goes to support the Doctor's need for companions - that love and companionship, romantic or platonic, is what gives us our humanity - and what helps keep away the darkness of the Doctor.

I mean, we've seen Ten without a companion, and he does not cope well. And Turn Left explicitly shows us that if he had been without Donna, he would have ended up dead, overcome by his rage and none of her humanity to stop him. Not to mention the whole destroying the Time Lords (presumably with no companion). 

But I don't think Amy necessarily went ""crazy."" She was driven to be hard and bitter, fending for herself for 36 years.

For a start, we'd lose the right to work and travel, without the need for a visa or residence permit, in the remaining 26 countries of the EU. 

British companies would lose the right to export products and services freely in the EU. Given that most of our exports go to European countries, this would mean job losses and shrinking markets.

As a result lots of companies, would move their headquarters and centers of production,  or at least scale down their presence in the UK. The number of EU nationals currently living and studying in the UK would also drop and many British citizens working abroad would have to return.   

Investors holding sterling assets in Britain might prefer transferring money out of Britain and into France or Germany or another Eurozone country. The pound might fall as a result and prices would rise, stoking inflation.

We could probably sign agreements with the EU to keep our existing  rights, but we'd most likely have to pay for the privilege (probably  the equivalent of what we pay in contribution to the EU's budget). The downside would be losing our voting rights in the Council of Ministers, the European Parliament, and the European Commission. So we would lose the ability to influence EU policy but would still be indirectly affected by it.

In a way, that could've been the same principle.  The Troclafane were from a timeline in which a tenth of their ancestors weren't killed by themselves; they were kept alive and kept in a timeline where they could murder away by the Paradox Machine.  In other words, inhabitants of one timeline were able to live in and interact with the inhabitants of another timeline.

The Mythbusters were sent into a dark room with light-accustomed eyes and were told to complete certain objectives. Their movements were hampered by the darkness and it took them five minutes to finish. When they went into a rearranged but equally dark room with an eye that was covered for thirty minutes, the Mythbusters were able to complete the test in a fraction of the time. As a control test, the Mythbusters then went back into the same exact room with light-accustomed eyes and ran into the same difficulty as the first test. The myth was deemed plausible because there is no recorded historical precedent for this myth.

And he had a point.  Okay, not *every* episode, but Forest of the Dead, Midnight, The Big Bang, Voyage of the Dammned, Journey's End, A Christmas Carol, etc. all resolve themselves by having one character sacrifice themselves at the end to make everything else right again.

Green Anchor = Visitors, uninfected beings, time moves normally. 
Red Waterfall = Patients, infected beings, time relative to Green moves quickly. 

If I'm a patient, I have 24 hour plague.  That's 24 hours that I as the infected perceive.  So I have one day to visit the areas of Two-Streams facilities, then I die?

A visitor goes into the green visiting room,  that's where The Doctor &amp; Rory are, I assume it's the visitor area as the handbook asks how long they'll be visiting.   So if I look in on a time stream that's moving faster than the one I'm in why wouldn't it be really fast when viewed from the Green room?

Let's assume that the view glass buffers the red side and feeds it back to the green side in what the green side perceives as realtime.  Doesn't that mean that a visitor in the green room would only have 24 hours of stuff from the red side?  And how would two way communication be possible at all given the lag?

Or am I looking at this all wrong?  Does someone in the red side perceive a whole lifetime as the virus still progresses in green time of 24 hours?

- River Song is their daughter

- The Doctor is the reason why Amy was imprisoned, and their daughter was taken and raised to be a psychopathic killer trained to kill the Doctor

Her suffering was over, and she secured Amy's happiness(at least for a time) I felt bad, but I wasn't over come with emotion. There have been many more much sadder moments in Dr Who history. This showed me how brave Amy was, and also how much of a bitch she can be considering Rory waited 1thousand years for her. In the end no one died. Maybe its because I have seen a lot of Time travel pieces of film or show where one version is destroyed when the correct version survives an event. It just didn't do anything for me. Rory Dying and Amy forgetting him was worse.

EDIT: In fact this entire idea was played upon in the Doctors wife. While Amy and Rory were separated and having tricks played upon them, Rory up and dies in the course of 3 minutes with Amy having to run from him and then see his corpse when he only cursed her seconds before.

(and of course, he's not going to stay dead. The question is *how* will he come back, but I guarantee Moffat is going to make some convoluted solution and explain it away with ""wibbly wobbly, timey wimey"" rather than an actual, well thought-out solution.)

Oh. Not much of a surprise."") 

Not to mention, characters have been thought to be dead (or actually have been dead) so often, that a *real* character death has lost it's emotional impact. This show is never going to have a ""leaf on the wind"" moment, thanks to Moffat.

true,dragontiers,null,null,"I'm sorry, but this is the first time I've ever been mad at the Doctor.  A part of me really hates him right now.  I know he's made tough choices before, and some of his incarnations (especially some of the earlier ones) were not always all that likable, but this...  I just don't know how to react to this.  It was such a mean, dirty trick.

It doesn't hurt because he lied.  He's lied plenty of times, especially in order to save those he cares about.  It isn't because he killed her (and let's face it, the whole ""He didn't kill her because she didn't exist""is wrong.  It's actually worse because he caused her to not exist.).  Again, he's killed in the past to save others.  It isn't because he used her.  He's often used unscrupulous people's greed and other baser emotions against them to save the day.

It's because of hope.  In the past, the Doctor has often been the savior of hope.  Appearing to those in need, those who had thought their position was hopeless and giving them the chance to fight back.  Even when he couldn't, he'd always been up front about it.  For example, in Pompeii, he flat out told Donna and the natives ""There's no way, I can't save them.  I'm sorry."" (He did anyways, but that's besides the point).  He always seemed brutally honest about it, telling people when he couldn't save them.  There have been plenty of episodes, and I'm thinking Tennent here, where he's used an innocent to save others when he couldn't save them, but he was always upfront about it.

Extending hope to someone who has been deprived of it for so long, telling them ""Yes, there is a chance.  We will try to save you too."", and then slamming the door in her face, I'm sorry, I don't know about that.  Old Amy wasn't an enemy to be tricked.  She wasn't some obstacle to move around.  She was a friend, a *companion*, in need of his help, and he told her he would try, then turned his back.  And honestly, if I was Rory, or even Amy once she was told, I think I would have been done at that point.  Let me off at the nearest convenient habitable world, don't bother sending me home, good-bye.

Because, let's face it, from Amy's perspective, he just abandoned her.  Yes it was old her, and it was to save young her, but either way, he used her and abandoned her.  And if I was her, I don't think I would be willing to wait for him to do it a second time to the 'real' her.  How could you trust the Doctor after that, after finding out he could do that to you? Even if it is for a more noble cause?  Because, with the Doctor, at some point it *will* be a choice between you and something bigger.  And while you knew that was a possibility before, you *knew* if he could, he'd find a way to save you.  And if he couldn't, he'd tell you and stay with you until the end.  Now...

Is this really going to affect me? Am I going to stop watching because of this?  Of course not.  But I sincerely hope this isn't a signal of darker things to come for the Doctor's personality.  Storyline, fine, I like a nice dark story with real risk now and again, but if his personality continues along this path, I shudder to think of what will happen.

My thoughts exactly. I have found myself thinking about the recent episodes more than enjoying them. This isn't because I enter into a viewing prepared to pick it apart, in fact I rather enjoyed ""Let's Kill Hitler"" when it started, but then it just got all turned around in my brain and I had to stop and think ""Wait a second...""

Maybe it's just me and how I watch things. I know I used to love The X-Files but something that always annoyed me was when they were trying to explain something and ""There are three possible reasons for this happening..."" but it's always the first thing they investigate. I had trouble enjoying the show because I started feeling stupid or inferior to the characters who always guessed right on the first try.

I guess my point is, I feel intelligence is being insulted this season. The argument ""Just stop thinking and enjoy it"" doesn't hold up.

Most people are saying that it requires more thinking and attention now with Moffat's stories. I can usually understand it fine first or maybe second time, but my friend just can't watch DW anymore.

My opinion is that they're not gimmicks. They're just Moffat's version of going through a plot and working through it. What I consider a gimmick is Stolen Earth/Journey's End. Donna becomes a genius and there happens to be a big blow-up button that controls all Daleks.

RTD's era was more about emotion, relationships, and feelings so I can see where you get the depth from. Moffat's very much about insane plots and adventure over touchy-feely ness.

But I know what you mean about stepping back from lack of entertainment- I felt that way with Night Terrors.

It's funny that you feel that way about X-Files (which I've never gotten into though I have lots of it). I feel that way about Sherlock figuring stuff out, but later realized the way the show is designed, you couldn't have possibly picked up all the clues because the screen doesn't show it or the plot doesn't tell us everything.

That's the kind of stuff I mean, some of it was opportunistic, some was just dumb luck/poor writing.

Please do not use the argument of  solving world hunger with GM food,  that is clearly nonsense.  And when you licence the right to produce food, then you are not in it to help anybody but yourself.


Anyway  when you have an special interest group that does not want to have food  clearly labelled as GM or not GM then you are not respecting consumers right to chood  (eg USA) and just based on that fact, - I would never support GM food.




And a lot of damage is done to the environment, and the food chain -  both directly and indirectly by GM crops.

But I'd rather just give you [this](http://globalcomment.com/2011/how-doctor-who-became-nurse-rory/) and remind you that this episode hinged on the premise that Amy only became independent because Rory failed to save her, and that once she was reminded that she could faint and he'd be there to carry her any sense of self (or self-preservation -- she definitely could have fought off those bots and lived another 36 years) went out the window and all she could do was talk about ""this boy"" she met on Earth. Yes, our relationships define us, but they don't completely overwhelm our individual identities. Everything in this episode that made Amy actually *Amy* -- including her most important thought ever -- revolved around Rory. That's an unrealistic portrayal of any romance and does the character a disservice.

Universities are generally catered for very well in this regard with their own doctor's surgeries.  You'll register with the surgery but you will find several doctors work there, and you can choose/request to see whichever doctor you wish.  Registering with the university doctors will be quick and easy, getting an appointment there won't be a problem either, but most doctors generally have open clinic times where if you don't have an appointment you can just turn up and wait to be seen. 

I'd definitely go down the University Medical Center route.  They'll tend to have more doctors available, so more choice, and they'll be accepting new patients.  I wouldn't worry about the registration for international students being towards the end of the month.  Find out where it is, go early, and just explain that you need a consultation now.  They're not  going to expect you to wait for 'international day' if you need their help now; I wouldn't worry about anything else if you can show you are, or you're going to be, one of their students.   Getting a pill prescription once you're registered won't take any time at all - most university medical centers will be able to get you an appointment to see a doctor virtually straight away.  They'll write you a prescription, you'll cross the road to the pharmacist, they'll give you pills.  You'll have your sperm defences charging by the end of the week! 

You can register wherever you want though, at any doctor's surgery if they're accepting patients.  That then will be your doctor's surgery/clinic (most surgeries and clinics have between at least 2 to 3 doctors working there) but you can attend any NHS hospital.

Have you ever looked at Madonna?  Women in their 50s who have the same general fitness level (or better) than when they were younger can start to look a bit freakish - the skin loses tone and fat, so the tendons and veins stick out noticeably, and the muscles have sharper definition as they're similarly unpadded.  Amy's arms were still thin and smooth.  I think the only way around this would have been to have her costume go right down to the wrist and hide her arms completely.

Also, redheads tend to lose their colour faster than others, so a 50+ redhead without access to a bottle of dye is a bit difficult to swallow.

And now suddenly the TARDIS has a personality and what comes perilously close to a ""soul,"" and the Doctor *accepts* this without concern or question.

Gaiman writes metaphysics and divinity. He writes metaphor and dream. I don't like Gaiman as a writer but even apart from that, he simply is not a good fit for Doctor Who, and I hope he *never* writes another episode for the show.

There is still a lot of information we don't have, but would you really be okay not looking for baby Melody after you saw Mels in LKH? I would think it was even more important to than before (when they trusted River completely) to find her now knowing what happened to her and change her upbringing. And I suspect the Doctor is thinking the same thing too. Though she has been vague, River alludes to the fact that the Doctor may be the man she killed. Whether this is actually true or not is irrelevant. If the Doctor believes it to have any possibility, it's in his best interest to find baby Melody too and change what happened.

It's not merely about getting to spend those years with her. It's about having a hand in how she was raised, protecting her from whatever happened to her between the time she was a baby and when she was Mels with Amy and Rory. As her parents, that should be their motivations. I think ethical morality is a huge theme with Eleven and I think a lot of the things we saw (Rory feeling like the Doctor was making him be like him, the Doctor lies, all that stuff) will become really important by the end of the season.

Edit: Despite the fact that River comes out okay in the end, this episode really dealt with this idea that just because something ends up okay, it doesn't mean it didn't happen.

true,arquebus_x,k9,K-9,"&gt; Ha..haha! Magic and animism have never had any place in Doctor Who? The TARDIS may have come perilously close to having a ""soul"" but a LOT of classic Who is all about people in robes chanting around some altar to summon their god who turns out to be the Daemons-Azal, the Planet of the Spiders, a raving computer-Underworld, a criminal controlling living Stone Henge stones...etc

But, as I said, those creatures are alien life forms that have at least a Who-consistent scientific rationale. There is no *true* magic, mysticism or divinity in classic Who. In new Who, that is changing, and Gaiman is a part of that change, and his episode was so far the most blatant form of it.

&gt; The TARDIS and the Doctor do have a big technobabble conversation about it, artron energy, matrix..etc. The brain is a sort of computer so if it can be deleted from the TARDIS matrix than it can be dumped into a human body.

All of this is true, but until Gaiman, the TARDIS never had a personality except metaphorically. And now the TARDIS has a consciousness as well (not just an AI consciousness, a living consciousness). Ick.

At least it appears, luckily, that the writers have taken a step back from Gaiman's episode.

Neither of these has exceeded six weeks, yet during the first period we were paid the wrong rate of JSA, which resulted in us living on Â£60 a week. When he pointed out the mistake he was told to re-apply for the correct benefit, but as he had a job we decided to leave it.

Then, four months later our car died which meant he was unable to get to work. He went and explained this to the Jobcentre, who assured him that it did not count as making himself unemployed. He found a new job within a month, but the last fortnight of JSA was not paid. We got a letter saying he had made himself unemployed and would not get benefit. I went to the Jobcentre in hysterics (two kids, no food) where I was told that it was an error, he had not made himself unemployed and we would get the money eventually. I refused to leave until it was sorted and they finally organised an immediate direct payment.

You cannot rely on the Jobcentre to get anything right, IMHO, the only way to get that to which you are entitled is harass them constantly and make notes and copies of every piece of correspondence and phone call. **Always get the name of the person you are talking to as well**, it's sometimes a life-saver. They get away with their errors because people don't have the energy to fight them. If they owe you money, make a fuss until you get it.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt;I'd love to get an IUD but my boyfriend thinks I might have to wait some time for that one. How does the NHS handle IUDs? Long waitlist?

I got my IUD at a 'walk-in' type of clinic because it was insanely difficult to get appointments with my GP. I am registered at a new GP now where I can walk in whenever I like. You will probably find it easiest to register with the university doctor but as far as I know you can register with who ever will have you.

I don't know of any reason you'd have to wait a while for your IUD, it was really quick for me. They usually see you and discuss it, might run some STD tests, then book you in a few weeks later to actually have it done. So look about your local area and see what health services are available.

 If there is a Contraceptive and Sexual health clinic that will do IUDs you're likely to get a more experienced doctor (at doing them) and just have an easier time of it in general. Although only trained doctors should ever do them, I still think it's better to get one who does them more often if you can since there is some skill involved. I think those clinics are also more focused and efficient for that sort of thing than a general practice clinic.

You usually don't turn up at hospitals unless it's an emergency or pre arranged - for less urgent things you have your local GP, clinics like the one I mentioned and NHS direct.

And that's pretty much what we got.

I could have lived with that, though, if the writing hadn't turned so plodding and unrealistic.

The third season practically ground to a halt after the incredible rescue from New Caprica, because someone thought it would be a good idea to remove the main threat from the show.

Not to mention the ridiculous Final Five plot, which stemmed - and I remember hearing it in an interview - from the writing staff **forgetting** that there were supposed to be 12 regular models of cylon when they wrote new Caprica. So to explain why we only see the Regular 7, they made the final five all mystical, and not-really-cylon. It was beyond stupid.

It picked up a little in the fourth season, with the mutiny in the fleet, but we also had stinkers like how Six's broken heart caused her baby to self-abort, or how the repercussions of the mutiny were pretty minimal. 

But the poor writing culminated in the finale where the denizens of the fleet elect, of their own free will, on the whim of Lee Adama, to become cave-men, and chuck all their tech into the sun!

true,[deleted],null,null,"I judge it to be more about controlling the narrative, or even just control.  Think about it, the major story during the phone 'hacking' scandal was the phone hacking scandal, yet of course, the Murdoch empire didn't touch it, and only *The Guardian* initially went after the details with any intent. The same for the revival of the likely Iraqi civilian executions from 2006; that would definitely sell, as would stories about unmanned drones taking out the wrong targets which is a weekly occurrence. It reminds me of the quote about incompetence and malice. Never ascribe to collusion that which is adequately explained by market forces.

Another way to see it would be a form of censorship, the headlines about a meta-event detract from any new legitimate story that might be happening; maybe NHS cuts, or tax cuts for the rich.

Personally I see it as completely political tool of surpression. It really does remind me of events like *The Holocaust* rather than the Jewish holocaust, and even Christ himself. Both have the pattern of uniting a society through a traumatic event that paints the protagonist as a righteous victim, against a common enemy. From there you can justify any arbitrary logical construct (law) or action. Continuing the theme, all the major religions liked to immortalise traumatic events with specific days. Christianity applied a form of cultural genocide over the pagan societies it expanded over, in part by hijacking the calendar and painting itself as the victim. 9/11 in that regard is no different.

The same goes with the US today going out of its way to be portrayed as the victim. Even faced with a video of US soldiers murdering civilians, they immediately pushed the idea of a threat to national security and Wikileaks 'having blood on their hands'. As do the police today, every story of police/protester/civilian conflict opens with the body count for the police and then the number of arrested.

true,shanem,null,null,"Yes there are exceptional situations where it's more ""OK"".  The primary being in a country where it isn't available broadcast or online.  Situations of no money.

The intermediary is where one doesn't have enough money.  Now just for discussion purposes you have to consider that most all people who have the means of torrenting Doctor Who have some amount of discretionary spending.  So now you enter a case where they are instead spending their money on something they can't pirate and not on something like Doctor Who because they can.  So this disrupts the financial pressure on a person when they have to start deciding where to put their money, and in these cases piratable things lose out.  So for instance buying beer or soda instead of paying for Doctor Who on Amazon/iTunes.  Or canceling cable so you can afford paying for the specific show you like ( BBCA is extra in my area for instance )

Now yes there is of course the secondary effects of piracy that you mention, the problem I see here though is that in these situations you can't condone the behavior in others because you don't know that they are doing the same.  (Just over the weekend I had two people I know admit they pirate shows because it's easy even though they can afford paying for it online)  So you effectively have to be a lurker and NOT post/upvote torrent posts on reddit etc in these cases.  You have to be able to make the objective decision for yourself but you can't assume others are too.

Now you might argue that it doesn't matter because caitiecat is just one person and BBC will never miss the money she would have generated for them.   But this is the Tragedy of the Commons or Fallacy of the Masses.  Which basically says ""well what if everyone thought that too?""  In this case Doctor Who would have no non UK funding.

And, yeah, End of Time was less impactful because you knew he would simply regenerate. Well, technically speaking, we always know The Doctor will pull through(As the series is in no way close to ending), but it limits your ability to suspend belief.

And I don't see how it 'ruins the point of regeneration'. What do you seem to think the point of it is? As far as story, it's meant as a way for Time Lords to heal themselves, not necessarily cheat death. Even if it was, that doesn't mean that regeneration is perfect.

*""They're saying that the President's got this grand plan. He's going to save the world with some big financial scheme.""*

Even if it weren't ridiculous and vague on the surface, it's just a poor sounding piece of dialogue.  

It sounded like RTD was lampooning Brits who thought that Obama would be some sort of cross-Atlantic messiah, at least I hope that's the angle and that he wasn't that ridiculously silly himself, but it just read poorly.
It was kind of a ridiculous idea, and it was so out there they couldn't even get specific enough with it apart to say ""**some** big financial scheme"". 

At least the U.S. president from Season 3 functioned as a sort of caricature instead of an actual person. 

Of course, someone pointed out that the episode referred to President Winters as ""president-elect"", and that this would mean he doesn't actually hold any presidential office yet, nor was it the proper time of the year for a president-elect.

Moffat is sacrificing canon for his own pretty little storylines (don't get me started on how much I hate River). He is essentially trying to make his own TV show and tries very hard to forget that the universe already has laws that were created before him, and that he has to work within those laws, not abandon them in lieu of whatever laws he favors for his stories.


TL;DR: Good story, but I hate Moffat for sacrificing logic for them.

Personally, I feel as though the police presence should have been a little less, and then the EDL folk could do what the hell they like. Police should come in when a crime is actually committed. This way, there is still freedom of speech, but the speech does not go without direct condemnation by peers in society. In other words, we should let this stuff happen naturally.

true,MidasTouch,english,Brighton,"His name is Lake Palmer. I'm not sure where this text originates but I got it from his My Space page.

LAKE'S STORY: ""People will think I'm a silly old man but I was lonely"" The 60-year-old admits he was taken for a fool by an Asian beauty he married only three days after they met. She strung him along for eight months before dumping him for another rich European man, leaving him Â£12,000 in debt. Now Lake spends his days in bed, suffering from depression. A former Army captain who served in the Borders, he watches Coronation Street with a growing sense of fear and dread for a character he has come to empathise with. 'The plotline has brought it all back to me,' he said. 'I don't know if they will manage to fool poor old Fred but it certainly looks like it. 'I want to shout at the TV and tell him to use his head not his heart. 'I know he's only a soap character but what's happening to him just now is really affecting me.' Lake married Panom Yeesoon nicknamed Jad in a Buddhist ceremony in Thailand four years ago. He was convinced he had found a woman who would love and care for him for the rest of his life. When he returned home, he bombarded her with gifts, money and love letters. But eight months later, after failing to get a visa to come to Britain, she dumped him for someone else. Lake said: 'I know people will say I'm a silly old man but I am very lonely. Growing old on your own is frightening. 'I was just looking for someone who would give me companionship in my twilight years a bit like Fred.' A former offshore gas rig worker, Lake was forced to retire in 2000 due to ill health. He had been married twice before but neither relationship had lasted more than five years. He decided to seek a Thai bride through an introduction agency. It cost him Â£1385 and a further Â£800 to get to Bangkok, where he met Jad. She was 45 but looked much younger. 'She had a regal quality,' he said. 'She was slim and very well-dressed. I was swept off my feet.' On their second day together, he proposed. They married the following day in a hastily-arranged Buddhist ceremony. Luckily for him, Lake had forgotten his decree absolute and couldn't get the paperwork together for a legally-binding ceremony. So, what he went through was only a blessing. He slept with Jad on their wedding night and spent five more romantic days with her, before taking his pre-booked flight home. She pledged to follow him as soon as her visa came through. It was August 2000 and Lake thought they'd be together by Christmas. From his home in Great Yarmouth, he ran up a telephone bill of Â£1800 and sent her Â£1500 and lavish gifts. But she was refused a visa. It turned out she was still legally married to another Englishman. Ever hopeful, Lake continued to correspond and send money until April 2001, when she told him in a telephone call she had met a Belgian man and didn't want to know him any more. He said: 'I cried for six weeks and I've lost all my confidence. I only have my Army pension to live on. I think that's why she didn't want me. 'I've had a nervous breakdown and I'm still desperately lonely.' ",0,1315777581,null,0,false,0,c2j4v45,t3_kc9gn,t1_c2j4v45,t3_kc9gn,1427587353,5,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,5

I found it more cruel that he didn't want to acknowledge the Amy that was left outside as her own entity with her own fears and desires, but more as an unpleasant mistake to be corrected. He practically stuck his fingers in his ears and went ""LA LA LA, SHE'S NOT REAL"" when she started pleading with them from outside.

You saying it was like an execution was funny too. I noticed it first with Tennant and then it seems to be a recurring theme more and more often now that the Doctor will set up the entire execution, but never seems to be willing to pull the trigger himself. I think Davros even called him on it shortly before he blew up. He did it again with this episode. When Rory starts calling him out on this, he forces Rory's hand on the trigger and steps away. I guess you could argue it wasn't the Doctor's choice to make. I think he was just trying to evade responsibility.

I was hoping AVB was going to pull a similar move to when he removed Kalou during that game the past week and replace Anelka for Torres. It will be interesting to see him play alongside Mata and Sturridge with Meireles being the play maker. The thought of Essien's return makes me drool at the thought of their combined play. Torres has been lackluster for a while, but he was brought into a system that does not suit his style of play, and really he hasn't been put into it with the proper players. For the past year or so, Chelsea's lack of depth on the wings and lackluster playmaking have plagued their play and goal scoring tally. They now have this depth with younger, more agile and quicker passing players. Unfortunately Torres hasn't been able to experience this side of the team in league play, when he was subbed on he played with the old guard.

Well, let me play devil's advocate for a moment. I can't say I'm 100% sure either way, this being an impossible, fictional scenario, but I can see how one might give some credence to that argument (that it's not as bad as killing her).

Theoretically, every decision anyone makes ""kills"" an entire universe of potential. Everyone that ever might have been a certain way because of an action you take ceases to exist (and in a wibbly wobbly timey wimey sense, you might even imagine they *do* cease to exist; their timeline ceases to be a possibility) when you decide not to do something. Or to do something. We work out a universe of possibilities into a single stream of causes and results and a singular terminal state, eliminating the alternate possible versions of reality which, in Doctor Who, may actually ""be"".

So in this sense, the only difference between ""killing"" old-Amy, and changing time any of the other hundreds of times they already have is the intimacy of the subject being altered as well as the fact that the ""potential timeline"" was actually observed in considerable detail.

So, really, conventional ethics fall a bit flat in this kind of discussion. How do you place value on a life like that? You're trading off two possible ways for her to live; saved by Rory or trapped for 36 years. No one dies, but a decision is made and a potential universe (or at least one person's potential part in such a universe) dies.",0,1315781395,null,0,false,0,c2j5ar3,t3_kay2s,t1_c2j5ar3,t1_c2j03xb,1427587550,8,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,8

true,[deleted],null,null,"Another redditor had a good theory on fixed points. When Rasillion, Omega, and ""the other"" (who may just be The Doctor himself) gained power, they took control of an otherwise chaotic time stream and spun out the [web of time](http://tardis.wikia.com/wiki/Web_of_time). In this web, they made ""fixed points"" the most benefited the Time Lords, Humans (and I think one other race was mentioned). They essentially took control of time and kept these points ""fixed"" to the best of their abilities. If the fixed points were changed, the web would unravel.

The Time Lords monitored and maintained these fixed points with the assistance of the Matrix. Other species (such as the Daleks) that gained time travel would threaten these fixed points, but the Time Lords would take [corrective measures](http://tardis.wikia.com/wiki/Temporal_paradox).  A Time Lord is imprinted with ability to navigate this web of time and know when a fixed point was. 

Now, after the Time War, the only Time Lord left is The Doctor and he's having a tough time keeping the fixed points fixed. Time itself is starting to unravel and temporal paradoxes are becoming more common. At some point, this is going to catch up with him and the Time Lords are going to have to return (or another race is going to have to step in and take care of Time).

There is some speculation on this. The Ood have gone by the wayside, but it was obvious that some agency was advancing The Ood as a species - and they could reach across time without a Tardis or temporal manipulator. There was some speculation that The Ood was being setup to become the new Time Lords. Then we have The Silence. They have now turned out to be a religious order, but the aliens we have seen are very interested in siezing control of time.

You have The Ood - a fairly benevolent species that can reach across time using the power of their mind, you have The Silence building Tardises that they (so far) can't pilot, and we have various Human groups (Time Agency, the Justice Department, etc). Of course, you also have The Doctor, and the old Time Lords trapped in The Moment. At some point, we're going to see some sort of battle between these groups (unless the Ood have been discarded) for control of Time itself.

In fact, that might be what we are seeing this series.

She's fiercely independent and on the one hand she wants to see herself one way, but on the other hand, she's really the person she's fighting. Even the resolution of this episode shows how she's finally coming to terms with it, I think.

2. Male.


3. Of the 4 I have witnessed (McGann to Smith) I'd say Smith (more to do with writing than performance giving him an edge as Tennant was marvelous).


4. Martha Jones because she was the hottest AND the most capable.


5. Impossible to answer, really depends on my mood. I mean there's Girl in the Fireplace, Human Nature/Family of Blood, Blink, Amy's Choice, The Lodger, Pandorica Opens/Big Bang, The Doctor's Wife... Generally I like stand-alone stories but finales almost always satisfy me more than most people.

It's something different if their personality is changed so much that they are more like relatives than the same person.  I think at that point, you are deciding between two different people.

He gave Old Amy hope so she would help bring Young Amy forward, and then dropped her.  As Ochobobo pointed out, the Doctor doesn't like that being done to him:

&gt;You gave me hope and then you took it away. That's enough to make any man angry. GOD KNOWS what it will do to me! Basically... RUN!

It may have been necessary, and in the end it may have been the right choice, but the manner he made that choice bodes dark things for the Doctor.",0,1315790653,null,0,false,0,c2j6dmu,t3_kay2s,t1_c2j6dmu,t1_c2j5ar3,1427588063,3,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,3

All of this was done on purpose by the writers, so that we would know that there's something important about the shoes.

I don't think that it makes the storyline sexist or diminishes Amy in any way--think of the strong women Moffat's worked with and created throughout his Doctor Who tenure, Martha Jones, for example. 

I think that it's a science-fictionalized version of a real struggle a lot of women have between becoming this idea of a mother and becoming this idea of who they think they want to be, believing them to be mutually exclusive, and I actually think it takes insight for a man to get that conflict.

The bit about the Valeyard is a bit more interesting. Season 23 was called ""Trial of a Timelord"" and featured the Sixth Doctor being put on trial by the Time Lords for genocide and tampering with the time stream.

It later emerges that the Valeyard is in fact the 12th incarnation of the Doctor, and has falsified the evidence to guarantee a guilty verdict. They end up fighting in the Matrix of Galifrey, where the Master ends up helping the Doctor defeat the Valeyard - however at the very end we discover the Valeyard has survived and taken over the position of Keeper of the Matrix.

One of the notable things about this is the moment of the Doctor's realization that Time Lord society has become decadent and corrupt , a position that would help him rationalise locking them away during the Time War. In which case avoiding this future might in fact cause major issues with the time stream.

First, it is different in motive.  Older Amy only exists *because* of them.  If they had landed when they intended, she wouldn't have existed in the first place.  Because they didn't, even though it was unintentional, they caused her to exist.  In this manner, it is different because they are responsible for her, she is a result of their action (or inaction, however you choose to look at it).

Secondly, it is different in opportunity.  I believe it can be best illustrated by an analogy.  Say you are in a burning building.  You run down the stairs and out the door without encountering anyone.  Later you found out people died in that fire. Are you responsible?  No.  But let's say on your way down the stairs you find someone passed out on the landing.  You leave them there and exit the building.  Later you find out they died in the fire.  Now are you responsible?  To a certain extent, yes.  

Of course, there are always mitigating factors.  Maybe you didn't save them because you were carrying someone else out and couldn't carry them both.  Maybe you were so overcome with smoke inhalation all you could do was crawl out yourself and pass out on the lawn.  Maybe you tried all you could to save them, but they were trapped under a beam and you couldn't free them.  These are all legitimate reasons why you may no longer be responsible for their fate.  But the way I see it, in this case, the Doctor isn't just someone escaping a burning building, he's a Firefighter.  He goes in, finds someone, starts carrying them out, and stumbles across a second person.  He tells them he will be back for them, or sends someone else after them.  Instead, he leaves the building with the first person, and never goes back in, fearing the building may collapse on him.  

Is he right? Was it too dangerous for him to even try?  I can't say, only the Doctor knows for sure. But I think he feels the guilt either way, and maybe he could have saved her.

Or maybe I'm stretching the analogy too far.",0,1315797401,null,0,false,0,c2j79i6,t3_kay2s,t1_c2j79i6,t1_c2j6rhf,1427588476,3,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,3

true,Salva_Veritate,eccleston,Eccleston,"""Series"" in British is ""Season"" in America. They're all the same series in American terminology, though the show kind of has two versions: old (1963 to 1989) and new (2005-present). They're the same series but the style is wildly different between the old one and the new one, and the version getting hyped up now is the new one.

Now, the story is sort of in a sequential format so I'd start with the beginning of the 2005 version with the 9th Doctor. The first episode is called ""Rose"", and just go forward from there. 

I'd recommend giving the old version a shot too. I've only recently started watching the old version, so I can't say for certain what episode to give you as a starting point, but most people say just pick a few episodes in the Tom Baker (4th Doctor) era. The old version was a lot less sequential, with a few exceptions, so don't worry about picking up in the middle of a storyline.

true,LokianEule,mccoy,Time's Champion,"Salva Veritate is right. The show was created in 1963 and had an indefinite hiatus in 1989. Then a brief back-door pilot aired in Britain and America in 1996 called the Enemy Within/Doctor Who movie, which kind of failed. Most people think it's bad. And then the show rebooted in 2005 with the same story originally held in the classic series but very stand alone. You don't need to see the old stuff.

So start with the 2005, if it seems a little dodgy to you keep going and don't stop. Not until you hit series 5.

Also forgot to say this. Doctor Who is a British sci-fi tv series about a 900+ year old alien called the Doctor, who travels through space and time in a blue police box that's bigger on the inside called the TARDIS (time and relative dimensions in space). Got that? Good.

He travels around having adventures and such and usually has one to three human (or not) companions. The Doctor is a Time Lord and Gallifreyan from the planet Gallifrey. As a Gallifreyan, the Doctor has two hearts and when dying will regenerate his body. Meaning every atom will change and he'll get a new body, and slightly different personality (but still him- we love to discuss which Doctor is our favorite though). In real life it means some actor will take his place. We're on number 11 now (not to mention some other uncounted Doctors...). 

NuWho is all about standalone episodes, the occasional 2-parter and only one 3-parter in the reboot. The show has a loose overaching plot throughout the season that is usually concluded at the finale. However since 2010 when the 11th Doctor and new writer Steven Moffat took charge, the overaching plot is much more in depth.

Here's a funny parody video to show what probably (didn't) happen when they decided to make Doctor Who. But it is somewhat true. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPodPoVO1b4&amp;feature=related

true,MtHammer,smith,Smith,"I would definitely start post 2005 ""reboot.""  Specifically, I'd start at the beginning of a new Doctor, which means starting in one of 3 places:

1. Season (Series) 1: Christopher Eccleston's reign.  This is probably the most logical starting point since it also served as the ""reboot"" point for the show.  Eccleston is great but be warned - some of the early episodes are kind of terrible.  The first time I tried getting into Doctor Who, I got about 4 episodes in before I finally hit an episode so bad that I quit watching.  After a few months I was convinced to give it another try and I'm really glad I did because it picks up quite a bit by the end of the first season and I ended up getting hooked pretty quickly after that.  Basically - the first season is a very good starting point, but you have to be in for the long haul because it takes a little while to really get good.

2. Season (Series) 2: The beginning of the Tennant years.  David Tennant is the favorite Doctor of *a lot* of people, and not without reason - he plays the character with a lot of charisma and personality.  It's probably a little easier to get into Tennant's first episodes than Eccleston's as a result, but the drawback is that you'll miss out on a good chunk of the crucial bits of back-story that they provided in season 1.  You'll probably eventually glean most of them anyway, but it will take a while.

3. Season (Series) 5. The beginning of the modern era.  Season 5 ushered in a new show-runner in Steven Moffat, a new Doctor in Matt Smith, a new version of the theme song/credits, and a new push to boost the show's popularity in America.  Because of that, the show is actually pretty diligent about trying to fill in new viewers on the Doctor's relevant back-story. To be completely honest, this has been my favorite period of modern Doctor Who and Matt Smith is probably my favorite Doctor.  But, if you started here you'd be missing out (at least initially) on *a ton* of fantastic Eccleston and Tennant episodes.

Personally, I'd start with season 1 and Christopher Eccleston.  The writing is pretty rough at first and the production values aren't quite there yet (they get *much* better as the show goes on), but the payoff is very worth it.  If you do try season 1 but end up hating it, though, you should be aware that seasons 2 and 5 are both valid jumping off points as well, and one of them may be more your cup of tea.

EDIT:  You might also want to try watching one or two of the better stand-alone episodes first - just to give you a feel for the show as a whole.  Personally, I've found the absolutely fantastic season 3 episode *Blink*, followed by season 2's *The Girl in the Fireplace* to be an excellent 1-2 punch when it comes to introducing people to Doctor Who.

Let me put it this way - I think the Doctor would rather die than spend the rest of time in such a safe, predictable, downright suburban simulation, and we now know River to be very much cut from the same cloth.

Her fate was fine when we didn't really know much about the character, but now that we do it just seems wrong to me.

&gt; You realise that advertising is the way the shows on the other channels are paid for?

Of course.  The raison d'etre for TV channels (except the BBC, HBO and a couple of other subscription-based, advert-free channels) is to sell advertising.  The television programs are entirely secondary to that purpose.

&gt; Its not a bad trade really.

I guess that depends on how desperate you are to watch television. I wouldn't read a book that had adverts in it.  Nor would I go to the cinema to watch a film if they interrupted the main feature with adverts.  Why should I tolerate that kind of annoyance for TV?

Or maybe you mean the uphill battle to get his message across in the Ganger episodes.

But really I've always thought of Doctor Who as sci-fi fantasy. There's a lot of pseudo science, but as a friend said to me once,

""I always assumed that the laws of physics worked differently in the Doctor Who universe.""

Also I think the Doctor uses these so called distractions and fast talking to 1) keep it interesting 2) explain the science 3) put in hints for a later time like in Time of Angels/Flesh and Stone when the Doctor mentions the Aplans and their two heads or how the Doctor talks about the Corsair. so he's a bit like the 2nd Doctor in that he acts like a silly guy but really he's pretty 7-manipulative.",0,1315805919,null,0,false,0,c2j8am5,t3_kcs4o,t1_c2j8am5,t3_kcs4o,1427588961,5,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,5

Adam had his worst game in a Liverpool shirt and Lucas seemed a bit off pace today. Enrique wasn't looking quite as sharp either and Skrtel really never gave us much support going forward.

I think there were definitely some positives from the game though. Bellamy looks a good addition, to bring on at exactly those moments. I thought we were sharper when he came on for Hendo. Speaking of Hendo, he didn't have as bad a game as everyone seems to be thinking. Yeah, he missed a sitter, but he was in that position to receive the ball in the first place. And while we're on the topic of positioning, what in the world is Andy Carroll doing out there? There were multiple occasions late in the game when we got the ball out wide near the byline and Andy is standing 3-4 meters outside the box.

Do we send back people who were born here?
Do we send back people who came here because their country is ravaged by famine,knowing they will most likely die?
Do we send people back to countries ravaged by war, perhaps even wars we are part of?
Do we send people back if we know they will be killed if they return to their home country?
Do we send back the Sikh and Muslim doctors who work for the NHS saving peoples lives?
Do we send Polish people back?

Its not as simple as ""send them all back""

The arrest and incarceration of Bradley Manning.

""Governments do not have the authority to say what marriage is or to change its nature or to decree that people of the same sex can marry.""

Er... Are there no laws pertaining to marriage in this and other countries set by government? Is there not a certain (almost secular) component known as ""Signing the register"" that has to be completed in any marriage - is that a religious observence?

To directly contradict the Bish, governments *can* decide because they are democratically elected by the people. Oh hang on, is he thinking ""marriage"" is given from above by his god? Trouble is marriage has been around longer than his god and when it comes to a good many marriages performed in this country, there's no religious element.

&gt; He said dismissing objections because they came from a religious body was ""tantamount to an incitement to religious intolerance"".

Time to drag out the relevant rebuttal: In the bible there are passages concerning marriage within your 'tribe' that could be interpreted to mean that black people should only marry black people, and white people should only marry white people etc.

Find a minister who doesn't like inter-racial marriage. Make him perform inter-racial marriage. He objects. Throw the book at him for racism? No hang on! You can't *make* him do it! It's religious intolerance!

&gt; A government which favours and allows for same-sex marriage does wrong.

How?

&gt; It fails in its duty to society. 

How?

&gt; It undermines the common good. 

What's the common good here? It is the 'common good' for people to force others to be miserable, to be 2nd class citizens, to not have the same rights afforded to others in the same situation?

&gt; It commits an act of cultural vandalism.

How?

&gt; Such a government does not deserve the trust which the nation, and including many in the Catholic community, has shown in it.

Someone needs to remind him that he is speaking from a position of authority in the *Catholic Chruch*. Why are these homophobes even being given the airtime? (ponders he, talking about it at length).

&gt; Bishop Tartaglia said the Catholic Church would never register civil partnerships nor celebrate same-sex marriage.

What fun. That means it'll lose even more members and integrity.

&gt; Scottish Liberal Democrat leader Willie Rennie said more than six in 10 people supported same-sex marriage.

Well damn, that would mean that the majority of people don't think it'll screw up the ""common good"".

To ask the question I asked that homophobe last week when [he posted this](http://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/k5jb6/on_the_scottish_governments_consultation_on_gay/):

**What do you think will happen if gays are allowed to marry? What terrible events will occur that lead to society crumbling?**

They do not seem to be capitalising on the fact that I think there is a very large market out there to be taken advantage of, for a bank that will offer retail banking services to the general population where your deposits are safe because they are not tied to high-risk banking practices.

Why are these building societies not pushing this angle?

Perhaps the big boys in the banking sector could crush them if they were to upset the status-quo? Even banks that partake in retail only operations still need to rely on intra-bank lending I imagine. Is this what prevents building societies from stealing customers from the big banks?

The bail outs were justified by saying that banks are the lifeblood of our economy. But that's only really retail banking that is the life-blood isn't it, e.g. small loans and current accounts? Or do we as an economy need to bail out the stock market and investment banking operations for jobs and liquidity to remain in the country?

If the big banks collapsed, what would be the downside to the man in the street? Aside from loss of deposits, which would be solved by banking with B.Socs.

true,abw,cnty-uk,Surrey,"True, you get adverts *before* a film (which you can easily avoid by turning up 20 minutes after the advertised start time), but you don't get them interrupting you in the middle of the film.  Same with DVD - you can skip the adverts at the start (and fuck the DVD producer if you can't) and just watch the film without being interrupted every 20 minutes to be sold something.  

When I've paid to watch a film, either on DVD or in the cinema, I expect to be able to watch it without further adverts *during* the film.  I am the customer and the film is the product that I have paid for.  In general, that is, and most probably will remain the case for the foreseeable future.  That's because the film industry generates the bulk of it's revenue from selling content and not from advertising.  In other words, it's not the adverts that are paying for the film to be made.  They're a nice little sideline for the cinema, distribution company, etc., and of course they help to promote future films to increase sales, but they're not the main feature, if you'll pardon the pun.

On the other hand, commercial TV and magazines *are* funded almost entirely by adverts.  They exists as vehicles to sell advertising space (the cover price of a magazine often doesn't cover the cost of printing, distribution and retailer profit, let alone the cost of production).  Here the advertisers are the customer and the viewers/readers are the product that the media company is selling.  

&gt; But you've missed the point.

No, I haven't missed the point at all.  I understand completely well how commercial TV and magazines works and I'm not suggesting that they're wrong or should be changed.  The business model clearly works (although in decline) and if you, as a ""consumer"", are happy paying the price of being constantly interrupted by adverts then that's great.  

Clearly there are lots of people who are, and I'm happy for them.  I don't begrudge them their pleasure one little bit. It's just that I'm not one of them.  Which is why I prefer to avoid commercial TV, whenever possible (not always) and rarely buy magazines.

http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/revealed-how-cameron-is-related-to-the-queen-518176.html





The plummy-voiced son of an Oxfordshire stockbroker is the great-great-great-great-great grandson of King William IV and thus a distant relative of the Queen.

The noble lineage of Michael Howard's expected replacement also comes with a faint whiff of early 19th-century scandal - Mr Cameron's blue blood stems from the king's affair with a leading actress via one of their 10 illegitimate children.

The evidence that establishes a bloodline between the Queen and her would-be Tory prime minister has been uncovered by Debrett's Peerage and Baronetage, the genealogical bible of the upper crust.

Charles Mosley, the editor-in-chief of Debrett's, said: ""It will at least make it easier for Mr Cameron to break the ice if and when he meets the present sovereign as her prime minister.

""I don't know what it says about a meritocratic Britain. There is no doubting that David Cameron got off to a privileged start but it is part of the haphazard tapestry of life that he finds himself as a fairly close relative to the monarch.""

The Oxford-educated Tory politician is fifth cousin twice removed of the Queen, according to the genealogists.

The link has its roots in the relationship - an open secret in the royal court - between William IV, the last member of the German House of Hanover to rule Britain, and Dorothy Jordan, a leading actress in late 18th-century and early 19th-century London. One of their children, Elizabeth, born in 1801, is the forebear of Cameron.

Despite being illegitimate, the children of Mrs Jordan (who was unmarried but used the honorific ""Mrs"" to give her more respectability on the stage) were officially recognised by their father and given the name FitzClarence.

William IV's wife, Princess Adelaide of Saxe-Meiningen, bore him no surviving heirs so the crown passed to his 18-year-old niece, who became Queen Victoria, the present Queen's great-great-grandmother.

A bewildering assortment of marriages between landed gentry and assorted aristocrats, including the 18th Earl of Erroll and the 5th Earl of Fife, places Mr Cameron - who recently displayed his populist credentials by urging listeners of a London community radio station to ""keep it real"" - firmly in the lineage of those born to rule by birth.

Mr Mosley said: ""If William IV had been allowed to marry Dorothy Jordan, then David Cameron would be more closely related to the monarch than he is to the present Queen.""

All of which caused mild consternation in the Cameron camp as the Conservatives prepare to unveil their new leader, supposedly the standard bearer of a modern, merit-based Britain.

A Cameron aide said: ""I know for a fact that Mr Cameron is blissfully unaware of this. Journalists seem to know far more about his family history than he does.

""He hasn't looked into his background, but he's said as a passing joke that he's going to. I can't confirm or deny it.""

If he chooses, the would-be Tory leader can point to his great-great-great-great-great-grandfather as a moderniser of sorts.

William IV, who spent most of his career in the Royal Navy and had not expected to succeed to the throne in 1830, helped to ensure that the 1832 Reform Act - which extended the franchise and abolished rotten boroughs - was passed. During his seven-year reign, the poor law was reformed and slavery abolished.

But Cameron cannot go too far in touting his ancestor's democratic credentials. William IV was also the last British monarch to appoint a prime minister against the will of Parliament.",0,1315833518,null,0,false,0,c2ja0n7,t3_kd0et,t1_c2ja0n7,t3_kd0et,1427589779,-1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,-1

I would say it isn't remotely the same, for one thing you, mostly, buy oil that is quite tightly regulated, (those regulations might not be enforced). I'm not a spokesperson for the oil companies, they are mostly shit, but you can get oil from off the coast of Scotland; I know Aberdeen isn't the greatest of places but I'd hardly call it a crime against humanity.

Also when you talk about oil, though, you're not talking about some lavish party drug; you're talking about the entire worlds dependence on fossil fuels which is a completely separate debate. 

&gt;The problems in South America have more to do with the numerous failed states and civil wars then the drugs trade. If cocaine suddenly stopped making you high do you think Mexico would turn into Nirvana.

I don't disagree that drugs aren't the only problem but they are how the cartels get funded. If you take away their money/business you at least have a fighting chance of stopping their behavior. Its almost exactly the same principle as not buying blood diamonds. 

For the record, I am anti-prohibition (and pro-regulation) of recreational drugs. I just think that people should care where they come from the same way we have populist movements against blood diamonds, the fur trade, battery farm chickens, nestle selling formula milk etc etc. As the world stands, by buying cocaine you're funding murder, and not murder of animals, murder of people in horrific and inhumane ways.

true,ChrisHansensVoice,english,The Geordie Schooner,"the most popular one is the Travelling Sales Person problem. It's basically the issue of finding the best path between point A and point B if both points can be reached through more than one route (each path can traverse several interconnected ""nodes""). Computers can ""brute force"" solve the problem by just trying every possible sequence and comparing the amount of time between the start and end point, which is fine if you're solving a short route with only 5 or 6 nodes, but if you're - for example - working out how the internet should transmit data across the world that's a lot of data. 

The way that humans are generally better at solving these problems is that we're creatures of habit. Think about when you move into a new house and you need to walk to work. The first day it will take you 25 minutes to get there, but you notice a short-cut the next day and it takes 23 minutes. Eventually you can get your travelling time down to 19 minutes in 7 iterations of the journey. Humans are evolutionarily predispositioned to these kinds of linear improvement problems (day 3's route took an extra minute, ignore that route from now on, and return to day two's route and attempt a new improvement) whereas computers are better at genetic algorithms where it will look at two potential routes, and try to mix them, see if that's a better result, and then take the two best results form that test, and mix them, attempt to get a new better result, and continue to do that 'till you have X amount of iterations without improvement - which can often lead to hundreds of iterations of wasted computer cycles. 

The difference is that humans can tell much faster when they have reached the acceptably-good route, whereas computers will attempt over and over again to solve the problem more efficiently, and often just brute forcing it would have been a better solution.

Computers are now at the stage where they can solve most mathematical problems much better than humans - because if it can't do it, it's normally because it just doesn't have enough processors so you just add more processors - but they are generally worse at random chance and observational puzzles.",0,1315839405,null,0,false,0,c2jalwq,t3_kcy94,t1_c2jalwq,t1_c2jah9o,1427590128,7,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,7

So, here's some of the examples...

Jonny Vegas - Manchester. This is a Northern accent but distinct in that Mancunian accents tend to be quite nasal and 'ers' at the end of words tend to become 'ors'. Stick your head in a freezor, sound like your from Manchestor. 

Ross Noble - Newcastle. Very distinctive accent that has loads of it's own vocab. Call centre's are often based in Newcastle as the accent is percieved to be down to earth and trustworthy.

Jimmy Carr - Recieved Pronounciation (or the Queen's English). This is the English that everyone knows from the BBC. In reality, not a lot of people talk like this but it's what we're known for.

Sean Lock - Is quite cockney. This is a London/South Eastern accent and as close to 'chim chiminy cim chim cheroo as you can get.

Bill Bailey - Has a largely southern accent but with shades of the Westcountry about it. Down there they tend to drag out vowel sounds so things like 'grass' become 'graaaass'. It's quite a soft accent and often used to portray bumpkins.

Amy threw together a sonic screwdriver?  Come on.  Rory, I would buy that from - he helps the doctor perform maintenance on the TARDIS, he's read up on all the latest scientific (earth) theories, and knows how to use a sonic almost as well as the doctor.  But to Amy, the sonic is a magic wand, and I can't believe she'd have the knowledge to throw one together from spare parts.  If asked to describe how it works, I feel pretty certain that she'd say it's spacey-wacey.  Now, maybe the idea is that we're (as viewers) SUPPOSED to under-estimate her, and there's a lot more going on than we're aware of, but have a hard time buying it.

The slo-mo fight scene - terrible.  Destroys a robot by smashing a painting over it's head?  And Amy's fighting style was...  well... I had a hard time not laughing.  She wielded that sword in a way that made me more concerned that she's hack off one of her own limbs than that she's stop a robot.  Give me some credit as a viewer.  The whole fight scene pulled me right out of the story.

His Empty Child/The Doctor Dances episodes, and The Christmas Story episodes stand out for truly going into more depth, for which I am glad.  But most of his others stuff doesn't really challenge us morally, at least not to any exceptional level.

Also, Moffat seems to be more on the Autism end of things, paying way, way more attention to inanimate details compared to the details of the relationships between living people.  And that's not very interesting to me.

Also that Moffat doesn't always engage with the moral dilemmas when I would like him to. For example, in LKH - not dealing with the moral implications of executing war criminals from the past very much.

I love a lot of Moffat's standalone episodes from series 1-4, and I was really excited about him taking over as showrunner. I think the 5th season was brilliant, but this season is just not working for me, I've been consistently disappointed.",0,1315846645,null,0,false,0,c2jbiqk,t3_kd0r8,t1_c2jbiqk,t1_c2jbdrs,1427590559,2,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,2

I *think* if you're staying less than 6 months you don't need a visa. Above 6 months and you'll definitely need a visa.
