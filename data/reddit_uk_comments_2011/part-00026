The clone of the man who mentioned his son (sorry, I'm terrible with names) will eventually come into a situation where he must kill the original person. His emotions and love for his son are just as real as the original fathers though, and although he feels he has the same claim on his son as Dad #1, the clone will sacrifice himself, or at least protect the Dad because he would never want to take away his son's father.  
  
Our new friend, the cloned Doctor will end up opposing the original people faction, though with much trepidation.  He will become a rather dangerous opponent, as he has the Doctor's wit. He will help the TARDIS crew though when faced with the possibility of having to kill or injure Amy and Rory. If there's one thing the Doctor, cloned or otherwise, wouldn't do (when he's in his right mind), it is causing intentional harm to his companions. I would say that this goes double for Amy and Rory since he seems to be treating Amy like the girl she was when he first met her, protecting her and worrying about her like a father or grandfather figure.

I'm honestly hoping that any hostility, malevolence, charity, or anything else that the clones exhibit mirrors their human originals. They only go to war because that's what the humans would do in their place etc. That's the way it seemed to shape up last episode, and I'm hoping that it does this time as well.

There's nothing newsworthy or in the public interest about a family holiday.  

Or, in another case of someone being subject of media scrutiny; say they were the survivor of a hideous bomb attack, and the papers kept pestering them, but they didn't want to talk about it - again, that person's privacy should be respected.

However, if a person - someone who trades in fame, or is the subject of public notice because of their appearances in media, sport (and who therefore trades on their 'name' as a business) did something morally or legally questionable (adultery, drug taking, beating someone up, tying three midgets up covering them in custard and licking them while simultaneously painting a picture of the queen formed from the entrails of fifteen lambs slaughtered under the full moon in the name of satan while wearing fluffy knickers - the person in question, not satan, etc.) and then they think ""Oh hell, I shouldn't have done that.  What I'll do is get an injunction to stop people reporting on the fact that I *did* do it."" - well, that's just crap, basically.

true,[deleted],null,null,"A few things I've noticed that doesn't get mentioned enough.

In Day of the Moon, Amy saw the Eyepatch Lady when she was awake. The EPL turned her head as if she was talking to somebody else and said, 'I think she's just dreaming.' In Curse of the Black Spot, while Amy was asleep we have heard the only instance of the Eyepatch Lady talking directly to amy. She says something like, 'Calm down you're doing fine.' While Amy was awake in the last episode, the Eyepatch Lady didn't say anything. The eyepatch lady opening the door represents Amy's point of view in the alternate universe. *She is opening her eyelids and shining a flashlight in them to check up on her. *

We know that mirrors can basically lead to other dimensions as seen in Curse of the Black spot. There were countless threads and comments on reddit detailing every suspicious appearance of a mirror in the series. The astronauts helmut, the lake, near Amy when she told the Doctor he was Pregnant, the junkyard Tardis' Mirror and in the bathroom of the underground place in the last episode just to list some examples.

Think about the Dreamlord episode last season. Alternate universes. People were awake in one universe, and asleep in the other. Which appears to be happening to Amy in this season. Also, she was pregnant in one dream/universe and not the other ones during Amy's Choice. The episode ends with the Doctor *looking at his reflection* in the Tardis' glass, and seeing the Dreamlord. 

There are way to many connections with that episode to merely write them off as coincidences. What this means...I have no idea I haven't made it that far. 

Also it's worth nothing the eyepatch is silver and reflective. Similar to the polished silver medallion in curse of the black spot. 

tl;dr Amy is asleep in the Eyepatch Ladies universe when she is awake in 'our' universe and vice versa. Mirrrors = other dimensions. Dreamlord episode was important, in at least the concepts. The Lodger Tardis turned out to be the Silences, so whose to say it really isn't all important?

That wasnt tldr at all... &gt;&gt;

The same amount of Who spread out a bit more, so you don't have to wait as long for the next Who to come along. If he times it right it ought to work OK.

Why is nobody mentioning the doctor’s shoes? Yes, Doctor who is weird, but I don’t think they would pay that much detail to something that isn’t significant. 

The whole Ganger being the doctor is plausible, yet simple. The writers would have put some tiny-winy little connection to point towards that. His shoes! The doctor touched the gooey stuff when he had his old shoes on, thus, it would have cloned his old shoes. The doctor’s shoes then burn in the acid, he gets new shoes. 

In the first episode when the doctor dies, he is wearing his old shoes. The real doctor may have loads of the same shoes in his TARDIS –closet, I guess, but like I said, they made a big deal of his shoes.

Next thing we see is an unconscious Amy and Rory in the Flesh vat room directly next to the tub.

* The Ganger versions of Jen and Cleaves/Miranda (the boss lady) seem to be the polar opposites of their originals. Ganger Jen talks about being the strong version of Jen, and Ganger Miranda was first to entertain the notion of peace and did comment about how the real Miranda was acting. I think that we may see the real versions perform either a role reversal later on around these two (technically four) characters. A Ganger saves the life of the original, or vice versa.

Ngog, Jovanovic, Kyriakgos, Poulsen, Konchesky, Pacheco (I know everyone likes Pacheco but I honestly don't see him being successful in the premier league, he is too small, and lacks the tenacity that a suarez/tevez type player thrives on.

I would like to see Agger and Aurellio stay but given their injury problems I wouldnt be surprised if they are sold as well. And on that note Cole has some experience but would have to take a massive pay cut to be worth keeping.

As to the word from Moffat himself, I try to ignore what show creators say when analyzing an episode.  One, they might lie, but more importantly, it just makes the whole process less fun when you're operating under assumptions given to you from on high.  I prefer my info to come from the episodes.

I personally don't think the Doctorganger is the one killed in Impossible Astronaut either, but I also think the audience is meant to entertain the idea.  Obviously Moffat wanted to convince us at the outset that the *real* Doctor had been killed.  It loses its impact if we don't believe that.  But *right now*, he wants us second guessing ourselves.  The more he keeps the audience guessing, the more hooked we get on the story.

&gt;*This episode was not written by Moffat. Moffat writes the first two episodes, the 7th and 8th middle episodes, and the finale. He clearly has a large plan that does not include using major plot points from other authors.

Rory's death last season (his *real* death and erasure from the timeline) was a major plot point, and it wasn't written by Moffat.  The Lodger is likely to be a very important episode to this season, but it wasn't written by Moffat.  When you're building an overarching story, it benefits to let some important plot points show up in supposedly unimportant episodes.

This is why Netflix really needs to fix this.  There are *four* specials, one of which (inexplicably) is included as the final episode of Season 4 on Netflix Instant.

How Netflix does it now:

**Season 4**

- The Stolen Earth
- Journey's End (Season Finale)
- The Next Doctor (First of the ""Specials"")

Then they have ""Planet of the Dead"" on disc only.  ""The Waters of Mars"" is on Instant, but it is its own title.  ""The End of Time, Parts One and Two"" is the same way - on Instant, but it is its own title.

What Netflix *should* do:

**Season 4**

- Journey's End (Season Finale)
- The Next Doctor (Special 1)
- Planet of the Dead (Special 2)
- The Waters of Mars (Special 3)
- The End of Time, Part One (Special 4)
- The End of Time, Part Two (Special 5)

**Season 5**

- The Eleventh Hour
- The Beast Below ... (etc.)

If you're not familiar with the play but have the opportunity to go, I strongly advise you to give it a chance. Much Ado is a really accessible play and even if you've had no exposure to Shakespeare before, you'll follow the story with no trouble. In fact I think it's a great introduction and tremendous fun.  There's also some real depth there too when you scratch the surface, but at heart it's about entertaining an audience, and it can't fail to do that.  I bet the Tennant/Tate production will have at least a few in-joke staging elements for the whovian crowd as well...

Plus points IMHO are Keanu Reeves as a splendid pantomime-villan Don John, and some great staging (or whatever you'd call that when you film it) - (I love it when Don Pedro's men arrive at the beginning and when they come to a halt in a diamond shape)  There's also a chance to see a younger Robert Sean Leonard (Wilson from House) as a suitably insipid Claudio and I think Hero was played by someone who went on to bigger things too...

The only pre-David Tennant episodes that could ever possibly be released on Blu-Ray in high definition while improving on the quality of the original SD version would be the Third Doctor's debut (*Spearhead from Space*) and the 1996 McGann TV movie, as both of those were shot on 35mm film.  They'd both require upscaling for the effects shots, though, since those were done at standard definition.

The rest of the series, from 1963-2009, was shot on video in standard (PAL) definition.  While you could release these on Blu-Ray in SD (more episodes per disc) or upscale them (""fake"" 720/1080p), there would be little point, as they wouldn't look any better than they do on DVD.

*Planet of the Dead* was the first episode shot in high definition, and it's available on Blu-Ray (alone and as part of the ""Complete Specials"" box set).  From then on, every episode has been produced in HD, and is available on Blu-Ray.

In the ""Complete Specials"" Blu-Ray set, *The Next Doctor* (shot in SD) has been upscaled to 1080p.  It doesn't look any better than the DVD version (my own opinion from comparing the two), so I see no purpose in doing the same for other SD-shot episodes.

So, your best bet is to get Series 1-4 on DVD (if you have a region-free player or live in a PAL country, get the Region 2 DVDs, since they're in their original 25fps PAL format, which has a bit higher resolution than NTSC - 720x576 for PAL versus 720x480 for NTSC) and ""The Complete Specials,"" Series 5 and *A Christmas Carol* on Blu-Ray (no word yet on whether ACC will be included on the Series 6 DVD/Blu-Ray set).

Personally, I chucked the Blu-Ray of *The Next Doctor* from the box set and replaced it with the DVD I bought separately, since (as I said earlier) I don't see any significant difference and I'd like to be able to play it on non-BR players if I want to.

They're not, as the media is protraying: ""Celebrity trying to censor us about his affair!! WAAAAH"".

If they actually cared about censorship they'd be putting the murder of protestors in Bahrain and Yemen on their front page, not some Big Brother slut, looking for money. Super-injunctions are frequently used in criminal proceedings where allegations of criminality have been made, as in this case.


They're nearly always temporary, and imposed by a Judge before a final judgement is made, when lack of secrecy can affect the outcome of a trial or judgement, and are usually to protect information before a trial. 

Anyone who lives in the UK sees frequent evidence of super injunctions in the news all the time. It's when the media start pouring out the details of a trial that has just finished, or some major legal proceedings that have reached a critical point. That's generally the point the injunction has been lifted. You don't hear the Sun whining about that though, because ordinary news doesn't sell nearly as much as celeb trash.

I have a few more questions, though:

* What was the Silence doing to Amy for the 5 days they had her?
* How did River and Rory get out of the cellar when the Silence started doing their electrical thing (it looked like they took Rory out).
* Why was the timehead girl in New York?  (River was also in New York when Canton found her - why was she in an evening gown)?
* Timehead girl regenerated six months after the moon landing which was nine months after the Doctor was shot?  Is that significant?  Wouldn't Amy HAD to have given birth by then if she was actually pregnant?
* Why did River also feel sick?
* Why does the Doctor keep forgetting Rory?
* What does the Silence mean by ""Silence will fall?""  What is their ultimate plan?

I see two themes emerging from last season into this one:  1) parallel worlds and 2) don't trust your eyes - nothing is what it seems to be (they spend a lot of time struggling with fiction vs. reality). 

The big arc last season had to do with Amelia as part of a fairy tale.  The Girl Who Waited became the Girl Who Remembered - way too neat for an ending.  I think this season will be Amy finding that she has to distinguish between fairy tale and reality.  Haven't figured out how yet, but I suspect Moffat is throwing a lot of red herrings out there just to mess with us :)  Oh, I love a puzzle!!

But in general, people dislike Colin Baker's costuming and verbose belligerence, dislike the bad special effects (for some reason people expect mid-90s level special effects from mid-80s television) and say to themselves ""It was just a bad time for the show, so why watch it? Look at the stupid costumes and set designs, blah blah"" The 80s Doctors were all great actors. Some of the decisions made by the production team were questionable and sometimes downright unquestionably bad. A good bit of the writing was bad (The Twin Dillemma and Timelash spring instantly to mind), but if you relax and see it as a continuation of the concepts and characterization of the Doctor, then that era can be a joy to watch. (In other words, watch it with an eye towards trying to find what you like in it and not with an eye to criticize it for not being new Who or Tom Baker-era Who.)

From an in-universe point of view: Most of the Doctor's cofrontations with Davros come during this period, including the 7th Doctor's destruction of the Daleks' home planet of Skaro, which figures into the Time War if you think about it. This era also sees the cybermen revived, and personally I love the plastic mouth windows and David Banks is always always always badass as the cyberleader (If you've seen through 5's run, you saw him in Earthshock.) The idea of a ""dark"" side of the Doctor begins its weave into the narrative with the unstable regeneration of 5 into 6 and continues with him facing an evil version of himself in the Valeyard (Also of note from the Trial of a Timelord is that it is out final glimpse of Timelord society before the hiatus and shows them beginning to take drastic measures to protect their secrets. I also just spoiled the shit out of TTL for you, since you don't learn the Valeyard is a version of the Doctor until episode 12.) You WILL love the badassery of the 7th + Ace team in the TARDIS.
So, no, you won't find a hidden base of fans who love the 80s Doctors, but we do exist and there **are** reasons to love and be interested in that era, even if *most* fans will tell you to skip it.

An, in that vein, I will advise if you skip anything, skip the tv movie. The unholy union of the BBC and Fox (Yes, I LOVE Mcgann in his audios, so I am not an 8-hater.) produced the first onscreen Who in 7 years and you can immediately see within 5 minutes why it wasn't picked up for a series.

The specials wrap up the remaining ones.  There are also some things in the specials there that carry into the newer series.

Moffat wrote many episodes during RTD's run including : Blink, The Girl in the Fireplace, Empty Child/Dcotor Dances, Silence in the Library/Forest of the Dead

Soon enough, Adric was dead, Nyssa stayed on Terminus and Tegan ran off to do whatever. Shortly after that, they gave us a new companion, Peri, and the Doctor regenerated into a loud guy with a crazy coat. Still loved the show. After a couple seasons (seen on PBS in the late 80s in 1.5-2 hour chunks, it went by fast.), I'm watching a short Scottish guy in a question mark coat outwit everyone he meets and blow up planets.

I spent those seven years getting acquainted with what went before thanks to my local PBS station running the whole classic series (or all the complete episodes in existence at the time) over again before setting into the looooong silence of the 1989-1996 hiatus.

What about to the atheist?

Also, you touch upon my original point, you say that people shouldn't be allowed to say something is a sin because they're threatening you with the wrath of god, right?

But your solution is to threaten those same people with the wrath of the legal system, which will really put you in a real prison with real bars on the windows and real rapists and murderers sharing your cell - not some metaphorical punishment in the afterlife.

Your point does not hold water.  Laws are put in place to protect people from those who will exploit them.  Religion is an unproved authority that has no basis in our world, other then the agreement between those who believe in it.  To tell someone that they are going to hell, after all the psychological abuse they may have encountered during their lives is an assault.  Not all offences require jail time.  Some may include community service, punitive damages paid to the victim, etc.  It is proportionate to the offence.  People should be protected from abusive comments from unproven ideologies no matter how popular they may be.  There is no proof of god so anything that is purportedly said by god has no authority and should be treated as fraudulent statements.  If those statements are threatening, then they should be an offence.

Often these people are politically naive, with a grossly inflated view of the importance (to others) of their pet hate (and it's usually a hate). I may strongly desire an end to whaling, but it is your absolute right either not to care or simply not to want to talk about it right now. **The extremist is one who cannot accept that others may not want to play their game.**

I am well aware that muslims try to show that they are peaceful and even write articles to show the lack of links between moderate Islam and extremists.

Only pointing to the possibility of how easy it is to tip the balance to extremism.

This one for example...

If you look at the percents of difference in beliefs etc. they are so close that it is hard to see much difference at all.

I remember the 70s- having a car, washing machine, freezer, colour tv  or phone (single one per household- usually kept in the hall) were luxury items, whilst video recorders, dishwashers, computers, mobiles, xboxes etc were unheard of.
We're far richer than our parents and grandparents- we have more, we consume more and we spend more. We also expect more; which is, I suspect where the idea that living standards have declined comes from.

I agree with your comment that we need to stop borrowing and get competative, but that has to start with a long hard look at the expenses that we as taxpayers pay- I resent subsidising countries, especially Pakistan who have enough money for a nuclear weapons programme, yet are considered in need of economic aid.
I'm also not keen on supporting people who've taken a lifestyle choice to not work and take drugs (legal or otherwise). I meet a lot of these drains on society in my professional capacity- they consider their 'pay' to be a right, along with their housing and health care.

The welfare state used to be a last resort- the replacement for the workhouse (which was in itself a replacement for the poor laws). Now people demand a house for life complete with maintenance and running costs, as well as enough money for them to buy luxury goods.

But as soon as you abuse someone directly with that speech it is no longer about free speech it is an assault.  You can say that you ""believe"" homosexuality is an abomination, but as soon as you tell someone they are an abomination then you have crossed a line.  And you are the one who is creating straw men.  My comments have everything to do with the ""project"" by the muslim brotherhood and you refuse to even acknowledge that there is even a plan in place.  Instead you want to try and discredit me based on a study that has even less to do with the topic.  How long it takes to convert someone from moderation to extremism is only the smallest part of the problem, the problem is that there is a plan in place ""the project"".  If no such plan existed I wouldn't hold the view i have.  Or if the plan was quite different then what we are seeing in the world i would think that it didn't have much effect and isn't a threat at all.

The project got very little attention when it was discovered, with good reason as well.  It would of swayed many people into distrusting muslims and would of contributed to extremism in the other direction.  

That being said, you cannot deny that ""the project"" exists, and even if you told me the Muslim Brotherhood has no influence on Muslims I would have to view that with suspicion since one of the mandates of the project is to not openly have associations with terrorist groups or people.  Also i couldn't trust that you would actually be offended by what i say since Islamic states do not recognise freedom of speech or the universal declaration of human rights for that matter.  Another part of the project instructs muslims to use deception to mask the intended goals of Islamist actions, as long as it doesn’t conflict with shari’a law.

You argue that they only had 4 appearances, but when you consider that the ""episodes"" were done in 4-10 part weekly installments and a season might only have 5 ""episodes"" in it, I'm pretty comfortable with the extent to which I'm not wrong.

You actually gave me a little freebie, though. The Daleks were in *Frontier in Space*, but only at the very end, and that was pretty much a run-up into *Planet of the Daleks.*

Just the same, you can't argue that the Daleks are and have always been regularly recurring villains throughout the series. Also, for the new series, the Time War was Time Lords Vs. Daleks. I'd say if you are going to allow any of them to survive and if you're ever going to have Daleks again, you've got to make sure that it is well established that there are surviving Daleks. 

I'm not saying that the show needs to have them in every season, though. I even think that the audience needs a break from them. The next time we see the Daleks, I'd love for them to be genuinely terrifying instead of the silly things they've been portrayed as lately.

What I'd *really* like to see, though, is a return to the complete storyline method that was used back then. Everything being open ended as it is now makes it less approachable. If I wanted to show someone a story in old Doctor Who, I could pop any of them on and the viewer would get a whole story and the gist of the show.

The same isn't really true now. I couldn't even tell you how many developing plots are going on right now. If I listed out 20, I'd probably be missing another 60.

true,[deleted],null,null,"I guess there are two sides to it in my mind.

The first is that Giggs, Woods and Ashcroft never made their names on being family men.  Giggs was paid to play football, not to maintain the perfect marriage.  Ashcroft was a politician, not a marriage councillor.  

So they have every right to say ""fuck off, what I do behind closed doors is private"".  If they held themselves up as good husbands anymore than the next footballer, golf pro or whatever then so bit it, name and shame them.  But they didnt.

If people expected them to be something other than sportsmen and politicians then that is their problem; Im an engineer, I dont expect to be outed to my colleges and clients as an adulterer because I engineer for them, I dont give them sex advice.  Its the same for footballers.

I also think that there are a lot of serious cases of lies and fraud in the UK that go totally un reported (look at Private Eye some time) exactly because papers would rather run stories about people having ""naughty sex"" than to actually expose abuse of power.  It really does feel like listening to a load of 12 year olds.

Since the entire purpose of a free press is to do the latter rather than the former I find it pretty grating to hear any (let alone all) of them chat about their ""right"" to print celeb gossip when they should be reporting things like the expenses scandal. 

Finally, many (most?) of these allegations seem to be either totally false or at least without any proper evidence to back them.  Take the non sense about Clarkson, both he and the woman in question deny it but somehow its still right for it to be reported?

The stories are not only questionable but even if they were true its still no public interest and it obscures things that are both true and important.

Im sorry if you think that people need to know the details of the lives of the people they look up to in order to have a better grip on reality, I do understand that view, but I think that really we just need to grow up and stop assuming ever famous person is an alright bloke (or female equivalent) then being shocked that they are not...

I think that they should shut the fuck up, because they own homes that will still be very valuable even with HS2 running nearby.

The problem with throwing kids into the first team at a team like Chelsea, is that if they make one mistake the spotlight/magnifying glass on that is huge compared to other clubs. I fear they're simply too young to properly deal with the pressure bestowed upon them, and it's easy for a mistake to ruin their confidence, form and future. Start them off easy at a smaller club and let them grow. If they're like Sturridge and show they're ready now, play them now. Otherwise allow them to keep developing.

Allowing this team to slip out of the CL is simply out of the question. Roman wants to always challenge/win that trophy, and the attraction CL football has for new players, as well as the money earned from it, is too enticing.

true,palehorse864,null,null,"Absolutely not. Last week was brilliant, as expected, and one of my favorites, but this week gave me some of my favorite character moments. 

Rory seemed like a stand up hero in this episode and is reminding me somewhat of the kind and concerned individual that Ian Chesterton was.  Plus, the way he held his hand up when the Doctor asked if anyone wanted fish and chips was great. 

The Doctor also had some real brilliance. The minute he entered, he already seemed 50 steps ahead of everyone else with his knowledge about the flesh stuff.  Plus, instead of trying to pass himself off as a meteorologist for an extended period, he came in and told everyone what was going to happen and how they were going to go about it. For some reason, I enjoy watching the Doctor most when he acts like he's in charge of the situation and tells everyone what's going to happen. 

I've really loved this season for how it's made the characters all feel real, and makes them likeable. The whole ""what's a timehead"" scene with the Doctor and Amy seemed very genuine. It looked like any two close friends palling around. The couples conversations with the Doctor and River from the season opener also seemed quite genuine. Amy has also improved as a character. It was a bit strange in Season 5 that she seemed to have all the solutions to the situation, and the Doctor was just there to give an initial wrong answer. She's still smart in season 6, but less uncannily so, and she seems more like a real flesh and blood person now.",0,1306169594,null,0,true,0,c1vkkq8,t3_hhq3u,t1_c1vkkq8,t3_hhq3u,1427173476,3,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,3

Sorry, but no:

1) As much as a lot of us may giggle thinking that ""OMG that would be cool and so much fun and would make a good 'British' icon"" the torch and carrying it is much much more then that, it's a true athletic icon and means on hell of a lot to people who dedicate their lives to that pursuit. Having Tenant light the flame deprives someone of the right to do something they may very well have been dreaming of since being a child. It's a chance that comes around only every 4 years at best, in practice it's a once in a lifetime chance as the host nation tends to pick the last carrier.

2) It would cause many many people to google/have the TV tell them the reference. Causing their first exposure of Doctor Who to be ""Fear Her"". No matter if you're on the ""Fear Her was utter shit"" or ""Fear her wasn't bad"" camp I think we can all unite under the cause that it's not nearly the best example of an episode to introduce a new viewer into the series with.

3) While Point two is important on it's own I must stress (so hard that I'm using an entire point to do so) that point one is enough. We do not deserve to deprive someone who has worked their entire life to get such a nod of that honor just for an ""in joke"". Those who disagree go read more fanfic.

Colgate sponsors an oral health month every year which aims to educate children and sometimes parents about the importance of good oral hygiene and dietary practices. Our particular practice gets loads of kids in and puts on an interactive demo on loads of things, but we don't do check-ups in that session.

Children get check-ups and treatment for free on the NHS so it surprises me a bit that there are so many children having to visit hospital for treatment. I think part of the problem may be an inadequate level of oral health promotion being carried out. However, I have seen several cases where it just seems that the parents of these children with decay are not bothered at all.

6) Any scandals uncovered are put onto giant billboards in the neighbourhood where the person lives, and leaflet distributed in the area with full juicy details and (if possible) partially censored intimate photographs.  Heck, if the family go to the beach, the wife will be popping through her neighbours' letterboxes the very next day, with comments on her tanline and choice of bikini.

moved to Cardiff 2 years ago and went through pretty much the same as you - in fact I'd likely still be there if I hadn't met the bf at last summer's meetup at the Mochyn Ddu!

I don'T know which side of Cardiff you live in, but there are a few social groups existing which might end up being interesting for you - many meet for example at Chapter in Canton, with focus on movies, books, dance, theatre, name it.  Another option might be to attend part-time courses at Cardiff Uni? You didn't say if you actually are a student, but if you're not, perhaps taking one module a semester on something non-essential that interests you (languages? philosophy? history?) might put you in contact with other people with the same interests, and with evening part-time classes, it is more likely they'd have more time to devote than full-time students.

true,[deleted],null,null,"This is the part where I shoot holes into your entire, feeble argument. You say 'not everything is a logical fallacy'? Well, here goes:

&gt;You do go to 4chan

This is what is commonly known as a strawman. It occurs when someone builds up a separate argument in lieu of the current, on-going argument. Me going to a different website has nothing to do with voicing my disagreement over a bad comic on a Doctor Who-related 'forum'.

&gt;make the assumption

I'll hand that to you, but guess what? You assumed that I'm a child as well, so you can't exactly fault me for something you did as well. Also, you have 'boy' in your name title, so I could easily act like you and call you a kid based off that.

&gt;You are a kid because your face gets oily and you can barely grow facial hair

So, explain to me where you live where every male has a dry face, and grows a full beard the second they turn 18. In reality, this does not happen.

&gt;Anger issues

Because I grew up with an abusive father? This is the part where you talk about things you know nothing about. Let me guess, you grew up in white suburbia where Mommy and Daddy bought you a brand new car the day you turned 16?

&gt;Developing

Because I don't immediately kiss the ass of any female and put females on a pedestal?

&gt;misogyny

""Any negative experiences one would have with a female equates to misogyny."" This is what naive humans actually believe. Remind me, what does this all have to do with my opinion of a comic on the internet?

Yes, it is a logical fallacy when you bring up utterly unrelated events to make up your lack of an argument (read: every one of your links). My favorite part is when you had to lurk my comment history in order to make a reply since you know you've lost and created seven strawmen (that I bothered to read).

I'm disappointed though, as you will get praise for this since you agree with the 'hivemind' of the thread, and despite having the intellectual superiority established in our little dispute, my posts will get downvoted since Reddit prefers popular opinion over honesty.

A few years ago I gave chase to find COTDS on the Internet to no avail until someone posted up an old VHS home recorded rip that was badly damaged - absolutely horrific quality wise but was fantastic to know how the first 3 episodes went as those were ones I missed. These poor quality versions are also on YouTube if you look hard enough.

I just searched on a whim today for any news on a DVD release and was shocked to find I'd managed to miss the release by 3 years! Anyway, with any luck I'll have the DVD in my clutches soon :)

Regarding me as a kid when I saw this series - as a 12 year old I constructed my own KOLOB out of huge amounts of silver cardboard and tin foil, complete with lighted parts and all. Wish my mom had taken photos, damn I so wanted KOLOB and the Daisy Rod to be real.

Did anyone else here do anything similar, felt inspired, or emotional as a result of the series? I personally think it was one of those rare gems that even today would probably stand the test of time.

But I think he has so much more depth than that and continues to grow. He isn't simply defined by his love of a Doctor's companion, though sometimes poeple -- even him, it seems at times -- seem to think that. He has his own attributes and adventures. 

Look at his first meeting with the Doctor -- the Doctor doesn't find him because he's Amy's boyfriend, he finds him because, in a crowd of people, Rory's looking the other way. 

Even setting aside the whole two thousand years waiting thing, even without Amy, even without the Doctor, Rory's still a developed person -- he's a nurse, he has a career, he has dreams. And he has his own opinions on matters.

 Look at one of his later interactions with the Doctor -- *he punches the Doctor in the face*. Not many people can claim that. And he *dies* saving the Doctor's life. And look at this latest episode -- he's running off on his own, going against the common opinion to do what *he* thinks is the right thing. . . 

He's not the talking dog. He's not Mickey. He's a full-fledged, bona fide companion.

They had radio telescopes around the world prepared to receive a signal at any time.  The australians actually recorded the lunar landing, (I believe it was also recorded in the mohave somewhere) They just used a TV camera to shoot a screen in the Australian telescope station.  This was sent around the world.

The technology was very different, they used a ""slow scan"" format because most of the wavelength used to transmit the signal, was also used to transmit telemetry from the orbiter and lander.  This information was much more vital then the images, (which they didn't even know would work) so the images were given last priority and just a sliver of wavelength.

Because of this unusual format, the originals were never released to the public.  It was easier, and cheaper for TV stations to record the one broadcast.  Only a handful of people saw the original footage.

Interestingly, much of the moon landing footage was lost due to an error at NASA where they taped over the god damn things to make room for other recordings (Sound familiar Whovians?).

The new deal offered good working opportunities in interesting vocations, but only to people who were ""chronically unemployed"" (18 months+), in my experience anyone could get some sort of work within 18 months if they wanted. I originally left school and started in the work place with no experience I was working, but wanted to better myself at 19, I would see these ""new deals"", that would give me a qualification, and good work experience, but couldn't apply as I hadn't been sitting on my ass for 18 months. A friend of mine went on a new deal course with the BBC, and said the vast majority of the group had no interest in media, they just went because the dole office made them, most eventually started mitching, then stopped going altogether.

I hate to generalise, but a lot of the long term unemployed, really don't want to work anymore, but people who try to find work wherever they can and end up working temporary contracts through agencies (which is the only working going at the minute), have no way to better themselves with help of the government. You basically end up working a series of min wage jobs, with a patchy CV, which makes apply for good jobs harder.

As for the jobcentre they have never been of any help to me at all, on my fortnightly signing on, they tell me to ""keep doing what i'm doing"", ""you'll probably unemployed for a while, there isn't much work out there"", and that's whenever I ask for help, otherwise they just get me to sign the form and barely 2 words are spoken. When I asked about training courses, and how to get funding, they told me ask a local college.

As for other initiatives being withdrawn, I couldn't tell you, as I have never been offered them.

In summary, I think the jobcentre has been fucked for a long time, if you want to find a job, go to a recruitment agency, search online, and be prepared for a long wait. ",0,1306237449,null,0,false,0,c1vpyp9,t3_hisnv,t1_c1vpyp9,t3_hisnv,1427176015,33,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,33

now, we live in a fairly liberal society (individual autonomy etc) the benefit system does not fit with this model as in a liberal society, in order to be truly free, you have to have the possibility of failure, which has been utterly taken away by a benefit system that throws money at people at the first sign that they might be sinking. this freedom to failure leads to innovation and an urge to actually get up and do something: anything. 

i have no problem with a benefit system, so long as the money goes to the people who need it: not to people who do not want to work, but want to just laze about on money given to them by the government, having children too early only for them to go through the same motions in a few years.

*Time-Flight* and *Arc of Infinity* are both canon, so we can't exclude items due to poor quality.

For example, the amount of times that basic errors in data entry have enabled the stagnation of peoples obtaining work or even obtaining the correct benefit is staggering, e.g., a COPD sufferer seeking employment of no more than sixteen hours per week (on the advice of their GP), who was previously employed on a part-time basis, having their entitlement cut off for not seeking employment of 30 hours per week. The result being no income for two months and having to take a crisis loan £50 for a bus pass and food, with this being their only income during this period. Hardly helping someone back into work by making their situation even more desperate and this is by no means the most extreme example nor out of the ordinary.

Most people do want to work and actively seek it. What the Job Centre is most guilty of is not being properly organised. From personal experience as a yoot, the most frustrating experience I would have with the Job Centre was the amount of jobs I was offered that were already filled, unapplicable to me, non-existent or weeks/months out of date.

That said, I think it's time Bosingwa, Malouda, and Anelka move on. Zhirkov is 50/50 for me, he'd be a good depth player but only at left back really. It might be time to give van Aanholt a real shot, he always looked good when filling in for Cole and the time might be right for him. If Drogba does move on (that would make it the worst summer ever for me), I hope he doesn't go to Spurs. That would be suicide for us.

Hopefully we hold onto all our youth players, but Borini looks to be pretty much gone. I think this year will be the year we either give Mancienne a shot with the first team or he moves on. He's had enough loan spells. 

Do we try to let Benayoun move on? Or give him another year? If we go after another creative midfielder it may prove to be too many. I would like to see Aguero come into the squad at this point, he's looked good in Europe and he's young and available.

true,Matriss,tardis,TARDIS,"I love Rose Tyler, and honestly I don't see the Mary Sue qualities everyone always attributes to her (Martha was worse).  She had great chemistry with 9 and there's no reason it shouldn't have continued to 10, they're the same person.

Between her, Martha, and Donna, she had to ""relearn"" the most to get a bigger view of the universe and had, I thought, the most character development.  The Gelth episode?  ""It's a new morality, get used to it or go home.""  She didn't like it, but she did understand it after a minute.  It got to the point where she was comfortably infiltrating places on her own without specific prompts from the Doctor.

People also like to rag on her about ""taking the regeneration personally,"" but they forget that we come at it from an bystander perspective.  We know it's fictional, we know it happens, we expect it.  She *doesn't.*  The Children in Need scene from 2005 does a great job underlining it, her first instinct is to be suspicious and assume something's gone horribly wrong.  This is a perfectly normal reaction for a seasoned companion.

Her character could have easily worked without the romance angle, and I even got the feel that that wasn't necessarily the intention, it just happened naturally.  Well, mostly.  I'm even of the fan opinion that the Doctor's regenerations are influenced by the events directly leading up to his death--Rose was pretty much the entirety of 9's final experiences so it makes sense for 10 to be very attached to her.",0,1306245464,null,0,false,0,c1vqfgp,t3_hio8f,t1_c1vqfgp,t3_hio8f,1427176320,7,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,7

I'm mostly shocked by how much the money coming in from TV/sponsorship and commercials are increasing. Doubling of shirt and kit sponsor was huge, but also the TV rights seem to double every 3-5 years which is insane. 

The other thing is how the club went from sound financially to debt ridden the instant they took over, I don't understand why there isn't a regulation that stops people from buying clubs with borrowed money. Are the club supposed to pay for your non-club related loans?

That we need a new ground or expansion is no longer a doubt, although it seems expansion isn't cheap, and it has to be built while the seasons are on.

City need a lot of developing before they get to pass us, but it seems with more seats and stable CL play we could easily join the top 5 in revenue.

That said how will at the rate revenue is growing people not see doubling of prices on players? If you make twice as much as you did 5 years ago (not profit as for some reason wages seem to constantly keep up with money coming in) it will only make sense that the cost of players increase. If you club makes 500mill a year in 5 years, it only makes sense to keep transfers proportional to the profit at least.

true,MagnifiedAttitude,null,null,"Fair enough, you make a good point - especially about Season 6B, which must be one of the only instances of a fan theory *having* to be canon.

To draw an analogy which may only muddy the waters - but I'll try to clarify it at the end - I'll compare Doctor Who to Nintendo's Legend of Zelda series. I don't know if you're familiar with it, but essentially it's a series of games which take place in the same mystical land, revolving around the clashes between our protagonists, Link and Zelda, and the antagonist, Ganondorf. Each game takes place generations away from any other, and so the Link and Zelda (being pretty-much human) in each game are *different* Links and Zeldas - while it's the same never-dying villain, Ganondorf,  in each game.

Many attempts have been made by fans to come up with a complete timeline to the Zelda series, tying all the games together. Nintendo themselves have said they do in fact have a complete timeline locked up somewhere, but recently a member of one of the localisation teams said Nintendo will never release it. The reason for this being that the series of games construct a mythology, a fairytale about the triumph of good over evil, time and time again. To release the timeline of the Legend of Zelda series would take away the Legend.

So after having written *way* too much about this, my point is - perhaps we should view Doctor Who as just that: a fairytale, a myth, a legend about a strange man from a distant world who triumphs over countless evils. While the details may shift and change over time, the essence of who The Doctor is and what his stories tell will more or less always remain the same.",0,1306250411,null,0,false,0,c1vquo5,t3_hijjs,t1_c1vquo5,t1_c1vqbfr,1427176509,2,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,2

In early 2000 I went through what was then known as 'restart' through the dole after leaving school in the midst of the recession we had in the late nineties. I went to work on a government led scheme by blair to get everyone on the internet. People on benefits would get a desktop PC with a modem for 50 quid which they cold pay for by instalments of 2 pounds a fortnight. I worked 5 days a week unpacking desktops and monitors from crates, PAT testing them and then ghosting an image on to them. In return I got 35 pw and housing benefit and a city and guilds in computer electronic servicing.

From there I went to ICR (independent computer repairs in Plymouth) where I worked from 6am to 2pm making 11k a year doing laptop repairs on acer kit :)

After that I got made redundant :( but then lady luck smiled down on me and I got an interview to maintain a small network of developers PC's for a local software house. I showed them my experience and willingness to learn which got me a 'try out' period. 

My time with the software house taught me loads (namely how to develop and work in the commercial side). This then led to further jobs being gained until I got a foothold into telecoms where I now earn a very good wage and have a Job I really enjoy.

Still, all of this may change as nothing is sure in life. But I know if I did I would be out working cleaning contracts for some agency of stacking shelf's for tescos.

In fact most of England's actions in the 1690s practically crippled Scotland's economy which meant they had to concede to Union in 1706/1707. 

Obviously there were other flaws to the Darien Venture other than William III's lack of support but his fears of jeopardising his Grand Alliance against Louis XIV by annoying the Spanish led to way more problems than they could have originally expected to encounter.

Im in NI at the moment, and on the dole after redundancy. about 25% of the jobs I *could* do, I cannot apply for because they are reserved for people who have been on benefits for 18 months or more. This is a waste of time for the following reasons:

1. Some waster gets stuck in a job they don't want at all and will do their utmost to get through it and get back to the couch after the 26 weeks is up.

2. The employer has no incentive to offer anyone an actual position, because the jobcentre pays them to hire people to give them experience. Without this scheme, it would be an actual job I could apply for.

3. Almost everyone who would benefit from this menial job, and would be happy to get the experience to enable them to get into a job, would at the 18 month mark more than likely be off benefits and in an actual job.

I would honestly have no problem working for my dole money. I think 40 hours a week for £60 is balls though. I joint claim with my partner, and we get £212 a fortnight. So about £53 a week each. Taking the minimum wage etc into account, I would be more than happy to do 10 hours work a week to earn my dole. I would prefer it to benefit the community in all honesty, because it will instill some values in people wasting their lives. If they do make me work for it though, I would want them to be willing to provide an up-to-date reference for a future employer.

The only problem with my suggestion is I know how it would end up. The lazy fucks who can't be arsed to get up would complain that ""cleaning the streets/grafitti/etc is what criminals do for community service"" then it ends up in some human rights court in Europe costing taxpayers millions to defend both the state, and the idle people pursuing this with financial aid lawyers.",0,1306257569,null,0,false,0,c1vrmuj,t3_hisnv,t1_c1vrmuj,t1_c1vr019,1427176878,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

Let me qualify my position a bit better; I am referring to the long term unemployed of 2yrs +. I live in a town where I personally know quite a few people who fit this description and a lot of them do believe they are above most menial work, yet they have no experience or qualification to net a better position so really as it stands they are not going to work and its easier for them to grind it out stay on the dole and get pissed and stoned to block it all out. 

Meanwhile we have lots of the local area looking a total mess with graffiti and a real run down look and feel which adds even more to everyone's apathy and lack of empowerment to make a change in the life's of themselves and what is their community. My belief is that if a lot of these folk could work on fixing these areas up and improving life for all. They could even learn skills by placing security lights and a new look and feel down the piss stinking underpass which people are two scared to walk down. They could fix up the kids playground which through neglect has turned into a drinking area for the local brew heads. 

The beauty of this is that they would have personally vested into their own community and so would be more protective over it and have a sense of pride over 'my local area' which would be the opposite of what currently stands where no one seems to give a shit.

Your other points were good: the reliability of eyewitness testimony etc make individual cases hard to judge.

But there is overwhelming evidence of widespread abuse by officers.  I would also note that I work in the area in which the assault by PC Harwood occurred, and I went to see the demo on my lunchbreak.  It was quite  peaceful.

I got back to the office and watched the live footage on Sky: my firm impression was that the police were deliberately trying to provoke violence.

true,emptyhunter,cnty-expat,Expat m8,"Basically the US instituted lots of welfare to work/workfare schemes where welfare recipients had to work for the benefits they received. The people who were typically enrolled in these schemes were single mothers from incredibly impoverished backgrounds.

But they worked for profit making companies for much less than it would cost to employ a typical worker and when these people were finally moved from these schemes they remained in poverty and nothing really changed - some people even argue that the scheme has hastened the rise of inequality and poverty.


""The TANF program does not offer benefits sufficient to lift recipients out of poverty, and despite a strong economy, the majority of families who have moved off the TANF rolls have remained in poverty. Considerations of another traditional economic goal, reduction of inequality, only makes matters worse. Welfare reform has coincided with massive growth in income and wealth disparities; it has done little to slow the expansion of inequality and may have actually accelerated the trend. Has welfare reform created job opportunities for the poor? Has it promoted wages that allow low-wage workers to escape poverty? In both of these areas, the economic story remains the same: we have little evidence that reform has produced achievements that warrant the label of success.""[17] (from wiki, cited from a book so can't link)

I haven't got a source that says it has increased unemployment because it was instituted at a time where the US economy was booming but it hasn't actually helped fight poverty which is what a welfare system should be doing as well.

Now everyone is entitled to their own opinion, but I think series 5 &amp; what we've seen of 6 have had *far* superior writing.

After rewatching Vincent and the Doctor, the affection the Doctor has for Van Gogh is really apparent and touching, especially when he tries to console him or talk to him about depression, and he blames himself when he thinks that his arrival might have done more harm to him than good. Ultimately he can't save him, but he points out to Amy at the end that life is full of good things and bad things and you can't let the bad things spoil the good things and make them unimportant. That seems to be how his character rolls. He picks himself up and finds something to keep him smiling. He's not less deep for it, and he's not unaffected by the tragedies he witnesses, but he has his own kind of wisdom for dealing with them.

The writing and stories seem much stronger and the effects are less cheesy. (Not that I don't love some cheese, I still watch Tom Baker episodes with glee!)

You're right about the episodes you listed. When Tennant got a great story to play out, he was absolutely fantastic. ""Family of Blood,"" ""Blink"" and ""Midnight"" are still my favorite Who stories. If Tennant had been given more consistently good material to work with like these, I would have been in heaven but you have to admit, there were many, many stinkers during his run.

Matt Smith on the other hand seems to have a great amount of solid episodes and his ""monster of the week"" ones arn't just awful throwaways like some in the earlier days. I don't think I would have warmed to Smith so quickly if the writing for his run hadn't been top notch. 

I agree that his Doctor seems to have less depth and emotional turmoil but I find his quirkiness enough to make him a believable Doctor for me. I think perhaps we were all just so used to Tennant's crazy bipolar type emoting that Matt Smith seems very subtle in comparison. I still think he's quite a good actor and shows emotional range but he's just not screaming in your face all the time.

I've been watching since the Jon Pertwee days, although I really grew up on Tom Baker.  He was always and forever *my* Doctor - until Matt Smith came along.  I've been stunned by the quality of Smith's performance; he fully deserved his BAFTA nomination.  Actually, he deserved to win.

I love Ecclestron and Tennant as actors in other works, but I felt their time on the show was marred by overemoting (I sometimes felt Tennant was being paid by the gurn).  The show was then, I think, deliberately targetting a younger audience through both of their reigns, and personally, I found those series frequently offered too little for grown-ups (although my nephew ate it up like fish custard, as his Ood sticker-covered fridge still attests).  

Right now, I think the show is by far the best it has *ever* been, reaching levels of subtlety and maturity that it lacked with the reboot's previous Doctors.  And a massive portion of the credit must go to Smith for this.  He is mesmerising on screen, at once old, young, playful, raging, and *barking mad*.

Fezzes are, indeed, cool.

I would say Eleven is my Doctor. I click with him better than I did Nine or Ten.

I wouldn't say he's less deep; as someone else mentioned, he blew up in Beast Below, and the pained expression on his face whenever Amy was crying over Rory was pretty telling, not to mention the way he was with Van Gogh, or when he let the little boy go for his headphones in the Hungry Earth/Cold Blood one. 

In my opinion, he prefers to just play it off when he's feeling upset, preferring to do something else or be extra silly to offset when he's depressed or hurt or worried. I think that works well with his wisdom/cluelessness. He's a Doctor of angsty, meaningful looks rather than bursting into tears, and I don't know if that makes him less deep, or more well-adjusted.

He was my first Doctor (bar some old-Who I saw when I was really young) and he's really easy to empathise with. Part of that's due to Tennant's acting, and partly due to his characterisation by the writers - he reacts exactly like you want him to, exactly like you expect him to. That's very easy on the part of the viewer to relate to, and his righteous anger is incredibly watchable.

However, since watching Smith, these qualities which I initially found very appealing in Tennant, I now find less so. The Doctor *shouldn't* be human, he should have these alien reactions and a completely mind-boggling way of viewing things - and Smith does this very, very well.

I agree to an extent with what you're saying about the inquiries needing to stop, we simply can't fund an inquiry into every death during the troubles period. But i would say that there are no inquiries into murders by paramilitaries, only those with a possible link to security forces. There's a serious differences in these, Bloody Sunday saw innocent, unarmed catholics (not necessarily nationalists) shot by members of the British Army. Rosemary Nelson was possibly targeted for representing certain people and, having reported multiple death threats to the RUC, claimed she wasn't being protected by the security forces. I've heard people ask why there's no inquiries into all the ""protestant"" murders and that it's incredibly biased, but Billy Wright had an inquiry into his death because of suspected collusion within the Maze. The murders by paramilitaries are/were disgusting, but the mainstream see them as terrorists on both 'sides' and have dwindling support, the idea of our security forces helping with the murder of another human like an assassination deserves an inquiry if they are to gain the trust and show the masses that they've changed.

I think Matt Smith has admitted to being delighted and inspired by the grouchy madcappery of Doctor Two, and has possibly even deliberately moulded his performance along those lines, so there's definitely an argument to be made that he is, at the very least, tipping his hat (a cool one) to the old days.  


I also suppose that elements of my childhood adoration of Doctor Who and all things SF (even Blake's 7) will never fully dissipate; and they may still have some input into in my preferences, even now.


But I suspect, however, that comparing the modern series' of Who to the classics could be a bit of a red herring.  TV back then had a kind of charmingly basic cheapness to it, cameras didn't swirl about majestically, they stayed put.  Special effects budgets might stretch to a couple of edwardian costumes and a bodkin, if you were lucky.  A lot of shows were very much in the manner of a recorded stage play, lots of talking and talking and talking.  Being very young childen, though, fascinated by nearly everything, we were more than capable of investing our favourite shows with all the magic and adventure they needed - via our ever-exploding imaginations.  (To show that the above is the case, we now have the wonderful tool of youtube, through which we need only investigate, say, the first series of Rentaghost to shatter the nostalgic illusions that telly back then was intrinsically virtuous).


What I'm trying badly to say briefly is that for me, the MoffatSmith extravaganza has a new joy and a wonder - one all of its own.  Apart from the bits still floating around in my head from 1980.

And Amy and the Doctor rarely discuss their relationship, but you know exactly what it is because of how they look at each other.

I think Tennant's Doctor is WONDERFUL, and I liked Tennant a lot.  But he's a stage actor.  Smith is a screen actor.  It feels like the writers have adapted their styles a bit, which allows Smith room to grow the Doctor in the spaces between the lines and the words.

&gt;""I am not into bashing the police as on the whole I believe they do a good job. They are, however, poor at weeding out the thugs that they do have (all jobs have some wankers - it is more important that bodies like the police get shot of them). This Harwood creature has form for violent conduct and the police knew it - [he left the Met after an an alleged road rage incident and managed (God knows how) to join Surrey police where he has been accused of using excessive force before moving to the TSG](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/g20-summit/7905549/G20-riots-Policeman-who-struck-Ian-Tomlinson-faced-two-previous-aggression-inquiries.html) (who even I think are pretty much lawless thugs)"".

An ex-police officer, who also happens to be married to a police officer replied:-
&gt;""I have never made any secret of the fact that I am an ex met officer and married to a met officer, and I think that is fair comment. Even when an officer is not very well liked, other officers are not very keen to report them. I think it is easy to develop a bit of an 'us and them' mentality (look at a few of the posts on here, with people claiming that the police are ""all"" thugs and racists, and you can see how that might happen), with the ethical belief that reporting a fellow officer is 'grassing'. And the police have always been a bit inclined to move people under a cloud rather than remove them. So a dodgy dog handler, for example, will find himself walking the beat on a division much less convenient than the area he has been working in, and he feels punished, but of course it doesn't look like it to the public. Obviously there are questions to answered about his background. And - it sounds like a detail, but it really isn't - about him covering his face with a scarf. Wtf? On the whole, police officers loathe and detest people covering their faces (for obvious reasons) so I am amazed that a colleague or supervising officer didn't order him to stop being a prat"".

That right there - the ones that behave like cunts, and are known to be cunts but there is a lack of willingness to admit it and chuck them out. I personally believe these creatures are few and far between but really the rest of them really are reluctant to dob them in. You could argue that in the general run-of-the-mill policing that goes on in the UK (we are not talking of SWAT teams breaking into people's houses and shooting their dogs - don't even google that, you will get very cross) that yeah, just shuffle the useless wankers into some side job but not getting rid of the remarkably few bad apples does enormous harm to the image of the police in the UK and in the case of Mr Tomlinson, contributed to his death.",0,1306287882,null,0,false,0,c1vuv81,t3_hit0b,t1_c1vuv81,t1_c1vqwjr,1427178401,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

The writing was definitely uneven, but I was okay with that until it got to the end when it was just like... everyone, including the audience, got beat over the head with sticks repeatedly. Everything was so depressing, characters wound up in incredibly frustrating situations, and eventually it was just so depressing that I was numb to it all and mostly just irritated. It wasn't really any fun anymore to watch a guy spiral downward while the universe shits on him. 

That being said, I'm also not a fan of RTD due to what he did in Torchwood and CoE, which was amazing television, but also pretty incredibly gutwrenchingly depressing with characters dying prematurely and horrible situations for everyone and everything getting destroyed. From what I understand, the idea is to have a touch of realism -- things are more than likely to turn to shit if Torchwood were real -- but for me, it reached needless extremes. 

So my bitterness over Torchwood carries over into RTD's Who, which was better, but still left me exhausted by the time of the last few specials, and not in a good way.

Jobcentres get powers to fine 


 The Welfare Reform Bill is reaching the end of its line-by-line examination by a committee of Members of Parliament. It has been a chilling experience to listen to from the public gallery. It could be described as a Bill for the imposition of unmanageable debt on benefit claimants. 

 Thousands of decision-makers in Jobcentres throughout the UK are being given unprecedented discretion to impose sanctions, penalties and overpayments, on top of the rent arrears created by the housing-benefit caps, on unemployment incomes. They have far greater powers to fine unemployed citizens and taxpayers than in the magistrates' courts, without the legal advice available through the clerks and the proviso that fines should be proportionate to income, expenditure and debts. 

 The damage done by debt to the mental and physical health of benefit claimants reported by the Government Office for Science, the Royal College of Psychiatrists and Mind is the blind spot in the Treasury and DWP thinking; it creates substantial costs in the NHS. 

 A remarkable example of that is Clause 111 of the Bill which permits Jobcentres to fine claimants £50 for making an innocent error on their application forms. The present unemployment benefit of someone aged between 18 and 25 is £53.45 a week, which will also be repaying any overpayment arising from their errors. 

 Jobcentres never volunteer the information that they are not legally allowed to enforce repayment of overpayments arising from their own £2.2bn of innocent errors in 2009-10, excluding HMRC and council tax delivered in error.

I have made an assumption that is this: The Life organisation have not been plucked from obscurity to join this panel, they will have already been making some effort to put across their point of view. [Their website](http://www.lifecharity.org.uk/our-organisation) talks about their visiting schools to give talks to kids, for example.  
Their main reason for being is their work to reduce abortion. Fair enough, while very much at odds with my opinion, I appreciate that their position of being 'against all abortion on principle' is a position which can be debated. *However*, their other work which comes into the limelight in this context is their nation-wide 'education' program on sexual abstinence. This is where their position crumbles. It has been proven [citation needed] time and time again that abstinence only sex education simply does not work, in fact achieving the opposite of it's goals and leading to a rise in unwanted pregnancy (leading to *more* abortions, not less) and STIs.  
I believe it was Isaac Asimov who said ""Anti-intellectualism has been a constant thread winding its way through our political and cultural life, nurtured by the false notion that democracy means that 'my ignorance is just as good as your knowledge.'""   
I invite debate of my opinions. If I'm proven wrong then I've learned something. But to do so my opponent must be prepared to [back up their opinions with fact](http://atheistatlarge.org/articles/uploads/2010/12/Debate-Flow-Chart.jpg). This is especially important in government, but once again (I'm thinking specifically of drugs policy here) the government appears to be inviting opinions that have nothing but bluster and puritanical religious overtones behind them. (That is why I referred to their opinion as 'doctrine'). The Life organisation is not just being given opportunity to voice their opinion, they are being given preferential voice in advising governmental policy.

Then every month my expenses look like £1500 income

* 350 Rent

* 80 Groceries

* 80 Petrol

* 155 Travel Card to work

* 80 “regular” (Love film is £8 a month, mobile phone is another £35, gym membership is £27)

* 350 Savings

* 200 Cash 

* 200 Set Aside

The last column is the total of all the big expenses I list (Car insurance etc) divded by 12.

Saving goes to an ISA, Set aside goes straight to another account which I only touch if I have paid for something on the list this month.  Every week I take out £50 in cash to spend on whatever (lunch, going out, take away, CDs, computer games, books, whatever).

I find this works really well because there is some constant order to actually saving.  So my savings don’t get run down by big expenses.  I also find I spend less on crap when I do it in cash.  So I have to decide if Im going to go to the cinema on Friday or get pissed tonight or buy a new game.
I never use my debit/credit card except for fixed expenses like petrol and groceries and top take the cash out.  If I want a better holiday then I put the money aside, in cash in a pot somewhere at home.
If its not in my wallet I don’t spend it and to be honest, I don’t miss spending it.

However with the approaching CL filled season we will need more options to bolster both our attack and defense. 

Boateng looked good at the World cup and as long as injuries arent nagging he should be good to swap into the back. 

Boyata has also looked good these past two seasons under Mancini.. when he plays. 

Tevez it appears is headed for Italy or Spain. And is really tarnishing his image in my eyes. I followed Tevez here from United when I was a new to soccer and fell in love with City because of the swagger they put off. And if he is leaving we need a bulldog to replace him in attack. 

A. Sanchez of Udinese would look good on our wing or even Hazard of Lille.. however it doesnt appear either team will part with their young talent. But when City come calling who knows what can happen... 

I would love to see Kaka' or Hamsik brought in to fill the void Tevez will be leaving in our hearts.

Hard work though and as my dad was the head chef it meant very long hours till about 11/midnight (remember I'm like 14 or 15 so I thought I was some sort of Batman for staying up so late).  The people I met though were nice, Sean Conery, Colin McRae flying in on his helicopter though I missed JK Rowling and I was gutted at that.  The food was orgasmic, after all the chefs had left and it was just me and my Dad while he was away doing his paperwork and ordering and staffing after his shift I'd be off into the walk in referitor playing with the lobsters and eating all the strawberries and icecream and all the sweets you could imagine, then walking down the dark celar where all the nice fine wine was kept and the kegs.

Those were the best work days I can remember rocking out with the chefs and testing/stuffing my face with all the nice foods that I and the other chefs prepared while listening to the radio.  (surprised it got reception, the kitchen was 2 floors underground)

The reason I thought of that flowchart is that I think it echoes a key point that is pivotal here. I think of debate as a formal, structured arguement between two or more parties.

In turn, politicians must be held accountable, which ultimately means they need to show sound reasoning behind their decisions. In that regard, opinion (or faith) in the absence of hard evidence has no place in debate.

Well what happened is that I was living in Nottinghamshire and was on benefits for ages due to the lack of work in the area. As part of my ""agreement"" with the job centre the only steps they would accept was looking for work in the local area.

So eventually my boyfriend agreed to let me move in with him if I could find some work, the only problem is that he was in Manchester. So that week when I signed on I explained the situation to the Job Centre and asked if I could look for and apply for work in the Manchester area instead. They said yep.

Next time I signed on, I had documented all the stuff that I had applied for but they said it was unacceptable that I was looking in Manchester for work instead of Nottinghamshire. I was absolutely furious with them. I tried to contest it but they wouldn't have any of it.

So in the end I lost a fortnight of benefits because of it. Jokes on them because the very next day I got offered a fulltime software development job in Manchester.",0,1306339316,null,0,false,0,c1vy9s8,t3_hisnv,t1_c1vy9s8,t1_c1vqhi0,1427180075,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

* **What if** the Silence implanted the idea of remembering the Silence into existence when they took Amy capture. If they planted the memory of remembering them into existence... I dunno... this one was a little half formed.

I think what I'm trying to say is this- its the whole circular paradox thingy (forget what it's called) what if the existence of the Silence in universe 2.0 due allowed them to implant the idea into Amy's head in the past allowing for their existence, and then allowed for them to use Amy as a ""mirror"" to get into universe 1.0 to blow up the TARDIS to allow for the creation of universe 2.0 to allow for the remembering of Amy to allow for their existence and so on...

I have the account which my salary is paid into. On this account I have a number of standing orders which transfer money to my other accounts. Since my accounts are separated according to function I know what my expenses are at a glance and I can adjust the standing orders easily online if I need to. 

I have an account for the house. Mortgage payments, utilities and insurance come out of this account. Key benefit: I can see at a glance all monthly expenses related to the cost of having a roof over my head. I pay slightly more than is necessary into this account which is used for any unforeseen house related expenses. At the end of the year anything over and above what I expect to use for those unforeseen occurrences goes into my savings. 

I have a second house which I rent out. This also has it's own account. Expenses for this house come out of here, and rent is paid directly into it. The rent covers all the expenses with a bit to spare. 

The bit to spare goes into a higher interest savings account. I do not touch this at all.

I have an account which I treat as my current account. At my request there is no overdraft facility on this account at all. I can't overdraw and be charged fees on it. I pay myself from my salary account. Groceries and so on come out of here. 

I have an ISA which takes the bulk of the rest of my salary.

I have a savings account which is for anything I can't fit into the ISA without going over the annual limit. It's my rainy day fund.

I want another account which I plan on being my ""public facing"" account. What I want to do with this is request the same no overdraft facility but have any debit cards and so on fed from here. I will only pay into it when I know in advance I want to use my card, which is infrequently. This is intended to prevent me from buying random shit from Amazon and the like without having to jump through hoops first. 

I could do this with the groceries account but having been bitten by the ""keep things separate"" idea I want to continue with it.

Amy's child is Rory. They have to give him somewhere in the past when he's a little kid, and then he grows up and marries Amy and it starts again. Think about it : we never heard or saw Rory's parents, and he's the only companion like that. We even saw Mickey's grandma and Donna's parents, even if she was a grown up. 

The scanner can't decide if Amy is pregnant because it has a hard time making the difference between the genes of the father in the child and the child itself. It's stuck in a paradox where it knows there's something there, but it believes it's just some part of the dad.

Also, Amy's vision. Rory is then born of a paradox : he knows what is going to happen to him because it's already in its genes, therefore he has visions of his grown up self. The woman that Amy sees seems to be a nurse. What's Rory's job again ? Exactly. Because Amy's pregnant, she shares these visions with her child, and therefore sees bits of Rory's past/the baby's future.

But then, old Rory would know who the woman is, and be able to tell Amy he knows the eyepatch lady. He would, but Amy never told anyone, so the paradox stays a mystery.

true,ravniel,num11,,"&gt; And before people come out and say how he set up a lot of goals with Van Der Vaart remember he's only got 6 assist for the season. How can anyone justify this.

He's got 9 assists in the league.  And if memory serves, he had 7 of those by New Years' Day, when Van der Vaart had, if memory also serves, 9 or 10 goals.  With Van der Vaart struggling to return from injury, Peter Crouch's assists have dried up as well.  That's not a coincidence - that strike partnership was working, and I don't think it's crazy to think it could work again, with Rafa back in form.  As I've said elsewhere, with midfield players like Rafa, Harry needs good partners.

And it wouldn't do to dismiss the 7 goals in 10 games Crouch managed in the Champions League.  As Harry said after Crouch's red card against Madrid, without Crouch we'd never have been there in the first place.  For reasons completely unclear to me, Peter Crouch is an asset in Europe.

I'm not actually a big fan of Crouch, never have been, and wouldn't be distressed to see him replaced with someone reliable.

She got the worst treatment from the Doctor, he was often ignoring or discounting her and her feelings (not even speaking of her romantic feelings, just her feelings in general).  She still stood by him time and again, even after he tried to leave her back at her flat.  She was stubborn enough to make him sit down and tell her the truth about himself and then again to put her foot down and demand to be treated as a partner and not a guest on the TARDIS.

Even after spending two and a half months being his servant in 1913, and then another three (according to Moffatt, who wrote Blink) working and taking care of him again in 1969, she still turned right around and spent a year saving the earth and basically being his ""apostle"" all by herself.  THEN she had the strength to leave him on her own volition because she knew that was what was best for her.  After that she became an amazing Doctor and rose high into the ranks of UNIT quickly (although, some of that was based on the Doctor's recommendation.)  

When she finally met the girl who's shadow she lived in for the last few years of her life, her reaction was happiness for the Doctor and Rose, not jealousy or cattiness like with Rose met Sarah Jane.   Martha was the worst treated and had the hardest time during her adventures of the companions and still came out with the most clearly happy ending.

true,bowling4meth,english,Straight out of Surrey,"&gt; If I was earning as much as her, I would not care.

You would. I used to earn a working class wage in the 70s and was very much in favour of paying taxes, but over the course of my career realised that actually much of my taxes go towards funding things that don't actually help people (in the genuine sense of the word - people might be employed by the state to dig and fill in holes but it's not really helping the greater good for example), and that the state actually takes more than what it contributed to my growth when I was successful.

As someone who was a working class socialist, a liberal in the early 80s and almost card carrying sell-out tory towards the end of the 80s before realising they were all in it for themselves in their own way. I had it. Lost it. Had it. Lost (some of) it again. It's not about toys, it's about the feeling of having the rewards of your hard work taken away from you. I'm groping around for words to explain but I can't. At peak I made (adjusting for inflation) more than her, paid less tax and still felt robbed, not because I didn't think it wasn't right to give back, but it's really hard to find the words to explain the feeling. It's a bit like a combination of being robbed and being unfairly penalised for being successful, as though taking that much affects future success. I can't really explain it in text very well, it just feels really wrong, which when you reconcile with poorer people sounds daft, but agh fuck it I can't quite explain it but it's there.",0,1306363663,null,0,false,0,c1w0xpd,t3_hjvg3,t1_c1w0xpd,t1_c1w0q0z,1427181327,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt; I feel like the focus is on the wrong part of her point, that she doesn't like paying high tax for BAD services.

You are right, and it's a point worth highlighting.  It is still a rather ill-considered remark regardless.  

&gt; Trains are always late, most state schools are shit, and I've gotta give you, like, four million quid – are you having a laugh?

It just invites the obvious rejoinder: how is you _not_ paying that four million quid possibly going to see those bad schools improve, compared to if you _do_?

Cart, horse; chicken, egg; etc.  Debate amongst yourselves whether they're shit because people avoid paying, or whether people avoid paying because they're shit.

Also, yes, you could counter in turn with the argument that her 4 million quid will end up going to &lt;fund a war&gt;, &lt;insert thing you don't like govt spending on here&gt; rather than actually improving schools too.  Potentially valid line of debate, also.  Not one she got into though; she was apparently stuck at the ""omg I don't like parting with my money"" part, which is never going to win the average person's heart when most of us are paying x% and having thousands, rather than millions, left over, where x is &lt; 50, but proportionately _less_ less than our income is less than her income.

(In fairness, of course, we don't know how she was misquoted or selectively quoted.  For all I know she went on to engage in a deeply thoughtful discussion about progressive taxation systems which the magazine didn't see fit to reproduce.

Someone taking 50p of every pound I earnt by making music, after which I'm left with millions, enough for a life of luxury, enough that I could choose to never work again.  

Someone taking 25p of every pound I earn tediously parked in front of a PC, after which I'm left with hundreds or thousands, enough for a comfortable but not luxurious life, enough to keep me afloat without working for a couple of months before needing another job.

Someone taking 12p of every pound I earnt shovelling shit, after which I can just about cover bare essentials, and would be homeless/hungry within a week of unemployment.

Honestly?  Seems like if it's justified to be ""livid"" in the first situation, it's equally or more justified in the latter.  Any time she wants to half her tax rate expressed as a percentage, she is welcome to swap places with me.  Just as I could reduce my tax rate in percentage terms by earning below / barely above the minimum allowance, but then I'd be poor as fuck, so I'd rather stay where I am thanks all the same.

I think the issue here is that she's basically gone from childhood to her current position without experiencing the other situations, so she doesn't have the perspective to check her tongue.

He did, quite a few times he (obliviously) said something completely insensitive to her, or flat out ignored her.  Now, I admit she probably should have listened to him when he sort of told her he wasn't interested when she first came on board the TARDIS, but I think if you watch Smith and Jones from Martha's perspective, you can easily see why she thought that this crazy alien might have feelings for her.  

Let's look at this  In just Smith and Jones.  He: 

* shared a romantic balcony moment with her
* held her hand a few times while running around
* kissed her
* carried her in his arms through the hospital, 
* came back and asked her to come on a trip through time, (and then another, and then another...)

Anyway, digressing, let's discount everything that happened while he was John Smith, even though John Smith treated her pretty badly a few times.

* In the Shakespeare Code there's that whole thing while laying in bed and he talks about how disappointed he is that she isn't Rose.  He also says something like ""Blimey, it's annoying training up a new one!"" when she doesn't know what the psychic paper is.
* In Gridlock he takes her to the same place he took Rose, after he lied to her about the Time Lords.  He does finally tell her the truth, when she insists.
* In the Daleks in Manhattan episodes, he begs to be killed, which, unless he's told her about Emergency Program One, would strand her in the 1930's forever.  Also he runs up to her, hugs her then says ""Never waste time in a hug!""
* In the Lazarus Experiment, he drops her off and doesn't intend to come back, and wouldn't have if it wasn't for Tish's job with Lazarus.  In a deleted scene, she asks how she looks and he ignores her and starts talking about how he found a copy of the Declaration of Independence in his tux.  Then he wants to keep her coming along for just one more trip.  Luckily she put her foot down.
* In 42 he finally started treating her better and gave her a key.  He even showed concern for her.  The only bad bit was yelling at her about Elvis and the Beatles a little.
* In Family of Blood, after all she did for John Smith and how he treated her, he says thanks by just saying thanks and giving her a hug.  I like to hope he did something nice for her after that, but we'll never know.
* In Blink, she supports him for three more months, working in a shop when she's practically a Doctor.
* In Utopia, he SCREAMS at her when she tells him about Yana's fob watch.  She was just trying to let him know and help and he freaks out at her for it.
* In the Sound of Drums he's rude to her a time or two in her apartment, Jack and the Doctor make her walk behind her all the time and barely check to see if she's there, he gets angry with her for caring about her family, they send her out for food - alone - while in the warehouse, then there's that whole ""It's like when you fancy someone and they don't even know you exist"" thing.  Then he sends her back down to Earth all alone, not even sending the immortal guy right next to her who probably has a lot of trained survival skills along to help her.
* In the Last of the Time Lords, he hugs and cries over the guy who just put the entire world, her family and herself through a year of hell right in front of her and her family.  I can see his point on this why he's so upset, but it's still pretty insensitive to all the people the Master had tortured.
* At the end, when she's giving her ""Getting out"" speech, he asks if it's going anywhere when she first starts.  

In the Sonaran episodes and the Doctor's Daughter he finally treats her well (though she is an evil clone for a lot of it.)  It's really not until then that it seems like he appreciates her.

Then he does yell at her about the Ostahargen key, when he should be grateful that it was Martha that they gave the responsibility to.  If it were anyone else, they probably would have blown the Earth up when they were supposed to.

The Doctor was definitely rude and insensitive a few times to Rose and Donna, and especially Jack, but none of them got treated like Martha did.  She's my favorite of the RTD era companions because she went through all of that and still walked away with her head held high and went on to make her life fantastic anyway.",0,1306368515,null,0,false,0,c1w1e51,t3_hjwg8,t1_c1w1e51,t1_c1w113y,1427181549,6,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,6

true,IPoopedMyPants,null,null,"Yeah... sorry for the extreme tone of my writing. I've been spending too much time in subreddits that are a lot less fun than r/doctorwho and some of my negativity seems to have spilled over into here.

It's actually a good observation, but I think I'm more interested in why the writers seem to feel the need to make the companions so monumentally important when they could simply just be companions.

Just imagine how nice it would be if they had a companion who runs into the Doctor, spends a season or two running around time and space, then gets dropped back off on Earth at the same time s/he met the Doctor and goes on living life, but with all of that new information and experience. 

Why do I need to know about Rose's mother, Martha's sister, or Donna's grandfather? A companion whose personal life is only discussed in the context of alien worlds and whose real life we never see would be fascinating. It would certainly be something that r/doctorwho and all of the other forums would be talking about.

I also wouldn't mind if the Doctor picked up a companion from a different time period. He picked up a 17th Century Scotsman, a super-genius girl from a space station in the 21st Century, and a 19th century woman. There are so many things that they did in the old Doctor Who shows that the new iteration could really benefit from. 

That said, I obviously love the new show quite a bit. Hell, Christopher Eccleston was my first Doctor. Up until about a month ago, I had only watched the new episodes. 

Now, however, I'm almost through season 12 of ye olde Doctor Who. Tom Baker is my current Doctor and I have lamented the deaths of 3 doctors. I've known 7 of them, though Tom Baker is still very new to me. There are only 4 more Doctors that I have left to meet. After I'm through with all of that, I'll only have the new episodes to look forward to.

true,bloodyfranzes,angel,Weeping Angel,"Couldn't agree more with you. I think every doctor is different and yes, a big part of that depends on who writes the character. I personally prefer 11 over 10, despite I love Tennant madly, but to be honest, I was utterly bored with all the I'm-the-last-Timelord, I-fuck-everything-up, I'm-so-sorry angst that got heavier and heavier during 10th's era.
11th is less 'human' in that sense, for want of a better word. He takes things into his stride and you can tell he's in pain or worried or feeling something, if only for 2 mere seconds, and without the never-ending over-emotional speeches. I love drama, but in sensible amounts and creative ways of displaying it! I ended up rather sad and depressed about poor 10th and was craving for the end of the 4th series and something totally different yet just as awesome.
Which is why I love Moffat so much. It's true he haven't seen much of 11th, but I think that's because we were so used to 10th's droning on and on about, um, everything? 11th's more subtle, and I've learned to pay attention to the little things. I get the sense that 11th doesn't waste words - he says the exact number of words that need to be said; everything else, he either does not want to say or just keeps it to himself 'cause he thinks events and situations will reveal themselves eventually. All that makes for solid and whole episodes. I don't know how Moffat does it, but he doesn't fail to keep me clinging on the edge of my seat every week!
TW's CoE was also a very decisive factor for my ""teaming"" with RTD. I have no words to describe how he completely ruined TW for me. You don't know how much I loved it, I should have listened to this friend of mine who had warned me not to watch CoE. I ended up so frustrated and sad. I mean, it's sci-fi for god's sake, I came up with an infinite number of ways to fix a couple of things and I'm sure RTD could have done all of them, but he just refused.

true,slotbadger,eng-yorkshire,Wakefield,"* Don't save money if you have outstanding debts. If you're paying off a credit card or a car loan, get rid of it! Don't be shovelling money into an ISA thinking that you're being smart. I know way too many people that think like this.

* If you're going to be making some big purchases in the next few months, look at cashback credit cards. You can get a Silver Amex that gives you 5% cashback for the first three months. Definitely worth it if you're buying a new boiler, sorting out car insurance for the year, etc. 

* Student loans are awesome. Keep them. Pay them off as slowly as you can. The interest rate is too low to justify trying to get rid of them. A few of my mates want them gone, but you'd actually be better off paying into a decent savings account.

* Use Quidco. ESPECIALLY if you're changing broadband/gas/phone-line/car-insurance. Can earn you a fast £50.

* Speaking of broadband, Orange have a good deal at the moment - £10 a month for unlimited, proper broadband (not mobile broadband). You don't even need to pay for a phone-line, they'll sort that. £12.50 if you actually want to make landline calls, too. You do have to be a customer, but that's easily done - just get a free sim and top it up £10. The biggest catch is that you're tied in for 18 months.

Angle one: The VAT increase is affecting everyone from small-large business owners, sole traders and manufacturers, this gets passed down to the customer. Prices rise. 

Angle two: The cuts mean people close their wallets and stop spending affecting all of the above. Maybe even losing their jobs.

Angle three: The benefits system is being reformed at a time when there is a distinct lack of jobs ( our student future workforce for one is walking into a brick wall of employment after graduating ) the cuts will add to those needing benefits. 

Angle four: The government imposes extra tax on North sea oil, the oil companies start to invest elsewhere, the cost of fuel goes up and the cost of domestic bills increases adding to the other three points above. 

Notice how food is going up, notice how utility bills are increasing at way above inflation, notice how fuel is skyrocketing and let's face it, it's never going back down again. Notice the lack of disposable income you now have and how that's being eaten into every single month. Notice how wages are completely stagnant in relation to this.

You're reading things too literally.

&gt; What exactly do you think paid for the infrastructure that allowed you to get to work every day?

Mostly bonds, as tax revenues tend not to bring in enough money so we borrow to pay for our infrastructure, which is something that's completely bat shit insane but don't get me started.

&gt; Maybe you can try living in Somalia, no one there will force you to pay taxes to contribute towards luxuries such as roads.

true,abw,cnty-uk,Surrey,"Probably very little in terms of egg quality. The reason they do it is to establish a product differentiation.  

Some people don't have much money and want to buy eggs as cheaply as possible.  Selling eggs cheaply keeps these customers satisfied.  It also allows supermarket X to claim they're as cheap as supermarket Y for the most popular basic groceries (milk, bread, eggs, etc).

On the other hand, there are people who have more disposable income and don't mind paying more for eggs.  Of course they would rather pay less money, but they won't baulk at paying slightly more.  Selling eggs at a higher price means more profit for the supermarket.

Rather than simply picking a fair price of cost + small profit, which keeps all the customers happy, the supermarket creates two different brands so that they can keep everyone happy *and* maximise their profits.  The basic range is sold as cheaply as possible to people who need to count the pennies.  The premium range is sold as expensively as possible so that those with more disposable income can feel happy that they're able to afford a better product (human psychology is such that we have a very strong association between price and perceived quality - if it costs more it surely *must* be better).

Artistic ""style"" the way it's tossed around online is bullshit.  Style doesn't mean you get to ignore the basic ground rules, styles are created by using one's understanding of anatomy to alter certain characteristics to achieve a desired effect.

Case in point, anime simplifies almost all physical characteristics of a person and emphasizes the eyes.  How large and what shape the eyes are in is used to ""mark"" a character's personality.  There are variations within the basic anime style, but it's the eyes (and perhaps lack of nose) that most people notice.

That being said, it's so over-done and tacky that only a few serious artists outside of Japan use it any longer.  Amateur anime is often the victim of a knee-jerk reaction of ""shit sucks"" or ""lazy kid,"" especially on the internet.  When you skip the anatomical background (and you don't even have to be a perfect photo-realistic artist, you just need a basic understanding of how people are put together) you end up with weird, blocky characters no one can relate to.

Too often people drawing in that style, **especially** those drawing fanart, are given asspats and undeserved praise for the lousiest of scribbles, leading them to defend themselves from any criticism with ""it's my style so I don't need to fix it.""  You don't learn from that, you don't grow from that.

------------

**EVERYTHING ABOVE THIS LINE IS MEANT IN A GENERAL WAY AND IS NOT DIRECTED TOWARDS OP'S STUDENT**

Going back to OP's student's work specifically, it's not bad.  The kid can draw a straight line and has some concept of depth (especially on the desk in the first picture), but does not have the background he needs yet.  That is why I said the teacher should encourage him to learn simple perspective and anatomy: even the most limited understanding of the two will ratchet up one's abilities a few levels and can be inspiring enough to go even further with the field.

That's assuming, of course, the kid wants to.

**TL;DR** Anatomy and perspective are important regardless of the ""style"" you're going for and the kid has a lot of potential.  Also, deviantART has made me bitter towards anime kids.

Not intentionally. But I can see how it appears and you may be right. The heart of it is that prejudice is informed from experience. Not that a few bad experiences excuses racism (I get utterly livid with our American compatriots on reddit when they yammer on about all the black people shouting in the cinema and not tipping or looking when they cross the road or whatever the fuck today's stereotype is); but it does go a way towards explaining some things. 

&gt;More important than employment in racism is social divide; people form sub-communities which simply don't mix with each other, and that lack of integration ferments crass stereotypes and racial prejudice.

I just don't see the lack of integration being so keenly felt in places where there isn't as much cause to complain. There is a reason the BNP targets poorer communities. Integration itself is an unwieldy subject to get into; it's complicated and insidious and it may well be the root cause of racism in Britain.

He manages to steal some power from the Eye of Harmony under the Panopticon, and survives to fight another day, but still does not regenerate.  ](/spoiler)

[He the reappears in ""The Keeper of Traken"", where he manages to usurp the power of the Source of Traken.

He escapes from Traken in this new, hybrid body, played by Anthony Ainley.](/spoiler)

[In The Five Doctors, the Master is promised ""a new regeneration cycle"" by the Timelords if he performs a task for them.  The Timelords might be lying.  The point of the story is Borusa (Time Lord President) is trying to extend his own life beyond his final regeneration, and only being able to do this using the Game of Rassilon, so it seems unlikely that the Time Lords can actually do this.](/spoiler)

[In the 9th Doctor stories, the Master does refer to having been 'resurrected by the Time Lords to fight in the Time War as their ultimate warrior'.  Its not clear from context if they used time travel to achieve this, or some form of regenerative technology.  However, when shot in the distant future, he successfully regenerates within the confines of the Tardis.](/spoiler)

[In The End of Time, the Master's human followers manage to again resurrect his cremated body using instructions that he left behind (possibly using the same method the Time Lords used to resurrect him previously).](/spoiler)

true,Matriss,tardis,TARDIS,"I know exactly what you mean, it *does* seem like a lot of bother at first, even for people drawing ""just for fun.""  But the bother is **so** worth it.  Forms and perspective are both very, *very* important.  Let me give you a personal example.

I drew [this](http://fc07.deviantart.net/fs20/f/2007/294/0/5/Bow_and_Arrow_by_Matriss.jpg) about four years ago.  I had some rudimentary grasp of perspective and foreshortening, but overall it's not very good.  Around that time I was really frustrated with how I drew, even though I was just doing it for fun, and I really buckled down to start to learn anatomy.

[This](http://fc08.deviantart.net/fs70/i/2011/126/5/d/finished_comic_panel_by_matriss-d3frb78.png) is something I drew about two weeks ago.  I'm *nowhere near* a professional level, and there's about a million things wrong with it (like the hands, holy hell they came out bad), but you can see a marked improvement.

""Anatomy"" does mean bone and muscle structure, and can be very, *very* daunting, but it helps to break it down into simple steps.  Start with figuring how how large each body part is in relation to the other and the basic shapes for each part and how they connect, then move down into the specifics of muscle/bone (at least that's what I've done).  Beyond that, it's observation.

Well, when Amy remembered the Doctor back into existence, it was as if he was never erased at all.  As things stand now, everyone remembers him and it's normal.

If you looked in on his old companions after he was erased but before Amy brought him back, they wouldn't remember him, but they would still have the same lives.  Amy didn't disappear when her parents were erased.  Even though they never existed at all, their child remains.  (The Doctor says something about people leaving traces in one of the episodes.)

Basically, if you are erased from the universe, all of the cause and effect things that happened because of your existence still happened, but nobody remembers you.  Rose would still be trapped in an alternate universe, she just wouldn't remember how she got there.  Like Amy, her life wouldn't make sense.

* The 20 folk the DPP urged to appeal their sentence had already [been prosecuted for conspiracy and/or aggravated tresspass](http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2011/jan/09/undercover-office-green-activists).

* October/November 2010 Mr Kennedy is confronted in Nottingham by fellow campaigners and [confesses to being a police officer](http://www.thisisnottingham.co.uk/news/Mark-Kennedy-timeline/article-3111472-detail/article.html).

* It wasn't until lawyers ""submitted their demand for material about Kennedy's role last Monday (03/01/2011)"" [that the CPS dropped the cases against the defendents](http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2011/jan/16/mark-kennedy-living-nightmare-trial-collapse).

&gt; In a statement, the CPS said: ""Previously unavailable information that significantly undermined the prosecution's case came to light on Wednesday 5 January 2011. In light of this information, the Crown Prosecution Service reviewed the case and decided there was no longer sufficient evidence for a realistic prospect of conviction.""

Mr Kennedy stated;

&gt; The former officer said that he made undercover audio recordings of the activists which threw doubt on prosecutors' claims they had conspired to commit aggravated trespass, but that his police superiors chose not to pass these on.

&gt; He said: ""The truth of the matter is that the tapes clearly show that the six defendants who were due to go on trial had not joined any conspiracy. The tapes I made meant that the police couldn't prove their case. I have no idea why the police withheld these tapes.""
