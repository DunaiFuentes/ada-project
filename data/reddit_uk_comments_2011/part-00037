I hope Scotland stays part of the UK and continues to contribute to the RAF, and indeed all the armed forces, and if in the meanwhile it makes strategic sense to keep skeleton bases in Scotland whilst they're still part of the Union then so be it - the UK should take advantage whilst they can (but then if these bases being discussed covered that Salmond would hardly be having to make a case).

Why does this shit always happen to us. We are fucking *going places* but our top players keep forgetting about the loyalty being returned.

Let's be realistic. He has to go. We cannot keep an unhappy player. He won't play the football at the level he was.

If all they ever did was call someone's mobile phone number and press the appropriate number they were invited to press or knew to press in order to access the voicemail system, and the people they called were all corrupt officials then no one would care. 

If all they did was also call rich celebrities' voicemail then most people wouldn't care either. 

The only point that the public really cares is when victims' voicemails were listened to, for obvious reasons. But once the public cares because victims' voicemails were listened to why should they then backtrack and also care about the journalists that *weren't* listening to victim's voicemails but were only listening to corrupt officials. 

And that's always the case with any scandal. Everyone does something that most people don't care too much about and that they would never be taken to court or sacked over. Then one person or a small group of people take it too far and do something that nearly everyone agrees is wrong. Then all of a sudden the other things no one cared or would care about also become really bad *in the context* of public outrage about the very few things that crossed the line. From his point of view that's unfair or hypocritical or illogical in some sense.

&gt;ISLAMIC law has been officially adopted in Britain, with sharia courts given powers to rule on Muslim civil cases.

&gt;The government has quietly sanctioned the powers for sharia judges to rule on cases ranging from divorce and financial disputes to those involving domestic violence.

&gt;Rulings issued by a network of five sharia courts are enforceable with the full power of the judicial system, through the county courts or High Court.

&gt;Previously, the rulings of sharia courts in Britain could not be enforced, and depended on voluntary compliance among Muslims.

&gt;It has now emerged that sharia courts with these powers have been set up in London, Birmingham, Bradford and Manchester with the network’s headquarters in Nuneaton, Warwickshire. Two more courts are being planned for Glasgow and Edinburgh.

Someone called Millstreet asks:

&gt; From the introduction:  ""after the Royal Air Force hit Berlin with retaliatory strikes in September,..."" While the present gallery is entitled ""Battle of Britain, this clause appears to link RAF bomber action over Berlin as part of that battle. Has photographic evidence survived showing the damage inflicted by RAF raid during this time period?

And the compiler of the gallery responds:
	
&gt; Thanks for the question Millstreet. I spent a good deal of time looking for available photos of such damage (to German cities, inflicted by RAF bombers in 1940). I found hundreds of images of bombing damage to Berlin, but none that specified 1940. The city was bombed many times through the course of the war.

You break the speed limit, you've thrown litter on the floor, you've probably tresspassed, stolen a traffic cone, or done other things that are technically illegal but within a certain context aren't regarded as particularly problematic and so are either ignored or regarded as illegal but not on a par with other things that are also illegal. So the argument ""illegal is illegal"" isn't something that people *really* believe (especially when it comes to something like their own speeding or their own actions that are illegal). They certainly do believe it when they're talking about something like this, after the fact, but they're inconsistent in their belief when talking about other things that they don't regard as serious. 

And public reaction does matter when it comes to the law. That probably shouldn't be the case but it is. As I said, if (literally) the only people whose voicemails were ever listened to was corrupt officials who were then exposed in the media as a result then the public just wouldn't care and when there was political pressure to do something about it there wouldn't be any prosecutions (and if there were the public would react against it because it would be seen as officials trying to prosecute journalists for exposing other corrupt officials)

&gt; If this was investigated properly at the start, even when ""nobody cared"" somebody would have gone to prison. In fact people did before the hacking of Milly Dowler and war heroes was revealed.

I think that's actually a demonstration of my point, really. The fact that the effort to get this reinvestigated wasn't getting a lot of traction demonstrates that how outraged the public is *does* matter. People got prosecuted the first time because the royals were involved, because the public has sympathy for them. And people are about to get prosecuted again because victims are involved, because that's something the public has sympathy for. If all they were doing was listening to the voicemails of corrupt officials and reporting those corruptions in the paper then I don't think they would have been prosecuted. 

So from that line of reasoning (which is essentially what his reasoning is; the slippery slope argument where the slope got too slippery) he does have a point.

OK, if you want to look at it from that point of view I can easily bend to accomodate you and still demonstrate the original point. People sometimes believe it's *OK* to break laws and at other times they believe it's not OK. So backtracking to your original point *""Illegal is illegal, no matter how outraged the public gets""*: illegal *is* indeed illegal but people believe it's sometimes OK to break a law and sometimes it's not OK; that is the way that most people behave and their behaviour follows from their beliefs. The example of speeding is the one I used as people know it's illegal but they often think it's OK to break the law; they feel they are justified under certain conditions (they need to get somewhere in a hurry on this one exceptional occasions, it isn't hurting anyone, they can drive safely etc.). The point I was reflecting, which McMullan was making was that maybe illegal is illegal but people believe it's OK to break laws sometimes. For example they may think it's OK to listen to voicemails when it's corrupt officials but they may not think it's OK when listening to victims' voicemails. To put it another way, as I did in the previous comment, there are things that *""are technically illegal but within a certain context aren't regarded as particularly problematic and so are either ignored or regarded as illegal but not on a par with other things that are also illegal""*

Do you believe that if the royals weren't involved and if victims weren't involved and if the public wasn't interested then the investigation would be producing prosecutions and scandals?

&gt; that is what has led to the present scandal

That led to the current scandal *because* of the victims involved though, surely? Celebrities taking pay offs to not prosecute and to keep their cases confidential and thereby prevent the public from knowing the extent of the problem could have carried on indefinitely and there would be no scandal.

Yes, because the CPS, that institutions far removed from public opinion (they may rattle and bend to it sometimes, but you'll find most of their most petty prosecutions and decisions fly in the face of popular consensus) demanded the review of the investigation by the police, who were happy to be done with the whole affair, due to people bringing suits against the NotW.

Did you read my link? Look again at January and February...this is months before the victims that would enrage the public, but the police had started to pick up their investigation and inform the victims...months later one of those victims is found to be Milly Dowler. What you're saying only makes sense if the police and CPS only stared to ramp up their investigations (investigations they were happy to abandon at the end of 2010) on July 4th rather than right at the start of the year due to Sienna Miller. Yes, she took a pay-off, but you're crazy if you thing George Galloway would ever pass up an opportunity to set the cat amongst the pigeons.

For your reading of the situation and therefore McMullen's to fit you have to somehow ignore all the other things going on and take a narrow week long view of everything.

Luckily that wasn't the [point of the comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/ilkk7/former_notw_executive_recounts_phone_hacking/c24rzfh). The point of the comment was that

*I do understand what he's saying, from his perspective*

*The only point that the public really cares is when victims' voicemails were listened to, for obvious reasons. But once the public cares because victims' voicemails were listened to why should they then backtrack and also care about the journalists that weren't listening to victim's voicemails but were only listening to corrupt officials.*

*And that's always the case with any scandal. Everyone does something that most people don't care too much about and that they would never be taken to court or sacked over. Then one person or a small group of people take it too far and do something that nearly everyone agrees is wrong. Then all of a sudden the other things no one cared or would care about also become really bad in the context of public outrage about the very few things that crossed the line. From his point of view that's unfair or hypocritical or illogical in some sense.*

Your point seems to be about whether this was investigated properly or not, rather than whether the public cares or not and under which circumstances they care and under which circumstances a scandal is or isn't produced etc.

Yes, the Doctor loves humans.  Do you know any dog people or cat people?  They love those animals, but do you seriously believe those animal lovers are actually screwing those animals?  The Doctor loves traveling with people, taking them to interesting places, and seeing the fun they have.  He feels lonely when he doesn't have companions to share things with.  Basically, he's exactly like a widower who lives with dogs or cats and thinks of them as his friends and equals.

No insult to my motherland intended, I just think that's the nature of the beast and probably applies regardless of where you've left and are returning too.

My general experiences of return after a five year absence were of people feigning interest in your exploits and experiences abroad but quickly losing interest in a completely alien narrative, the houses being so so so small - I can understand why Americans think of trips to the UK as a bit like visiting miniature world or something, it feels weird enough coming back from Asia.  On the plus side, it was great being able to walk around freely in the countryside without the nagging fear that at some point you're going to step on a mine and without every square inch being put to some sort of productive use, and to walk into real pubs for a change rather than someone's half arsed attempt to ""recreate"" one (albeit, the draconian smoking laws have somewhat destroyed the pub atmosphere - though I appreciate many wouldn't agree).

I just finished at Loughborough and I've had a great time, but I do think I missed some aspects that city universities have like a good night-life, selection of cinemas etc. You're not far from Nottingham/Leicester so it doesn't make too much difference for big events but the lifestyle is certainly different.

The town itself is not fantastic (I really would not want to live here in the long term) but when you're in halls that doesn't matter as the student community is very closely tied so you'll have plenty of fun on nights out, if that's your thing. The student union is really quite fun, and there is always stuff going on; every year there is a student music festival ""freefest"" which is really awesome, they dialled it down a bit this year for budget reasons though.

Freshers year can be amazing for some, I didn't really enjoy the ""Hall"" social theme but others find it fantastic; the freshers week is normally really well organised but some of the hall 'jock' male returners are complete dicks and aren't really there to help out and guide you as much as to try and fuck 18/19 year old girls. This is to be expected at any uni though, I guess.

I can't comment on the teaching quality for other departments, but the computer science faculty are excellent, I'm very happy with what I have learnt.

Let's look at what Boris said, that the police had drawn a line under it and the investigation was to go no further.   Well the police did, so what is Boris or any other politician to say?  They go to the police and say this needs to be looked at, the police go away come back and say that the matter is closed.  That's all Boris said, and could say as a politician.

Some good journalists then did some good journalism and discovered there might be a little more to the story.  They blow it open, the police concede they have to go back and investigate again on new evidence, and so politicians like Boris say things like 'We must get to the bottom of this'.

Then Boris is asked by a reporter if he regrets saying the matter was settled months ago - well he was only repeating what the police had told him.  If the police tell him there's no evidence then he can only go on that.  However he's caught by a journalist cold and asked about something he said a year ago and whether he regrets it.  I dare say given time to compose himself and to put the question in context, to remember what he actually said and why, he'd have done what other politicians have already said; 'we got it wrong because we got some bad advice.  We should get to the bottom of this.'  Getting to the bottom of it means investigating all those involved in illegal activity.  A politician asking for everyone complicit to be investigated is not a bad thing.

Is there any evidence to suggest Boris knew the News of the World were bribing the police?  No.  Is there any reason to suspect Boris knew the extent of the tapping?  No.  In fact, Boris is the one person that had more reason to detest the News of the World than anyone else.  They'd done a hit job on both him and one of his best friends from university; Darius Guppy.  In short, although they'd been told to support the Conservatives instead of Labour in 2010 Boris didn't have any friends at the News of the World and one mayor or politician wasn't going to change which way Murdoch pointed his guns. 

So no, Boris didn't have to lie, he should have just admitted that he was wrong in repeating the police when they said they didn't think there was more to this story - not that he could have had any reason to doubt them and voiced it without getting himself a law suit.

Moreover this whole angsty, 'the whole political elite' and 'down with everyone' is becoming juvenile and reminiscent of the level of debate people have come to expect over US politics.  ",0,1310387342,null,0,true,0,c24wi5q,t3_ilk1i,t1_c24wi5q,t1_c24wcf8,1427336775,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt;LAST week the News of the World was the subject of some ferocious and, at times, hysterical attacks on its credibility, integrity and journalistic standards.
&gt;
&gt;The onslaught was led by a series of reports in the Guardian newspaper and hastily followed by the BBC, Sky News, and ITN.
&gt;
&gt;The essence of their campaign was that members of our staff have engaged in a widespread and unlawful conspiracy to access ""thousands"" of mobile phones.
&gt;
&gt;However, as Andy Hayman - a former Assistant Commissioner at Scotland Yard, who headed an exhaustive nine-month inquiry into our journalistic conduct - says today: ""My recollection is different.""
&gt;
&gt;He adds: ""As I recall the list of those targeted, which was put together from records kept by Glen Mulcaire, ran to several hundred names.
&gt;
&gt;""Of these,"" writes Hayman, ""there was a small number - perhaps a handful - where there was evidence that the phones had actually been tampered with.""
&gt;
&gt;And of claims that the former Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott was a victim of hacking, Hayman declares they are ""without any clear evidence"".
&gt;
&gt;Despite purporting to represent the highest standards in journalism, the Guardian's reporting was inaccurate, selective and purposely misleading.
&gt;
&gt;It is a fact that one former News of the World journa- list - Clive Goodman, the Royal Editor - tapped into telephone voicemails.
&gt;
&gt;A private investigator, Glen Mulcaire, contracted to the paper, did the same.
&gt;
&gt;That happened in 2006. Both men went to prison. Goodman was subsequently dismissed and the editor at the time, Andy Coulson - now David Cameron's Press chief - honourably resigned.
&gt;
&gt;As a result of these actions, this newspaper, in April last year, resolved a legal case brought against us by Gordon Taylor, chief executive of the Professional Footballers' Association, after it was discovered that his voicemail had been illegally hacked into by Mulcaire.
&gt;
&gt;On Thursday, Assistant Commissioner John Yates, one of Scotland Yard's most experienced detectives, confirmed that the police would not be reopening their inquiry into the affair - because no new evidence had come to light.
&gt;Forged
&gt;
&gt;So let us be clear. Neither the police, nor our own internal investigations, has found any evidence to support allegations that News of the World journalists have accessed voicemails of any individuals.
&gt;
&gt;Nor instructed private investigators or other third parties to access voicemails of any individual.
&gt;
&gt;Nor found that there was any systemic corporate illegality by any executive to suppress evidence to the contrary.
&gt;
&gt;If the police, or ourselves, had uncovered such evidence, charges would have been brought.
&gt;
&gt;The Guardian slyly linked a separate investigation by the Information Commissioner to allegations of phone tapping.
&gt;
&gt;That report, which named almost all national news- papers and covered activities as far back as 2001, referred to 23 journalists from the News of the World and The Sun.
&gt;
&gt;Along with banks and government agencies, they had received confidential information through a private investigator which, the Commissioner deemed, breached the Data Protection Act.
&gt;
&gt;The News of the World has a long and distinguished tradition. But we also accept that there have been times in our 165-year history when, like the rest of the media, we have made mistakes.
&gt;
&gt;When we have done so, we have admitted to them.
&gt;
&gt;No newspaper, least of all the Guardian, is perfect. Nor is our craft a perfect science.
&gt;
&gt;Its practitioners are human. They misbehave and make mistakes for which they - rightly - pay a heavy price.
&gt;
&gt;So let us remember that it was the Guardian that knowingly, deliberately and illegally forged a cabinet minister's signature to get an exclusive story.
&gt;
&gt;It was the Guardian that cynically abandoned one of journalism's most fundamental and sacred covenants by revealing the identity of a confidential informant.
&gt;
&gt;As a result of that betrayal, a Foreign Office civil servant - a 23-year-old woman - was sent to prison.
&gt;
&gt;So, if the Guardian has any fresh evidence to support their claims against us, we invite them to pass it on to the police without delay.
&gt;
&gt;Yesterday, in their editorial column, they proclaimed: ""Decent journalism has never been more necessary . . . ""
&gt;
&gt;We couldn't agree more. It's time they practised what they preach.

11:39am Miliband demands not only that Murdoch be arrested, but also that the right to a fair trial be waved. ""Murdoch should be thrown in jail for a very long time"", he said. 

11:43am Clegg countered by demanding that Murdoch should be caught and hung by the neck until dead.  He called upon the people of Britain to rise up and form a lynch mob to deal with ""this pestilence of our age"".

11.49am Miliband responded saying that he would settle for nothing less than Murdoch being hung, drawn and quartered. ""It's all or nothing, this time"".

11.53am Clegg implied that Miliband's mother was little more than a common street whore who had brought up a child incapable of dealing with a situation in a firm, but fair manor.  Unless, he continued, Miliband was prepared to hang, draw, quarter and skullfuck Murdoch personally, then he was a ""useless bag of piss who should give up politics and go back to the boy scouts"".

Being one year older, Meireles has more risk in terms of injuries. 

I guess my point is that both Meireles and Aquilani will be transitional players for Liverpool. If Meireles gets good interest, it will do Liverpool good to sell him now with proper value than letting him go for free in 2 or 3 years time. It seems like Aquilani isn't getting as much interest, so we might as well try to capitalise on the fact that he is staying, and hope that he can raise our game, and his value at the same time.

Ramires is the only box to box midfielder we have left - Lampard operates in a freer role. I think we need two new midfielders - one to compete with Ramires, and another to compete with Mikel.

De Rossi would be good as a holding midfield, and from what I hear, so might Moutinho of Porto, and Rodwell of Everton. All deep-lying playmakers (Rodwell might only be defensive midfield, but he has been used further up the pitch this past season), but I think De Rossi adds a little more experience, pedigree and defensive fortitude. 

As for a short-term replacement for Essien (I believe Ramires will grow into the long-term replacement but we need someone new to come in for now), maybe Palacious, Schweinsteiger, maybe Hitzlsperger? These are tough to come by. Sissoko and Parker could both work.

The most obvious thing that springs to mind is when everyone loving the Dobby Doctor made him strong again but to be honest most of the season finales that RTD wrote have really weak endings. The Tardis giving Rose Godlike powers so she could eliminate the Daleks was really thin as well. Compare RTD's endings with Moffats. Blink I've already mentioned but tell me who wasn't satisfied with the ending of The Doctor Dances? They set up the idea of nanobots and then at the conclusion The Doctor manages to save the day with  simple idea that was well explained and in keeping with everything that went before. Any ending that requires someone making up  science while standing in front of a computer is a weak ending, Children of Earth is a perfect example. 

As I've said, at it's best Dr Who is outstanding family science fiction that introduces a threat and then manages to conquer it without having to drop an ill-explained ending from the sky in the last few minutes. Moffat and others have shown this can be done while also providing humour, character development and drama. RTD cared more about the drama than the science fiction.

I think Desmond is full of shit. He's *not even close* to being in the same league as Murdoch. He's enough of a businessman to know the importance of market confidence if you're trying to raise funds - but does *anyone* really believe him when he says he's got £1bn in his pocket!? 

If you do, by the way, I've got a bridge for sale, and because I like your face I'll throw in the Tower of London.

This is a man who runs a couple of tawdry tabloids and a celebrity wank  magazine on a shoestring budget. Please don't think I'm an admirer of Murdoch - like many people here I've been boycotting his papers &amp; other media for years without being told to - but if we're comparing businessmen, Murdoch vs. Desmond is like putting a racehorse next to a seaside donkey. A wheezy old one with piss running down its leg.

Murdoch has massive collateral, and the proven ability to build and run a successful worldwide media empire over decades, bringing with it vast political influence. 

Desmond has the Daily Express(!), the Star (=Viz Daily, only without the wit) and OK (or is it the other one? no matter).

*If* any of the News International titles are going to be sold, I suspect the only look in Desmond will get will be a friendly welcome to the table, so that he can bump up the price for the real buyers. 

But what do I know about it? Fuck all. Like most of us, I think. On the basis of a small amount of questionable information I will form opinions that I take very seriously. A fitting tribute to the role of the tabloid in our society!

*The Guardian* is really no different from the other publishers in regards to their role in society and reliance on the corporate world. They are created to shape opinion and ultimately enforce the status quo. Consider them the Democrats of the journalistic world to the obviously malevolent Republicans.

If you really want to support journalism go independent. I don't know what the UK has in answer to endeavours such as DemocracyNow or Glenn Greenwald who are closer to being of the people, by the people. Hell, I'd rather people donate to Wikileaks than buy *The Guardian* (a company who has offered no financial or legal support to their once source).

As for the BBC, they are well in the pocket of the 'empire'. Watch something like John Pillager's *The War You Don't See*, listen to Rageh Omaar's account and understand the phoney reporting regarding the staged fall of Saddam's statue. Of course there was the BBC's cheerleading for every recent war, and don't forgot they never discussed whether we needed cuts, we skipped that part of the debate with the topic being immediately framed as what will be cut.",0,1310430988,null,0,true,0,c25172a,t3_imoft,t1_c25172a,t3_imoft,1427339047,5,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,5

He likens creationism to government regulation and a fully unregulated market to the wonder of Darwinian Evolution. In other words he's a believer in Social Darwinism.

An excerpt:

&gt; Creationism penalises the poorest in our society with regressive taxes and policies – like the licence fee and digital switchover;

&gt; It promotes inefficient infrastructure in the shape of digital terrestrial television;

&gt; It creates unaccountable institutions - like the BBC Trust, Channel 4 and Ofcom;

&gt; And now, in the all-media marketplace, it threatens significant damage to important spheres of human enterprise and endeavour - the provision of independent news, investment in professional journalism, and the innovation and growth of the creative industries.

&gt; We are on the wrong path - but we can find the right one.

&gt; The right path is all about trusting and empowering consumers. It is about embracing private enterprise and profit as a driver of investment, innovation and independence.

The Guardian is a pile of wank, aimed at a certain sort of champagne socialist. I nearly punched my computerthe other day when they ran an article about how the tories have made loads of people homeless and it literally said something along the lines of ""and this is terrible news, because instead of people being homeless because of drugs problems, now this means middle class people will be homeless.""

Which actually ignores the fact that most homeless people are normal people who have fallen on hard times, heavy drug use usually comes as a result of being homeless, not as a cause. And the entire article was attempting to blame the tories for the fact that there aren't enough council houses to go around, even though the issue of a lack of social housing has been around for decades, &amp; no party seems concerned with fixing it.

It's not the problem, I should clarify, that they are criticising the Tories per se, but as somebody who was homeless with my mother &amp; sister when I  was 13 just for a month or so in 2003 I find it really fucking horrible for a newspaper to only give a shit about the huge issue that effects thousands every day when it furthers their political agenda. To run an article about social housing shortages making people homeless and attributing it to one government, who have been there for a year or so really belittles a very important issue that we as a society have been getting wrong since about 1970. Such polemic proliferation of partisan political views only serves to cloud the debate on the issue, so it no longer clearly is about discussing providing better care for people, but becomes a shouting match between people who describe themselves as left wing (note: not necessarily left wing), and people who describe themselves as right wing (note: not necessarily right wing)

Basically. the Guardian only runs articles about travesties of justice in society when the Tories are involved. To the Guardian, attacking the tories &gt; pointing out areas which need progressive thought. For example, they didn't criticise Labour for taking a government run corporation that invested in poorer commonwealth nations to build farms, roads, &amp; such like, and then privatising it under a man who only ever worked as a hedge fund manager (which predictably turned out badly).
But the Guardian did complain when the Tories decided to privatise the forests. Well, some of the forests, being as 80% of heavily forested land in the UK is already privately owned.
You see, one of them is a bigger deal, but only one got reported.

No and I think you are selectively quoting him, missing out the part
&gt;He added: ""Vast numbers of Muslims feel disengaged and alienated from mainstream British society.""
 
Khan's alarm seems to be about the disengagement and alienation of British Muslims. This alienation I would contend is actively fostered by the right-wing press and fascist groups like the EDL.

&gt;It concludes that the bias has extended across drama, comedy and entertainment, with the corporation pandering to politically motivated celebrities and trendy causes.

If councils could build houses then the housing market would return towards ""at cost"" prices. It is government policy that house prices are paramount. Two things would help society:

1. Making it easier to build more houses.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt;**An embarrassing and excruciating attempt to evade, defelect and to lie his way out of what he originally said.** 

This is what's sad about the commentary; people complain about a lack of honesty in the press or but they lack it themselves.  It's all about anything to hurl  or pin the other guy down.   

It wasn't that embarrassing or excruciating, not unless you're overly sensitive; he was caught blindsided by a quote from over a year a go and put on the spot.   As I said, there'd have been nothing wrong with him saying that he was wrong.  He could even have said he doesn't regret the comments because at the time that is what the police were saying.

&gt;**And you have the audacity to promote the level of political debate in the UK to be superoir to that of the US after listening to the gibberish of the bumbling idiot, that is Boris Johnson!?**

Oh it's infinitely superior. They have nothing like Lord Mayor's Questions but it's easy to dismiss candidates as career politicians and bumbling idiots.  Boris bumbles and he certainly has a waffling style about his manner but you don't become editor of the Spectator with a golden handshake, nor the assistant editor of the Telegraph.  In his own right he's an eminent historian.  

Beyond the position of Mayor of London the UK system has created a far more informed electorate and culture which tends to lead to a more mature debate than that found on average in the US.  Easily.  Many Americans would admit that they envy the UK's Prime Minister's Questions and openly rely on the BBC and the Guardian to fill in much of their gaps...and the UK has even more to offer.

It's not audacity.  It's honesty and fact.

&gt;**What the whole phone hacking scandal reveals is that political debate in the UK is centred around the intrests, perspectives and support of News International and the right wing media.**

Which leads to me suspect you're either young and sensationalist-pliant or not from the UK.  Tony Blair's last recognised address of issue before leaving Downing Street?  The person the Conservatives originally put in charge of the BSkyB inquiry?  The nature of ownership of the BBC and Channel 4 corporations?

Parties may have courted News International to help them get elected but that's always been known.  What the phone hacking has shown is the widespread illegality and corruption in News of the World and questioned their influence, but it's been outed by a somewhat healthy alternative outlook media and politicians.  As for some of the most prominent politicians, they've been actively targeted by the News of the World on both sides of the aisle.

You can't argue that Boris Johnson is lying to protect News of the World.  They have a long history of feud.  He's always worked as a journalist for their competitors, they ran attack-articles on him and his friends and he has the biggest mandate of any UK politician with over a million votes.  He has his old magazine and his column in the Telegraph to pull on.  He's also a TV personality in his own right.  If there's one politician that is free from reliance of the News of the World it's Boris.

&gt;**The fundamental question this raises is, who really runs the country?**

It's sure as hell not Murdoch, isn't it!  Look around.  Put your head out of the window and stop hyping.

&gt;**'The truth is, we have all been in this together—the press, politicians and leaders of all parties—and yes, that includes me.'**

Yes, that shows how press, politicians and leaders of all parties have used News International to win votes.  Of course politicians courted the support of The Sun, The Times, The News of the World.  You'd have been a fool not to; but that doesn't imply ''the whole phone hacking scandal has demonstrated how the whole political elite is in kowtow to Murdoch and the extreme right wing press"".

Many of the political elite also hated Murdoch and had been attacked by his papers, it doesn't mean they were kowtowed or in the grips of the 'extreme right press'.  Even the Conservatives appointed Vince Cable as business secretary.   If there's one country in the Western English speaking world which has now demonstratively shown that not to be the case it's the UK where Murdoch is getting a kicking and where much of the media is set up by either trust or public corporation.
  
Cable, Secretary of State for Business, Innovation and Skills, might have scored an own goal but his comment,   

         ""I have declared war on Mr Murdoch and I think 
                     we are going to win"" 

last December is starting to look prophetic.

&gt;**You may wish to classify the British Prime Minister as 'juvenile', I can probably think of stronger words.** 

I don't think he is, you're taking what he said out of context, I think you are, and, yes, I'm sure *you* can think of stronger words to hype this up.

&gt; **While I despair at the level of political debate in the US, I think you are more than a little deluded to think the quality of political debate is any better in the UK.**

It's much, much better I just don't think you've looked for it.  There's no way the UK could field candidates for prominent positions of the calibre the US fields and get away with it.  

&gt;**after all we do have Boris Johnson as mayor of London...'in kowtow to Murdoch and the extreme right wing press'**

There it is again.  You're asserting and sensationalising something which isn't there.

&gt;**no different from the US.**

Plenty of difference because even Rupert Murdoch knows he couldn't get away on Sky with what he gets away with on Fox, and despite his considerable over exposure in the US over the UK which country is he panicking most about now?  The UK.

Where do many in the US go to for their news?

The BBC.

However, the self deprecation has to be believable. A 10/10 blonde bombshell going on stage and trying to be self deprecating isn't going to go well at all.

I have no problem about characters keeping secrets about their pasts but there's a big difference between keeping secrets like River (""I can't tell you, timeline, blah blah blah"") or lying like the Doctor (""It's obvious I'm not telling the truth but you will come to find that it was for the greater good"") and behaving the way Ianto does.

Jack has a number of secrets, some of which are downright awful (see: CoE) but doesn't come off as as much of a creep as Ianto does IMO, largely because most of his secrets are kept for the benefit of others (emphasis on ""most of"").

true,herofix,scottish,The Garioch,"I once wrote to Johann Hari; it was in the run up to the 2008 American election.

I was angry that an article he'd written on John McCain had attacked him for being the son of an admiral (among many other things, including some of his positions, but it was the implication that being the son of an admiral was a telling indication of his unsuitability that had rankled me).

I was a feverish Obama supporter, and as an American living abroad I saw in his campaign a real chance to reflect to the world outside of the US a better image of me and where I'd come from.  But a big part of that was the promise, that still seemed possibly achievable at the time, that Barack Obama would be able to impart a civilising influence on the fractured national discourse.  It was because of this that I wanted to 'correct' those who would likely support Obama when they wanted to denigrate McCain.  I wanted the civility to overpower the type of thing that Jon Stewart had so famously taken Hannity to task for in that famous interview.

So I wrote to Johann Hari about this, and in the course of the e-mail I used the word 'mendacious'.  But it was my own ignorance, because before my ignorance was shown up, I had thought from context that 'mendacious' meant 'mean-spirited' or something close to that.  But of course, it means 'untruthful on purpose', I was to find out.  So he quickly wrote back to me personally and was quite forceful in asserting that his integrity and his truth-telling were not to be called into question.  I realised my error and wrote back to apologise, and this time explained my reasoning for wanting the coverage of the race to stay away from ugliness.  He wrote back a second time, and was very gracious.  By the third e-mail exchange we were talking about LOST (he fancied Sawyer), and in the final exchange I told him that it felt weird to be writing back and forth to a person who wrote for a national newspaper because I'm just some geezer with no qualifications who worked (at the time) as a milkman and was sitting in a garden shed where I kept my laptop.  He wrote back to say that I shouldn't denigrate myself and that a milkman is just as important as anyone else.

So all that to say, he seems likes a good bloke.  I think he meant well, but it seems stupid to be lifting things that other people have written and bet that you won't get caught.  I'd imagine you'd get caught every time.  I would bet a lot of money he'll never do it again, especially considering how much it seemed to mean to him when his integrity was questioned by me.

I agree, but essentially the Murdoch empire had been eating its own in this sense; they both courted and attacked those in power.  It was there in their own epitaph front page.  It is there in those that helped in bringing it to light.

River is clever and strong and capable; whereas, Rose was USUALLY helpless, needed to be saved, and was selfish throughout the majority of season 1. That's why I prefer River as a love interest to the Doctor rather than Rose.

Also, the way that their timelines intersect makes things interesting. There's no way that the Doctor can't be intrigued by her. AND~ at this point, they've revealed that [the Doctor and River have something in common that he doesn't have in common with anyone else in the world: that she's part Time Lord. And so... she can read Gallifreyan, she can fly the Tardis, and she can feel the pain of regeneration. She can know and understand him in a way that no other companion could; for these reasons, she has the same rules and values as him.](/spoiler) That brings her above and beyond the capabilities of other companions, and those aren't things that could be done ""by a generic soldier with a gun.""

I see River, on the other hand, as a gun and hardly more. If it weren't for the out-of-order meeting, she'd be less interesting than watching paint dry. And what happened to the Doctor hating guns? She's exactly the sort of person he wouldn't like at all normally, but it seems like recently his dislike of killing has been set aside, so maybe that's not true anymore.

Edit: [Being part time lord doesn't mean much. She can only fly the TARDIS because the Doctor taught her, that doesn't make her unique; he could teach that to anyone.

Whether this comes from being around children all the time (a noble profession) or from the issues that your still dealing with from your distant and recent past (for which you have my sympathies) I'm not sure. 

The point is that discussion involves the sharing of ideas. It involves listening to ideas put forward by the other person and then responding in kind. Simply repeating a phrase and not acknowledging the other person's response is a childish way to behave. 

I've trained as a secondary teacher and worked in that field for 15 years. My job is to help people become young adults and behave in an adult manner. When I see people behaving like children I call them out on it and tell them how to act as adults. 

Your profession, as I've said, is a noble one but assuming that everyone is ""acting up"" will get you into trouble if it hasn't already. You can't apply the tactics you will use in your future employment in adult situations because while adults can ""act up"" they can also use wit to prove a point.

true,[deleted],null,null,"Well their banking is pretty good.  Free checking, free bill pay, interest on your checking, cash rewards debit card, free atm withdrawals (they refund the fees), and the web banking is superb (along with their mobile app).  You also get free checks and deposit slips mailed to you. The deposit slips contain postage-free envelopes so you can mail the deposit in (checks/mo only, no cash -- one downfall is no easy way to deposit cash, but it hasn't really bothered me in 5 years).

I think their insurance is available to non military in all but a handful of states. If you live in one of those states, you're out of luck. But otherwise, it's really good/cheap insurance.  It's incredibly easy to not only get a quote online, but to go ahead and make your policy active.  In under 30 minutes, you can setup a policy on your car and print out the insurance cards. I once did that on my mobile browser while at a dealership purchasing a car. I had the card faxed to them - never spoke to a single person.

They also have really good loan programs. Again, you can get pre-approved for a car loan online and print out a funds transfer slip (almost like a check) to take to a car dealer.  The dealer just has to fax the paper in with their information and it gets wired to their account (and the loan becomes active).

The number of things you can do without talking to them is impressive, but their phone support is great. I called up to get information on landlord insurance and within 20 minutes, I was signed up for homeowners/landlord insurance on a house I was planning to rent out. I was rather pleased because I was expecting my landlord insurance to be higher than my homeowners, and I ended up saving $500 (I was using a different provider) overall.

And I don't expect to be surprised when they reveal who [killed the Doctor (likely River, again)](/spoiler), and why they did it.

As far as WTF stuff, there's the first 2 episodes, and the mid-season finale, so that's 3 in only half a season (the finale totally counts, since they didn't explain why they thought the Doctor was a bad guy, who put it together, why they wanted River (how they knew she was part time lord (or even that she existed)), or how a Silurian ended up in 19th century London). 

I think sometimes Moffat forgets the show is called ""Doctor Who"", not ""River Who.""

You could argue that any sort of control is inherently bad, but I have a hard time going along with that. I mean, going to the moon is considered one of our greatest achievements, who cares where the idea came from?  Until they use it for something tangibly bad (like space-war with another alien species or something), I don't have a problem with them.

I've been assuming that the memory-erasing is part of their biology, which would mean they survive by manipulating other species; a kind of parasite. In which case, the Doctor killed them for evolving the way they did. 

So, yea, I hope they do explain their motivations later on, and [little River](/spoiler) is more interesting to me as far as meeting the Doctor for the first time, and how big of a role she (as a child) will play in the next season. 

I personally don't have a problem with the gun thing, but the Doctor should; he's a would-be pacifist. Jack was great, but he wasn't supposed to be a love interest for the Doctor- Doc was even annoyed with him half the time. That relationship made a lot more sense.

If River hadn't fallen asleep in a tanning bed, and had darker hair, she'd be a little better-looking, I think. She'd still have Gonzo's schnozz, though. Jenny is pretty much my ideal, visually.

But when my oldest was a toddler, I got some School House Rock videos that he loved and wanted to watch all the time - and one afternoon, we were watching the ""Figure Eight"" song, and it *finally* clicked, when they said ""12 x 8 is the same as 10 x 8 plus 2 x 8.  80 + 16 = 96!""  I was like *oh. my. god.  WHY did no one ever explain it like that before??*  I finally got it - at 27 years old.  That you could manipulate numbers until they were manageable.  That you could break stuff down, and move it around; that math could actually be interesting, and yes, even *fun*.  That 3 minute song taught me more about how math works than 12 years of public school math classes and 8 credits of college math did.  How sad is that?

true,ax4of9,null,null,"And if Carroll gets injured? 

I don't deny that Downing is proven in the Premier League, and that his crossing is probably better than Mata, but that's about all. 

If we look at stats, Mata scored 8 goals last season and had 12 assists. Downing scored 7 goals and had 7 assists. 

If we look at age, Mata is 23 years old, Downing is 26. This means that not only does Mata have more potential for growth, he can also become a long-term fixture for Liverpool. 

Most importantly, like the article mentioned, I believe that Liverpool are likely to play a 4-3-3 formation next season. Since most modern 4-3-3s play with 3 central midfielders, the width is usually provided by the fullbacks and the forward wingers. In this respect, Mata is more versatile than Downing, since he is almost like a left-footed Suarez. 

With Mata on the left and Suarez on the right, they can provide the passes and crosses for Carroll. At anytime, they can switch flanks, where they can cut in and shoot, giving another dimension to their game. 

Most importantly, Mata can replace Suarez in times of injury. It seems likely that Carroll and Kuyt will be rotated, and Kuyt will surely benefit more from the creativity of Mata than from the crosses of Downing. 

I like Downing, and I will be stoutly behind him if Liverpool buys him. In fact, I prefer Downing over Young.

It was great while it lasted, though - I got some Brighton to London return tickets for £1 each way a few times, just had to book a week or so in advance.

I just checked the [Megabus site](http://uk.megabus.com/default.aspx) and that confirms it - Brighton is no longer listed on the list of possible locations. That's sad, no more £1 tickets :(

Given that Megabus isn't an option any more, your cheapest option is probably [National Express](http://www.nationalexpress.com/). Exact same route (Pool Valley to London Victoria Bus Station). They have special cheap tickets called [""Fun Fares""](http://www.nationalexpress.com/coach/Offers/funfare/funfares.cfm?setcal=S), which are restricted, very unflexible tickets that you have to book well in advance. You can get a single ticket for as low as £2.50 if you book around a week in advance, but I believe they charge a £1 booking fee and probably a couple of other extras as well. Still, much cheaper than the train (which was around £20 for an adult ticket last time I took it).

The journey time is usually about 2 to 2 and a half hours, depending on traffic.

Several people have put forth missives in here on how River will **definitely** be snuffing Rory come the Autumn, as he's a good man - but to me it all sounds like a flimsy case of people seeing the cool plot twist they want to see.  You can make a conjectural case for all kinds of wild theories, but there's more than enough waggle room for Moffat to make pretty much anything happen and justify it sufficiently.  

After all, River didn't just say she killed a good man, he was described as the best man she'd ever known, and a hero to many.  To me, those words describe the Doctor more closely than Rory (what with him being the central character and hero of the show, etc.) but my point is that there's enough room in there for it to be either one.

All I tend to go on is what I think is most likely, bearing in mind the plot is intended to make sense for children as well as adults.  River being Amy's daughter turned out to be the most likely plot progression, turned out to be the case, and then people complained 'cos it wasn't twisty-turny enough for them!

What we do know is that the Doctor dies by a mysterious figure wearing a space suit that was later worn by a character that seems to be young River Song, and that River says she killed a man fitting the description of the doctor.  This all might be a bluff, and Rory may be in for a permanent fall, but I just can't see Moffat being that artless or that bleak.

I fired a .22, a 9mm Beretta and a .44 magnum.  Yeah, it was cool.  A bit scary/awe inspiring, but cool.

I remember thinking at the time that it's the kind of thing I would do again if I had a gun club near me (this one was about an hour away - a bit far to just drop in for a quick shoot).  But then my coworker explained about all the rules and regulations you had to follow before you could join a gun club, and then you had to be a member for so many years before you could own your own guns, and then you had to have all the special gun cabinets, follow more rules and regulations, have police inspections, and so on.

true,flo1190,tardis,TARDIS,"i really dont want to do this!! just know i love each and every one of them. but here goes. oh, and im also a new-who child, so my viewing of the classic doctors isnt extensive enough to make a full judgement.

1) David Tennant (10) - because he was MY Doctor. He brought out every shade of the Doctor's personality, and his personal love for the show resonated in every scene. 

2) Patrick Troughton (2) - I simply adore him. So understated in each scene, he just plays the Doctor so well. My favourite scenes of him are with the third doctor. The bickering between them is just brilliant.

3) Matt Smith (11) - Oh how I kicked and screamed about him becoming the Doctor. No fault of his own, but he had the toughest job of following David Tennant and had a lot to prove. But within about 5 minutes of The Eleventh Hour, he had me. He is everything the Doctor should be. 

4) Tom Baker (4) - Whilst I love the vibrancy and eccentricity he brought to the role, sometimes I found him too consuming of everything around him. But he was a defining Doctor, and the show seemed so soar joyfully with him in it.

5) Christopher Eccleston (9) - I just wish that we could've seen a bit more of Eccleston. I think he could've taken his Doctor further. But he had the very unique role of being the Doctor born of the Time War, and he played it brilliantly. At the time, I was devastated to see him go.
here it starts to get a little fuzzy...

6) Sylvester McCoy (7) - Yes, I know, controversial. But what can I say? I have a soft spot for him. Love him and Ace, and I think he is severely underrated. Played so many sides to the Doctor, and its a shame that the show ended on his shoulders, because it wasnt his fault

7) Peter Davison (5) - the only reason he's this low down is because Ive never really connected with him as the Doctor. He was a hero, but wasnt as fierce and dark as some of the others. The era he was in was very special to the show, and I think he is a brilliant actor.

8) Jon Pertwee (3) - Love him as the Doctor, but I have to say, Im not really a UNIT fan. Also, theres something about him that I cant quite put my finger on, that turns me away from him slightly. But I love his Doctor's personality.
 

9) Colin Baker (6) - Oh, Colin. If only the writing had been better, if only he hadnt have worn that costume, if only he'd been given a real chance. because I do think he had the capability to be brilliant. On times he could overplay it, but there were many moments where he shined. He deserved better than the show gave him.

10) William Hartnell (1) - Whilst he was the first, the Doctors that followed seem very different to him, which detaches him slightly. Im just not convinced that the Grumpy Old Man works for the Doctor.

11) Paul McGann (8) - I have a confession to make. I have only seen a bit of the TV Movie and therefore cant make a proper judgement on 
McGann, but I liked what I saw of the actor. I wish he'd had a proper chance.",0,1310559801,null,0,false,0,c25cbmf,t3_ioc7k,t1_c25cbmf,t3_ioc7k,1427344430,5,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,5

if I were the owner of this car, I would feel like shit about this case, and would want to do something to own up to my share of the responsibility. communicate with the police about who was driving it. if it was a stolen car, in other words, if the person he loaned it to loaned it to someone else, etc, then they are guilty of that too.",0,1310567369,null,0,false,0,c25cxfs,t3_inmzu,t1_c25cxfs,t1_c25blrk,1427344715,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

Forced integration is somewhat hard on kids... because it's more pleasant to go with your peers all the way through primary school and secondary school. I went to an inner-city highschool in Seattle which was part of a bussing program and anglos like me were a minority. It wasn't the greatest learning environment for me. I would have done much better in the suburban school district where I had been living before.  

However, this bussing program - and the federal requirement of school integration here in the USA - has solved the very problem which we still see in Northern Ireland. We used to have fights between different neighborhoods in the same way in the 1950s. It's kind of surreal to me to see that folks in Belfast think that they need to build high walls and fences between neighborhoods of the two religious backgrounds. As long as those fences remain up, the problem is festering like an open wound. Those wounds need to be healed... and in my opinion, it frankly doesn't matter if locals don't like the taste of the medicine which is required to accomplish that. If locals won't make the strides they need to, in order to achieve peace between neighbors in that region, then the national government needs to step in and force through policies which will do so.

It's interesting how certain Western countries adopt policies that solve core problems that they're having, and other sibling countries never go over and learn from the results of those projects. Another example is how Australia has, for decades, used the electoral systems of Proportional Representation for their upper house, and AV for their lower house. The resulting good governance is obvious, and yet in the UK, the USA, and Canada - we're still struggling with the problems which First Past the Post creates.

&gt; Chelsea hopeful Scott Parker loan move will gain approval from West Ham
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Last updated July 12 2011 10:08PM
&gt;
&gt; Chelsea have asked to sign Scott Parker on loan for the season while they cope with the absence of Michael Essien, who could miss the campaign with a knee injury.
&gt;
&gt;The West London club believe that the plan to sign their former midfield player could be attractive to West Ham United, who want to trim the wage bill after relegation to the npower Championship. West Ham would prefer a permanent transfer because, as well as the fee, the club would not be saddled with the four years he has on his deal, worth about £60,000 a week in wages. Chelsea would be expected to pay a loan fee of about £1.5 million.
&gt;
&gt;Harry Redknapp is interested in Parker but Daniel Levy, his Tottenham Hotspur chairman, is unwilling to pay West Ham's valuation of £8 million for a 30-year-old with probably no sell-on value. Aston Villa have an interest and similar concerns, but believe that Parker may be willing to take a wage cut.
&gt; **Chelsea, who have been offered Jermaine Jenas, the Tottenham midfield player** , have not been put off by Levy's refusal to sell Luka Modric, even though the midfield player is expected to travel with the squad on the club's pre-season tour to South Africa today.
&gt;
&gt;Niko Kranjcar believes that Tottenham will not allow him to leave if Modric is sold and will look for a loan move if his fellow Croatia midfield player stays at White Hart Lane.
&gt;

From the newest Torchwood: Miracle Day Episode 1... Everyone in the world is immortal, while Jack is turned mortal.

The above is no spoiler, as that's the point of the show...  Here is something which could be a spoiler, but not really.

Someone dies in an explosion, but they cannot die (do to this miracle day)... it shows a barely together piece of burnt flesh that is somehow still alive and conscious. Jack is in the room while this is being shown.  He asks, what would happen if you removed the mostly mangled head from the rest of the body.  They sever the head, and the head is still alive from the eye movements, and thus the person survives.  So yes, jack could be the face of boe if his head was removed from his body and survive forever.

From the Telegraph:  

&gt; Sky News is reporting that News Corp has withdrawn its bid to take over BSkyB. This may look like Rupert Murdoch caving in to the might of the British Parliament; but far more significant, surely, is the news that the US Senate is encouraging an investigation into News Corp. The disease is spreading. As my colleague Toby Harnden blogged overnight:  
&gt;&gt;What does this mean? Well, it’s big. It hints that other agencies – the most obvious one is the SEC – will indeed investigate. **And it all but says that News Corp will be history if it turns out any American citizen had their phone hacked**. Remember, the White House thinks Fox News is the epitome of evil and Democrats control the Senate. This could be very, very bad indeed for Murdoch.    

&gt; In other words, with News Corp’s entire future in jeopardy, even BSkyB’s billions of revenue look like small change.

&gt; All day I’ve been calling and emailing Senate and House of Representatives offices trying to get someone, anyone to say something, anything about the News of the World phone hacking scandal.... extraordinarily, no one would speak to the issue, not even the most Murdoch-despising, Fox bashing Democrat. **By the evening, however, I began to get indications that senior Democrats were waiting to see which way the Obama administration wanted to jump**.

*Tom loved visual jokes, provided they weren’t too obvious. He was always wanting the scarf to be made longer and longer, so that he could use it for comic business. When I first joined I think he was onto about his fourth scarf, the longest yet, but he wanted one that was longer still. He suggested to me that the original scarf and the duplicate which was used by stuntmen should be sewn together, which made a scarf that was over twenty feet.

true,monkeytests,null,null,"&gt;What do you think is going on?

I think these connections are not very strong (with the exception of the one about Rory dying). Let me show you what I mean.

***About the TARDIS ""acting up""***

* The Eleventh Hour: It was rebuilding.

* Amy's Choice: The Doctor brought the pollen on board. Its a big stretch to attribute this to the TARDIS malfunctioning

* The Lodger: Not only does the Doctor know what the cause is, he later finds out why that abandoned ship got abandoned.  

* The Pandorica Opens""/""The Big Bang"" (it EXPLODED): Um, some unknown being (possibly using the Silence) caused that, not the TARDIS screwing up.

* ""Curse of the Black Spot"": This happens ALL THE TIME. Remember the Christmas Invasion? If those morons can do it, its not that special.

**TL;DR**: The only one which really fits your patern is The Eleventh Hour, but there is a good explanation and its not much of a pattern with one episode.


***About people setting up traps for the doctor***

* Victory of the Daleks: True, although their motivation was pretty clear and didn't really leave anything open ended.

* Amy's Choice: What? No. Again, he brought it on board, and the dream lord was himself. 

* The Lodger: Wrong. He was identified (incorrectly) as the correct pilot because he is a Time Lord. The thing wasn't explicitly programmed to recognize The Doctor. 

* The Pandorica Opens""/""The Big Bang"": This one fits. But the reasoning was explained.

* The Impossible Astronaut: I think its a stretch to include this one since its his plan (which i'm sure is going to make sense in a positive way eventually).

* The Doctor's Wife: Again, no one was really plotting against the Doctor, they were just looking for Time Lords (any Time Lords) and the reason they were doing so was neatly wrapped up.

* A Good Man Goes to War: This one fits.

**TL;DR**: This pattern has a few better hits, but is still pretty weak. The only un-resolved one is in A Good Man Goes to War, but it seems a huge stretch if you're thinking Victory to the Daleks or the Alliance to prevent the Doctor from destroying the Universe are part of some grand scheme.

true,suuuuuu,smith,Smith,"Several comments:  
  
TARDIS in ""The Eleventh Hour""--Rebuilding doesn't mean uncontrollable.  Twice, he showed up very late.  
  
Did the Doctor bring the pollen on board?  I don't remember that.  Also, it's been speculated that he lied about that (Valeyard theory).  I didn't explicitly state that that was my thinking.
  
""The Lodger""--you missed the point.  Who's building a TARDIS, and why can it interfere so severely with the Doctor's?  
  
TARDIS exploding: Yes, I know that, who?  Future Doctor?  People can't just taken control of the TARDIS and make it explode.  
  
Anyway, you're being way too literal and concrete in general--the connections aren't concretely strong.  I don't imagine there's a single, unifying cause (like someone keeps trying to kill him with elaborate plots) for Rory's repeated dying (most of them weren't in reality)--but Moffat said there's a reason.  So I applied this to other strange patterns.  Doesn't mean there's a single cause (or ""grand scheme) for each (eg the Dalek's plan was obviously separate and individual), but the fact that suspicious things keep happening in similar manners.  Will edit OP to be more clear, thanks for criticism.

&gt;Did the Doctor bring the pollen on board? I don't remember that.

Not on camera, but it came from an item which he was storing on board (which got too close to the 'time rotor' and heated up). As soon as they woke up, he knew exactly what it was.

&gt;""The Lodger""--you missed the point. Who's building a TARDIS, and why can it interfere so severely with the Doctor's?

No, I didn't. Those questions, while intriguing, do not fit the pattern of the TARDIS malfunctioning. Besides, I'm more than satisfied with the Doctor's explanation of the interference, and there was no reason given in the episode to assume he was lying. The TARDIS having trouble landing is not unique or special, its happened before - particularly when another TARDIS is involved.

Except someone did. Wonder who it will be. Still isn't malfunctioning.

true,mrlint,null,null,"So I've been doing some pondering on this. Let us presume for a moment that River is programmed (or whatever) to have to kill the doctor. That is her only purpose. Her life can't really be normal until then. Now lets also presume that the Doctor has been trying to change this from happening, by interacting with river since her childhood trying to alter the course. At some point he realizes this must happen in order for River to be free.

So, while this has been brought up before, consider this. In day of the moon Moffat has laid out the fate of the Silence by using their own subversive method against them. Also consider that Kovarian has already punked the Doctor 2x with flesh replicas. We can only reasonably presume that Kovrian does not know that the Tardis can stabilize an autonomous flesh. So its very in character for the Doctor to go and punk her back, make her think her plan has succeeded only to pop back out of the woodwork for inevitable victory.

  Shout outs to the crew:

  Tom Watson - not all MPs are rotten

  UKUncut - great work despite the METs utterly
            devious attempt to blacken your
            name on March 26
  
  New Statesmen - for running great politically
                  biting stuff like interviews  
                  with the bass player in Blur.
                  
  Hugh Grant - if we have to be ruled by Tories
               then we'd rather it be you than
               the current lot.
               
  Kate Bush - not sure remaking the your old
              songs is the best use of your time.
              Just sayin'
  
  Little Nicky Clegg - go on, pull out, send them
                       crashing down. 
  
  Fred West as played by the bloke from The Wire 
  (looking forward to this - aren't you?)
  
  istyosty - saving us from increasing the ad revenue of 
             the Daily Mail since 1873. Love to you.

  Dappy of the So Solid Crew - big love to the man.
  R3m3mb3r h8ers h8 &amp; lov3rs lov3.

I think you're taking 'unproductive' a little too literally considering we are talking about a childrens TV show. As you said, its a discussion, not a debate, and once the back and forth consists of the two of us repeating the same points in different ways I would consider that unproductive in that it no longer provides anyone with any entertainment.

The first Doctor didn't actually know *how* to fly the TARDIS or that it's alive; he had to keep a little notebook as he figured out the various instruments and codes and whatnot. One assumes he's still figuring it out as the second Doctor.

The third Doctor basically spends all his time trying to get the TARDIS running again. Once the Time Lords give him the missing demat circuit he still needs to rebuild the console and calibrate.

Just as he starts to exert some control over his destinations, he has to install a randomizer to avoid the Black Guardian. It's not really until he has Adric's help, I think, that he really begins to understand how to pilot the TARDIS effectively; it's only after he returns from e-space that we actually see him start turning up at destinations he's actually aiming for.

So I'd say the *earliest* we can actually ascribe agency to the TARDIS (as opposed to operator error) is when the randomiser is installed (because then she is explicitly choosing the destinations). After 5's tenure begins the TARDIS becomes more reliable and can also be ascribed agency when he winds up in unexpected locations (witness his troubles getting to the Eye of Orion, for instance).",0,1310598927,null,0,false,0,c25gy7a,t3_ioi7g,t1_c25gy7a,t1_c25fl60,1427346611,2,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,2

Firstly the lettings agency is talking rubbish (it might take 6 months, but it probably won't and it is not in any way scary), but remember, they work for the landlord, not you, so basically do not trust them, from this point onwards do absolutely everything in writing.

Write the landlord or the agency a letter saying that you believe their charges are unfair, say way, and tell them you will get contacting the TDS (just read below that your deposit is protected with them) in 10 working days or something if you do not receive the money/receipts. Tell them that you did not sign an inventory. Tell them that at arbitration the onus will be on them to prove that all the costs are valid, there are some really good templates on the internet. Shelter has some particularly good resources.

Assuming that they don't crumble, contact TDS and they will take it from there.

A Good Man Goes to War: Red bow tie


Please let me know if I've missed / messed up any bow tie color changes.
It was difficult to tell in some instances because of the poor video quality paired with dark lighting in certain shots.

Maybe the Doctor just likes to switch it up from time to time, and it means nothing...
or maybe there's something significant to it?

Maybe dreams vs. reality has something to do with it?

Maybe he's not doing these things in a linear fashion? Red bow tie = younger; blue bow tie = older?
[But it seems odd that the Doctor could swap from younger to older while he's still travelling with Amy and Rory...]

And / or maybe there is ANOTHER, non-flesh clone / duplicate of the Doctor running around? 
[Still seems odd that he could swap?]

WELL~ I guess he could swap while they're sleeping.

Well, then I guess I should stop procrastinating on my write-up. What really struck me about this episode was how much i took to it. This felt completely like Doctor Who to me, and, unlike our previous three, I barely even noticed the pacing. With the previous three selections, I was definitely thinking, ""yes, but this is *classic* Who."" There was still a tiny bit of disconnect, albeit for different reasons in each.

Sarah Jane--I think my heart just broke a little again. She's so fierce, so vibrant. I can definitely see how she redefined the role of companion. After this, I was looking for some other random serials, and, liking Troughton, I decided to try out The Two Doctors. Seeing the Sixth and Peri (I think?) was kind of depressing. Sixth is a bit of an ass towards her, and she's fairly helpless (granted, so is Jamie at certain points). But there's none of that with Sarah Jane. The Doctor knows more than her, certainly, but there's not so much of a gulf between them. 

I've always had a sort of instant liking for the Third Doctor, even without seeing him. The bit at the end where the peasant calls him a magician, and he denies it, yet Sarah Jane agrees--that was interesting. being a magician, a trickster, is very much a Doctor-y trait to me. At the same time, there's a certain amount of action hero in the Third I don't really associate with The Doctor in general, and yet it fits. 

The evil medieval guy was pretty much chewing the scenery. Meh. The Sontaran didn't make a huge impression on me, but they never really have, aside from the nurse in A Good Man Goes to War.

but... it's ""Doctor Who"", not ""Amelia Pond"", the intro makes it seem like the show revolves around her, which is weird imo.

The Medway Towns aren't as bad as you'd think. I lived in Chatham town-centre for a year and although a few incidents took place, it's bearable and I'd say that is the worst of it. Other parts of Medway such as Rochester and Rainham are actually quite friendly and nice. 

East Kent, including Canterbury is much nicer, the town has a nice student vibe and loads of good pubs, plus a lot of tourist attractions which gives it a good vibe in summer. To the North you've got the Isle of Sheppey (Which should be avoided at all costs, think Mad-Max crossed with 'Lost'. Just stay away)

The other parts of the coast such as Ramsgate, Margate etc. are a bit run-down but the countryside is quite nice and it has some lovely coastal views/walks going right round to Dover and leading to Sussex.

I actually live in Maidstone and have done for years, It's the 'county' town and has a lot to give. Good pubs, good shopping, nice parks but slightly let down by it's lack of culture (No football ground, rubbish theatre, very little tourist interest) It is still a nice place to live. 

Outdoor sports-wise, there are a LOT of countryside paths, as with most of England. We have a few BMX tracks and plenty of cycle routes. As for trekking, we have the North Downs Way which spans right from East to West, following the ancient 'Pilgrim's Way' along with the 'Saxon Way' coastal path, tracing Dover and Hastings.

&gt;That's why you're more related to people within your own population. I still think it's bullshit that I could be more related to a black person than to somebody who is white.

Okay, a woman has 2 white kids. One marries a black woman, the other marries a white woman. In 4 generations time, her different great-great grandchildren will appear to completely black and/or completely white. However, these black kids and white kids are much more closely related genetically than they are to the rest of the population.

Not only that, but think of it like this. Say humans have ten genes. 1 for race, and 9 for everything else. You could share 1 race gene with someone from your own race, but share 9 of the other genes with someone from another race.

There are only small differences, genetically, between different races. It is possible that the inherent genetic variation between every human can in fact be greater than, and override, the small genetic differences that race provides.

Also, being closely related in terms of family, is not the same as sharing genetic code. You can and do share a lot of genetic code with everyone.

&gt;So, as a population spreads out, you become less and less related to people.

Yes, and eventually, within any population this reaches a point where you are as genetically similar to people within your own population, as you are to people outside it.

Anyway, I have told you you are wrong, given you evidence, backed it up, you've rattled off some pseudo-waffle, and yet you choose to remain in the wrong. Perhaps this is the sort of mind-frame of people that ""understand the logic behind racism""?

It is wonderful to feel part of a small nation, one with a great sense of pride and history and with deep cultural roots. We got our own parliament, independent of London in 1997 and set up what is still one of the greenest governments in the World. Wales has a beautiful if not often rugged landscape and that fosters in many people a deep sense of respect and awe for the natural world. Wales also has primary resources; once it was coal, now we are more interested in our forests, water, wind resources. Some of the most innovative renewable energy companies are here and that has attracted many innovative people to the area, or retained the ones from here. 
Wales has no international enemies, no partisan religious war and enjoys excellent international relations, often with other smaller upland nations, like Austria, Slovenia, Finland with whom we find we have lots in common.

true,DaveLambert,tardis,TARDIS,"I've worked as the ""news guy"" at the TVShowsOnDVD.com website for almost 10 years.  Despite the fact that I've always loved British TV, I was confused when I began that job because the BBC Video releases of TV-DVDs would say ""Series 1"", ""Series 2"", etc.  I inquired with them and, here's a copy-and-paste of the reply I got, which I've saved all these years:

&gt;David, as you know there are different terms for the same thing in America and the United Kingdom. Here we have jumpers and chips; you call them sweaters and fries. Here we take a programme like ""All Creatures Great and Small"" and each production year is called a series, where you know it as a ""season"" in the States. And in the States, when you refer to the entire production of the television show, you call it the entire ""series"", where here we call it the ""programme"". Or, ""program"" as you like to spell it over there. It's simply a horse of a different colour.

So, yeah: U.S.A. = Seasons for individual production years, and Series for the entire run of the show, but in the U.K. the same things are called Series and Program(me)s.

However, I've noticed in recent years that for many BBC Video releases of DVDs, they are starting to adapt the USA words, at least on the North American releases.  For example, Hotel Babylon is labeled ""Series 2"", ""Series 3"", etc. in the U.K., but my Region 1 copies of the DVDs are labeled ""Season 2"", ""Season 3"", etc.  The Torchwood and Sarah Jane Adventures box sets use the word ""Seasons"".  But for Doctor Who they continue to call them ""Series"".  Which I think leads to confusion like the op's explanation.",0,1310649225,null,0,false,0,c25kpnb,t3_ipcoz,t1_c25kpnb,t3_ipcoz,1427348443,6,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,6
