He didn't ""expect"" to enter my home.  In fact I think he was mildly surprised to be invited in, as he had turned up unexpectedly (naturally - what point would there be in a pre-arranged visit ?).  
  
I'm half (quarter LOL) thinking of actually buying a television for my new place.  One of those new-fangled flat ones.  If I do, then I will pay for a licence.  For people who are into TV I actually think it's a very small price to pay for the hours of entertainment they benefit from.

 - Bring in a top-notch striker and sell either Defoe or Crouch.
 - Sign a central defender who isn't constantly hurt: I would be absolutely over the moon if we brought in Per Mertesacker, but that'll never happen.

So far we've brought in two players (Coulibaly and that one kid from Barca) who won't contribute for 2-3 years at minimum, made just one sale (O'Hara), and apparently Brad Freid-Overthehill is supposed to be the solution to our goalkeeping problems.

My primary area of interest is law. While it's true that the UK could achieve similar legislative programmes in or out of the EU it would be impossible to achieve the level of pan-European harmonisation that is being created in it.

The headlines often rant against EU meddling (chocolate definitions, bacon regulations, etc.) but I would imagine that having identical regulations across the EU would strongly bolster the ability of business to branch out across Europe with reduced administrative costs. A lawyer would never have been able to have worked a UK-German issue without German partners (or a German division, if a huge firm) previously. But if a form of EU sanctioned Euro-Contract law was created that could indeed reduce barriers that the UK on it's own could not achieve. The same applies to a potential Euro-Mortgage (Hypothec) which by virtue of it's EU wide nature could create an entirely new international market.

These are just random examples. A point made to me recently is that there has been no comprehensive, open, review as to the merits and demerits of being within the EU. Until such a study is done it seems any discussion will always lack a proper point of reference.

I personally watch a reasonable amount of BBC content (which is what the fee is for, after all) on iPlayer. But as I don't watch live (the only worthwhile reason would be news, but there's a million other sources) I don't have to pay the fee.

Technology is moving constantly towards the internet, and a larger and larger proportion of content users will migrate to the net and forget about the licencing fee. The BBC funding will eventually dry up.

So what's the alternative? Assuming we want a strong BBC (all signs point to yes) it seems we're looking at taxation. But the inherent problem is that the gov't will hold influence over the Corp, which goes against its independence. This could destroy it.

It's also a good sign that we have the money available but just need to unearth the right player. Modric is actually a great example of this - we paid what, around 15 million? and he fit within the wage structure (I still think we missed a trick with Suarez in January).

You will always have a situation where an individual choice is taken from them in a tiny minority of cases - such as insanity, etc. It is impossible to design any system affecting 60 million people that wont have a tiny number of unfortunate side-effects. Impossible. To say that you therefore should do nothing is however a daft way to develop any system.

If you didn't opt out then you are deemed to be willing to donate organs - why should the next of kin have the right to override your decision?

[New Man City-Etihad deal](www.guardian.co.uk/football/2011/jul/08/manchester-city-deal-etihad-airways]. This one notes that the deal includes a 10-year extension to the shirt sponsorship deal, and given the precedents set above by United and Liverpool I don't think it's unreasonable to conclude that the shirt sponsorship takes up at least 200m of the 400m total - possibly more if accounting for inflation.

The article also notes the JP Morgan deal for Madison Square Garden - more than I remebered at 187m. Why would it be unreasonable to compare a big EPL stadium with MSG? The City of Manchester stadium puts on more than just football matches, and gets an awful lot of worldwide exposure, especially now they're a CL team. I don't mean to be completely equating the two, but they're in the same ball park is my point.

So if we say 225m for the shirt rates and 175m for the stadium, although high those rates aren't too exaggerated from what their competitors now have and will be expecting to get over the next ten years.

After all that, I'm not saying there's not plenty dodgy about the whole situation. There are provisions in the new UEFA financial rules to stop this sort of patronage, but I think given the precedents above it'll just about squeeze through approval.

When comparing it the Arsenal-Emirates deal we should keep in mind how butt-hurt Arsenal are over that now that a significant number of their competitors have signed far more lucrative deals since - I think even our most recent deal beat it.

Anfield and Old Trafford would probably be the most renowned of the English grounds and I don't think either could be argued to have the same branding power as Madison Square Garden.

But it does sound like we are probably arguing the same point. Arsenal signed a deal that with hindsight is not looking as good as it seemed to them at the time. Manchester City will use their dubious sponsorship connections to channel the absolute maximum they can into the club while keeping within what can be argued to be a fair market value.

I like people that can do that.

&gt;My primary area of interest is law. While it's true that the UK could achieve similar legislative programmes in or out of the EU it would be impossible to achieve the level of pan-European harmonisation that is being created in it.

Pan-European harmonisation is great and if I were France, the Netherlands, Belgium, Germany, Austria, Italy, Slovenia,...,... I'd probably see lots of reasons why there should be some time of EU model.  I think the EU has been far too ambitious and expanded to quickly.  It has even become clear now with Spain, which had been an EU success story, that forced growth makes for rocky foundations, but essentially the idea behind the EU is a good one even if it does come with certain risks.

Well, my attitude to that would be the continent can have this model and the UK can benefit from it, but they don't have to be in it.  Yes, I'm aware that might seem a little selfish because the UK would be benefiting from something it is not directly contributing too but I've thought about it and  I'm good with it.   I dare say they'd find ways to benefit from us, like we all already do Norway, Switzerland and Iceland.

&gt;The headlines often rant against EU meddling (chocolate definitions, bacon regulations, etc.) but I would imagine that having identical regulations across the EU would strongly bolster the ability of business to branch out across Europe with reduced administrative costs.

Occasionally when I'm talking about my stance on the UK leaving the EU somebody will make a slight or accusation that anti-EU people are xenophobic.  It's true some people do work very hard to dishonestly equate UKIP with the BNP and their racism.  Whenever the accusation is leveled I love answering it with the same answer to your comment here, that is that I completely trust the Germans, the Nordic countries and France to come up with completely sensible standardisation and regulations in the norm without any UK say in the matter.  Even if the UK did have a problem with a regulation the reality is at the moment they might have a say, but it's not a particularly weighty say.  If however a contract was to be put to tender for a company to research standardisation of packaging, for example, wouldn't we all want the successful company to have the ruthless practicality and precision of German engineering?  I certainly trust the French with food regulation, it's like a religion to them.  Whether the UK is in the EU or not Europe's always going to be the major trading partner so any producers are going to make products that conform with EU regulations.  In reality we copy, not because we have to, but because what difference does it make if Hans wants to change the shape of the bottle my fabric conditioner comes in to make it more efficient?  If there is any regulation that doesn't sit well then at least the UK would have the privilege of not having to adopt it.  But in the main, in this respect, I can't be accused of racism that some might try, I'm all for delegating it to the EU with no UK input.  I trust them to come up with good ideas and it doesn't compromise the UK at all.

&gt;if a form of EU sanctioned Euro-Contract law was created that could indeed reduce barriers that the UK on it's own could not achieve.

When it comes to contract law that's one barrier/line of defence that I would want the UK to have.  It could still respect EU contract law when dealing with Europe.  The UK has to learn to realise that it is a major net contributer to the EU, one of the most developed, and set to be the smallest receiver per capita - whatever bar the EU sets across its 27 states it is one that the least amongst them have to be able to  achieve.  EU contract law should be UK contract law lite.  It would lead to elements of protectionism.  I'm okay with that too.

&gt;A point made to me recently is that there has been no comprehensive, open, review as to the merits and demerits of being within the EU.

For me the double barreled shotgun blast of diminished democratic representation and the Common Fisheries Policy should be a game ending deal breaker for the UK.  The fact that government has to match EU grants and subsidy to get access to money awarded to them is just the cherry on the top.  That the UK could actually take control of its own trade without having to go through an appointed commissioner is the sweet Amaretto seeping into my chocolate sponge.

Irrespective of what you say the tabloids use or dont use (i do not have a theory on tabloids)  *its simply my understanding and explanation* -  i can understand why you would be called an aids victim or a rape victim,  - which would be something external and *possibly* preventable if you had known something in advance.

true,TossersUnite,uk,United Kingdom,"Again, thanks for the hearty reply. 

If I've correctly read the thrust of your argument, you seem to advocate a mainland EU, from which the UK would benefit by accepting a decent proportion of regulations into domestic law where they work. You say you're comfortable with this, but would the other countries be? 

I'm no economist, but are Norway (with fishing and oil) and Switzerland (finance) not especially well placed to do well outside of the Union? Would the UK not suffer for sitting outside from it's trading partners?  

UKIP is an interesting party. I'm not well versed in their policies, but I am dimly aware of some very reactionary and regressive tendencies. Nigel Farrage once asserted that the UK prison population should rise, because we have a large number of criminals, for example. Their defence policy is equally barmy, with delusions of grandeur in massive increases for no apparent reason. It also deployed enormous posters of Churchill and Union Flags before elections, as if we were warring with Europe. Search for them on google and their spiel reads 'Libertarian, non-racist party'. Trying too hard? I'm not suggesting they (and certainly not you) are racist. I'm just saying that I find UKIP hard to take seriously. 

But that's kind of beside the point. The main issue is surely that we simply don't know the full picture. You don't like the CFP, matching grants or having to act through the Commissioner. But what if gains are made elsewhere? It's such an enormously complicated (not to mention plain enormous) institution that I cannot see how anyone can strongly claim IN or OUT with great conviction. The international repercussions of leaving it (considering there's no precedent) are impossible to predict.

Even in the Doctor's most desperate moments, there was always time to find joy and delight in the small things. 

And he always believes in and hopes for the best in others. This was most evident with Donna Noble, who has been my favorite companion since the series pseudo-reset. The awkward woman who was ""just a temp"" could alter the course of the universe (and what a perfect last name...). I feel like the Doctor sees this potential in everyone and that aspect of the show is the reason I keep watching.

true,ClampingNomads,null,null,"&gt;I think I probably would push that theoretical button which eliminated the State that anarchist writers have philosophised about, but only because almost anything has to be better than the world which capitalism has created. But I'd have to think long and hard about it and what would need to happen in the aftermath first.

Think long and hard indeed: we have millions of people - the vast majority of the population - tightly packed in urban areas where food and warmth are completely contingent on an economy which smoothly delivers food and power via cheap oil. If anything disrupts the international flow of refined oil products for longer than a few weeks, there are - necessarily - going to be some pretty nasty adjustments made pretty quickly. I do not think any effective form of non-hierarchical economic structure could take shape sufficiently quickly to avoid absolute catastrophe. By catastrophe, I mean non-availability of fresh water and sufficient food to the populations of cities.

I am drawn to the philosophy of anarchism, but I'm convinced of two things if that button were pressed in real life: 1. That there would be an awful lot of death in the short to medium term, and 2. The only respite would come when an economic structure able to supply people's basic needs were re-created, OR the people adopt ways of living in which such infrastructure is not needed. In the circumstances that would surround the sudden collapse of the previous ""arrangements"", and given the mindset and expectations of most people, I can't see any realistic hope of this happening in a non-hierarchical way. 

There is no historical inevitability about anarchism, any more than Marxism, IMO. (I know you never said there was, just sayin'). I wish I could be more upbeat about what is a fundamentally fair political philosophy, but I've pretty much abandoned it, for the same reason I'm not studying the ideal politics of Mars: I don't live there, either.

That's why much anarchist activism is aimed at exploring more sustainable lifestyles, considering ways to expand individuals' and communities' power to determine their own destinies and to take care of their own needs.  I'm definitely not a year zero kind of activist, but I'm also certain that, if I were ever in the (supremely hypothetical) position of holding the key to some sort of disruptive technology which would eliminate scarcity, I'd obviously take any (personal) risk to release it to the world.  That's more what I'm thinking about in my previous post, rather than having some sort of perfectly targeted ""government bomb"" or similar (:-P to the Met who are doubtless reading this, there you go, I'm not one of your bombers, so now you're quite free to go surveil someone else!)

Is the above utopian?  Probably, but who knows where technology will take us?  In the meantime, I'll remain an activist in the much smaller ways outlined above - attacking hierarchy and authoritarianism, promoting sustainability, critiquing capitalism and the unsustainable exponential growth it's based on, looking for, working with and promoting disruptive technologies and radically democratic movements, etc. etc.

Edit:  Just out of interest.  The Spanish/Catalonian example was not a perfect one by any means, there were some egregious crimes committed in those turbulent times by all sides.  But, given the state of war with multiple sides which existed, and accepting that the Spanish anarchists were much more prepared for the situation in which they found themselves because of decades of anarchist tradition (although they were undoubtedly surprised by how quickly things went their way) and that this was a much more heavily agrarian rather than urban industrial society, nonetheless, they were remarkably successful in feeding the population and getting production moving again, even despite the ongoing war.

The way I see it, there's definitely some kind of line from cause to effect, but that line doesn't necessarily have to be straight. But life is always experienced on a straight line...

Take the Doctor's timeline. It's a jumbled up mess of knots and twists. Pull it straight and tight, and watch spacetime warp itself around him. Freaky-deaky, right?

So, just like time has a vortex that encompasses it's entirety (the untempered schism, and the heart of the tardis), so does cause and effect have it's own vortex that represents the *progression* of the time vortex, a space that spacetime itself travels through. It's how the timelords can sense changes in time, or remember things that were changed to never happen, because in the causal vortex, they did happen.

It's like the grand paradox fixer! Time and space is in flux *in the causal vortex*.

There's also every chance he and his family have just had trouble settling in England. His wife seems like the glamorous sort, and Merseyside probably doesn't do it for her.

As for how he played... he found space, he made passes, he created 2 chances from corners (the first should have been a goal, the second was) and he had 2 great strikes from distance. Contrast that to Adam, who balanced out everything good he did with something poor. There's a moment in the first half that sums it up - Adam had the ball on a quick break, Henderson was clean through an onside on the left, and Adam decided to try to dribble past the 2 forwards that were a yard in front of him instead of put his teammate through. He was trying too hard to be a superstar.

They aren't happening at different times, they're happening in different orders.

There's a time-line, and a cause-to-effect line. I think for the most part, they're parallel, but the cause-to-effect line will sometimes curve and turn (relative to the time-line... They really both are wibbly-wobbley balls of stuff). It seems like the time-lords learned to travel the time-line quite well, but they were likely just learning to control the cause-to-effect line when they were wiped out. I imagine one would need to travel the cause-to-effect line to get to places like alternate universes (which the time-lords were said to be able to do at one point).

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt;You say you're comfortable with this, but would the other countries be?

That's exactly as it currently stands with the EEA.  Norway for example accepts all regulations when trading with the internal market but in turn as a non-EU member they get to operate within it.

&gt;I'm no economist, but are Norway (with fishing and oil) and Switzerland (finance) not especially well placed to do well outside of the Union? Would the UK not suffer for sitting outside from it's trading partners?

Well Swiss banking is actually fueled by being outside the EU, its landlocked 'isolation' and its neutrality.  The finance sector in the UK is a world leader, the argument being that it could actually do better outside the EU.  The UK wouldn't have to sit outside its trading partners, but its also excellently placed with its place in the Commonwealth and world links.   It already stands astride the Atlantic in acting on behalf of the EU.  In theory there's no reason why the UK should not be an entrepôt to the EU.  Something it could only do whilst outside the EU. 

&gt;UKIP is an interesting party. I'm not well versed in their policies, but I am dimly aware of some very reactionary and regressive tendencies. 

I agree with UKIP's position on Europe, I disagree with much of their other domestic and foreign policy.  I'm not a fan of their manifesto - I think they're better served working as a protest party.  That's what they're good at.  They even came second in the last European elections to the traditionally EU sceptical Tories.  As a domestic party I don't take them seriously at all, as a European protest party they demand respect even from their staunchest critics.  They got a higher percentage of the vote than Labour.

&gt;he main issue is surely that we simply don't know the full picture. You don't like the CFP, matching grants or having to act through the Commissioner. But what if gains are made elsewhere?

That's the point.  They could announce tomorrow there'd been an accountancy error and the UK was due a £100billion annual rebate and less representation with an appointed commission is, for me, still a deal breaker.  It's beyond the line in the sand.  Same goes for the CFP, it's literally killing UK fishing stock.  That's not even mine to kill, it also belongs to the generations that will come after me, the industry itself deserves protection and those communities based around it - much as little Norway's two sovereign wealth funds are the third largest in the world.  Norway's oil is seen to belong to future Norwegians just as much it belongs to today's Norwegians and those that drill for it.  It makes sense to drill and sell it now but much of the money is saved or ethically invested.

&gt; I cannot see how anyone can strongly claim IN or OUT with great conviction. 

For me it's like science.  It doesn't matter how many times results have shown a theory to work, you only need to find one case where the theory does not work to disprove it.  In this sense the question is whether there is one compromise made where no amount of compensation or reward elsewhere is enough.  In this case I'd argue yes.  If the EU were to have my backing it would have to be more representative and not less.  It's not.

&gt;The international repercussions of leaving it (considering there's no precedent) are impossible to predict.

Most things are impossible to predict but the UK can leave the EU and still have access to the internal market through joining the EEA.  Added to that whatever funding is put into Europe by the UK it receives less,  and it actually costs them more money to access EU grants made to them.  

*How much does it cost a year for Norway to be a member of the EEA?*     
Approximately, according to UK treasury figures, the same amount it currently costs the UK to be a member of the EU for one week.  In turn they get free movement of goods, persons, services and capital.

My own POV, which it sounds like you're broadly sympathetic with, is that the best that can be realistically achieved is to reduce peoples' reliance on massive, inherently dehumanising, means of production. To that end I tend to waffle about de-urbanisation and probably come across as something of a luddite (internet notwithstanding). 

I think ""utopian"" discussions can be worthwhile (and I probably was taking your ""button push"" a bit too seriously) but I get the feeling there are many people who need to realise that a sudden revolution could well be catastrophic. That was probably true of me when I was younger. More worrying, I think, are those who think that risking such catastrophes can be justified.

Briefly: I don't know much about the Spanish example - what I've read on it was a long while ago - but I would suggest that you're spot on to acknowledge the history of a more rural society, and (I think you were alluding to this) a mindset in which change is entirely possible, and which they had a duty to be involved in. Compare that to the apathy and alienation of today... 

We will always have networks of dependencies, that's what an economy is; but urban life effectively neuters an individual's self-reliance, in terms of the production of the actual prerequisites for survival, whereas a more ""peasant"" existence strengthens one (literally) and improves one's ability to form actual, useful co-dependencies with others around you. These are far stronger than any customer / supplier relationship, and a convivial atmosphere in which business is freely carried on with neighbours and tradesmen is far more resilient to hard times, than business between strangers conducted under the auspices of lawyer-negotiated contracts. (In my head at least! That's a tough claim to prove.)

I, like many others, happen to enjoy rural life. If I'm honest I got into it more for enjoyment than for ideological reasons. I am keen to encourage others to try to live a more sustainable, rural life. That's the kind of activism that makes sense to me. It's just not possible to convince the population of London (or wherever) that they'd be better off as peasant rustics!

It was episodes like Blink and Silence in the Library that made me start watching near the Moffat reign. Oblivious to any of the writers, including Moffat. Then season 5 came, and from The Eleventh Hour it just clicked.

It even caused me to go back and make sure to watch every episode from season 1-4 while waiting for season 6.  I've been going back, while waiting for the second half of season 6, and I'm really noticing that I'm just not that fond of the RTD era. I mean, I still like, it's still Doctor Who, but I've noticed that whenever an episode particularly rubs me the wrong way, and I look up the writer, it's almost always RTD.

His treatment of the character was, by far, the most like the classic era Doctors.

Their local budget shops showed growth.  Not only that but they actually ask their customers which ethical problems they feel strongest about - and then act accordingly.

Apparently they've just been awarded most customer friendly bank too.  The only problem-ish is that they're not on every high street but then they also do online banking, so no real problems there either.

Around when I got into Doctor Who, I started dating a guy who's... well, a lot like the Doctor. And I met him, and liked him, before I watched the show. He was adventurous, loved to travel, very superior but deeply compassionate. Having that idea of adventure and travel and experiencing the world invade both my real life and my fantasy life turned me into a more open, adventurous person. I'm less afraid of going places now, and I'm more aware of the fear that's there. I still have trouble leaving my house, but not as much.

Doctor Who also helped me make peace with the worst in myself. I'm a lot like the Doctor. I'm compassionate, chaotic, educated, fun-loving.. but I'm just as arrogant and deceptive, especially self-deceiving, even selfish, as the tenth Doctor is. I needed to see someone like myself become what he did to make peace with myself. I needed to see the Eleventh Doctor be so much more cheerful, somehow so honest and yet more delicate, at once to realize that I could be better too.

The show also helped me make sense of my feelings about violence. I was a pacifist as a child, even as I took in very violent cartoons and comics. I grew away from that as I got older, but I still felt guilt for preparing to defend myself/ actually protecting other people. Doctor Who makes me feel better about my ideas about violence as a last resort.

I agree with the op though, I really think we need only one signing. Ramires has now had a season to adjust to the prem, mikel should be right about at that stage where he should be ready to step his game up, and if lampard and benayoun stay healthy with mceachran getting games in we are not in bad shape at all. 

I was really impressed this preseason with McEachran's decision making and influence on the midfield. I knew he already had composure and good passing skills but on top of that, he seemed to know when to keep the ball, when to spread the ball, when to make a give and go, and when to start a killer run.

I have also heard that AVB has first team plans for Romeu so depending on how he adjusts that will be a place. 

I'm thinking maybe kakuta could use another loan, but I prefer it to be only 6 months and to a team that suits his style better. Maybe he can go to bolton with lee out, or wigan who play with a pretty open attack, and now have lost nzogbia. With the ACN this year he shouldn't go out the whole.

true,[deleted],null,null,"I got into the show during the Davies years, so I've come to expect story-lines that can almost instantly go from light and fun to dark and emotional. I think the show has lost a little bit of that. (That's my opinion though. I know I've definitely enjoyed it less since Moffat took over).

I disagree with the article - I actually think the show has gotten too light and goofy (Matt Smith does the humour well, but Karen Gillan either comes off as just flat or cheesy, which sends the show's comedic momentum over-the-top). The dark, moody plot lines from the Davies era are gone, replaced by much more airy and insubstantial stories, overall. Sure, there's a dark/emotional episode every so often (""The Doctor's Wife,"" for example), but they're few and far between. In my opinion, Moffat is relying too heavily on cliffhangers as a major mode of dramatic storytelling, instead of focusing on the character drama that Davies used to guide the show. 

My other big complaint about the Moffat era is his treatment of series-long arcs. Davies *usually* did a good job of keeping you interested enough in a background element while telling the week-by-week stories (Bad Wolf, Torchwood, Mr. Saxon, and the missing planets). I feel like Moffat is trying to duplicate this, but with minimal success. By the end of Series 5, I was just *so damn tired* of the cracks in time because they were in your face for the whole series. The suspense and drama had just been sucked right out of that plotline. I generally consider Series 3 to be the worst of the Davies era, but the Mr. Saxon/You Are Not Alone storyline was still done incredibly well, and it led to an awesome finale for that series (the ""Utopia"" arc). Series 6 is a bit better (because there's a lot more intrigue about the overall theme), but I still don't feel that it's quite as good as the Davies era. 

With all of that mind, I do really enjoy Matt Smith's performance. He's clearly having fun in the role, and it's nice to see that. Most of my complaints have to do with the pre-production elements. While I don't particularly care for Amy, Rory and River Song are both great supporting characters. I still haven't been completely put off by the show, but I do think the quality has slipped a bit since Moffat took over.

true,Silgrenus,cyberman,Cyberperson,"Preparing to go down with my ship in an asteroid belt of downvotes here, but I personally prefer Davies' era over Moffat's. I'm well aware that the world has moved on, and so have I, I'm not one of those 'BRING TENNANT BACK' sort of fanboys, and if I want to watch Davies sci-fi, there's Torchwood. So it's not from lack of either. My problem with Moffat's era is that it tries too hard to be mysterious, or more accurately, Moffat tries to. Moffat leaves plenty of enigmatic teasers about certain characters, plots, episodes, etc, which does work some people up. However, they cause me to set a high standard as to what I expect from the episode, and so far, from 'The Big Bang' to 'A Good Man', my standards haven't been met. I thought 'The Big Bang' was a weak episode, that simply relied on Gillan's and Smith's good emotional acting, but was so anti climatic when compared to the fast-paced, multi villain set up of 'The Pandorica Opens'. Not to mention the too-easy escape of the Doctor. Granted, Russel had a few of these, but they were set up though, Rose's use of the Eye of Harmony was a reference to Old and Movie Who (Side note, does the movie count as old or new? I think of it as new, but that's just me), and the Doctor healing himself was a bit of a stretch, but it was a good way to use the Master's weapon against him. No excuse for the DonnaDoctor messing around with the Doctor's computer, I had no idea what they hell they had just done. Anyway, back to 'TBB'. The Doctor escapes through a paradox that needs to be set up before it goes in a loop, however, there's no way to set up the paradox. Had River and Rory broken into the Pandorica by fighting off any enemies, or something like that, I'd have been more believable. Also, using the Dalek as the final baddy just seemed weak, especially since the only good use of the Daleks in NewWho was 'Dalek, Bad Wolf, but not Parting of Ways, and Victory of the Daleks'. 

Moving on to the Christmas Special, I think we can all just say 'WTF?' Despite Moffat's claims that 'it would be the most christmassy thing ever', I thought it was crap. Flying fish and opera singing to save the day. Also, 'Time can be re-written' makes my inner physics nerd rage. That cannot happen, and is about as invalid as 'wibbly wobbly', which is also a weak form of technobabble. And let's be fair, there haven't been any bad Christmas episodes of Doctor Who, but the first two were really only to help establish Torchwood and Donna's importance, whilst 'Voyage' was to use Kylie as a gimmick to boost publicity (Which it did, most viewed episode so far). And the Steampunk Cybermen were pretty cool, and 'The End of Time' was brilliant, come on.

Then, onto 'The Impossible Astronaut' and 'Day of the Moon'. Now, as far as overall story telling goes, they were good. Well, in actuality, 'Day of the Moon' was great. The first part, not so much, it was too slow, and the Doctor getting shot and then having a younger Doctor come in was just a weak slap in the face to those of us who had fallen for Moffat's teasers. But the second part was gripping, creepy, it was a refreshing good episode, after three consecutive bad episodes in my eyes.

'The Curse of the Black Spot' was basically a filler episode, but it's my favourite of the Season so far, just because it reminds me of Old Who, a little quircky, a bit fun, kinda creepy at some times, just all in all a good episode. On the other hand, 'the Doctor's Wife' is a perfect example of Moffat's desperation to make the show mysterious. It was the worse of all the episodes in my eyes, mainly because Moffat, in charge of Gaiman, agreed to use the old TARDIS interior, the psychic messaging system and the fact that the Doctor heard Time Lord voices, along with the said title. Basically, a smoke and mirrors episode. Yes, it was written quite well, and yes, the acting was superb. But this would have been better off as a novel if anything.

'A Good Man Goes To War' was another let down. Instead of bringing in old characters who the audience can empathise with, he brings in strangers (More of his desperation to separate the two eras), whom appeal with gimmicks, like bestiality lesbians. Also, the use of 'Jenny' as another name was purely for the teasers, and nothing more. Furthermore, the fact that he gave us this huge buildup as to who River is, before making her the daughter of his recent companions, just shows how he mainly relies on cheap and enigmatic teasers to tell his story.

All this being said, Moffat's era has given us some good episodes, and some good characters; this new Doctor is so much more alienish, and really reminds me of One, Four and Nine, and the new TARDIS is quite nice, and there are some good episodes, like 'Vincent' and 'Pandorica Opens'. However, because Moffat tries so hard to tease his audience, I find that it puts me off the show, because I know that the standards are going to be too high.

**TL;Dr** I don't normally approve, but I've written a lot, so just this once. Moffat uses too many teasers that set standards too high for some people, and that leads to plenty of critique, and it's why I prefer Russel's over Moffat's era, although both have good writing.",0,1312246690,null,0,false,0,c29hi4l,t3_j5waj,t1_c29hi4l,t3_j5waj,1427420105,0,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,0

Clive Allen scoring 49 in the 1986/87 season (sent in a request to Roy of the Rovers for a picture of a Clive Allen goal, they published it and sent a fiver back!)

1991 - [Lineker scoring 4 against Wimbledon](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhdYOKOY9w4) Just imagine what could have been if Waddle had stayed and supplied Lineker from the wing..

1991 - [Gascoigne vs. Seaman](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0LZbyccHow) He was immense that season, especially in the cup. I remember him dragging us through at least 2 rounds prior to the Arsenal game (and getting sent off in the league at Man Utd at a time when we could actually win there). Saw him in a pre season tournament at WHL a few seasons later when he came back with Lazio and he scored a classic free kick then as well. Fantastic player.

1993 - Spurs 5 Oldham 0 (we missed our train and had to get a cab from Waterloo to WHL - the driver quoted us a tenner and by the time we got to the ground it was about triple that but he wouldn't accept a penny more than 10 quid - we got to our seats behind the Oldham goal with 2 minutes to spare and Spurs scored 3 times in the first 10 minutes right in front of us. Pretty sure Anderton also missed a penalty but memory might be playing tricks.

I started watching Doctor Who this summer based on the recommendations of a bunch of friends. I started with the Ninth Doctor, and it took me a really long time to get into the show. The first episode that grabbed my attention and made me want to keep watching? ""The Empty Child.""

I loved Tennant, but episodes under Davies swung *wildly* in quality for me--except for Moffat's episodes, which I found consistently gripping and compelling in a way that very little else was. There were some good episodes, to be sure--the Master arc was brilliant, and I loved ""Waters of Mars""--but then there was stuff like ""The Unicorn and the Wasp"" and ""Daleks in Manhattan,"" where I only kept watching for the sake of having watched it.

Tennant was *the* Doctor to me, and I was quite skeptical when he was finally replaced by Matt Smith. But by the end of ""The Eleventh Hour,"" I was hooked on the series in a way I hadn't been for the last four seasons. When Moffat, with his clever, intriguing writing, was allowed to set the show's direction, I felt like the overall quality of each individual episode went up. I couldn't name an episode from season five or six that came close to the lousiness of ""Daleks in Manhattan."" The writing is brilliant, the acting is great, and the show is really something I want to watch.

Now, to be fair, I didn't have any experience with older Doctor Who. But to me, seasons five and six seem to be *exactly* what I wanted from the show.

And frankly, I hated Davies' finales. He used Daleks ALL THE TIME. What should be the Doctor's greatest foe was basically defeated a minimum of once a season, and usually by just making something up at the last minute with virtually no lead up. The Pandorica had an plot lead up, and had more substance than style. Sure, no crazy alien fleet threatening to destroy man kind, or return of the Doctor's archnemesis, but a really solid plot with twists, turns, and a solution that had some lead up. 

aGMGtW, likewise, had a lot of emotional lead up: it ended with the Doctor having to face the changes he had gone through. He had become a bit of a badass, an army of one. But that isn't what the Doctor should be. It did something new, and great with the character. Davies' finales...never did. They were mostly just reiterations of 'the Doctor is the most amazing being to ever exist'. I mean...the Master arc? Where he becomes a glowing...God thing? *shudder*

It sounds like you're something of an [anarcho-primitivist](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anarcho-primitivism)?  My views on this perspective (as on many others) are somewhat mixed.  In some ways, I go the other way (transhumanism, more on the search for radical technological solutions to end scarcity than turning us into cyborgs), but I'm definitely sympathetic to sustainability as a goal, and broadly eco-friendly (but I'm suspicious of the more authoritarian and anti-human strands of green thinking).

&gt;a sudden revolution could well be catastrophic. 

For sure.  If one came along I'd attempt to use the freedom of movement it gave, but I'm more of an evolutionist than a revolutionist.  I'd like us to pick away at different areas of dependence on the State, working on non-State solutions to human wants and needs, and hopefully, one day, when only the shell remains, we can bring down the whole edifice without it leading to the vacuum and chaos of an unprepared for revolution.

&gt;Compare that to the apathy and alienation of today...

Yes.  There's no doubt that a bunch of couch potatoes aren't going to make very good anarchists, even in the most benevolent of circumstances.  And there's no doubt that any anarchist society is going to have to face up to some difficult times which will require a considerable amount of durability, self-sufficiency and pioneer spirit, even with all the advantages industrialism and technology has supplied us with to date.

&gt;We will always have networks of dependencies, that's what an economy is; but urban life effectively neuters an individual's self-reliance, in terms of the production of the actual prerequisites for survival, whereas a more ""peasant"" existence strengthens one (literally) and improves one's ability to form actual, useful co-dependencies with others around you. These are far stronger than any customer / supplier relationship, and a convivial atmosphere in which business is freely carried on with neighbours and tradesmen is far more resilient to hard times, than business between strangers conducted under the auspices of lawyer-negotiated contracts. (In my head at least! That's a tough claim to prove.)

Stockbridge and Dean Village are trendy, middle-class and very nice. The west-end (around Shanwick place and Haymarket) are business-ish areas but very nice, if a bit traffic-heavy. 

Lothian Road is very busy and noisy. 

Fountainbridge is a slightly rough area, but not too bad and good value if you're looking for somewhere cheap.

Bruntsfeild is a mixed and diverse area, with some nice quirky shops and such and is a bit student-ish. In fact, any area around the Meadows, including Bruntsfeild, Marchmont and Newington are big student areas. Marchmont is considered quite posh, though.

Holyrood is quite a nice area in parts, but there are also lots of old council flats around there, so it can be a bit rough.

Grassmarket is the centre of Edinburgh nightlife and is also a big tourist area, so it's very noisy and busy at all times.

The area around London Road is very nice towards the westward end of the road, but gets a bit less nice past the end of Royal Terrace Gardens.

Leith is a popular and large area. It's bustling, diverse and interesting. There are a lot of mixed opinions about Leith. The people that live there love it, but the people that don't look down their noses. Expect a lot of international communities, lots of lively revellers on Friday and Saturday nights and a busy road down the middle. It's mostly traditional tenement flats (like most of Edinburgh).

Towards the shore at Leith (also called Leith Docks, or Ocean Terminal) it is again mixed. There are lots of very nice new-build flats here, but it is also slightly rough.

The area around Broughton Road is quite nice. I used to live there. It's very good value and is quite quiet.

Near the Botanic gardens (Inverleith) is very posh and lovely.

As a crude generalisation, though: anywhere within a 1-mile radius of Princes Street is likely to be nice and gentrified, with concomitantly high rents. From 1 to 2 miles out are areas like Craigleith, Slateford, Morningside and Ravelston. These places tend to be rougher, consisting of old council schemes with islands of new-builds. Further out still are places like Granton, Corstophine, Sighthill and Liberton. These places are varied and you'll need to do your research on them individually, but I think you can rule out Sighthill off the bat because it's somewhat... notorious.",0,1312270344,null,0,true,0,c29jue2,t3_j6cfc,t1_c29jue2,t3_j6cfc,1427421204,13,false,Edinburgh,t5_2rffi,13

true,brass_neck,null,null,"www.lettingweb.com and www.citylets.co.uk are very good for looking for flats, although they are all properties that are with letting agencies. If you want to go private, check out www.gumteee.com/edinburgh. Try NOT to let with Grant Management. Most people will tell you the same. Most letting agencies suck once they have your money, but GM are particularly bad.  Best area to look are Leith, The Shore, Cannonmills, Broughton St/Broughton, Tollcross, Bruntsfield.  Stockbridge is very nice, though slightly stuck up, Newington, and Marchmont are studentville, Dean Village is really nice but public transport isn't great, though it is within walking distance of the West End. Grange and Morningside are slightly further from the city centre and are very posh, but fine.  I've lived in Edinburgh for 12 years and lived in the majority of these places. I moved to Leith two years ago and i LOVE living here. Leith's been undergoing massive regeneration in recent years, so while property prices are still reasonable, there's some really cool bars and restaurants been opening and some nice little cafes and such too. There's a stronger sense of community here than in other areas and there's always Leith specific events going on like the Leith Festival, and loads of arts and music events. Also, I've never had any problems walking home late at night (i'm female). A lot of my friends have moved down this way too, and there's certainly been a massive influx of professionals aged 22 - 35. In saying that, if you are considering Leith, try and stay away from Easter Road - there's a football stadium near there and it's a nightmare when a game is on.  If you want any more advice on renting and stuff, feel free to PM me.

Here's the reality of it: In 1992 after ten years of slowly degrading heart disease ( drinking, smoking, fried breakfast every morning, no exercise ) he received his new heart from a girl who'd had a bike accident in Scotland. I mean it was fun to joke about him having a girls heart. 

I always said at the time that it was like watching a worn out old mini getting a new Ferrari engine, it changed him overnight. The day after he's in a hospital bed listening to classical music, cracking jokes, looking like a completely new man. 

But... that's when it ended for him to be honest; the constant battle with immunosuppressant drugs to stop the new heart rejecting ( you basically don't have an immune system any more and you're taking a pharmacy worth of pills every day ) the endless extremely uncomfortable biopsies which involve them threading a camera and a miniature pair of scissors up through the veins in your leg to the heart and then snipping a chunk of your heart so it can be tested, the fact that you can't go out in the sun any more without covering yourself in factor 100 sun cream, or go near anyone with a cold, a fever, or an infection. And that's just the tip of the iceberg  

He always said he didn't think it was worth it in the end. 

But I guess it gave us another 7 years with him before he eventually died of skin cancer which, with no immune system, ate into his brain in a matter of days ( my mother said he was literally rotting in bed and the smell was disgusting )

true,[deleted],null,null,"Taking it one at a time:

1) I'll be honest. I didn't like David Tennant's Doctor. The acting was wonderful, and the manic persona was great, but the moral choices that Doctor made offended me. A lot. 

Eleven has a little bit of that manic-ness to him, but it's toned down. Personally, I like this. He does have moral failings like 10, but they're not head-slappers in quite the same way--they're subtle, and he reacts a lot better when called on them. 

There's a tenderness and a warmth to his Doctor that I don't feel Tennant really had. At the same time, his relationships with his companions are clearer. They're less tainted with sexuality, except where they're not, and in those cases, they're way out in the open. 

Even though David Tennant is older, I feel like Matt Smiths' Doctor is older and more mature, even if you ignore his young face. He's still tons of fun though. Most Tennant fans I know are ok with Smith, and some were even converted. 

Give him a chance.

2) The movies are set between the end of season 4 (Journey's End) and the beginning of season 5 (The Eleventh Hour). You mentioned Martha; she's season 3. So you've got the remainder of that season if you haven't finished, Season 4, the specials, then Season 5. 

3) Short answer: no. Long answer, there are events in the old series that have been retroactively declared part of the Time War. Basically anything with the Daleks. However, you will not see where it all went bad, you will not see the regeneration, and you will not see waht happened to Gallifrey.

Some plot stuff and the exact nature of the war is explained later in the new series.

PLEASE do not watch back from the original start. The pacing of the old series is much stranger than the new, and the newer the old epsides, the closer it is. I'm not saying watch backwards. I am saying watch 3, 4, or 5 to see if you like it before going back to 1. The first Doctor is wonderful but he is an acquired taste. I got through with a will of steel. Most fans need to be intruiged. 

4: I can't say Reddit's concensus, but 4, 5, 9, 10, and 11 are well liked in most places. 

My personal favorites are 11, 9, 4, 3, 1. 10 is like dead last of the ones I've seen, but that's because of RTD rather than Tennant, and my favorite episode ever is a Tennant episode. ",0,1312281588,null,0,false,0,c29ke6n,t3_j6hjd,t1_c29ke6n,t3_j6hjd,1427421465,3,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,3

But it only seemed OK to me because the loss was so close, and I generally found it annoying and distasteful. It's like, 9 was Denial, 10 was Anger, Bargaining, and Depression, and 11 is Depression and Acceptance. 

I really appreciate 11's Poker face, and the overall flattened affect of Moffat's season in general. In 11's case, it makes it seem like he's no longer in so much pain that he can't keep it to himself--that he's still hurting, but he can cope now, and he's trying to learn to love life without having something to prove again. But sometimes he forgets... like in AGMGTW. 

Actually, I can justify my veiw of Tennant's Doctor as immature using one scene. The climax of The End of Time really shattered any idea I had that 10 might be mature. I don't want to go into detail because of spoilers, but that scene really disgusted me. I know 10 year olds who are above acting that way. Granted, he was in a very dire situation and his reaction was understandable from someone else, but I've seen power rangers characters less than a third the Doctor's age face that down with more dignity. Heck, the 9th Doctor did a better job with basically the same situation. 

Maturity and whimsy aren't mutually exclusive. You should meet my Brit Lit professor. What a fun old man. 

I will give you that 10 is a lot heavier, but mature is not the word I would use to describe that. I would use the word ""traumatized,"" or ""depressed."" 11's a lot more carefree deep down, yes, but he shows a little bit more old-man resonsibility in his immediate reactions to crises, and so far we haven't seen him behave weirdly on the quite the same level as David Tennant, the king of FEED ME.

It featured a surprisingly similar character, a puppet called Mr. X who travelled through time and space in his ""Whatsis Box"" teaching children about history.

true,ephemerat,null,null,"&gt; What really stands out to me about Davies is his overuse of Deus ex-machina style resolutions to problems. I've come to refer to it as his 'Because I said so' attitude.

Looking at his other work I think this is much more symptomatic of Russell T. Davies' interests as a writer; he is focused on the emotional arcs of characters rather than details and his plotting is almost always subservient to this aim. This works brilliantly in more 'traditional' drama like Queer as Folk and Casanova (in which Tennant was great) where the characters' emotional growth and maturation is what drives the show but I'm not sure if it's as good a fit for Doctor Who.

Moffat, meanwhile, approaches writing like an engineer. His stuff is intricate and detailed and he loves to make use of the full arsenal of tricks at his disposal. The fact that he can also write pathos and humour so effortlessly is also a major bonus. Most of all, though, he is clearly a huge geek and fan of Doctor Who himself and this is what really shines through for me, his considerable talents are being used on a series that he clearly loves and he has managed to capture the spirit and essence of the show in a way that only someone who knows and cares for the material so intimately could. The show seems more fresh and exciting again with him in control of the writing.

EDIT: And to pick up on your Lodger comment: Yes, this was what I meant by 'full arsenal of tricks', he is wonderful at slipstreaming clues, ruses and red herrings, foreshadowing and clever details into his episodes so that his stuff bears re-watching and works, not simply as spectacle, but as a cerebral exercise. Right from Eleventh Hour with Amy's house and it's extra stairs that go nowhere (to an upper floor that doesn't exist), to obvious examples like the disappearing/reappearing jacket in Time of Angels he loves playing with the viewer and unsettling them while simultaneously offering possible insights into what's happening.

There was an amazing post on reddit a while ago about a pedophile who has never acted (and is certain he would never act on) his attraction to children, but hates himself daily, there is nowhere for them to go to get help. It's different from being gay in that acting on your impulse is actually endangering another human being, but similar because society has such a negative view of these apparently disgusting people who are actually in reality just normal people with a natural vice.

Actions are crimes, not thoughts, and although this guy has - probably wrongly - moved into a position where he could be a danger to children, has committed a different crime.

One thing that I want to get off my chest here though ( and it's bugged me for fucking years ) is that a couple of weeks before my dad got his transplant he got the call to say that a heart was available.

Step outside your world view and see that pretty much everything is subjective and your understanding of what is right or wrong depends on your point in time.

Definition of ""archaic"": Very old or old-fashioned.

Most drug laws are very recent, opium houses were popular in the 19th century. I'm not so sure about marijuana usage but I wouldnt be surprised if it was socially acceptable not so long ago. So, no the laws are not archaic.

Sure, oppose laws if you disagree with them, as far as I am concerned that is up to you to do.

For me he'd need to:

1) Prove he cares about the club by showing more fighting spirit and determination on and off the pitch. Shutting up (or sacking) the agent would also be nice, yes. 

2) Be more consistent in his offensive game; clever flicks are all good and fine but he needs to take more care to do the simple things right and not lose the ball as often. 

3) Add more defensively, though I suspect he'll never get to the level  of Mereiles, Lucas or even Gerrard in this regard. 

4) Bring his wife to games more often. 

I do think however he'll always be a ""luxury player"". He's quite useless defensively, but if his passing ability remains as consistent as it's been this preseason I think there'll be a place for him in the team, especially against the weaker opponents.

Simply put no-one should be above the law, not the rich, not the poor, not the politicians not anyone. It's a fairly simple concept.

There are perfectly valid arguments in favour of having drug use illegal, to dismiss them and disregard them because they dont fit your own ""moral"" viewpoint is absurd and trying to equate the ""struggle"" to legalise drugs to struggles against racism or homosexuality is frankly insulting. 

No legal system is perfect but we do have a mechanism for changing laws, and like it or not few politicians openly support the legalisation of drugs. If you want to change the law be pro-active and help those that share your views, engage with people in *honest* debates.

If AV had passed it would have shown that we are in fact interested in being more involved how our country is run, which is the first step. It didn't pass due to a terribly run ad campaign and apathy from the public.

Sure this 1000 member jury may not be perfect but that's not the point. Increasing our input into the dialogue between ourselves and our representatives is the goal. I think if this is a success it may reduce voter apathy and increase political engagement from joe public.

This is a possibility if people get a chance to have more a say and with only a 1000 on the jury it could reduce tyranny of the majority and make jurors think hard about their choices as they make more of an impact.

In the long run I believe this increase in voter engagement will have a positive impact on British politics, which in my opinion has way to much influence by special interest groups which don't work for our benefit.

&gt; Totally agree, but it does appear at times like the certain sections of society ARE above the law

I think justice could be swifter for some, but we must remember to draw the line between justice and vengeance. Several MPs have gone to prison and no doubt many journalists will soon be following. 

Should Murdoch himself go to prison? Possibly, but only if it can be reasonably proven that he hada hand in the crime. Loathe News International all you like but putting someone in prison simply because you dislike how they run their business and may have wrongly trusted other executives is persecution. 

If he's committed a crime, slap him in prison. Otherwise we have to accept he is innocent. Or should we have a new level of criminality? The ""we know you did it but have no proof"" standard? 

The UK is by no means perfect and I don't offer this as an excuse for inaction but I would suggest that you look to other countries and see how bad they are in comparison to us. It does show we are ahead of the curve and generally do a good job. 

By this I do not mean we should not be vigiliant against corruption but that the system can and does work in the overwhemling majority of cases. 

&gt; I still believe the majority of people in this country are pro-legalisation though. I think a referendum would be fair.

Wasn't the same said about the voting system and how the ""majority"" wanted something else? How did that turn out again?

I disagree with this. Of course he's going to disappoint if you expect him to be sprinting back to make last ditch tackles, because he's not that sort of player.

this is the real you, look at it - it's the decent human trying to survive in a hostile world, the sensible and considered person.  You're one of us, why can't you just admit that and drop this pathetic pretence?  Why must you perpetuate the systems which cause the problems you suffer, which lower the ceiling of expectations on you, which limit your options and suppress your spirit?  Why be a part of that?  why?  
  
Why deride someone for being a faggot?  do you know the connotation of that word?  A faggot is a bundle of kindle tightly bound, these are then lit and thrown onto a larger fire to ignite it.  During the hight of christian domination anyone that was at odds with the system, anyone that didn't silently conform or stuck out to expose a flaw in it's workings - these people were burnt, they were said to be the faggots of hell.

I don't hang around in Hoxton so i'm not daily bombarded with this stuff, it's easy for my to skip quickly over any tosh like tis, what makes you want to stop and take the time to say something horrible?  to try and stop them having their fun?  would you expect them to stop you having your fun? 
  
What is it that makes you like to insult people?  And you know that [you do](http://i.imgur.com/JQ0dl.png) - isn't the exact reason that you're in shit fountain and for some reason you think your only option is to try and shit out as much of the shit you swallow onto the people below you?

true,ivaat,null,null,"&gt;He's no worse defensively than the vast majority of attacking midfield playmakers.

Sure. But a fairly static attacking midfield player is not what Liverpool needs with the system that it seems we're going to play. 

&gt;Aqua was very good when he actually played in the 09/10 season, particularly in the last few games, &amp; had a good season for Juventus last year. 

I have to simply disagree with Aqua being ""very good"" in 09/10. He had an occasional good game, but for the most part he couldn't get the ball nor keep it nor do much meaningful with it. He was just too slow for this league, mentally and physically. Lack of match fitness may have had something to do with that; we'll see. Or maybe the pressure was getting to him; as soon as we seemed to drop out of all competitions and nothing left to play for, his game seemed to improve. 

&gt;Pre-season may be meaningless, but he has shown that he fits into the team like a glove &amp; is easily our classiest player. 

Into what team, though? Into our best 11 - I doubt it. As a substitute who we'll bring on if we need to restructure the midfield or solidify the attack - sure. 

&gt;I think if he's actually given a chance he will definitely impress this season.

I'm hoping so as well, I'm just saying that unless we've seen him hold his own in a high-tempo combative Premier League midfield battle, I'm not sold on him yet. ",0,1312305404,null,0,true,0,c29mj7t,t3_j6mii,t1_c29mj7t,t1_c29lli9,1427422472,3,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,3

I think the best spot is between Lampard and the deep midfielder, so if Modric can slot in there and pull the strings from deep, while being a defensive stalwart, that would be great.

I've heard doubts about his defensive ability due to his small frame though. So someone like De Rossi or Schweinsteiger would be preferable, although neither are realistic targets. We could also move Ramires deep, and play another creative midfielder in between Lampard and Ramires (I believe AVB has done this on our Asian tour, with Mikel playing deep), which might be more suited to Modric.

true,lordofkullab,uk,North London,"Good lord, are there ever.

I'm an American who came to the UK five years ago for a university degree, and stayed on after (I have about a year before I have to find a very good reason for them not to kick me out). Let me, if I may, give you some advice that I think is relevant and hopefully helpful. As some other people have stated, don't believe that the grass is necessarily greener. 

First, even as an American, unless you hold a second passport (and depending on what that passport is) or have a substantial income that you can provide evidence of for the 12 months before you make your visa application, coming here at all is rather difficult. If you can line up a job with a company that can sponsor you, great (you will be bound to that company for the duration of your visa — three years for the first visa, two after its renewal, until such time as you can move to a non-sponsored visa through a higher salary or prove yourself a sufficiently established person who can be self employed as an artist/writer or freelancer).

Second, and I can only speak to London in this respect, the job market is not fantastic. On finishing my university degree I was incredibly lucky compared to many of my friends and was able to find my way into a (paid!) internship within four months of graduating, and after about six months of that was able to get an entry-level position at a small company. It's a good job, but the salary is relatively low, London is very expensive (rent, depending on where you live, adds up fast and transportation costs are high — buy a bike, learn to cycle safely).

Third, back to immigration issues for a minute, it is getting harder and harder to stay in the UK as a foreign, non-EU national. In addition, depending on your sector of professional expertise, government cuts are affecting a lot of businesses and organizations (I hope you aren't in the arts in any capacity). Some sectors are doing well, and there are jobs to be had, but the more well established and impressive your CV the better. Rocking up to these shores with a degree and a desire, however sincere, to live here will not get you very far on its own.

Lastly, 'free healthcare' ain't free. You will be expected to pay national insurance (Social Security, basically) from the get-go, and taxes are reasonable, but not exactly low. As a percentage of income, depending on what state you're coming from, you may find them a bit higher. That's kind of a guess, because I've never worked in America, but do still have friends/a brother who do, so hopefully I'm not completely making that up.

The UK economy is not all peachy, though it is doing okay right now (partly thanks to not adopting the euro). The job market, especially in London, is very competitive, and both employers and landlords will consistently have the upper hand and the boon of choice to hang over you. If you accept these conditions, and are willing to navigate a gordian knot of a visa system, I encourage you to try. It's good fun over here, and the people are (sort of) nice.

Get your arse off your shoulders mate. The BNP have more support than the EDL and they too are a fringe band of lunatics.

That first year would have been immensely stressful even if everyone came together as a family. Barrowman's description of the dynamic was basically that he respected Eccleston's focus but had much more fun with/is still friends with Tennant, and it seems that the climate wasn't overly warm. 

Eccleston clarifying (retconning?) that his issues were with show leadership just as DW is taking on brand new producers, though? As planning begins for 50th anniversary shows/events? Interesting! It seemed like a small step toward an appearance, something that seemed wholly and utterly impossible before he gave that interview.

Ok so Britain isn't a Muslim state and any attempt at imposing total Sharia law is laughable, but, that doesn't mean that the people who want it to be true because they support it will realise the distinction.

All it takes is for one nutcase to read that article or see one of those flyers and decide it's fine to go ahead and stone his gay son to death because, hey, Sharia law.

We've already had honour killings and threats of violence in protests, not to mention endless whinging for various petty reasons, do we really need to tolerate someone inciting the people that would support this kind of thing to go out and start doing it as if it were the most natural thing in the world?

It's all good and well saying Islam4UK is a bunch of trolls, but the thing about trolls is they generally try to get others to take them seriously and their effectiveness depends on their target audience. Yes, they may be trying to incite the BNP and EDL and other bigoted groups who oppose Islam in general, but they may also be trying to incite pro-Sharia Muslims who may otherwise be considered moderate or peaceful into obeying Sharia law before Parliamentary law.

The Catholic Church can't be seen to be flawed because religious diversity in Europe, it's historical safe seat, has never been greater, atheism never more socially acceptable or tolerated, and nobody is as yet willing to directly challenge them because they could probably hire every lawyer on the planet to represent them with their vast reserves of wealth. 

If nobody's challenging them, and they need to be seen to be strong and steadfast in the face of what they perceive to be opposition, then all they can do is accept each revelation of pederasty and molesting as it comes and just try and deal with it quietly.

The way he keeps the ball is astonishing, despite his size he is almost impossible to dispossess, he is so tenacious and quick witted that it's almost impossible to catch him in possession- if you did, he would either pass it on immediately or draw a foul. I think Modric would be perfect for us. Yes we will have to overpay for him, but if we can get him with a fast, direct, mature right winger we will be in a fantastic position for the coming year. NB both singings should be arrange and completed before June 2011 so the players can be bought for a decent place and have time to integrate.

Faith schools, by definition, *teach* children about a specific religion, that *that* religion is the *right* one, and all that that entails. Whether they admit it or not, faith schools perpetuate the idea that one religion is right and the kids that go to the 'other' place are wrong.

Also, considering the way in which most ethnic/religious minorities are segregated *anyway*, having their children educated separately is insane, in my opinion.

I was lucky to start off my school life at a non-denominational school, though we had collective worship (sigh), and I was friends with children of Christian families, Jewish, Sikh, Muslim and Hindu. I think that's a very good reason as to why I'm the way I am today: Pretty damn secular.

Put it this way, would you rather have Essien or Modric chasing EPL sized midfielders? Modric might not be terrible at it but he's not especially strong, and defensive midfielders are typically much bigger in stature. 

His ability to retain possession is highly rated, and I've heard that the kinds of passes he plays for his teammates at Spurs are too hard for them to control. Maybe he'll be able to play even better passes with higher quality players at Chelsea.

You said you've watched him a lot, how's his ability to win the ball back? 

&gt; Oh no fuck it let's leave it till the last week of the window so we can have another awful season and remain several light years away from winning the Champions League.

I find this pessimism misplaced. A lot of our troubles last season came down to injuries. A similar squad two years ago won a Double, and that's no easy feat. A full season of rest will rejuvenate the older players and I expect them to bounce back to top form, especially Drogba and Lampard. Luiz and Torres have had a full off-season to integrate into the team and hopefully their play will pick up even further.

To me, that means redeveloping Anfield would make more sense because no amount of money or fancy new luxury boxes could match the history or the lore that surrounds the current grounds. But it seems to redevelop Anfield, we'd have to get rid of some of the houses surrounding the stadium.

In the States, they have the procedure of eminent domain, which allows the government to buy property and give it to private developers (yes, even private developers ever since Kelo v. City of New London in 2005). Is there anything like that in English law? What about supporters just buying up the property discreetly like Walt Disney did in Orlando and then selling it to FSG for a reasonable price (and lifetime season tickets, of course)? Regardless of what choice is taken, redevelopment or a new stadium, any hope of SOS or any other fans/fan groups arranging some kind of mass movement to get this resolved like they did against Hicks and Gillett?

With Modric, he's very creative and attacking, and can play from deep as well, but if we look for him to play as defensively as we normally do with our deepest central midfielder (comparing him now to Makelele, Essien, Ballack, even Mikel), defensively he just doesn't stack up, both in his tackling and especially strength. Chelsea have typically utilized a strong defensive midfielder in that spot over the years and I'm not sure if abstaining from that is a good idea, we've been successful because of a strong defense first and foremost. 

However, I think AVB has been opting for two attacking/creative midfielders in pre-season, with Lampard and Benayoun playing beside each other, something I didn't expect when he was signed last year. I thought he was more of a sub for Lampard, with a midfield engine/pitbull and holding mid the preferred trio.

It managed to provide resolution to the cracks in time plot, while leading into the Silence plot. The fact that the Lodger and Day of the Moon ended up being connected just made me more happy that it had some resolution, but not total resolution.

true,drb226,tardis,TARDIS,"Frankly, Humans have determined that we are the superior life form of the Earth. There are people that try to help protect other life forms, but the truth is that generally if we have a choice between saving a human or saving a _insert_nonhuman_earthling_lifeform_here_, we would choose the human every time. We subjugate some animals for food, others for work, others for entertainment. We cut down trees for our own purposes, destroy natural habitats in order to create human ones.

I'm not saying all this because I am a ""let's save the world! stop doing this!"" person. I'm just saying, ""Hello, look at how we treat other life forms on this planet."" We use them. We dominate them. We are somewhat kind and considerate, but in the end we are the masters and they are the slaves. Most humans, including myself, sort of accept this as the status quo, as the way things ""should be"".

So suppose we come in contact with some alien life form. This would only happen under two circumstances: we travel to them, or they travel to us. Whoever traveled is probably the ""superior"" race and would probably dominate the other, assuming the absence of some inter-stellar government/police.

I personally think that we will never have visitors on Earth unless we bring them over. We will probably be the dominating species of the universe.

And they use the freedoms that we provide people in this country with to further their agenda.

AFAIK UK law doesn't have a requirement for proving your identity when asked, so it is my understanding that you could refuse the test.

For legal compliance it would need to log each request, which is pretty much the same as keeping them. They need to log DB lookups like this to prevent abuse, it's fairly standard in all police/government systems. 

I assume the only reason they are not retained is because the machine is not sensitive to take a master print from. I'm guessing here, but from what I understand the first sample needs to be far more detailed than subsequent match attempts.

true,Turil,k9,K-9,"I think that humans, with their ability to think rationally and their ability to empathize with others, struggle desperately with the idea of how to live a healthy life without harming others.  I also believe that the idea of the self expands as people grow healthfully, starting out with the idea of the self (what is ""mine"") as just one's own body, then as one's family, then as one's local community, and then beyond into all other individuals who are ""like me"" and who share something with me (genes, appearances, ideals, goals, desires, feelings, etc.).  So the more we see others as similar to us, the more we are likely to treat them as part of our selves.

Most humans have moved towards thinking of all (or most) other humans, and some other species, or at least some particular members of different species, as being part of our selves.  So human slavery, non-human animal testing, war, the punitive ""justice"" system, and eating meat are even starting to become unacceptable to many people as they are examples of us harming ourselves.

But there is usually still, especially on an instinctive knee-jerk reaction, a sense that some other individuals are ""not us"".  They are ""them"".  And harming ""them"" is always still an option when it comes to taking care of our own needs.

But I do see things continuing to expand, and other forms of life not as immediately and obviously similar to humans, are being included in the idea of ""us"" more and more.

The article on Costa from We Ain't Got No History the other day mentioned his passing accuracy isn't quite there yet, so he wouldn't help us right now anyway.

Since 2003 (Mourinho), Chelsea have been a top team because of a world class defense. We still have that, and we have the players to score goals - lots of them. We scored 105 with the same setup we have now, if we can keep fit and our form is well, we'll be fine without a new creative player. Things looked dire last season because Lampard and Benayoun both suffered serious injuries, and were out for long stretches. If that happens again, sure we'll be screwed, but that's just luck. You can't predict injuries. Lampard, Drogba, Anelka, Malouda, Kalou all know each other very well and are capable of scoring plenty of goals together. Torres, Benayoun and Sturridge are all pretty new to the team and will add new dimensions to our attack - Sturridge in particular is essentially a new signing with his EPL experience and goal rate. Plus, he seems to have a lot more flair than anyone in recent memory - millions of stepovers and explosive acceleration. Very excited to see him play.

I'd be more concerned right now about bringing in some proper cover for Essien. Hopefully Ramires can continue to improve on his good form at the end of last season, but right now we only have one box-to-box midfielder. Romeu is not the same type of player according to what I've heard of him, he's more likely to provide competition for Mikel at the deep midfield role. Someone like Tiote would be a dream signing.

true,ScreamingGerman,null,null,"&gt; Ramires can fit into the Maka role and be that box-to-box midfielder 

These are two different things. Maka sits in front of the back four and destroys anything that tries to come at them. Box-to-box runs all over the midfield hounding anyone in possession to win the ball back, then helps drive the play forward. The energy and stamina that Ramires has means he's naturally more suited to the box-to-box. Just like with Essien, to play them in the Maka, defensive midfield role, is to really limit their potential. So a player like Mikel (and Romeu now, I think) are more suited to the Maka role because they don't really have the ability to boss the entire midfield, they just clean up when the opposition tries to threaten the back four.

&gt; I know that our defense is world class but I'm just worried that--if our strikers in particular don't find form--it won't be enough.

This is of course a valid concern, but I think the full off-season, and lengthy rest, for our older players will rejuvenate them. I think Drogba has looked very good and Lampard is back to scoring goals in pre-season, so that's a plus. Sturridge should add more pace and flair to our attack, and hopefully Torres can settle. Those are two new threats that should add something to the team, plus AVB's tactics.

&gt; If you look at all of the top clubs, they have someone who can beat a player or two and make something happen

No love for Drogba? He can burn a defender with pace or run right over them. IMO the best CF in the world when fit. Sturridge and Malouda are both pretty tricky and can beat players 1 v 1, and Anelka has the pace to do so as well. If Torres can get his form back, him as well. 

Modric is known for his passing, not his actual attacking qualities, so he wouldn't add to that list. Sneijder is basically either a United or Inter player, not much hope of him coming to Chelsea. Costa is just speculation at this point, nothing to get excited about just yet. Again, look back to the team that scored 105 goals and you're looking at the same group of players more or less.

I think I'd rather have both. If AVB wants to use Lampard and Benayoun at the same time, as he has in some pre-season games, we need more creative players, and Modric has proven himself in the past few years as well. We don't want to burden McEachran with too much responsibility so I'd like to have another option for the midfield. Plus it would mean we could send out Josh for a loan move, which right now is the best fit for everyone IMO.

Obviously with pre-pubescent kids this becomes something which fits into psychological disorder catagories, but that's because sexual and aesthetic norms are broken when someone is attracted to toddlers, where-as they're not when someone is attracted to a well developed 15 year old girl.

As a society we do need to grow the fuck up about all this. Finland has a great system, age of consent varies with age - if a 15 year old sleeps with a 14 year old that's not illegal, so long as they're roughly as mature mentally as each other.

We've discussed before about the anarchist rubric covering a wide range of belief systems, the only two defining ones being opposition to the State and to capitalism; within that people will adopt a wide range of strategies and tactics, and given our commitment to freedom of choice, it's hardly for me to dictate to other anarchists about which they should adopt.

No, when you notice (or are told about) a problem with an idea, you should bear the history of the idea in mind when assessing the probable severity of the problem. If the idea is quite old, has been held by many people, and is still held by many, the problem almost certainly has some plausible solutions. Because your intelligence and time are finite you will almost certainly not be able to think of all these solutions by yourself. If you are interested in the idea, or the problem, you should read up about it. If you are merely interested in winning an argument, you should just state the problem in its strongest possible form and consider the argument won until someone rebuts it (probably by providing one of the solutions you never bothered to read about). This is a good tactic, because unless the person you're arguing in is interested in the problem, they may not personally know about many of the attempted solutions.

I think the problem is one of too much self-respect, and lack of respect for the collective intelligence of everyone who has ever thought about these things before you.

This is our typical approach I think. Strong passing to break down a defense, and if they play too deep, we have the long distance shooters (Lampard, Drogba) to test the keeper still.

Going back to the beginning of season 5 and it's hard to say that they are the same characters we have now. Episodes like Amy's Choice, Good Man Goes to War, and even The Almost People are rich in character/emotional devlopment.

Just go back to A Beast Below. Amy was a timid girl, in love with the Doctor, unsure of her soon-to-be marriage, and still stuck, mentally, as the say 8 year old from the 11th hour.

The Doctor was still spastic, but was using it to hide his loneliness and pain. Notice that he was so quick to send Amy home after one mistake, and even when she saved the day he was still skeptical that she should have done what she did. He really didn't trust her, and only had her along because of the cracks. Contrast that with him raising an entire army just to get her back in season 6, and losing his 'cool' with colonel Runaway. Don't even get me started on Amy's Choice, or even just Rory.

Maybe it's my bias based on years of studying literature and writing, but Moffat nails the nail on the head in just about every aspect, writing wise. I don't mean to sound like I'm praising his perfection, either(as no one is perfect), but you mention emotional archs, and I just don't see those with Davies. Most of the time it feels like his characters are fueled by the same thing, episode after episode.

It's fairly clear that the only reason The Doctor brings her along is because he wants to investigate the cracks in time, and feels like she's a key to everything. At the end of the 11th hour Amy even feverishly asks this question. She bugs the Doctor about 'why me?' Until he confesses that it's because he was lonely, but then the camera focuses on the scanner that's showing the crack in her wall, hinting that the Doctor is lying.

Then in The Beast Below he shows his lack of emotional attachment in her when he wants to send her home after making one small mistake(telling herself to get the Doctor off the ship). He shows how little he actually cares for her at that point.

In fact, on that note, that's the first time she did prove herself. Without her The Doctor would have ended up killing the whale, and sending himself into a self-imposed exile. That was the moment The Doctor actually started respecting her, but still not fully trust her(notice in Time of the Angels he tells her to stay in the TARDIS until he's done).

There's a whole lot more to these episodes than you're giving credit, and I'd highly suggest running back through season 5 before season 6 so you can get a better perspective on just how much the characters develope through just the one season.

&gt;You're forgetting that this Doctor is 1103. We can be certain that he is that old...

**IF** it's the Doctor at all. Even if he is the Doctor, we've only got his word for his age, and the Doctor lies, remember? Moffat himself has stated in interview that he doesn't think the Doctor has any idea how old he is.

River asks the Doctor to compare *pasts*, not diaries. She does this in the Library (no Doctor diary), at the Byzantium crash (no Doctor diary).

Your 'proof' only works if you already assume that it *was* the real Doctor. If you assume it was an imposter, then your proof no longer proves anything.

&gt;which can very reasonably be assumed

&gt;I can't really believe that.

So, all personal assumptions, then. Not 'proof'. Thank you.

&gt;Your proof only works

What 'proof'? I'm offering conjecture only, based on the *reality* that we have no 'proof' either way.

**Edit:**

Just to add some 'proof' that the Doctor's age is far from set.

**Second Doctor**

Could only describe himself as 'something like' 450 years old.

**Third Doctor**

Described himself as being a scientist for 'several thousand' years.

**Fourth Doctor**

Admitted he didn't know how old he really was. However, when apparently 759, had apparently been with the TARDIS for 523 years, so was 236 when he 'borrowed' the TARDIS.

**Seventh Doctor**

Estimated himself to be 1009 when he regenerated, but admitted he'd probably lost count.

**Eighth Doctor**

Also estimated himself to be 1009 when he regenerated, but admitted he'd probably lost count.

Also spent at least six hundred years stranded on a planet by himself.

**Ninth Doctor**

Described himself as having travelled in the TARDIS for 900 years. If we take his earlier age for taking the TARDIS as 236, that makes him at least 1136.

**Tenth Doctor**

Said he was 900.

**Eleventh Doctor**

Said he was 907.

**'Older' Eleventh Doctor**

Said he was 1103.

Also, a direct quote from Moffat:

&gt;The thing I keep banging on about is that he doesn't know what age he is. He's lying. How could he know, unless he's marking it on a wall? He could be 8,000 years old, he could be a million. He has no clue. The calendar will give him no clues.

**tl:dr; The Doctor's age has been pretty much lost in time, even for him, and any stated age can be safely taken with a *very* large piece of salt.**",0,1312407303,null,0,true,0,c29xfib,t3_j7uvm,t1_c29xfib,t1_c29x5it,1427427755,2,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,2

So much important stuff happens that impacts their relationship--of course they need to keep track.  Because their time lines are opposite, they risk screwing everything up.  Example: if River thought the Doctor knew who she really was and let it slip somehow earlier on, there could have been catastrophic results for their relationship, possibly ending it and causing a lot of timey-wimey paradoxical craziness.

First paragraph on the page. You should probably read the article. It really doesn't support your point at all. In fact, multiple times, the Doctor himself admits he has no clue how old he is. 

From the 10th:
&gt;The Doctor's claim of 903 is questionable.

&gt;Just prior to regenerating, he stated his age explicitly as 906

This is the only time he has explicitly stated his age. How trustful is this information when ALL the other doctor's don't know their age? Him stating that he is 906, is questionable at best. This implies that since New Earth, he's only aged 6 years. Which again is impossible. 

For 11th: 
&gt;she said that the last time they had met he had been 908.
&gt;Doctor was the first to receive a recruitment envelope; this earlier version of the Doctor gave his age as 909.

Clearly contradiction. 

So, from the same article:
&gt;One simple explaination would be that the Doctor has, simply, taken to lying about his age (precedent for this exists in DW: The Ribos Operation
 
From Moffat:
&gt;""The thing I keep banging on about is that he doesn't know what age he is. He's lying. How could he know, unless he's marking it on a wall? He could be 8,000 years old, he could be a million.

Anyway, when River said ""it's against the rules"" for the Doctor to see the diary and he asks ""who's rules?"", she said they're his rules in the first place.

This sort of stuff gets my back up. I remember when this first came up and there were no reputable sources saying that domestic violence is covered. To double check I just looked it up. Apparently muslim divorces [are relatively simple for women to get](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khula) and are actually covered in scripture. The process seems pretty reasonable, if both parties are willing. One can drag it out, which I believe is the case in all UK law, but the only repercussion is the limitation on remarrying. 

However, an islamic divorce is only recognized in the UK [if it are performed in an Islamic country, which the recipients must be legal citizens of](http://www.solicitorsfirm.com/divorce-and-talaq/). So if they are getting divorced in the UK they use the sharia arbitration process which is identical to ours in terms of suggesting reconciliation then having 'are you sure' periods etc before proceeding with the actual divorce under standard UK laws. 

[This article](http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/belief/2011/jun/22/sharia-bill-lady-cox) says that a big part of sharia is ""obey the law of the country you are in"". It seems to be in response to the articles you have been reading. In terms of arbitration contracts, it appears to be used mostly for the non-payment of debts etc in business. 
 
Most importantly, the reason this form of arbitration exists is because you and I might want to settle a dispute with rock-scissor-paper at dawn while wearing rabbit costumes. Anyone is free to settle civil matters in any way they see fit. To deny that right would be more damaging than allowing some of the more retarded options. In fact, it would completely screw up those who cannot keep up debt repayments, as any attempt to reduce the repayments would require a legal hearing. Frankly that would be insane.

Even people who started with Eccleston (like myself) think of Tennant as kind of the standard of measurement, because the show hadn't hit its stride until Series 2.

I could go on at great length doing in-depth character comparisons, but in general I prefer Eleven because he's just that bit less human.  He's vulnerable and curious and proud and all those other wonderful things that sort of define the human experience, but he's got just enough of that Otherness to remind you that he isn't a human and never will be.  That deconstruction, taking something so thoroughly familiar and tweaking it into something alien, keeps my curiosity continuously piqued.

Tennant, like all of them, had his own strengths and weaknesses.  I think he really performed well when the Doctor felt furious or vengeful (""I'm the Doctor and you're in the biggest library in the universe. . ."") but Smith is more believable as the eccentric wanderer and spacegeek with insatiable curiosity.

The one specific comparison I want to make between the ""modern Three"" is how they behave in regards to the Last Great Time War.

It also didn't hurt matters for him that quite a lot of folks found him rather attractive and admired his grand, stage-borne approach to acting -- Tennant always seems to play to the back of the balcony, whereas Smith is rather subtler, playing to you sitting right there in front of him, just across the room from your telly.

As a Whovian of the olde-skoole, having started with Four, backtracking to Three, then Five and eventually losing touch, I never quite warmed up to Ten enough to feel so drawn in that I had to catch up with all his episodes, and I still haven't bothered yet. To me, he was an entertaining and fine actor obviously having a grand old time *playing* the Doctor, and it was great knowing the character was back, but it wasn't until Smith came along that I had the sense that the guy I'm watching *really is* the Doctor, that very same guy I knew from days of yore.

Arguably, the iron was hot last year when we had Cl football to offer.

true,drwormtmbg,flair5,,"I like that you are not big on Crouch, and to an extent I agree with you.  The thing is that 'Arry really fuckin likes him.  And would be 'Arry's first choice right now.  Also, last year he did well in the Champs League (bar the RM game).  If we actually want to do well in the Europa League (I'm not sure if 'Arry does, and I'm not sure if I do either),  I honestly think Crouch would kill it.  Pav has a certain amount of height and what not, as well, but not always the intelligence or desire to get in the right places to do the Crouch job.  


Also, I think we can all agree that 'Arry sucks at squad rotation.  If we were to sell Crouchy and buy another striker, and use either Pav, or Defoe as a back-up, given that 'Arry doesn't like them.  It would be all ""new striker"" all the time and he would get ran into the ground; a la Bale and to an extent VDV.

Honestly, what it boils down to is that I think the best thing for the club in the striker position would be to hire Diego Forlan, and a Russian CB (preferably one who is friends with Pav).  I think that Pav looks homesick, and this has been the case with many International players over the years.  You really are best off to sign their friends too.  I think that a big portion of Luka's success has been the retention of Corluka, and to a lesser extent Kranjcar, and even the loan spell of Pletikossa.   If Pav had a Russian buddy his whole world would turn around.  It would be more like playing on the playground and less like playing for a team that wants to finish fourth.

As I read that last part back, I realize that the argument could be made,  ""well why is Modders willing to leave, for fuckin Chelsea of all places?""  Money.

Robbie Keane is a Spurs Legend (well...almost, anyways).  I wish him the best of luck.  It would be cool if he came to the MLS.

Defoe is decent, could be a decent back up, but I'd prefer that to be someone younger who could develop, rather than slide over the next couple of years of bench warming.

That said, I agree with what most everybody else has said about most people's reason for liking Tennant the best being the fact that he was their ""first Doctor"". In addition to that, it could also be that he was simply lucky enough to be cast in the role during a time when Russel T. Davis was writing some of the best episodes of the show that ever aired, though of course they might not have been so great had Tennant's acting abilities not been up to the task.

I love Eccleston and think he doesn't get as much credit as he deserves for the same reason that stoolydan gave as his reason for preferring Tennant; the show didn't really hit its stride until Series 2, after Eccleston had already left the show for reasons detailed [here](http://news.drwho-online.co.uk/Why-Eccleston-REALLY-Quit-Doctor-Who.aspx).

true,Iudicious,tennant,Tennant,"I was introduced to Doctor Who through Eccleston, but I really fell in love with Tennant. I always loved his world-view, in a way. The way he appreciated the great things about humanity, the way he responded to the bad. Tennant's doctor handled emotions fantastically, and he just seemed so much more like a person to me. 

One thing that stands out to me in particular, for example, was when he had just come back, and he was angry at the prime minister for destroying that alien ship. Tennant was really good with that raw emotion, and it showed, especially in the season finale. I very rarely cry from movies, and before Doctor Who, I had never cried from a TV show. 

I like that the 11th doctor is more cheerful. It shows a bit of evolution in the character. The 10th doctor was still affected by the same things as the 9th doctor, and the 11th doctor has clearly recovered from that a lot more than the 10th had. But at the same time, the 11th doctor doesn't seem as emotionally deep as the 10th at times.


Overall, I'd say a lot of the difference to me is the way the doctors have expressed emotion. I remember when Eccleston's doctor was angry with Rose for preventing her father's death, and that whole ""I picked another stupid ape"" thing did it for me. It was sad, it was upsetting and I could identify with both the Doctor and Rose. But I couldn't see Matt Smith's doctor saying something like that. He doesn't seem as affected by emotions at times as the previous doctors.

In some ways, as other posters have pointed out, that's a good thing. Matt Smith does seem a lot more alien than the previous incarnations of the Doctor, and I really appreciate that. Eccleston and Tennant were, in some ways, ""too human."" I really do like Matt Smith, and I think the change in tone that he brought to the series (with the help, of course, of the great writers) was a good change. Tennant is my favorite, but that doesn't make me any less appreciative of Smith's portrayal of the Doctor, and I'll be sad to see Smith go when he does.

true,supertramp1,null,null,"First off, let me say thank you for taking the time to make these posts. In my opinion your analysis has been spot on for the most part. Second, I'm glad you did these position breakdowns because now I see how truly deep we are at just about every position. 

* Goalkeeper: Fairly good, and ridiculously deep. I rate Gomes higher than most people because I think he made some amazing saves last year that were sadly overshadowed by his occasional blunders. And Friedel and Cudicini are the two best back-ups a team could ask for.

* Center-back: I agree that King and Gallas should be treated basically as one player. 25 games out of each of them would be fantastic. I too would like to see Kaboul get more games in the center, he played wide right too much last year, where he didn't look all that comfortable.

* Full-back: Wow we are loaded. I really hope Walker lives up to some of the hype, because I keep hearing great things about how great a talent he is.

* Center midfielders: extremely solid (and I too would not mind a Huddlestone-Sandro center pair every once in a while, I think Hudd has all the tools to be an elite CM). 

* Wide midfielders: Another position where we have plenty of talent and depth. I love it every time Lennon or Bale get the ball wide and are about to take on the defender 1v1. Gives me chills just thinking about it. Kranjcar should get way more games, he's a really good player imo and playing him wide left allows Bale more rest so he doesn't have to play every game fatigued/half-injured. I wasn't impressed by Pienaar last season, but I'll give him the benefit of the doubt because he came in halfway through the season. 

So pretty much every position so far I'm pretty happy about. Obviously we need to sell unnecessary players (Hutton, Jenas/Palacios, Bentley, Keane, etc.) but overall I'm pretty happy. Until...the strikers. This is obviously our number one concern and I'm a little worried that it won't get dealt with as there are only about 10 days until the season kicks off. For me, VdV is a lock for the starting XI in the no. 10 spot so really the only problem is finding a target forward. Selling Crouch should be priority number 1, it is absurd how awful he was last year. He can't finish or win balls in the air, he is clumsy and awkward, and he generally brings down Spurs' level of play. When he is on, it's like some weird switch goes off in all the players' heads to no longer look to play quality soccer through Bale, Lennon, or VdV (as we should) but instead just boot the ball near Crouch in the hopes that he knocks it down for somebody else to finish. BUT IT NEVER FUCKING WORKED. Okay, rant on Crouch out of system, now on to Super Pav.

Was Pav great last year? Not by any means. But he occasionally showed that he is a top player and I think 'Arry should keep a hold of him as a backup to the target forward we bring in. On a similar note, Defoe also has the quality to contribute, but not as a starter. His pace and ability to finish (2009-10 Defoe, not last year's) could be key coming off the bench.

Now on to the most important part of Spurs' offseason: a new striker. It's pretty disappointing that Forlan and Adebayor are two of our main targets for this position. Forlan is pretty old and I'm not convinced that he could succeed at Tottenham, but if we could get him at a reasonable (read: low) price around 10 million euros, I would love for him to prove me wrong. And the drama and high wages of Adebayor are two things Spurs do not need. If I had everything my way, we would get Fernando Llorente from Bilbao. He is strong, excellent in the air, and knows how to finish. However, I'm not sure how interested he is in a move to England because he is the star of his current club, where he has played since he was 11.

Other than Llorente, the only striker I can think of is Klaas-Jan Huntelaar, so let me know if you can think of any others. Again, thanks for the analysis.

true,JimmySinner,null,null,"I think that Nine was just lost, really. He had just committed genocide and he felt alone, I think he had no real sense of purpose but felt some connection with Rose, who also had no real sense of purpose. I conform to the idea that he went off on his own for a while after leaving Rose and Mickey in an alley at the end of the first episode (doing the stuff in the photos earlier on, destroying the factory that made sonic blasters and replacing it with a banana plantation) before coming back for her, because he felt like they were kindred spirits and he needed somebody like that to make him feel like he wasn't alone. As they grew together it helped to relieve his burden - to the extent that the Doctor dances - and that's why Ten became the man he was.

Ten starts off fairly cheerful. He liked his new self and he just wanted to have fun (he tries that again later, that's why he went to Mars). It's when he lost Rose that he became the melancholy Doctor. It was like losing the Time Lords all over again, because he chose to remember his people at their best. He and Nine never wanted anybody to die because they'd seen too much killing already, but before Ten goes he gets some level of closure on losing Rose, and he gets proper closure on the biggest source of his grief; he saw the Time Lords not at their best, but as the vindictive bastards that they had become, and that he had to stop once again. He didn't need to be sad about them any more because they'd proven his actions in the Time War to be just. That's why Eleven gets to be more cheerful, because the Doctor isn't mourning any more and he's not looking back at the people that he killed with rose-tinted glasses any more.

**TL;DR:** Nine was miserable because of the Time War, Rose made him feel better. Ten was happy until he lost Rose, then he was miserable. Ten got closure about Rose and the Time War, paving the way for a much less troubled Eleven. Logical character progression coming out of your ears.

------------------------------------

I realise after writing all that that I didn't actually answer the original question. Personally, I find that Eleven has become my favourite. My first Doctor was actually McCoy but I was too young to remember him properly so I consider Eccleston to be my first Doctor (I didn't see the McGann movie until recently). I loved Nine, despite the dodgy writing that defines much of his series, and neither Eccleston's nor Tennant's acting can't be faulted (although sometimes I felt like Ten's character was *too* consumed by his grief), but I love Eleven's nature. He comes across like his brain is working so quickly that his mouth can't keep up - that's why he seems like the doddery old loon, madman with a box.

A lot of people seem to think that Smith doesn't do serious quite as well as the previous two actors, or that his acting range isn't a broad or whatever else, and they may have a point but I can't really find fault with him as an actor to the extent that it damages his performance in the role that he's playing. He's been very good in my opinion, and I find Eleven's character traits rather endearing. I can understand why others wouldn't, I suppose.",0,1312445716,null,0,false,0,c2a1dkl,t3_j8ei3,t1_c2a1dkl,t3_j8ei3,1427429607,6,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,6

Watch Human Nature and Family of Blood, Season 3 episodes 8 and 9 of the new series. When you see The Doctor find what it is like to have a bit of the humanity that he's been admiring for so long... 
and then the fury of the Timelord... you realize here's The Doctor who has all of this amazing power, and yet he's met a set of creatures who hurt his heart... deep. Yet, the reason he was hiding within humanity was that he was being... kind, and only when these creatures take advantage of this, that they see this fury.
It didn't have the budget of the new ones, but there are some episodes to give you a glimpse of how deep and complicated the Doctor really was and is.
I believe Matt Smith is more than capable to show this, but I think so far we're just scratching the surface. We've seen from Matt a madness of the Doctor, but so far Arthur's Rory has been the only one to show real deep anger and fury.

* Cuter actor
* Less dorky costume (sorry man, bowties are not cool)
* More pop culture references
* Zanier persona in most places
* Superior wangsting skills
* Oral Fixation
* Slightly wittier with words 
* Morally ""looser""
* Romantic subplot with audience surrogate teenage girl 
* Romantic subplot with random, beautiful young woman
* Better angryface
* Shorter repeating catchphrases (Molto bene, Allons-y)
* Great monologues about goofiness
I counted 13.

Points in favor of 11:
* Morally coherent
* Generally apologetic when wrong
* More confident in his plans
* Adorkable
* Concise memes (""Bow ties are cool"" versus ""Wibbly wobbly..."")
* Longer repeating catch phrases (""I wear a y. Y are cool."" vs. ""Allons-y"")
* Less physically attractive
* More distinctive, recognizable costume
* Less accent slippage
* Appropriate balance of goofiness and seriousness
* ""Older"" feeling, comparable to first Doctor without the grumpiness
* No romantic entanglement with full-time companion (so far)
* Romantic subplot with an older, dynamic woman who has fair reasons for drawing his interest 
* Supports male companion more than 9 and arguably 10
I counted 14. 

Generally, it's a matter of taste and past exposure. 11 seems to have a bit more traction with classic fans. 10 is big with the young female crowd and pop culture people. 11 appeals to people who are more likely to go into deep moral analysis; 10 to people who are into more deep psychoanalysis.

true,busstopboxer,null,null,"I like Llorente too, but aside from his situation at Bilbao meaning he might be one of those one club players, I'm not sure about having a striker with so little pace. Don't necessarily have a problem with slower strikers, but if Rafa is the one playing alongside you're left with a real lack of pace in the front line. Think that would make it too easy for teams to push up on us when we're out of possession and compress the midfield space - not good for a team that likes to move it about like we do. I think this is one of the problems we have when Pav and particularly Crouch play.

I'd far rather a striker who would make opposition centre backs wary about sitting too high. To be honest there are a few about who could work but it's really hard to say looking in from the outside. I'm a fan of Gignac but he only moved last year, would love either Hulk or Cavani but they're almost definitely out of reach for us for now, as would be Benzema, even if Madrid sign another striker and would consider letting him go. Honestly would have loved Ba - available on a free at the start of the summer and went to Newcastle. We really missed a trick there. Have you seen anything of Dembele at Fulham? I thought he looked great at times last year for Fulham (scored a thumper in knocking us out of the cup too). I also like Caceido but he just moved, same with Gameiro, though he seems a little lightweight anyway. I'm a fan of Kenwyne Jones too, but he's another one that moved last year. Can't believe he doesn't play for us to be honest - we had a 15m bid reject in Jan 2010, then in the summer he signs for Stoke for 8m. He would give us everything Crouch can with added pace, power and potential to develop further. And Harry's worked with him before at Southampton. There's always Gyan too - he has looked good but I just can't seem to make up my mind on the guy. Could be ideal though.

And this is just a small selection of the strikers we've been linked with...

But I'd be perfectly happy with an older player like Forlan - someone who would come in and do a job for a year or two before making way for a youngster, and then still be happy to hang around the squad as back-up for a few years in the twilight of his career. Forlan fits that bill for me.

Honestly, it probably wouldn't be popular but I'd take Berbatov back in a heartbeat to be that player - he's quicker than people give him credit for, and him and VdV together could be really magic - VdV is a better version of the player Keane was a couple of years ago and the partnership Berbs struck up with him was awesome.",0,1312450853,null,0,false,0,c2a1mqo,t3_j8d7m,t1_c2a1mqo,t1_c2a1cfe,1427429726,2,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,2

true,ClampingNomads,null,null,"I thought it was a bit early for silly simons, maybe they're out already. Upland unimproved hill pasture (just below the point where the heather gets thick) is best for the interesting mushrooms. Ideally with the grass reasonably, but not too heavily, grazed off by sheep.

Edible field mushrooms are pretty rare now in most places because NPK gets thrown on the land, the grass seed mixtures don't help, and it's increasingly rare to get a low stocking density of animals grazing. All the old rustics say the same thing: we used to get hundreds of mushrooms over there...

If I were you I'd go for woodland mushrooms. They're different kinds, and tend to have stronger flavours. But be careful, either take someone who knows what they're doing (not some tool from the pub, someone who *actually* knows) or else pick a few, and look them up in at least two books to check they're edible before cooking.

The River Cottage series has a book on mushrooms - it's really good because it tells you about the edible ones in detail, with good pictures, and also has pictures of the similar ones that'll kill you dead. If you're trusting websites for info, use British ones, and at least three. If in doubt, don't, and (this sounds a bit heavy but is a good idea) keep an example of anything you're going to eat back, raw, just in case you poison yourself. You can show it to the doctor and they can have a good laugh before they nail the lid shut.

Probably the nicest woodland mushrooms are ceps (boletus) . Probably a bit early yet. Careful, there are some nasties that look similar. There might still be some Chicken of the Woods around, but you want fresh young stuff. Around here Dryads Saddle has been everywhere this summer, but I don't fancy eating it.

Thursday - actually gonna be awesome.
 
* Don't Be Afraid of the Dark: Probably gonna be a festival highlight. Guillermo has given it its seal of approval and a short teaser scared the bejeezus out of me. Don't watch the trailer...it will be safe.
* Final Destination 5 3D - well that will do what it says on the tin. But in 3D mother!!! (also I plan for us to already be half cut for this one...did I mention Thursday is a drinking day? because Thursday is a drinking day)
* Theatre Bizaree : I personally love short story horror compilations and this got an awesome review on a couple of sites I've seen. Short films means something to please everyone.
 
Friday
 
* Rogue River - looks like a disturbing kidnap/torture film. Will depend on the performances.
* The Holding: Brit rural thriller. trailer gives away little. Could be a tense affair.
*Urban Explorers: I really like the look of this one. Could be Creep/Descent stylee!!
* The Glass Man: I love Andy Nyman...that is all.
* Tucker and Dale: Do not watch the trailer - I saw the start and it looked hilarious but will be spoilker heavy. Will be top 5 for the fest.
* Vile: Hmmm. Saw style torture porn. Could be good...could be bad.
 
Saturday
 
* Troll Hunter: Hell yes. I am sure you concur.
* The wicker tree: it's the sequel to the wicker man....that film ruined me.
* Panic button - like the premise, but it will be very low budget/ Could go either way.
* Fright Night 3D: blood, 3D and David Tennant. That's gotta be fun
* The WOman: I think will be the controversial/disturbing one.
* Chillerama: Another compilation. Cannot go wrong. (also we will be drunk)
 
Sunday
 
* The Divide: I think this will be a standout - love the director's earlier film. The premise is also awesome.
* The quiz terrifies me. I have an image of a cinema full of nerds and Nyman laughing at me while I'm under a spotlight.
* The Innkeepers...I am intrigued.
* Saint: This will be a laugh.
* Kill List: I knew nothing about it. Then the Empire review made me realise that it will be awesome. Dakr, distubing brit-crime/horro.
* Detention: Well this just looks mental. We will enjoy.
 
MOnday
 
* A night in the woods: Blair Witch stylee? We all know the woods are terrifying. There are bears and masturbating homeless people everywhere.
* Deadheads: Zombie Comedy. I am excite.
* Curse of the Alps: Apparently the first ever shocker from Switxzerland....I have no idea what this implies.
* INbred: The title alone sounds funny. Will be a right splatter fest.
* A lonely PLace to Die: There's no sugar coating it...we will be delirious by this film. But I am actually really looking forward to it. a horror film set during a climbing trip. I'm thinking switchblade / cliffhanger.

If the alternative were starvation, you're right. It isn't. Sell your computer first &amp; buy some tins of beans! Rubbing it on your skin is absolutely ***not*** a reliable way of finding out if something's poisonous. Your skin and your internal organs do not work in the same way. If they did, you'd be considerably uglier. You can make a tasty and nutritious (and entirely edible) soup out of stinging nettles, for example.

Edit - re. trying a little bit - PLEASE don't do this. Frankly, most of the inedible mushrooms are benign, and just don't taste very nice or cook well.

But then with Matt Smith’s doctor within a couple of episodes he was already my favourite doctor.  I think his character was a perfect fit to follow on from Tennant’s.

But you also need to think of the writing each of the characters got. I mean Eccleston got some bad episodes and didn’t really have much to work from with it being a reboot. Tennant had some great episodes, but a lot of them were standalone episodes, with a different companion each season and now with Smith we have these much more prominent story arcs intertwining each episode with steady companions/characters.

They're completely different concepts.

Most 'Libertarians' are by definition going to be on the 'right'. Generally its about minimising the role of the state, freeing the markets and freeing individual rights. Capital Punishment doesn't easily fit into being either a Libertarian or not. Laissez Faire economics is pretty much exactly what a Libertarian is about. Liberalism in the modern sense is about social liberalism, not market/political liberalism.

Liberalism as a concept is quite distinct from this.

FYI [Thatcherism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thatcherism#Libertarianism) is recognised as a Libertarian philosophy, if you consider it a philosophy.

Obviously we have to draw the line somewhere when it comes to ages of responsibility, but making a law that results in death for not-killing-someone two days later... That to me is ample reason to keep such ideas from becoming law.

Also, the idea of a mother of 5 being killed and the murderer getting imprisoned, while the killer of a 60 year old unmarried traffic policeman with no dependants is put to death...

In short, he captured a wide range of feelings and emotions that I have come to associate with the Doctor.

That said, I now like Smith more that Tennant. At first, he was just a goofy genius. His doctor had relatively little depth as a character, and did not capture the emotions that Tennant did so well. However, more and more thru out the 5th and 6th series, and *especially* in ""A Good Man Goes To War"", Smith showed both sorrow and anger very well. He portrayed the Doctor as a man still burdened by his impossible choice, but he has accepted it, and while it is impossible to move on from something like that, he is, as you say, maudlin and mournful.

Also, the specials with Tennant after the 4th season somewhat turned me against him.

It only makes sense for the government to legitimize the business and prioritize the safety of the population, whilest taxing and regulating it like alcohol/tobacco and taking the money away from the bad people who have the opportunity to make money while being dishonest, killing, stealing and being a threat to society.

If you want to talk about drug problems then it is wildly irresponsible to keep tobacco and alcohol illegal as they are incredibly dangerous too. Opium and Heroin has always had a history of abuse in the human population, and the likelyness of it is is that that's how it's going to stay. The best course of action is to treat dependence as a medical issue, not a criminal one. Inform the population of the dangers of Heroin, Meth and Cocaine in particular (oh wait aren't they already doing this?). Legalising a dangerous drug isn't going to make people think it's suddenly okay to use them.

Just thought i'd throw in there that opium use in the past was only used by a fringe of society as a whole (well, not counting china - but there are reasons for that) , and that is exactly how it has been with heroin, and most likely how it will continue to be.

true,interfail,cnty-uk,United Kingdom,"The problem is availability. Could you get your hands on heroin? I sure as fuck couldn't without a lot of seriously awkward conversations. I would have little more luck attempting to get meth. The majority of the nation simply has no exposure to these drugs. While it may not be the only thing stopping me or you from taking them, I consider it to be a grave folly to suggest that those who are unexposed can be assumed to be uninterested.

When combined with their extremely addictive nature, I remain convinced that allowing the general populace easy access to these substances would seriously increase the damage that they cause.

Drugs like marijuana do not have an availability problem. Most everyone in the country knows someone they could ask. One would not even have an insignificant hit rate just walking around a pub asking people for a dealer's number. Ecstasy is openly available in some night clubs.

Tobacco and alcohol are certainly dangerous. However, prohibition is essentially impossible. Both do horrible things to you over long periods of time. However, neither have effects on an unrestricted user as dramatic as meth or heroin: this is why they were both considered healthy for long enough to become as entrenched in society as they are.

Criminalising drug users has always been a problem. Any review of drug law should start with a Portuguese style decriminalisation of possession. I do not think that it is reasonable to suggest that the government should not be able to ban substances, when their medical and social (unemployment and crime) costs are born by the government. There must be a line in the sand. I just think it's the wrong place.

Where that line should be, however, is a more interesting debate. Meth and Heroin should be off the table. Legalisation of cocaine is appealing due to its availability but exacerbating the medical and social issues caused by crack is a serious concern. It would also likely cause large damage to foreign policy efforts.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt; Democracy doesn't mean (and I struggle to think of a historical exception to this) that each law reflects what the majority want that law to be. It just means that the laws are made and maintained by people who are voted into the position of being allowed to make laws.

All you've done here is identify the most apparent criticism of direct democracy — which, in its purest form, does equate to the majority rule you describe — and describe the system of representative democracy currently in use in many developed countries.

Direct democracy *has* existed in the past (Ancient Athens springs to mind) and continues to exist at various levels of government in many countries today. On many issues the majority does indeed rule, and if there is a system in which the majority *doesn't* rule, how do you think that system was decided upon? Probably majority rule.

&gt; But if a majority (even a sufficiently large minority) of people really really cared about bringing back the death penalty, to the extent of not caring about other things in comparison, they could of course vote in politicians (or compel the current crop) to bring it back. But just showing &gt;50% of people want the death penalty wouldn't make not having it undemocratic.

This is one of the fundamental drawbacks of representative democracy. When voting for representatives, individuals are forced to choose between different 'bundles' of views on issues. Candidate A may best reflect my views on gun control, but Candidate B best reflects my views on abortion rights, for example.

No two people share *exactly* the same views on every single issue of political salience, so no citizen will ever have their views fully represented in a system of representative democracy.

The system is at its least undesirable, however, when we base our votes on the issues that matter *most* to us; economic policy, for example.

The problem here is that the issue of capital punishment is not one of these issues that voters tend to prioritise. Having work and being able to put food on the table is a daily concern for most, but criminals not facing capital punishment doesn't affect the overwhelming majority of people on a daily basis.

Nevertheless, it *is* an issue that people have strong views on, and surely you must be able to see the absurdity in a majority of a population holding a particular view on the issue, in opposition to the view instantiated in law, and their representatives in government refusing to so much as *debate* the issue?",0,1312474903,null,0,false,0,c2a3pj0,t3_j8m72,t1_c2a3pj0,t1_c2a2s9l,1427430778,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

When you're fully addicted the feeling of running out is horrendous, it leaves you feeling like a barren wasteland and the only thing that can compensate is alcohol and if you don't have that it's fucking hell. I've had mornings when I'm literally begging the shop downstairs to open just so I can buy a few cans of lager and neck them. 

I never asked for shit like this in my life, but as I said these moments are now few and far between. 

Actually I've gotta stop talking about this, sorry. My brain is now trying to work out angles on how I can get some and that's not a good look. 

So I'm out of this thread.

Granted, but these are the results of polls by independent research organisations, not people with agendas. The questions will likely have been of the sort: ""Do you support capital punishment for convicted murderers?"" Simple.

&gt; As consequence we have reasonable doubt and a jury system, amongst other things, to try and balance the justice system.

The argument against capital punishment you alluded to, which I referred to as the ""perfectionist critique"", is that our justice system is fallible. As such, the argument follows, we should not permit the killing of human beings convicted by our justice system, as it may result in the killing of innocent people.

The relevant *reductio ad absurdum*, as it were, is that the same argument could be used against almost any punishment prescribed by our justice system. If we cannot sentence convicted individuals to death on the grounds that they may have been wrongfully convicted, how can we send them to jail?

Where is the meaningful difference between taking away a person's freedom by sending them to jail, and killing that person, such that our justice system is fit for prescribing one but not the other?

In the 11th hour we learn that Amy is still a scared little child, clinging onto her childhood memory of the Doctor. She's afraid of growing up, and runs away with the Doctor. That's all from the first episode. You can tell this from her interactions with the Doctor at the end(and as the Doctor says, she still has that accent). And then the camera goes back to her room, pans across all the toys she has of the Doctor that she not only still has, but still has them out(how many childhood toys do you keep laying out in your room?)and then finally shows her wedding dress.

Then The Beast Below further expands on this.  Things like wanting to see her marital status, her timid behavior, and even her childlike behavior at times.

So much character gets shown in just about every episode, I'd say even more than the RTD era where most episodes just had them saving the day.

If you are hanged and it was found you were wrongly convicted then what?

That's the obvious counter-argument; capital punishment is final, whereas a custodial sentence can be cut short if a conviction is overturned.

The killing of an innocent man is obviously unacceptable, but does your distinction between this and a custodial sentence prescribed by an imperfect justice system make the latter acceptable?

In order to proceed from this point, we need to evaluate some pretty fundamental moral precepts. Both punishments constitute violations of fundamental human rights — when prescribed to an innocent person, at least. The question is whether a person can ever be adequately compensated for a violation of such rights.

Based on your comment, you are arguing for the affirmative. An innocent man having his freedom taken away from him by means of a custodial sentence can be 'made right' by means of financial compensation.

But what of the man who renounces materialism and is only insulted by the offer of financial compensation? How can this man ever be adequately compensated for the improper violation of his human rights?
