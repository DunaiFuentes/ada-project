true,Axius,uk,United Kingdom,"I didn't mean to specifically imply you were pro-dates. It was more a case that I think the current system is flawed because for every year prior to University study of the subject, the focus is stuck on the details with no room to move or develop analytical skills.

Coverage is a funny issue because the more there is, the less depth there tends to be given. This is largely due to the nature of exams and the curriculum - I think History as a subject should be a lot less exam based and much more coursework, as it serves the subject better and would allow for more expressive work rather than the current 'checklist of facts'.

I haven't studied Scotland in the 18th and 19th Century yet. It's been a topic I'd like to see, since things such as the Poor Law didn't hit Scotland until after the struggle to implement it in England. 

I didn't list off everything about the 18th and 19th Centuries but the invention of the concept of Marxism is rooted more in Europe. The Communist Manifesto for example was inspired by the German revolutions of 1848, and while obviously not the defining concept of Marxism, I feel that it's essential to see Britain's place within Europe as highly influential rather than Britain alone. 

Another example - the French revolution and the anti-revolutionary feelings this instilled in governments throughout Europe. Influences like this are missed if you make a UK-centric History.

I do think that you missed my point about Britishness. I don't mean it in a sense of a national myth - I mean it as in the creation of a national concept of the self-awareness of being an inhabitant of the British Isles and the associated 'strings' this brings. The World Wars probably accelerated nationalism more than any legislation could have with regards to this, the whole 'Us vs Them' thing with propaganda appealing to the nationalistic consciousness of the British people.

The study of what it means to have a consciousness of being 'British' isn't nationalistic in a self-pride way but is more rooted in 'what exactly is it that makes us feel we're not European, despite the ties to Europe'. It's interesting, very theoretical and hard to pin down, but works well with the study of things like the working class consciousness. If you wanted to study the history of society at a time period and the motives and drives behind legislation, there are a multitude of things you could look at.

I can tell you find the 18th and 19th Centuries more interesting, and that's fine. You're not wrong for doing that. I don't have the wrong perception per se of the older centuries, I just haven't found anything yet I want to specifically research and read up on, so my knowledge of the nuances of the period are rather limited. There'll be people who think the C18 - C20 period are totally irrelevant and there is more to be seen in the C12 - C13 with regards to history. People have their own interests.

I think British history on its own has value, but I do still feel that it is only more important when taken against the backdrop of European events and influences.",0,1295601330,null,0,false,0,c1dm8hw,t3_f5om4,t1_c1dm8hw,t1_c1dk7xk,1426708868,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

There is a healthy scepticism of people who follow that faith in the same way that there is a healthy scepticism of people that follow christianity. It is a simple human judgement that people who follow these faiths are not rational and are not interested in evidence based learning.

That's no bad thing. It's a shame that some muslims feel that they need to respond to the scepticism that's directed towards them.

As rightly said, Jimmy Carr's jokes worked very well, which surprised me as I thought he'd just be dragging his stand-up stuff into a live audience.

Lauren Laverne wasn't all that bad, although her ignorant comment regarding Ed Balls and his wife was a poor showing, and her segment was pretty poor.

true,Axius,uk,United Kingdom,"No, no, I know they're not related. My point was using the example that systems such as the Poor Law were different in Scotland and as such demonstrates that Scotland deserves to be studied as a separate entity as well as part of Britain. 

As for the Scottish Enlightenment - it's not something I have come across, but then I have only studied parts of history pertaining to Britain from the 1820's onwards, very rarely touching into the 18th Century. It may be considered important as you stress, and it does sound rather interesting so I do thank you for bringing it to my attention. I can't really trust Wikipedia to convey the accuracy or significance of something, so I shall do my own reading about it.

As for the importance of an area of history, are you talking about in education only or as a subject matter? I don't think the importance of a time period is relevant to a huge degree, because who a time period is important to is already subjective - you feel that the Scottish Enlightenment is essential to know about. 

I don't know much about it - which you are quite big in pointing out in a rather detrimental manner I'll add. The italics don't add anything to your point other than an air of arrogance - but I feel you will find there are people who will be happy to argue earlier things such as the Renaissance and the impact this had upon the study of medicine is more important too. My point is - there is no 'grades' of importance for History, when you start to do that you cheapen the subject matter. 

I'm sure the Scottish Enlightenment is important, to re-use that example, but I feel when you start studying cultural history of other regions of the world too, it is less important to them. Certain parts of Russia, for example, will feel that perhaps the 1917 Revolution was more important to them. Different experiences for different people dictate what they feel is important.

I liked how you see them (it) just once with Eccleston.  But 5 times with Tennant???  And they are all extinct?  

And I'm sure we'll see them 3 or 4 times at least with Smith now that they are no longer extinct.  If we take into account the screen time the daleks get and have recieved over the years, the new series is higher by a few percentiles and is about to be even more. 

Bottom line is simple:  The Daleks are NOT the doctor's main enemy, nor should they be.  In addition, the dalek episodes just aren't that impressive.  You seriously think ANY recent dalek episode is better than Girl in the Fireplace?  Blink?  Silence in the Library?  

Yes, Daleks are awesome, but they are being overused in lame stories.  It's like the producers just want some cheap ratings hikes.

I wasn't very impressed with the arguments by the head of the universities. His central argument seems to be ""fairness is not met when the average working Briton pays taxes for someone to go to university for free who then goes on to make more money than the average working Briton"".

This argument seems to be easily overcome if you argue that if a person goes to university they will presumably be making more money than the average person, which will put them in a higher tax bracket and thus they will pay more than the average working person in taxes, ""paying back"" the taxpayers that paid for their university.

That is not even touching the big idea that it is beneficial to the whole of society to educate a section of the populace and not only a benefit to those being educated. Meaning: if the taxpayers pay for someone to go into the sciences and they develop the polio vaccine (since Dr. Salk is on my mind at the moment), society as a whole has benefited from that person being educated.

Sometimes it's six or seven, in one case it's ten (The War Games), in another it's twelve (The Daleks' Master Plan).  For a while, it was two 45-minute episodes to one story (Sixth Doctor).

For the first three seasons, each episode had its own title, but from season 4 till the end of its run, each story had its own title.  For instance, ""An Unearthly Child,"" the first story, had four episodes - the first was ""An Unearthly Child, the second was ""The Cave of Skulls,"" the third ""The Forest of Fear,"" and the fourth, ""The Firemaker.""  These four episodes are known collectively as ""An Unearthly Child.""

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt;Why was it Amy who could reshape the Universe and not Rory or River? I understand that River remembered the Doctor because she was a time traveler and the Doctor intersected with her life differently than Amy. But why couldn't her remembering the Doctor bring him back? What gave Amy alone godly powers to bring back the entirety of creation?

Amy didn't bring back the entirety of creation, the Pandorica and the Big Bang 2 did that. Amy just willed the Doctor back. As to why River and Rory didn't do it, it's because the Doctor didn't imprint himself on them like he did Amy. Well on River he had, but not on his timeline, and since he never existed she couldn't will him back, though she must have had some inkling of his existence to bring Amy the book on her wedding day it must not have been enough (Wibbly Wobbly Timey Wimey more like).

&gt;Why did none of Amy's Raggedy Doctor games bring him back before her wedding day?

Because before then he was only a imaginary friend. When River dropped off the notebook it sparked a 'memory' in her mind, and she realized that the Doctor was real, hence bringing him into existence.

&gt;If her parents never existed because they got sucked into the crack, how could she remember how her mom used to cut apples in Ep 1? How could she remember the duckpond? Why didn't the memory of her mother cutting apples bring them back?

She slept under the crack, everything that was sucked through it left a slight imprint in her mind. So her parents were still in her memory, notice that Amelia never says where her parents went, it's because she doesn't know and when she tries to think about it her memories of them seem to slip away.

Her memories didn't bring them back for two reasons. 1) Because she believed they were gone. If Batman wished really hard for his parents to come back to life they wouldn't, because he knew they were gone, same thing applies. 2) this is the most important part; Amy was able to bring the Doctor back because it was a whole new universe, she could, in this way, observe him into existence. But before she couldn't bring her parents back because they were gone from THAT time and space.

&gt;If her parents ""never existed"" how could Amy exist? All their memories and actions should be neglected in the universe. In the finale, the Doctor explains old Amy is still around even though the younger is gone because she is an anomaly. Does this mean that Amy Pond is an anomaly for the 12+ years the Doctor makes her wait?

The Doctor explains this to Amy actually, but it involves Rory at the time. (I think this was in the Pandorica opens, if I am wrong tell me) He says ""Some times people fall out of the universe, but they leave things behind, half eaten meals, photographs"" very badly paraphrased but you understand. Also Amy's memory of them made them real enough in the world to keep her around (woah there is a mindfuck for you eh?).",0,1295757533,null,0,false,0,c1du66v,t3_f7awm,t1_c1du66v,t3_f7awm,1426712926,11,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,11

His quirkiness and goofiness was fantastic, and when he got emotional, he displayed it well. I saw all of series 5, and proceeded to watch series 4. I didn't like David Tennant until about halfway through series 4. He's far more emotional than Smith, and less fun to watch. Tennant and Smith are two very different Doctors, but Smith's hilarity outweighs Tennant's melodramatics in entertainment value. I've seen half of series 1 now to get a feel for Cris Eccleston as the Doctor, and he's great. Silly and dramatic, a good balance of the two. 

1) Matt Smith. He was my first Doctor, and I will compare every other Doctor to him. He is my favorite. 
2) Chris Eccleston. He does goofy fairly well, and drama fairly well, but neither of them spectacularly. Having said that, I value his goofiness greatly. 
3) David Tennant. While I don't hate him as the Doctor by any means, he simply isn't what I feel the Doctor should be like since I saw Smith first. He's a fantastic actor and a great Doctor, but he just isn't as witty as the others, and he's so overly dramatic sometimes. Still good, though. Can't hate on any Doctor.

true,[deleted],null,null,"I think the unemployment is really just a symptom of the fundamental problem that automation is reducing the amount of human labour required, meanwhile outsourcing and immigration is increasing the effective supply of labour for the work. And so the result is high unemployment in nations with high costs of labour and labour protections.

We have tried to offset this by expanding the public sector to create effective makework and keep people employed, but this is unsustainable as globalisation drives down the corporation tax (and eventually all taxes to lower the cost of labour) as we must compete to attract the business of the multinational corporations, and so the nation cannot afford to sustain the unprofitable employment.

The fundamental problem is that a high supply and low demand of labour leads to unemployment for some and overwork for others, as the competition for employment is used to drive down wages and working conditions, rather than relieving the work burden on all.

As [Bertrand Russell wrote in _In Praise Of Idleness_](http://www.zpub.com/notes/idle.html):

&gt; Modern methods of production have given us the possibility of ease and security for all; we have chosen, instead, to have overwork for some and starvation for others. Hitherto we have continued to be as energetic as we were before there were machines; in this we have been foolish, but there is no reason to go on being foolish forever.

We should be able to provide all people with meaningful employment, and relieve the need for menial labour through automation and modern technology to end this waste of human potential. However, it is impossible to achieve this within the current economic system, as there is no incentive to automate work when it is more profitable to use cheap labour, and even when work is automated it simply causes greater unemployment and struggle for the majority. Instead we must transition to an international, socialist, democratically planned economy, so that the benefits of automation may be shared by all, and education can be provided freely to those whose current labour is redundant, so they may meaningfully contribute to society.

true,Axius,uk,United Kingdom,"I think the problem with the government's scheme of the private sector 'filling the gap' so to speak relies on a rather unrealistic assessment that nothing else will change bar the government cutting the public sector.

As we've seen, VAT and fuel duty rises have had an initial impact on employment and unemployment figures as businesses are forced to either absorb the cost or push it on to their customers - both of which may result in lowered profits as customers don't buy their products or the absorbing will cut into their profits. The net result of both of these outcomes will be money lost that can be poured back into investment to create new roles.

It's this which makes me think the government is taking a serious gamble, expecting businesses to employ all these people that they feel they can. If Britain on its own was all that mattered, I think it would be a plausible and realistic option - however, given that the government's pushed the line of 'things are really bad here' and there are alternative countries in the EU sector showing signs of strong growth, what incentives to invest in a supposedly failing country do the businesses have? 

Multinational companies would probably sooner invest in Germany or other stronger EU countries, for a few reasons. Most significantly to me - these promises the government are making of Britain being 'open for business' (a term I personally hate because it suggested we've been shut), should their austerity plans go wrong and they have to close the tax breaks down, the investment by these businesses will be deemed wasted. It's a risk that I don't think most will take.

I would sooner rather have the government encourage the growth of new start-ups in the United Kingdom.

true,vade101,eng-berkshire,Berkshire,"Tornado is cold-war era thats for sure, but not really 'long-range' in the same way as the V-Bombers or the B-52s are/were. They are a strike aircraft. Designed to operate 'in theatre' doing low-level, high-speed ground attack missions.

In the event of the cold-war kicking off in earnest they were to be tasked to attack the Warsaw Pact airforces on the ground - in particular by taking out runways (with Durandal and the ever-controversial JP233 bombs) and airbases and using anti-radiation missiles to suppress air defences.

They had a go at this sort of role in the first gulf war and took relatively heavy loses. Since then (and thanks to TIALD and the cheaper guided munitions) they're more often used a more traditional medium-altitude role. They are an extremely versatile aircraft in this role, being able to carry significant quantities of just about any ordinance in the NATO inventory 

Harrier on the other hand was also envisaged as a strike aircraft, but one that could operate from just about anywhere (short improvised strips close to the FEBA for example) which would make it much hard to take out in the face of significant aerial opposition. The Sea Harrier role was much more improvised once the Navy realised they had to switch to the 'Through-Deck' cruiser model of Aircraft carrier. And whilst they've been pretty successful they have become rather niche. 

Based on our current needs, with the RAF and FAA mostly operating in support of ground troops operating in counter-insurgency campaigns, the ability of Tornado (and Typhoon) to carry a lot of ordinance quickly over longer distances and deliver it accurately makes them a much better fit than Harrier.

It may sound like a good idea to some at first, but lets break it down. These 50% are not necessarily experienced presenters, they're not being chosen on quality, they're being chosen explicitly on disability. This (to me) cheapens their contribution, because even the good ones we will all know got the job because of their disability, not because of their abilities as a presenter. Meanwhile, able-bodied people who could do a better job are excluded from it in the name of affirmative action, a discriminative policy in itself.

The worst part of all of this is that there's no reason why disabled people can't present on TV. There's no real stumbling block to most disabled people from doing it either (other than TV networks' concerns about having a disabled person on telly or any special requirements needed such as a braile reader for a blind news reader).

I wish that I could offer a more affordable option for the full length replicas. However, I'm treating it as my full time job since I am taking a break from ER social work.

I note that some of you have found machine knit versions. Unless they've got some special technology that I can't find, it requires manual manipulation of the yarn every other row to make a machine ""double knit"" or ""garter stitch"" (bumps on both sides, as opposed to thing like sweaters where there are bumps on one side and chevrons on the other  or stockinette stitch).

I'd love to see a photo of the baby version! I've had a few requests for half-size and 3/4 size, and also make a ""book scarf"" that can be worn as a tiny human scarf if stretched.

I wouldn't call it a superiority COMPLEX, just a smug knowledge that their product is good enough for the world!  We get more science fiction from BBCAmerica than from the Skiffy/WWF channel.  The ""original"" British versions of shows are far better than America's shallow attempts to replicate them as evidenced by the recent ""Skins"" MTV fiasco.  The British version was far more believable and sensitive.

Is it because there are fewer channels in Britain, therefore only the better shows are chosen?  Is it that British tv executives know that their viewers are not going to be ""turned off"" by intelligent writing?  (American audiences aren't turned off by it, but apparently the American TV executives are, as every intelligently written show is removed from the air after less than one season. No, viewers, ""Lost"" was NOT intelligently written.  It was a confusing, boring, derivative Lynchesque cluster fuck that people still don't understand.)

Sure, there were ""crap"" shows made in Britain.  Several of them have become cult classics.  Some have been recognized for the crap they were, by Brits themselves.

Eccleston's reaction to the Dalek in the first series episode [Dalek](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dalek_\(Doctor_Who_episode\)) is (as far as I can tell) due to events that took place in the classic era.

I'm for developing electric cars and shifting the entire grid to a nuclear baseload with renewable surplus which tbh isn't probably going to happen (it's carbon neutral but there are a few issues with nuclear though it is much better than most people believe) but if you even refuse to accept that we need more energy to meet the challenges of rising populations and rising fossil fuel costs without a catastrophic decline in living standards then you are just closing your eyes to reality.

Before you respond with 'we can reduce demand by making everything more efficient' I suggest you read about the [Jevons Paradox](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jevons_paradox) as it's an argument I am just tired of hearing. Furthermore with rising populations the belief that we could stay at our current levels of consumption without a decline is pretty unrealistic too.

The problem is, without repeatedly stating this, on its face it can look like racism (and certainly racists will use the umbrella to shield their outdated views from public scorn).

The fact is, many people who follow Islam hold extremely conservative, illiberal and in some cases borderline fascistic views; and they hold them from a fairly widely received interpretation of their holy book.  It's true, that many Christians also use their book to justify highly conservative worldviews, but the percentages are orders of magnitude lower.  

The example of Islamophobia in the article is a case in point: ""I don't care what the good or bad Baroness has to say about anything at all. I give her no credence nor voice. She is a person of faith so in my book a skinwaste.""  It isn't even an attack on Islam, although the specific case is a Muslim woman, it's an attack on persons of faith.  Personally, I'm not such a fundamentalist atheist (indeed, I see the dangers of such radical fundamentalism in all its guises), and I believe the freedom of religion is an important bulwark, but nonetheless, it doesn't express racism.",0,1295866498,null,0,false,0,c1dz6kx,t3_f7zq7,t1_c1dz6kx,t3_f7zq7,1426715355,14,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,14

The vast majority of car journeys are simply not necessary. We'd improve the quality of everyone's life significantly if we ploughed that money into public transport and encouraging people to live closer to where they work.

We do have a problem with housing atm, especially in the South East. If you work in London, you most likely won't be able to afford to live in London, and even if you can it's a struggle to rent anywhere at the moment. So you can live outside London, but if you don't live near one of the commuter lines you can't easily use the train. Even just going from one town to another on public transport is hard in some cases, Fleet to Reading took 35mins door to door when I had to make that journey. But was 50 mins on the train, not including travel time at either end. I could have moved, but I was contracting at the time, so I would be moving every 3-4 months. This is all in a very high density area, with damn good public transport links (the trains especially), when I lived in the Midlands I lost a job because the trains were always late or cancelled. 

So currently, a very high percentage of car journeys are necessary. We can't put more train lines in without environmentalists and NIMBY's complaining. So the only option is more bus services, which currently are terrible, especially if you want to go between towns.

* Peter Davison - Earthshock, for one of the bravest moments in classic Who. Failing that, The Caves Of Androzani.

* Colin Baker - Great Doctor, but not too many good stories. I'd recommend The Twin Dilemma. The plot is rubbish, but Colin Baker is amazing as the Doctor suffers from bad post regenerative trauma. 

* Sylvester McCoy - The Curse Of Fenric is one of my favourites. 

* Paul McGann - The TV movie is worth seeing only for his role as the Doctor. Otherwise, find some of the Big Finish audio dramas.

* Christopher Ecclestone - The Empty Child and The Doctor Dances. An amazing 2 parter, which also introduces Captain Jack Harkness.

* David Tennant - The best standalone episode is probably Blink.

* Matt Smith - I loved his first story The Eleventh Hour. 

Also, check out the Doctor Who movies made by Amicus in the 60s. They're not canonical at all, but are quite fun in their own way.

true,loudribs,eng-yorkshire,2 'E's and some 'LSD',"It's a bastard of a conundrum and one that's pretty hard to solve. The two biggest problems are a) the benefits system punishes work at the lower end of the scale and b) actually, quite a lot of people are unemployable in this country.

On point a), there are two ways of addressing it. One is to look at how the benefits system can be made to reward work and try and run with this angle. IDS was making some promising noises on this front, but I'm not holding my breath as I can see the treasury defanging most of the worthwhile parts while the usually combination of vastness and benefits clusterfuckery will probably consign the rest of it to an early grave. I hope I'm being overly pessimistic here.

The other way of looking at it is from the wages angle and I personally believe there's more than can be done here. Basically, minimum wage in this country equates to a pretty miserable existence and one that often leads to a debt trap. One solution would be to raise ot (and I've been watching the Living Wage campaign with interest), but that's politically difficult as business will howl and scream that you're gutting the country (as they did when it was first introduced). Also, don't expect it from this coalition. They've already made their position pretty clear when it comes to business vs. everything else. The other way is for the state to take up the slack by using things such as tax credits which the last government did with some success. However, given the current climate, I don't see that happening too soon either.

Point b) is the really tricky one though and that's what do you with people who simply don't have the skills to work to which I answer ""I dunno"". We've tried things like New Deal that have had a margin of success but it's a very pernicious problem, especially as our economy has become so reliant on services at the expense of industry (which was the traditional avenue for those lacking in skills). I really don't know where to start on this one as it's a problem so vast it basically defies comprehension.

If you are not a resident of the UK or one of the designated European countries, regardless of citizenship, you will be required to apply for tickets via your local National Olympic Committee (NOC) or National Paralympic Committee (NPC) from 2011. Some NOCs and NPCs may appoint an Authorised Ticket Reseller (ATR) in order to help the general public obtain tickets and services relating to the London 2012 Olympic Games and Paralympic Games. If you register your interest http://www.tickets.london2012.com/member/registration with us, we will send you the contact details of your local NOC, NPC or ATR when they are made available. A full list will be posted on this website in early 2011.

The Olympic committee state if you are in this country when registering for your tickets you must use a British address. If you provide your APO address you will have to go through your NOC.

Not sure what this has to do with the Jewish left...

Since when has whether something is natural or not dictated it's morality?

I understand prejudgment on a situation, person or thing is an evolutionary concept which we can't help, but to link that to Racism being something morally justifiable seems dishonest.

If scientifically we can prove that the differences between individual ""races"" are less extreme than the differences between individuals there is no reason to take it seriously. Thus it is born of ignorance and unjustifiably hurts people.

I sincerely hope you didn't mean to sound condescending and am willing to give you the benefit of the doubt. If you disagree I don't mind arguing and am quite willing to change my mind. I understand tone is hard to convey.

* Doctor Who series 2
* Torchwood series 1
* Doctor Who series 3 (a little overlap between this and Torchwood series 1, since Utopia follows on directly from the cliffhanger at the end of End of Days).
* Torchwood series 2
* Doctor Who series 4 (again, probably a little overlap with Torchwood series 2; The Stolen Earth picks up a little after where Exit Wounds ended)
* The Next Doctor (Doctor Who series 4.5)
* Planet of the Dead (Doctor Who series 4.5)

true,syuk,ter-Sark,Sark,"I see them as a symptom - people can't generally accept that there are people who are not able or fit to work, I don't blame 100% of those on benefits for this. Some were let down with education, some had their 'cards marked' before they started out life as an adult.

I certainly don't envy people on benefits, although they might lead a better lifestyle than I do, I realise that it is not their fault that the system is so exploitable. 

I do however see them as partly responsible for 'the mess' - it is up to them to do something, but as long as there is work-free alternative and benefits are better than work then they would be fools to change - this is a catch 22 in the truest sense, if they work they risk their lifestyle, but if some have never had the enjoyment and fulfillment of work (if it indeed exists for some) then benefits are irreplaceable.

I in no way want to remove the safety net of social security for people, just wonder how it will work out when you have a girl of 15 who's only ambition is to get pregnant because she knows she will have an easy life. 

The more children she has the better off she will be. 'Aunties' teach kids this where I live. Uncles teach the boys other things.

The other problem of course we are seeing is that the focus on helping people seemingly shifted to helping children rather than the elderly with the green paper a few years ago. This is why people cannot get life saving drugs and have to sell their homes to be looked after in care.

Can I ask you, do you think this will not stop until everyone is 'equal' - the rich will of course still be rich, but everyone else will be equal regardless of their contributions to society? If so, what is the need to work at all.

I think the British public is ethically conscious about what is right and wrong politically.  However, as you say, it seems to be too easy for the government to just give the finger to the public and do whatever they want.  In the end, all what the public can do in return is demonstrate for a few days and then everything goes back to normal.  I'm afraid this is the result of representative democracy that is no longer accountable.  Whoever you vote, doesn't seem to be making much of a difference as each political party is loud when they shout at each other but in terms of policy just bicker on the smaller micro economic issues.

Personally I think the problem is not British, but there is something wrong with the very idea of the democratic system itself.

Once the story is out there, for example that a suspect in a murder trial has previous convictions, or photos of a suspect where identification is an issue, the damage is done.  Most of us, and I easily include myself, would struggle to give the benefit of the doubt or feel impartial towards someone on a serious crime charge if we knew they had previously served time for a similar serious crime.  

Yet each case is supposed to be judged on its own merits (there are some exceptions - for example prosecutors are sometimes allowed to include previous convictions by arguing a specific pattern of offending or modus operandi). 

The media (and it's not just the tabloid press) continually pushes the boundaries on this, largely because they are frustrated that overseas publications can get away with printing fuller details than UK-based publications - though foreign media organisations could technically fall foul of UK laws.

true,Axius,uk,United Kingdom,"The system is a huge mess which for me starts with the Jobcentre.

The Jobcentres are semi-neutered arms of local government that do nothing bar push the local council lines. In my experience, I've found they have next to no ties with local communities and cannot provide people with assistance in retraining or education towards work ends. 

The 'courses' they run are laughable. I enquired about IT-related qualifications when I was out of work as I have an excellent range of self-taught skills, but no paperwork to say that I might be good at it. The only course they had was essentially an hour long course on how to turn a PC on and off and how to browse the internet.

I've spoken to employers who have said they don't advertise at the Jobcentres because they end up sending a stream of unqualified jobseekers who can't remotely do the job simply to meet targets - the end experience is a massively demoralised workforce who think they're no good for work. 
This is one massive contributor to a kind of 'benefit fraud' - not everyone wants to skip work, but after applying for jobs and constantly getting knocked back, there's only so long you can accept the line of 'have you tried changing your CV?'. You end up accepting you can't work and just give up trying.

Much as people dislike the concept, the minimum wage is one of the few things that makes work appealing for people. It has a lot of issues like artificially causing inflation and whatnot, but people feel if they're working above the minimum wage that they're in a job with value. The current issue is that you can't really cut the minimum wage just now as you will risk some employers in the current market taking the piss and dropping their wages. Given the VAT rise and the general rise in prices of all goods, that would be disastrous.
It's on this basis that the proposals for a universal credit system have some merit and why I think it would be worth looking at. I don't think the associated Victorian-esque work ethics would need to be applied too though. 

The Welfare State is for me essential to maintain - the minimum wage is essential at least for psychological purposes and to ensure subsistence where possible. The Jobcentres need a lot of restructuring to actually become useful, and they need to drop the target-driven nature of them in order to make them advisory centres to be useful to people who WANT to work. 

We need to drive people to train up and we should try subsidise access to courses for unemployed people at local colleges - within reason. Qualifications necessary for people who have existing and proven skills should certainly be helped with. Realistic ambitions and dreams should be helped, and this could be aided with better links to local colleges and teaching facilities.

Careers guidance also needs to be available for people of all ages - comprehensive information should be available to everyone who wants help with working out their career. This could be tied in to the job application process and perhaps result in local businesses being more interested in advertising at the Jobcentres as they get relevant applicants instead of anyone and everyone.

Hell, they could go a step further and register unemployed persons on an optional database akin to submitting your CV online which would have your CV and all relevant information and what sectors you would like work in. Employers then could browse it and pick people they feel would be appropriate.

There's a whole plethora of things they could do to help the unemployed find a job. Those who don't want to get a job because they want to avoid working full stop are a problem, but I would like to think that at least we could reform things to be BETTER instead of just outright destroying them.",0,1295909859,null,0,false,0,c1e1rqi,t3_f83su,t1_c1e1rqi,t3_f83su,1426716590,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

So I've had to start again from square one. Go through the horrific applications process again (10-15 applicants for every place for Vet Med!). I got a rejection from Glasgow without interview in December which was a bit demoralising, but things have started to look up a bit as the last couple of weeks I've had two interview offers, for February.

* Glasgow - rejection
* Liverpool - interview
* Bristol - interview
* Edinburgh - silence since October

Now I need to cram to give the illusion of knowing what I'm talking about at interview.

true,Ryuuken1127,lfc99,null,"Frankly, I think the Champions League &amp; Europa League need re-organizing.

The Champions League should only consist of the winners of each club competition in Europe (like, only contain the winner from the EPL, La Liga, Serie A, Ligue 1, etc.) and then the runner-ups from 2nd to 6th place should go to the Europa League.

I know that would drastically increase the size of the Europa League, and drastically decrease the size of the Champions League, but that's just how I view it.

Now on to the point at hand:
Yes, it is kind of insulting that Liverpool is in this competition, but that doesn't mean it's an easy competition. Some very good teams are still in this competition (Manchester City, Porto, Villareal, Benfica, Stuttgart, Eindhoven, etc.). I think there are going to be some pretty good match-ups once the round of 32 &amp; the round of 16 get going.

While yes, you should have your eye on the prize no matter what competition you're in, I think Liverpool need to focus on making a Champions League spot in the Premier League table. I have very little hope we'll WIN the Premier League.

**The names behind the Bolshevik (Russian/Communist) revolution**

The most detailed description of Jewish influence in the Bolshevik 'revolution comes from Robert Wilton, the Russian correspondent of The Times. In 1920 he published a book in French, Les Derniers Jours des Romanofs, which gave the racial background of all the members of the Soviet government. (This does not appear in the later English translation, for some odd reason.) After the publication of this monumental work, Wilton was ostracised by the press, and he died in poverty in 1925. He reported that the Central Committee of the Bolshevik Party was made up as follows:

I accept it's partly the fault of Western media for giving too much oxygen to these types, which explains both their [toxicity](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen_toxicity#Central_nervous_system) and possibly our perhaps distorted views of what the average Muslim thinks, but they're Muslims, they're (mis)quoting your book and they're borderline fascists.

On the broader point, I'm very pleased to hear that both you and your country believe the right to abortion is a given, I sincerely view that as extremely laudable.  I hold somewhat libertarian views so I accept my conception of conservative or illiberal is going to be broader than most, and I'd certain not expect every moderate to be advocating the legalization of heroin, but how do your and fellow Muslims you associate with stack up on the rest of my markers of liberalism?  We've established your pro-choice credentials, but are you and your compatriots mostly pro-gay rights, pro-feminist, anti-prohibition of alcohol(*) and pro-interracial/faith relationships?

All the Muslims I have known very well have been from Britain, but I've known in passing Muslims from Lebanon, Malaysia, Singapore, and Indonesia.  On balance I would say that those from the Lebanon were the most liberal in their outlook, followed by those from Singapore. 

(*) Clearly, I'm meaning for non and non-practising Muslims, on the assumption that people can leave the faith without consequence.

Edit:  Actually I should also note that I know [Muslims here in Vietnam](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islam_in_Vietnam) who are extremely liberal, but they are members of a very small, isolated and non-mainstream sect of Islam so I'm reluctant to include them.

I have stayed in St Salvator's hall and New Hall and have friends who stayed in others. I recommend staying in halls at least in first year.

With the caveat that what I am saying is subject to change: there are two degree courses available in straight-up CS; Computer Science and Internet Computer Science. The former includes more theoretical stuff and the latter has more networking and component technology, despite sounding extremely unfortunately like a web design course (it really isn't). The difference is only 2 modules or something, though.

A good move is to take maths modules in 1st and 2nd year but then do a degree in just CS. That's what I'd do in hindsight. As you know you pick a variety of subjects in 1st year and, to a lesser extent, 2nd year.

I think they still guarantee a place in halls for all first years. Private accommodation in St Andrews is very expensive - we are talking £100/person/week. This is due to simple supply/demand economics.

I have just come back from the JobCentre, a place I was once indifferent to, but now I hate it with a passion. 

I went to inform them that I got a job, part-time but a job nonetheless. You'd think that the advisor would be pleased and would offer some words of congratulations. BUT NO, she almost rolled her eyes and enquired as to why it wasn't more than 16 hours a week, and pointed out that I'd ""only be £20 a week better off."" WTF?? Surely a job is a job and it looks better on your CV to be working at ANYTHING rather than being idle? And an extra £20 is an extra £20 no matter how you look at it! 

I felt seriously demoralised after coming out of there. I don't know whether it's my Job Centre, or all of them (I went to another one at first and the guy there was super-helpful, especially with searching for work that I'm qualified for. At this one, they have told me time and again that they 'haven't those sort of jobs for me in the database', and then that's been that. What gives?)

What incensed me more is that I will still have to claim JSA and prove that I've been looking for full-time work AS WELL AS doing my new job! Sure, I'll be looking for work but I don't feel like I should have to prove it every two weeks (and the prospect of spending my free time hanging around that shithole just fills me with sadness).

An admirable dissection of the issue, enough to shame the most rigorous academic. Seriously.

Jezza (and, by proxy, yourself) are advocating that people with low education and income are having larger families in order to exploit the benefits system.

This would be a perfectly fine hypothesis, so let's see if stands up to scrutiny. If it were the case, we would see a rise in the sizes of nuclear families correlating to the establishment and prominence of the welfare system. **If**, on the other hand, **family sizes have either decreased or remained similar in the poorest**, say, **10% of British people in the last**, again say, **100 years then** there is no correlation and **your scape-goating is unjustified**.

Please feel free to dig up some figures, I'm sure we'd all be very interested to see if the hypothesis holds true. But if you want to be taken seriously, don't cite Jeremy 'Witch Hunter' Kyle as your source of information.

true,[deleted],null,null,"Yeah, but really we need to show people that the cuts aren't necessary.

Ultimately, the cuts are inevitable due to globalisation creating international competition between nations which forces us to drive down our taxes to compete for the business of multinational corporations (and so obtain employment and investment).

Add to this, the problem of the crises of demand as automation is creating a fundamental crisis in unemployment, which increases the effective supply of labour and so drives down wages. This acts to lower the purchasing power of the masses beyond the point at which they can afford to purchase goods at profitable prices, and so the businesses must then make redundancies to remain afloat and this only worsens the crisis. [Albert Einstein thought this was the main cause of the Great Depression](http://www.marxistoutlook.com/article19.htm). We have tried to offset it with easily available credit recently but even that is unsustainable as the debt becomes unprofitable when the debtors are made unemployed and can no longer afford the interest payments, and the whole system collapses, and has to be bailed out as we saw - which adds greatly to the national debt.

Fundamentally, the economic system is broken. Increasing automation acts to worsen the lives of the majority, as the competition for employment is increased and so wages are lowered and working conditions worsened, where it could be used to relieve the work burden on all and provide abundance.

I think a much greater change is needed than just opposing the cuts, for otherwise they can just claim they are necessary.

I used to belong to a large mixed group of people in our (vlarge) town when I was in my teens, the best description would be to say we were all of the ""rock"" group. Amongst our number there were lots of smaller cliques, we totalled around 100-200 people, or thereabouts.

The punk clique started up a sort of rivalry with what was known as the ""scene"" clique, living in another nearby town. They had a gang name, named after some street they hung out on.

Anyway, things went back and forth online for quite some time, until one day the punk clique from out town went to their town and stole their street sign.

The next day all hell broke loose, they all came to our town, armed to the teeth, knives, chains, bats, the lot. Multiple people got injured, thankfully nobody was hurt, me and a friend got ourselves involved and managed to protect some of the younger people, it was chaos though, I had the foresight to call the police the moment I saw them and they turned up in force incredibly quickly.

Sadly, almost all of them got away and it was our group that mostly got arrested, defending ourselves, including myself and my friend, the people that called the police at the time, I was in fact still on the phone to the operator as the police arrested me which was quite surreal.

The police tried to slap me and my friend with a bunch of offences including attacking a police officer, which was absolutely fabricated, they dropped everything in the end and went with something that basically amounted to ""acting aggressively"". We won in court.

People are actually allowed to carry guns around, and have them just sitting in their homes, and you claim that's anywhere close to the offensive weapons act, (which restricted gun club members, it didn't affect the public, because the public already didn't have guns)? Your country's wild west mentality is insane, and that includes New York. 

And BTW, New York actually has the lowest murder rate for big cities in the US, and 2009 was an unusually murder free year. Phoenix, Philly, LA, Chicago, Houston, Dallas, Phoenix, San Antonio [all have a much higher murder rate per capita than NY](http://i103.photobucket.com/albums/m151/Smoker_03/combo12-29-09.jpg) (and [here](http://i103.photobucket.com/albums/m151/Smoker_03/12-29-09.jpg) ) and they're all of the US cities with a million plus people. I'm sure you're going to claim they're all as restrictive as the UK too, but it's just not true for any of them.

&gt; 400 of those NY murders could have been from knife crime, while 100 of those London murders could have been from gun crime (hyperbole much?).

You really should be careful when making claims like that. Guns were responsible for [18 of the murders in London in 2009](http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/standard/article-23914131-murder-rate-in-london-is-lowest-since-1978-but-gun-killings-rise.do). I can't find figures for NY city, but [283 of them were committed with a gun wielded by someone the victim knew](http://www.thenewamerican.com/index.php/usnews/crime/2646-new-york-city-murder-rate-at-all-time-low), so there were more than 283 with guns. Even if it is only 283, that's more than 15 times as many as London's 18.

&gt; Fischer was the first historian to draw attention to the War Council held by the Kaiser Wilhelm II and the Reich's top military-naval leadership on December 8, 1912 in which it was declared that Germany would start a war of aggression in the summer of 1914.[8] Both the Kaiser and the Army leadership wanted to start a war at once in December 1912, but objections from Grand Admiral Alfred von Tirpitz, who while supporting the idea of starting a world war, argued that the German Navy needed more time to prepare, and asked that the war be put off until the summer of 1914.[9] The Kaiser agreed to Tirpitz's request.[10]

They spotted their chance in 1918, and turned a regional war into a war that encompassed nearly every civilised nation on Earth, with their General Staff working behind the scenes to get Austria into a state of fever pitch.  If it wasn't for them, there likely wouldn't have been any war, regional or not, in the first place.

Further, they needlessly and recklessly invaded Belgium to attack France, bringing the British Empire into the fray.  They knew full well that Britain was treaty bound to defend the neutrality of Belgium.  They turned the landscape of northern France into something that more resembled the surface of the moon than a developed country and caused a slaughter that they somehow managed to top in WW2.  The first day of the Somme saw 20,000 Commonwealth deaths, with an additional 30,000 injured.  Whole generations of males from some towns in Britain were wiped out in a single day.

true,ragewind,uk,,"yes alcohol is a major problem that needs a cultural change in attitude rather than all the current ideas of price will fix the problem thinking.

with the issue of the guns i give my vue on the item and ownership separately.

the item was designed for killing originally yes but then so was the knife way back in history its what we as humans to we naturally gravitate to finding the best tool to kill rather than having pure strength or claws/teeth. but we have also developed other uses such as sporting applications were we use fire arms are used. these sports have quite a wide skill set that isnt always used in other sports. there is also arguments that guns are prefect item for self defense allowing the weak or old to fend off much stronger opponents. the item its self has no more malice than the brick in your house walls or your car they all have a purpose but they can also all be used to kill, in the case's of cars they DO kill more each yeah in the UK and the US.

the number of gun crimes is a LOT more in the US than the UK yes but  the number of guns legally owned its disproportionally higher still in the US to the UK.

we have 138,728 firearm certificates issues and 574,946 shotgun certificates this gives a MAXIMUM total of 713,674 legal citizen that can own a form of gun, some will have both forms of license reducing the number. http://rds.homeoffice.gov.uk/rds/pdfs10/hosb0510.pdf

if we assume an average of 2 guns each certificate then you have 1.4milion legal long guns in the UK. 

by comarison her is an old artical estimating we have 4 million illigal firearms in the UK in 2005

http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/up-to-4m-guns-in-uk-and-police-are-losing-the-battle-505487.html

we also have the current news of a gun runner bringing them in on a normal flight and succeeding.

(daily fail sorry) http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1350295/Steven-Greenoe-smuggled-80-guns-UK-used-Manchester-shooting.html

lets not forget that our ban on pistols effected 60 thousand legal sports men which was 10 years ago and may have at best hope removed 240K legal pistols if ever one of the license holder had 4 in there collection.

this pails compared with the illegal guns in circulation in the UK which are owned by those that don't care for the law anyway.

the US has around 50% of there house holds owning firearms with a total of around 300 million in total there is a trend to have a collection in the form of number for the sake of having them unlike the UK were you need a purpose and regular use. and yet the overall rates of crime are not that far out.

so we have the a record low of 42 gun related deaths in the UK and from wiki the us has the Us as having 10100 homicides using guns.
we have around 0.5% of the legal guns the US has 1.5mil to 300mil

I know that you are agreeing with me. :) But it's really annoying to see you refer back to these cases as establishing the de facto law.

'The ""precedents"" you are talking about' were *not* set by Ron Atkinson, Rodney Marsh or the newspapers but by The Sex Discrimination Act of 1975, which protects individuals from being discriminated against in employment, vocational training, education, the provision and sale of goods, facilities and services, premises and the exercise of public functions due to their sex/gender.

true,Skitrel,null,null,"Hmm, I'll have to make sure I catch that, looked into it a couple of months back, wasn't aware it was showing now.

To go off topic a little bit from health, I was discussing the problems we have with a friend last night, I came to the conclusion that we need an entire governmental system that's based on transparency, with systems in place that hold members of the new government entirely accountable for any lies or poor actions they take. Salaries should be cut. Systems should be worked in to ensure problems like people moving through the ranks by making the right friends stop, position being determined by output, etc etc, an entirely new governmental system built on the foundation of ensuring it can't do anything that's wrong with the current one.

The problem that strikes me is that there isn't any system in place to enforce change in the government. This is something that would obviously have to be addressed in a new one, there is no way to make these changes at all. No party in power will ever change a system that brings them to power. There is nothing that forces necessary change.

The entire system we have doesn't work in favour of the country at all, it's inefficient and doesn't focus upon the primary goal of a better future. That's the government we need but the only way to get it would in fact be some form of revolution, which criminalises all of us. The entire thing confuses me, we have no power to enact the necessary change and taking that power makes us criminals. Succeeding would remove the criminal label though. It's all a giant clusterfuck.

The overall problem is that the government and the people are different things. In my opinion, as soon as you can draw a line between the two you can say that the government has failed.

Of course, nothing that was achieved was legal at the time really though. All the famous civil rights activists were arrested, etc. all that's necessary is for people to truly believe it is required, and so overcome the downsides to protesting like the possible loss of employment prospects, and criminal charges, etc.


The other major problems we face are the appeal to moderation (where people say we need the ""third way"", the end of ""isms"", the end of left and right, etc.) although usually what they call the centre is just a pathetic compromise within the fundamentally broken current economic system. These arguments have a lot of weight though, even on reddit.

Hm?

Being in a gang is one of the most secure places kids can be in these days. It provides them with a sense of social security, self identity, and importance within the group. Respect is given too between individuals, based on peoples history of helping the others out, being tough enough to protect the gang, and themselves, and get ahead of their rivals - via street-cred, money, or various other things.

Compare that to the social void society places them in until they're around 17 years old, and even then can only work menial jobs without any respect. Sure, in the old days ""We all had to start at the bottom, and work up! You stuck at it, and took the abuse!""

There's no ""working up"" any more, if you work at McDonalds at a till, there's little for you to move in to, the same with many factory jobs. Taking shit now would extend out to taking shit *forever*. Who's going to put up with that with no sign of a carrot?

They don't have family, and if they do it's likely they're divorced - and the parent they live with may work all the hours they can, or have mental health problems like depression and anxiety... that's not a loving stable home to identify with, that's not an authority figure.

Gangs replace what societies taken out of families, and communities.
Sadly, aggression and dominance is part of gang culture, and will always turn up due to rival gangs fighting.

Well, eventually we would provide free education to all people so they may be educated to do the work that cannot be automated. Of course there is a transition as this takes time (both education and automation) but things needn't change overnight, the important part is that we are moving in the right direction at all.

If people choose not to work then they would only be wasting their own lives. I think societal pressures would mostly stop it anyway, since co-operation would be necessary for the society to function. Ultimately the behaviour we see now is a product of our society and environment, when we put everything on wealth acquisition then people will be greedy and selfish, but if instead the focus is on improving science and technology and co-operation, then I think these problems would largely disappear.

Are local/satelite libraries not becoming obsolete? With the dawn of the internet, mobile libraries (that go to all communities) and school libraries offering connections and pick ups with local main libraries. I can't help but feel the tiny community libraries are becoming a bit pointless.

Nowadays if I want a library book I'l go to the online catalogue of my County (Worcesterdhire) and request that it be sent and reserved at the nearest town (Bromsgrove). Instead of my nearest community (Catshill - which is walkign distance). I'd find it easier to drive into town to pick up than walk/drive out of my way to the village library.

Small community libraries often have unfavourable opening hours, and poor book selection. If the choice was basically: More books or more libraries - I'd rather have more books.

We've got plenty of international student here, including many French, and have a great language program which insists on a year abroad. I would be surprised if you didn't find several people with similar interests and backgrounds to you here to be honest.

Finally, make sure you watch Series 3 of ""Torchwood"" (more commonly called ""Torchwood: Children of Earth"") at some point between DW Series 4 and ""The End of Time, Part One.""

Originally the curators of the chuff sought funding from English Heritage but were told that due the Scottish name it wouldn't be politically appropriate without them going to Scottish Heritage first. They applied to Scottish Heritage, but the response was largely unintelligible, consisting mainly of strange words and random threats of sexual violence. An application to Welsh heritage was also made, but was rejected on the grounds of the use of vowels in the application and a relatively low number of l's, f's and d's. Thankfully a dubai investment consortium helped reconstruct the main cervical hall and funding from the lottery commission brought the chuff to a state where it could be rented out for events. So popular has Carol McGiffin's chuff for hosting weddings, receptions and a transport fair (where it was confirmed that it is possible to park a bus in her chuff and still have room to swing a cat) that the dubai investment consortium have now had 120% of their investment returned in the past 18 months alone. With the introduction of air conditioning and a humidifier to counteract the dryness in the walls, it is believed that Carol McGiffin's chuff has not been in such good condition since 1681.

 Its similar in China, they are all chinese but identify themselves as certain tribes depending on which country they migrated from, I am indian but call myself british Indian, my SO is Russian, he will become British later on but our kids will be mixed and I plan on making sure they know both heritages and are labelled as mixed but no one or other label.

He presents *Strictly Come Dancing*, a dancing ballroom/latin contest in which celebrities pair up with professional dancers.

* **Graham Norton** - TV presenter and comedian. You may have seen him before if you've ever seen *Father Ted*. He has his own

* **Amanda Holden** - Actress and TV presenter, although she only seems to present X Factor now. She's not very well liked.

Modern transfers are a mess because of price inflation bought on by Barcelona, Real Madrid and City. Every club now thinks that their players are worth what they price them at, not at what clubs want to buy.

Third party owners doesn't help the situation, look at what Chelsea are going through with Luiz - it is all because there are third party agents involved and the club need to jack the price to get at least 15-17M for themselves.

Luckily we don't have that with Suarez, but no large deal takes place without 2-3 agents each getting 1-1.5M Euro.

Yes it can be argued that there is less representation of the countries true demographics, but assuming that those in power do actually listen to the wishes of their constituents, then they are being justly represented, even if the person representing them comes from a very different back ground. You don't see drug addicts representing people in court, because the lawyers have spent years working out how best to represent their clients, and on that keel it should be expected that our elected representatives will do a better job of representing our interests due to their education and ability (although this is a perfect ideal in an imperfect world, but that wouldn't be changed with having more working class MPs)

On that note, I was disappointed by one of the comments at the bottom suggesting that Oxbridge universities should directly represent the population at large. In recent years the class entry has been degraded and all but removed, so those going to Oxford or Cambridge are those who have achieved the top results from the entire population. The chances of those top achievers should not be damaged just to fulfill a demographic spread to mirror that of the country at large.

It's not even like the project was green-lit by the present government, so the story doesn't even reflect bad planning by the coalition.

The only reason the story is considered newsworthy is because the writer *knows* that people will react emotionally to the idea that ""smashing up new plane = waste"", and ignore the rational consideration that - while it's regrettable - doing do will save 2bn.

I'm seeing this more and more in news reporting - stories designed to whip up emotion and make people react emotionally or short-sightedly, but which *if you consider them rationally* are perfectly sensible or complete non-events.

Brand new high-tech spy-planes smashed up?  Well, what *else* should we do with them?  Pay 2bn to maintain them unnecessarily?  *Give* them to a foreign power?  Leave them lying around for spies to break into and learn our surveillance capabilities at any time?

Well, no... when you think about it sensibly, though it seems wasteful, given we've *already* paid for them to be constructed, it makes most rational sense to cut costs and dismantle them.  How much use we got out of them has *emotional* resonance, but is *rationally* immaterial.

What, the project that was green-lit *years* ago, by the previous (or even last-but-one administration), long before the credit crunch?  Before the mainstream consensus knew that we'd lack the money to spend maintaining the planes once they'd been built? &lt;:-)

I mean you can take a generalised stand against *any and all* big-budget military spending if you like, but apart from that - despite what your emotions are telling you - there's *nothing here* to get outraged about.

They approved the project when everyone believed we had the money to execute and support it, and as soon as it became apparent we didn't, they canned it to save the remaining money.  The money we'd ploughed into the project and now lost is regrettable, but there was no way to know it would be wasted before the credit crunch, and killing the project now is the best way to avoid losing any *more* money now the credit crunch has happened.

There's no lesson to be learned, no sensible way to avoid it ever happening in the future, and nothing to get upset about here apart from, you know, ""that people can't see into the future"".

I'm just going to go with ""because sometimes there is no get-out""?

If you plan to build a bridge, you get half of it done and then suddenly there's no more money to complete it, what do you do?  Half a bridge is useless, so what do you do?  Never build bridges? Or bite the bullet, tear down the existing half a bridge and chalk it up to experience? &lt;:-)

&gt; Couldn't we have bought some 737s or Airbuses and fit them up?

I'm not an expert, but I'm going to go out on a limb here and guess neither are you, because this sounds like the worst kind of armchair quarterbacking.

Suffice it to say that I'm *pretty sure* that there are some things a specifically-designed military reconnaissance and attack aircraft can do that your bog-standard refitted passenger airliner can't.  Or, you know, they'd just buy one of them and use it for a tiny fraction of the price, and there would *be* no worldwide industry designing and building military aeroplanes.

I'm not claiming the MOD or government procurement procedures are brilliant (hell: even ""barely adequate""), but you're *already* outraged at the waste (see the ""sunk cost fallacy"" link, above), and all you can offer are hypotheses that *might* excuse your emotional reaction.

The correct sequence of events is to be puzzled and concerned, research the situation to find out whether you *should* be outraged, and *then* get outraged if the answers to your (then *educated*) questions justify it.

For example, it's entirely possible that 737s and Airbuses are wholly unsuited for the precise combat role a Nimrod is intended to fulfil, and/or perhaps it wasn't designed with degradable equipment levels because they were trying to be smart and save money *then*.  FYI, the project that became the Nimrod MRA4 began *[in 1992](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BAE_Systems_Nimrod_MRA4)*.

You don't even *know* if it's justified or not, and yet you're already outraged... and all you can offer to excuse it are weak hypotheticals where *neither* of us have a clue as to their realistic likelihoods.

I honestly can't work out why writers think the Doctor should more or less randomly appear somewhere and stumble upon some adventure, surely it would make more sense for him to be some sort of detective/investigator for universe shattering problems?

Take for example this last series, where he seemingly stumbled upon the leaks in time and space (I forget what they were).  Given the whole series was ultimately, however loosely, based upon them it probably would have made for a more enjoyable series had it been more focussed around them.

You're more or less right. The 737, as a passenger liner, isn't that great at the sort of low-level manoeuvring a maritime patrol aircraft might need to do, and the yanks have run into huge problems trying to get it working for their P-8.  Nimrod would have been a far superior plane; almost double the range, payload and surveillance abilities with a sturdy thick-winged airframe that is as nimble at 1000ft as 30'000.

&gt;There's no lesson to be learned, no sensible way to avoid it ever happening in the future, and nothing to get upset about here apart from, you know, ""that people can't see into the future"". And that's just dumb. :-/

I'm not sure I'd agree with this. There are a lot of lessons to be learnt, both in the procurement and specification of military projects, and the way military and financial decisions interact with engineering realities. Military procurement really is a mess in this country, and we're messing it up even now (delaying the Trident decision will cost millions, all because of the political tension within the coalition).

It would likely have been far far cheaper to build entirely new Comet airframes to a required specification then retrofit the older MR2's - BAE warned MoD about this at the time. The planes being broken up right now are almost entirely new airframes anyway, after the amount of things they had to replace.

There's a good blog post on it [here](http://www.thinkdefence.co.uk/2010/10/the-nimrod-insanity/), and an open-letter from a number of concerned engineers [here](http://www.thinkdefence.co.uk/2011/01/nimrod-is-it-too-late/).

true,benbrooks,eng-Cheshire,Cheshire,"Set it to read voltage, and make sure you put the leads in the right holes for voltage.

If you put them in the current holes you've just got yourself a ~zero resistance piece of wire and things may get a *little* hot ;)

Of course, **always be extremely careful** when dealing with mains and don't do anything you're not 100% sure of. If there's a safer way to test voltage or current then I'd recommend doing that.

**Disclaimer:** I don't hold any responsibility for what happens if you decide to follow this advice :x If in doubt, get an electrician in.
