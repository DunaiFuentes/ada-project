Already reported, but Torres is not for sale at any price andEssien is expected to return in mid-January.

New news includes Lampard possibly starting against Wigan, a win against them would be the first four game win streak of the season.

Big news regarding Drogba, it seems we are now open to a two-year extension:

&gt; 'It's between a two-year and a one-year and we're waiting to make the best decision possible,' he said. 'We've been discussing this week in week out, the situation is on-going and we hope to solve it. Whatever the outcome or agreement, or non-agreement, there will be no question of his professionalism and integrity and he will keep on representing Chelsea this season.

Unlike popular propaganda there are no extra safety mechanisms with a credit card. If it says ""Visa"" then the transaction mechanism is identical and you can do chargebacks and all the other nice things a credit card can.

I can understand the use for offsetting your purchases and your pay. I just muddled through until I was floating enough for this not to be an issue. I know it is inefficient floating money but I've seen too many people get caught out by credit card charges for this to be an issue. You only need to slip up once for a credit card charge to wipe out any interest you might have earned by being able to store away an extra £1k in a savings account.

true,WoodElephant,tardis,TARDIS,"it seems more to me from his quotes in that interview like he left due to being treated as somewhat 'special' in comparison to the rest of the cast/crew. 

this part especially led me to my conclusion:

&gt; Eccleston: ""You know, it’s easy to find a job when you’ve got no morals, you’ve got nothing to be compromised, you can go, ‘Yeah, yeah. That doesn’t matter. That director can bully that prop man and I won’t say anything about it’. But then when that director comes to you and says ‘I think you should play it like this’ you’ve surely got to go ‘How can I respect you, when you behave like that?’""

however, i will admit the way he phrased it does lend some credence to your theory that he was uncomfortable with the homosexual undercurrents. i think i would just hope that someone who is an actor by trade would not want to leave a show over a perceived 'homosexual agenda'. but, some say 'agenda', i say 'friendliness'. i think its nice that a show gives same sex relationships the same weight as romances between opposing genders. cuz, like, were all huuumans, maaaan. ;)

why the hell did your post inspire me to both write and think about this so much?! this is simultaneously hilarious and somewhat concerning. 

i love tv.

true,BarelyReal,null,null,"Moffat has a fondness for non linear story telling to bring new meaning to events, characters, and play with audience expectations. He used it in clever ways in Coupling, and as the structure for an episode of Jekyll. I don't recall any major use of it in Sherlock, though the stories and source material don't afford him that opportunity(MAYBE in the Scandal in Bohemia). 

You add that to a series which can take all of that a step further, beyond the simple story telling format to the audience and actually integrate it into the story itself. Like others have said, Moffat jumping head first and trying to be very clever backed him into a corner because it became so jumbled. Add to that his Lost style layering of arcs and the constant revealing of the ""man behind the curtain"" to drive several arcs into one(Cracks-Silence-Question). He became way too ambitious, and sometimes you can tell that many of the story ideas(not just his) seem intended for the old school 3-4 episode format.

So yeah, his writing's got flaws - just like everybody elses. His plotcraft is brilliant, but his character development...eh, so-so. He focuses a lot on the small number of main characters while side ones are horribly forgettable. I mean, think about it - his most memorable and interesting side character was Jim the Fish.

Think about that and then think back to the RTD's era when every side character from every standalone episode was well fleshed out and an actual person. 

Moffat's got action, he's got a brain for plotlines. Things he's good at - he's BRILLIANT at. Would I fancy a bit more focus on standalone episodes and side characters? Sure.

In ""Doomsday"", there were Daleks in the sky, though you could argue they didn't have time to get far from London, so maybe Van Statten is clueless because he never goes on YouTube (and neither does anyone on his staff). 

In ""The Stolen Earth"", however, Daleks are everywhere and totally wreck the place. I'm thinking it was 2008ish?

So you could say the events in ""Dalek"" never happened. You could also  follow that line of thought to convince yourself that it's significant enough to mean that the Ninth Doctor doesn't regenerate due to what happens in ""Parting of the Ways"" which was directly related to what happened in ""The Long Game"", the first place they took Adam because the Doctor wanted to let Rose show off her mad time-travel skills.

Clearly if the rest of Europe choose to gang up on us, it will go badly for us, but if we gave in to pressure like that, it would go badly for us anyway, and it's better to be hanged for a sheep than a lamb.

All they seemed to accomplish in the meeting was to isolate and attempt to scapegoat the UK.  This continues their long-standing behaviour of failing to address, or even admit the very serious problems they face.  When their problems resurface, I suspect we will see fractures within the group of 26, and perhaps we won't be left so isolated after all.

We have economic and social problems as serious as those in Europe, but at least we have the advantage that our government (and I hate saying this about Tories) is not living in Cloud Cuckoo Land.

de Bruyne: Looks good, had some exciting play in the CL, but should not be expected to have the same impact as say, Mata. He'll need time to develop, much like Lukaku, so we'd need to sign someone else too, because we need an impact player right now. I think you said that though.

Hazard/Goetze: These players would be dream signings. Especially Goetze for me, personally (German connection). I think we missed out on someone truly special with Oezil, so this is the next best thing. At some point we could even have Mata/Goetze/Hazard with Sturridge up top. Maybe not a lot of strength but an insane amount of speed and skill.

Vargas: Decent, but I'd want de Bruyne for the future and Hazard/Goetze now, which doesn't leave room for him really.

Modric: I think the emergence of Romeu means he wouldn't have a spot in our XI. I think AVB prefers having two box to box midfielders.

true,Tetzel,eng-manchester,Greater Manchester,"The only problem i have is with people like Mr Cameron thinking that the Bible is needed to get some sense of morality. The bible frequently advocates mass murder, genocide, rape, and slavery. I do not think this is any place for someone to get their morals from, unless they choose to pick and choose scripture from a Holy, infallible text (as modern Christianity does) 

Jesus' teachings are not more authoritative by default, that is a decision that some people make, but others choose not to. Lots of Christians say that homosexuality is  a bad thing. It's in the bible after all. But Jesus never mentioned explicitly mentioned homosexuality (though he did say ""There is NOTHING from without a man, that entering into him can defile him"" [Mark 7:15] which we can take to mean that homosexual acts do not defile you, and thus are not sinful), he advocated love to your neighbour and all that carry on. So who do we believe? Do we look to Jesus' teachings about loving one another, and loving God? Or do we look to the other parts of the Bible which condemn homosexuality? 

It's pretty confusing to think that people can look at Jesus's teachings for guidance when he is only in the Bible for a very, VERY, small amount of time. After all, there's hundreds of things he doesn't speak about, but which God himself condemns.

And to call into doubt the authoritativeness of some parts of the Bible is to cast the rest of it's authoritativeness into doubt. I find it funny that some people think they can pick and choose holy scripture.

Anyways, I promised you an answer, so here it is. 

ALSO I apologize in advance if I sound like I'm talking down to you. I'm not. I'm just going to start with the basic building blocks of the physics here. I’m going to develop it much like one would develop a proof, starting with the easy stuff and then incorporating more and more complex aspects, just so everyone can follow along. And to keep it interesting, I'm going to speak purely in concepts, so you don't have to be proficient in math to remain entertained. 

Anyway, let's tuck in!


Remember how Buzz Lightyear called his gliding “falling with style?” That’s pretty much all an orbit is. When the pull of gravity and the effect of the natural centrifugal behavior match, you have orbit.  What’s natural centrifugal behavior, you ask? You may know it as Centrifugal Force, however I don’t like to use that term. It’s not a force, it’s a standard natural behavior (Yes, I know a lot of you will argue with me on this one, but a lot of people are already busy doing that already, so let’s not bother wasting our time.) Regardless of what you call it, it’s pretty much the pull you feel when you spin a rope attached to a ball around your head. It’s also the same thing that keeps the water in the bucket when you spin it really quickly over your head. “What causes such wizardry?” you may ask. Simple. Newton’s first law: “The velocity of a body remains constant unless the body is acted upon by an external force” (http://bit.ly/sKwX1M). Let’s consider the ball-on-rope situation. Assuming you don’t hit anyone in the face, the ball will spin around you and you will feel a pull on the rope. Consider the masterfully drawn image 1-A-Alpha. (http://i.imgur.com/rsez4.png) In this image, the black X is you, spinning wildly. The Black ball is the spinning mace of doom, and the red circle is the path of the ball. The blue arrow is the force cause by the rope. The green arrow is Newton’s first law in action. The ball desires to continue on a straight path. Because of this argument between the two forces, we get an orbit. I could go into vectors and all that fun stuff, but I don’t want to. Just think of it as timey-wimey stuff. Because of the pull of the blue arrow, the green arrow behaves as an opposite of the blue arrow. Boom. Orbit. Orbit because of balance. If this balance didn’t exist, for example if the green arrow force overpowered the blue arrow force, the rope would snap and the ball would go flying over the wall and you would have to spend the rest of the day trying to track down your shiny red ball. (Sound familiar? [http://bit.ly/sEU9wE] Boom. Upvote for nostalgia). Bang. Balance. Balance is a key part of this. 

Let’s take this ball-on-string example and let it run wild on a large scale. Here’s our new picture. Should look pretty familiar. http://i.imgur.com/brfFp.jpg Instead of a rope, we have the pull of the sun’s gravity. The green arrow is still the exact same thing. Newton. Remember? Good. This is the exact same thing happening here, except in this example if the string breaks you don’t go hunting all over town trying to find your lost ball. Instead you freeze. So does everyone else. Everyone dies and it’s your fault. Congratulations, you destroyed humanity. Gee…let’s hope that doesn’t happen. As the same time, however, we have another danger. Instead of just falling on the grass if our speed is to slow, causing our green arrow force to shrink, we get pulled in to the sun. And we burn. And humanity is destroyed. Again. Remember what I said about balance? Yeah. It’s pretty damn important. We’re riding a razors edge between blazing fire and freezing cold. Good thing we’ll all be dead before the earth slows down enough and the sun grows large enough to light the air on fire. Because that’s probably what’s going to happen.

ANYWAY. Green arrow, blue arrow balance. Orbit. We got that? Now let’s bring in The Doctor. If you were on board up until now, this next part is going to probably seem pretty straight-forward. 

Oh. I just booted up the episode. Turns out I’m total wrong. For some reason I was under the impression that the “impossible planet” wasn’t orbiting, but was rather just sitting there, motionless, without a green arrow force to keep the blue arrow force at bay. 
But they just said they were in orbit. So in answer to your question, there’s no reason that should be impossible, however at that close of a proximity to a large black hole like that they would need to be orbiting very, very quickly in order to maintain enough centrifugal behavior to counteract the gravitational pull of that black hole.

tl;dr: Totally possible, not an impossible planet. Doctor Who lied to you. Sorry for wasting your time. Hey at least some of you now have a better understanding of orbits. Next time open the door. Get on the floor. Everybody walk the dinosaur.

EDIT: smh at my weak attempts at turning my failures into a troll. And general tomfoolery.

Whilst it's tempting to lump all religious people into one easily-dismissed group, I think it's a mistake and only polarises things further.

true,McCackle,eng-sussex,West Sussex,"Well, first off I think you're mischaracterising his remarks. He makes a point of recognising and celebrating the fact that there are many people in Britain who have no faith or are of another faith. He does not say that the Bible is ""needed"" to get some sense of morality - he's just saying that we shouldn't be afraid of admitting that this country has been shaped by Christianity (not exclusively, of course) and that religious viewpoints or faith positions should not be excluded from our public discourse. So I think you're over-reacting to what was said.

As to your points on Jesus and scriptural authority, I think you're arguing with points I've not made. It's a straightforward and pretty unassailable truth that Christians consider Christ as revealed in The New Testament* their primary source of authority and that other parts of the canon (such as The Old Testament) are interpreted in that light. The fact that Jesus appears for less time is neither here nor there and, if you'll forgive me, suggests a fundamental misunderstanding of how Christians approach The Bible**. I don't disagree at all that the idea of scriptural authority is routinely misappropriated by all sorts of wingnuts to cater to their own prejudices, but a general frustration with religion is tangential to Cameron's remarks.

*Mormons a notable exception.

true,Tetzel,eng-manchester,Greater Manchester,"The thing is, he's using the fact he's happy to have Britain containing many religions as a bit of a cop-out. He says '""But what I am saying is that the Bible has helped to give Britain a set of values and morals which make Britain what it is today."" which i think is a very silly thing to say. He looks to the Bible as some kind of foundation of morality when in fact, the morals we hold so dear to our hearts can come from any number of religious texts, and also from humans without religion. He has no real need to attribute these morals to the Bible, especially when the Bible is such a violent text. He ignores many of the actual words of the Bible and instead opts for the Sunday School nicey-nicey version. He does say, as you pointed out, that we shouldn't be afraid of admitting that this country has been shaped by Christianity, but to entertain the idea that this country is still Christian in any real and non-technical way, is just a little bit silly.

He goes on to praise a multicultural and multifaith society whilst opting for the assimilation cop-out ""We are a Christian country and we should not be afraid to say so,"" this 'we' he speaks aims for a sense of united identity (we the people of the United Kingdom of Great Britain) and seems to exclude the sense of 'other.' It's not a sense of cultures and faiths living together, it's a sense of other faiths and other cultures assimilating to the collecting 'we', a collective Mr Cameron identifies as Christian.

He goes on to praise the fact that a Christian nation is better than a secular one through anecdotal evidence ""easier for people to believe and practise other faiths when Britain has confidence in its Christian identity"". This seems to be massively stupid to me. Why does a Christian identity (only a technicality and not really an issue in day-to-day life) help other faiths to believe? He seems to be advertising the Christian faith of the nation as some kind of catch-all superior to other nations, by the fact he says that other faiths feel better because we're Christian. That just screams ridiculous. Of course he goes on to explain why ""Why? Because the tolerance that Christianity demands of our society provides greater space for other religious faiths too."" I don't think this tolerance is really something he should be attributing to the Christian faith, and more importantly i don't think he should be attributing this Christian faith to Britain.

I think your point that 'he's just saying that we shouldn't be afraid of admitting that this country has been shaped by Christianity' seems to be the narrow view. It seems to me that he's saying that the teachings of Christianity still have some semblance of importance to this country (not just to individuals) and that religion and politics should be in some way mixed. This i don't agree with. I don't think that religion should have anything to do with politics, especially when we live in such a diverse multifaith society like this.

Now i was a Christian for a number of years, and whenever i attended church we were 'taught' pretty exclusively from the New Testament. However there were some Old Testament teachings thrown in too, Noah's ark and the like. The teachings of new testament Jesus are all very well and good, but nothing remotely special. He was not magically the first person to say you should be nice to your neighbour, and i fear that someone as intelligent and privileged as David Cameron can be as short-sighted as to think that Christianity as a religion is any real base of morality for this country, or that it should be held in any high regard, if you get what i'm saying. I don't think the religion who's institution hid the rape and abuse of thousands of children from millions of people for many, many years is any real moral authority. And i don't think Mr Cameron truly acknowledges the fact that Britain as a society, although it was shaped by Christianity, isn't really still a Christian nation. Christianity as a religion is responsible for some of the worst atrocities in the world, and to attribute GB to that just reeks of idiocy to me. 
 
(I'm too tired for this, but the t;'dr is that Britain isn't actually a Christian country, and to call it a Christian country is insulting to people of no/other faiths, and a very narrow sighted thing to do. I think David Cameron is out of touch on this issue, and instead of just accepting and acknowledging that Christianity helped shaped this countries justice system, he's trying ensure that Christianity as a religion still has some place in politics and the subsequent justice system. I'm against this, if you couldn't tell)

true,McCackle,eng-sussex,West Sussex,"No, it made sense, I just think we disagree :-)

&gt; He looks to the Bible as some kind of foundation of morality when in fact, the morals we hold so dear to our hearts can come from any number of religious texts, and also from humans without religion. 

Well, actually, the publication of the King James Bible - the first English translation - was *hugely* influential in terms of how we developed as a country in almost all aspects. The key impact was the beauty of the language, but even more so the fact that the spiritual authority that previously was held by a small clique of latin-speaking clerics was now open to scurtiny and challenge by others. There's no denying the important of Christianity and the Bible in our country's history. Now that doesn't mean Christianity or The Bible have some inherent value or authority or are relevant now, but it is foolish to pretend the past didn't happen.

&gt; especially when the Bible is such a violent text. He ignores many of the actual words of the Bible and instead opts for the Sunday School nicey-nicey version.

Careful now. The Bible is a complex multi-authored multi-era text that needs to be understood in literary context. It's only fundamentalists who attribute equal weight without qualification to every word.

&gt; but to entertain the idea that this country is still Christian in any real and non-technical way, is just a little bit silly

I agree that it's silly (and straightforwardly untrue) to argue that the country is Christian in a religious sense. We are, however, *culturally* Christian - and that's the category mistake that people like Cameron and the Archbishop of York tend to fall into.

&gt; Why does a Christian identity (only a technicality and not really an issue in day-to-day life) help other faiths to believe? He seems to be advertising the Christian faith of the nation as some kind of catch-all superior to other nations, by the fact he says that other faiths feel better because we're Christian. That just screams ridiculous.

The fact that we have developed in a way that balances a largely secular state with a recognition and respect for religion does make the UK a comfortable place for other faiths. However, I think he's wrong to attribute that achievement to Christianity, it's more something we had to achieve in order to put religion in its proper place.


&gt; It seems to me that he's saying that the teachings of Christianity still have some semblance of importance to this country (not just to individuals) and that religion and politics should be in some way mixed. This i don't agree with. I don't think that religion should have anything to do with politics, especially when we live in such a diverse multifaith society like this.

I don't think religion and politics should mix either, but I think it depends on what we mean by mixed. I am happy for the religious to be part of a debate and to have their religious convictions inform their views, but I don't want religious organisations seeking political power or subverting secular systems. I'm pretty sure Cameron was calling for the former rather than the latter.

&gt; as short-sighted as to think that Christianity as a religion is any real base of morality for this country, or that it should be held in any high regard, if you get what i'm saying. I don't think the religion who's institution hid the rape and abuse of thousands of children from millions of people for many, many years is any real moral authority.

Christianity is not some single block that we can simply dismiss or celebrate all at once. There are distinctions here, and there are aspects of Christianity that are indeed moral and worthy of high regard. We need to be more discriminating in our condemnation. Case in point, the organisation you're talking about covering up abuse is the Catholic Church, not the Church Of England.",0,1324086655,null,0,false,0,c38rb2s,t3_nfjdj,t1_c38rb2s,t1_c38r214,1428033817,4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,4

I volunteer with an organisation that works with children, and people who show up once or twice actually hinders our attempts to do some good. From our point of view, as a kids charity, we see a surge in interest around September (students looking for ""CV Gold"", mums with young kids who are bored when their kids go back to school) and just before and after Christmas. It depends on what you're doing, but we have to sort out a CRB check, spend time training you, introduce you to the kids and so on for you to turn up once and then disapear. It does leave us in a bit of a predicament, because we either spend the time developing you to do something, for you to then not bother for another 12 months, or tell you that you aren't wanted, running the risk of losing a good volunteer, and the negative feeling that generates, or spend time explaining to you that by turning up once or twice a year you are actually a drain on resources. I've known really good volunteers quit because they were so fed up of spending all their time training and sorting paperwork for people who show up once or twice a year and then vanish, rather than doing what they wanted to do. 

The reason you can't find anywhere to take your one day a year ""help"" is because it just isn't nessisary. You know what, volunteering at a soup kitchen feels good, and that is why people do it day in, day out every day, rain, snow or shine, from January to November, as well as the 24-26th December. And if I managed a soup kitchen, who would I give these popular slots to? My regular volunteers, or some guy who turns up once a year? Some guy who doens't know the system, doens't know the regulars? Some guy I can't trust? I don't think so. 

You're post, to me, suggests that you're only interested in the feel good factor of helping, as opposed to actually wanting to help. The ideal solution would be to help out regularly. From a charity point of view, this is one of the big things that we need, a couple of hours every week will help so much, especially if it is regular and we can plan other volunteers and events around you. I understand that not everyone can help out regularly, so how about offering your services on an as and when basis, being totally open and honest about when you can/will help out. This only really works if you have a skill that is useful to a charity. Next on the list would be a donation, again, ideally regularly, but a one off donation over Christmas is great too. There are so many ways to help out charities and the needy, turning up once to ladel out soup and not giving a shit for the other eleven months is *way* down the list. 

Sorry if you didn't want to hear this, and I'm sure you're a great person who is trying to help out, and other charities might be in a different situation (I don't know of any, but there may be some), but from my point of view, you're just getting in the way.

I also asked the question of another friend who is positive are your meds branded, and indeed it seems that big pharma does continue to make a killing at the expense of the taxpayer. Not as much of a shock, but it begs the question, why we dont reduce the time period that these companies have exclusivity rights for pandemic conditions and issue generics.

*That* at least suggests to me that 9's rebuild of the TARDIS happened during, or very soon after, the War. (I'm going to guess ""during"", because if 9 is the incarnation responsible for the destruction of the Daleks/ Gallifrey [fact], I'm guessing he would have needed a TARDIS.) 9/10's control room very closely resembles 7/8's (as opposed to earlier versions), so it probably rebuilt itself to be more immediately comfortable/familiar to him in the regeneration process (assuming that the rebuild process is some mix between the Doctor's tastes in style and whatever the TARDIS wants to do).

Again, this is all just conjecture. I'm not sure what 7 might have gone through to force the TARDIS to change appearance so completely (out of choice OR necessity), but I've only seen parts of 7, and no peripheral materials.

Not *necessary*, but I feel like being able to keep yourself out of a sort of mass-crisis event that would destroy two fairly-important species in a major time-lock event... you know. I'm just postulating. I haven't read the Infitiny Doctors, so... I need to get to that.

To your first point:

I can't personally cite the media in which the 8/9 regeneration occurred, but if both 8 and 9 fought on the front-lines of the Time War... then... I would assume he didn't just take a break from the war. I *can* cite this paragraph from the [Wikipedia article on the matter](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_War_%28Doctor_Who%29):

&gt;In the IDW comic miniseries The Forgotten, the Tenth Doctor recounts to Martha Jones a story from the Eighth Doctor's participation in the Time War. The Eighth Doctor was imprisoned by a race of robots for several weeks on a planet in the middle of the war, before teaming up with a Malmooth fellow prisoner and faking his death in order to escape. It is revealed his capture was staged by him so that he could acquire the Great Key he needed to arm a modified De-Mat Gun that could be used to seal the Medusa Cascade. The Tenth Doctor further implies that the Eighth Doctor died, companionless, at the end of the Time War.

And we know that 9 effectively ends the war (and that it WAS 9, from what I'm understanding) by the Gallifrey/Dalek ""destruction"".

I don't know how canon that all is, but... I'm going off of what the internet's giving me.

Life lesson: I need more money to be able to really get deep into the peripheral materials because literally, up to this post, I had very little interest in actually caring about the Time War and what exactly happened to 8/9 there (I think my brain just enjoyed assuming ""stuff happened and it was time wizards and just *shut up and enjoy this*"".)

We still don't cover PEP for sexual exposure!  It's sheer idiocy sometimes.

Public health everywhere has been slow to realize that early identification and treatment are some of the most important elements in curbing further infections.

&gt; In May 2011, a study involving 1,763 HIV-serodiscordant couples [...] showed those who started antiretroviral therapy immediately significantly lowered the risk of HIV transmission to their sexual partners, compared to those starting treatment later, when their CD4 count had fallen below 250 cells/mm3. The results showed a 96 percent reduction in risk of transmission.

That's more effective than typical use of condoms (!).

It's available in India for $1,500 (the fact that antivirals are even available at-cost in the developing world is a concession that took 15+ years of political action), that's the actual cost to produce it.

Yes, some disabled people ""take the piss"", and many do not - but that doesn't change the realities that there does seem to have been a very odd surge in people claiming disabled allowances over the past decade.

It's not that there is a rise in disabilities, but there was political pressure to put long-term unemployed people onto the disabled quota as it took them off the unemployment count.

I was extremely ill a few years ago and was slightly alarmed and annoyed at how much pressure I was put under to accept that I am a ""write off"" and to be disabled. Tons of help for me to be ill, but surprisingly little assistance to help me get back to work.

Fortunately, I had a very understanding employer who helped me during the year it took for me to be able to recover to the point that I could do a normal days work - but I can bet a lot of people in my situation with less generous employers would have been pushed onto the disability route.

I would rather have a system where the presumption is that you can work, and that you will be helped back to work - and then only if it is found that you really can't do any work at all, then we are more generous to the much smaller numbers of people who are full-time disabled.

Blood is a major factor in HIV transmission, especially in female -&gt; male sexual transmission, receptive male -&gt; insertive male anal sex and especially IV drug use.

I think the truth is that, from a personal health perspective, the jury is still very much out on exactly when one should begin taking antivirals.  There have been numerous studies with conflicting results and there are many,  many factors to take into consideration.

I don't know what the actual CD4 limit that the NHS uses is, but if it's 250 / mm^3 (that's a common threshold), that is too low and based on outdated medical knowledge.  Starting at 250 has been shown to be a bit on the late side.  200 / mm^3 is the threshold for an AIDS diagnosis!

Whether one should start ASAP or at 400/350 is another question.

Have you any idea how much stress and worry that places on people?  I'm all for people who can work doing so, but to assume that everyone is capable until proven otherwise places the onus on the claimant to prove they are unable to work, which under the present system comes down to visit from a doctor being paid by the DWP to prove the claimant is not disabled.  That's pretty close to guilty until proven innocent in my book.

What we need is a system that assesses people based on their needs first and their ability to contribute second, and to provide help for them to do so, rather than writing them off until their next medical assessment is due.  

There is no interaction between the DWP, the local NHS/GP or Occupational Health.  That's something that should be addressed.  It's all very well for the DWP to say 'If you have x,y, or z you could work part time' when a) the NHS or local council that has to find the money to provide it, and b) they have no idea that it's required.

With the present system a person is not disabled unless the DWP determines this to be the case.  Their GP can of course determine if they are fit to work or not and issue a sick note accordingly, but they are *not* deemed disabled for the purposes of claiming DLA until the DWP has performed it's own assessment, which generally takes 30-60 minutes and is performed by a 'health care professional' that may or may not be a doctor and may or may not have any understanding of the claimants problems.  To use your analogy of taking exams that's like studying Physics for four years and having your final grade determined by a Humanities lecturer who may or may not have any understanding of your subject.

&gt;What is better is to find out why people are stressed by the system and find out if that is itself a disability or simple lack of understanding about the process.

The reason it's so stressful is that the process seems to be actively trying to stop people with genuine needs being able to claim, or appeal the decision.  The claim form for DLA for instance is in the region of 80 pages long, it takes upwards of two months for a claim to be processed and in our case took an additional 18 months to go to tribunal.  18 months in which we provided the DWP with 200 additional pages of medical reports and information on my wife's condition.  The only time the DWP requested information from the NHS themselves was when ordered to do so by HMCS.  Let's go back to your analogy again.

The fact of the matter is that the political pressure to move people on to disability has left us with a large amount of long term unemployed who could work but are caught in the benefits trap (i.e. that by going to work they'd make less money than they get on benefits - not that there's a large surplus of jobs for people who've been long term unemployed at the moment but I think my point stands).

If we distinguish between people being 'anti-disabled' and 'anti-scrounger' you uncover the real root of the problem. It's because people have been moved onto long term sick to keep the unemployed count down that some people may well view people on DLA as scroungers. I can't honestly believe that any reasonable person would think that an obviously disabled person would by default be a scrounger but nothing would surprise me these days.

When you look at the 'anti-disabled' element you're talking about a few idiots who might think 'durr hurr cripple', not an actual group of people, surely?

true,Gessekai,flair8,,"**Update:**

Yesterday the Swedish evening paper Expressen made an update to their rumour that Rasmus Elm had signed for Spurs. According to BBC and Wikipedia, Expressen also started this rumour in the first place. Expressen originally stated The Daily Mail as source, but are now referring to unnamed Dutch sources and [Tribalfootball](http://www.tribalfootball.com/articles/tottenham-clinch-deal-az-star-rasmus-elm-ahead-man-utd-2557021) (who also refers to Expressen as the source).

What you need to understand is that Expressen (as well as the other evening paper Aftonbladet) is kind of, if I've gotten this right, like the Swedish version of The Sun - writes a lot of crap mostly. ~~But in reality the Swedish papers are even worse than The Sun, because there is no Page 3.~~

[The Expressen update](http://translate.google.com/translate?sl=auto&amp;tl=en&amp;js=n&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;layout=2&amp;eotf=1&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Ffotboll.expressen.se%2Flandslaget%2F1.2653197%2Fnya-ryktet-om-elm-fornekas-av-radgivare&amp;act=url) - via Google Translate (kinda poorly translated).

**To sum up**, the update featured a short interview with Elm's ""advisor"" Fhager. Fhager said that the signing to Spurs was taken completely out of the blue, and that Rasmus Elm would *not* leave before the summer, and Elm would *not* consider his career/future until *after/during* the European Championship.",0,1324130450,null,0,true,0,c38uxp9,t3_ndud1,t1_c38uxp9,t3_ndud1,1428035497,1,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,1

The UK is largely secular, but there are little remnants of its christian past, and I quite like tradition, and can appreciate that some things are the way they are because of religion, and I'm not really in any hurry to change them.

But when something new comes along, a politician is seeking to re-organise things, or some new piece of legislation is under scrutiny (and the 2004 Christmas opening act is a case in point) I can accept any good argument (and there are some good arguments for not allowing opening on Christmas day) but when those in power accept an argument stemming from an adherence to a specific religion, it immediately becomes divisive.

I'm slightly confused as I agree with you that the abolition of a bare minimum level of pay would be disastrous and lead to a substantial increase in exploitation and poverty. But the Tories opposed its introduction and sections of the Tory party are [actively pushing for its abolition now](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-13809620), so it's not unreasonable to surmise that we are heading for a battle to retain the minimum wage. Certainly with the pressures on Osborne to give employers more freedom to 'reduce red tape' (i.e. strip basic protections from workers) the abolition of the minimum wage is likely to be a serious issue in the near future.

true,bowling4meth,english,Straight out of Surrey,"&gt; I don't think that if questioned, the majority of people in this country would say they truly believe in a christian god

That's part of the problem. The question has never been asked. You may have the assumption because people in your social circle may agree, but I have a good friend who's a devout catholic, as is his entire family and a lot of his friends. I have other friends who live in different areas of the UK who say different things, some say that the locals don't bother with religion, others (particularly in NI and parts of Scotland) say that religion rather dominates things.

I think if the question was asked (and it's about time it should be) you might get a surprising answer. I would expect nominal christians to truly believe in a christian god, but one that fits their belief system rather than say no. Those that say no tend to have gone through the process of coming to terms with an absence of god, whereas 'nominal christians' don't - at least that's my rationale. There will of course be those who identify culturally and generically with christianity and describe themselves as nominal, I think they're more likely to say they wouldn't believe, but until the question's asked we'll never know.

For what it's worth I have a lot of nominal Christians in my family and I have asked them a while back about their beliefs.

Secondly ""He said: ""There were 27 hounds there and what I was witnessing, *though I didn't know at the time*, was our cat being torn to bits.""""  The huntsmen didn't have to tell the couple at all, the cat being so old they might reasonably have thought it had gone off somewhere to die. In fact it sounds like one of them tried to save it by pulling it out of the pack - this is a very very risky thing to do as he could very well have been bitten and seriously injured himself. 

Thirdly the article is skewed, it wasn't a organised hunt where they go kill animals - those are illegal, it was a ride out along public rights of way, the collective group is called ""a hunt"", since the ban it's just been a protest show and unless they keep happening then that entire pack of 27 dogs would be put to sleep as there would be no reason for them to be kept.

true,Squirrel_Army,troughton,Troughton,"It's presumed that Rose was the first after the Time War and the longest running (and only female) companion for Eccleston's Doctor. And considering Eccleston is the first post-Time War Doctor, he's got the most emotional baggage from the Time War itself. That's how I always explain away his ""special"" connection to Rose. This then carries over into Tennant's Doctor, explaining their relationship in Series 2 - because the Doctor's memories carry over, I'd assume he'd remember the warm, fuzzy way she made him feel. Which is fine with me. As I've said in other threads, the problems I have with Rose come from the Tenth Doctor's inability to move on afterwards.

As far as meaningful contact with other companions, I've always thought the Fourth Doctor and Romana II had the most seemingly romantic relationship in the classic series - mostly due to the fact that they're so comfortable together in stories like ""City of Death"" and ""Shada"" (not to mention the fact that Tom Baker and Lalla Ward were married to each other for a time, so that adds to the semi-romantic atmosphere). It's definitely not concrete, though. 

There's also the Grace-Eighth Doctor kiss in the movie, which is kind of hard to explain, though I'd argue it's somewhat similar to the stuff with Rose - the Doctor goes through a rough regeneration, wakes up in a morgue, and she ends up being the one who's there to help him out.

Northern Catholics study the Irish language, Irish history and Irish mythology in school, whereas Protestants focus more on British history. Catholics in the North celebrate many of the same holidays as those in the south, ex. St. Patrick's day, whereas very few Catholics celebrate the Twelfth. Catholics in the North generally think of themselves as Irish and the tricolour their flag, whereas Protestants often think of themselves as British and fly the Union Jack.

Are you referring to MPs, or their voterbase? because they've got enough voters to get in power, and there aren't enough rich people in the UK to elect one MP between them without the help of the masses...

&gt; They also moralise things that they shouldn't, encourage conservative/old fashioned views that often discriminate against minority's. A lot of them believe in an imagenery sky wizard too, which (to me atleast) makes them dangerous and irrational.

Do you think somehow that the proportion of religious people in the Tory party is less than that of the Labour or Libdem parties?

&gt; and like religious people, when I find out someone's a Tory I typically think less of them because I cannot understand what kind of person would every vote in such a selfsurving, morally superior bunch of assholes...

Ah, now you see you seem to be the exact sort of person that I started this thread about.

What I've observed is that you're:

  * Militant atheist
  * Cannot understand the concept of others having an opinion that differs to yours, or if you do comprehend it think worse of a person because of it

Clegg didn’t really have much choice on the tuition fees front for example, either stick with the coalition and try to fix the economy as best as Tory policy will allow, or walk out, keeping his integrity but watching this country eventually fall to something akin to the current Greek situation.

true,halo,null,null,"The vicious and hugely divisive neoliberal legacy of Thatcherism still looms large, not only in terms of generational poverty and long-term inequality. The influence of Thatcherite neoliberal values led to the embrace and deregulation of the financial sector culminating in a massively unbalanced economy over-reliant on a single sector that subsequently collapsed, leaving an economic chaos in its wake. Much of the UK's public debt was caused by the gap left from the sudden drop in tax receipts from the financial crisis.

The Conservative Party is seen as the natural party of the wealthy, big business, and Daily Mail-reading Middle Englanders and their implied values. This tends to manifest itself in a variety of ways, whether a commitment to put marriage in the tax system, cutting £1 billion of EMA while increasing the state pension by a record £3 billion, supporting the thinly-veiled bigotry of Section 28, calling for an Inheritance Tax cut that benefits millionaires, quasi-xenophobic half-baked pandering on immigration, ""repatriating powers"", Cameron all-but-endorsing nepotism etc etc. There is also a general perception that the Conservative Party doesn't care about addressing poverty or inequality which is cemented by how they generally address the issue and the editorial lines of the right-wing papers.

Please also remember that a political party does not need to appeal to 'the masses'. Parties need to appeal to the right people in the right seats, while the rest are essentially irrelevent.  UK elections tend to be decided by the party which manages to court the desparate demographics in the Midlands successfully without overly alienating their base. The Conservatives realise this more than anyone, as made clear by their disingenuous ""WE LOVE FIRST-PAST-THE-POST (p.s. we'll-change-FPTP-just enough-to-benefit-us)"" policy, although Labour remains split on the issue thanks to similar cynical opportunism.

I have two questions:


1. Why do people bogeyman the unions in this day and age? Union influence is extremely limited in public life, they have little active influence in Labour (remember union *members* get to vote on leadership elections, no block vote) and they represent ordinary working people. How exactly is Lord Ashcroft and other wealthy individuals bankrolling the Conservatives better? It's not the 30s (""they're secretly communists"") or 70s (""they'll take down the government!"") anymore. It feels like yesterday's battle that some old Conservative voters can't let go of.

2. Is it me, or has Reddit suddenly turned much more Conservative recently? I've seen quite a few The Telegraph and weird self-posts on right-wing issues. Co-incidence, or astroturfing from Conservative Campaign HQ/organised grassroots campaign?

Point one: mostly I'm taking about the politicians themselfs. I'm also happy to concede that not all tories are self serving, but as a political party I stand by my comment. But with regard to the voters, I honestly think that if you vote Tory you are either selfish, mis-guided, looking to punish the previous governments , or just don't care...or as you know...""iv always vote Tory"" in the same way you would never vote labor (which is kinda ironic don't you think) ?!
Anyway, any of those reasons are not the right reason to vote a party in, and as a result I would think less of them.

Point 2: i would say yes...but i have no way of backing that up, it would just be an educated guess based on their policies, and their education. In the last few weeks there have been two occasions where the Tory party have pushed religion. I can't and won't support that. 
Also pro Tory newspapers such as the Daily Mail back this up too and perpetuate nasty right wing overtones. 

Point 3: ""militant atheist"" - yep and I certainly won't be apologising for things that have no proof to back them up.
""people having other opinions, or believing that people are worse because of it"": not always - though I'm sure you would also agree that there are party's out there that are distasteful to you too?. But opinions are fine, it's very strange to be accused of that when frankly I would be happy to have any party in power that leads to a fairer system which properly supports the poor ect... If that was labor, lib dems, the green party....hell even the Tories (though they would have to change their policy's) it's all fine with me :) 
Name calling: yeah fuck it. I enjoy a good bit of swearing, it's good for the soul :)

Just reading your original question though... You ask why people are anti Tory when it would seem that most people/the Reddit demographic where not born then? Well, I was (just), I remember the pole tax riots, I remember the minors strikes (it's funny that people always seem to strike when the torys are in power). My father was also a member of the Tory party (once fell into a red rose bush while giving out Tory flyers ..true story:).  And as for my personal political standing - socialist and sometimes borderline communist :)

Glad I was able to help with your question though :)

true,LokianEule,mccoy,Time's Champion,"Okay, Doctor Who ran from 1963-1989 then rebooted in 2005. By no means do I suggest you start at 1963. You should choose between 2005 reluanch and 2010 when the new writer, Doctor, and companions took over. It felt very much like a re-relaunch.

Pros of 2005: you get to see more Doctors, more adventures, companions, etc. You won't miss out on it by skipping it. No prior info needed to watch here

Cons: It's a bit cheesy and the writing needs a lot of forgiveness the first two series. The show still shines though.

For 2010 Pros: Great writing, shiny new everything, same awesomeness that DW always has, fresh start, no prior info needed

Cons: You miss out on 2005-2009. You won't get to experience the show chronologically and see how things change and develop. You'll get spoiled by the special effects.

Even with these pros and cons, if you choose 2010 you should go back afterwards to 2005 and up. While the writing and effects may not be as shiny, there are still wonderful heartbreaking stories here, and both Doctors absolutely shine. Many people went on Who-hiatus because they thought the new guy wouldn't live up to the 10th Doctor. The ninth only has one series with some questionable writing, but he's a fantastic Doctor as well, and shines when given the chance.

Then I saw this snarling beast guy, and I noticed he had a tissue in his hand, and I'm realizing, y'know, he's not snarling, he's sneezing. Y'know, ain't no real threat there. Then I saw little Tiffany. I'm thinking, white girl, middle of the ghetto, bunch of monsters, this time of night with quantum physics books? She about to start some shit, Zed. She's about eight years old, those books are WAY too advanced for her. If you ask me, I'd say she's up to something. And to be honest, I'd appreciate it if you eased up off my back about it.

true,WombBroom,flair2,,"Preface: I don't mean for this to come off as dismissive or condescending, I'm hardly an expert on any of this, I just love to discuss tactics.  And I'm pretty high. Bear with me?

I would say that the formation you've outlined could be described as a 1-2-4-2-1 (CB/DM/DM/CM/CM/Wide Mid/Wide Mid/AMC/AMC/ST).  I think this formation would be very vulnerable to opposing wing play.  You're leaving Lennon to defend the entire right side himself, which I just don't think is feasible.

What Barcelona have shown a few times this year is more of a 1-3-2-3-1 (CB/LWB/DM/RWB/CM/CM/AML/AMC/AMR/ST, or Pique/Abidal/Busquets/Alves/Xavi/Iniesta/Villa/Fabregas/Sanchez/Messi).  This is based on the fact that most teams only play a single striker against Barcelona, who often is very disconnected from the rest of the team.  This means the Busquets/Mascherano CB/DM hybrid position is the position on the field with the most time on the ball, and is the starting point of many Barca moves.  It's also based on the fact that Barca added Cesc this year, who is playing in the AMC role, pushing Messi farther up, although he plays the same trequartista role.

For Spurs, this would look like:

CB: King/Kaboul
LWB: Benny
RWB: Walker
DM: Huddlestone/Sandro
CM: Modric
CM: Parker
AML: Bale
AMC: Rafa
AMR: Lennon
ST: Ade

Now, if you look closely, you could argue that Spurs have been playing this exact formation over the last few weeks, with Kaboul pushing up more to occupy the space a DM traditionally would, even though most people think they play a 4-4-1.  Benny and Walker push up so far that they could well be considered wingbacks, while Bale and Lennon also push up to the point they could be considered attacking wingers rather than traditional 4-4-1 wide mids.  I honestly think this formation is the way forward for Spurs, it would allow us to get Sandro or Huddlestone on the field instead of a second CB, and would also explain interest in Vertonghen, performing that CB role as a sweeper.",0,1324191308,null,0,false,0,c391gyg,t3_ngbvw,t1_c391gyg,t1_c38zr3l,1428038643,7,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,7

I don't see why dressing as a Nazi on a stag do is showing disrespect to anyone **but** the Nazi regime. The fact the only time regular people would wear a high ranking Nazi uniform on a STAG night. Is as disrespectful as it can get.

Lets be honest, most people now-a-days couldn't give two shits about the events of WW2 let alone know anything about them. It's like people see someone dressed as a Nazi and automatically assume it's in support of them, rather than a mocking. 

The fact that this type of uniform can be hired for such meaningless events is the problem, not that someone paid for it. Infact, stag nights are generally a collection of bad jokes and regrettable experiences anyway aren't they??

Just another case of people getting up in arms about something just because they can. I don't think many people would of deemed it acceptable to dress in German WW2 dressage in France anyway, but then again we're british and all european countries have to put up with us being probably the most obnoxious twatty tourists of all Nazi uniform or not.

That would be left with the Church's investments and the old churches, and use the former to fund the latter, making the rump of the established church effectively a heritage trust and a kind of religious equivalent of the Yeomen Warders or Knights of Windsor.

The spiritual leadership role of the Archbishop of Canterbury could then be delegated to a person elected by the Anglican Communion, leaving the Archbishop as a kind of Governor-General.

The disestablished part of the church would probably continue its slide towards progressive protestantism, with the more conservative elements drawn off to the Anglican Ordinariate as happened over women priests, gay marriage, and so on.",0,1324199335,null,0,false,0,c3925zl,t3_nfjdj,t1_c3925zl,t1_c38u889,1428038969,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

1. I think the relevance of the unions is less in this decade than it has ever been. Employment law has been tightened since the 70's/80's and the no-win-no-fee lawyer situation makes employment tribunals easier to obtain. So what is the point in the unions? All I can see is getting better conditions (note, not ""improving dire conditions"") and pay for their workers. So obviously you can see that from outside said unions it can be seen as holding the country frivilously to ransom.

&gt;* South-east of England - £792
&gt;* East Midlands - £311

1. South-west of England - £0.09
1. North-east of England - £0.02

I know they weren't much to go on in the episode, but they're a [Big Deal in regards to myth and legend](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tristan_and_Isolde). (Not so much now, as usually King Arthur stories overshadow them.)

I thought they were separate to the story like Robin Hood is, a completely different franchise if you will ""guest starring"" in Merlin, but I did a bit of digging. 

The myth is varied and wide like the stories of King Arthur are. There's a love triangle in Tristan and Isolde like there is with the stories of King Arthur. In the 13th century, [there was a story](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prose_Tristan) (an epic really) written about Tristan, in which he became a knight of Camelot. It is the first version ever found of the hunt for the Holy Grail; in the version he starts to set forward the idea of finding it, but abandons it to be close to Isolde.

The way this episode is set up (with Tristan hating King Arthur and his kind) seems to be with Tristan trusting and subsequently following Arthur into service. I am unsure about this, as the actor guest starring surely has a higher budget then most.

If, however, they join and Isolde and Tristan become regulars, I'll be very happy. Isolde would add a ""oh shit another female character HOORAY"" to the cast, and Tristan will introduce the Holy Grail plot (a big one to the story!) to the series.

Anyone else have any thoughts?

Downing, Henderson, Shelvey, Bellamy, Adam and Suarez starting should create enough chances among themselves to see off Villa today. We could move up to 5th today so a win is paramount.

**[edit]**

Need to stay switched on. We look well organised and solid at the back, we're getting good numbers forward as  well but I have to criticise the midfield who are letting Villa players run at the defense too often and look sloppy in the tackle. We also look slow when we win possession back. I can see us scoring from a counter if we pass quicker out of our own half but it looks good so far. Great attacking off the corners today. Shelvey has proven to be a good choice today.

**[edit2]**

Immensely frustrating, hitting the post twice again and wasting far too many chances. Even if we are 2-0 up we need to start improving a scoring record.

**[edit3]**

Good play from set pieces today, defended well again and managed to more than one goal. Still wasting far too many chances and showed a general lack of desire to punish Villa.

That and even the Economist has identified Ed Balls as being more of a friend to the city than either the Conservatives or the Lib Dems.  That the first thing Blair did in government was to hand more power to the City, power that hadn't been given under Major or Thatcher.  Whether it sits well with anybody or not, the FSA identified the Labour Government as the cause for need of the RBS bailout, and there has been more regulation introduced or proposed under the coalition than there was under Brown.  The coalition has introduced the Bank Levy and, written on Cameron's crib sheet when the EU treaty talks broke down,  a demand for UK regulation to *exceed* European maximums!

Going back to the 1990s it was the EEC that tipped the UK by not respecting their ERM agreements, regardless of which, 4 years after Black Wednesday, Major had balanced the budget and paved a strong  economic revival.  Blair-Brown had 7 years from the relatively small dot.com crisis in 2000-2001, but instead manufacturing was lost (directly because of government inaction), debt went up, and the deficit mushroomed; so when Goliath came calling in 2007-2008 no preparations had been made, no precautions taken.  Our David stood at hell's gates  armed only with a snowball.

People can say whatever they like about the Tories but it is observable fact that the nation was in a much better place when they left than what they found when they entered.  The exact opposite can only be said for the Blair-Brown-Mandelson architects.

Small wonder there's a Pavlovian whimper whenever, however briefly, the word 'Tory' is mentioned.  It's to the UK equivalent to what the word 'V-E-T' is to the family mutt.  They're constantly in the business of fixing the previous government's bodgings.

I'm glad the UK Tory party has died in Scotland and has a rift within it, I'm glad the Liberal Democrats have neutered themselves with a pro-EU stance, a poor show at the General Election when it really was their time to capitalise, and internal spontaneous combustion.  I'm glad Labour has a front bench compiled of Mr Beans and political lightweights unelectably compromised and owned by the unions.  I'm glad that there's a coalition that looks like it will go the full term.  The ground has been prepared for real multiple party coalitions, independents and protest votes.

Neither was available, so I ended up leaving empty-handed and buying them online, and for a cheaper price too.

It's entirely possible that the reason they didn't have them in stock was because almost half of the shop was filled with books, t-shirts, board-games, mobile phones and mp3 players.

If I want those items, I'll go to an electrical shop or clothes shop, etc.  What I want from HMV is CDs and DVDs.  Unfortunately, rather than becoming specialists in those areas, they've widened their stock to the point that they're now a jack of all trades, master of none.

It means he'd rather leave it to people to manage for themselves and would rather government didn't favour or disfavour marriage either way.

&gt; Makes about as much sense to me as ""Choice"" in the NHS and rings about as true.

Choice in the NHS meant empowering medical practitioners in the NHS to make more of their own decisions, to enable people access to money that would have been spent by their local NHS wards to spend where they choose - something which already existed if somebody was willing to take NHS money and spend it elsewhere within the EU.  If people thought they could get a faster, just as thorough, and cheaper operation in say Malta or Poland,  both with reputations as medical tourist destinations they could, both private or state.  The idea was that this should be a market opened up to NHS patients in the UK too.  The major problem those in the NHS saw with this is that it may lead to a bleeding of NHS budgets into the private sector, something that earmarking and ringfencing money that went to the private sector from NHS budgets for the next year could avoid, especially if it was grounds for extra NHS compensation in the following budget and a levy on private healthcare receiving NHS funds.

Fortunately, and ironically considering all the other protests concerning it, it was both UNISON and the BMA that stalled the 2011 Health and Social Care Bill originally pushing any decision back to 2013 at the latest, a deadline that has now been removed indefinitely.  So I wouldn't worry about it too much, the doctors and nurses are successfully squeezing the privatisation aspect for all its worth leaving nothing but dry pulp.

AMELI is the official site from the government agency (assurance maladie) in charge of this.

They says that intern are covered by the ""work insurance coverage"" from the company they are working for.

The fact that it happened during work give a special status to your accident, you have to notify it to your employer (in 24h) and they have to notify it to assurance maladie (in 48h) and to give you a special form ""feuille d'accident du travail (formulaire S6201)"".

You need to see a doctor and get him to fill in a special form.

Everything is on the site, basically you just have to sort out all the paper stuff properly but you will be covered 100%.

is essentially what the US has, and it is a terrible idea - all it does is add a middleman who skims money off, and provides little. If you want to raise more money, raise the proportion of tax that goes to the NHS, don't give money to someone else. 

More importantly though, I find your distinction between ""ideologically motivated"" and ""rational"" to be both unwise and rather chilling.

The point of a state-run system is to avoid situations where only the rich can afford health, and to stop healthcare being solely provided with a view to profit - with a privatized system, certain treatments will be unavailable, and and certain people will have no access to healthcare. 

The government's purpose is not to make a profit. Its purpose is to care for, and represent its citizens. Privatizing the NHS is not in the interests of the citzenry, but only in the interests of those who are currently solvent. It is a safety net for everyone, even those who do not need it.

No I'm quite content with forcing everyone to chip in for healthcare thanks. I choose to support a society that allows people access to healthcare as a fundamental right. There are moral arguments abound, but also the NHS compares favourably with other systems in terms of efficiency, cost etc. Apart from anything else it is hugely popular, and has a massive satisfaction rating. My personal experience of the system is excellent.

Is it perfect? No. Are the current reforms an improvement? I don't see that they are, and neither do many health professionals. That is open to debate though.

true,mistyriver,null,null,"Bill Haydon... let's have a chat then... If you keep insulting me, how can I refuse to engage in this discussion with you? I need to speak up for myself.

I'll do my best to dispel the stereotype you want to pin on me - by elaborating on the topic you asked me about.

Meanwhile, I'll also do my best to honour the subreddit rule:

&gt; Try to keep a positive attitude.  This is the UK subreddit; posts that seem to come from people coming here only to attack the country ... will be banned.

Yes... I insist that there *are* quantitative differences in the character of the citizens of different countries. These commonalities are, of course, not true across the board. There's endless variety in individuals' sensibilities. However, powerful trends of opinion can generally be seen across a large sample of people in each place. 

Incidentally, I just saw a comment thread started by someone at Reddit today who has lived no more than four years continuously in any given country his or her entire life. He [mentions](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/nhg0r/iama_person_that_has_spent_the_vast_majority_of/c394c65) that ""most stereotypes about countries are true in unexpected ways."" It's an observation which I might, in some cases, find myself agreeing with.

I understand something about the character of British intellectual discourse. In recent years, the BBC (which I watch via proxy over the internet) is really the only television programming I have found to be nourishing and worthwhile to watch. By comparison, even with hundreds of sattelite channels available in the USA - there seems to be nothing in American TV which interests me. In immersing myself in British current affairs, and culture in this way, I have seen specific strengths and weaknesses of British society.

 I have researched Australia, New Zealand and Canada the same way. The way people think and how they approach life is guided by how they were raised - how their parents treated them, and how they were taught in school. It's interesting how we, who live in Western countries, really make mountains out of molehills when it comes to people's skin colour. Yes, there are small differences in how people think and act when they come from a certain ethnic background. However, these differences pale when you compare them to how people live and interact and think when they have lived their entire life in a foreign country. There are even huge differences between very close sibling countries, like the UK and Ireland, or Canada and the USA. 

As a kid of European descent growing up in the States, I had many close friends who belonged to ethnic minority groups. Having seen the insides of their lives so intimately, I can tell you that they're far more like the white guy who lives down the block, than they are like a British person who shares their skin colour and ethnic history.

I'll tell you, I recognise that British people are very smart - they're probably the most intelligent across the board, when compared to people in other anglophone countries. I like that. Brits are very ingenious people. They invent. They innovate. As young adults, they are intently focused on wanting to pursue a certain lifestyle and career. People in the USA, in contrast, are less individualistic. They look for careers where they can make the most money, rather than pursue a certain personal dream, or develop a certain personal aptitude. However, this doesn't mean that Britain is better than the US. In fact, economically, the US system seems to work more smoothly. I think that materially we generally have a higher standard of living here - because when it comes to business and employment and all other matters of trade - people copy what works and use it themselves... rather than trying to reinvent the wheel each time, as Britons might be inclined to do. 

 Britons may be smart, but they're also extremely self-centered and somewhat brusque. This has been so clear to me as I, as an outsider, have been watching the trends of thought as British thinkers and politicians are interviewed as to their feelings about Cameron's recent veto at the European Union conference. The sentiments in the UK are quite the opposite of those of folks who live on the continent.

Americans - a people whom I've grown up with and lived with for nearly all of my years - I recognise as being a very friendly lot, but also they're not very adept at deep conversation or critical thought.

I've met several British expats and travelers who have noticed these same generalities I speak about regarding the UK and the USA, and we've chatted at length about it. 

Australians and Kiwis are different yet... they are quite fond of this manner of reasoning which heavily involves induction that you have an aversion to - thinking in generalities. You can witness this in [their debate programs](http://www.abc.net.au/radionational/programs/bigideas/past-programs/) which you can listen to or watch, over the internet. Intelligence Squared Australia is a very different forum from what it is halfway around the world, in Britain.

Canadians are very rationalistic. Like yourself, they don't like it at all when people try to form arguments and descibe systems using generalities. If you watch events in Ottawa via their government politics broadcaster, [CPAC](http://www.cpac.ca), you can see how everybody always backs up their arguments with scientific research. That is the gold standard in Canada.



National boundaries seem to be where the biggest shift happens. I see a whole lot more of a difference in sensibilities about the world between folks living in Ireland and those residing in the UK, than I see between the Scottish and the English, for example.

I realise that to criticise any society as a group is like touching the third rail when having discussions in anglophone countries... however, to see the world clearly, and to improve our own communities and nations, we need to compare our ways of approaching life with other peoples' and take note of where anyone else might be doing things better. Because we Westerners tend to think that all of our nations are more or less identical, culturally, and because there generally aren't bad feelings between nations in this century (unlike previous times) - I don't think I'm being unkind in frankly pointing out the things that I see. If people don't like it, they're free to blow me off and ignore me.


I can tell that Christopher Hitchens was influenced by his British upbringing in every way. It molded his character. Certainly his rhetoric softened as he settled into life, here in the USA. But that fiery ""wit"" of his was really exemplary of the British form of intellectual debate. Myself, I loathe that way of talking. I'm a gentle person. I believe in trying to help people with what I say - even when I think it's important to challenge them, or present an argument.

Sure - can I stop paying for schools (no children) and the fire department (well my house isn't on fire) while we're at it?

Yes, some people are a burden to the NHS because of poor life decisions, and that sucks. However, a lot of people become ill through no fault of their own (bad luck, in the wrong place at the wrong time, sheer statistics).

Healthcare differs from other costs in several key ways:

1. At the time when you need to pay, you are least well equipped to do so. Frequently your ability to pay is inversely proportional to amount to pay, in fact!

2. The amounts involved can be far beyond the typical person's ability to afford; cancer treatment would seem an obvious starting place for examples.

3. Cost is proportional to delay in seeking treatment (both by illnesses progressing within a person, and contagious illnesses affecting others). As such, encouraging people to seek medical attention as early as possible is likely to be typically cheaper.

You've asserted cost savings - have you looked at private care costs in the UK vs US? About a third cheaper here seems to be typical for dental care, for example.

You're also going to fall into the trap America does; unless you're going to actually leave anyone who cannot afford healthcare to die, the government still ends up footing the bill for many of the cases you've highlighted as problematic.

Upon regaining consciousness he was still within the first 24 hours of his regeneration cycle and so, as he put it (and other redditors here), had just enough excess energy to reform his hand.

I just think that the writing in season 1 and 2 were fantastic because the characters were crazy but fun and the storylines were so intense and you couldn't wait to find out what was going to happen next.

This season felt really flat. If season 3 was an entirely different show without any kind of history, I would have stopped watching the show before the season finished.

I'm hearing that it's now official than Iwan Rheon and Antonia Thomas are not coming back for season 4, which is extremely disappointing. I think it makes for a very bittersweet love story, but I can't imagine how they're going to continue with a majority of the original cast no longer  being a part of the show.

I honestly think that Defoe should start on Thursday as his pace could be really worthwhile against Chelsea's high line and Terry's slowness. 

Also, if Bale is out, we could try the 3-5-2. Walker and AEK as wingbacks, with Modric/Parker/Vdv in the center, and Defoe and Ade up top. This won't happen, as Harry never really surprises anyone with his line ups, but I think it could work. Even if Bale is not out, AEK could sit and Bale could slot in as the wingback. King probably won't play, so the back three would be Gallas, Kaboul, and Bassong. That's not ideal, but it's not terrible either.

Something to consider about religious parents who are happy for their child to go to a religious school and are happy about faith schools in general: How many of those parents, let's say Christian, would be happy for their child to go to a school run by a different faith, say Muslim?

My point is: Why should non-religious families have to accept their child being educated in a school with a distinct faith ethos (i.e. have their child educated *in* a religion they do not have themselves, and very likely not want), when a religious family would not like their child being educated in a school that was not *their* religion?

I disagree that a secular school cannot indoctrinate, secualrism is a value set in and of its self. It's not as if teachers in secular schools are totally nuetral in terms of morality. You wouldn't get them telling kids 'stealing might be wrong; i dunno people disagree'. If you see education as preparing a child for adult life then you really have to have an element of values and moral education. The distinction between secular an faith schools is how this aspect is taught.

I think parents should have the right to choose the values in which their child is educated be it them secular or religious.

true,widgetas,null,null,"I'm going to have to check you know what secularism is, as most people equate it with atheism. This is not the case: While most secularists are atheists (makes sense), secularism only (more or less) calls for the removal of religious privilege in society. As it happens, secularism protects minority religions from the majority. Secularism is not out to 'ban' religion or dismantle churches or close them or knock them down. Secularists simply want religion to be private, out of politics and out of schools. Amongst other similar things.

Muslims sending children to Catholic schools: Understandable. How many Muslim schools are there in Scotland? But I would hazard that if it were the other way around, you wouldn't get so many cheerful Catholics. Not all of them, but there will be a number who see the problem: Christianity being the state religion, after all.

&gt; I disagree that a secular school cannot indoctrinate

I thought you might! Let me be clear I am using the word ""indoctrinate"" as being specific to religion. I'm not sure how you can say that secularism is a value set... Because it's not a religious or moral framework. It's the notion that religion should be private and separate from the state. It says nothing about what you should or should not believe. This definition is more or less correct:

&gt; [*1. secular spirit or tendency, especially a system of political or social philosophy that rejects all forms of religious faith and worship.    
2. the view that public education and other matters of civil policy should be conducted without the introduction of a religious element.*](http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/secularism)

Note that this does not stop an individual or group being religious, but rather it ensures religion remains out of the sphere of public influence. i.e. No council prayers, no collective worship in schools. For a further distinction between atheism and secularism, [Hollyoake spoke about ""secular ethics""](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secularism#Secular_ethics) over a century ago. He coined the word so he's worth taking note of. There are of course those who want secularism to be anti-religious, but given that we already have certain equality laws in place, it's unlikely that anti-religion will actually win out. Nor should it.

&gt; It's not as if teachers in secular schools are totally nuetral in terms of morality

The *school* is secular - there is no religion over the name on the gate, none of the lessons have one particular religious theme all the time, there are no mass prayers for one particular god, there's no attending mass and, likely, no collective worship (even though that's still the law). Now of course teachers might be religious and attempt to use their religion in lessons to some degree, but it would not be very welcome particularly not if they teach their religion as being the correct one. On a side note: Did you know that faith schools can legally sack a teacher if they are not of the 'correct' faith? They can also sack teachers for being homosexual. [An attempt was made to correct this recently, but the amendment was blocked. By at least one Bishop, too.](http://www.secularism.org.uk/teacher-discrimination-challenge.html).    
Universal morals are taught in most schools anyway and you don't need a religion for them.

&gt;  The distinction between secular an faith schools is how this aspect is taught.

Yes. The problem is that faith schools teach children to follow one particular faith, even when it is very probable that that child comes from a family that does not have that faith. [BSA from a couple of weeks ago: 50% of people have no religion, 56% of those that do do not attend religious ceremonies.](http://www.secularism.org.uk/british-social-attitudes-survey.html) My point is that most families are not religious, but that in itself is irrelevant. Even if they did, the *child* is not that religion or should not be labelled as such, particularly at Primary school. Hence the Dawkins point (that was on here last week too): Calling a child 'a Christian child' or 'a Muslim child' is as nonsensical as calling a child 'a Marxist child' or 'a Conservative child'.

&gt; I think parents should have the right to choose the values in which their child is educated be it them secular or religious.

Fair point. So do I, to a degree. So could we agree that the church/religious institute can fund a school, rather than the tax payer in general? And that parents without religion should have the option of sending their child to a non-religious school? This is where the problem occurs and it should really be the opposite of what it is now.

Religious parents should be able to ask for/have religious *lessons* provided by religious organisations, but with the atmosphere of the school being non-religious. I don't understand how anyone can see it as being fair any other way. With the *majority* of families in the UK being non-religious/non-practicing, why is it still the case that faith schools get any public funding, let alone 1/3?

&gt;  In 13years of catholic school i don't think I was ever told that Catholicism was the only valid religion.

Schools vary and you appear to have had a good experience. Meanwhile a friend of mine didn't know that the Christian creation myth was just that, a myth, until she was 15. Her evolution knowledge is a bit crap as you'd expect.     
Can I ask: did you have to attend Mass everyday/once a week? Did you have Catholic prayers in assemblies and hymns?

We **should** be able to call on any player on the squad.  Malouda, however, needs to see that door (imo). Kalou didn't play terribly against Wigan, no. Did he add anything to our game? Certainly not. But in fairness, I wouldn't say he took anything away either.. he was able to maintain possession and his touch was on. Yes, he has also scored some big goals for the club. That said, I still don't think he has the consistent quality the squad needs. 

I understand the 90 minutes every week comment, I just don't get it being applied to Sturridge or Mata. Have you seen their movement, energy levels, and Sturridge(s) un-relenting speed? The man looks to almost never get tired. Of all players, why would the most physically fit not play the longest times? In contrast, we have taken their 90 minute opportunities and gave them to two ageing players, responsible for holding and controlling the entire center of the field for us, yet who can't run full speed for more than 30 minutes. (example: Drogba and Lampard last night). Am I saying they played terribly? No (at least not Lampard). All I am saying is: we are relying on individuals to do a job that their bodies will not allow them to do, instead of using the individuals who can do that job. Then, when the inevitable happens, and we stop attacking and concede goals (which we usually do), we're saying that we are not performing well because we are building to the future and integrating our youth.. I don't see how that fits exactly. I guess Drogba, Lampard, and Mikel are our future while Sturridge, Mata, and Romeu are simply bit part players. It'd be one thing if the youngsters weren't playing because the experienced players were still dominating and winning games, but it appears to be the exact opposite at Chelsea right now. I would also be okay with a lose or draw if it **was** because we were trying to get our youngsters experience this year. AVB: Don't apply tactics to the point of no return, you don't need to make a name for yourself. Just play your best and most capable team and win the damn game. If they get injured, guess what.. you put in the replacements. We just dropped two points and third place to a team with a game in hand on a ""what if"" (they get winded or injured).

Whilst he *is* our best midfield player, it's clearly tactics and coaching that's made the team so solid lately. (I think further evidence to support that case is that at the beginning of the season, we were letting other teams have good spells even with Lucas in fine form).

I think our midfield is so strong because: Adam seems to be fitter and more mobile than a couple of months ago. Henderson, who Lucas basically carried for a couple of months, is now settled in and is making a good contribution. (We haven't heard anyone complaining about him being a waste of money lately!). Agger and Skrtel are a better defensive pairing than either plus Carra as they don't sit so deep, and that compacts the midfield. Agger in particular is capable of stepping into midfield if we're up against opposition that plays 4-6-0 or a false nine drops off, so we're never outnumbered in the middle. And all the wide players are alert to when they should be compressing play and when they should be stretching it.

We'll always be better with Lucas than without, as he's really coming into his own as a player who can dominate games, but I think that if Adam, Agger and Henderson all start I'd feel confident against anyone except Barcelona.

&gt;Wanting something big and new

This was what I was trying to address, it it possible that it's not about what new shiny things, but about wanting to be on an equal footing as everyone else in your society? Whether owning an LCD telly *actually* means you are equal is irrelevant as a motivator. All that matters is that you think it does. In otherwords, the desire to be on an equal footing with other human beings drives our behaviour, not just our desire for things ie wealth.

I think the main point of my comment is that people need to be taught not to desire things they can't have. They need to be taught that material wealth does not necessarily mean an improved life. It's not something we instinctively know.

&gt;but why the difference between those who think ""Oh well, I can't have it"" and those who take an opportunity like they did?

Well to reiterate my point. The difference is they weren't taught any different. Of course this won't be the only reason, and I am only speculating I could be wrong.

true,[deleted],null,null,"I don't equate secularism with atheism. I am a secularist and a beiever in god. i'm not going to get into  sematic argument with you over what 'indoctrinatioon' technically does or does not mean. 

If you are objecting to religious schools based on the idea that they push their beliefs onto pupils, I have got to say your being selective in your objection. There are no universal morals, there are ones which are near uniiversal but even in teaching them you are excluding those very few who disagree (for instance i think that children should be taught that murdering someone is wrong even if they have brought shame to your family). I think this is exclusion is healthy sometimes but we have to recognized it always exists.

Yes secularism is a very loose value set, one which includes a lot of varying views (your and mine foe example) but it values the independance of religion from public affairs. It makes value judgements. What I am saying is that while no one should be forced to attend a faith school, they should have the right to educate their child in (with very few limits) the value set of their choice.

&gt; So could we agree that the church/religious institute can fund a school, rather than the tax payer in general?

No, sorry we can't agree on that. The government ought to provide education that as many parents as possible will find suitable. This means having a variety of schools. Your objection to faith in school is not more or less valid than my enthusiasm for it.

&gt;And that parents without religion should have the option of sending their child to a non-religious school?

No children need god in their lives and depriving them of this is tantamount to murder. Just messing with you there. Yeah obviously that should be the case. I don't think anyone seriously argues otherwise. It's like asking me 'can we agree that people should be able not to go to a particular church?' well... yeah!

&gt;I don't understand how anyone can see it as being fair any other way. With the majority of families in the UK being non-religious/non-practicing, why is it still the case that faith schools get any public funding, let alone 1/3?

I've gotta disagree with you line of thinking here. If one family wanted their one kid to be educated in either a religious or secular manner, and the entire rest of the population were of the other persuasion. I think the government ought to provide for that one kid. 

In term of Mass, on holidays of obligation (Ash Wednesday etc) and in primary school we went on the third friday of the month. We also got hymn practise once a week and did moring and afternoon prayers in primary school.

I'm ordering this reply very poorly sorry about that.

On the Marxist child note. My attitude towards religion and morality is similar to that to my attitude to language. Is it really fair that your parents deiced what language you speak and so define you a urge amount of you cultural input and the borders of your social interaction? Not really, but you need to speak a language to become and adult. Like wise you need a moral compass, be it faith based or not. WHo if not the parents should decide this? You might think my parents were being unfair in choosing to raise me a Catholic without me having a choice, but they raised me an engish speakr without me haivng a choice either.

Your point about sacking teacherss for being gay or not being catholic are just not true in terms of the Scottish system either. I doubt they're really true in England or Wales either but I can't say for certain. My Primary school Head was gay, my Dad's Deputy Head (he was a HT of a catholic High School) was gay, art teacher was gay. Most of my teacher in HS were at best utterly unobservant Catholics and I'd suspect about 40% were protestants, there was also at least one Sikh teacher and one Jewish teacher at my school.

&gt;Christianity being the state religion, after all.

Nope established church in Scotland is the Church of Scotland. Not general Christianity, and defiantly not Catholicism. I would send my kid to a Muslim school over a secular one, all other things being equal. I can;t speak for all Catholics though and you ought not to either.

I wouldn't say the creation story is a myth. It's an allegoric story. Saying it didn't really happen is like saying that 'Animal Farm' didn't really happen, kind of missing the value of it. Your pal sounds a bit daft tbh. I don't remeber gettin many detailed evolution lessons but then again I didn't do Bio I did physics. Everone I went to school with knew about evolution and the big bang.

Schools might vary but I went to a catholic primary and two catholic secondaries, my mum taught in a catholic HS for 30 years and my Dad was the Head of a catholic school for 14 years and is an advisor to the Scottish government on education. I can say with confidence that Catholic schools don't push religion down the necks of non Catholic pupils and they don't try to shut out the possibility of other religions to Catholic pupils.

Instead, they seem all too willing to award the contracts to the same old big companies and consortia with histories of delivering late (if at all) and massively over budget.

Stolen, by a guy who knew me no less, and crashed. The bugger ripped the plate off the back and tried to hide in a field. The police officers who came across him were pretty bemused when recounting it to me as he had crashed infront of them. Insurance refused to pay out.

2nd bike: Honda CG 125 commuter. Stolen from main road. Disc lock on the backwheel. To get round that they lifted the back wheel up and started to wheel it away. They were caught about 15 meters down the road and when questioned they said they were simply wheeling it back to the owner. That then got processed and I had to pay the £150 recovery charge and the extra for the days it was held.

3rd time. Similar situation except it had 2 disc locks and was under a nearby store's CCTV. Come 12am I get a phone call from the police and I knew instantly what was up.

4th time. steering lock, 2 disc locks, chained to a lamppost and a wingmirror removed. Suddenly...GONE. 3 weeks later parts of it has been recovered and a load of under 18s are responsible so they can't be named. Wonderful. Insurance paid out though as I went with another company.

With a 125cc they're always popular because all you need is a CBT and you can ride them with learner plates. Because of this they retain their value really well in the second hand market and always fetch and alright price.

Today, most of us routinely leave a trail of personal information behind us – from emails to idle thoughts on Facebook, to images of ourselves grinning at parties. Go to a live event and instead of lighters in the air, you'll see the glow of people recording proceedings on their smartphones. This final episode, starring Toby Kebbell and Jodie Whittaker, and written by Jesse Armstrong of Peep Show, Fresh Meat and The Thick of It fame, explores the logical outcome of this, something many might consider a fantasy scenario: what if you had a kind of Sky Plus system for your head, so you could rewind and replay memories at will? You'd never forget where you left your keys again, for one thing. And it would be great for winning arguments. But it might not be brilliant news for the health of your relationship.

I get the feeling that your problem isn't with public insobriety but rather the actual act of consuming alcohol in public, based on the assumption this leads directly to distasteful behaviour.

Whilst I can relate to your concerns - as I said, we've all been faced with rude, obnoxious or abusive drunks on our travels - it is important to recognise that public drinking *in itself* does not cause this anti-social behaviour and, as such, it will not be stymied by the abolition of drinking in public. 

Your compare the acts of drinking alcohol and smoking weed, and state that you would never do either in a public place; I'd like to point out that the illegality of the act of smoking weed has done nothing to prevent you from partaking, in much the same way that making consuming alcohol in public would not prevent the ugly behaviour we all abhor so much.

TL:DR; anti-social behaviour is not caused by drinking in public, but by people who are anti-social.

I'm sure they'll come up with a solid explanation to get around the 12 times thing.  You have to remember that with the majority of British Television most tv shows have limited runs.  maybe 1 or 2 series before completely ending them (which I prefer as a show rarely ever gets to the point where it's no longer relevant unlike US counterparts where they keep milking a show until it gets really, really, weird) So I imagine they implemented the 12 regen rule because they never saw the show going beyond that.  However Doctor Who has always stated something and then gone back and changed something all the time.  The Doctor can say something but then a few series down the line whatever he said can be thrown out the window simply because the doctor lies.  something that was really enforced in series 6.  Just like in the 1996 movie where we were told that the Doctor is half human and then a few series later we found out he was simply lying about that.  

Doctor who changes all the time and while some changes are good, others i'm not too happy with.  for example the new Daleks in the Matt Smith series I don't really like.  When they all came out in multi-coloured forms I thought ""eh, they look like something Apple would make"" If I were to see a neon-green Dalek I wouldn't know to run or laugh at it.  Also the episode with the weeping angels on the space ship.  Before it was scary that they would transport you to another time and that's how you died...from old age.  In the new series it was ""oh they'll just break your neck and kill you.  seemed like a lame cop out to me.

I remember being at a football match that was particularly exciting and went down to that last seconds with both teams scoring last minute goals. The away team scored first to equalise, this caused the away supporters to cheer and gloat. Seconds later the home team (who I was there to support) scored to win the game. The home crowd erupted, and I with them. It didn't turn violent, but for a few seconds I was ready, eager for it. What I assume was an undercover police officer started filming the away crowd, this shocked me out of my feeling of empowerment and I looked around. Not just young men, but women both young and old, and teenagers all pointing at shouting at the away fans, some hurling abuse.

I'm sure you can see where I'm going with this. I wonder how many of those people in the crowd at that football match feel vaguely ashamed of the way they behaved on that day, like I do? Being 'as one' with a crowd like that is a bizarre thing. I wonder how many of the rioters and looters also look back and think, huh? Why did I behave like that?",0,1324315637,null,0,false,0,c39e6ej,t3_niaou,t1_c39e6ej,t1_c39cszk,1428044925,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2
