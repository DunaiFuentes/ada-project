true,sirbruce,null,null,"&gt; I'm not a healer. I'm a scientist and an engineer and a builder of things. Is this just a line to get building plans or was that originally his focus, and if so when did it change?

It changed with Troughton.  The 1st doctor routinely pointed out that he wasn't a medical doctor, but the 2nd doctor showed some flashes of medical knowledge in The Highlanders and The Underwater Menace, and then admits in The Moonbase to having a medical degree and doing a lot of medical stuff in that episode.  So somewhere in the first few episodes of the 4th season the doctor must have spent some time away studying medicine.  A few times after that he says he's not a doctor of medicine but then we see the 3rd doctor in full-blown medical research mode in Doctor Who and the Silurians.  After that he usually displayed at least some medical knowledge.

* Leela and Andred are the Doctor's parents (Lungbarrow, intended as a joke)

* It's true and was a deep dark secret (in Bodysnatcher EDA book, I think)

* It was only the 8th doctor and he regenerated into a half-human and it happened because of the events on Human Nature (7th Doctor book), I don't know where this one started (probably Gary Russell), but there are oblique references to it in Taking of Planet 5, and Apocalypse Element.

* It was a trick using a half-broken chameleon arch (IDW comics The Forgotten)

* It totally didn't happen (sort-of implied in Journey's End)


Bearing in mind who's making the show now, the most likely explanation is a combination of the 3rd and 5th explanation: only the 8th Doctor was half-human, but because of the Time War/Crack/Bottle Universe/Faction Paradox/Time War now he isn't, and never was.",0,1309497668,null,0,false,0,c22yweg,t3_idw67,t1_c22yweg,t1_c22yrrn,1427303354,7,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,7

But as plain and simple Doctor Who I think it's pretty damn good... and I dare say the revival in 2005 would have gone a lot different had that movie not been made. I think they clearly stole a bunch of ideas from that movie for the new series, and so I feel the people who worked on the movie should be given at least that much credit :D

I don't know why you think I might be for some sort of revolution or some sort of centralised anything. 

Yet, since we live in a massive system, one place you have to look to for change is among the powerful parts of that system. 

By and by, change will come now by way of a collapse. The sooner it happens the better because whatever misery it brings, it will be worse the longer we wait. 

At the same time the ""Democracy is the best system we can think of"" platitude is, at best, devoid of meaning and at worst wrong because humans have had other social systems which seemed alright. The dichotomy you and others accept that there is either democracy or autocratic socialism seems entirely false to me and refers only to the last hundred years of human ""civilisation"". 

Anyway, I am interested to know how you think things will evolve. As far as I can see, the general public are left out of the picture. There is hardly any element of democracy that actually allows a voice, on a national level at least. 

I would like to see the public strike, stop shopping, and show the rich we can hurt them. Or a massive movement to grow one's own veg or something like that. The guillotine can wait.

But it's increasingly difficult for me to get a visa because of the fact that these wild generalisations are thrown about which causes the government to go all Madagascar on immigration. What does that mean for me? I'm struggling each time I have to renew my Tier 2 visa (which I pay a princely sum of £550 just to attempt to apply for, and no refunds if they ""run out"" of the quota) when I'm going to be doing a job that very few people can do. What's worse is that the point system is getting harder and harder to beat, so that unless you're coming with packets of money or, hilariously, an MBA (which is shockingly worth more points than a PhD), and add to that the quota system - you have a very difficult time getting in. So it's not the non-EU migrants that you need to worry about, and in fact the government is shooting itself in the foot because it's keeping out lots of highly skilled people that would actually stimulate the economy and could improve employment rates. 

This article is very confused because it switches back and forth between youth unemployment (largely unskilled labour) and skilled labour. The welfare system for Brits here makes it so that it's actually better to be on benefits in many situations than it is to work an unskilled labour job. So who works those jobs? Those who have to to stay in the country (because they don't qualify for benefits). i.e. migrants. 

The government needs to get the welfare system straight, rethink the EU free movement to work stuff and make it a real level playing field (by bringing back the hoops like for non-EU migrants), and stop paying lip-service to uninformed citizens (who stir up the hue and cry about job-taking) by actually cutting out the high skilled people they need to have in the country. But yeah, I don't really see the point of the EU either. 

Just frustrates me when I see people yelling ""omg they're taking our jobs"" and then the government acts on that, but because of EU stupid laws the only group they can act on is the one group that actually probably helps the economy, i.e. the high skilled migrants, i.e. me :P 

ETA: this doesn't mean that all EU migrants suck though, I didn't mean to imply that. There are definitely some very skilled and excellent EU workers.

A lot of people in that movement are the people who are on strike today and they'll be looking at you and thinking, 'well, you're describing these strikes as wrong.

You not quite getting your head round this are you? All reporting involves the 'censorship' (as you so delicately put it) of someone or other. Not every line in an interview makes it to the page and rightly so because otherwise, the news would be full of gibberish. What I'm taking issue with is the fact that they're are taking a barely related matter and inflating it to suit an agenda they suport. Now, I don't have a problem with newspapers having agendas as to some extent, that's their reason d'etre and I don't have a problem with people having opinions that run conter to my own. What I do have a problem with is editoral distortions that try and link together unrelated events in order to push that agenda.

Do you mind me asking what their Masters degrees are in?  Qualifications aren't the only thing that lands a job, it's the whole package, which would also explain why it's possible to get a ""cushy job with prospects"" without qualifications past GCSEs.  Willingness to relocate is a big factor with finding a job too.

This is one of the harder topics to reach a definitive answer for though.  Ultimately it comes down to the difference between someone 'deserving a job' and the employer picking them; it's not fair but the latter party is who sets the unemployment figures.

I'm one of the 'foreign workers' (legal immigrant). Feel free to AMA, but here's my tuppence:

1. I'm pretty much in [leidra's boat](http://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/ie0tp/firms_urged_to_hire_uk_jobless_not_foreign_workers/c22zoed), i.e. I'm considered a 'skilled worker' for immigration purposes

2. As someone who's been in the tech industry for a little while (5ish years), I would never work for anything below market rate for my qualifications and experience. I'm not sure why a skilled migrant with any amount of experience would do so - maybe they've been here a while and can't find a job? This has always struck me as strange - loads of companies are whining about a skills shortage..

What I'd like to know from some of the UK redditors is:

1. is this burgeoning unemployment only in the unskilled sector? i.e. people competing at near or just above minimum wage levels?

2. How is this unemployment calculated? is it just the number of people that are on benefits? If so, then what about the people [like this](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-south-east-wales-13990987) who are on benefits just because they're lazy? I'm not sure what the benefits pay is like, but if it's close to minimum wage levels then I don't see why someone would work as a burger flipper when they could simply arse around all day and get the same amount every month.

These are genuine questions I've had for a while now. For the record, I've been here only for about 4 months so I might not be fully informed.

true,Ivashkin,null,null,"&gt; By and by, change will come now by way of a collapse. The sooner it happens the better because whatever misery it brings, it will be worse the longer we wait.

There won't be a collapse, certainly not on a global scale.

&gt; At the same time the ""Democracy is the best system we can think of"" platitude is, at best, devoid of meaning and at worst wrong because humans have had other social systems which seemed alright. The dichotomy you and others accept that there is either democracy or autocratic socialism seems entirely false to me and refers only to the last hundred years of human ""civilization"".

You miss my point, democracy is the best system for governing relatively huge populations, we tried a variety of different government styles in the early 20th century and they all fell apart. It doesn't mean it is the pinnacle of government, but just that right now we haven't figured out a different way of doing things that would be better. There is some interest in collectivism, or anarchist societies, but so far they only seem to work on a very small scale. If you watched the series All Watched Over by Machines of Loving Grace, the 2nd episode touched on this, and the problems they faced. But don't for a second thing that I consider democracy in it's current interpretation to be the ultimate form of government, it's simply what works the best in our current world.

&gt; Anyway, I am interested to know how you think things will evolve. As far as I can see, the general public are left out of the picture. There is hardly any element of democracy that actually allows a voice, on a national level at least.

What I want to see happen is more regional devolution, a more localized form of government. ANd I think this will happen. Having looked at this, and the last few previous administrations it is becoming painfully obvious that a centralized state, in particular the one we have in the UK today, is unworkable. There is no way a room full of 30ish people can effectively govern a nation with a a population that is going to hit 70M inside 20 years. Things will have to become more devolved because people want the decisions that effect their lives to be made by people they can engage with, and not politicians living in London who communicate via sound-byte.

&gt; I would like to see the public strike, stop shopping, and show the rich we can hurt them. Or a massive movement to grow one's own veg or something like that. The guillotine can wait.

People are stopping buying things, or just buying them in different ways. The vast majority of the things I buy are via Amazon marketplace, from small traders. The big firms, especially retail stores, stock stuff I don't want, and prices I won't pay and I don't want to go shopping.

And the vegetable idea, is a damn good one. If you see council estates, how many of them have vast tracts of green space that are home to nothing but a poorly maintained ""lawn"" full of signs that using it for fun will result in fines? Why not encourage people to use these spaces for food production, on a community basis. People can eat healthy food for cheaper than the Iceland crap they currently are financially forced to eat. That's a 38 degrees campaign right there.

The only piece of new information in the emails is that the reactors already had the facility to be able to inject seawater in an emergency.

In the emails it states quite clearly that it is part of the design, and that it's know that it would ruin the reactor.

My favourite quote from the emails is this:
""The explosion while visually dramatic is part of the safety system, the building has protected the reactor.""
The melt down and explode safety system operated perfectly. :)

I would not be surprised. I work with many foreign labourers and most follow the same pattern. They get their transport over here provided on tick and get provided help with paperwork and finding work, they then sleep 2+ to a room in a house owned by the same person/'company' who arranged everything else.  Any money that they don't spend paying back their handlers is sent back home or saved. 

You would not go to a country to work and provide for your family back home only to piss all the money away on crap. Do you see any foreign labour down the pub on the weekend? Driving around in expensive cars? Down currys buying a flat screen?

Well at least you contradicted that bit of hyperbole. It's limited by infrastructure, investment and many other things.

Terror attacks should be excluded from nuclear safety tests, just as McDonalds or Tescos should be excluded from assessing terror attacks for their products and that it should be left to the security forces.  With terror attacks you're left with an endless list of 'what if' scenarios.  You could argue the British beef industry could be targeted by organised terror organisations and wholesale laced with botulism.  They don't factor it into their business model because the security forces are already paid to prevent it.   Same goes with terrorists attacking a nuclear installation.  That's not to say that nuclear companies don't address security or freak accidents.  They still preempt an aircraft crashing into a facility, they still preempt a derailed train or a fire.  They still preempt a crazy person trying to infiltrate a secured facility, and they factor it all in.  They just say that they address potential faults and that people that would be inclined to cause those faults or hazards comes under another remit.

The dual-elephant in the room is always going to be that (a) affordable energy consumption does have to be met and there isn't a valid alternative for the next couple of decades, and (b)  in reality we're going to realise commercially viable hydrogen fuel cells in the next 20 years, supplanting the reliance on petrochemicals for transport, only that requires massive energy production in itself to produce hydrogen on that scale.  I'd hate to have that technology land in our laps, for the good of the environment and national security, and not to be able to capitalise on it because we can't produce the electricity or the heat to mass produce the plentiful raw hydrogen on the required scale.  The IVth generation nuclear power plants are being designed especially for that with the earliest working model expected around 2020.  They're never going to happen if faith isn't placed in the III generation models and if the false public perception isn't addressed now.

The UK just did 50 years with I and II generation power plants, can they do another 50 with much safer III and IV generation power plants?  Of course they can, and by that time alternative and renewable sources *will* be a viable alternative.

In the end they can get quite good at it, its menial admin work but at least its a job that pays over minimum wage, because the agencies take an equal amount to the salary they have no chance of getting hired. Even worse, the companies treat them with no respect because they don't have to and lay them off at the end of the week.

A race so vile that once sexual congress becomes impossible they try and destroy the multiverse rather than accept the fact that other species might outperform them sexually.

The situation was resolved by The Doctor using the ultimate phallic symbol - the sonic *screw*driver - to eradicate all other time lords from existence.  Ultimately leading to the larger problem that The Doctor becomes a phallic war like God ruling over the universe, using his power to spread his degenerate male narrative over all space and time.",0,1309550295,null,0,false,0,c232y0y,t3_icdgf,t1_c232y0y,t1_c22mdxb,1427305327,1,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,1

You're led around by an actor or actors, you run through corridors, you're properly involved in the production. It's like an extreme version of a fairground house of horrors.

Bit of a tangent here but I think it's the best way to properly explain this type of show: The best one I've been to was in a building underneath a train station in Glasgow, around twenty people allowed into each performance (some were planted actors) and it only lasted about twenty minutes. It was centred around the idea that they'd just found a crashed spaceship deep underground, thousands of years old with no signs of life. We were in a room listened to a commando guy tell us that we needed to switch off our phones or other electronic devices before we went in to see the ship, then as we were moving through the next corridor a phone rang in one of the plant's pockets. The commando stopped dead, properly terrified, and next thing we knew we were running a different direction being chased by aliens. Lights were going out and guns were being fired. As we went from room to room we kept seeing little glimpses of the aliens silently stalking us and things like that. At one point I had to hold a door shut with somebody banging on it from the other side, then screaming. At the end we were in a lift with no power, the commando was messing with the control box while somebody held a torch for him. He got the doors closed just as an alien tried to get in but couldn't get the lift to move. Then the torch went out, its batteries dead, the commando was working in the pitch black trying to get the lift working but accidentally opened the door and the alien grabbed the nearest person an hauled them off. That gave us a chance to make a break for another corridor and up some stairs, where the performance ended.",0,1309551886,null,0,true,0,c23343w,t3_ied3h,t1_c23343w,t1_c2326s0,1427305407,2,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,2

As for the linked article, I don't really agree with what is being argued.

I am completely out of rum, so my brain is not working at full thingy, so please excuse me if being dense.  You say yes to it being a throwaway joke, emphasis on the *joke*, but then no to it being throwaway - I'm not understanding why the distinction.  Is that because you're saying we're supposed to not forget the Tardis is alive?  And that calling her Sexy reinforces this?

Anyway, all I mean is that the 'joke' was the doctor usually uses sexy as an adjective to describe the Tardis, most frequently followed by 'thing', as in E501, 'Oh you sexy thing'. But that the Tardis's confusion over language and time meant she confusedly took the Sexy as her own proper noun.  And I guess my point is that some of the people calling her Sexy now are really dancing like that this is actually her real name for real, when the Tardis itself is just so much bigger on the inside, etc etc etc, god, this paragraph just won't quit...

In summing up, I tend to prefer *not* to be slapped in the face, both metaphorically, and um, ouchily, but that's just me.  Hmm.  Why is there no rum?

Jamie glomming onto the Doctor when the lava is about to hit the TARDIS was terribly cute, and Zoe putting the martial arts moves on a comic strip character (evidently the Second Doctor doesn't know Venusian aikido yet). Everyone was so huggy and grabby with each other. Admittedly, I was a little sad that we only got to see Zoe's shiny behind all over the console, but I guess they weren't really thinking of female fans at the time (no lingering shots of Jamie's butt in his kilt? for shame.) They both sort of straddle the line between being competent (again, Zoe fighting and Jamie adventuring) and useless (screaming, wandering off, etc).

Troughton is someone who instantly feels ""Doctor-y"" to me. Hartnell kind of does, but he's kind of of the edge of the spectrum. He was doing a lot of hand-wringing in the beginning, which wasn't quite what I expected, but once they got into the nothingness area, his quick recognition of the puns and stories was definitely all Doctor. The ending ""battle"" of wits was a joy to watch, and the whole""I mustn't make myself fiction"" was both a cute sort of meta jab and put some interesting restrictions on the battle. After all, writing about yourself, without explicitly mentioning yourself, is pretty hard.

""The Master"" certainly seemed like The Master while he was doing his ominous voice-overs, but once the reveal happened, he turned out to be a sort of Wizard of Oz-esque character, in over his head. This definitely reminds me of some of the old Star Trek TOS (and even a few TNG) episodes--bodiless brains controlling things, fictional characters coming to life. I don't mean that as an insult. It's just the vibe I got.

I did not really agree with this argument. When I have driven in the U.S. I have always found it to be much easier than in the U.K. Perhaps because of the huge volumes of traffic, the drivers seem less aggressive than in the UK.

The main issue with roundabouts is that you have to make a judgment about when to pull out into the stream. If you are too aggressive you might force a car on the roundabout to brake, and if you are too timid you may never get onto the roundabout. So you either need enough roundabouts that everyone gets used to them, or you don't have them at all.

You are on a dual carriageway (two lanes) approaching a roundabout.

You intend to go straight across (12 o'clock) - this would be the second turning as there is first a turning off to the left at 9 o'clock.

Would you position yourself in the left or the right lane before joining the roundabout?

I learned approach and join in the right lane as that way I don't block the flow of those leaving at the first left. 

I find quite a few people seem to think if you go straight across you should join the roundabout from the left lane?

true,racergr,eu,-,"I'm Greek but I live in the UK. I had a hard time to understand what's going on with roundabouts. There are two problems:

1. 99% of the junctions in the UK have clear markings on who has the right of way. UK drivers just look at these markings. This is not true for other countries. We apply rules instead of looking at signs all the time. I.e. in Greece, those coming from your right have right of way (, unless the junction is marked by signs of traffic lights of course). 

**Conclusion:** As a non-UK driver, when I approach any junction, I will intuitively decide that either I or the rest of the traffic has right of way. When I have the right of way, I will look for a bright red ""STOP"" sign. If I don't have this, then I have right of way. **It is very unlikely that I will look for ""stop"" lines painted in the tarmac, I am not trained to check these.**

2. In British roundabouts, the rule reverses itself, you need to give right of way to traffic coming from the opposite direction than in any other junction. To make things worse, there are no clear ""STOP"" posts, just some painted lines, which are harder to notice, especially amongst the confusion.

** Conclusion:** put ""STOP"" sign posts in roundabouts. 

**Edit:** Yes, I should have said ""yield"" sings instead of ""STOP"" signs (there is little difference when there is traffic coming from where you want to go). But seriously, are you guys downvoting me because I spent 20 minutes explaining what the problem is? How are you supposed to solve something without understanding it first?

I had just had a two and a half year relationship collapse in front of my eyes in the most horrible and humiliating way I could imagine (I walked in on my much older boyfriend and a stripper having sex). I was upset, and alone. So, I turned on the TV. There was nothing on, except for a show that my few friends all raved about. So I turned it on. And I was hooked. It was the Titanic episode. And when that man, that strange, wonderful, fantastic, impossible man stood in that hallway, and announced who he was: ""I'm the Doctor. I'm a Time Lord. I'm from the planet Gallifrey in the Constellation of Kasterborous. I'm 903 years old and I'm the man who is going to save your lives and all 6 billion people on the planet below."" I knew that everything was going to be okay. No matter what happened. Yes, its fiction. But its also the best of my world. When the new season began, I found myself loving the tall, gangly Doctor just as much as the quick talking, sexy one. It was everything I loved- history, sci fi, and brilliance all channeled into one show. Like most Redditors, I'm a bit of a brainy outcast at my school and in life. But Who changed that. Other Whovians at school came out of the woodwork. And I found, for the first time in my life, friends.

Within some time, my mother caught on to my love of this show. And then I made an unusual discovery of my own. As a child, my mother lived with her abusive mother and step-father. Her only time of solace was between 3 and 5, after she let herself in after school, and before they got home. This was when a show was on the local station, a show about a man with crazy hair in a brightly colored scarf, who brought happiness, light, and silliness into an unloved little girl's life. That man was, of course, the Doctor.

I don't know why the Doctor affects people this way. Maybe it's his charm, his wit. Maybe it's his silliness. I can't pinpoint an exact reason. But in the Christmas episode, I think Matt Smith hit on it. The Doctor believes and knows that everyone is important. Every single one of us. And he will solve problems, he will fight evil, and he will win, because we are worth saving. And that's the Doctor.

When the Doctor fills his life with people just as mad as himself and loves them, rather than treats them as defective, when he adores psychiatrist-biting Amy and manic-depressive Vincent and even loves the Master when that maniac deserves it the least -- it makes me feel right at home. I know the Doctor wouldn't treat me as broken and defiled -- I know he would care about me rather than pity me.

When River told the Doctor to not re-write one single line of their painful, crazy, wonderful future/past, because she would be damned if she'd give any of it up, because the experience made her who she is, I could begin to believe that maybe none of my own past had to be rewritten to make it okay.

Yes. But the equipment in the telephone exchange that processes calls is connected to the rest of the telephone network via a fibre optic cable.

The wife'll want a new kitchen, bathroom, etc.  We'll have a big party, fly friends in from around world, and blow a wad of cash.  Still got £73million, though.  

I'd stick £5m in the bank which would give me a salary of say, £100k per year for the next 50 years (being optimistic).  I'd stick another £5m in a trust fund for each of my kids (I'd figure out some interesting incentive to encourage them to work and make their own money, not just live as rich kids).  £58m left.

I'd give a million each to my sister, brother in law, mum, dad, mother-in-law and 3 nephews/nieces.  £50m left.

I'd give half of the rest of that (£25m) to various charities. 

With the remaining £25m I'd build a bunch of world class skateparks dotted around the country.  Then wherever I was, I wouldn't be far from a great place to skate.

Easy. Do I get the job?

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt; What do you mean exactly? ISPs using old lines need to get their act together. ""Virgin did better, but that's only because they use better technology!!"" is not a defense. The customer only cares about performance and reliability.

Virgin's issue is the fact that the connection between you and their network is shared with everyone in your neighbourhood. So your 50Mbit connection is sharing the same bandwidth as the other hundred or so houses in the area. So peak time slowdowns can happen - that's why Virgin (on the non-50Mbit services) cap your speed if you use it too much, and they traffic shape P2P regardless.

The ADSL ISPs don't have that issue, but they have the issue of diminishing speed as you get further away from the exchange. That's why BT is installing fibre to the cabinet/premises, thus reducing the distance considerably.

&gt;  ISPs using old lines need to get their act together. 

Because they can flip a switch for that? It's expensive to do that. Virgin (aka NTL and Telewest) have their tin-pot network, but they amassed massive debt trying to build it and they had to file for bankruptcy protection. Ever wonder why Virgin has made no real expansion of their network (to the point where new build houses sometimes can't get it)?

The other ISPs are mostly reliant on BT to get things done. BT has the financial clout to undertake this kind of project on a huge scale - and they're finally doing it, with fibre to the cabinet and fibre to the premises services becoming available in a lot of places.

&gt; When 100MB comes out we're getting it to share and he is ditching his current ISP.

Have fun with that.

I'd buy a bunch of green-field spaces and allow people to use them to run free/low-cost festivals.

So it's not just like BT FTTC (aka Infinity as sold by BT). I would argue that BT's network is more worthy of the ""fibre optic"" label, because the fibre goes closer to the home, and it doesn't have the same capacity issues as Virgin tends to have.

You **are** aware that the entire 21CN project is rumoured to be in the billions of pounds and is perhaps one of the first projects of its kind, if they pull it off successfully (not many major national telcos are effectively ripping everything voice/data out and starting again with a new IP network, right down to every exchange). So far they appear to have the core up and running, and are now dealing with the access network (ADSL2+, VDSL, fibre)

Equally, the fibre broadband pursuits are not cheap - and those core network upgrades are making it possible.

So don't try and make it out as if BT aren't flashing the cash (admittedly some of it public cash, to upgrade unprofitable areas). They certainly are.

&gt; Just like the {insert utility} companies, they'd rather rape the existing infrastructure than pay to replace or improve it.

Some of the utility companies are crap, some aren't. My water company is £rape when it comes to rates, but it has spent a metric ton on ripping out old pipes and replacing with new - and we haven't had a hosepipe ban sine the 90s.

Point taken, but I see that you neglected to mention my point about the kind of sudden backlash against nuclear power that we saw in Germany recently.

To adapt a software engineering example, when generating electricity you want the solution to be cheap, low-carbon *and* scalable to a national level. The problem is that you can only have *two* out of the three. Nuclear isn't cheap (Yes - Government subsidies will be required) but if we are to continue to have (inter)national power grids and maintain the commitments to reducing CO2 emissions, then I believe that nuclear is the only feasible option given current technology. Fusion is the dream, but it's going to be a dream for a long time yet I think.

The above is predicated on the assumption that a low-carbon, national-level electricity grid is what we want achieve and maintain. The engineer in me quite likes the thought of a number of smaller local-level grids which could conceivably be run from renewables, leaving just the requirement for a small number of conventional plants (Coal, gas, or nuclear) to provide stable output for large population centres. Coupled with massively more energy-efficient devices, I really think that could work but I'm not holding out much hope of it actually happening.

So: Fukushima. Serious accident, yes - but it takes more than one thing going wrong to cause an accident. In the case of Fukushima it took two major natural disasters (each of which exceeded the plant's design spec) occurring within the space of an hour, compounded by failure to implement a safety system (hardened hydrogen release vents which would most likely have survived the tsunami and prevented the hydrogen explosions) that is standard elsewhere.",0,1309650535,null,0,false,0,c239wyr,t3_if5vn,t1_c239wyr,t1_c239o29,1427308683,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

Compare Haye's speech with Klitschko, and where Klitschko talks very respectably about the fight and the people (even going so far as to thanking the Brits...???) with Haye's constant whining and comments like ""Oh yeah I could beat him but my toe was killing me so I couldn't make that explosive hit"" or something along those lines.

He just came across as someone who was a real sore loser. He only begrudgingly gave 1 sentence to Klitschko about him being good, but I remember he then went on to say he could  beat him if his toe wasn't so injured.

And again, his whole body is bruised and battered. Hell, Klitschko didn't go easy on him and Haye took some heavy hits. Why is he solely complaining about his toe when he sustained far more serious damage during the fight?

I watched about half of it, and liked it, but I was on dialup at the time and couldn't be bothered to finish. I was a sophomore in high school, busy with one of the only two high school classes that ever really challenged me and a busy extracurricular schedule.

My next introduction to Doctor Who was through roleplay, in college. One of my friends and I would adapt media the other was unlikely to see as a roleplaying game, as a way of sharing what we liked without forcing the other to sit through something miserable due to the format. I had introduced him to some of my favorite video games, and he told me to bring an OC, any OC, to adventure with the Doctor. I grew attached to the Doctor's whimsy, his brilliance, his quirky sense of humor, and his ability to take people out into situations that would make them shine. 

So then I decided, ""When I go back to college in the fall, I'll watch it on Sci-fi.""

The weekend I got back was ""Human Nature."" What impressed me was watching Martha, this apparent maid, in a position of weakness next to the all-powerful Doctor, kick butt and take names for him in his absence. 

So I guess what I like about Doctor Who is this:

1) Whimsical sad doctor
2) Companions growing from normal people into superheroes

I am also a sci-fi enthusiast and an English and history teacher, so I am also digging:

3) Sense of adventure
4) Sci-fi politics
5) Historical fun!

There was no sudden backlash against nukes in Germany. They have always been strongly anti-nuke. There was a plan made years ago to close down all their nukes - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_phase-out#Germany - but the conservative government reneged on that last year. Merkel simply u-turned following Fukushima. She did what the vast majority of Germans wanted - that's known as 'democracy'.

Don't get distracted by the minutiae of why Fukushima happened. It's the same as all accidents - something happened that was not expected or not planned for. It will happen again at another nuke - it's just a question of when.

Nukes fail on all counts.

* Nuclear Power Won't Fix It. Nuclear power is not the answer to tackling climate change or security of supply, according to the Sustainable Development Commission. ""...even if the UK's existing nuclear capacity was doubled, it would only give an 8% cut on CO2 emissions by 2035 ... nuclear power has benefits, but in our view, these are outweighed by serious disadvantages. ...it is indeed possible to meet the UK's energy needs without nuclear power. With a combination of a low-carbon innovation strategy and an aggressive expansion of energy efficiency and renewables, the UK would become a leader in low-carbon technologies. This would enhance economic competitiveness whilst meeting the UK's future energy needs."" http://www.sd-commission.org.uk/presslist.php/51/nuclear-power-wont-fix-it + http://www.sd-commission.org.uk/publications.php?id=344

In season 2 she ended up just being a ball and chain that the Doctor carried around with him, save for a few memorable moments where she was more. 

Not only that her character diminished both Martha and later Donna. For Martha the entire first half of season 3 was her trying to get the Doctors attention, but never stacking up to Rose (which if you were to compare them is really pretty sad) in his eyes.

Then Donna, my favorite companion for 10, gets royally fucked by Rose. The end of season 4 should have been about Donna, Donna becoming part timelord and saving the day, and Donna loosing all of her memory, essentially dying for us. Yet I felt that her moment was diminished by Rose and her attitude through out, and the second Doctor which was pretty much created so Rose could have a toy in the other universe. So when Donna was lost to us, it seemed much more like a footnote at the end of the season, rather than a grand goodbye which is what Rose got.

So I guess, if you want to sum it up, I hate Rose because her character far outlived her welcome for me.

2) I agree. For instance, are you familiar with the so-called [Birthday Paradox](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birthday_paradox)? My reaction to that, was certainly ""no, that can't be true, it goes against common sense."" But it's not hard to go through the reasoning and convince oneself of it's truth. 

However in general, I think going with what seems reasonable to you, based on times in the past that you've looked into similar sorts of things in more depth, is sensible, though nowhere near as good as actually looking into the matter oneself. So, whilst not actually having looked at the physics, biology or empirical data myself, I find his proposed massive spike in damage at low levels of radiation to be odd enough that I'm skeptical of his science.

3) Certainty in mathematics can't really go to far -- only faith in the applicability of certain bits of mathematics to nature can go to far. Mathematical modeling has generally been very successful in science, so it's reasonable to continue thinking that the second best way (after direct empirical data) to understand the effects of radiation on living organisms is still mathematical modeling.

I think it must be because of deep lies that are fed to workers to put them off the trail. 

I admire the WSWS for trying when the opposition is huge! I think I read on their website somewhere that they encourage workers to avoid trade unions and form independant unions which are represented by the workers involved?? 

but, I think firstly the workers need to experience the betrayals of the trade unions to recognise the WSWS or search for them??

Workers surely will look for a group who will represent and guide the workers on how to achieve their rights and I'm pretty sure the WSWS will be there for the workers when they turn to them;)

There's a decent amount of live music in various pubs and places if you look hard enough. I believe the Purple Turtle is the student place to be for indie/rock/metal, has the odd live show, and is where the university rock music society hangs out a lot.  The Bullingdon Arms on Cowley Road often has live gigs on most nights, including an awesome (free) jazz set every tuesday night, and anything from blues/punk/country/rock the rest of the week.  The Regal and the O2 Academy (both on Cowley road) are where the big names generally play.

&gt; Loves me a good pub and meal out aswell.

There's no shortage of amazing and characterful pubs in Oxford -- the Kings Arms (aka KA), The Turf, The Eagle and Child, and The Lamb and Flag (all city center) are all very popular both with locals and the tourists.  I'd go on about some of the lesser known ones but really there's just too many to count!

&gt; I'm just getting started in professional writing (news reporting at the moment) so I'll have to look into that scene once I get there.

Would you be looking for a paid job, or voluntary work? I did a bit of voluntary photography with The Oxford Student newspaper last year, just for fun -- as they're a student-run publication, they're a bit short of cash.  The other student newspaper is the Cherwell which is actually published independently of the university, so may be slightly more promising for paid work.  Both newspapers are of a pretty high quality for student publications, from what I can tell.  The local 'professional' paper is The Oxford Mail, which you might want to look into.

As long as it doesn't actually matter to the story, random references to old episodes do occur. But if Moffat wants to do one thing and an old episode says he can't, then he'll do it anyway.

I know he's aware that it's an old show. But I see no evidence that he feels bound by rules laid out in the older episodes.

Which is not all bad, of course, because not everything from the old episodes was completely brilliant, but it means that ""X happened in an episode 20 years ago, therefore Y has to happen now"" simply doesn't work.

No - he's said that it doesn't need to be addressed, not that it will be addressed.

I'm still not 100% certain that the dreamlord is going to be back.

true,abw,cnty-uk,Surrey,"There's a small (by Glasto standards) festival in my home town: [Guilfest](http://guilfest.co.uk).

In [this article](http://surrey.greatbritishlife.co.uk/article/guilfest--history--music-theatre-comedy-and-more-in-guildford-21903/) the organiser talks about the first festival in 1992: 

&gt; These were more innocent days for music festivals; they weren’t the sponsored, corporate entities that many are today. A couple of toilets and a small scaffold stage (or trailer) was normally deemed more than sufficient – as long as there was a bar. These days, health and safety regulations and the sheer rise in popularity of festivals mean that the quality has improved significantly. However, it’s also made them more expensive to run.

Until a few years ago it was a really chilled affair.  Good music, good vibes, no hassle from anyone if you just wanted to sit in a big tent and share a fatty boom batty with some random strangers.  Then a few years back the police decided that they were required in force and that the festival organisers should [pay £36k](http://www.getsurrey.co.uk/news/s/2050053_guilfest_policing_to_cost_36000) for the privilege.  I believe they also demanded a significant rise in the number of professional security guards required on site (as opposed to the mostly volunteer workforce that previously ran the gates) or they would object to the licence application.  I also read somewhere (on the Guildford council web site, I think) that they had increased the ""cost"" of the licence from £free to £57k.  So in one year, the festival organiser had to find an extra £100k just to clear the red tape.

As a result, the festival has become just that little bit more mainstream, more commercial, and less fun (all my own opinion, of course - yours may vary).  Of course, I'm also getting older which may account for it.  Perhaps this year I'll just stand at the entrance to the festival, wave my walking stick and shout ""get off my lawn!"".

My grandfather always used to say ""You hear about those people who did win the jackpot, they didn't have any kind of inside knowledge, they didn't know they were going to win. They just went out and bought a ticket like normal. Someone's got to win."" Of course they don't, but everyone's got to have a dream.

And that's what the lottery is. You are, literally, buying hope. The hope that by some fluke everything will get better overnight. You're purchasing the fuel for your dreams.

If I actually *did* win, I'd probably take a few days to sit down and properly plan things out with my family. There would be a strong urge to run out and just buy the most expensive things, but that often leads to ruin. First off I'd hire a professional accountant, because I'm wise enough to know I know nothing about handling large sums of money. I'd probably hire an investment banker to advise me on what to do with my money because my long-term goal would be to earn vast sums of interest off my winnings and set me and my family up for life.

Then once my money was safe and invested properly, THEN I'd go nuts. New car, expensive house (but not mansion sized, I don't really see the attraction), a round the world holiday with 5 star hotels every night... :D

After a time once I'd bought everything I ever wanted and got bored of jet-setting around the world, I might buy/start a small business to keep myself busy.

**TL;DR:** The lottery gives us hope, even when we know we'll statistically never win the jackpot. I'd want to be sure my winnings were properly invested if I did win, and even then step carefully; I don't want to waste my golden opportunity.",0,1309777676,null,0,false,0,c23irfv,t3_ieymp,t1_c23irfv,t3_ieymp,1427312919,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

The US has a similar problem of people voting against their own interests in this respect. Stateside it's because the people feel they themselves will be in that tax band once their American Dream pays out; I'm not so sure if this applies here as well.

It's not the same attitude as the US has with Joe the Plumber types and the American Dream, these are people who are concerned with the 50% tax band purely because they are paying 50% tax and would like to pay less tax. They will still self identify as working class despite this.

&gt; Agreed if we are talking about the traditional forms of class as observed by /r/proper i.e. manners, clothes &amp; lifestyle. In terms of day-to-day financing and genuine social mobility the old distinctions are very much alive. Particularly now that higher education creates debt that scares off the poorest; in the past that was the best way for someone who is working class to jump up the scale to middle class.

I would argue that it is not higher education that is the problem, it is the lack of grammar schools (in a modernized form), the lack of German style technical/vocation education in high schools/FE colleges and the lack of apprenticeships. Our education system attempts to treat people equally and this is flawed, which causes problems before people even consider filling in a UCAS form.

I would also argue that the changes to HE funding are subject to a lot of misinformation which leads people to believe they cannot afford university. The actual tuition fees may well be higher, but the repayment scheme under the new system is actually beneficial to those from poorer backgrounds, as they start paying it back at a higher wage point, and they will pay back less. Ultimately it is the amount of money you take home each month which is the important thing here, and under the new system this will be higher, something that will be helpful to those from lower income backgrounds. But then I would argue that we should have just gone with a graduate tax rather than loans, the same repayment system re-branded as a tax, less paperwork and less debt stigma (which is the main issue with the system we have now).",0,1309778588,null,0,false,0,c23islb,t3_ifrq8,t1_c23islb,t1_c23iqh6,1427312933,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

I wouldn't support this, but if someone is actually caught heaving a brick through a starbucks window, they should be stopped from doing so, or arrested if they have already done this. If you make exceptions for this type of behaviour then people can make exceptions for doing the same of a mosque because of their views on Islam. At the end of the day, the police are there to uphold order in society and part of this is preventing people from smashing stuff up that they don't like (for whatever reasons they have).

How best to measure the costs of commitments that go a long way into the future is controversial. Those who want to claim public sector pensions are unsustainable try to express all these future commitments as if they were a bill that had to be paid today. This produces some scary numbers but is a completely inappropriate measure given the long term nature of pensions.

The NAO and the Hutton Commission both rejected this approach and said that the test of the long term affordability of public sector pensions is what proportion of GDP future payments will require.

The NAO found that even before the switch to CPI indexation the cost was sustainable:

    Government projections suggest that the 2007-08 changes are likely to reduce costs to taxpayers of the pension schemes by £67 billion over 50 years, with costs stabilising at around 1% of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) or 2% of public expenditure. This would be a significant achievement.

Public Accounts Committee, The impact of the 2007-8 changes to public service pensions

Once CPI indexation is taken into account the proportion falls clearly. The Hutton report (chart 1.B) shows that the central projection of future costs (before any further changes) falls from 1.9% of GDP to 1.4% by 2060.

true,haywire,eng-sussex,Brighton,"I think it's an interesting article as it does demonstrate the mentality and worldview behind this man's conservatism.

It's horribly misinformed to assume that ""punk"" means ""anarcho-capitalism"", as the author illustrates.

Worldviews like this also ignore the fact that a) modern anarchist, especially left-wing anarchist thinking is based on looking at previous mistakes and trying new things - improving and changing in order to become a better theory of how things should be run. Just because Anarchism didn't work 50 years ago, it doesn't mean it wouldn't work now - times have changed, and the philosophy has been revised and improved.

Giving up on people and seeing them as bad, an unable to escape human nature, seems logical given the history of humanity, but severely neglects the huge amount of good that humans do day in, day out. There are plenty of historical examples of how much of the time, people are forced to do evil simply because of the situation they are in - for instance in WWI when they played the game of football between the trenches. Millions of men killing each other. Why? Not because they were greedy or evil, but because they were ordered to by a state, with it's own absurd interests.

Anarcho-Communism is in a large part about removing the motivations we have to do evil - financial gain would become worthless because property is shared, for instance. It's about making self interest most effective in benefiting the group.

Unfortunately, the author of this article has applied his own aspect of anarchism (commonly referred to as anarcho-capitalism) to the entire punk movement in order to shoehorn it into fitting his argument. He has also provided some examples of how supposedly left-wing governments have turned into regimes. Perhaps a history lesson would benefit here, because in modern society, generally left-wing governments are destroyed not only by internal power struggles, but external influence. There are a great many examples of Western, capitalist interests undermining and toppling governments. For instance, Thatcher was buddies with the horrendous bloke known as General Pinochet. He was a right wing, free market leader, and that turned very sharply into a fascism which did untold damage to it's opponents. Soviet Russia faced the difficult situation of having insane amounts of pressure heaped on it by the capitalist world because the West feared that it would succeed, and undermine capitalism (and the wouldn't want that!).

What I'm saying is, that in reality, the reason many left wing experiments have failed is not due to their nature, but due to practicalities, external influence, and corruption due to not having checks in place to prevent people like Stalin taking the reigns.

The author's viewpoint reminds me very much of a Police Officer. They see the worst parts of society every day, and it ruins their worldview to the extent that they see their job, and the Authoritarianism it implies, as the only real solution to their perceived reality.

So, the guardian's ""*extreme* right"" purely because it's a business? That might make it more inclined to be biased to the right than some form of non-business news outlet would be, but it's still substantially to the left of most news outlets in this country, so I'd hardly call it ""extreme"".

&gt; the BBC state propaganda UK's answer to Fox news!!

There's so many things wrong with that I'm not even sure where to start.

* The BBC is *completely* different to Fox News, in terms of organisational structure, sources of funding, editorial standards, and, yeah, pretty much everything else too. It's a terrible comparison.
* The BBC's state-funded - surely that'd make it more inclined to be left-wing? You can't dismiss the Guardian as ""extreme right"" purely because it's a business, at the same time as dismissing the BBC as ""extreme right"" despite it *not* being a business.
* The BBC's charter shields it from state influence - they're allowed, if not encouraged, to criticise the government. They're no more ""state propaganda"" than any other news outlet.

If I've not already made myself clear: I'm not disagreeing with the idea that most British news outlets tend to lean to the right, in terms of, say, the midpoint of the [Political Compass](http://politicalcompass.org/analysis2) (see the ""international chart"" down the bottom). However, our country's whole political landscape is skewed to the right by that metric!

I only object to you dismissing everyone as ""extreme right"". The very definition of ""extreme"" demands that an extreme is an out-lier! If every major news outlet looks ""extreme right"" from your perspective, I can only say you're way past the left of this country's [Overton Window](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overton_window).

Published July 3


This Sunday, Steven Moffat, this year’s guest of honour, held conferences and a master class at Comic Con Paris. During the panel on the most recent series of Doctor Who, the writer made several revelations.
Interviewed by Alain Carrazé and Romain Nigita from 8 Art City and by members of the public in the room, Steven Moffat first spoke about the recent confusion regarding the number of Doctor Who episodes to come.
According to him, “Contrary to what you may have heard, there will be the same number of episodes next year.” 


At the end of the conference, Steven Moffat returned to the subject to add: “There will indeed be the same number of episodes. But there will be a change to the mode of diffusion. I’ll explain all that. Later.”
Additionally, Steven Moffat confirmed that the BBC has already approached him regarding the festivities for the show’s 50th anniversary in 2013. He said that their intention is to create the best year possible for Doctor Who fans. Their plans are very ambitious.


Questioned by a member of the public on why he keeps killing Rory, Steven Moffat indicated that Rory was only truly dead once. And besides, even if he often “killed” the character, he brought him back to life just as often. Calling himself a romantic, he indicated that people should not worry too much about the character. However, he did add that “Rory’s repeated deaths are leading up to something. There will be a pay off.”
Finally, the head writer of Doctor Who returned to the character of River Song and the final revelation of the first part of Series 6. Do not read the following if you have not seen all of this season.


Spoilers!


He did not know who River Song was when she first appeared in the Library. However, when Amy was introduced and he called her Pond, he knew where it was going to lead. Certain things may not have worked out. There may have been some changes. But everything turned out more or less as expected.  However, Moffat hastened to add, “when it comes to River Song, you don’t know anything yet!”

Establishing the menace of an enemy by showing how much the characters fear it can work, and has to great effect on Doctor Who before, but it seems to have backfired in this case.

There are so many loose ends to tie up at this point, I'm wondering if it's actually possible.  I'm starting to feel like I did at the end of season 2 of Lost, when I realized that they were great at writing interesting mysteries and not so great at solving them.  

I'll admit that RTD's approach was a bit more pedestrian &amp; fluffy.  But, I enjoyed picking up the occasional clue (""omg, wft is Bad Wolf?!"" or ""omg, wft is on Donna's back?!"") and knowing that it would be neatly solved by the end.  I can't make any judgments about the current season until the end though.

As for the finales,  I actually **hated** the end of season 5 when I watched it live.  I mean really, Amy wishes the Doctor back into existence with the stupid wedding rhyme relating to the TARDIS?  And, how was River on Earth to give Amy the book given everything that's happening now?   And, loved the end of season 3 (probably cause I had super crushes on both the Doctor and the Master).  

But, I just rewatched everything since the reboot.   3 seemed super cheesy and I really enjoyed 5 the second time around.  I think I was suffering from unreasonably high expectations the first time I saw season 5--I loved Moffat and at the time I felt like the end was a cop out.

Although they are only filling the house's with imigrants, once all the locals have been forced out they deport the imigrants and sell the land. Much of the areas the imigrants where initially moved into are now gone, flattened so they can build ""villa's"", private companies of course.

Over the last 2-3 years they have started doing this with the house's I live in and they plan on demolishing all these in the next 5 years (most of them have only been standing for just over 10) again they'll sell the land to private companies &amp; make a fortune, &amp; we'll be left with nothing.

In terms of the imigrants, what you find is the good people get deported as they are not wanted, or easy to deport because they are honest productive citizens, we get to keep the rapists, muderers, drugr dealers &amp; people trafficers etc because it would be against their ""human rights"" to deport them to a country where they face jail, torture and or execution for their crimes.

true,redmel98,null,null,"OK  I’ll admit I wrote in hast;) however, you have opened up a whole different debate in the chart you give as examples of extreme right and extreme left it says:  
“If we recognise that this is essentially an economic line it's fine, as far as it goes. We can show, for example, Stalin, Mao Tse Tung and Pol Pot, with their commitment to a totally controlled economy, on the hard left. Socialists like Mahatma Gandhi and Robert Mugabe would occupy a less extreme leftist position.”
These examples of extreme left are not extreme left they are extreme right. An organised economy in one nation is still under the influence of the right and is simply out for their own profit interest. Socialism has never been achieved because it would have to be on an international scale for it to be any opposition to the right which is on an international scale.  
Stalin was not left he was a dictatorship. I understand socialism as an organised economy organised by the workers not the bourgeois therefore this table does not outline extreme left and extreme right, it simply outlines right and extreme right? These examples in the chart still try to solve economic problems under a capitalist system, I mean Ghandi?? He was religious!! Not left?? I see left as Trotskism, Marx and Engels Scientists in the field of political analysis. 
As for the media being extreme right in your terms, if extreme means to lie then yes I still stand by this point, because according to your chart our government is right, however according to your chart Hitler is fascist extreme right...which leads me to thinking wasn’t he supported by the Daily Mail before the 2nd World war and Church hill. I don’t think everyone is extreme apart from myself? I think the society we live in is mis informed to suit right wing political agenda and falsifications are given and opinion to encourage these political agendas. Isn’t this lying?  according to you...extreme = lying? Therefore, extreme right media.

Animal seems to  is going that way, too.

Fat Face and Weird Fish are both good quality.  Fat Face styles tend to be a bit more ""rugby/polo"" whereas Weird Fish are a bit more ""surf/skate"".  Superdry quality looks pretty good, although their tops are all slim fit so I can never find anything I'm comfortable in (being a fairly broad shouldered person who like their clothes baggy).

Jack Wills is overpriced fashion tat, in my opinion.  Avoid it at all costs unless you absolutely *have* to be in the trendy set (although it's probably not trendy any more).

Comparing this to ""extreme: the point located farthest from the middle of something"", I hope you'll see what I mean by the similarity in meaning between ""extreme"" and ""outlier"".

I feel you've missed the point I was aiming for. As I see it, whether an idea is ""moderate"" or ""extreme"" (or even ""left-wing"" or ""right-wing""!) is dependent on the social context that idea is presented in. That's what the notion of the Overton Window is about.

Take, for instance, healthcare. On the left, nationalised healthcare; on the right, free-market. Nationalised healthcare is considered an extremist policy by many in the USA, and free-market healthcare is considered moderate. In most of Europe, the reverse is true, as the Overton Window is differently placed.

An ideal world's Overton Window might stretch from, say, a ""left wing"" that's a bit left of your views, to a ""right wing"" somewhere to the left of today's ""centrists""... but I feel it's best to define the scale of ""extreme right, moderate right, centrist, moderate left, extreme left"" exclusively in terms of the current social context.

Extremism is a social construct; ideas are labelled ""extremist"" when society finds them distastefully far from the social norm. As such, I still can't agree with your claim that every major news outlet in this country is ""extreme right"". They have a wide readership; I infer from this that a large segment of the populace agrees with them; as such, I would call them ""moderate"", not ""extreme"".

Some popular news sources, like the Telegraph, lean more to the right than the average; as such, I'd call them ""moderate right"". Others, like the Guardian and the BBC, lean more to the left than average; I'd call them ""moderate left"".

In the social context of our country and our time, I'd call the WSWS ""extreme left"", as the majority of Brits would find its analysis ""too"" left-wing. In today's society, most people find, say, scrapping basic capitalist constructs like currency and personal property to be unappealing, so doing so is labelled ""extremist"".

On the other hand, well... those Milton Friedman-worshipping fatcats at the [Cato Institute](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cato_Institute) (""the financial crisis was caused entirely by regulation!"", they cry) - now *that*'s what I'd call *extreme* right.",0,1309804989,null,0,false,0,c23kmf7,t3_id2ze,t1_c23kmf7,t1_c23k03d,1427313803,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

Absolutely it should, but...

Sigh.

Given the performance of the Met during the original investigation the problem may well be far more serious than the PCC being toothless.

I fear that some hack will indeed get a lengthy prison term, all the papers will be disgusted, the News of the World will issue some gut-wrenching apology and it will gradually fade from conciousness. Coulson, Brookes and Murdoch himself will suffer no ill-effects.

Before the war, the situation in Iraq was pretty shocking. The country was *already* destroyed by the previous gulf war and sanctions made it worse. If you read my link above then you can see that, by some estimates, a million people had already died as a direct result of the sanctions.

So as an influential leader you have three choices:

1. continue the sanctions (indirectly killing thousands of children)
2. invade Iraq and bring down the dictatorship
3. strike out in a completely radical direction and defy the sanctions

Option 3 sounds the best but is basically unworkable unilaterally. So you are left with the other two options, either of which will result in thousands of deaths. You could argue that an invasion a least draws the situation to a close.

Even with hindsight I don't know what the best choice was.

Also, Donna was really screechy in her Christmas Special, but I think she actually started being awesome from day one of her own season. Right from the start she's tough, principled and an important part of the doctor's success and direction.

I just rewatched the first two episodes of season 4, and in both of those the doctor couldn't have done it without her, and she shows great strength of character. I actually kind of feel that Donna's annoying voice ties in well with her character backstory (perhaps accidentally) - it allows her to be tough and smart without being remotely attractive. It's a way for her to... Hm. This idea is less clear in my mind than I thought it was, when it comes time to express it. I guess it allows her to stick to her guns without actually claiming any self-worth. To fight for the right thing, without it being about making her look good, sort of thing. Sort of, ""I'm a nobody, but you are *not* going to let those people die.""

I guess the appeal of it to me is similar to something I've observed in the past about the slightly Socratic nature of the internet troll's staple of ""umad? lolmad"" - by which the speaker always means ""I'm clearly an idiot and so are you!""

Tennant really blows me away when it comes to his performances. Not so much the big things he does but the little things, like how he's more of a silent Doctor when it comes to his emotions. He wouldn't just go on a pissed off rant, he would keep it in and actually show some pain and suffering for the burden that is being all powerful as well as the last of his kind. What really weighed him and the Ninth down were the companions, none of whom I liked. Which is why I like the Eleventh, I love Amy and Rory.

I've seen very little of the Fourth and Seventh, but seeing the Fourth and Tenth I can see very similar character traits between the two.

He could easily have saved the lives of everyone but he knew he would be changing history if he did that.

No. No, I do not want any fucking help with my purchase. I am an adult. They allow me to have a driving licence. I can buy my own fucking shampoo. ""Well, if you need me I'll be just over here."" The *instore helper* takes two steps away and pretends to tidy the shelves.

David Tennant was, to me, the worst Doctor ever written. He's a decent enough actor and a good person and I hold no grudge against him. It was merely the writing. Think back on all the really good episodes with him in. He's written as a joker, a vengeful god, a tortured soul, peaceful and mild, bleak and morose. You never knew which end of the spectrum he'd be on any given week. The other Doctors would react to the various situations thrown at them with whatever their predominant theme was, but Tennant's was just wrong. Imagine his reaction had he been in Trial of a Time Lord or Black Orchid or Robot. You probably can't decide on any emotion for him because, at his core, he had none. It all depended on the writer. Should he cry and lash out when it's time to save Wilfred from certain death when he could have easily just laughed it off and jumped in? How about when he ran into Sarah Jane? There was no connection between them. It's no wonder they never brought the Brig back for him. Tennant would have been terrible for it. We'd all pat ourselves on the back and have a good laugh remembering the crazy adventures the old Doctors and the Brig had, but with Tennant they'd just be bland and unassuming. Like watching Mawdryn Undead. You'd tell yourself it was good, but you'd know at your core that you were cheating yourself. 

Unimaginable depth of character and all that could be said is that he was like a five year old with an uzi. He will always be the worst Doctor to me.

On this note I have a lighting engineer mate who worked on the Dome when it was being built ( another unsupervised government project )  Everyone was on the take, basically you could order a new sound system or a £5000 [moving head,](http://people.bath.ac.uk/su2bc/infoguides/smc/movinghead/index.shtml)  send it back as faulty, write it off and then keep it for yourself. One bloke even ordered a bespoke kitchen for his house under the pretence of "" Staff catering"" and had the damn thing installed. People were walking off with whatever they could get away with. 


You wonder why the dome went massively over budget... there's your answer. 

This is no different, albeit on a much larger scale.

The reason Seven places so high on my list is just because he was 'my' Doctor, even though he wasn't the first one I saw. But that's when I started dressing like the Doctor for Halloween. :) The first one I saw was either Five or Three. Five was for sure the first one I saw on TV, but I remember being a really little kid and watching a video with my Dad that had Three in it (and playing with loads of tiny little metal Daleks, which I wish I could find now) so maybe it was that. 

Anyway, yeah. The bottom three are at the bottom just because I don't know as much about them.

Another thing I find funny about the USA is you call people Sir, or if female Mam, all the time (I got called Sir in McDonalds!), this is hilarious to me. I get the idea that the american public expect a degree of 'ass kissing' whenever money changes hands.

A really good example of the difference is in fast food outlets.

What it usually means is ""we are in the process of meeting and whilst I feel the need to say something about it there really is nothing to say"".

The whole event takes place in a couple of huge fields just outside of the town centre. One field is used for a medieval fair kind of thing, you can buy anything from the cheap wooden swords, to a full scale authentic suit of armour. 

If anyone shoots longbow and fancies making some unusual arrows, you can get all sorts of equipment to do that as well - bodkins, to the ends you shove a lit coal in and use to set things on fire. Real feathers, even a new bow if you fancy.

A lot of the people of the town will dress up for the occasion, and there is a parade through the town centre, which is always fun to see.

There are a few have a goes, and of course a beer tent.

As to the actual re-enactment, make sure you get there early to beat the crowds - thousands of people will be on site! If you can get a spot near the gate you should be able to see the entire 'army' walk past you onto the field.

This is important because the Doctor, having always been passionate, was given a widely different view. Without this, he could very well have let the Daleks and the Time Lords continue with Rassilon and Davros vying for dominance over all creation. Instead he decided that the universe was more important and should be protected at tremendous costs. 

And that's just what this is about. This is the same reason the sixth Doctor was taken off the air and why the seventh, being a good Doctor, was also the last until the TV movie and then the reboot. He wasn't just saving a few people at the expense of a few Daleks and some bruised egos. It wasn't one kingdom which needed salvation from a decrepit despot.

Do you really think that the writing was worse during Tennant's era than it was during Colin Baker's? Sure, if he had an endless supply of good scripts his performances would probably have been better, but you can't lay every problem of his at the feet of the writers. After all, Christopher Eccleston had pretty much the same writing team that Tennant had but was able to put in a far better performance.

The problem with Tennant was that he was playing emotions, rather than playing a character. If the script called for him to be happy, he'd be happy; if it called for him to be sad, he'd be sad, etc., however he was completely unable to unify these portrayals into a cohesive character the way the better actors to play the role had.

 ------Spearing --- Lucas 
 
 Maxi---------Gerrard-----Suarez

Standard formation.
Kelly and agger combines (statistically and IMO defensively) is sure way to get clean sheet.

Gerrard without the worry of  defending and right behind striker would be formula for assists and goals. Suarez for width and he likes to move towards the goal, having him use his stronger foot would probably be best option. Kuyt would work his ass off and provide defensive cover if needed, but due to his lack of crosses, maxi is probably better option.
Carroll wasn't bought for no reason, he is good and hopefully he will be able to regain and improve his form, with suarez and gerrard, I don't see how any team would focus their attention on carroll and let these 2 slip by.

R.Meireles can't force fit gerrard out. Henderson is unknown (for us at least), and I think spearing shouldn't be underestimated. Skrtel is good, but fit Carragher would dominate any striker, specially with agger and kelly on his sides.

What happened was likely to be highly illegal. I do actually hope that there are some serious jail sentences as opposed to some slaps on wrists because they damn well deserve it.

I'm not surprised if the Guardian is filling pages about it, but my BBC RSS feed only has two mentions of the incident out of 81.

Davies also said that after writing the scene he inserted a line in the ADR recording for ""Gridlock"" in which the Face of Boe calls the Doctor ""old friend"".[1] However, Davies doesn't like making the relationship explicit, stating ""the moment it became very true or very false, the joke dies"".

[Blue Box](http://www.etsy.com/listing/62783675/blue-box-t-shirt)  This is a cool one because he customized the size for me and everything.  I got a tote with the same image.  He does other Who icons as well (Cyberman, Are you my mummy, etc)

My favorite is actually one from T-Shirt Bordello that's no longer available, just another TARDIS line art, this one sort of off center and swirling.  [This one](http://teecraze.com/tardis-t-shirt/)

true,stordoff,smith,Smith,"I've only really seen new Who so far. Started with a few Tennant episodes, but the first series I watched properly was series 5 (Smith). 

Ranking:

1. Matt Smith - I love the way he plays the Doctor, and the writing for him has been the most consistent.
2. David Tennant - Great actor and definitely on the same level as Smith in that respect, but I felt that his character traits varied too much between episodes/writers. (The fandom surrounding him annoys me a little as well, but it's not fair to judge him on this)
3. Christopher Eccleston - Still a good Doctor, but a step below the other two. Bit of a shaky start, but a good renewal of Doctor Who overall.",0,1309910464,null,0,false,0,c23tsb4,t3_igybl,t1_c23tsb4,t3_igybl,1427318181,1,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,1

The BBC are supposed to be neutral in storytelling, report the news without bias, this does necessarily not mean they need conflicting points of view on every story as you seem to be suggesting

What they should do is take the allegations, the size of the outlet responsible and dedicate an appropriate time towards it, if they reported allegations against NOtW the same as they did against The Guardian then that would be fair and balanced. As I said in my post before they focus far more negative publicity on Murdoch properties than they would about other media outlets because BBC staff are from liberal, Guardian reading backgrounds with strong negative feelings about News Corp.
