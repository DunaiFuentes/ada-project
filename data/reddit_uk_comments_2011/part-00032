http://www.reddit.com/r/doctorwho/comments/hr0bl/pondering_the_tardis_and_alien_languages/


But for my opinion on the matter, here's a slightly revised/updated version of an old response of mine:

I think he's speaking in English most of the time if not all of the time. In Planet of the Dead, the TARDIS is not present (it doesn't translate the Tritovores' language) and everyone understands the Doctor. Also, at the beginning of The Christmas Invasion, the TARDIS' translation isn't working because the Doctor is recovering from the regeneration, and everyone understands him when he speaks during the killer-Christmas-tree scene.

Arguably, it might not have been working during The Eleventh Hour because of similar circumstances (the episode shows that the Atraxi were translating their message into lots of Earth languages) but I'm not sure about that one.

He also mentions (maybe in Planet of the Dead) that he can speak every language but I think once or twice he's been confused (such as with the text on the space station in The Impossible Planet/The Satan Pit). In The Pandorica Opens, he notes that the TARDIS can translate anything.

And don't forget that in the TV movie, despite it being set in America, he still speaks with a British accent. That implies to me that he is actually speaking with said accent, otherwise maybe the TARDIS would have translated it to an American one (?) This also may apply to Day of the Moon/Impossible Astronaut.

That was always the key with Eccleston and Tennant for me, even when they're at their best, you can still see some of that darkness smouldering down in their eyes, I just didn't get the same feeling with Smith a lot during the 5th series.

true,FDrico,null,null,"I don't think the Caribbean islands can be compared with the Malvinas situation. Most of the Caribbean Islands have no issues related to sovereignty, as Malvinas does. So, they have their own waters, and they DO have the right to search of oil and so. But Malvinas is a disputed territory, and many rights are not there to be used without the consent of the counterpart.

Both governments are looking for oil near their coasts, but again, Argentina is not a disputed territory, while Malvinas is (even when the british government and the falklands goverment denies it, or even porpousely ignores it), and in those cases, the search and use of non-renewable resources should not be allowed, or at least should be controlled by both parts of the conflict (right now there is no war, and there is no chance we would go to war again, so this kind of problems can be cooperatively solved).

On the other hand, and i hope you agree with me, even if Malvinas were not a disputed territory, their government would still need to check with the government of Argentina a change in the sovereignty of the territory near the islands, cause it affects the Argentinian territorial waters. So would need to do any caribbean country with another islands or with the continental governments in a similar situation.

The self-determination is applied when it's ok for the world-leader countries only? I won't bring up latest wars on Middle East, but i will say the people who were ocupying the territory when GB invaded the Islands also had such right (not in the papers, of course), but were never applied. A territory does not stop beeing part of a country, even when the territory is fully occupied by people from another country (unless, you know, there are political issues and so).

I call the islads a colony, because that's what it is, and that's how it's categorized by the [Special Committee on Decolonization](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_Committee_on_Decolonization), as you can see [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UN_list_of_non-self-governing_territories#Current_entries).

We cannot fully affirm or deny if the respect for the islanders rights. I hope they would be respected, of course, they should be able, in any case, to stay where they are and have a normal life. The Natives issue is something completely unrelated to what we are discussing. There is a historical problem there which i'm not willing to bring up right now (hope you don't mind, but it's for another conversation).

And, about ""every argentinian"".. of couse not EVERY, depends on the social group you move in. But it is quite a patriotic act for most of them. But it seems that you're just naming the worst caracteristics of the Malvinas, when it's not what we are discussing. I mean, of course we're not talking about Hawaii, but economically they can be quite important (in case they find oil), and strategically they ARE important. I don't care if they're cold and windy and wet. They were, in the past, part of the vast territory of my country. They are perfect to illustrate the mistakes of the Military Junta and the uneffectiveness of the war. They are the cause of many political definitions (Thatcher in Britain, end of the Military Junta here, the anti-war movement against the possible war with Chile a few years later, and the actual government), and i see in them more than just a rock in the middle of the Atlantic.

[The Smoking Room](http://www.bbc.co.uk/comedy/smokingroom/) is probably my favourite work based sitcom in recent years. I can't recomend it enough. Being set in a single room, it has an almost theatre/stage like quality to it, so it relies heavily on the performance of the cast, who luckily are all fantastic. 


I also enjoyed the C4 work based comedy PhoneShop, although I don't see it getting a lot of love online, but it's worth a watch for sure. (Ricky Gervais was involved as a script editor, if that sells it to anyone.)

It was originally part of C4 comedy pilot vehicle 'Comedy Showcase', which also premiered; Campus, Pete v Life, Free Agents, Ladies and Gentlemen (written by Peep Show's Jesse Armstrong and Sam Bain.) and many other hit or miss shows. 

BBC3 do something similar thing called 'Comedy Specials', which are even more hit or miss, but occasionally serves up the odd gem. Although they seem to ignore the things I like, in favour of the tripe that gets passed off as comedy on BBC3, in the wake of ratings success, laughter vacuum, 3 Pints of Lager.  

Another goody that went largely unnoticed was 'Thieves Like Us', a BBC produced comedy based on Danny Kings The Burglar Diaries book. 
It's not amazingly funny, but I remember it being entertaining &amp; well cast.

Other BBC3 shows that are also worth watching imo;  [Him &amp; Her](http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00tmyzz) written by Stefan Golaszewski, who also wrote Cowards, already mentioned in this thread. 
&amp; slacker/awkward/obnoxious comedy [How not to live your life](http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00hwcjg)

http://kaduflyer.deviantart.com/art/Dr-Who-The-Silent-211790224?q=gallery%3Akaduflyer&amp;qo=2

&gt;I grew up with Dr Who, it's part of my heritage as a British SF and fantasy nerd. If you would have told the little kid, that was me hiding behind the sofa, oh so long ago, that one day I'd be making monsters for Dr Who I'd never have believed you.
But for the past 12 months or so that's exactly what I've been doing. And at times, huddled on freezing cold sets up in Wales where the show is shot, I find it hard to wipe the big grin off my face or suppress the little giggles of joy as I realise just how damn lucky I am to do the job I do!


&gt;The design brief for these was a cross between grey aliens and Edvard Munch's The Scream painting. I absolutely hate grey aliens so there's more Munch here than ET.


&gt;The top photo's are of the sculpt. The middle photo's are of the painted masks. I actually made them quite pinkish as I wanted them to look soft and babyish. The open mouthed version you can see was used to create a digital morph of the creature's mouth's distorting as they used their psychic attack!

Setting aside that it's ""allowed"" because it's an international political body, and they can let whoever they want in (I mean, did NATO have to let the USSR in if it asked), I'd say the opposite is the problem, and that it's letting too many people in.

The EU has worked so amazingly well because it was restricted to a small number of countries, all with strong connections and fairly similar social and political structures and ideals.  This meant it could reasonably readily reach consensus, and you'd rarely have a situation where any state was excessively taking advantage of the collective, or being taken advantage of.

Nowadays, when practically all of Europe (plus Turkey, at this rate) is either a member or seeking membership, it's nigh-impossible to obtain consensus on anything, and states are no longer all on an equal footing.  Policies, especially economic policies, that may work wonderfully in Western Europe don't necessarily work as well in the East.  Just look at the current Greek crisis for an example of what can happen if you try to force strong and weak economies to integrate.  I accept that Greece is a long-time member, but the point remains that no small part of the problem is because Greece's economic situation (and to a lesser extent the rest of the PIGS') was incompatible with the German and Benelux economies when they were all jammed together into the Euro.

The problem with Greece is that they didn't adopt proper economic policies or do enough to stamp out corruption and like... get people to pay tax. Now, I would argue that when they joined they should have been made to sort out their problems BEFORE being allowed (or at least before gaining full membership), instead of ""sure, join now and we'll help you sort stuff out.."" which was the attitude prevalent when Romania joined too.

This way, if all these countries want to join, they can't simply reap a load of benefits without doing their part.

The most of your argument is based on problems that the EU (and the UN) *has*, but these problems are a result of bad management. The idea of the EU is great but it doesn't mean that it's run well or effectively, there's much room for improvement.

When Britain re-established her right to the islands the people living there were encouraged to stay, they only sent Louis Vernet away.

Although...I think there is a way to do a repeat of the Midnight entity without it losing *too much* steam...

What if the Doctor runs across a stranded cargo vessel where one of the crew members seems to have gone mad.  They have him locked up and he's repeating words so the Doctor fears that someone is about to be assimilated by the Midnight entity.  The crew members are unhelpful and suspicious, throwing him in their brig before begrudgingly allowing him to investigate the repeater (but not the rest of the ship).  He keeps on demanding how the thing got on board since Midnight is now embargoed and they shrug and guess that someone lied to them about their cargo.

Most of the story, though, is done in pantomime out of fear that too much speaking will let the entity possess someone--maybe even the Doctor again.

Then the possessed crew member dies, completely drained of energy.  The Doctor realizes that the assimilation has already happened.  The Midnight entity is walking around perfectly functionally in one of the other crew members.

It turns out that the people are pirates and had been harvesting the extonic diamonds for the inorganic black market and that's when the entity got aboard.  The Doctor still has to work almost entirely silently in fear that the entity will decide to go after him instead (which is entirely reasonable).

Getting rid of the thing is tricky, though.  He can't just blast the thing into space: Midnight had no atmosphere so the vacuum won't kill it, it would just float around in the void waiting to assimilate something else (even if it would kill the *host*).  He could blow the ship up, but that wouldn't necessarily kill it (since it can survive extonic radiation and all) and then the pirates still aren't willing to help him.

You confuse sentences ( never a good sign - maybe deliberate but still not looking like what others would describe as bright ) transposing one concept to another clumsily. No intellectual link at all. Though this is consistent. The next words accept a statement that the good lady was wise but confuse it with your blinding brilliance  culminating into a wishy washy thought that follows. In psychology that's projection. These words are like saying you did not want to fall into that burning ditch did you. You really should have known the future.

So what you want to pass off as sarcasm ( and you really need to attend comedy school ), were merely crass misplaced thoughts trying to associate yourself with someone who actually did have something to say with some backing, whilst simultaneously making an ad hominem. All with the wisdom of someone who mumbles fire is dangerous.

That *money paid* is currently paid as maintenance. The fee will be deducted from that.

At some point, the Doctor becomes the Valeyard. We've seen flashes of him in ""The Waters of Mars"" and in ""Amy's Choice"". There's an inflection point coming up, when a Time Lord goes insane and the people of the 51st century raise an army against him; when he baits himself into a trap and attempts to kill his past selves; when he strands himself on Earth between 1811 and 2011 hoping to muck up his own time line endlessly crossing and recrossing this period. A Time Lord so deranged and insane that all the most powerful enemies combine forces to trap him in a fairy tale buried beneath the surface of the Earth.  And ultimately he succeeds, succeeds brilliantly by destroying the TARDIS and himself and all of existence, only to have his past self thwart him without realising it.

River Song is a weapon aimed at him; to damn him or redeem him, it's all the same to the Valeyard. They needs must destroy him before he destroys himself. The Master is gone now, there is no balance left to force his good to the surface; perforce he finally accomplishes that which the Master once sought at Logopolis.

true,FDrico,null,null,"What you call ""cooperatively-solve the problem"" was basically the privatization and direct negociation company--british government, and not between governments. The argentinian oil politics were extremely flawed before the Kirchners (i'm not kirchnerist, i'm just naming the facts).

On the other hand, the unilateral decisions made by GB are not something new: in 1991 autorized a law voted for the government of Malvinas, in which is stated the position about the oil-production: don't give a shit about what argentina had to say. In 1995 british and argentinian government signed an agreement of cooperation, but just a month later the Malvinas government opened a licitation to look for oil in its coasts, without the permission (not even a previuos notification) of the Argentinian Government. In 2000, the Malvinas Governament declared the Offshore Petroleum (Licensing) Regulations 2000, and in that year it gave permissions to look for oil all around Malvinas (even in the Argentine sea), again, without checking with the GoA first. When Kirchner assumed as President, relationships changed, and the always ""be calm and be scared of them"" politic around this issue changed completely.

The Malvinas were first claimed by Spain, and when the declaration of Independence was signed, all the territories belonging to the Spanish Crown became to be part of the new nation. Say: Patagonia, Malvinas, Northern populations and the center of the country. Besides, as we discussed before, there where people in the islands when britain invaded them. The Patagonia has nothing to do with it, and neither does the aborigens: there were absolutely NOBODY in the islands when the first commission arrived. They were absolutely desert. So, again, it's not about the originiary people, it's about who occupied them first, and who, 10 years later, decided to invade them. The actions of Luis Vernet are not important, because he was in representation of the Argentinian Government. Whatever he decided to do after the invasion does not correspond to anything we are arguing here. You could even say he didn't like Argentina, because he was in debt with the government (main cause for which he was sent to the islands). It's not something related just to one person: It's about the whole country.

I think we agree that, historically, they belong to Argentina. Socially, they belong to themselves. Certainly, they do not belong to GB. But even if they did, dialoge is needed. Unilateral desitions are not helpful.

Edit: Minor historical mistake. I'm sorry.

Historically they could belong to the Dutch, French British or Spanish.

Malvinas Government has decided, over and over again, to disrespect the agreements signed with the GoA. It's like they don't care about beeing some sort of ""good neighbour"". We can assume there is a portion of territory that's in dispute. But when one of the parts decides to modify even the portions that are not even in dispute, we have a little issue.

But, going back to history, yeah, that's pretty much what i read. And you're right, of course (or.. well.. at least, our sources agree). But here comes again the problem (and i'm sorry to bring it up over and over again, but it's important): they were taken. Britains blew up many things and then decided to get there and, after killing some people (even another man sent to Malvinas by the Buenos Aires Government), raised their flag. Right.

So, we agree pretty much. As i said in my first comment, i'd like them to be a completely self-governed country. Strategically, i don't like them to be part of GB, but i would certainly agree on them beeing independent. Geographically and historically (taken from argentinean hands. Again, they were deserted when the first argentinians arrived there, in 1820, and there was an argetinean settlement when britain invaded them, killed some people and destroyed some constructions), they should belong to argentina. Socially, even politically, they should independent. Finally, i think (after this nutritious conversation) they should be completely independent. But there can't be a good discussion between governments if there isn't any sign of confidence and respect.

I'm fairly certain this started when they first opened the vortex...which also apparently didn't exist until they opened it.  So Gallifrey was 'attached' to it in some way.  

Think of Gallifrey as the home base for all time travel.  While you jump into the vortex to travel about in time, once you go back to Gallifrey, time has been passing no matter how far back or forward in time you go while in the vortex.  You ALWAYS return to that separate time line.

The point of this odd comment is that I don't think you can travel back to Gallifrey's past (even before the timelock).  Every time you visit Gallifrey, its local time has advanced.  

Many would argue, ""Well then why don't you see any advancements or things like that?""

But, turns out the singularity isn't some ever-increasing exponential series, and the Time Lords stagnate for a time — long enough, even, for the Time Lords to forget where they came from, their evolution from humans lost to the time before myths of the great Time Lord society's founders, Rassilon and Omega and (but time eats away at that, too) until the Time Lords themselves are but a memory, waiting for the time they are born again.

There's parallels between the eternal conflict between the Time Lords and the Daleks and The Doctor and The Master, or Davros. Their timelines are for the most part in sync, except where they are intentionally trying to get a step ahead of the other. Then there's The Doctor's romance with River, timelines passing roughly in reverse; that may be a microcosm of the relationship between the two races.

It also has a great meta-fiction aspect to it, since without humans, there really would be no Time Lords.

According to wiki these 3 facts need to be true for constructive manslaughter:

&gt;&gt;There are three requirements for constructive manslaughter:
The defendant must do an unlawful act. This must be a criminal, not civil, offence[13] and must involve mens rea of intention or recklessness. Crimes involving negligence or omission will not suffice.[14]

&gt;&gt;The act must be dangerous. Whether the act is dangerous is objectively judged from the point of view of a sober and reasonable person present at the scene who witnessed the act.[15] The defendant need not be aware the act is dangerous[16] and the act need not be directed at the victim.[17]

&gt;&gt;The act must cause the death of the victim.

Point 1 might be arguable, he was on duty.
'Criminal', I don't know but I have certainly seen police acting worse and not being prosecuted. I think so.

Point 2,  well his push was definitely over the top, and did lead to his death, so yes I would think dangerous, especially as the victim had his hands in his pockets so had no way to stop his fall.

Point 3, I doubt would be contested.

So really might just boil down to the force police are allowed to use at a given moment. 

I think the force he used was criminal, it was not a jostle, the police were not under attack at the time, and he was walking away from them.

Similarly, there are scenes of emotional drama (Obi-Wan's master dies and he gets revenge) juxtaposed with juvenile comic relief (Jar Jar blunders his way through killing droids).

Anyway, you were right, it's quite clearer to me now. Americans blew it up, and the anarchy grew up after that.

We talked about the rights. Different situations: A desert territory in hands of the britains / a territory with around 30 people in hands of Argentina. The islands were in argentinian hands for almost 10 years before british decided to attack and ""take them back""(same right to re-take tham as spain had, sure: almost none, cause they were populated).

Right, it would be the smallest nation in the world (Vatican is something different to what i'd like Malvinas to be), but as you said before, they are almost (and i disagree) independent. They have their own government, their own laws, their own people. If they were a country, i'm sure argentina would respect them. Why? Cause it wouldn't be in british hands, it wouldn't be a colony. It would be a country, with limits well defined. We alredy talked about this: the problem is not the oil itself, it's where it's taken from and the geo-political situation of the territory. If Malvinas were not a disputed territory, Argentina would not have any case against the oil extraction (maybe some ambiental issues would come up, but sovereignty ones.. it if they did, me and many other argentinians would be against our government).

I'm not the Argentinian government, i don't actually what would happen if they were an absolutely independent territory. Forget about a war and a re-take. We don't have the fire power to defeat anybody, not even a country of 4000 inhabitants, and the people here wouln't allow it.

Myself and a few other Brightonian friends game a fair amount. [Rasta-Gaming](http://www.rasta-gaming.com/), an organisation that they founded a handful of years ago, has grown into a larger community with competitive gaming teams joining us from many European countries.

A lot of us attend LANs that are held around the country, we usually have a group of around 40+.  The next hotly anticipated event for us is probably [Multiplay's Insomnia43 Gaming Festival](http://iseries.multiplay.co.uk/).

Its being held in a new venue this year that can hold roughly 3000 attendies, people play xbox, pc, some ps3 possibly (I can't remember). It always turns out to be an awesome long weekend of drinking beers, playing video games, relaxing out in the camping area (some people can use the indoor space if they choose, but it usually reaks hard of sweaty nerd.) &amp; entering fun competitions for freebies. playing with the latest games &amp; tech on the exhibition floor is a bonus for me, as I'm into all that too.

They have a Teamspeak 3 server that everybody uses to voice chat. I cant really do much at the moment as my monitor has died &amp; I've been dealing with RepairTech for 4 months now, trying to get it sorted.

Let me know if there are any pc gamers out there. I am mainly playing League of Legends as that is all time allows, but, I have a fairly decent steam collection going on. :) Most of the Rasta-Gaming teams are CS:S players, but I rarely play it any more.

But what you saw in 'Father's Day' is the more valid form of time travel, as time isn't a 'big ball of stuff', but is more like a river. Now some parts, such as him not going back to Madame, is simply because he can't meet himself through his own timeline, unless it's with Time Lord intervention, or without risking some huge disaster, like in 'Time Crash'. (This happened a few times in Classic, Five Doctors is a great serial) When Rose and Nine dissapeared, it's because the timeline had changed, since Rose had affected the past. Now normally, this isn't possible according to theoretical physicians, but whatevs, it's a show.

He faced it down, and saw his own *very real, very final* death [I don't believe even the Doctor could have survived that radiation level, constantly]. If it wasn't for the attendant, he'd certainly be dead, and very possibly *finally* dead.

All I know is, it's very easy to jump into the show  because the stories really work as sort of mini-movies, unlike today's show, which has storylines that run across several seasons. There are still recurring characters and storylines, of course, but if you were to watch, for example, Pyramids of Mars first, you wouldn't be completely lost.

Part of what makes the greatest episodes the greatest, though, is familiarity with all that has come before them, which is why I'm slowly plugging my way through the whole history of the show. I just finished The Five Doctors today, which means that I'm *waaaaay* into my watching.

true,smileyman,smith,Smith,"Stream of consciousness review:

I'm amused that Barbara the history teacher immediately starts mucking about with the artifacts on the dead Aztec and putting on the jewelry. Must not have learned any archaelogy technique when she went to school. 

3 minutes into it and I already hate Susan.

Amazing costumes (other than the wizard hats). Wish this was in color. 

The high priest of sacrifice guy looks too much like Inigo Montoya. I keep expecting him to break out ""You keeled my father. Prepare to die!""

Loved Ian's bird helmet.

Barbara has a pretty poor understanding of history for a history teacher if she thinks that the destruction of the Aztecs by Cortez had anything at all to do with human sacrifice.

From the very beginning this show was pretty dark. So much for the so-called ""kids"" show.

I love that the Doctor's first reaction to Barbara's meddling was that their lives were now in danger. Of course the struggle between changing history and idly standing by is one that every single Doctor has gone through. 

Ian was badass. 

I'm not a healer. I'm a scientist and an engineer and a builder of things. Is this just a line to get building plans or was that originally his focus, and if so when did it change?

The Doctor was a bit of a moron with the whole ""I'll just help some random warrior out""

The moral superiority that Barbara and Susan throw into the faces of the Aztecs gets very grating. 

The Doctor carving a pulley to increase the leverage to open the tomb was very clever. I liked that a lot, because it didn't rely on some super-human intelligence like the new Who has done.

Ian standing guard as an Aztec warrior reminded me of Rory standing guard as a Roman soldier. Pretty damn cool. 

When did the TARDIS become unmanageable in flight? Is that just an invention of the new series?


**Summary:**

I really liked Ian

Hartnell was in fine form here.

Susan was incredibly annoying.

I liked Barbara, but she got to be a bit annoying as well.

I liked the plot of this one. The costumes and set were great. The pacing was slow of course, but that's standard for classic Who. Based on the half dozen or so episodes of Classic Who that I've watched it seems that the prop department has done better with these set pieces than they have with creating believable monsters.

true,lensassaman,null,null,"Hmm. A female Master, though, would both play into the trope that trans people are deranged and evil, as well as deny the script-writers the opportunity to explore the issues of gender identity that a female Doctor would offer them. (I'd certainly like to see more strong female villains go up against The Doctor, though, so I'm with you there.)

The Doctor has had both male and female companions since the very first episode of Doctor Who; I'm not sure what the problem is there. He's not overtly sexual, but it's far from clear that a change in gender would also mean a change in sexual orientation. For some reason, The Doctor seems to prefer to travel with young, easy-on-the-eyes women — it's one of the most consistent traits throughout all his regenerations. I don't see why that would be likely to change just because he might regenerate as female.

The real problems with this possibility are practical real-world problems, rather than in-world. As you mention, the public acceptance of this would be an issue. Mind you, whether the public accepts it or not isn't what matters, since by the time we know the answer to that, it will have been done. It's whether the producers at the BBC are willing to take that risk. I think there's a greater chance of it happening by virtue of it being a BBC production rather than, say, a property of one of the American networks, but I'd glad not to be the producer who would have to make that case to management.

To change your registered address most banks will require at the very least a signed letter, if not a completed and signed version of their own internal form. The signature would be compared against one they already hold for you, this is to ensure that they are covered against any fraud that may take place on the account as a result of the address change.

What company is going to give you an over the phone payday loan? Everyone of those payday loan companies require some solid Photo ID and also a copy of a recent bank statement to set up an account with them which would allow you to access a loan.

Just having a name and address is not enough, sure you may be able to socially engineer access to an account (if you knew which bank it was and had some idea of what their password/security answer was) but I can guarantee that someone dowloading the UK census data would not be able to use it to get access to any money without a shit load of further work and research of their target first.

You would also do well to remember that the personal information on the census is not much different to that which people put on most social media sites, name, DOB, address. All of which could also be obtained by going through your bins for a week or two, checking the electoral roll or hacking any number of e-commerce sites (added bonus of getting passwords which may work on other sites).

true,Shaper_pmp,null,null,"It's a tough one.  I know at least here in the UK mental health professionals differentiate between delusionality (the tendency to believe irrational things) and *insight* (the ability to differentiate between delusions and reality, or to understand and appreciate their own mental processes and those of others.

For example, you could have a guy who believes Santa sends him messages through the television but is aware that that sounds crazy to other people - he would be delusional but would have insight.

FWIW delusionality seems to be a much stronger requirement than insight to be classified as ""mentally ill"" - someone who had perfect insight but constant delusions might be fit to live in the community (rather than a residential ward), but would still be classed as ""mentally ill"".

Equally, someone with no delusions but no insight either might be classed as ""insensitive"" or ""obnoxious"", but wouldn't be considered mentally ill.

The point is that there's exactly as much hard evidence to actively believe Santa's sending his elves after you as there is to actively believe in the Judeo-Christian god - none, but the delusional people *interpret* everything so as to support this delusion.

Hence they're both ""irrational"" beliefs, but one may well get you classified as mentally ill while the other's not only perfectly socially acceptable, but in many ways is *protected in law*.

Similarly, someone who was delusional but had insight (ie, would usually be considered somewhat able to make their own decisions) might know that their family didn't want them to die, but still believe utterly that Santa would kill their entire family if they didn't euthanise themselves.

My point here is not that there's *no* black-and-white line (or even a vague, grey, blurry guideline) here - it's all a soft, subjective issue with no good general principles.

You can argue that someone who's perfectly sane should be able to end their life, and in principle I'd cautiously agree with you... but then you factor in things like undiagnosed or hidden mental illnesses (even depression), what *degree* of mental instability (current or historical) precludes them from being able to make that choice, how there's no reversing death (the way you can reverse or at least ameliorate many other decisions people can make), etc, etc, etc and suddenly it's really hard to know where to draw the line.

As a result I'm generally in favour of the idea of euthanasia, but I'd have *no idea* how to implement it practically and safely in any situation other than a chronically-painful terminal disease with zero chance of remission. :-/",0,1308660615,null,0,true,0,c20zodl,t3_i3pxa,t1_c20zodl,t1_c20sjoe,1427269194,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

I am aware of the fashion for blaming ""the jewes"" for the worlds ills, however its preposterous to crowbar the holocaust into being a catalyst for England's current brow-beaten state.

The stark contrast between the occidental preaching of golden rule liberalism and the actions of the British Empire were already weighing heavily on the nations hearts well before the 1930's.

The chartist and social democratic movements along with the dialectics of Marx and Hegal had provoked many to seek answers to these issues.

The actions of Gandhi and Connolly together with the experiences of WW1 had set the ball rolling and nothing could stop it.

You seek to apportion blame where there is none. We live in Neo-liberal times and while the Celtic nations can claim to be victims of Victoria's empire they can salve their guilt somewhat, England cannot.

The entire scene where she's about to use the Ostahargen Key, but instead she calls the Dalek Crucible because she knows that's what the Doctor would do first.  She talks to the Doctor and tries to barter with the Daleks, and even though the Doctor disapproves she sticks to what she was sent there to do.  

And then this blonde girl next to him says ""Oh she's good."" when Martha asks who that is, she says it's Rose Tyler.  So, there's the woman who's shadow Martha lived under for two entire years, who unknowingly caused Martha so much heartache for so long, who's name used to twist Martha's heart and make her feel invisible.

Martha's reaction?  ""Oh my God, he found you!""  Nothing but happiness and joy for the both of them.  I loved Martha right from the start, but that scene is my favorite and shows exactly why Martha is amazing.   A few minutes later, they save the Earth and Martha is excitedly hugging Rose and tightly, then the Doctor breaks in for the three-way hug, so happy to see them getting along.

I see this as a very excellent move and Roman needs to just let Villas-Boas do his job. He has won the UEFA Cup. I think that Roman needs to realize that the coaching carousel is a very bad ride and doesn't lead to long-term success.


Tactically speaking, I think that what you mentioned also excites me. Malouda, Torres, and Sturridge as a possible starting attacking group makes me drool.

It has never been our history that has made us great. We have a potent history because we were looking forward at the time. We are less relevant now because we are looking backwards.

true,ghostridethewhip,null,null,"I couldn't agree more. Essien is an engine in the midfield, and more importantly, he's a really solid defensive player. We just don't have any other players that can play as well as he can at either CM (Ramires may get there, but isn't there yet) or CDM (Mikel is too inconsistent). Modric is a quality player, but he is not a CM. We have tried playing players out of their natural positions for years and it just has not worked (see: Torres/Drogba in a 4-4-2).

Sure, Essien may not be the same player that he was two or three years ago. But Essien on the pitch gives us a strong, defensive presence that a smaller, quicker player like Modric or Ramires just will not provide.

And very importantly, with AVB likely to be announced as manager in the next few days, his tactics are already more attacking-based than defensive. If AVB comes into the Premier League guns-a-blazing, he is going to get burned because (I think we can all agree) Premier League squads are much more of a threat both attacking and defending than Portuguese league teams.

&gt;
&gt; I've heard that some people (although with all that twittering perhaps we should call them sparrows) have been giving you a hard time over the ""PULL TO OPEN"" &gt; issue.
&gt;
&gt; When you think about what a *real* Police Box was used for, it's quite obvious that the doors needed to open outward. *Obvious*. Anyone who say otherwise has never used a tiny toilet cubicle where the door opens inward and you have to climb up on the bowl in order to open the door to let yourself out:-)
&gt;
&gt; That said, I've always taken the ""PULL TO OPEN"" to refer to the little hatch containing the phone (which we saw the Doctor do in ""The Empty Child"" when the phone rang), rather than the whole door. After all, the public wouldn't have been trusted with unfettered access to the contents of the Police Box (they might steal the copper/bobby/peeler's lunch!), but they would have needed access to the phone to access the ""ADVICE AND ASSISTANCE AVAILABLE IMMEDIATELY"" promised on the notice.
&gt;
&gt; Would you like to briefly speak (type?) about the issue, and have your final word on the subject, in your blog, so that the non-sparrows amongst us know what's going on?

&gt; Steve

&gt; ""Pull to Open"" obviously refers to the phone hatch, yes. But Idris was right: It IS an instruction, and Police Box doors did open outwards.

[inside a police box](http://www.policeboxes.com/images/interior-c.jpg)

&gt; Placing police boxes on the street effectively provided each constable with a mini police station, and it was later found that beat constables did not actually have to make any physical contact with a police station proper. One consequence of this was that some police stations were closed, thereby providing a cost saving.
&gt; They were four feet square, and contained a small desk, a stool, electric lighting and a heater. A small compartment containing a telephone and first aid kit was accessible from the outside, and these were designed with public use in mind.

If the Neil Gaiman quote doesn't matter then maybe
&gt; However, the dimensions and colour of the TARDIS used in the series has changed many times and none of the BBC props has, in fact, been a faithful replica of the original MacKenzie Trench model.

From all the information I find:

* The sign is for the phone
* The police box doors do open outwards
* People make too big of a deal over the pointless things.

Think about it, a bunch of aliens are invading your home town. Rather then killing everyone they see (like the Daleks) they are taking your friends and family and turning them into more Cybermen. So now what is left of your family and friends are hunting you, trying to turn you into something that they believe is ""perfect"".

A Time Lord so deranged and insane that all his most powerful enemies combine forces to trap him in a fairy tale buried beneath the surface of the Earth. And ultimately he succeeds, succeeds brilliantly by destroying the TARDIS and himself and all of existence, only to have his past self thwart him without realising it.

River Song is a weapon aimed at him; to damn him or redeem him, it's all the same to the Valeyard. They needs must destroy him before he destroys himself. The Master is gone now, there is no balance left to force his good to the surface; perforce he finally accomplishes that which the Master once sought at Logopolis.

I am the Doctor, and **you will obey me**.

Here are the basic facts though; Villa-Boas is very young for a professional football manager (33 the same age as Lampard and Drogba), he has been employed by the bridge before under Jose Mourinho as part of his OOD team, his job was to produce very highly detailed reports on the opposition.

He left to go and manage in Portugal at Academica turned them from relegation certainties to just below mid. he was then poached by Porto where last season he won the Uefa cup, the Portuguese League and their domestic cup.

This summer he was linked with Inter before Chelsea showed their cards and made him the youngest and most expensive premiership manager (£13mil release clause from his contract with porto, same wages as Mourinho).

I wouldn't be very surprised to see that we sign Hiddink very soon to be a Director of Football above Villa-Boas, he is used to this style of running a club and it is something that Abramovich likes as well, he also trusts Hiddink with the club as Abramovich is not going to be around this season as much as he has been.

A line like ""return home"" or ""bugger off"" or something like that might wrap up the speech better from a dramatic viewpoint, but it's less effective from the Doctor's viewpoint. And from the writer's and director's perspective, it sort of presents this image of the Daleks and Cybermen and whoever else looking at each other nervously and stepping back a little, maybe even bickering about who should go first. It also created a very smooth transition into the next bit, and was very 11ish.

Smith: The Beast Below

The Eleventh Hour is too much prologue. You don't need to know who the Doctor or Amy is, and BB suggests that the Doctor's morality is imperfect, but still strong and important. 

Tennant: The Shakespeare Code

A great historical, which any proper DW fan must appreciate. Also features bang-up acting, a great introduction to the 10th doctor, and wonderful examples of Martha awesome.

While it's not my suggestion, I started with Doctor Who's new continuity at ""Human Nature/Family of Blood."" I had already seen Scream of the Shalka, though, so I understood who the Doctor was, and thus who he was not. 

If you can go with two parters, go with Silence in the Library/Forest of the Dead. It's terrifying, but it's much easier to understand than Blink, and it's got great character moments. 

Eccleston: The Empty Child 

I would say to start with Rose... but Rose is really boring if you get the Doctor at all. The Empty Child, however, is the first part of the best Eccleston arc that doesn't involve Daleks. Best of all, it ends in a cliffhanger that will make her want more.

If these were to be taken on by BPP to ""increase shareholder value"" then it is possible that universities would find themselves in a worse financial situation than before.

I would love to see some of Porto's attacking chemistry come to The Bridge with Falcao and Hulk up front (Hulk on the right and Falcao center like they currently do, though I still want Lukaku and do think we would have too many forwards even if we got rid of Kalou and Anelka) and maybe Guarin and/or Moutinho coming in the midfield. I definitely think we would really go after Modrić. I don't know if Roman would have the patience for the likes of Sergio Aguero, Javier Pastore, and Wesley Sneijder to settle but if we were to get an attacking midfielder any of those options would be great and I would add Marek Hamšík to the list.  It has always been my dream to see Eto'o and Drogba on the same team with them switching between the left and center up front but I fear that that dream has past. Having the pace of Elia up front on the left would be a nice option. For right back I would want Van De Wiel. Boy transfer season is better than Christmas.

Play a 4-3-3 once again and have Cole, Terry, Alex and Ivanovic in the back four. We're going to be playing some new people and having a stable defense is crucial, so Luiz should see time at right back and centre back, to ease him into the side. I think we threw him off the deep-end a little bit and he started to drown against United. Give him time to grow, maybe right back will encourage his attacking skills while allowing him to gain more experience defending. I don't see Terry being dropped and playing Terry/Luiz is playing two attacking defenders, not a good mix. Bosingwa is too injury prone so he needs to go but Ferreira is dependable and a good fringe player, so why not keep him around. If Ivanovic/Luiz are splitting time at RB, I don't think we need another one (ie no van der Wiel).

Midfield should be Lampard, Essien, Mikel. Make or break year for Mikel I think, needs to show he can be a main-stay at the holding midfield position. He has improved every year but he's pretty inconsistent. Someone like Rodwell could light a fire under him, provide some competition. I think Lamps and Ess still have more to give so it's a big year for them both too. Modric and Ramires will do well to deputize for them. Send de Bruyne away on loan.

Up front, play Torres (ugh) in the middle, with Sturridge and Aguero on his wings. Lukaku and Drogba can share time up front too, maybe bring in Hulk as well. Lukaku shouldn't get too much time but I would only loan him to an English team so he maintains his 'homegrown' status.",0,1308751247,null,0,true,0,c217okb,t3_i627s,t1_c217okb,t3_i627s,1427273029,3,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,3

&gt;

&gt;1. 
""Things failed to improve under Jol’s successor at White Hart Lane and it was only after the arrival of Harry Redknapp – and departure of Commolli – that Modric, Bale and Tottenham found their stride.""
&gt;

Wouldn't both of these issues - players failing to fit in to the system and players suddenly finding their ""stride"" - be the result of actions taken by the manager? We don't need to look any further than our last season to see the difference a manager can make with the same (basically) squad of players.

Russia is even better, you get your own concierge in Russia and everything you ask for you get at any time of the day. And I mean *everything;* food, drink, drugs, hospitality... the lot.

4- I figure they were trying to get hold of [her baby](/spoiler), or possibly just analyze it- except, of course, they couldn't, because [the real Amy was already being held at Demons Run 3000-odd years in the future](/spoiler).  The little girl[/young River?](/spoiler) had already gotten away from them at this point, hadn't she?  They may have been trying to replace her [(with an earlier version of herself, but they might not know that)](/spoiler).  As for why they needed the girl in the first place, I dunno.  Maybe a pilot for the pseudo-tardis-thing we saw in the Lodger and Day of the Moon?

5- I suspect he didn't want Rory and Amy along for the investigation.  It seems like the Doctor's been trying to keep them (and possibly River) out of the loop a lot this season- he also planned to drop them off before checking out the Flesh, remember.

true,[deleted],null,null,"The one thing that intrigues me about all this discussion is the nomination of some older actors.  It's made me think a lot about the Doctor and some of the things River song pointed out in the last episode.

I haven't watched the old series, so I might be a little off here, but it does seem like the Matt Smith incarnation of the Doctor seems to be the most combative and intimidating version of the Doctor so far. Ten had his moments of rage, and even started with a sword fight, but Eleven is so boldly intimidating right off the bat - ""Basically, run"" and the Pandorica speech being two blatant challenges to his enemies that I don't think any of the other incarnations could have pulled off.

Now, to my point, River Song just pointed out that (spoilers, if you haven't seen the last episode: [his enemies are creating a weapon in the form of her to combat him. ""The Doctor"" is no longer a peaceful term in some cultures. He truly is a warrior](/spoiler)

Anyway, my ultimate point here is that I'd be interested in the Doctor taking on an older, less intimidating persona. I know a lot of people like the idea of Sir Patrick Stewart so I hate to use this analogy, but the Picard to Star Treks original series Kirk. Intimidating if necessary, and capable of holding his own in a fight ... but overall, someone that's less brawn/intimidation. Obviously it's hard to convey in words in the context of the Doctor because he's so intellectual, but I hope my thought makes sense.

I have enjoyed each of the three ""new"" doctors equally, though - they each bring a lot to the table and problems with their companion interactions aside, they have been very interesting to watch and to start to rewatch as you get to know them a little better each time.

Comolli's record with bringing in fresh talent is probably the best in England. Is Jol suggesting that anything other than a 100% purchase success record is not acceptible? 

Comolli's role was to scout out players and to fill the ranks with cheap development potential. Jol took over from there in terms of team selection. According to all the sources I have read, Comolli had a ~50% 'success' rate with bringing players in, which is **fantastic** and it means that they have players who are now worth tens of millions of pounds (Modric, Bale) who were bought in only a few years ago at a fraction of that price

true,paolog,null,null,"Some notes and corrections for any non-Brits wanting to use these:

&gt; Wanker - Idiot

No - that should be ""Wanker - Asshole"". ""Wanker"" is *much* stronger than plain old ""idiot"".

&gt; Bee's knees

Don't forget the apostrophe.

&gt; Know your onions - knowledgeable

This is a verb phrase, not an adjectival phrase (fairly obviously)

&gt; Punter - Customer/Prostitute’s Client

Despite the sense of ""john"" (prostitute's client), this can safely be used to mean ""customer"" without fear of being misunderstood. It also means ""someone who places a bet"".

&gt; Quid - £

Same in the plural and singular - ""one quid"", ""five quid"".

&gt; Pissed - Drunk

and

&gt; Dog’s Bollocks – Awesome

Not in polite use, but safe to use in informal contexts. Note that it's ""**the** dog's bollocks"", as in ""I've just bought the latest iGadget - it's the dog's bollocks!""

&gt; Chap – Friend/Mate

Totally wrong. ""Chap"" = ""guy"" of the male variety only. For a mixed group, you can humorously say ""chaps and chapesses"".

&gt; Bugger – Jerk

Not in polite use, but OK in informal situations. Also in various verb formations: bugger off = piss off; bugger about/around = mess around; buggered = broken beyond repair; in the shit; bugger all = jack shit (nothing).

&gt; Bog Roll – Toilet Paper

Not in polite use. Also ""bog"" = toilet. Polite equivalent: loo.

&gt; Pants – Panties

""Pants"" can refer to either men's or women's underwear.

&gt; Absobloodylootely – YES!

Not in polite use.

&gt; One Off – One time only

Not quite: it's a noun, as in ""it's a one-off"" - something that is done once or is a once-in-a-lifetime occurrence.

&gt; Arse-over-tit – Fall over

This is an adverb, not a verb, so ""to fall/go arse over tit"" (no hyphens needed).

&gt; Dog’s Dinner – Dressed Nicely

Not an adjective, as the translation would suggest. The phrase is ""done/dressed up like a dog's dinner""

&gt; Up for it - Willing to have sex

Can also just mean ""willing"", as in ""Fancy coming down the pub for a few jars?"" ""Yeah, I'm up for it."" Can be used in this way without risk of misunderstanding.

&gt; Chat Up – Flirt

Flirt *with*. This is a transitive verb. Example: ""He's been chatting up birds [= women] all night.""

&gt; Fit – Hot

As in sexually attractive, not overheated.

&gt; Strawberry Creams – Breasts

I've never heard of this one. Go for ""tits"" or ""bristols"" (rhyming slang from ""Bristol City"") instead.

&gt; Shag – Screw

Coarse slang. ""Screw"" in the sexual sense only. ""Shagged"" also means ""exhausted"" or ""ruined, done for"".

&gt; Gentleman Sausage – Penis

I'm not familiar with this one, but suspect it should be ""gentleman**'s** sausage"".

&gt; Twigs &amp; Berries – Genitalia

""Twig"" singular, and of the male variety only.

&gt; Fanny – Vagina

Not in polite use, but not all that rude.

&gt; Bollocks – Balls

As in ""testicles"". Not in polite use and fairly crude.

&gt; Don’t Get Your Knickers in a Twist – Get worked up

**Don't** get worked up. Equivalent to American English ""Don't get your panties in a bunch.""

&gt; Bangers – Sausage

Sausage**s**, plural. Commonly in ""bangers and mash"", a dish of sausages and mashed potato.

&gt; Chips – French Fries

And don't forget that what Americans call ""chips"" are called ""crisps"" in the UK.

&gt; Daft Cow – Idiot

Referring to a woman only. Don't use this to a woman's face unless you want yours slapped.

&gt; Do – Party

Despite appearances, this is a noun, not a verb (**a** do, not **to** do). It can refer to any social event.

&gt; Smeg – From Red Dwarf

This is the *origin* of the word (Red Dwarf is a British comedy sci-fi show from the 80s). It's a generic swear word used in the show but it's never really caught on. Best used only with your nerd friends.

&gt; Bits ‘n Bobs – Various things

Miscellanea; the sort of stuff in that drawer you've been meaning to clear out.

&gt; Shambles – bad shape/plan gone wrong

Not quite - it just means a mess, either literally (a confused jumble) or figuratively (a situation that has gone wrong). Originally meant a slaughterhouse.

&gt; Lost the Plot – Idiot

Come on, anglotopia.net, stop getting your parts of speech mixed up! ""He/she has lost the plot"" means ""He/she has gone crazy"" or ""He/she is behaving irrationally or stupidly"".

&gt; Her Majesty’s Pleasure – To be in prison

More part-of-speech confusion here. The phrase is ""to be at Her Majesty's pleasure"".

&gt; Horses for Courses – Won’t work for someone else

""It's horses for courses"" = ""your mileage may vary"".

&gt; Meat and Two Veg – Genitalia

Again, men's only.

&gt; Knob Head – Idiot/Dickhead

Not in polite usage.

&gt; Chav – White trash

Doesn't change in the plural in American English (""He is/they are white trash"") but does in British English ""He is a chav""/""They are chavs"". As derogatory as ""white trash"".

&gt; Chap – Friend

Hm, haven't we had that one before?

&gt; Stag Night – Bachelor Party

For a husband-to-be only. The equivalent party for the bride is a ""hen night"".

&gt; Blighty – Britain

No, it means England.

Personally, I think that the Doctor is going to end up killing a lot of people.  It would be the worst he's ever been.

Then something happens, and he regenerates into someone broken.  I think 9 would have been perfect to play it.  A Doctor who hates himself, hates his history, and just wants to run away.  He can force the funny bits, but everyone knows he's broken, and we spend a bit of personal time with the doctor trying to get over it.

The fact of the matter is that freedoms do have to be restricted for the good of the society. Imagine if there were no regulations for companies to follow, it would be madness and the customer would inevitably lose. What if there were no traffic laws etc etc... society would be a lot worse if people were free to do as they please.

The Government cannot place the rights of the business as above the rights of the public. Both need to be evenly treated, and that would be the sign of good government. This is what we should be aiming for as we can't have everything our own way at the expense of the businesses, otherwise they will simply leave to operate in better conditions. Personally, like many others, I like things the way they are in terms of internet regulation, as it benefits myself. But it's ""different strokes for different folks"", and whilst I win, someone else loses.

""How far is too far?"" is the crux of the issue we'd be facing.

&gt;Allowing the rich to get richer at the expense of our freedom is unthinkable.

Considering all the reports tend to say that this is happening anyway, the rich are still getting richer, whilst the poor are facing cut after cut. Why would this be the breaking point that goes against the trend?

&gt;governmental control like this is draconian and Orwellian

It all depends on the previous ""how far..."" issue. Just as it is the government who deems how fast we can drive, or what age we can start drinking, the government is going to get involved with this. If they only blocked pages with child porn and similar, would that also be lumped in with ""draconian and orwellian""?

Yeah Sasquatch was pretty chilled. It's 3 hours drive East of Seattle right in the middle of nowhere.

We hired a big car and packed it with beer, and it took 10 mins for my friend to find chemical supplies from another festivalgoer once we'd parked up. You camped next to your car in this one, which I was dubious about before setting off but was amazing. Could just loads and loads of crap in the last town before the festival and not have to drag it 2 miles (.....like at Glasto). We even hooked up other cars and tried to play Flaming Lips ""[Zaireeka](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zaireeka)"" on the four stereos simultaneously, with mixed results.

The festival had an arena arrangement, with ridiculous overpriced beers inside. We did most of our drinking on the campsite. In the best booze-smuggling move I've ever seen, Swedish camping companions put unopened plastic bottle caps ([like these](http://imgur.com/xlI9r)) on clear mineral water bottles full of vodka....evaded security.

A society may sometimes find it useful to grant them rights if they think it would be the interests of promoting people's rights, but if either screwing over businesses with restrictive legislation, or leaving them unprotected, and not modifying the law to help them is what best serves the interests of people, then why should the interests of an abstract entity count at all against the interests of actual people?

*People* all need to be treated equally, or have their interests counted equally. That implies something about how the interests of businesses (which consist of people) should be weighed up against the interests of the public, but I think it implies listening to what business's want a good deal less than is currently the case.

After all, this point of view is reflected in our laws in the fact that no business has a vote, nor are there MPs representing businesses (in the way that Oxford University used to have an MP). The design is such that the interests of businesses ought to only count as much as they are the interests of their owners, employees and customers, and reflected in the votes of these people. Unfortunately they use money to mess up this system, and sway governments to their side is with the backdoor influence of donations and directorships for ex-MPs, and the ability to make the lives of people miserable by moving to other countries, etc.

true,ghostridethewhip,null,null,"Sign: Lukaku, Aguero/Hulk, Van der Wiel, and maaayyyybe Modric.

Sell: Bosingwa, Anelka, and Benayoun (if we get Modric).

DEFENSE: We are set on defense. We are at least two deep at every position in defense, and we have plenty of potential CBs (Terry, Luiz, Alex, Ivanovic). I, for one, think that Ivanovic is a great right back. He's been about the only consistent player in the squad over the past year. That said, I desperately want to off Bosingwa. He is an awful RWB that cannot defend, cannot hold possession, and is not that good at attacking either. If we sell him, I say we should sign Van der Wiel. Fererria is not much better than Bosingwa, but I will at least say that he is an OK defender and he wouldn't bring much if sold because of his age anyway.

MIDFIELD: Assuming we play a 4-3-3, our midfield needs to be Lampard/Benayoun/Modric at CAM, Mikel/Ramires/Essien in a defensive midfield position, and someone at the CM position. In my opinion, we should work in McEachran at that CM position. He is just a boy, but he has poise that I just have not seen in a player his age on a stage as big as the Premier League. The most important job for a player in the CM position in this squad is to not lose possession, and to make your passes count. He looked extraordinary on the ball last season, and I don't know the exact numbers, but he looked to be over 85% on pass completions as well. I think it's time to give him a shot, and I'd much rather keep that money in the bank to be used when we actually need it.

ATTACK: I think it is safe to say that the attack will be built around Torres. Drogba is too important to the squad to be released, and if Torres is hurt, he would be a great striker for the club in stretches (so long as he doesn't tire out over the long haul). I think we keep Malouda in at LW as well. He links up very, very well with Ashley Cole, and I don't see the point in ruining one of the most lethal aspects of our attacking game over the past few seasons. My question mark is RW. Anelka is still quality, but he is getting older and I think we should cash in on him while he is still worth something. Kalou is going to be bumped down the roster quite a bit, and to this point he has been ok with being a bit-part player when we need him. He is also Drogba's best friend, and offing one of them would certainly upset the other, and we don't want any more locker room issues than we've already had. I think the best option at RW would be either Sturridge (for much of the same reasons as I alluded to above with McEachran), or a player we sign such as Hulk or Aguero. All three have proven quality, and all three are young enough that they still have room to improve. Sturridge could be the future of this club, and I hope he gets a chance. Lukaku needs to get in soon to learn from Drogba before he leaves the club.

The one thing that people forget about Chelsea is that the squad is getting older, but it is not a bad squad. There is no need for a massive overhaul and a hard restart on the club. It would be smart to work towards long term replacements for Lampard/Drogba/Anelka, but we don't have to just off the whole team and start from scratch immediately. Most importantly, we cannot sell more players than we buy again this summer. Last season, we went in with a small squad, and it cost us the title by the end of the season because of injuries and the inabilities of the young players to fill in.

Edit: Oh yeah, people who say that we should sell Drogba because he is aging and not the player he used to be makes me a bit angry. Shouldn't you have more respect for a player who has been pivotal in turning around the entire football club? If the man wants to stay, you let him stay, if anything out of respect for what he has done for Chelsea.

IMO these stories must be viewed as dramawhorage and link-grabbing antics because the source won't go on record. When one reads/hears interviews from people who work on DW, one major theme emerges: A lifelong ambition to be involved with the franchise. 

Private Eye expects us to believe that chaos reigns on a project so many people care about, but can't get a *single one* of the terrorized insiders, either current or fleeing the alleged carnage, to put their name to the quotes?

true,Robotochan,cnty-england,Ashby-de-la-Zouch,"To say that a business has no rights would imply that a businesses belongings are therefore our own belongings, since they have no right to own anything. Ownership, is a right in it's own.

The point being that in the highlighted case, BSkyB has made a legally binding deal with the producer of a product, ie the Premier League, to be a distributor to their product. Part of the terms and conditions will state (I've not checked, but I'm pretty sure it's in there) that people will not re-distribute content. Since people are breaking that contract, BSkyB has the right to follow up on the breach and take action.

They pay taxes (I assume...) just like everyone else in this country (again, I assume...) Do they not have the right to protect the contracts and the things they have bought? Otherwise, what's stopping us simply taking anything we want from businesses without fear of retribution?

Whilst a business won't have the same rights as the public (such as voting), a business still follows the law and in that they are afforded their own protection and rights.

As for...

&gt;then why should the interests of an abstract entity count at all against the interests of actual people?

I didn't say they should. But if every single person has their own rights which can go above the wishes of everybody else, so can a business.

&gt;I think it implies listening to what business's want a good deal less than is currently the case.

This is more than this one issue really, as it's generally a good idea to try and attract business, and therefore jobs, into a country especially when the economy needs helping. What needs to be done though is to work out a balance between the people and the corporations/businesses that benefits the country. If we treat them harshly in an effort to recover lost income, we risk alienating them to other countries, taking anything they offer with them. We need them and they need us. Unfortunately, there's corruption that muddies the water.

There are things that make it hard to measure, such as off-shore businesses, but a UK business, based in the UK has rights by law.

Pre-Time War the Doctor had a somewhat different impact on his companions. They went to become nurses (Nyssa), explorers (Jo Grant), and, yes, doctors (Harry Sullivan). Or they fell in love (Vicki, Susan, Peri) or went back to their old lives more confidently (Sarah Jane, Tegan, Turlough).

Post-Time War, it seems he has the opposite effect, turning doctors and nurses into warriors (Martha, Rory) or sending them back to their old lives not quite right (Donna, Jack). I think this reflects how much closer to the surface his dark side has become. It makes him dangerous and exciting but it also perches on the edge of madness.

* It happens to be the case that they have rights under current laws
* How would businesses exist otherwise? 
* It's better for all of us if they have certain rights.

These points I understand, and our disagreements would mostly just be on whether in fact it is the case that we're genuinely better off with businesses having certain rights. But sometimes you slip into things like:

&gt; They pay taxes (I assume...) just like everyone else in this country (again, I assume...) Do they not have the right to protect the contracts and the things they have bought?

and

&gt;...if every single person has their own rights which can go above the wishes of everybody else, so can a business.

and (from your previous post)

&gt; Both need to be evenly treated

which make it seem like you think that businesses have rights morally, in the same way that humans do, and that their interests are important in their own right. 

My point is that if some hypothetical legal system that completely ignored the rights of businesses, or even forbade them from existing at all resulted in more *people's* rights being upheld than some other legal system which did admit some rights of businesses, then the former system would be better. Business themselves don't matter at all, not morally!

When trying to work out what the government should do, there's no reason to admit the interests of businesses, except insofar as they are also the interests of people. Remember how arbitrary businesses are. They should only exist and operate in the way they do if it's in everyone's interest that they do so. Other kinds of organizations exist and have existed and been allowed to exist by laws that say what they can do, what rights they are granted and so on: unions, guilds, churches, secret societies, monoplistic cooperation-type things like the East India Company, armies, sectors of the state (eg. healthcare systems, postal services). 

Do all these have rights in the same way that humans have rights? No.
Should the interests or rights of the NHS, say, be balanced against the interests rights of its patients? No.

true,smileyman,smith,Smith,"Here's the list because I despise sites that feel the need to have each item in a list be on a separate page.

10) Sutekh
The destroyer of worlds from Phaester Osiris was easily one of the most powerful enemies the Doctor ever had to face, as witnessed by his torturing and subsequent control of our hero. Gabriel Woolf’s sibilant delivery of Sutekh’s lines played a huge part in making this character so memorable.

9) The Zygons
The bringers of a monster to Loch Ness, these were one of the most stunningly-designed aliens ever in the series - although ironically their shape-changing abilities meant they spent much of their time disguised in human form.

8) The Vashta Nerada
A quite chilling concept from Steven Moffat, these microscopic swarm creatures inhabit the dark. Once they have latched onto you as their pray, there is little hope of escape.

7) The Silurians and Sea Devils
Although misnamed (as they existed long after the Silurian period), another great concept for a monster in the shape of advanced reptilian bipeds that occupied the Earth before Man - whom they tend to see as a verminous interloper who needs putting down. When used at their best, stories featuring these enemies can raise some interesting moral questions.

6) The Ice Warriors
One of the monsters from the original series that were given more thoughtful treatment than most, particularly in The Curse of Peladon when they were actually amongst the good guys (the Doctor was shown to harshly misjudge them). Over multiple stories their character development meant you got a greater sense of them as a species than many of the Doctor’s foes. The monster I’d personally most like to see brought back to the series.

5) The Cybermen
Originally conceived as an exploration of what would happen if cybernetics were applied to a whole body, rather than individual body parts, these are the monsters that have gone through more redesigns than any other in the series. Not perhaps the best-treated though, as they have been given all manner of weaknesses over the years, being affected by radiation, solvents, gravity and gold just for beginners, and also a strange propensity for ludicrously convoluted plots. The shot of them walking down the steps outside St Paul’s Cathedral is still one of the series’ iconic moments nevertheless.

4) The Master
The Moriarty to the Doctor’s Holmes, and originally brought to us with a demonic charm and panache by the late, great Roger Delgado, whose wonderful performance in the role has never been bettered. Another character who was given a strange propensity by scriptwriters, this time for pointless disguises, and also whilst played by Anthony Ainley a capacity to miraculously escape life-ending situations with little explanation. John Simm brought an extra psychotic quality to the role in recent years, with his last appearance resulting in him saving a universe he had done his best to menace on numerous occasions

3) The Weeping Angels
Easily the most terrifying monsters of the series since its return, these time-feeding creatures appear as statues when you look at them, and only move when you don’t. As the Doctor says, don’t even blink! The design of the angels only adds to the menace, and statues have never seemed quite the same since.

2) The Nestene Consciousness
This collective mind’s affinity with plastic has made for a memorable threat, as dolls, telephone cables, chairs and daffodils have all been turned into killers, along with a menacing wheelie bin which trapped Mickey Smith. Most memorable of all are the shop window dummies which come to life and go on a murderous rampage, another of the original series’ moments reused by Russell T Davies to relaunch the series.

1) The Daleks
It can only be. A triumph of design by Raymond P Cusick, who created something that so clearly wasn’t just a man in a monster suit, added to by the distinctive voice realised through a ring modulator in the Radiophonic Workshop, resulting in something that has transcended the programme, and even found its way into the Oxford English Dictionary! There have been arguably few television creations that have had the cultural impact the Daleks have attained. The first monsters the Doctor ever encountered, that meeting helped the fledgling programme achieve lift-off. The Doctor’s most perennial foes, their encounters with the Time Lord have added extra layers to their own story, particularly after their creator Davros made his appearance.

Individually they may be fearsome fighting machines, but the species as a whole seems to be easily defeated by the Doctor. They do have the benefit of being able to survive like cockroaches, but as Craig Ferguson says they're basically a giant espresso machine.

No Silents, the Weeping Angels should #1, the Nestene Consciousness really isn't all that scary. The Ice Men are scarier in the audio dramas by Big Finish than they are in the tv series. The Silurians should not be anywhere near the top 10. 

My list

1. Weeping Angels. They're moving statues that can send you back in time and destroy your future. 

2.) The Master. Proper villain for the Doctor to continuously battle.

3.) Vashta Nerada. They're in every, single shadow. There's a reason we look out of the corner of our eyes in the dark.

4.) Midnight. Feeds on the fear of sentient beings and can take them over. 

5.) Daleks. Individually they're terrifying. As an entire species, not so much.

6.) Cybermen. See the Daleks. The frightening thing about the Cybermen is that if they get ahold of you they'll completely convert you to their way of thinking.

7.) Abzorbaloff. It can absorb living things into it and they retain their consciousness.

8.) Family of Blood. They feast on Time Lord energy and use scarecrows as animated minions. How is that not terrifying?

9.) Silents. They haven't done much yet, but they're creepy, scary, and can wipe your memory and force you to do their bidding.

10.) House. He was able to take over the TARDIS and rip her out of the console. He can force visions on other people (Rory and Amy in the TARDIS).

&gt;It happens to be the case that they have rights under current laws

Partially. It is not coincidental, as that is how a capitalist system works. It isn't a case of public vs business, the two are interconnected. When laws are written, they have to take into account more than public opinion and business interests. It has to be good for the country as a whole. And that means creating law that covers both groups.

&gt;How would businesses exist otherwise?

Business couldn't operate in conditions where the law/rights didn't take them into account. Business can only happen where the seeds have been planted (sound pretentious... I know).

&gt;It's better for all of us if they have certain rights.

Yes, it is. But only as far as it's good for business that we have certain rights, otherwise only a few would be able to afford the benefits of an open market making progress stagnate.

&gt;My point is that if some hypothetical legal system that completely ignored the rights of businesses, or even forbade them from existing at all resulted in more people's rights being upheld than some other legal system which did admit some rights of businesses, then the former system would be better.

That's essentially communism, in which there are no businesses as everything is owned by the people, would be better than the current middle ground we are in would be? The NHS is a socialist system that is  separate from both business and public, as it is a branch of government.

&gt;When trying to work out what the government should do, there's no reason to admit the interests of businesses, except insofar as they are also the interests of people.

Correct, a democratic government is there to represent the people who elected it. But that doesn't negate any rights for business in any way. Business is a massive part of our country, and has to be treated accordingly. And that means that it is afforded similar values/rights as anyone else.

Consider that rights aren't morally given, they are legally given. We are allowed to live without the fear of oppression as happens in Africa/Asia, because of our law, not because of morals.

true,IPoopedMyPants,null,null,"Troughton was an amazing Doctor. As much as we all owe Hartnell a debt of gratitude for starting the character, I think Troughton gave the Doctor a lot of the characteristics we all love. Of course, he is truly at his best at the end.

I've so far met Doctors 1-6 and 9-11. Until this point, I would probably have put the first Doctor as my least favorite, but there really isn't enough of him that survived to make me truly believe that he was the worst. 

However, I have seen Caves of Androzani and The Twin Dilemma today. I genuinely believe that those are respectively the best and worst episodes I've yet seen of Doctor Who.

Davison was such a great Doctor, but in so many subtle ways. I also think he suffered from having less great companions.  Adric annoyed the hell out of me from beginning to end (and his death was neither heroic nor a brave sacrifice), Nyssa... well, she was alright, Teegan never really felt like she was part of it, which blew my mind, considering that she was the longest serving companion, Kamelion didn't even make sense, and Turlough was probably the most interesting as a prick who seemed reluctant to be an occasional good guy. I feel like if Davison had Sarah Jane Smith and Pertwee had Leela, we might not be looking at Tom Baker as everyone's favorite Doctor.

Then again, Tom Baker was pretty damned glorious as the Doctor. 

I do know that I feel less enthusiastic about going through Colin Baker's years than anyone I've come across yet. I hope it's just the result of an atrocious introduction.

And speaking of 5, Turlough was my favorite companion of his because of his moral ambiguity. It made him far more interesting than the others. The thing is, while most people absolutely love the 4th Doctor, to me he's just 'okay'. I don't know what it is about him but he never really clicked with me that well.

true,dragontiers,null,null,"I think part of this is because things are becoming more black and white to the doctor, with less shades of grey.  He had no problem destroying a fleet of Cybermen because to him (I believe) they no longer have any redeemable qualities.  It was proven that if the emotions of the creatures harvested for Cybermen are turned back on, they become horrified at the things they've done and what they've turned into.  He therefore sees it as putting them out of their misery, even though they no longer feel that misery themselves.

This black/white view has caused him problems recently, most notably with the Space Whale.  He could only see two options: free the whale and doom the humans, or lobotomize the whale and turn it into what it seemed, just a vehicle.  It was either save the whale or the humans, no creative solution to do both.  It's times like this he really needs his companions, to show him it doesn't have to be this way.

I think another side of this was shown when he received the invitation from himself.  With everyone in the TARDIS, he became almost like a petulant little child.  He refused to go on the adventure when (I feel) previous incarnations would have jumped at it simply because of the mystery (for example, when 10th went to the Library just because of the message on the psychic paper, with no further info or prompting).  He became angry with River and refused to trust her, despite indications that he would trust her as he does no one else in the future (as indicated by her knowing his name).  He even refused to listen to Amy until she swore to him it was important  and she wasn't being coerced.  I'm sure there have been other examples, but these are ones that stuck with me.

Sell him now, reduce wages, get top transfer funds for him.

You have to remember that a lot of the guys we signed in the past ~3 years came in on very high wages. We didn't have the transfer funds available so we bought players by winning them over with high wages. 

Meireles is likely paid 3-4x more at Liverpool than he was at Porto. Same for Maxi, Joe Cole, Acquilani, etc. Selling all of these guys or loaning them out will not only raise substantial transfer funds, but also greatly reduce the wage bill. 

Our wage bill went from £90M ('09) to £118M ('10), a 31% hike in wages while revenue grew in the single-digits. We spend a lot more in wages for both a smaller squad, a squad of inferior quality and the wage bill still went up even after we sold off some of our star world class players. Consider that the Liverpool wage bill is the same as Arsenal's, and they have both a very deep squad and a lot of top-class talent. 

The difference in the wage bill from between the time Alonso, Mascherano et al were at the club, and now, where we have Maxi, Cole, Meireles, Jovanovic, etc. is £28M. Just consider that for a second - £28M more, for a team that finished 6/7th instead of second and is a much smaller squad. **That should give you an idea of just how high the salaries are for Maxi, Cole, Meireles, Jovanovic, et al.**

We could sell these guys and use the proceeds to fund an entire mid-table club. I wouldn't be surprised if each of these guys is on 80-90k plus appearance and performance. Consider that Kyrgiakos, a 4th choice CB, somehow got himself a 3-year appearance-based renewal contract - and he is 32! no wonder these second-tier players jumped at the chance to come and play at Liverpool.

Wages and contract length are the new transfer fee - ie. the primary figure of contention when considering who to buy and sell. Consider that Cole's contract is worth a minimum of £19M, and Meireles likely similar, and it starts to make sense as to why we are paying £20M for 20 year olds, who likely earn 20-35k a week.

Its seems Chinese schools in China are all allowed to be ethnically Chinese. Indian schools in India are all allowed to be ethnically Indian. Pakistani schools in Pakistan are all allowed to be ethnically Pakistani. The same is true for practically every other ethnically non-White nation on the planet. And that's absolutely fine, all people should have the basic fundamental right to their own societies.

But woe betide anyone who suggests that British schools in Britain should all be ethnically White British (the very fact that I need to qualify the term 'British' with 'White' is an indication of just how successful White-hating multiculturalists have been). No, that would be ""racist"". If you're Black, Brown, Yellow or Purple with Green polka dots and you want to preserve your own ethnicity, culture and heritage that's absolutely fine; that's your right, that's a noble and virtuous thing. But don't for one second entertain any thoughts of wanting to preserve your own ethnicity, culture or heritage if you're White; that's racist, that's xenophobic, that's just plain evil.

So carry on championing the ethnic cleansing of indigenous White Brits, and sneering at us with comments such as ""probably do a whole lot better on their English exams than native English speakers"" - but know this, those of us who choose not to lie down and meekly accept our fate are not the racists. The real racists are those who are trying deny my people their most basic human and civil rights - the right to preserve our freedom, identity, culture, heritage and ultimately our own existence. No, the real racists are people like you.

This slightly misconstrues what they are doing and suggests that all websites have to be pre-approved before they can be seen.

It's actually the other way around. I.e. they will block websites ""whose primary function is the distribution of copyright material"" which isn't quite so scary IMO. They will decide which websites cannot be seen. 

That's not to say i don't think it's absolutely disgusting (i like piracy and wouldn't have half the cultural richness if were not for free films, music and documentaries, book etc which i often pay for if i like!) and will be a complete fucking waste of time, the tech world simply moves far too fast for judges and the legal system. Websites will move domains or change IP at a moments notice, p2p domain name systems will take off and the process will have to start all over again. What a joke.

But the wording on boing is slightly disingenuous.

Modern engines actually reduce the amount of emissions. By running the injectors at higher pressure you get a cleaner burn and thus cleaner emissions out back. Common rail injectors have dramatically boosted efficiency in already efficient engines. You cannot get more energy out unless you are burning more or burning more cleanly. Anything else violates the first law of thermodynamics.

It isn't just a fudge to beat emissions standards. Industries like the excavator industry have been using common rail engines for a long time because they tend to be more efficient.

Although waiting staff might be on the minimum wage, this is about five times higher in the UK than in the US so your waiter/waitress won't starve if you don't leave a tip.

Tipping is pretty much expected at the end of a taxi journey.

The treasury gets back its money (no profit), the public end up holding *vast* amounts of these banks and can sell whenever they like. Imagine how this could change the attitude of banks if the majority ownership was genuinely in the hands of the public?

If the banks did something wrong you'd need only ~10% of the public to gang together and threaten to mass sell their shares together and the banks would be scared shitless- that amount of selling at once would trash their value.

Not to mention that I don't actually think it unreasonable that a large enough majority of the general public think that bonuses are too high, something which the politicians refuse to touch, that the public would be able to force some kind of settlement on the banks.

For example, I could say: ""I think you should be able to physically hit someone in self defence if you fear for your life. Perhaps if they pull a knife on you""

And, you might in turn say: ""Cool, does that mean you can hit someone in the testicles 100 times until they fall off, tie them up for 20 years, turn them over, spit in their anus and insert a rusty knife into it then eat their balls lightly toasted in a bagel with olives and cream cheese"".

You're creating a false dichotomy; suggesting only one of two extremes is possible at any given time. I've never suggested that torture should be legalised as you suggested, and I'm sure you're aware that isn't legal in the States; the example I gave to illustrate my argument, so I'm not entirely sure where you got that from.

Getting 4.5 million people to agree and to act in a timely manner might not be all that easy. 

Most of the new stakeholders would likely be ill-informed and not motivated (due to the small size of the holding) to really understand how the banks work. Have you ever read the annual report from a major bank? It is pretty tough going. 

Will those new stakeholders use their power to make good informed decisions? I would be concerned that they might make decisions on an emotional basis to punish the banks and bankers. This could have a negative effect on what is a key sector of the UK economy.

Alternatively they might just absent themselves, especially if they see the shares as worthless (at or below the floor price).

Adding that to the fact that we have been conditioned to believe that industrialism, capitalism and consumerism are necessary to human happiness despite this being absolutely untrue.

It's also why I started watching classic episodes of Doctor Who. I keep hearing about people's favorite Doctor, favorite episode, favorite companion, and favorite villains, but I couldn't really put any of that into perspective from my own vantage point.

I still have 2 seasons of Baker to watch, then McCoy and McGann. It's a bit depressing to think that I've probably seen all of the best of Doctor Who, but I still have the Rani and Ace to meet up with, so there's a glimmer of hope left in me, as people seem to like those two.

From where I am now, though, I've got to say I don't know if I could make a list ranking my favorite Doctors. I thought Hartnell was a little tough to love, but he was a very interesting character and got the ball rolling. Troughton was a lovable imp. Pertwee felt like he could have been the lead hero in the sci-fi version of The A-Team. Baker... he probably personified The Doctor as most of us *want* The Doctor to be (note I said most). Davison, I don't think I can really explain him yet, since I haven't had much time to mull him over, having finished watching his episodes yesterday.

Then I jump in awareness forward to NuWho and Eccleston, a covert op of the Time War, Tennant, the most dynamic Doctor to date in my opinion, and Smith... the hipster (sorry if you're a big Smith fan).

But generally speaking you're spot on, our 'free' transfers haven't been financially beneficial for us. We must cut down our wage bill and have our academy players fill in for the dead wood.

But at the end of the day, if FSG are actually willing to part with Meireles I think that only means positive things about future transfers.

true,JustJoshingLiek,null,null,"&gt;I'm pretty dumbfounded. Banning the entire population because sometimes a small number do things they shouldn't is a nightmare way to run a country.

Don't be getting the wrong idea, I'm not routing for this ban, I'm just noticing from what I've interpreted that the heart is in the right place, but it might not be the most sensible. I disagree 100% with the Daytime ban as that is just ridiculous, you can do whatever the hell you want. But the night-time ban is more understanding as it's dark, so obviously going to make it that much more difficult to interpret your surroundings, which is when accidents happen.  

&gt;Some people misbehave at football matches but no-one wants matches banned. 

I myself am not a fan of football, it attracts to much hooligans, but the reason the government or legal bodies not banning matches is because there is money to be made, which can have a link to the whole smoking debate. Smoking kills many people a year, yet it's still on our shelves.. why? Because it makes money.

&gt;You have to look at the big picture!

Are you serious? Clearly you are looking at a narrow field, I'm taking the views of both sides and developing my own opinion, from what I think is best. Day-Time ban= do not agree, Night-Time ban= 50/50.

&gt;Plus who says it's not wise and why?

I say it's not wise, what would you be doing in a forest at night anyway? What can you do except camping? You're not going to go biking or hiking at night. If you are in a dedicated forest, such as Tollymore Forest park, or something similar I say nighttime bans are totally of limits as you are 100% obliged to do anything you want within their site within obvious reason. Which is why I agree partly with the at night time ban, but disagree completely with the day-time ban. Are you just pissed of because you're being told what you can and cannot do? It's common sense really, just now the government has labelled it which is totally unfortunate and it honestly annoys me to.  

&gt;I can take care of myself thanks, I don't need the Government banning me places they think I might have an accident. I'm sick of the nanny state telling me what I can and can't do. There is going to be nothing left for our children that isn't totally sanitised and boring.

Honestly I see where you're coming from, I'm sick of the developing nanny state myself and there is probably more important matters to attend to but honestly, would you be letting your kids run about forests at night? There's plenty of things to do during the day, summer day light lasts longer, so a ban shouldn't become effective until it gets past twilight, which gives our children plenty to do til like 10ish. In the winter, the nights come early and it's also cold, you wouldn't really be out at night anyway unless you're at work or something. 

Basically, I don't agree with this ban. There are faults to it, what I believe is something controlled should happen at NIGHT TIME only. This also has to take into consideration the summer &amp; winter periods in which day light is increased or decreased.

Transcript of phone conversation with emergency operator:
Joe Horn: “I’ve got a shotgun; do you want me to stop them?”
The Pasadena emergency operator responded: “Nope. Don’t do that. Ain’t no property worth shooting somebody over, O.K.?”
Mr. Horn said: “But hurry up, man. Catch these guys will you? Cause, I ain’t going to let them go.”
Mr. Horn then said he would get his shotgun.
The operator said, “No, no.” But Mr. Horn said: “I can’t take a chance of getting killed over this, O.K.? I’m going to shoot.”
The operator told him not to go out with a gun because officers would be arriving.
“O.K.,” Mr. Horn said. “But I have a right to protect myself too, sir,” adding, “The laws have been changed in this country since September the first, and you know it.”
The operator said, “You’re going to get yourself shot.” But Mr. Horn replied, “You want to make a bet? I’m going to kill them.”
Moments later he said, “Well here it goes, buddy. You hear the shotgun clicking and I’m going.”
Then he said: “Move, you’re dead.”
There were two quick gunshots, then a third, and the 9-1-1 call ended.

Almost certainly. I'm tired of being told I can't do things which in no way harm others. The real problem is people can't think of a reason to be in a forest at night and therefore not worried about it being banned but the bigger picture is why would you agree to something being banned where there is no good reason. It doesn't matter with this issue because it doesn't bother you personally but what about when some law appears that does restrict you - you'll be looking for people to support your right to do something. People should fight restrictions on their rights and privacies purely because it's the right thing to do and just to re-iterate, I can't think of a single problem that a curfew will actually solve.

I also don't think anyones heart is in the right place - if it was they would have provided a useful argument as to why this is good legislation. This is pure laziness. The easiest way to curb problems with any area is to keep people out of it.

Plus just for the record, lots of people do stuff outdoors at night that are perfectly valid. Walking the dog after work, night hiking, night orienteering, through hiking, nature watching, fishing and games to name just the first few that come to mind.

&gt;would you be letting your kids run about forests at night

Why wouldn't I? Children would be much safer playing in a group in a forest than they would hanging around the local bus stop. Bearing in mind the single most dangerous place a child can be is near a road. Letting kids have some independence is part of growing up and teaches them self sufficiency. Plus I don't really advocate letting kids run around forests on their own but it is possible to let them go and play while you wander with the dog. The core issue here is bad parenting where adults don't know what their kids are up to and forests bans aren't going to turn those little gits into model citizens.

If humans had any sense, wisdom, conciousness and or savvy, we would be anarchists every one of us.

Either we will seize power of these systems and maintain them as we decommission industrial society or we destroy the political structure and create something new. Neither option looks too good from where I am sitting. 

In the context of nukular energy, I can only imagine what will happen to the hundreds of power plants worldwide abandoned after a collapse of civil society.  

Continued growth, I believe, is not an option. The oil will run out long before any alternative energy sources materialise. Infact, I think it's true that we can't generate energy like we get from oil and coal any other way.

1. The one in the bathroom gives Amy instructions about what to tell the Doctor, and that advice seems to contradict River's instructions to conceal what they saw on the beach. He killed the lady with the bad glasses, but I was willing to do that myself after her second memory wipe and I didn't even need to tell Amy anything. Could be helpful, could be an effort to guide the Doctor's actions toward their own goals. 

2. ""Silence (Silents?) will fall"" -- Odd warning/threat if you're talking about an enemy of the Doctor. OTOH the Silents could be working to bring about the silence, or a product of some phenomenon called silence, or the goal of the war could be the Doctor's final silence.

The fact of the matter is that there are some serious negatives to nuclear power obtained due to fission as we do today - but it's regulated well, it's arguably less environmentally dangerous, and is demonstrably safe when it's handled correctly. In order to make it safer and more efficient, we need *more* research into nuclear power - the USA has essentially given up on nuclear power until very recently, having built no new reactors in some time. The people leading the way are France, the UK and (believe it or not) the Indians/Chinese who have some experimental reactors being built that are very promising (molten salts etc).

I hope you don't think I'm a nuclear apologist, I'm not - but at the end of the day it's better to transform as much energy usage as we can over to electricity and then power that through sources such as wind, solar and yes - nuclear, so we can lower our dependance on coal, oil and gas.",0,1308854793,null,0,false,0,c21heot,t3_i71xa,t1_c21heot,t1_c21gmoc,1427277687,9,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,9

Sorry to hijack your thread, but the term ""renewable"" really riles me. Coal, gas and oil are all ""renewable""; that is, they're all being created all the time under the surface of our planet, just at a rate that is being far outstripped by the speed at which we use it.

On the other hand, solar power is not renewable - it's the product of nuclear fusion and there's only a limited amount of hydrogen in the sun. Once you capture the photons, that's it, they're gone, they can't be renewed.

Perhaps instead of using the word ""renewable"" we should be using ""sustainable"" and ""unsustainable"".
