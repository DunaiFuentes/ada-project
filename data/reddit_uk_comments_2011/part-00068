true,samsari,scottish,Scottish exile,"Thank you for keeping it civilised as well. I confess I thought you were one of those ""The Scots are being subsidised by English money! And now they want independence?! Let's dump them before they dump us!!"" people for a while, but I see now that I was wrong. Though, for the record if anyone else is unfortunate enough to try reading this long thread, I found [this](http://stephennoon.blogspot.com/2011/10/another-scotland-office-boomerang.html) very interesting indeed. Obviously, a pinch of salt may possibly be required. But it *is* from official figures...

Well, I absolutely welcome any and all input into the debate and discussion about independence. Despite everything else that is said, Scotland and England, not to mention Wales and N Ireland, are and certainly will remain very close friends. We all have a very old history together and probably nobody else in the world understands us like each other. So I can't imagine not seeking their advice. However, I still do not agree that the other members of the UK have an automatic moral right to have a say in the final vote. It is very much a personal decision that Scotland must make on its own, even though it does affect the rest of them. In cases like this, I strongly believe that the right of self determination trumps all.

When you left home for the first time, I presume you discussed it with your parents, and listened to their advice, but ultimately you probably did not ask for their actual permission. And why should you, you were an adult and your parents recognised that you had to make your own decisions, even though your mum was probably quite sad that you were leaving.

Personally, I think all members should secede from the UK. I'm certainly not going to try and argue that it was not the best decision that Scotland and England could have made at the time. I think both got more out of it than they expected. Great Britain became far more than the sum of its parts and both countries benefited massively from the arrangement. But now, after 300 years, I think it has served its purpose, it is an anachronism now. It's time to retire it and reform a different union under a different organisation. What I would like to see is the countries breaking up and then coming back together in a more relaxed mini federation. A council with 4 seats on it, certainly not numbers of seats proportional to population size. Like the oft-mooted Scandinavian Union. Scotland, England et al should be essentially autonomous and basically entirely politically distinct, but some things like defence, and other geographical things should be handled collectively. I don't believe it's possible to convert the UK as it now exists into this new form, thus I believe it must be build from the ground up. And of course, while we're at it, why should England not be broken up further. There are very good arguments to be made for at least four semi-autonomous regions that would be pretty easy to delineate. 

Also, I strongly disagree with your interpretation that the SNP ""lack the courage of their convictions"". As I understand it, they had planned a referendum bill in 2009 but withdrew it when it became clear that it would not pass because of concerted opposition from the other parties. They said at the time that they would instead campaign for the coming election on it instead, where they won very strongly. At which point they explicitly said they would hold the referendum in the second half of the parliamentary term (2014 or 2015) and have not said anything different since. So I don't think it's fair to accuse them of cowardice. Political nous, perhaps, at worst.

It sounds very much like you just dislike and distrust Labour (Scottish or otherwise) and I don't think there are as many in Scotland today who would disagree with you as might have done a few years ago. It seems that it is becoming clearer that Labour is not the friend of Scotland that many Scots thought it was. As your links suggest, Labour was just taking advantage of Scotland for its own benefit. Certainly Scottish Labour is a disaster at the moment, leaderless for 6 months now and no indication of regrouping after the rout at the election. Meanwhile, they still dance to the tune that UK Labour plays, a distinctly unionist tune. As you say, Labour is the dealer that wants to keep his customers hooked. But I think that is changing, the SNP finally offer another credible left-wing option. I will admit to being largely unaware of the corruption aspect though, so thank you for the education there.

The Barnett formula is old, and probably is in need of rework. But in a system where all regional tax revenues go into a central coffer and are then redistributed, I'm not sure how it could be done any better. It's not very fair, but it's equally unfair to everyone. As they say, a good compromise leaves everyone unhappy. I definitely agree that the different regions should have always been able to raise their own taxes. Blame the Acts of Union for that one, perhaps. 

England should have its own regional assembly. Or several. Localism makes a lot more sense today than it did even 50 years ago. There's no reason at all that granting half a dozen regional assemblies to parts of England would contribute to a less cohesive state. I really don't think England wants to leave the UK at all, but Westminster is too big and too unfair to expect any useful things to be done for individual areas of Britain. As you said, England is not a single party state, so while Scotland's needs are getting eclipsed in Westminster so are Cornwall's. The boost to Scotland's self-esteem first in 1999 with the parliament and more so this year with the SNP landslide has been transformative. The rest of Britain should enjoy the same benefits. After all, we're family and we should all want the best for each other. Also, a union or federation or whatever the future brings for these islands will be so much happier and more constructive if all the members in it are happy and satisfied with their places in life.",0,1319746322,null,0,false,0,c2uzahk,t3_ln1pn,t1_c2uzahk,t1_c2unyeo,1427792232,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

As it stands someone leaving politics can join the business world in a directorship role, in which they are paid very large amounts of money for very little work.

The reason business want them is for three reasons.

1) They have knowledge of how politics works so they can tell them where to apply pressure.
2) They have friends and contacts still in power so they can make that pressure more effective.
3) The role is a sham and a pre-agreed condition of some form of corruption whilst they were in power.

The higher up in politics they were the more money they get paid and the less work they have to do.

There's two deeply harmful things that come of it

1) Companies can buy access to politics and buy policy.
2) Corruption occurs where the people in government make policy in order to receive a bribe of a job after politics.

The cost of this in real terms is billions.

So rather than have it, why not give ex-PMs and ministers a golden handshake and ban them from getting involved in future.

true,bowling4meth,english,Straight out of Surrey,"Firstly, I'll apologise for cutting and pasting at seemingly random. I don't want to hit the comment limit. No, actually, firstly can I say thank you for such an interesting discussion. Even though we're from different sides of the border it's clear that we both have a good understanding of each other's views, accept them and are able to continue in such reasonable debate. Anyway, onwards and upwards...

&gt;I found this very interesting indeed. Obviously, a pinch of salt may possibly be required. But it is from official figures...

I'm not surprised. As I mentioned I'm a massive supporter of an independent Scotland if it benefits both Scotland and England. There's been powers in place to stop anyone from waking up and questioning the value in the union, which is horrible as we should question it all the time so that we get more of, or at least the same as we used to out of it.

&gt; However, I still do not agree that the other members of the UK have an automatic moral right to have a say in the final vote. It is very much a personal decision that Scotland must make on its own, even though it does affect the rest of them. In cases like this, I strongly believe that the right of self determination trumps all.

I liked your analogy (later in your comment) but feel it's not quite right for what there is. Scotland leaving the union would have a massive impact on both Scotland and on those that remain. I could understand your position if you were Manx, after all the departure of the Manx from the crown would cause a minor regionalised change, but Scotland is the second partner in the union (and I mean that only in terms of population and economy. Culturally, historically and in many other ways Scotland is every bit the equal partner to England, and without disrespect to Wales and Northern Ireland, the two - Scotland and England are the major parties). The departure of Scotland from the union would have a massive impact on the other states and to refuse them at least the voice would (imho and you've made your position clear, so I understand and accept that) be unfair. I also think that if it was right for Scotland to leave, that there would be support from the other kingdoms for the reasons you've made clear in so far as that auld enemy aside, we're actually always going to feel an affinity to each other, and some clans not withstanding, none of us are French (j/k).

&gt; It sounds very much like you just dislike and distrust Labour

Yes. I do. I also dislike and distrust the tories, the lib dems, the snp, plaid cymru and the northern irish parties. The only politicians I've ever met with any interest in the welfare of the people were Paddy Ashdown and Michael Foot, and I lobbied politicians in the Major and Blair administrations - well, I occasionally met them and had a lobbying firm working for me. The whole thing's corrupt from the top down. We really should burn it to the ground and start again, but that's just me being old and cantankerous.

I agree with much of what you're saying later but I don't think secession is right. I think we need to negotiate a new union, one that more fairly represents the mass of population in England than the status quo, but also one that removes the welfare trap in places like Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. Imagine if Wales could declare the valleys a corporate tax haven for any company that spends more than Â£1 million on employing local people each year? Imagine if Northern Ireland were able to provide tax breaks for Internet startups providing jobs to interns at Northern Irish universities? What if Scotland could say that for each retrained Scottish dock worker who spent more than 6 contiguous months unemployed before being re-employed in a call centre, that the Scottish government would waive employee NI contributions for 5 years?

England needs a parliament - you can't de-anglicise the British parliament without it. Assemblies won't cut it, that's what local authorities are supposed to be for.

The allowance is linked to the ceiling of the centralised arrangements for payment of staff and secretarial support for MPs with London constituencies.

Bacon salt, that green hot dog relish stuff, Hamburger Helper? All part of a balanced meal of course. Vegy substitutes could be used where called for if required, and bacon salt of all odd types seems both vegy, Kosher, and all the rest. I wouldn't bother with Tex Mex stuff, that is fairly well covered here, but perhaps some kind of unusual Cajun cooking sauce? Saw a lobster/ cray fish one on TV once that sounded great, but we do have some very good hot sauces as ingredients and condiments in general.

Premium saltines.

I am not sure on customs rules on open cured meats and agricultural products from the US, you may want to look at that.

A collection of odd types of Kool Aid. Could always be made with a sugar replacement product.

Edit. I think the sauce was Zatarain's shrimp and crab boil sauce or Louisiana crab boil on looking. A crawfish ( what you seem to call them ) boil looks amazing. If vegy, I'm sure it could easily be adapted someway, though not sure of ingredient formulation of sauce.

Add a local newspaper and a TV guide. If you have a relatively famous local or nearby author, particularly if talking of your area, add a book. Currency is not a daft idea, but throw in a 2 dollar bill and explain it's rarity/oddness. To any loose change, add circulated commemorative stuff like a Susan B. Anthony dollar, or a  Kennedy half dollar. They are odd, look good (maybe, Susan B was hated ) and have history. Stamps suck unless it's something pan global American like Sesame St or Elvis. Or is she is into philately? Doubt it.

Are Christmas/Easter holidays/celebrations cancelled? How will it affect the 70%ish of the public who call themselves Christian? Some people put a lot of faith in their religion and it could be very damaging for them personally. Will it be replaced with another spiritual/moral figure or is that element to be totally wiped out from Parliament? Is there a risk of agitating a far-right movement? Maybe, maybe not. What I'm saying is that there is a lot to take into consideration.

I don't think it's fair to compare the House of Lords to a dictatorship, although to be fair I don't think that is what you were saying. Can you not see the benefit of having a base that is stable and permanent but has limited advisory power (that can *always* be overruled by the commons)?
Sometimes it isn't a good idea to let the public decide either. I know that is controversial but can the general public be trusted to vote for the smartest over the most popular? Will the general population take the time to research the background of every single member who enters and does there have to be an expensive national vote on each one? It's not like having political parties, that kind of the whole point. I'm not saying how we do it now is correct and I don't know who should decide if things change, but like I was saying about the state religion- it's not a good idea to just get rid of institutions that are hundreds of years old without giving it some serious, deep thought.

I would suggest you go down and check it out. The occupation is not negative at all! When I went down last weekend there was a wide range of views, from the far left all the way to the liberal right. The general feeling was very positive and people wanted to talk about what was going on, the reasons for it and what the solution should be.

There was a very positive feeling :)

IMO all the govt needs to do to quell the public anger about what's going on is to sort out the housing and banking crisis. They have no intention of doing that, for ideological reasons, so the situation is going to carry on getting worse.

I'm not sure FWP makes any difference generally.

&gt;Why?

Because then you could figure out *why* people visit it at all. It's not like anyone thinks 'shall I google? Bah, Bing is much better'.

&gt;I find it odd when people quote what I've wrote and tear apart each and every fuck up with stupid quotes like this, but I don't know what else to do with your post.

Why odd? It's a conversation. It's partially what quotes are for, and makes reading easier for others....it would appear that you get upset even more easily than I do :-)

&gt;Are you trying to argue how IE/Bing/Yahoo is a FWP for the UK marketplace and we need to overwhelm the status quo? Or is it just one of those days sat at your PC bored?

Don't have time to be bored these days :-( I'm complaining about the status-quo, this sort of thing has gone on for long enough. I find it incredibly lazy for sites like this to pull 'jogger killed by rabies bite' stunts that needlessly scare people into clicking only to find out that they're talking about another country, never mind Entertainment puff. The 'well, ignore it' trick just encourages other sites to do the same. I don't use Ad-block for this reason - ignoring the problem isn't the same as addressing it.

true,generic_human_1979,null,null,"&gt; Has anyone considered that this class of people are routinely refused by planning permission even if they own the land?

Have you considered there may be perfectly valid reasons that they are refused and others are accepted? Property developers rarely (if ever) just buy a plot of cheap land and ask 'can we build here?'. They investigate the likelihood of getting planning permission before they buy anything. That alone would provide a significant skew to the statistics. A huge consideration for councils is the infrastructure to support the extra population in the area.

Mine have, and I have in the past (I'm allergic to wasps).
Trust me when I say, it is one of the scariest things you will ever experience in your entire life.
Someone you love is sitting next to you with their throat closing, tongue swelling and quite literally dying infront of you.
It is your job in that moment to remain calm, collected and helpful.
I'm sure it's true, that had I run through the restaurant screaming for an owner to give me the address, I could indeed have called the ambulance myself and coherently relayed the information.

The last time he had peanuts, he was in a coma for 2 weeks.
It took all my strength to keep it together and smile sweetly to the staff who were more concerned with my boyfriend's credit card than his life.

Well, feel free to carry on doubting. This submission obviously wasn't for you, if you've never seen this pattern of behaviour in any online or printed publication before.

&gt;Look at the top 2 comments:

You're now favouring the comment votes over the article ones. Sure, people like to bash yahoo or whoever - but they tend not to blindly upvote if the point being made doesn't have substance. Or are you the only one who might have a handle on people's opinions?

And the point being made isn't exactly a new phenomenon, either - I'm highlighting something that gets on people's nerves, that's exhibited by more than just Yahoo, regardless of whether you comprehend or agree.

&gt;because as stated no-one really uses it or cares.

I disagree. And in any case, this is akin to saying 'it's true because all my friends say so'. Stated by who, for instance? Are you seriously suggesting that Yahoo has no traffic?

&gt;I can't believe how much of a mountain you're making this into.

I'm not, you are - by failing to see the point, ignoring the context and the examples given, then making several vague statements about everyone else's opinions. Worthless Wisdom indeed.

&gt;Your bigger gripe should be that the articles are posted on uk.omg.yahoo which has the layout of a 14 year old girls gossip website and where each article doesn't extend 8 sentences.

That's a seperate gripe, that I agree with - but one thing at a time - I'd like the articles to have at least some relevance to the UK version of the site I'm visiting, if a UK version of a site is to have any meaning, before I bother looking at the text to find out that it has no relevance to my country.",0,1319812533,null,0,false,0,c2v660z,t3_lqt2v,t1_c2v660z,t1_c2v5w9u,1427795529,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

true,Ivashkin,null,null,"It really depends on what your aims are. The issue with OLSX is that it is a very broad and general protest, with no actual aims that can be met (as of yet). At the moment it's little more than a statement of discontent combined with an open forum for discussion, which is pushing it's luck with the law and doesn't have an end game. 

Where the occupation tactic would have worked is the student protests, that was a very simple demand and a had a clear end game, we're going to stay here until you rethink the Â£9K tuition fee limit. Had students peacefully occupied parliament square in the same numbers they were protesting in (tens of thousands) it would have been very difficult to evict, but very easy to see how it could be removed. No matter what you think of the Met or police in general, you have to admit they just would not be able to deal with civil disobedience committed by children on such a large scale. Had the students adopted the occupy tactic, in large numbers, it would have probably resulted in the plans going back to the house, or made it far easier for the LibDems or even sympathetic Tories to rebel against it.

As for OLSX, it's the type of thing which needs to breed as a country wide grass roots movement, over a longer time scale and in a more distributed fashion. They have a good point about wealth distribution and corporate lobbying, even to the point where people far outside the professional protest circuit agree with them. But so far all they have managed to do is get sidetracked into an irrelevant argument with St Pauls which is getting all the attention. So honestly, the immediacy and the pressure that you get from an occupation isn't going to work until they actually have a set list of demands they can occupy something over until they are met. Just occupying part of London for what appears to be no reason at the beginning of winter is farcical.

__I wish everyone would stop blaming 'Violent pornography'. Before this kind of porn became easily accessible, there *were still* violent rapes/murders.__

I posted about the 'extreme porn' being illegal in the UK a couple of weeks ago here... Tabak is a prime example of 'goody-too-shoers' blaming *THE PORN* for his actions and not the fact that some humans are just not right in the head, whether they watch it or not.

I was thinking alot about this at work and; I would like to point out I would love the utter shit that is on TV to be banned because of its 'anti-social aspects' and 'people get influenced so easily'. I would also love all the shitty glossy magazines, with size zero models in them, to be banned because it gives girls an unrealistic portrayal of how they should be *and possibly leads to a massive increase in anorexia and suicides amongst young females*. 

Finally, for research thought I would check out one of the well known red tops for comments... YEP. ""THIS IS WHY VIOLENT PORN NEEDS TO BE BLOCKED COMPLETELY FROM THE UK"" - give it a break...

I believe if you had a genuine public conversation about it, as had been done in the late 50s and 60s with the Wolfenden report (homosexuality) then you will find the numbers shifting a little. I am not for one moment suggesting you will get a massive shift but you would get a shift in opinion nonetheless once people hear what the other side has to say. This conversation, to my knowledge has not been had and the status quo not challenged. As we all know, this has to be done to move forwards sometimes as a society. 

I know all too well the few strong points in favour of monarchy and I accept them as very good points, however, the other side of the argument with equally good points never really make it out there to the public. You get the occasional bluster from all sides of the political spectrum i.e. Littlejohn, Hitchens, Dawkins, Mansfield et al but never a robust challenge.

Now I remember when becoming a member of a group meant getting leaflets and stickers through the post, so maybe I was totally naive but he hadn't asked for a donation or a standing order, so I felt a bit deceived. But I like Greenpeace anyway so I was happy to start a standing order, I told him what the amount would be (it's very low, I have set up standing orders for a small amount now I am skint and intend to increase them whenever I get a job). So he KNEW how much I wanted to give.

I realised I had filled out every detail (including signature and bank details) but not the amount, so I said 'I'll just fill this in' because he was clearly going to take the form off me and do it himself. He said 'ooh actually you can't give that amount, it won't go through, you have to give twice as much.' And I was like, 'what, I told you all along what amount I am happy giving.' 'Yeah it just won't go through, but it's not much more, is it? I mean that's like a drink a month, isn't it?' 'It's twice what I wanted to give, and I told you what I what I wanted to sign up for.' Then he just tried to guilt me into it, but I was too pissed off that he was clearly intending to sign me up for a higher donation that I'd agreed to, and that he was trying to guilt trip me because the amount I wanted to give was 'too low.' Fucker. Sorry greenpeace, you're getting nothing from me.

There absolutely can and should be a moral element to Parliament, and I trust that there are enough people to believe that in order to have one elected. 

&gt;I know that is controversial but can the general public be trusted to vote for the smartest over the most popular?

I take a lot of issue with this argument. Firstly yes I do think that the public can, and indeed must, decide who is most fit to govern. Secondly , being smart does not in its self make you the right person to make decisions; a far more important determinant is the value set upto which you will base you decision. I trust the public to elect people who represent their own value set, and I trust politicians to appoint those who reflect their own value set. The trouble with an appointed house is that the political class may not have the same value set as the public.

&gt;does there have to be an expensive national vote on each one?

Yes. Democracy is important. Furthermore in terms of overall government expenditure the cost of elections is practically nil. 

&gt;It's not like having political parties, that kind of the whole point.

Political parties operate in the house of lords. Furthermore they always will. To be a member of the lords is to be involved in the political process - to be a politician. The only difference between an elected an appointed house is accountability.

&gt;it's not a good idea to just get rid of institutions that are hundreds of years old without giving it some serious, deep thought.

It is not a good idea to stick to traditions for their own sake. Is there any government department that has been as exempt from institutional reform as The House of Lords? Would anyone ever with any credibility argue that reform of the NHS should happen at such a slow pace that the same debate is occurring a century later? 

This debate has been going on for over a century. It is far more simple than is made out by many. Should all those who hold political power have direct electoral mandate? I believe so. 

It's not enough to say it works more or less as it is; the US Senate works, the Irish Senate works, the Australian Senate works - elected senates work. Its been proven time and time again. 

The reason that reform has not gone through is because a reformed house would have credibility and would embarrass the almost equally antiquated Commons. ",0,1319837728,null,0,false,0,c2v9w7l,t3_lplay,t1_c2v9w7l,t1_c2v1ula,1427797351,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

true,Lavaburst,eccleston,Eccleston,"I started right on episode one of the 9th Doctor.  This is the first episode in the 2005 'version' that IMDB tracks.  I think it is THE best place to start.  I can't find the link that Timey_Wimey is referencing, although it is the link I used when I got started.  I copied the suggestion and I will include it here.

&gt;Start with Rose, the first episode of the '05 series. Just before the episode Dalek, watch Genesis of the Daleks from the classic series.
&gt;
&gt;Continue watching the new series until Tooth and Claw, after which you should probably watch The Hand of Fear from the classic series, and possibly K9 and Company (a backdoor pilot for a never-launched series), before continuing on to School Reunion.
&gt;
&gt;After The Girl in the Fireplace, take a few days to emotionally recover, then listen to the Big Finish audio drama, Spare Parts before watching Rise of the Cybermen.
&gt;
&gt;Continue watching again normally until you get to The Shakespeare Code, after which just read the Tardis Index File page for The Macra Terror (Actually watching the episode is impossible, although you could listen to it, read it, or browse the BBC's photonovel of it. It's a decent story, but it drags a bit.)
&gt;
&gt;Switch to the new series again until you finish Blink: Once you recover from that, watch the classic episode The Deadly Assassin, and ponder just how odd a title that is.
&gt;
&gt;Back to the modern series until you reach Planet of the Ood, at which point watch either The Sontaran Experiment or The Invasion of Time - the former is shorter, but the latter is a better story. Continue on to The Sontaran Stratagem, and beyond. Congratulations, you now have enough classic background information to be caught up.
&gt;
&gt;Or you could just watch the new series: The in-between jumpbacks I mention are more for richness of background rather than necessary material.

true,Tetzel,eng-manchester,Greater Manchester,"This happens to most students every year. Not the same details, but delayed payments and the like happen all the time.

Last year the system changed over so it meant tons of students got their money late (i didn't get mine until 3 months after i applied) If this is your first year, you'll probably be living in student accommodation? Or at least University recommended private accommodation. If you didn't choose one of these two options then they're going to be less lenient about bills, paying things in advance etc. Should have stuck with student accommodation for the first year. You also shouldn't have needed a guarantor if you went into that kind of accommodation, if you've gone somewhere private, most University's recommend private accommodation which doesn't need a guarantor. You can get all of your textbooks from the library for free. Some might just be referral books, but most you can take out and read, though really this won't be 100% necessary as you can do your work for the first year of Uni (especially the first few months) without having to have a textbook at hand, (just going to the library to do work before lectures/seminars.) If you go to a doctor in your new (?) city they could get you any/all medication you need for free, all you need to do is a simple registering process with a new doctor (Uni's also have help available with this, what doctor to choose etc.)

The guys at Student Finance are just trying to do their job with what they have available. What they have available is a clunky system in need of a serious streamline/overhaul, thousands of students with all sorts of different issues that set them apart from the average student.

Yes it sucks that they lost your deed poll. Yes it sucks there was a lack of communication. Yes it can be frustrating. They lost my birth certificate when i did mine and there was nothing i could do about it until they returned it a few months later out of the blue.

The system is bad and it does have failings, but you should speak to someone at your University about any and all problems you're having of this nature. There's usually someone on hand at a student services centre who can refer you to the right person.

Your application should take 2 weeks now i think. That's how long it took me after mine got sorted out (3 months after i originally applied.)",0,1319851299,null,0,false,0,c2vbgax,t3_lsqto,t1_c2vbgax,t3_lsqto,1427798086,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

I don't deny that you might have felt 'something' when you saw/heard about Tabak, but you can say that about *anyone* in such a situation.

true,DogBotherer,null,null,"The only logical reason buying and selling sex is different from buying and selling any other service is because the relative positions of power of the two parties to the transaction _may_ (depending on various factors) undermine the voluntary nature of the exchange.  Of course, there are a whole bunch of moral and religious issues tied up with it too, but they don't make it logically distinct from buying other services.  

So, on the issue of prostitution generally, I disapprove of exploitation and we should obviously seek to prevent this (with laws when appropriate), but in general people should be free to make whatever voluntary exchanges of goods and services they wish.  Indeed, many women (and men) who sell sex would argue they sometimes feel more powerful than their clients, and prefer whatever degradation is involved in a half hour sex transaction to the equivalent money's worth of dull, dead end, soul destroying labour.

Paid for S and M sex is obviously something of a different beast, at least in the sense that the risk of real exploitation and psychological/physical harm is greater.  But, in essence, it can still be an entirely voluntary transaction, acceptable even enjoyable to both parties (indeed, often it will be the sex worker who is in the dominant position, which they may even find empowering).  Nonetheless, it obviously bears greater scrutiny.

So, does visiting prostitutes make a man depraved?  Not necessarily.  It may do, it may also make him a cheat, which is another issue.  Assuming he always is careful to monitor to the best of his ability the 'voluntariness' of the exchange, and to treat those sex workers he engages with the same respect due to any other person, I personally have no problem, and nor do I think it says anything about his character beyond he has sexual needs which are not being satisfied in non-financial ways.

http://www.ipa.org.au/publications/1824/does-more-equal-really-mean-all-better-
Does more equal really mean all better? - Julie Novak

[...]
A major rebuttal of the empirical analysis and policy conclusions by Wilkinson and Pickett has been recently presented by Christopher Snowdon, in his book The Spirit Level Delusion: Fact Checking the Left's New Theory of Everything.

Wilkinson and Pickett's analysis repeatedly commits what is known as the âecological fallacy,' whereby spurious conclusions about individual characteristics are drawn from group level characteristics.

As stated by Snowdon, âThe Spirit Level relies on the conceit that wealthy countries are basically the same, with inequality being the main difference between them. Consequently, any disparity in social problems must be the result of inequality. This is faulty logic and a classic ecological fallacy'.

It is invariably a short step from this to demonstrate that Wilkinson and Pickett regularly confound correlation with causation, a basic error in any endeavour within the natural or social sciences.

This is powerfully illustrated by Snowdon, with his take down of the Wilkinson-Pickett scatter plot method to show that, supposedly, alcohol consumption âcauses' divorce and recycling âcauses' suicide!

Perhaps the most damning criticism of The Spirit Level by Snowdon is its tendency for its results to rely upon the selective use of data and, in some cases, what appears to be outright data mining.

For example, Wilkinson and Pickett use UN Human Development Report data for 2004 to show a lower average life expectancy for those residing in more unequal countries. Strangely, Wilkinson and Pickett use data from the 2006 report elsewhere in their book. In addition, some countries such as the Czech Republic, Hong Kong and Slovenia are missing from the illustration presented in The Spirit Level.

Snowdon shows that when the 2006 life expectancy data is plotted against inequality, and all relevant countries are considered, there is in fact a positive correlation between the two measures. For good measure, Snowdon was able to find a similar relationship using 2009 data.

When subjected to even the basics of critical testing, for example which countries are included in the sample or whether or not published results can be replicated, The Spirit Level is simply found hopelessly wanting.

But there's one aspect of the solution that nobody seems to mention.

There is nothing magic about 9:00 AM. If we switched to Euro time, wouldn't Scots be perfectly entitled to start going to work at 10 am when it's light instead?   People in other countries adapt to their climate and conditions, without being tied to 9.AM. In the US, people on the West coast get up way earlier than Easterners, so they can do business across the country. In hot places, people get their stuff done early in the morning so they can hide from the sun in the hot part of the day. I'm guessing that within the CET time zone people do stuff at different times of the day in northern Sweden versus southern Italy.

It makes sense for the whole UK to be on the same time as Europe, but it doesn't follow that Scots should be slaves to a schedule that's appropriate for people living in London.

Of course, that's where the problem is. My line of work puts me into fairly regular contact with prostitutes, and I see how their lives operate when they're not with the clients, and it's rarely a voluntary thing. Most of them are being controlled by fairly dangerous individuals that force them into street work through manipulation and fear, or they do it because they need to fund a drug habit and have run out of options. It's grotty and unpleasant, and the whole industry reeks of exploitation and desperation. 

So while in principle, using prostitutes doesn't make someone depraved, it does cause me to question their moral compass, because I know without a doubt that I could never contribute to such an industry. 

Obviously i'm only talking about street prostitution here, since that's my area of expertise. I don't know much about escort services or higher class prostitutes, that may be completely different.

Part of the reason for wanting to match European time is to make it easier to trade with Europe. Look at other large countries: China and India both go for unified time, and most smaller countries don't follow time zones exactly, they would rather have the whole country in the same time zone.

Indeed, no where in the world, with the exception of Baffin Island in Canada, do the time zones split exactly where they should: they wait for a convenient place. States in the USA are not split into 2 parts, the lines fall between states. I would argue that the differences, and line between Scotland and England is not a useful line to split that down, especially considering it should be on the same time zone as England, as it is only further North, not East or West.

That coupled with an increase in car ownership was the origin of the ridiculous school run, the loss of the idea that walking is a valid mode of transport and general ridiculous helicopter parenting (in my opinion).

The original IR footage indeed proves nothing. On automatic scaling an IR camera will constantly re-distribute its colour pallet across the entire temperature range the imager is seeing (as evidenced in this video). Put something very warm in shot and not only will it appear warmer then its surroundings; everything else will look cooler then before as the camera re-adjusts to a wider temperature range.

Normally this mode is used for individual photos for manual adjustment at a later point. The way to undertake any sort of comparison is with a manually defined and consistent temperature range.

The other big problem with the method used is the lack of a temperature scale displayed against the original imagery.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt; http://everything2.com/title/The+Dark+Side+of+Jimmy+Savile

Of transient interest in mid 2000 was an emailed meme, one which purported to be a transcription of out-takes from an episode of 'Have I Got News For You'. The show - the seventh in the seventeenth series - was broadcast in May 1999. Apart from the regular cast, which at the time included Angus Deayton, the guests were Diane Abbot, MP and Sir Jimmy Savile, OBE. Shortly thereafter an irresistable e-mail starting doing the rounds, a supposed transcription of cut dialogue which cast Jimmy Savile in a poor light. There was mention of a scandal involving a young girl, and subsequent financial reparations in lieu of further media coverage.
The meme became controversial on account of its dubious legitimacy and libellous nature. So libellous was it that at least two UK-based internet sites were temporarily suspended by their ISPs as a result, including the thorough, scholarly comedy analysis website 'Some of the Corpses are Amusing'. SOTCAA was often cited as the source of the transcript, whether leaked by the producers of 'Have I Got News For You' or written by SOTCAA themselves, or by a third party, prime suspects being Chris Morris and Victor Lewis-Smith.

The following page delves into the saga, from the point of view of a website publisher whose ISP asked him forcefully to remove the transcript, citing a previous case in which an ISP was found liable for content published via its servers. It contains a link to an edited version of the original:
http://www.trashcity.org/ARTICLES/NEWSXXX.HTM

The transcript is either an entirely invented piece of comedy writing, or it is a modified transcription of an out-take, or it is a genuine transcription of an actual out-take. It is therefore either defamatory or a breach of copyright, and I do not reproduce it here. It is noticeable that Jimmy Savile's name is spelled incorrectly throughout the script - his name has one L, as in 'vile' - and that no mainstream media outlet subsequently picked up on the substance of the core allegation. Furthermore, a quip about 'miners' seems very contrived for something which is not scripted. The line continues just long enough to make it clear that Savile is making a pun on the word 'minors'. If it did not, the transcriber would not know to write 'miners', and this has an air of deliberation about it.

The one substantive fact which could be used to check the transcriptions accuracy - the name 'Sarah Cornley' - only returns links to pages which host the transcript, and indeed the node Sarah Cornley here on Everything2 is sourced entirely from the information contained in this very node.

The transcript is well-written and I can remember feeling shocked when I first read it. Savile is a strange man who lives a solitary existence; unlike myself, however, he has spent most of his adult life entertaining children. There are persistent, unfounded rumours that he is a necrophilic paedophile with a Norman Bates-esque fixation on his late mother. He inspires fear in a great many people. But so far there is no evidence that the information in the transcript is true or accurate.

TL;DR: Probably libellous bullshit.",0,1319903522,null,0,true,0,c2vf2x6,t3_lt7d8,t1_c2vf2x6,t1_c2veuff,1427799796,16,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,16

English is a broad term that encompasses a number of varieties of the language.  It is even possible to take some extremes from within this umbrella term that will not be mutually intelligible (at least when spoken).  Thus, it is necessary at times to give more specific labels to varieties.  This software will have been developed in (American) English and then given options for other languages. When British English was added it had to be specified, since ""English"" was already the default option.

As a linguist, it makes me embarrassed for my country to see the snobbiness many people here have about the language and American use of it.  We did not invent the language, our particular usage is no more correct than anybody else's, and we have no more claim to it than the speakers of proto-germanic or even proto-indo-european that it evolved from.

* Donna being ripped from her almost-life in Forest of the Dead.

* The End of Time, when Wilf and Ten are talking about the Doctor doing some things wrong, just a bit when he's in restraints and talking to the Master, then when the Doctor has his breakdown, then again when he regenerates. 
* Amy's choice in Amy's Choice.
* The end of The Pandorica Opens. 
* Saying goodbye to Amelia in The Big Bang (both times).
* Ghost of Christmas Future in A Christmas Carol. 
* When the Doctor finds out who River is and says hello.
* Saying hello to Sexy in The Doctor's Wife.
* Amy's room in the God Complex, followed by him saying goodbye to the Williams family. That whole conversation. He gives this almost wink after telling Amy to look after Rory and then the damn frown/music.

Should angry and disenfranchised people fighting against racism in the only way they know how be punished? Shouldn't they be listened to instead?

The biggest difference in the black/white reduction in crime rates is simply racism, and anger about that racism from the oppressed.

All of the UK is trending towards lower marriage rates, and single parent families. If what you're saying is true, then crimes going to increase massively - perhaps increased crime is just a blip during the time of change and adjustment, when those without fathers see those with fathers and it has a negative effect on them?

When the vast majority of kids don't have fathers, perhaps then crime from this effector will decrease?

That would explain why there's higher crime in the black community... black families have entered the adjustment period first! The good news is they'll be out of it first in a generation or two.

As for job-hunting I won't lie to you... it's not fun out there at the moment. It really depends what you are looking for. In my case, I had the option of going into developer work etc, but that's not what I want as I'm emigrating in a few months to marry and do a Masters in Japan. I have a next plan in the works so I won't be able to give you first hand knowledge on exactly how easy it is. 

There is plenty of work out there in the meantime to do to make ends meet if you can't find something ideal, exactly what you wanted or related to your degree course, you just need to take what you can to begin and then be prepared to move on if something better crops up. Start looking at specialist websites now, it gives you a really good idea about what is going on.

The CDEC centre in the library is really helpful. They don't always have amazing jobs, but when they do they are pretty cool opportunities. They are also very knowledgable and have good resources.

I agree completely.

&gt;We are not responsible to do everything. We are saving their damn lives

Well this is hardly a reasonable position. Would you have a country ignore their constitution and rule of law because a foreign country is blackmailing you to? If someone (hypothetically) made similar demands to the U.K., you can be sure there would be a proper discussion on the topic in parliament. 

&gt;the least they can do is organise and execute the requirements.

I feel like I already addressed this point in my previous post. 

&gt; ""Do what we say or starve. You don't have to do it all at once but get the ball rolling. We wont cut aid if we see you are following the spirit of the agreement. It is up to you to organise and execute the requirements""

I'm glad you feel this way seeing as that's exactly what Cameron seems to be doing, and I feel like this is a reasonable and realistic approach. The original discussion was regarding the title of the submission *Why does he only ""threaten""?*, and more specifically, why isn't the aid cut first, until the problem is solved, as opposed to the current approach of ""empty"" threats?

I really don't see where you get off with your attitude after you've refuted none of my points and I've been nothing if not constructive in my replies.

There is no problem with cutting aid to countries that refuse to change or rectify human rights issues. Nobody has said that they shouldn't change.

But swapping the carrot for the stick in such a swift, radical change, will only hurt poorer areas, undoing anything that the aid has done in the past.

I've never had an elderly person hold a door open for me, which is OK because they're old and weak and I can do it myself - but much worse I can't think I've ever actually had even a nod of thanks from an old person for holding a door open for them, or for getting out of their way, or for making room for them to go before me in any capacity, where-as younger people do so a slim majority of the time.

Every time anyone dares to talk about regular mandatory driving tests for old people, there's uproar from their little (actually huge) pseudo unions, so 88 year old greta gets to keep on nearly killing people every day.

Most old people seem to expect everyone to work around them, which you know what? I can deal with. They're old and physically generally weak, and it's a good society that makes allowances, helps out a bit, and tries to make their lives a bit easier. But what does one get in return for this? Never a word of thanks, dirty looks if you dare to look different than the 1950's little bobby idol they all have, and a group of people who are the most bigoted, racist, sexist people in the country.

true,kinggimped,null,null,"Very late as only recently discovered this subreddit, but thought I'd throw my thoughts into the mix.

As a purist, I'd recommend starting with *The Day Today*, which was a parody of a news/current affairs TV programme, masterminded by Chris Morris of *The Jam* and *Brass Eye* fame. Steve Coogan plays Alan Partridge in that, as the ever-intrepid sports reporter in the studio, as well as a host of other characters in other segments. Even though Coogan is very much a bit part in the show, it's still fantastic and well worth watching, and it gives you an opportunity to see the early days of Partridge before he was really rounded out as a character. If you like *TDT*, definitely check out *Brass Eye*. No Coogan, but it's pure unadulterated genius, especially the ""Paedogeddon"" special.

I would actually recommend watching *Knowing Me, Know You* after watching both series of *I'm Alan Partridge*. The shows have a very different kind of comedy to them - *IAP* is much more approachable as a straight comedy show in my opinion. It has its painfully awkward moments, but *KMKY* is a talk show car crash and I think it's actually better to watch it once you're a bit more familiar with his character. *I'm Alan Partridge* has got to be one of the most quotable TV shows ever made.

I'd also strongly recommend watching *Steve Coogan: The Man Who Thinks He's It* and *Live 'N Lewd*, his two early standup performances (the former is much better, in my opinion). Although Alan Partridge is the most famous character, Coogan's other characters are awesome and makes you realise that he's a ridiculously versatile character comedian, even though he's mostly famous for Partridge. Duncan Thickett and Tony Ferrino are genius. There's also a more recent standup show from 2009 (*As Alan Partridge And Other Less Successful Characters*), which is definitely worth watching, though in my opinion not as good as the earlier two.

As for other Coogan stuff, I'd heartily recommend the recent 6-part TV show he did with Rob Brydon, *The Trip*, in which he plays a somewhat exaggerated version of himself. If you enjoy that, you'll probably love the movie *A Cock &amp; Bull Story*, which is in much the same vein (mostly Brydon annoying the hell out of Coogan).

Plenty of torrents available for everything I've mentioned, though obviously I recommend giving the man his dues and buying it if you can. *I'm Alan Partridge* and *KMKY* are definitely available on DVD from Amazon UK, and I'm sure most of the other stuff is too.",0,1319992018,null,0,false,0,c2vmo3f,t3_hc40g,t1_c2vmo3f,t3_hc40g,1427803437,1,false,AlanPartridge,t5_2sbxu,1

Indeed, Bale is the easy pick.  Ironically, this guy is *always* the easy pick.  He is the perfect pairing with Modric, who dictates pace and action.  He controls the entire pitch and has the highest motor of any player out there.  Truly an inspiration.

true,DavidLuiz4,present,Didier Drogba,"I agree with most of what you said, and I was pretty entertained yesterday regardless of how let down I felt afterwards.

But it should be clear to everyone here that AVB's philosophy isn't suited to the current playing staff. I love what AVB is doing and the type of play that Chelsea is aspiring to these days, but people have to understand that we probably won't be successful trophy wise this season and maybe even next season. 

This is because the spine of the team, or at least the spine of the team for the last 5-6 years, Terry, Lampard, and Drogba, do not fit into this style of play. Terry is slow but very physical- great in a deep defence but probably a little suspect with a super high line and a pressing game. Lampard is one of my favorite players ever but someone like Modric would really be superior in this system to aid ball circulation and add a little more fluidity. The extent of Lampard's playmaking is mostly just first time right footed balls over the top and simple square balls. Of course he scores goals, but we have forwards for that. Drogba has looked completely lost and even in his prime is more suited to the battering ram approach where everything goes through him whereas nowadays our forwards are supposed to interchange and find space.

Add to that the fact that a lot of our supporting cast are also on the way down or do not fit AVB's style of play: mainly Malouda, Anelka, Alex (Bosingwa also just kind of sucks) and the fact that some of the new generation still need more experience playing for AVB: mostly referring to Sturridge who is very talented but raw and also extremely 1 footed, and we have a team that probably won't win the title.

I don't really mind of course. Like I said, I love what AVB is doing, and the transition is going to be necessary at some point or another, but fans need to realize what's going on with the club.

People in the UK should be aware of what UK banknotes look like, I appreciate that a Scottish fiver might be rare down south and possibly confusing given that there are three different banks in Scotland issuing notes but I'd hope that there was at least one person in the shop able to identify it as pounds sterling.

I know I'm probably asking for a lot there and wouldn't be surprised if a sixteen year old checkout assistant had never seen a Scottish note before but it's a source of continual frustration for Scots visiting England... your money is either flat out refused or you have to stand around while a group of people hold your money up to the light and look blankly at it as if you'd tried to pay using rubles.

Against lesser teams he may be able to produce some magic but against the top teams he is a waste of space mainly due to his lack of closing the opponents down and helping out at the back. He just gives the ball away in the middle of the pitch time and time again and then  drops his head and relies on Derry and Faurlin to clean up the mess left behind.

I'd much rather see Mackie start the next match knowing that his heart is in it and will chase every ball. Taarabt just looks like he doesn't care. I can't see him moving back to the Championship and no one in England will want him so I can see him going to a small team abroad somewhere, probably back to France. I think all the rumours of the likes of Lazio, Napoli, PSG wanting him won't mean anything after seeing his performances this season.

I am genuinely gutted as I wanted him to do well for himself and QPR but his ego has stood in the way. I feel he does have the talent to do well in the PL but is just lazy more than anything and thinks he doesn't have anything left to prove.

Except they don't, because they have expensive accountants that move money offshore to avoid tax.

This ""but the rich pay so much tax"" argument has been debunked time and time again. Realistically, the middle classes are the ones most hit by tax, because they can't afford to avoid it and jump through all the loopholes.

&gt; On lobbying David Cameron said 'It'll be the next great big scandal' and he's putting in the work to make sure lobbying is much more regulated.

They *say* this but the Conservative government is practically funded by these lobbyists, so they aren't going to bite the hand that feeds them.

&gt; We have social healthcare, a very substantial safety net for those who can't or won't work.

And the Tory government is trying to cut these things because they see them as unnecessary. If you join some localised anti-cuts movements, you'll see thousands of examples of things like, for instance, care homes having to close because the funding has been cut so badly.

This is bullshit. You can use the figures [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Income_in_the_United_Kingdom#Taxable_income) but I doubt you will because it doesn't fit in with your preconceived notions, so I'll do the maths for you. 

I will use the averages as they're catagorised by ranges. To be in the top 1% in the UK you must earn Â£117K or more. I will be using this [calculator](http://listentotaxman.com/index.php) to work out the tax they paid. 

300,000 tax payers @ Â£150K earnings = Â£16.908bn in income tax and NI

89,000 tax payers @ Â£350K earnings = Â£12.314bn in income tax and NI

16,000 tax payers @ Â£750K earnings = Â£4.837bn in income tax and NI

6,000 tax payers @ Â£1m earnings = Â£2.429bn in income tax and NI

Total paid NI and Income tax = Â£36.488bn

I found it very hard to find the amount of income tax collected for 04/05 like those stats are from, but found some for [06/07](http://www.nao.org.uk/publications/0607/accuracy_in_processing_income.aspx). Note that this was during a boom so is probably higher than the actual stats. 

Either way, Â£149bn is the amount I will use, and that comes to the top 1% paying roughly 24.5% of all income tax paid to the government. This isn't even taking into account the extra council tax they pay for living in bigger houses, the more VAT they pay since they purchase luxury goods, etc. 

I hope that helps. It took me fucking ages.

If you want to hit second home owners, in order for people to hold wealth in forms that aren't part of the housing stock it's quite difficult. You could look at charging extra council tax on top, but it'd be an administration nightmare having to prove someone had two homes etc. You could charge extra on BTL mortgages, but that'd probably hit hardest on (small) landlords rather than second homes. I can't really think of a way to do it. Although in all honesty I'm happy for small landlords to get the shaft. It would be a relatively easy tax to impose and collect, the difficulty would be on people with residential mortgages who rent out.

I study @ LJMU, The area in the city center is what (I guess) you'd expect from any city, but to you it probably looks really European with all our small cars and fancy buildings haha.

Liverpool people or 'scousers' usually have a pretty bad reputation on the interweb and in general in the UK, many people consider scousers as thieves and criminals, but I personally have never had any trouble (Other than my bike being stolen), and I think its a great place. (Other than the dull weather all the time).

Another possible University to look at is Edge Hill, [Link](http://www.edgehill.ac.uk/), its about 15/20 miles from the city center though (estimate).

I guess it happens (like anywhere in the world), But Liverpool is a very multi-cultural city, in LJMU where I study there are lots of variations in ethnicity and race. Its a tough question to answer but I'd say you can rest assured that racism is pretty rare.

Public transport is great, you have a very reliable rail service [Merseyrail](http://www.merseyrail.org/) which operates all over Merseyside and the Wirral. [Map](http://www.merseyrail.org/assets/network2.html). Buses are also pretty reliable here.

I personally don't drink very often but there are plenty of clubs/pubs about the city, there are also (relatively) frequent 'Reddit meetups' for Liverpool redditors.

Biking is pretty easy, but of-course you have to be careful. There are a fair amount of bike lanes but it can get a little sketchy in some areas. I cycle the 5 mile journey to and from LJMU every day. If you take it easy and ride safe there won't be a problem. Liverpool is also pretty flat so there are no huge climbs to worry about on a bike :)

Since you will be living over here, the government offer Student Finance. I'm not sure of the international terms/conditions but for me, the government pays my tuition fees (Â£3000+) per year, and gives me loans to use to help me survive and pass my course. I live at home, but the universities offer student accommodation which is affordable, but obviously lacks any luxuries.

I don't think Liverpool is an expensive place to live, but obviously as a student you need to be careful with your money. If you're staying around the city center near university, you wont need a rail pass, so you can save money there. There are also plenty of retail jobs/fast food jobs to help out. If you stay in Student halls provided by University I'm pretty sure they have internet and phone lines to use, but I'm not sure of costs.

Hopefully a student who lives in this accommodation can be more help, but I don't know much about it.

Edit:

Also, student tuition fees at the moment are being raised to between Â£6,000 and Â£9,000 per year, the government still pays it, it just means more debt when you graduate.

I don't like him but I can't really change that so I watch the show because it's the show I've been watching since a kid.

However, when someone just introduces the current doctor into past affairs, it's just a tiny bit aggravating. I want to be able to reflect sometimes on the other Doctors without seeing the new one. To remember that other people have played the Doctor besides Matt Smith. To realize that it is an older actor who still deserves the respect and kindness of everyone because without which we wouldn't really have the same times we would right now. 

So please. Just if it's about David Tennant or Peter Davison or Tom Baker, don't bring up Matt Smith.

&gt; transmitting a signal that allows authorities to shut off phones remotely, intercept communications and gather data about thousands of users in a targeted area.

Absolute bollocks. It transmits the same broadcast code that makes mobiles give up their IMSI and IMEI numbers so they can connect to that network, nothing more, nothing less.

Oh look, they actually said as much in the second non-sensationalized paragraph, and yet still felt it necessary to add more FUD.

&gt; forcing hundreds of mobile phones per minute to release their unique IMSI and IMEI identity codes, which can be used to track a person's movements in real time.

Nope, to track as PHONES move in and out of what is essentially a dummy cell. The existing mobile phone networks have been able to triangulate ANY phones position for years, by working out which 3 cell towers are closest to a unit, but they don't (officially) do it, as it would congest the network by repeatedly disconnecting and re-requesting for reconnect of every phone inside the cell. Plus the fact it's highly innacurate.

Hypothetically, it's like having a butler in your living room. He can announce that ""Sir has arrived in the living room"", and ""Sir has now left the living room"" ... but he has absolutely NO knowledge about whether ""Sir"" is in the bathroom, or the kitchen, or indeed protesting (looting) in Central London.

This system also cannot remotely shut down a phone ... it might interfere with your actual providers signal if it was close enough, but that's more collateral damage than any malicious purposes.

Neither does it ""intercept communications"" apart from those that say ""Unit 123 is in Area 456"". And the only ""data gathering"" it does is ""there are a shitload of phones in this area with the following IMEI and IMSI numbers"".

An IMEI number no more identifies an individual than an IP address identifies an an individual. At best it identifies a piece of equipment that may be using a wifi or cell signal in a certain place at a certain time. It says NOTHING about the user holding that phone.

true,Peter-W,uk,United Kingdom,"&gt;In a review of university admissions published on Monday, Ucas acknowledges that the current system gives an unfair advantage to pupils at private schools. These pupils are encouraged by their teachers to apply to institutions well ahead of the official deadline and, for some courses, applying early gives students more of a chance of being offered a conditional place, the review admits.

Of course it bloody well does. As much as people might not like it, most private schools provide a much better education and help their pupils a lot more when it comes to applying to University. If you didn't get value for your money people wouldn't send their children there...

The problem here isn't that private schools are cheating the system somehow, but that your local comprehensive is absolutely useless and provides next to no help at all. We shouldn't have a race to the bottom and tell private schools it is unfair they are doing things right, but rather try and improve comprehensive schools.

&gt;At present, too many pupils have to apply to universities before they have had time to properly research what and where they want to study, Ucas argues. This favours students whose families are familiar with the university application process and puts the rest at a disadvantage.

This of course is nonsense. You have a whole year of A-Levels to decide what you want to study and where, in fact you have 16 years prior to that. UCAS doesn't ""favor"" families with experience applying, but favors people who are correctly able to fill in a form, what do you want them to do?

Because that would be unfair. Once you go down that road we'll end up like America where an Asian student has to get grades 3x higher than a Black one to get into University.

If anything the Universities shouldn't know who's from a private school a who isn't. That would be a far better way of doing things.

Well no. You assume University (at least for a bachelors degree) is anything more than expensive babysitting much like the schooling before it. You don't want clever people in your establishment, you want those that have proven they are good at leaning and can score an A* on their essays while not understanding the subject. University students are **literally** just a source of income, with only the top 0.1% being of any use the the Uni.

You're so completely and utterly wrong about undergrads not being able to contribute to research programs that I had to respond.

* My research project involved working directly for Post Doctorate researchers to complete a demonstration of the tech that they work working. This will be in smart phones and TV sets over the next few years. My part wasn't big but it let me learn and it let the researchers have more time to do more important work.

* My girl friend has two publications as a direct result of her undergrad project.

* A friend I know that studies Biro-chemistry discovered some novel way DNA altering enzymes can work in a massively complex way that I will never understand.

* Another friend that, also, did bio-chem was doing crazy research into RNA.

* Another friend of mine worked on an Engineering project that directly lead on to his PHd. He might not even be doing a phd at all if it wasn't for this.

These might be purely anecdotal, but I don't know if there are any statistics on this but my guess would be that its much higher than 0.1%, at my uni virtually every half decent project related to research that was ongoing. Also, just because someone didn't go to a  Russell Group University doesn't mean they can't do research or that they aren't smarter or more capable at it than others that did, it can take some people longer to find their stride; you can't just select people based on their age or even their A level results this will not foster good researchers any more than simply going on IQ tests or recommendation from teachers.",0,1320056913,null,0,false,0,c2vto5r,t3_luz4o,t1_c2vto5r,t1_c2vtjvy,1427807292,7,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,7

I want to do Medicine, but my lack of experience and readiness for the application deadline (which I'm not going to blame on my school, though they could've helped) is why I'm taking a gap year.

It's gotten to the point that because I did a lot of research on personal statements, and am pretty good at the art of bullshitting, that I have had a hand in writing many of my friend's personal statements, as well as proof-reading them.

But now I see both downvotes (Reddit being as it is, I'm *too* not sure that they're ""real"") and several ""original"" (posted as a direct reply to my MOTM-thread) comments about the same player.

I'm not the one who's trusted to do the MOTM-sidebar, but I'm sure they'll be confused as well. Seeing as the second most popular pick (Bale) only has 28 votes I don't think it will be hard to realise that Scott Parker probably was our MOTM, as the most popular Parker-child comment has 34 votes.

Private schools do provide a better education in some ways, but they secure disproportunately better places at university even given this. *That* is one of the things people pay for.

For example, my at my undergraduate institution, Oxford, state school educated students consistently achieve more firsts at undergraduate when compared to peers of a similar level of school achievement. And yet the university doesn't take account of this by, for example, down rating its appraisal of a straight A student from private school compared with a straight A student from a state school.

And whenever a university makes the epistemically sensible choice of considering school background when evaluating performance, like Bristol does, a huge outcry is generated papers like the *Mail* and *Torygraph*.

What does 'familiar with the application process' actually mean? Applying to university or college isn't something you do on a weekly basis, no matter how middle class and affluent you are.

true,SirMuttley,cnty-uk,British in Bangkok,"&gt; In a review of university admissions published on Monday, Ucas acknowledges that the current system gives an unfair advantage to pupils at private schools. These pupils are encouraged by their teachers to apply to institutions well ahead of the official deadline and, for some courses, applying early gives students more of a chance of being offered a conditional place, the review admits.

I'm confused, did the review actually specifically say that private schools and the rich get an unfair advantage. Or did it just say that those that apply early get a better chance of an offer and the Gruniad just put their own spin on it? I'm looking through the [review](http://www.ucas.com/documents/admissionsprocessreview/APR_Consultation_evidence_base.pdf) at the moment can't see any mention of private schools.

**edit:** seems I was looking at the wrong document, [here](http://www.ucas.com/documents/admissionsprocessreview/APR_Consultation_FINAL.pdf) is the correct one.

I found this one mention regarding independent schools:

&gt; Some applicants, particularly younger learners at independent schools, are often advised to apply early in order to maximise their chances of getting an offer.

Or are you required to actually subscribe for everything, in which case you may have a point.

However, I do believe there's a way to reset at least your IMEI, thus rendering the system useless for anyone really concerned about privacy. IMSI I'm not so sure about.

The attack you specified is specific to phones with roaming enabled, and assumes that the user is so dumb they can't see the great big logo on their screen announcing which network they are connected to.

Which also leads to an interesting point, because if this system of theirs masquerades as an existing regular network, then there's all kind of entrapment defenses that could be used.

If they really needed a warrant to wiretap an area of London, they'd simply use that warrant at the network providers headquarters, who already has the equipment to do this. No ""secret suitcase"" required.

The article is still scaremongering, as it assumes the absolute extremes of what this technology is potentially able to do under certain circumstances and cellphone configurations, and presents it in a tone that implies EVERY one of thousands of users in that cell can have their phones ""tapped"" simultaneously and have all their communications recorded.

The chance is &lt; 1, and so we have less evidence that the student is as intelligent/capable as the state school student. Of course, if the private school student has gone on to achieve good results in optional national competitions and so on, that could be taken into account too.

The point could also be made that a student capable of getting straight As at a sink school should be capable of getting straight As *and* win gold in some national competitions etc... too at private school. If the student has failed to do this, then we should not rate them highly.

Not true. A function of grades and schooling would give a more *accurate* appraisal of students abilities. To turn the question around, why do you think we should use less accurate ways of measuring ability? Isn't that just a silly?

Technically, that could be any elected MP, but it would be very difficult for the leader of the largest party to maintain their position if they didn't ""command the respect of the House"" as well.

For example, Tony Blair resigned as Prime Minister, but didn't have to resign as leader of the Labour party. However, can you imagine the fuss if Gordon Brown hadn't taken both jobs!

If there were a breakdown in the House of Commons, then the Monarch, under advisement of the Privy Council can appoint whomever they want as Prime Minister.

Although the situation was narrowly avoided during the Abdication Crisis, it is generally thought that the Father of the House would get the job as an interim Prime Minister pending an immediate dissolution and general election.

The argument for why it is less unfair is as follows:

1. State school students are *as a group* more intelligent/capable/better able to get 1sts then private school students with equivalent grades *as a group*.

2. Given (1), a more accurate evaluation of students is given by considering both (i) Grades, and (ii) School type, then by considering grades alone, and by treating as 'better' students from state schools than students with equivalent results from private schools.

You haven't disagreed with (1), so I think you endorse (1). In any case, it has empirical support, is pretty obvious, and follows from basic reflection on the kind of education private schools deliver. (2) pretty much just follows from (1).

I think it was in the derby he had the most crosses out of anybody on the pitch but  only created one clear chance. Enrique had much less crosses but created more chances. 

Back to your original question, Johnson could learn a bit defensively from Kelly. Playing attacking full-backs you are always going to risk leaving yourself exposed but even when Johnson is in position he doesn't always make the right choice. So far I have been very happy with Enrique defensively. There have been one or two moments of miscommunication between him and Reina but apart from that he has been solid. 

When playing full-backs like those two you need your other defenders to step up and cover. This is where Carra struggles against fast attackers because they can beat him easily when he is that far up the pitch.

From their experiences and those of my dad working at Madras college, consistently one of the top state schools in Scotland, the difference in assistance they get is absolutely huge.

I fail to see how a system that fails to take into account such differences can be considered equitable - either to the state school pupils at lower schools who will still have pupils at other schools receiving more assistance than them, but without this being reflected in Universities' considerations, or to the private school pupils who see themselves being punished for doing exactly what those other pupils are doing - these are just children you know, not some toff-elite abusing the system for their own benefit.

If the system was designed around taking positive consideration of those in the less helpful schools then these issues would be resolved - pupils in less well resourced schools would still be being given extra credit against those in private schools, but also against pupils in those state schools that did give their pupils significantly more attention.  On top of this, pupils in well-off state schools wouldn't also being given that extra credit against private schools when said pupils are receiving exactly the same amount of assistance.

I don't know why you wouldn't see this as a fairer system - it is taking into account the actual practicalities of what is happening and trying to address them.

[Technically you don't have to be an MP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alec_Douglas-Home)
