Looks like you already have your answer.  

Pick one of your closest friends/acquaintances, take them to one side, tell them you've been a jerk by pretending to be something that you're not and ask them what they think you should do.  You can tell them it's because you're shy, scared, nervous, find it hard to make friends, don't like yourself, or whatever.

If anything it will strengthen your friendship because it demonstrates that you chose to trust them in your time of need.  Best possible case is that they'll say ""Oh yeah, we figured that out already"".  Worst possible case is that they'll go and tell everyone else.  But at least it saves you from having to do it.  Either way it will be a huge weight lifted off your shoulders.

Do it soon because the quicker you get it done, the quicker it will be over.

And apart from anything else, that's what a true Brit would do.  We're generally not too worried about making fools of ourselves and letting others have a laugh at our expense.  Self deprecation is an art form in the UK.

true,bowling4meth,english,Straight out of Surrey,"Right, I guess you've forced my hand here on this one. Clearly this devolved into a meta-discussion on whether I should respond with a long comment to a long comment, I agree that my response was flippant, but deliberately so. You've made assumptions based on interpretations of my prior comment that aren't correct. Good grief, I can't get a grip on how meta this all is, but hey. Please don't expect me to continue this discussion further, I don't have the energy or time to do so and it's clear that you're only interesting in projecting an idea that I'm somehow anti-NSS as a whole on the basis of my response to the actions of a small group of people.

Firstly, some background about me. I've spent years campaigning against Islamism in Istanbul at the hands of the Justice and Development Party (AKP). I've campaigned on behalf of Orthadox christian butchers in Istanbul to be able to sell pork produced in Turkey when AKP tried to remove the ability to renew licences to do so as a means of pushing Islamism. When Tayyip Erdogan was mayor of Istanbul, he tried to ban Alcohol and I went on marches through Taksim against this. In Turkey, Islamism and secularism are slightly different but much more prominent issues that have led to coups. I like to think I know a little about secularism and members of the NSS have been on marches with me.

I was born a catholic, but I don't consider myself a christian, nor muslim nor whatever. I'm comfortable with the UK as a moderately secularist country but in comparison to Turkey, the bulk of the UK's problems when it comes to religion pale into comparison. There are problems where secularists face very valid challenges (such as gay marriage) in this country. Comparatively speaking, parking is less of an issue.

Now that's me out of the way, I'll respond to your comment line by line. Please don't think that I'm trying to be flippant, it's just that in writing your earlier response there's no way I can be reasonably concise, and I just don't want to continue the discussion when I have better things to be getting on with - I won't change your mind, you won't change mine. The difference is that you're at best an armchair secularist and I've spent time in Turkish police cells for marching to protect secularism.

&gt; The work the NSS does is in ensuring everyone is treated the same regardless of personal, racial, sexual or religious differences. To that end, my statement stands.

No. The work the NSS does is that it promotes secularism. It's not trying to promote racial or sexual harmony, it's trying to remove religious advantage. From their website:

""The NSS works both in the UK and in Europe to combat the influence of religion on governments.""

This may be something that will be considered by some (i.e. secularists) as a reasonable cause and by the deeply religious as unreasonable, but it is not a campaign for sexual or racial harmony, except where sexual or racial harmony intersects with religious privilege.

&gt; Forgive my dismissal but this is looking at the situation in entirely the wrong way. It would be the equivalent of saying feminism is not about equality between the sexes because it removes the privileges that men enjoy: It is not protecting the interests of men who have a disproportionate level of power.

Feminism is not about sexual equality. Feminism is about promoting womens rights and does so without respect to promoting the male part of an equality agenda. Feminism by definition cannot promote the male part of sexual relations, to do so would go against the agenda. Before you decide to try and tear me apart bear in mind that in the late 60s and 70s I was a large supporter of the feminist movement. However there is no equivalent male movement beyond the mens' rights movement which has on occasion seen cause to be somewhat extreme or odious, something that does itself no favours.

&gt; Yes, obviously, but only if those religious rights are discriminatory. It is a common misconception, spread by religious people, that secularism will result in persecution of religious groups. That is not the case, unless the religious groups are being discriminatory, in which case the NSS will only work to stamp out those instances.

Again, I disagree here. The religious position is valid - they are being persecuted because of their privilege. Maybe you're just making a less than ideal choice of words and I apologise for the Internet pedantry, but Christian groups in the UK are being targeted and attacked by the NSS because of their religious privilege. I'm not entering into a discussion on the ethical elements of the actions of either party, but it is clear that the NSS is targeting religious privilege in the UK and by extension religious groups because of religious privilege. To make any claim to the contrary would be disingenuous.

&gt; You will have heard in the last few years about the ""secularist's war on Christianity"". Essentially the argument boils down to (some) Christians not wanting to comply with the equality laws i.e. in the main they do not want to give homosexuals the rights afforded to them by law. These people are basically saying: You are persecuting me by not allowing me to persecute.

The argument that it boils down to is correct. The NSS is persecuting the groups on the grounds of their religious privilege to discriminate. The NSS is persecuting the religious privilege of these groups, and by extension it's actions form a greater part of persecution of these groups themselves. It is possible to argue that the NSS is doing a good thing by removing religious privilege. There is a counter argument from such religious groups that they are protecting rights they have had for many years. Then again, we used to burn catholics and I don't see any religious groups campaigning for it's return.

You're falling into the logical trap of assuming that one side has the moral high ground. A hundred years ago the NSS would be shut down. A hundred years from now it may be, or it may be the church of england that's shut down. You may feel that the NSS does have the moral high ground, but the religious groups you refer to are more likely to feel the opposite, and that the NSS is attacking their way of life.

true,bowling4meth,english,Straight out of Surrey,"**EDIT:** I'm trying to respond to your comment but hit the length limit so had to split in two. Please read my other comment first otherwise this won't make any sense.

&gt; An analogy would be a racist crying foul because he is being made to treat a black person the same way he would treat a white person.

I would disagree here. What we're talking about is free parking for people to go to a church, not to go shopping. It just happens that the church is near a shopping centre. Most religious groups, especially the C of E promote the idea of treating people of all faiths equally. There is no equivalent of the gentile in the C of E, nor an infidel to be smited. I'm sure there's sections of the bible that talk about killing unbelievers, but I've yet to see a C of E vicar taken seriously if they promote anything other than love thy neighbour and all that. I'm not saying that all vicars, priests, rabbi's etc. are like this, but your point about race I feel is particularly invalid, when ""the christian thing to do"" is to love your neighbour, and especially when we're really talking about parking spots.

&gt; To rewrite your above sentence: ""They're representing multicultural interests, which do not automatically imply equality, but the removal of white rights.""

Please don't rewrite my sentences like that, it comes across like you're trying to imply that I'm a racist, or that you're a fringe nutter. I see where you're coming from but I fail to see how you can reasonably equate people looking to maintain free parking spaces with 'white rights'.

&gt; I'm not trying to imply you or anyone else is racist, but just demonstrating how that line of argumentation is flawed. 

Then you'll have to forgive me for taking the rewriting of my sentence as exactly that. You didn't need to rewrite my sentence and replace it with a racist remark, then link that to unidentified religious groups but you did. It's a form of ad hominem against me and against religious groups versus secularists. At no point was that line of argumentation made. Again, we're talking about parking spaces, not gay rights, not a pogrom.

&gt; But... the NSS does many things. This isn't the only thing they're doing. I've seen this mentality quite a bit recently about various topics recently: Just because they have a position concerning this particular issue doesn't mean they're not working elsewhere.

No, it just means that they're fighting the small battles while fighting the big ones. I get that. And should they prevail and churchgoers will have to pay to park outside a church for the purposes of going to church regardless of any possibility that the church may have organised a deal when planning permission was granted or any other factor, this will be an enormous victory for secularism, as big as the release of Orhan Pamuk when he was imprisoned for insulting Turkishness. It will be a victory for the people of Woking, no longer forced to look on as church go-ers go to church and park for free, we are all one under the glorious revolution, paying for parking spaces!

I'm sorry, that got a little out of hand. I understand that you're heavily invested in this personally, and I accept the NSS does many things and some of them good, but it seems to me that this (the parking space issue) isn't necessarily one of them.

&gt; Also the NSS is not simply a group of a few people in London. True they only have a handful of people who take a wage, but much of the research is done by members acting for no money all over the country. My own local group and others across the country have put in Freedom of Information requests and gathered statistics for large campaigns you will have heard of. Consider the Hospital Chaplains or the Transport for Schools campaigns: those two campaigns were conducted by only a few people, and the latter was carried on by two friends of mine acting alone. Not paid work, but completely voluntary in their own time.

It's nice that there's this group of people looking to protect secular rights. I don't have a problem with this.

&gt; Finally - Who decides what is important and what isn't? My own pet project at the moment is finding out whether or not Humanism and/or Secularism is being taught in schools on the RE Curriculum around the country. Is that important in the grand scheme of things? It depends on your view point. Personally I find that, with the number of faith run schools in the country being at 1 in 3 and RE is essentially what a school wants it to be, is that no core standard for RE is a bad thing. In many cases RE is teaching one particular religion rather than teaching about all religions, philosophies and world views. But when you compare it to religious privilege in government or the fact that (male) circumcision is still legal, it is a trivial matter. We can't all work on the big issues and it is very important that people take the smaller challenges too.

Fair enough, you have a cause and I accept that. I'm only writing this because I said I would respond earlier. I'm not actually sure what to write as I don't know much about the issue and it's obviously closer to your heart than mine, but it's good to have a cause I guess and to push for it.

Anyway, to conclude:

* You wrote a wall of text.
* I have now responded with a similar wall of text.
* It took a lot of my time to respond. 
* I made some points against your points, responding to points you made against mine.
* I doubt either position has changed.
* If you read it properly it probably took you a while to read
* I'm sure you have better things to do than write a piece by piece response

I'm sorry for making the wall of text comment. It was flippant and easily open to interpretation that I'm maybe attacking the verbosity of your comment instead of addressing your point, but three walls of text later and I don't think we're any nearer to reaching agreement.

Refer to women as clunge. All the time. Its the nicest thing you can say, american accents don't really work for us: you say stuff like ""hot"" and ""pretty"" we prefer clunge. If you're ever speaking to a well off/affluent girl she'll love it if you complement her by saying something like ""you really are top quality clunge aren't you?"".

- Talk about the weather too much. If you live in LA this may be hard to vary the conversation but if you are wanting to be truly British then you need to talk about the weather. Preferably wish for colder weather when it is hot and vice versa.
- Ensure you queue up correctly. A queue is a line in your terms. Never call it a line if you are British. A British person knows the exact order of who arrived at a queue (whether an actual 'line' like a bus stop or an informal queue like a bar). Never disobey the order. If someone jumps in front of you then you should be planning revenge.
- Recognise these accents (there is no such thing as a normal British accent): http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dABo_DCIdpM
- Consider purchasing this: http://www.amazon.co.uk/How-be-British-Collection/dp/0952287013

It is simply not possible to not afford their university fees. You probably want to save some money to add to their student loan to cover living expenses (rent, food, books etc.) but a few thousand pounds a year would be plenty for that. 

Of course you might want to help your child pay off their student loan so they leave university debt free, but it is by no means necessary (and could be said to be a stupid idea as the student loan is the cheapest debt you'll ever have, better to put the money in a savings account to use as a deposit towards a house or something).",0,1318928891,null,0,false,0,c2sefkj,t3_lf2w1,t1_c2sefkj,t1_c2s678m,1427747519,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

Overs - set of six deliveries, you change ends and bowlers after 6 balls, one over. 

Runs - the score, how many times you run between wickets. If you hit it hard enough to go to the edge of the field (marked by the Boundary rope ie. the Boundary.)  you get 4 without having to move, if you send it over the boundary rope - six runs. 

Wickets - the amount of men in your team who have batted and then gone out. Start a 0 ends at 10. If you have ten men out - your innings is over. It literally refers to the three sticks and bail at each end of the play area. 

Out - is when you do something game ending for the batsman. If the ball hits the wickets, if it is caught, if the opposing team hits a wicket while you run or if your leg prevents the ball from hitting the wicket that would have done otherwise. 

If the batsman is out, the team ""loses a wicket"". 

Innings - the amount of time a team spends bats

Thus the aim is to make as many *runs* as possible in your *innings*. The team with the highest score wins.

&gt; Thomas Luccin, a banker, added: ""Capitalism makes the world go around, to be honest. Look what happened with communism. There's always going to be greed in the world.""

Dear Thomas, Here is the thing - its not capitalism that we have now, real capitalism would have allowed your employer to fail and close as a direct consequence of its flawed business model that took on to much risk. That Thomas,  is the essence of true capitalism!

It goes deeper then that too you see, your whole business is based on perpetual growth of companies or their failure. So, due to this we now end up with situations where a company makes 2.3 billion profit, but that profit does not meet expected growth forecasts so they lose value in your realm and so said company starts to restructure by axing thousand of jobs,  closing manufacturing plants and regional offices, even though the core business is sound and making profit!

You're also geared to follow human emotions whereby fear and greed can dictate the whole dynamics of the economy and you know what? This does not work so well for us who need to rely on stability to be able to provide for ourselves and our families.

The fact is that business can function and exist without out your dysfunctional model. Its broke mate and we need to find a way to let it demise without taking the rest of the world down with it. Then we can get on with making business without you, business based on sound principles of profit being enough and not perpetual growth in a world needing to learn to conserve and........here is the thing....be **'economical'** :)

And when you're bored of having a dog, you can kick it out of the house and stop feeding it, and it'll leave.

The Doctor doesn't give people all of space and time. He gives them the adventures he feels like going on for as long as he feels like, and then he drops them back on Earth when that gets boring. And once you're back on Earth, you don't have all of space and time: you have your own memories of adventure and a boring, unfulfilling life until you die. 

The Doctor is a mean man. He uses an inescapable bait to lure whomever he fancies into his box, hangs out with them while doing good things until he gets bored, and then drops them back on Earth so that they can go tell others how great he is. Saving the world is a vanity project he's created so he can feel better about the fact that he's basically just a thief and a liar.

true,db1000c,uk,United Kingdom,"http://www.ucas.com/students/wheretostart/nonukstudents/

this is where i would recommend you start if you are wanting to study in the UK, the system is very welcoming of international students, and seeing as how you are technically a British citizen, you should have no problem. In terms of good universities for International Relations in the UK, the top ones are LSE, Durham, Birmingham, Bradford (its an international hub for Peace Studies), Edinburgh and Manchester. Obviously there is Oxbridge, but I don't know your qualification history, however you seem like a smart person so I'm sure it could be an option for you :)

All the universities I've listed are in quite nice places in the UK, obviously every city has its downsides, but students tend to live in relative comfort.

The weather isn't great. And sometimes it can feel a bit depressing living here, but it is the 26th most liveable country in the world and so does have some good points. The culture is not too difficult to adjust too and your time in the USA will make it feel quite familiar. 

There was a settlement Act in 1946, whereby anyone from the colonies could settle in the UK, no questions asked. However, please don't come here with no plan as you will find yourself in a mess. Housing is expensive and the waiting lists for council housing is long. You can rent, of course, but with no plan the urgency will likely lead to you settling in somewhere horrible, my recommendation is for you to try and live on campus at a university for the initial period as students have an easier time finding rental property. 

One last point, don't move here until next August/September as that is when enrolment for universities is, and you will have somewhere to live.

The way i personally would do it is getting the First Capital Connect from Luton Airport Parkway to East Croydon, then a train from there to Portsmouth Harbour.

The Brits have peculiar words for many things. Money is referred to as
""goolies"" in slang, so you should for instance say ""I'd love 
to come to the pub but I haven't got any goolies.""
""Quid"" is the modern word for what was once called a ""shilling"" (the equivalent of seventeen cents American).
 
**MAKING FRIENDS**

If you are fond of someone, you should tell him he is a ""great tosser"" - he will be touched. The English are a notoriously tactile, demonstrative people, and if you want to fit in you should hold hands with your acquaintances and tossers when you walk down the street.
 
**CUSTOMS**

Ever since their Labour government wholeheartedly embraced full union with Europe, the Brits have been attempting to adopt certain continental customs, such as the large midday meal followed by a two- or three-hour siesta, which they call a ""wank"". As this is still a fairly new practice in Britain, it is not uncommon for people to oversleep (alarm clocks, alas, do not work there because of the magnetic pull from Greenwich). If you are late for supper, simply apologise and explain that you were having a wank -- everyone will understand and forgive you.

You can't disagree like that though, freedom of speech is absolute, binary. Either you believe in freedom of speech or you don't. As soon as someone other than the individual starts to limit what you can express (through speech, writing, whatever) you no longer have that freedom, you have a set of permissible things and a set of impermissible things.

You're arguing that freedom of expression can not *exist*, not that it can not be completely free. I simply disagree.

Galileo was placed under house arrest for life by the catholic church because he professed beliefs that they deemed too dangerous, too heretical, and too evil to even think. Socrates was (effectively) put to death because he dared to suggest that the system of government which existed in Athens at the time wasn't the best one - his speech was deemed dangerous, rabble rousing.

Authorities around the world, for the entirety of human history, have banned speech on grounds that it's dangerous, it's heretical, it's discriminatory, and many other reasons. They limited free speech, to limit freedom.

Also on top of this I'd add that to deal with the moral hazards caused by the bail outs. All future bail outs should be in the form of pure expropriation by government. If you fail and threaten the stability of the economy the shareholders should suffer first (no I don't care that many of those shareholders are pension funds). The situation post bail out is even more dangerous than the situation before. At least the banks had the threat of failure and bankruptcy then. Banks may be too big to fail but that doesn't mean the shareholders need to benefit from that situation.

Ironically, this is a capitalist response, but apparently capitalists dislike socialism except when it benefits them. This won't make the pain go away, of course, but it will remove the rot once and for all.

* Introduce a cap on directors salaries, possibly in the form of a maximum allowed salary as a multiple of average employee salary.

* Introduce a cap on bonuses, possibly in the form of a maximum allowed bonus as a multiple of company profits.

* Ensure all companies over 100 employees have at least one employee representative on the board. Far from holding the company back, this will ensure there is some one on the board who actually knows how to use a CNC mill, write C++ or bake bread or whatever it is they do. Most employees are rather keen for their employer to succeed, so this may even make businesses more competitive. Germany has a similar law, and it has worked very well over there, in my opinion.

* Get serious on tax evasion. The average bloke on the street looks at the likes of Vodafone taking the piss with their tax bill and wonders whether they should 'go Greek' on the whole thing too.

These policies aren't so much about fixing the problem (the problem, in my opinion, is un-fixable), but rather spreading the pain more fairly and redressing the imbalance between the rich 1% and the rest of us.

What? Our ways were completely different. TC made a statement, you dismissed it as an opinion that doesn't invalidate yours. I didn't express an opinion--your opinion actually was misguided and misplaced because you took a joke seriously. That you found it to be an opinion just further shows that you have no idea what an opinion *is*. Furthermore, there is absolutely nothing wrong with having an opinion on an opinion. They don't cancel out like identical soundwaves.

&gt;It seemed kind of counterproductive.

To what?

&gt;If I threw up a ""DISCLAIMER, I'M ABOUT TO GENERALIZE ETC ETC"" in my original post would that soothe people's feelings?

Probably not considering your generalizations were more in your second post.

If you do so, you can extract the bits you want to keep (via a temporary nationalization) while letting the rest go bust.

Point 2, I'm not so sure about. I can see why it's needed, but I'd far rather let them earn what they want but make it far harder to avoid paying taxes on it. 

Point 3, I would rather bonuses were made a long term thing, so you get a bonus based on what you did over 5 years rather than what you did over the course of a year. Ideally to encourage long term planning, rather than allowing people to make a quick buck and move on before it fails.

Point 4 is a very good idea. A lot of places have works councils and the like, but they just seem to report to the board rather than actually be part of the board. I would want to see this done sans unions though, they are their own set of problems.

true,widgetas,null,null,"&gt; will have been there long before the council started charging people for parking

You can say that about *anything* including the shops! If you've looked to see where these churches are, it's not like the parking was already there for the congregation to use - I would imagine that the massive multistory in the middle of the town (and in between two of the churches) is the parking in question. But who is providing the land on which we all want to park? The council. If it wasn't the church property in the first place, why does it matter that the church could have been there first? Surely the congregation would have parked elsewhere.

&gt; it would probably have meant the end of their church

Meanwhile thousands of other churches around the country have congregations that pay for parking. If attendees can fork out a bit of cash each week for a collection, then the parking fee won't be breaking the bank.

&gt;  I imagine an organisation like the NSS would be rubbing its hands with glee at such a prospect.

From that I get the impression you don't understand what the NSS stands for or have been listening to people who aren't fans of theirs. I've said it several times in this thread: The NSS wants everyone to be treated equally regardless of sex, race, sexuality, skin colour or religion. They/we do not want to see religious institutions closed down and in the recent past the NSS has been involved or spoken publicly on numerous occasions taking the side of religious people/groups who are being oppressed by bigger/stronger religion in some way. Secularism is not atheism nor anti-theism, nor does secularism say anything about the removal or destroying of religions.

&gt; It's an easy target because it's easy to persuade a council to ignore the wishes of a bunch of pensioners. There's no political organisation fighting for their rights.

Again this has nothing to do with rights, rather this is about the current unfair treatment: privilege being afforded for no good reason. They - the congregation of *three* churches not even just 'a bunch of pensioners' - are getting special treatment while everyone else has to pay *simply* because they go to a church. That's not on. By the way if you take a look at the churches' websites, you'll see that they aren't just pensioners. For example from one of them: ""· Thriving– over 800 adults, teenagers and children"" while the others speak of the youngsters in their congregations too.

&gt; The CofE certainly won't.

Are you joking? The reason the Church has the exemption in the first place is because they made a plea to the council. How many other groups do you think would even get to do that? Choose any council anywhere in the country: I will put money on there being a councillor who is either sympathetic to one particular local religious group, a member of a congregation or even is a personal friend of a local religious official. Add to that the example I gave elsewhere in this thread where the Bishop of Westminster (and others) lobbied Westminster Council to allow free parking for local churches on Sunday a couple of months ago (but quite rightly failed)... and that there are 26 Bishops in the House of Lords who will vote in a very particular way guaranteed... Yeah the CoE is very hard done by and have no religious influence at all these days. /sarcasm",0,1318944389,null,0,false,0,c2sfbpm,t3_lewal,t1_c2sfbpm,t1_c2sei5n,1427747939,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

true,DogBotherer,null,null,"&gt;You mean the threat of violence between nations?

As a backstop, yes, but there are obviously various forms of soft power and economic coercion too.

&gt;Even if you wanted it how do you eliminate capitalism.  People can still speculate without the existence of money.

First, let's be clear what I'm talking about when I refer to capitalism, hopefully without getting into a protracted, distracting and ultimately irrelevant debate about ahistorical dictionary definitions - not because I particularly want to unfairly fame the debate, but because it's not really important in the sense that if you don't agree what I'm describing is your definition of capitalism then it may well be that your definition of capitalism is not what I'm against, and we might actually agree that what I'm describing is something we both want to see gone.  Capitalism to left-leaning libertarians/anarchists is the system of State-enforced monopolies and privileges which enables a small proportion of people to acquire a disproportionate amount of the wealth.  As I said above, the antithesis of the free(d) market.  Some (social) anarchists go further, seeing the market itself as hierarchical and oppressive and a force which will inevitably lead back to capitalism, but I'm not one of these.

So, with the above definition in hand, how do you eliminate capitalism?  The pat answer is by eliminating the State, because without the State the monopolies and privileges of capitalism can't be enforced.  

You note that people can still speculate without the existence of money, but in fact, mutualists generally aren't looking for an end to money as such (syndicalists and communists generally are), on the contrary, they want a free market in money rather than a State or banking monopoly currency.  I think I pointed you to Tucker's four monopolies before, and one of these is [money](http://uncletaz.com/liberty/money.html) (the others being land, patents and tariffs).  Tucker is very strong on the idea of free money (free as in freedom, not beer), and his ideas, whilst dated still bear close scrutiny.  Ending the prohibitions and restraints on and allowing these sorts of systems to flourish alongside capitalism would be one approach to undermining it.  Anarchism is, by its nature, a revolutionary screed, but most conceptions of it since the discrediting of the bomb throwers and assassins of its 'propaganda of the deed' days (who were probably mostly agents provocateurs anyway) aren't big proponents of blood and fire revolutions.  Mostly they want to hack away at the roots or hollow out the State just leaving a shell which can eventually crumble away.

It's difficult to give a sensible and detailed response to such a big question as how do you eliminate capitalism but I quite like the central idea contained in [this post](http://howtosavetheworld.ca/2005/02/18/all-about-power-and-the-three-ways-to-topple-it-part-1/).",0,1318946995,null,0,false,0,c2sflln,t3_ld3mt,t1_c2sflln,t1_c2sezrt,1427748068,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

It's easy to support a law like that ""for health reasons"", but it's only one of the more obvious examples - how are our opinions affected by government-sponsored messages that we're not even aware of?

true,pegothejerk,tardis,TARDIS,"I'm posting an update in /r/doctorwho because, well, frankly 95% of the purchases came from here and you guys rock.  

Two weeks ago, or something (I'm not slept a whole lot this week) a redditor messaged me out of the blue and asked if I could figure out how to make a functional pocket watch in the stylings of our favorite time lord. I said I'd give it a shot.  Two weeks later I am still getting orders for these crazy little things and I couldn't be happier to be doing something I love for my favorite sub-group of my favorite community.  Here's where I'm at in this whole process - 

- I've received around a dozen pre-pays at the moment with others trickling in.

- I had by chance ordered more materials to ""play"" with last week, enough that I have three finished as of this morning, those will ship today (with one exception, one is black, I have to find a pre-order person who wants that one).

- I only have the one black clock.  it was intended for just some random experimentation in the future, but I have added it into one of these.  I have offered it to the first person in line, and he has until noon central time today to ask for it.  If he doesn't the first pre-paid order to say they want it gets it.  If none of them want it, someone else can buy it.  All clocks ordered, otherwise, have been blue.  The rest will be blue, at least until I have made a great deal of the second batch.  At that point I will start making custom pieces for people, should they so desire. **(update: the black one has been made available to which ever pre-paid wants it)**

- I ordered more materials Friday and a lot of them have come in, so 6 more watches will be finished by tomorrow afternoonish.  

- I'm seriously lacking in 3 things: chain, lobster clasp, and the pocket watch cases.  I am and have been ordering and hunting those down ever since this started, so pieces sort of trickle in to me day by day.  The rest of the materials, especially what I use to modify the watch parts and case, are hand made by me, so I can knock those out whenever I need.

- I have around 15 people who expressed interest in buying watches when the second batch is made and listed to my etsy shop.  I still plan on making those, those parts have been ordered as well.  I imagine I'll get to finishing the last pre-orders at the end of this week or beginning of next.  That means the second batch will be built next week.  I will contact everyone who was in communications with me about that, do not worry.

Now that you know where I'm at generally, let me speak personally, if I may.  I am so blown away that there is a tremendous amount of interest in anything I'm making.  Upvotes are one thing, but actual sales are another.  I'm not used to this, but I am having so much fun building these.  It's a labor of love.  Do understand, however, that a great deal of these are made or modified by hand.  It is an artistic piece, and as such it does take some time.  It doesn't take THAT long, thankfully, but with the great number of orders, I (for the first time in my artistic career) have a huge waiting line of people telling me to shut up and take their money and that means I need to ask some of you for a tiny bit of patience.  I am sending these out in the order in which they were paid for, so please be understanding of that.  Also know that I'm doing everything I can to bust these out, and that means working most of the day, most days.  I want everyone who wants one to have one, and I will keep building them until that achievement is unlocked.  

Finally, thank you, from the bottom of my heart, everyone, for giving me the opportunity to do something amazing for the community and with my time.  I've always been an artist, but being a paid artist is another story.  You have made me extremely happy, and I'm doing my best to return the favor.  Please, feel free to message me with any questions, concerns, or advice.

You might say the same about understanding his relationship with the Daleks and watching all of the old episodes. Yes, you get a fuller picture, but not seeing them doesn't give you an impartial understanding, just a less perfect one.

I picked the End of Time simply because it was the top rated episode on iTunes at the time.

It was really the spirit of the Doctor that got me interested in the series, and since I had started with a special, I figured I'd go back and watch some more conventional episodes, bringing me to ""The Girl in the Fireplace"" and ""The Age of Steel"", eventually bringing me back to ""Rose"", and I just continued from there.

Yes, we absolutely are.  Something I never considered (since the Doctor always talked about being surprised at this or that quality in a new regeneration, like being disappointed at not being ginger) is that the Doctor might be able to deliberately cultivate traits in a regeneration.  I wonder because River said she was focusing on a dress size and seemed pleased with the result.  She might have been kidding, but if not then that means the Tenth might have been able to determine a quality or two in the Eleventh.

If so, I think if anything he'd be responsible for Eleven's humility.  Eleven's self-image seems a lot more grounded, though at the expense of being more negative overall.  I wonder if the Doctor didn't see how his ego had gone so wrong and, in his final moment as he was, try to prevent it from happening again.

Of course, I'm reminded of a line Gaiman wrote.  'The price of getting what you want is getting what you once wanted.'  The way people with strict parents say their parents screwed them up by being too strict and people with lax parents say their parents screwed them up by being too lax, the moral is that *we're always screwed up no matter what*.  

Maybe that's the lesson we're being shown with the Doctor.  Think too much of yourself, think too little of yourself, either way there's going to be trouble.  Even if you have the power to change who you are at a fundamental level, it's still all determined by how you handle things in the here and now.",0,1318961674,null,0,false,0,c2shq02,t3_lg3ek,t1_c2shq02,t1_c2shm0a,1427749069,2,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,2

The other way it could be her 'birthday' is if the boys have been hopping through time/space, but the date Rory shows up at the stormcage really is the same date (including year) that Melody is born.  If that was the case then I think River would have acted differently.  As it was, she didn't seem to realize the Doctor was due for Demon's Run until she looked at her diary.  You could still make your theory work a few ways (the easiest of which being 'River lies'), but my vote still goes to right day, wrong year. ie, they hopped x years forward/backward and coincidentally came to recruit her on her birthday.

IMO, the purpose of the birthday remark is just to give us a picture of River in her cell, going on once a year birthday dates with her Doctor... they've implied before that he shows up now and then to take her on dates, and I suspect these occasional references are the writers' way of satisfying fan curiosity without having to actually show them dating.",0,1318964718,null,0,false,0,c2si7oi,t3_lgca4,t1_c2si7oi,t1_c2sgzu0,1427749308,5,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,5

Doomsday is for the same reason as you.  I was a sobbing mess at the end and for a little while afterward.  
Turn Left absolutely wrecked me the second time around because I knew what was going to happen to Donna.  She's the reason that Journey's End was emotional torture for me.  I mean, my heart broke for the Doctor when he had to leave Rose again, but his and Donna's loss was heart wrenching. I pretty much just curled up in a ball and cried after the episode ended.  Wilf's words to the Doctor haunted me.
The End of Time part 2 made me cry because David was leaving and because I just felt so awful for Ten.  It's like he had just broken in many ways.  
Finally, Vincent and the Doctor was just incredibly sad but beautiful for many reasons.  I liked the way it dealt with depression and the Doctor's line about the good and bad things in life.  
Overall, I might have to give the ""makes-me-cry-like-a-child"" award to Journey's End.

Watched that on PBS when they where still showing re-runs of the Classic Series, but that wasn't what got me into Doctor Who. I didn't watch it much because, as a kid, I didn't get it. Then, the winter of 2009 came about. We had gotten Netflix earlier that year and I had added the first series of Doctor Who shortly afterwards, where it sat with all of the other television shows I wanted to watch but never quite had the time for. One night, the entire family was sitting in the living room watching a movie. When we finished, we browsed through the queue and came upon Doctor Who. My dad had followed the show on PBS much more than I did and so we decided to watch it. After watching Rose, we were hooked.

On a side note, I was really pissed when I found out that I basically missed all of David Tennant's career, coming in on his coattails and following Matt Smith.

true,stop___grammar_time,tardis,TARDIS,"What exactly are you trying to achieve? Just a large Tardis on your door? a Tardis facade that covers the interior side? What's your budget? I don't see this costing more than $20-$30 at the most unless you are going for the plywood option. Personally, I'd go foam core/poster board.

I can't speak for where you live, but around my area poster board's only $1-2 for a 3x4' sheet, and foam core's only about $1-4, depending on thickness up to that size. I've found that craft stores tend to be a bit pricer for them. I'd recommend trying an office supply store, or even  the office supply/school supply section of your local large chain retailer.  I'd estimate 3-5 sheets depending on the size of your door, with 1 extra in case you mess up.  Stock white is usually the cheapest, occasionally you'll find a ""recycled"" brand for cheaper.

One can of spray paint, will probably run you $1-2. I don't see needing any more than the cheap stuff, since you said that it was temporary and going to be inside. Alternatively, you may be able to  *procure* some leftover paint in the proper color from your props department.  You might even be able to procure some leftover board/foam core there too from props/promotional stuff.

Then you'll need cutting stuff. Scissors for poster board, razor for foam core. Don't use scissors on it or you'll get nasty edges. I'd recommend an x-acto/scalpel type blade, but a utility knife will work fine too. Use a straight edge when you're cutting with a knife, and remember to put something underneath so you don't cut through to the floor/table whatever. 

As for mounting it, this method would be light enough to mount with just loops of regular tape. Or, you could buy mounting tape, which is this double-sided foam tape.

true,Generallysceptical,scot-Aberdeen,"The frozen, godless, north","One of the fundamental issues is that the IT skills of the average end user in the NHS hasn't changed since the 80s.  I imagine it's not terribly motivating to work at a help desk to know you can't even ask the user if things are plugged in, because that person would not know there is a difference between a power cable and any other wire coming out of equipment.  This leads to a ridiculously low level of expectation of hardware, because there aren't enough people to hold the average NHS workers hand all the time.  There is a culture that the end user can't use any initiative when encountering minor tech issues, that it is easier just to log a fault. As an example, a desktop can remained locked for weeks (if it times out after user walks away), because people are not empowered to deprive the beast of electricity and simply reboot. 

With this level of ineptitude, you can imagine how difficult it is to get people to adopt to actual systems. There exists a status quo of inadequacy, but any change in IT for the end user requires such enormous effort I can imagine it hardly seems worth it.  Couple this with the tendency for crap clinical staff to be pushed into management, in the hope they won't be crap at that as well.  Poor people with poor insight into how things could be on the ground in charge of implementing service design do not make for great clients, I imagine.  It's no surprise people can survive in IT despite not being fit for a similar private sector position, because or expectation of what can be achieved is so low.

true,rougecathy,eng-yorkshire,Yorkshire (in exile in Surrey),"It's been too long since my degree for me to remember much (I always was rubbish at remembering cases anyway), but IMO the three most important branches of law to know about are criminal, contract and the tort of negligence.
For criminal law you need to understand actus reus and mens rea.  For contract law you need to understand offer, acceptance and intention to create legal relations.  For negligence you are looking at duty of care, breach of that duty and causation (these are not literally the only things you need to know, but are the concepts that are important, interesting and not necessarily obvious, so IMO worth reading about).
It's worth reading around the cases, just reading the judgements will not help you understand what's so important about the cases.  A warning - the exciting cases with exciting facts aren't generally the ones that set a precedent!
I deal pretty much exclusively with employment law now, even for that it would be hard to recommend just a handful of cases as it depends on which bit of employment law you are interested in, but if you were to only read one it'd probably have to be [Ready Mixed Concrete] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ready_Mixed_Concrete_\(South_East\)_Ltd_v_Minister_of_Pensions_and_National_Insurance) which defines how to work out who is an employee rather than self employed.
Have fun, and remember you can go and observe at most courts and tribunals to see the law in action (99% of the time it's super-mundane, but still worth it to get an idea of what really goes on).",0,1318975536,null,0,false,0,c2sjw7h,t3_lgbsq,t1_c2sjw7h,t3_lgbsq,1427750161,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

The NHS is years behind many other industries in realising the importance of the interaction of systems and personal factors in creating the situation where errors occur. 

There is interesting information in the [actual report this is based on](http://www.midstaffspublicinquiry.com/sites/default/files/uploads/Dr_David_Rosser_paper.pdf), which can be found on the [official Mid staffordshire enquiry website](http://www.midstaffspublicinquiry.com/inquiry-seminars/information).  There does seem to be improving trends in a variety of areas after the introduction of this system and the full report shows a glimmer of interesting data, but it doesn't explain how things worked *before* the system came in *i.e* what actually changed.  I can see a lot of potential clinical utility and benefit from this system **however** here are some selected highlights,

&gt;""UHB would like to declare an interest as PICS is now commercially available via a private partner, CSE Global.""


&gt;""As there is no control arm it is not scientifically possible to state that this fall in mortality is related to the error reduction strategy.""


&gt;""It should be reiterated that there is no scientific evidence that this reduction could be reproduced, albeit no reasons obvious to us why not.""


&gt;""At UHB we have seen a significant reduction in errors temporally associated with a reduction in mortality, although few, if any, of the sort of errors which have been prevented would have directly caused death. We can no more identify those 100 patients per year whose deaths appear to have been avoided at UHB than we can the potentially avoidable deaths at Mid Staffs.""

No sense wasting money on a terrible newspaper 6 days out of 7 (which is a shame because I like to read a proper newspaper rather than a LCD screen). There's no consistency with any British newspaper.


My family buys a selection of tabloids and there is absolutely nothing of value in any of them... anybody with their eyes open knows they are not really newspapers, but for the vast majority of the population they are seen as a reliable source of news. The vast majority of middle/working class people in the UK will only get their news from the Metro/other tabloid and BBC/ITV news (which are little more than a live action tabloids), so I'm not surprised we're in such a mess.

* TARDIS lands in London 1851

* Doc 10 meets a girl shouting for ""The Doctor"" after discovering a ""Cybershade"" 

* 10 finds the girl, she doesn't know him but another person calling himself ""The Doctor"" appears

* 10 thinks it's a future incarnation

* Future Doc says to 10 people have been disappearing, he's trying to help but he has amnesia hence why he doesn't recognise 10

* Future Doc and 10 find Cybermen info stamps... turns out Future Doc was attacked by the Cybermen and one of these info stamps had all the info the Cybermen had about the Doctor. 

* After examing the info stamps, Doc 10 comes to realise that the Future Doc is really a human, Jackson Lake, one of the missing persons

* Doc 10 suspects that Jackson had encountered the Cybermen and used the infostamps containing knowledge of the Doctor to ward them off, with the side effect of infusing his mind with knowledge of the Doctor

* Doc 10 and Rosita (Future Doc's companion) enter an underground complex to find numerous children, pulled from workhouses around the city, at work under Cybermen guard. They encounter the bitter Miss Mercy Hartigan, the Cybermen's human ally that has brought the children to them for labour. The Doctor attempts to use a modified infostamp to overload the Cyberman's systems, but they instead repair it and identify the Doctor as their long-time foe, and prepare to ""delete"" him and Rosita. Jackson suddenly arrives, armed with several more infostamps which he uses to distract the Cybermen long enough for the three to escape. The Cybermen turn on Miss Hartigan, converting her into the controller for the ""Cyberking"", a giant mechanical Cyberman powered by the energy generated by the children.

* Jackson explains to the Doctor he has started recovering his memories, and remembers encountering the Cybermen on moving into his new home. The Doctor considers that Jackson's home may be near the Cyberman base, and, there, discovers a second entrance into the Cyberman base. Inside, as the Cyberking starts to rise to the city, the three rescue the children, including Jackson's son who was abducted in the initial attack and caused Jackson's fugue state. As the Cyberking starts to lay waste to the city, the Doctor uses Jackson's balloon to rise near the level of the Cyberking's control room, and tries to reason with Miss Hartigan, offering to take her and the Cybermen to a new planet. When she refuses, the Doctor uses the infostamps to severe her connection to the Cyberking, exposing her to the raw emotion of what she has done. The emotional feedback causes the other Cybermen to overload, and the Cyberking to start to topple. The Doctor uses the Dimensional Vault to draw the Cyberking and the remnants of the Cybermen into the Time Vortex, saving London.

Totally agree. At school it seemed for some of my friends (with money to afford video phones back then) some sort of competition for savagery. Some shit I was forcibly shown I found weird, and fucked up, but not 3 years in jail worthy... 

If people get off on seeing women shitting and pissing in people's faces so be it, as long as it is consensual? - This could also come under 'serious injury' because I'm sure eating and drink matter that has left the body cannot be good for you. 

I find pornography politics very interesting. I stumbled across a case brought against someone for making videos in america depicting having sex with 'under aged' girls. However I'm quite sure all were of legal age - yet he is serving a sentence over in America because some people (maybe in high up places) didn't like the 'fantasy' being portrayed. This to me is a very tricky area. But can the state dictate where fantasies, that remain just fantasies, have to stop? 

Within film I see very little restriction, except for your very good example, of films getting banned. The same thoughts follow through with computer games; Manhunt 2 I believe was banned. Yet you can still get GTA's where you can go around fucking people up.

Deliberate is kind of skeevy, but unintentionally-yet-deliberately becoming someone she could fall in love with is damned romantic.  It reminds me of Nicholson's line in *As Good As It Gets*; 'you make me want to be a better man.'

Indeed, that'd be an amusing explanation for why he didn't become ginger, and why it was so frustrating; he *tried* to become ginger, but his unconscious decisions soaked up all of his 'bandwidth' and didn't leave any room for deliberate aesthetics.

capital punishment wouldnt do a damn thing...,personally i don't believe in the death penalty or national service. 

1- on the death penalty i believe that life isnt worth taking no matter what ""justice"" it would serve, life in prison is all ways the answer to the worst  crimes, and yes its very easy for people to waggle their finger and say ""OH NO...THATS A SOFT ATTITUDE...HANG THE BASTARDS!! NON OF THIS LEFTY RUBBISH..LET EM GET WHAT THEY DESERVE"" now...my response to that is...isnt it a bit one track minded and sadistic that death is the only form of justice.. i mean, if thats their logic...whats stopping us all stepping back in time and having public hanging to get our kicks! infact instead of match of the day we can have an INTERACTIVE TV programme where we can all press the red button to choose what death some mentally disabled teen with snot on his prison sleeves can have...Oh yes...sit round with tea, gran in her arm chair INSISTING we press the yellow button for electrocution.. davina comes out beaming from ear to ear on our screens as the camera pans past her plastic physeek as the hood is placed over the teens head whilst he weeps...just for justice (good title if ITV are reading) and as soon as the votes are in..BAM hes dead before we have finished our chicken and chips. -___- now obviously thats a huge exaggeration but capital punishment is just old fashioned and human life shouldnt be singled out into ""they can die for this but not for that""


2- National Service... 

right, well.....it just wouldnt happen these days...SAY for example it was brought in...and the police or whoever had to round up teens between 13-19 and force them into a ""dads army"" like role....no chance..our generation would give you two fingers and fuck off...it wouldn't happen... it worked in the 50s as there was fuck all to do for teens until the god send Rock N Roll came along(tah very much chuck berry) , ALONG WITH material goods and pleasures people could BUY like television...people could afford to SPEND money on each other after the war. There was no need in throwing teens into a military esque roll as the war was over and teens had more opportunities!! 

now its got the point where teens are so ""independent"" (and i use that word carefully) that it wouldnt fucking work. Your more likely to find a teen without grease upon there face than one willing to join national service..you old farts.

If anything it's more so than the previous incarnation, your opinion is your opinion, but saying you don't like him because he doesn't fit in is just incorrect.

Now each nation state should accomodate these people and not try to stamp out such behaviour because it's inconvenient to the majority (which it is, undoubtedly). So, sites should be set aside for them, to move from one place to another.

I think the argument here is, and the UN got involved on the same point, is that the UK government hasn't provided a reasonable number of site for the travellers to pitch on. In fact there's an opinion that the sites were deliberately reduced done by the Thatcher government, but I'm not commenting on that.

So the whole point is that they've been prevented from moving from one place to another. Thereafter, when they buy land and settle on it, they're refused planning permission (on half of it), even though it used to be a scrap heap.

For your analogy to be accurate, you'd have to let the person stay in your room for ten years and subsidise their legal costs while the matter was pursued exhaustively through the courts. Punching would only commence after every avenue was explored and only with the explicit permission of the law and under strict conditions designed to avoid unnecessary harm.

&gt; Perhaps I'm too utilitarian for my own good, but weighing up what's lost and what's gained from the eviction, I don't really see the gain in it.

It's very simple. One of the principles of the rule of law is that it is applied to everyone equally. To allow the Dale Farm travellers to stay after it has been clearly and finally demonstrated (no-one could claim they've not received fair hearing) that they have broken the law would mean that there was one law for travellers, and one law for everyone else. It brings the law into disrepute, inflames tensions and starts to unpick one of the fundamental unifying principles of our democratic society.

If you are a utilitarian and truly believe that the greatest good of the greatest number is the chief ethical consideration, then I can't see how you could place the interests of a small number of people who have broken the law above the vast majority of the UK population who have a right to live in a democracy where the rule of law is respected and enforced.

true,loudribs,eng-yorkshire,2 'E's and some 'LSD',"Ok, I'll do my best here.

1) Sectioning usually involves being assessed by one of a number of mental health professional and it requires three people to sign off it. These can be a psychiatrist, the GP, a social worker with the relevent qualifications (AMHP) and/or a family member. Initally you are usually given a Section 2 and this allows you to be detained in a mental health unit for the purposes of assessment. If that assessment concludes that you are very unwell and a danger to yourself/others you can be put on a Section 3 which requires you to accept treatment and runs for up to six months (upon which it can be renewed). You can also be temporaily sectioned under the likes of Section 136 which allows people like the police to take you to 'a place of safety' (usually a cell at the local nick). However, it is usually a highly distressing process for all involved.

2) Yes, by it's very nature, sectioning tends to happen against people's will. The big tests are a) are they a danger to themselves or others, b) do they have insight (i.e. are they so mad they don't know they are mad) and c) are they intoxicated? If they are, they will have to sober up before a sectioning can take place. As for your mum, no, I don't think she's crazy enough. Yes, her behaviour is odd/weird and yes, it's probably not the best for both herself and you but it doesn't represent a clear threat to life and limb and she does appear to have some insight. Add into that that most mental health units are bursting at the seams and you'll find that the bar is now very high for sectioning.

3) You and your brother should be fine to continue living in your house and the local authority should continue to pay HB if she were sectioned.

4) No, it's not the only option but you are in a difficult position as your mother doesn't seem to want help. She has to be the one who approaches services so you're best off trying to encourage her to ask her GP for a referral to a Community Mental Health Team. However, there is one more option. Give your local council's Adult Social Care team a call, ask to speak to the Duty Worker and explain the situation. They may or may not decide to follow it up.

5) Just be aware that Sectioning really is a last resort and should only be used when there's clear and present danger. Being on a ward sucks and doesn't do people much good. It's keeps them safe, but that's about the limit of it (and can make things worse). It's also a shitty process that no-one enjoys. Trust me, I've been a part of many sectionings and it never gets any better.

* setup the thomson in [bridge mode](http://beusergroup.co.uk/technotes/index.php?title=How_to_put_the_BEBox_into_Bridge_Mode), basically forward all internet traffic directly to the new router, and let the new router handle all routing and wireless.

That it didn't happen is why we don't have Gelth running around in Aliens of London, but it still could have happened.

What party is the most polarising, for example would most people who have traditionally voted Labour be more likely to never vote Conservative than they would never vote Lib Dem out of principle, even though New Labour had far more in common with the Tories than traditional Lib Dem platforms?  We know as observable fact, whether you agree with them or you don't, in an AV vote some people would effectively vote anything but Tory, currently the most popular party.  

It essentially argues a vote of not who people think will be best elected into government, but a vote of who they don't want.  That's sinister.

Added to that the Lib Dems even said they wanted much fewer constituencies.  That makes for less representation and even more waste, although of it self that is not AV.


It's also a step of reform in a direction towards nationwide candidates as opposed to solely through constituencies and that would be a *really* bad idea.  No matter how safe a seat is the UK public are not beyond delivering a shock - and that's all that matters.

The most popular candidate in a constituency wins the seat. The party or coalition with the most seats forms a government.   There's absolutely nothing wrong or unfair about that.  That the Tories can take seats is a sad indictment of the candidates and the other parties.  Maybe make constituencies smaller and more of them so it's easier to get a swing vote.  Libs championing AV reeked of changing the rules because they knew, even though it was a choice between Gordon Brown's Labour and Cameron's Conservatives, Lib Dems still struggled to win seats and be seen as an alternative.

There's a difference between just walking down the road minding your own business (in which case, I totally agree, you shouldn't have to identify yourself, assuming you've done nothing wrong) and being in charge of a motor vehicle.

Driving a car is the most dangerous thing that most people will ever do.  They really are lethal weapons that kill, injure and maim thousands of people in this country every year.  As much as I support the liberal cause, I think it is entirely proper and correct that the police have the right to check that anyone driving a vehicle has the right to do so (e.g. they own it, have it taxed and insured) and are in a fit state to do so. 

The law seems pretty fair to me.  If you don't have the relevant documents on you at the time then you're required to produce them at your local police station with 7 days.  If you don't like that then no-one is forcing you to drive a car.

&gt; (And before you say it, no, my driving license does not have a photograph on it.)

Nor does mine, but assuming everything's in order (tax, insurance, etc) then it's not a problem.

I can appreciate why you're angry, you have good cause to be. But if she has a long standing mental health problem, the condition has to take some of the blame. Teenage pregnancy and drug abuse - ask someone who works in mental health how often this is associated with women with poor mental health.

Community Mental Health team would be a good first stop, like loudribs said.

Your mum clearly can't, so get in touch with them and explain what happened. loudribs mentioned going through your GP but where I live you can contact them directly (stick your postcode into Google Maps and then search for Community Mental Health team). If you do go through the GP (difficult as your mum is unlikely to want to co-operate) make sure you see a GP that specialises in mental health (ask at the practice) and try to see the same GP for later appointments otherwise the whole process of getting a diagnosis and referral will be impossible.

true,Blaidd_Dwrg,eng-lancashire,Preston,"To elaborate, POL offers two types of account.

The Post Office Card Account is for the receipt of benefits and state pensions only and can be used to withdraw cash at Post Office counters and at Post Office branded ATMs only. It is provided by JP Morgan Europe Ltd and HP Enterprise Services.

The various flavours of savings accounts are obviously savings accounts and not suitable for OP's needs. They are provided by the Bank of Ireland.

They do not offer anything resembling a current account or a basic bank account.

Customer services for Post Office accounts are not provided by counter staff. If you go to them with any query other than withdrawals or balance checks they will refer you to the call centres. Even if you're a deaf, demented 90 year old pensioner. Amusingly JPM's banking licence does not permit them to give the balance over the phone, so if you're disabled and can only go to the Post Office once a week when your carer takes you, tough.

The ATMs, which are provided by BOI, are notoriously buggy. One common bug is that if the machine has run out of money, instead of declining the transaction it will give you what it has and deduct the full amount from your account. In most cases this will not be rectified automatically: you have to call the call centre who will then promise to get in touch with their banking partner who will manually credit the missing funds back to the account. This process takes weeks.

This pattern is pretty much the same for pretty much all the various services offered by the Post Office. They're all third party products with Post Office branding slapped on them, and they're all frankly shite.

Like other redditors below, I've used the word mong myself to describe being tired, stoned or hungover, which I already feel a bit embarrassed about, now that I've been reminded of where this word came from. But I think any situation where a relatively strong person is using humour aggressively to bully someone is not particularly funny, and especially when they are insulting one of the more vulnerable groups in society. As Richard Herring said elsewhere, is the freedom to use an outdated and insulting word the biggest battle that needs fighting in 2011?

1) not every police force will issue a producer. These are at the discretion of the officer. If you car shows not insured on the database and you cannot prove who you are then the vehicle can be seized

Simplest advise is this.

Carry your Photo counterpart of your driving license. then in your wallet carry a note with the following info

Insurance Company name -
Insurance Policy number -
Start and expiration of policy -

Police have numbers to call Insurers directly so if you have policy number they can quote it and get the details right away.

BIG difference...and yes, they still retain the right to enact in either part or not at all, even after interpretation [See EEAJC code, I believe from memory around article 7 but if you look at the pdf you'll find it there or there abouts].

I don't buy into the anti-EU campaign against silly directives like parabolas of a banana or straightness of a cucumber or whether prawn cocktail crisps are allowed or not.  The vast majority of directives, and they're largely only those centred on the single market anyway, make sense, regardless of who introduces them as a concept.  The fact remains they, those of the EEAJC, have not only wiggle room they have ballroom salsa room, on a lot of stuff that just makes a lot of sense anyway.  Then, in return, they get control of their own fisheries and agriculture (and UK agriculture is vastly different from the continental France and Germany), whilst the fisheries policy is one of the most expedient matters of the UK and least representative of the UK in th EU.

They also regain control of quotas, trade agreements outside the EU, a place at the WTO...for a country with a unique situation as its position in the Commonwealth that's huge, without going into the money saved as a net contributor to the EU.  The UK would still contribute to the EU as an EEA member, with interests still in the EU (the Irish bailout would still have gone ahead), it'd just be quids in.
 
Even on the big projects like the Eurofighter, Norway as EEA was practically begged to join.  The negotiations went on for years.  So the UK would still be privy to big projects [As it turned out Norway decided ultimately to go with updating their F16 stock].

What they do is they wait 3 weeks after you have committed the overdraft offence to send you a letter, it then arrives 3 days later by the time you get down to the bank to pay the fine or acquire funds to cover the charge it will be the next month so BAM they charge you another £32.50 which then as you guess will take you another 3 weeks to be notified.

If anti or pro-EU run an equally dirty campaign with the opposing side hardly putting up a fight, it will win. Whether or not its a good idea. That's down to personalities rather than policies. Elections always get dirty too but they are required since they are meant to speak for the people, referendums are not since we already elected people to make these choices.

And that's why I don't think we should have referendums.

Most people don't have a clue about the EU and what it does for us. So why should they get a say in what happens? I've not no clue at all as to whether we would really be better or worse.

Yeah, the only difference is we've seen a pro-EU Lisbon campaign already and in the dirty stakes the pro-Lisbon crowd knocked the socks of everybody else...the second time.  The first time they just ignored the vote in Ireland and then pulled rank for the second vote.  Anti-EU funding was disrupted, pro-EU money rolled in.  The same would happen in the UK only we actually know what the result in the UK would be regardless.

Only difference being after years of Scottish wining about a vote to independence now they have the chance with the SDP they're not doing it and England which has been largely pro-Unionist is growingly more pro a Scottish referendum, much as the EU is with the UKs indecision over their future in the EU.

&gt;And that's why I don't think we should have referendums.

In the words of the Spice Girls:

            STOP RIGHT THERE

You're endorsing EU Commission authoritarianism if you wish to deprive people of a vote.  Happy with that?  If you wish to argue the pros and cons of your fascism then I'm happy to continue, but at least realise that's the tar pit you've wandered into.

1. He has been a goal-scoring machine in every league he has participated in. 57 goals/ 78 appearances in Switzerland, 35 goals / 50 appearances in Russia, included in these 92 goals / 128 apps is 11 goals in 13 apps in Europa/Champions League

2. He is only 23 years old, a proven goalscorer in two respectable leagues that we could certainly sign to a long-term deal with plenty of time to gel with his teammates.

3. We do not really have any other targets. Our CL prospects this season are looking good but are quite uncertain. Guiseppe Rossi is unlikely, we will likely be outbid/out-priced on Leandro Diamao, Osvaldo has been linked with numerous clubs. 

4. He seems interested in playing for Harry, which of course hinges on the occupancy of the England managerial position post-euro 2012.

From my personal experiences watching him play I think he could be a special prospect, he is a balanced attacking player. At 5'10"" he is tall enough to win balls, but grounded enough to have highly underrated footwork and technical ability. And if you have watched him in the CL, you know that he does not squander chances in front of goal, his proficiency is quite remarkable in fact. I think we should take a chance and off-load the almost useless Pav back to Russia.

tl;dr IMO, definitely worth taking a chance on.

Haringey Council is also fairly Labour.

Why is it that my council, for the poorest county in England (Cornwall), can seemingly *expand* its services despite receiving cuts (which they planned ahead for)? 

They're not closing a single library or leisure centre, and are in fact starting to take certain things back in house (housing management for example). They've got the cash for things like funding a countywide EMA replacement for 16-18 year olds. They've also managed to secure funding for countywide high speed broadband (some of it EU funded).

Yes, they're old, black &amp; white, the sets are minimalist, flubbed lines weren't reshot, etc.  Still, it's the start and you should see it.

After that, you can skip to the end of the Pertwee era at least before things become semi-modern.  They're still a bit slow and drawn-out in pacing, and the SFX are cheap, but it becomes tolerable for a modern viewer with a bit of patience.

The (2nd?) last Pertwee episode, ""The Time Warrior"", is also the first Sara Jane episode and introduces the Sontarans.

The Tom Baker era is variable in story quality but Tom's got a great grin and his Doctor made it worth sitting through some pretty campy stuff.  From the first Tom Baker episode onwards, I recommend watching the first five minutes of each episode and deciding on a case-by-case basis if you want to watch it, watch it and skip the slow bits, or just skip the whole episode... and continue that way until you get to the end of the old run.",0,1319054426,null,0,false,0,c2sstfo,t3_lhpab,t1_c2sstfo,t1_c2srxdn,1427754447,2,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,2

No, the fact that I'm calling you names makes it clear that I don't respect you or anything you say very much. This statement you made is a good reason why. You're rather illogical and ignorant (e.g. not knowing what an opinion is and believing opinions somehow cancel out).

Doctor Who ran from 1963-1989 then rebooted in 2005. By no means do I suggest you start at 1963. You should choose between 2005 reluanch and 2010 when the new writer, Doctor, and companions took over. It felt very much like a re-relaunch.

Pros of 2005: you get to see more Doctors, more adventures, 
companions, etc. You won't miss out on it by skipping it. No prior info needed to watch here

Cons: It's a bit cheesy and the writing needs a lot of forgiveness the first two series. The show still shines though.

For 2010 Pros: Great writing, shiny new everything, same awesomeness that DW always has, fresh start, no prior info needed

Cons: You miss out on 2005-2009. You won't get to experience the show chronologically and see how things change and develop. You'll get spoiled by the special effects.

Even with these pros and cons, if you choose 2010 you should go back afterwards to 2005 and up. While the writing and effects may not be as shiny, there are still wonderful heartbreaking stories here, and both Doctors absolutely shine. Many people went on Who-hiatus because they thought the new guy wouldn't live up to the 10th Doctor. The ninth only has one series with some questionable writing, but he's a fantastic Doctor as well, and shines when given the chance. No matter what you do, watch all six series.

If you choose to start at 2005, please watch Blink beforehand. 2005 is a little hard and Blink will reassure you that it's worth it.",0,1319062797,null,0,false,0,c2su52z,t3_lh8u5,t1_c2su52z,t3_lh8u5,1427755067,3,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,3

You were trying to calm me down, you said?

&gt;So what if I'm bad at it? I thought the hyperboles would be obvious enough.

""Your opinion doesn't invalidate my opinion that it's a dumb joke that's been played out 8 billion different times by the same hipster 5-year olds.""

Hyperboles aren't much of a factor here. Your intent is still pretty clear and sincere. Especially given your followup to fellow joke-misser sir_joe_cool. 

&gt;And OP's defense was that I needed crampons, so I don't think you have a say in what's sincere.

That conclusion really doesn't follow the premise.

&gt;You jumped in defending him, so yup.

No I didn't. All I did was say that opinion doesn't mean what you think it does and your claim of an unwavering opinion is misplaced. I never once made a reference to the TC.

&gt;I only said those statements AFTER you continually nitpicked at everything I wrote, trying to attack how I argued instead of the actual discussion.

What discussion? Your ""discussion"" basically amounted to yelling at the world to stop bashing on Twilight when nobody was taking any bashing seriously. Really, it's a lot like this: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kHmvkRoEowc. Any discussion that could have been had immediately went out the window when you dismissed solid fact as opinion. What would the followup have been? Something like this, I'd gather:

Me: This isn't the place for your rant because it's a light-hearted joke.

You: Yes but it always happens. People need to just stop it.

There's no ""discussion"" to be had with you if you come into a post about a light-hearted jab and preach to people to stop making such jokes.


&gt;You've been complaining about me and insulting my inferior methods at arguing, congrats you are an internet champion A++ would buy again.

Haven't complained about you yet either. But at least you're consistent with using your encyclopedic knowledge of internet memes as some sort of argument supplement.

&gt;Hating on Twilight/Bieber fans is stupid and a dumb reddit circlejerk. Yeah, it's popular outside reddit. But it's popular here too. Doesn't detract from it at all.

No, that would add to it.... which nobody was denying anyway. All that was said was that it's not a ""reddit circlejerk"" so much as it is a, you know, *societal* circlejerk.

&gt;I thought I made a legitimate point

If that was a legitimate point, then pointing out that animal farming is a disgusting practice in a post about a cute picture of a chicken nuzzling against a pig is a legitimate point as well. A legitimate point to what, I don't know, besides going off on a tangent for the sake of expressing views.

&gt;the only thing wrong I did was fail to be politically correct enough

Dismissing fact as opinion in order to stand on your own isn't a breach of political correctness. That's a breach of rhetoric.

&gt;YOU made it a big deal by trying to turn it into a big argument.

I did? Funny. All I did was say that what you dismissed as an opinion wasn't and then you responded trying to justify yourself while generalizing everyone who went against your views.

&gt;I'm not allowed to post my complaints or what I feel is wrong with the way some people thing now?

Who said you weren't? If it's in proper context and follows proper rhetoric (which means not throwing out someone else's argument by pretending it's something else entirely), why not? Also, I'm not a mod or admin. I don't have the ability to revoke permissions (and even if I did, I wouldn't--that's for people who blatantly disrupts and upend the system).

&gt;No, you made it a big deal.

Your conclusion doesn't follow, again. And aren't you the one who decided to come back to this a day and a half later? I certainly wasn't.

And don't forget, Nationwide owns several of those evil share-trading companies and greedy profit-driven funds management firms!

To be fair, Genk was not playing their starting 11 either due to injuries and their Championship winning GK...well we bought him and loaned him out. (Insert troll face here)

Well, this is technically true, but a bit misleading for people who don't actually read the article.

In a nutshell, undercover cops maintained their cover after being rounded up and sent to trial, as opposed to blowing their cover. They gave their false identities while testifying and being prosecuted instead of revealing themselves as undercover.

While the headline is technically true, it gives the impression that the undercover cops were authorized to bear false witness, or make up evidence. This is not the case. No that it will matter. Let the knee-jerk begin!!

The real problem is that we have had a consumer market in which the consumers share of the pie has reduced year upon year. So effectively we're expecting people to keep driving the economy with less and less of that economy each year. To substitute the gap we went with credit. Eventually we ran out of credit as well. Then the inherent madness of basing your economy upon the spending of people with an increasingly shrinking share of the economy has been exposed.

The solution isn't less welfare. It is more welfare. The problem is a prisoners dilemma where for each company it is better if all the other companies paid higher taxes to pay for welfare (and higher wages as well) without them actually paying more. Since companies can only control their own actions we get every company seeking to do the wrong thing overall. This is why stuff like minimum wage, welfare and corporation tax are good things. Companies see that all these things are good if everyone but them does them. No company is ever going to do the right thing in isolation because their competitors who don't will out compete them.

I see what you're saying, and I perhaps lack the education to eloquently rebut it, but I will try nonetheless.

&gt;it would be possible to commit fraud on a vast scale, interfere with public utilities, disrupt road, rail, and air traffic, without fear of punishment.

It seems to me possible to restrict a specific kind of activity without limiting the expression of an idea, or without even limiting a specific set of words which exist in a specific order. So for example limiting the right to use a radio on a specific frequency to contact air craft, as opposed to limiting the right to say ""Alpha 4 Niner this is Ground Control, decend 5000"".

You can legislate against mechanisms and their uses without needing to legislate against freedom of speech or expression.

I have to admit that the idea of *more* stories somehow making a show weaker frankly is, boring and stupid; and not very Doctor Who: a show that is, was, and always will be willing to contradict anything that's happened in a previous story (or the same story if it's a six parter) whether it be TV, audio, novel, or comic. Many stories from the sixties were happily ""obliterated"" by stories in the seventies, who were then ""obliterated"" by the eighties. The EDA novels used to have a rotating door of ""obliteration"" for everything. That's what Doctor Who does; Heck, Moffet's ""obliterated"" his own stories from the same season. 


I know New Fans hate finding out that they're missing stuff (and many have an aversion to listening to something without pictures - or heaven forbid - reading a book) but the people making the show for telly now have been creating Doctor Who stories for a very long time and the stories are woven into a story that goes back to the Virgin New Adventures and worms it's way backwards into the old series to the very beginning.

No, there's quite a bit more to it but you have to admit you burning the metaphoric Reichstag because you want to empower a form of governance rather than empower the people is quite a far way down a  Fascism cul-de-sac.

&gt;pointed out that public opinion, didn't want to go to war. But we did anyway.

So your now for empowering the people over government - so you're back to wanting a referendum now?  You've not thought this one through.

&gt;So should we have a referendums on gay marriage, Liam Fox, Libya, Syria, the NHS, University fees, illegal Gypsy camps, phone hacking, the 2012 Olympics, drugs, policing, animals, riots and prisons too?

Y'up!  It would be the most progressive society in the world if we did, and the envy of the world.  Let's face it, if we did there'd be full gay marriage, there'd be a local election in Liam Fox's constituency, we wouldn't have been propping up a dictator, we'd stay the hell out of Syria, the NHS reforms would be watered down again,  university would be free, local planning laws would be enforced for much less, we'd get to the bottom of phone hacking, we'd have an Olympics, certain drugs would be legalised, policing powers would reduced but so would the bureaucracy, animal rights would improve, riots would be condemned and prisons would improve but there'd be more places.  

That's public opinion and that all sounds pretty good.

&gt;If you think no to any of them, then lets just absolutely establish that you don't want democratic referendums on these topics. That's fascist (apparently).

See you're being obtuse now.  There's a difference between a referendum on Europe and foreign governance therein and domestic government which these things fall under.  We actually have some control over our representatives.  We have no control over the ECommission.  They're appointed.  Even in the assembly there's only a split 8% with the most popular UK parties with some of the weaker EU voting blocs.  It's not representative at all.  Are any of the points you raised to do with changing governance itself like it is when you want to deprive a choice of how much autonomy the EU has over the UK?  No.  Not one.  

You're arguing policy over constitution.  Apples and oranges.

If I were to have said No to any of those things I'd have been empowering Westminster to make the choices.  As it is you don't want a referendum because you don't want control in either Westminster or with the British people.  Not only control but you even want to rob them of choice.

How is you empowering your own form of government unpopular with the people, depriving them of choice, not akin to burning the Reichstag?",0,1319117526,null,0,true,0,c2szmv9,t3_lgb96,t1_c2szmv9,t1_c2stdfg,1427757724,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

Well I had to wonder if you understood what was going on. You made it sound like people were occupying land on a whim or for fun at the expense of the rest of us.

They are protesting many things - If you listen to them they'll tell you.

I was protesting in London the other weekend (an unrelated issue to this movement): Was I tarnishing the image of London to tourists? Even if I was, I wasn't aware that we should refrain from voicing the issues we have with the way in which the country is run because it might upset foreign visitors.

The tube drivers have been after better pay, I think, which is what they got recently. But that's hardly a similar issue.

&gt; What do ""occupy"" protesters want? We already know they don't know.

Again... [Ask them or read what they've said and you'll know](http://hereisthecity.com/2011/10/18/occupy-london-stock-exchange-what-they-want/). Unless you're listening to certain media outlets who have been quite clear that they do not support the movement have been cheerfully spreading misinformation. Sure you'll be able to find a few people who are there for the ride, but don't assume that most have no idea.

edit - I haven't taken a stance on the protests at the moment, but I find the things people will downvote about to be quite interesting.

true,ScreamingGerman,null,null,"&gt; the Ramires and Meireles roles are interchangeable with Romeu and Mikel and Essien

I disagree. There's more nuances to our midfielders than to just call them all central midfielders. Mikel is the most defensive minded, a pure CDM; Ramires and Essien are both of the box-to-box variety, Essien better at defending, Ramires better at attacking between the two; Lampard is a central attacking midfielder. Meireles is versatile but lacks a strong defensive game, so he could be used as a deep-lying playmaker, box-to-box midfielder, or attacking midfielder. Romeu is suited to a deep, defensive role like Mikel, but is showing signs of surpassing his ability and adding a larger range of passing.

The deep two of the 4-2-3-1 are very important, as they need to essentially control the midfield on their own. It'd be a departure from the traditional midfield trio that Chelsea employ, as we'd commit another player much further forward than usual. Our 4-3-3 could be quickly adjusted to the 4-2-3-1 simply by moving Lampard up into the space behind the CF and between the two wide forwards.

You need good balance between the two deep midfielders then. Ramires and Meireles are both pretty attack minded midfielders, although both are apt at covering the full length of the pitch. To fully control the midfield, it's best to employ a pure defensive midfielder (Mikel, Romeu) as well as a strong box-to-box type mid, who is apt at creating chances from deep but can also help defend when possession is lost. Meireles, Ramires and Essien are good fits, I think a fit Essien being the best fit. Lampard somewhat fits into it but to fully unlock his potential requires him playing in the ""free"" CM role in a 4-3-3.

What needs to be understood is the time frame of the season, it's not happening within a space of weeks, it occurs over months and years. Admittedly it's not something that is made clear though.

The second season is set during the great war, of course there was going to be death and injury, the world is changing and so is Downton, which acts as a microcosm of the world at that time. Personally I think the tragedy of the last episode aired was wonderful, and I for one can't wait to see how it impacts events later on.

My only gripe would be Bates' wife, she is painted too obviously to be the villain of the piece but as Downton has proved before, there's always two sides to the coin. It's building up to something, and I for one couldn't guess what that is.

Rant over, I figured someone has to defend the second season, it is clearly superior to the first which was already excellent. If it remains this consistent for the coming series', it will go down as one of the best TV shows ever made.

No, we'd be paralysed by laws that aren't thought through since they are controlled not by the people in the know, but by people outside who have no clue. The banks would have all collapsed (with all our money), the NHS would be in even more financial trouble, and according to recent polls, we'd have brought back corporal and capital punishment. 


Will we have another referendum in a weeks time when public opinion shifts?

Public opinion will always be in what's good for the person, not the country. We wouldn't be facing any cuts, taxes would drop and the debt issue would spiral out of control if we let the public have a say in
things they have no idea about.

The stuff we sell is not made by us. We're a middle man for different brands. We have our own 'value-range' of items but they're made by cookworks just with out name on. We sell Russell Hobbs, Bosch, Bush, Samsung, Nike, Regatta, and a whole lot more brands. If it breaks, take it up with them, not the middle-man. Would you blame Amazon if a Bush TV you bought from there broke? Or would you blame Bush?

We don't actually make our own stuff. Everything we sell is available direct from the manufacturer and a lot of it is cross-sold in places like Clas Ohlson.

TV's aren't overpriced. Profit on selling TV's is just under 10%, the prices for TV's are practically the same in all shops because it's such a competitive market and there are very few ways you can undercut the competition in their sale prices. The rest of our items are actually pretty competitive. We sell the toy range Chad Valley for cheaper than Woolworths ever sold it (it was their range), and we have year round 2 for £15 offers on a few hundred toys, where the same two items will cost you £25+ at Toys 'R' Us. 

In fact, if anyone has any actual questions about Argos or what happens 'behind the scenes' you can just ask me now if you want.

They give **up to** 40% of profits  to members (only 22% in 2010).  Of this, 70% is redistributed to individuals based on how many points they have accrued buying coop products and services.  In 2010 you were paid 2p per point, and you got 1 point for every £1 spend on food for example, equivalent to a 2% discount.

http://www.co-operative.coop/Corporate/PDFs/Annual_Report_2010.pdf

You earn 1 point for every £10 held in a current account which equates to 0.02% interest on top of the standard 0.25%.

The boxes themselves where just a few sheets of thin wood with window holes cut out with a jigsaw. Then about 1cm strips where used to create the paneling effect. 

The roofs where made by gluing some 3/4 inch boards together and sending them through the table saw with the blade at an angle. 

The light at the top were left over bubble blowers from my brother in law's wedding. Basically just a clear plastic tube. About an inch of epoxy was dripped into them so that they would catch the light and seem to sparkle. The epoxy was purposely poorly stirred to create bubbles for the light to catch. 

The window crossbars where just a pattern printed on a transparency. Then tissue paper was put on the outside. So when the lights are on in the inside it glows nicely.  

The inside is covered in tinfoil so that the light reflects the most. Dolar store LEDs are the main light. Then two tea-light leds are attached to the roof to give a flickering effect. 

Thats most of the details. I will be happy to answer any questions.

Ha!  Coming from the man that wants to burn down everyone's public right to accountability and democracy because they don't fit with his political ideals and goals, that's rich!!!

&gt;You sound like the activist who called the Dale farm eviction ""ethnic cleansing"". You've jumped straight to an extreme view when it is nothing like that.

Even though I've just said that, ""local planning laws would be enforced for much less"", that is that I support the eviction?

Robotchan, I won't be the first person to say this to you, but you sir are a fucking idiot.  One that is arguing for the equivalent of burning down a Reichstag.  There's a world of difference between voting on policy and not voting and forcing constitutional reform without even addressing the people although they're asking for it!

&gt;. Knee jerk extreme emotional reactions. And that's why I'm against referendums.

And that's what lead you to force your own EU-statism on 500 million people, state above the voices of the people, that drives you to deny these people a voice to power central government and totalitarianism.  A system that rewards private enterprise directly through NGOs and with an appointed Trade Commissioner.

Now what do we call someone that empowers institutionalised identity over the voice and wishes of the people, that doesn't allow democratic dissent, that awards and controls pro-institutional private enterprise, that believes in expansionism, that has centralised foreign policy and adopts authoritarianism?  All the things you've just defended.

You've just proven all my points about you. You are totally unable to be even slightly objective about this. I've not told you my 'political ideals and goals', nor do I think you have a clue. Instead of going from A to B in a logical sense, you've leapt to Z by assuming things, missing out everything in between.

Burn down? Very vivid.

&gt;Robotchan, I won't be the first person to say this to you, but you sir are a fucking idiot

Again... you show your class and level of intelligence. Stop getting so wound up, you'll only make bad choices.

&gt;And that's what lead you to force your own EU-statism on 500 million people,

&gt;Now what do we call someone that empowers institutionalised identity over the voice and wishes of the people, that doesn't allow democratic dissent, that awards and controls pro-institutional private enterprise, that believes in expansionism, that has centralised foreign policy and adopts authoritarianism? All the things you've just defended.

And again, you seem to have mistaken that I am in full support of our membership to the EU. Please show me where I said that I am in favour of EU membership or not. In fact I specifically stated that I do not know either way. Like predicting economics, much of it is guess work.


Would you prefer me to fix your car, or a mechanic?

Would you prefer me to deliver your child, or a doctor?

But you'd rather me guess the outcome of staying in the EU, than the people who've been working in it and know how it works.


&gt;Yeah, much of the indoctrinated people didn't know they'd become fascist either until it was too late. Way to repeat history, Robotchan.

Yes, I've been supporting groups who murder and use violence against  opponents. I can see the similarities between not wanting a referendum and extremist views. I must be only one step away from cleansing a race from the planet.

In order to make things less confusing for newcomers with all the history the show has, they invented a new backstory for the Doctor.

But you are being a dick, and obviously calming you down wasn't working.

Yup. OR you can interpret it as being super super meanie weanie to the OP!

&gt;No I didn't. All I did was say that opinion doesn't mean what you think it does and your claim of an unwavering opinion is misplaced. I never once made a reference to the TC.

Then why are you making this such a big shitstorm? After all, I'm Mr. Twilight Defender according to you.

&gt;What discussion? Your ""discussion"" basically amounted to yelling at the world to stop bashing on Twilight when nobody was taking any bashing seriously.

Nobody was taking it seriously? Yeah, people downvoted me but then came back to upvote me, with one person even personally thanking me for what I wrote. So don't make up conclusions on your own.

&gt;There's no ""discussion"" to be had with you if you come into a post about a light-hearted jab preach to people to stop making such jokes.

It was a shitty joke, and I wasn't *preaching*. I was giving my two cents on this whole phenomenon and I obviously can't get through to you that I'm allowed to preach or give my opinion if I want to. There apparently was a discussion to be had, because I was both downvoted AND upvoted. That means people agreed with me, and people didn't. Don't come to conclusions on your own.

&gt;If that was a legitimate point, then pointing out that animal farming is a disgusting practice in a post about a cute picture of a chicken nuzzling against a pig is a legitimate point as well. A legitimate point to what, I don't know, besides going off on a tangent for the sake of expressing views.

YOU don't get to decide what's legitimate around here. If I think it's a topic for discussion, then let me discuss it or just downvote and be on your way. And your analogy was nothing like that at all, it was a picture of Matt Smith saying he sent Dracula to kill Stephanie Meyers OH LOLOLO SO FUNNY.

&gt;Dismissing fact as opinion in order to stand on your own isn't a breach of political correctness. That's a breach of rhetoric.

No, because if I had put ""just generalizing, but....."" OP wouldn't have shat bricks on me and you wouldn't have either.

&gt;I did? Funny. All I did was say that what you dismissed as an opinion wasn't and then you responded trying to justify yourself while generalizing everyone who went against your views.

But I admitted I was generalizing and people decided to ignore that. Especially you.

&gt;Who said you weren't? If it's in proper context and follows proper rhetoric (which means not throwing out someone else's argument by pretending it's something else entirely), why not? Also, I'm not a mod or admin. I don't have the ability to revoke permissions (and even if I did, I wouldn't--that's for people who blatantly disrupts and upend the system).

Well, you're being super judgey on what I write, HOW I write (oh sweet jesus I'm breaching rhetoric!), making disproportional analogies, and being super fucking serious about this.

&gt;Your conclusion doesn't follow, again. And aren't you the one who decided to come back to this a day and a half later? I certainly wasn't.

What in the actual fuck are you talking about.

&gt;Using nothing more than freely available speech recognition software and the application of the pricinciple of free speech as advocated by you, it would be possible to commit fraud on a vast scale, interfere with public utilities, disrupt road, rail, and air traffic, without fear of punishment.

&gt;Ingredients: One computer, one internet connection, one copy of speech recognition software.

That's not a specific example, that's suggestions of tools which might be usable in an example. I did replied to what was an implied example, that of someone disrupting air traffic control using their voice, and rebutted it. If you want me to answer any specific example, provide a specific example.

&gt; Theft and Fraud are the two most commonly committed crimes using computers and as I have said already, neither the computer nor the software on it need to be set up specifically to facilitate the criminal act.

I'm struggling to see how this ties into freedom of speech, again, please ilucidate where the conflict arises.

&gt;There is no responsible individual other than the operator and the operator has done nothing but speak.

If a computer commits fraud by the mere act of someone speaking, then that computer is following programming which commands it to commit fraud upon certain commands being uttered, and therefore there is a criminal act unrelated to speech being committed.

&gt;Explain how this crime would be punished if your principle of free speech were applied the way you are advocating it here.

It wasn't mean at all. Just not a valid counterargument.

&gt;Then why are you making this such a big shitstorm? After all, I'm Mr. Twilight Defender according to you.

You do realize your original responses were longer than mine, right? I'm pretty sure yours require more effort than mine too. And, once again, you're coming back a day later for more. I'm only reacting.

&gt;Nobody was taking it seriously? Yeah, people downvoted me but then came back to upvote me, with one person even personally thanking me for what I wrote. So don't make up conclusions on your own.

No, you got *more* upvotes and *more* downvotes. Nobody changed anything. Also, it's not even a good metric anyway. But if you still want to use them as a reference to quality, OP has a considerable amount more in his response. Oh, and the person who thanked you? He has the lowest rated comment in this entire thread. This was it:

""So the Doctor led a woman to death... because he didn't like her lame teenage romance novel that just happened to get really popular around 2009? Yes.. that sounds like the Doctor alright...

I really hate american hipsters watching Doctor Who... Leave now, and quit using my life-time like a damn meme... He's the Doctor for god sake! He has way bigger things to worry about than what ever stupid things you do or don't like.""

Yeah. If that's not idiotic, then the nice folks at Oxford have a very big mystery on their hands. I'd rather have no support than this guy's support any day. People with this little sense of humour, this big a sense of entitlement and this short a fuse are only asking to be outcast.

&gt;YOU don't get to decide what's legitimate around here. If I think it's a topic for discussion, then let me discuss it or just downvote and be on your way. 

I didn't downvote you at all. Haven't yet either. Nothing you said is deserving of one. You made a constructive post but it wasn't a legitimate response. The analogy stands. I only came in when you dismissed fact as opinion.

&gt;And your analogy was nothing like that at all, it was a picture of Matt Smith saying he sent Dracula to kill Stephanie Meyers OH LOLOLO SO FUNNY.

Immature sense of justice and balance aside--exactly. It was a picture of Matt Smith saying he sent Dracula to kill Stephanie Meyer. Clearly a joke since, you know, Dracula's not real. And most people responded with amusement. You, however, decided to take serious offense and put up a sort of PSA for some unknowable reason as if this was a staple ritual of society, much like those people who point out factory farming when people post pictures of cute animals.

&gt;No, because if I had put ""just generalizing, but....."" OP wouldn't have shat bricks on me and you wouldn't have either.

OP shat bricks on you with ""god its just a joke JFC""? You're actually claiming that as a personal insult? Really? And, once again, you could have framed it any way you like, I still would have pointed out that ""its just a joke"" is still fact and not an opinion and that you can't just dismiss it.


&gt;But I admitted I was generalizing and people decided to ignore that. Especially you.

Probably for the same reason I don't go easy on people who admit to doing something wrong/stupid on purpose.

&gt;Well, you're being super judgey on what I write, HOW I write (oh sweet jesus I'm breaching rhetoric!), making disproportional analogies, and being super fucking serious about this.

I don't think you understand what rhetoric is if you think it has to do with how you write. It has to do with *what* you write. And what you wrote are your arguments--or the very points you're trying to make. I don't have any problem with *how* you write. If you choose to express yourself through memes, more power to you.

&gt;Er, I'm sorry I didn't reply quick enough? I put it off until later, I'm sorry your highness. You're making it a big deal. It doesn't matter that I came back to it late, quick making faulty connections. If you reply, I'm going to reply back.

Speed of response wasn't what I was highlighting--it was the fact that you came (and keep coming) back to respond to what were nothing more than a sentence and a few words from the previous day. Why did I point that out? To show that it was *you* who are making a ""big deal"" out of this. Once again, I'm simply responding.

I know which because I wrote it. When your comment has been around for about 30mins and it's up 3 up 3 down, it's not the system that's balancing things but people deciding to vote a certain way. I sometimes make an edit to point it out because it's perfectly obvious people click the blue button because they don't like what was said rather than concluding it doesn't add anything to the conversation. Such behaviour isn't carried out by people who don't get upset when their opinions are contradicted: It's a childish way of attempting to silence people. Similar to downvoting someone when they point it out. But at least you've read the rules, eh?

The talk of St Paul's asking us to leave originated from the Times and (from what we can see from behind the paywall) looked fairly biased.

Doctor Who ran from 1963-1989 then rebooted in 2005. By no means do I suggest you start at 1963. You should choose between 2005 reluanch and 2010 when the new writer, Doctor, and companions took over. It felt very much like a re-relaunch.

Pros of 2005: you get to see more Doctors, more adventures, companions, etc. You won't miss out on it by skipping it. No prior info needed to watch here

Cons: It's a bit cheesy and the writing needs a lot of forgiveness the first two series. The show still shines though.

For 2010 Pros: Great writing, shiny new everything, same awesomeness that DW always has, fresh start, no prior info needed

Cons: You miss out on 2005-2009. You won't get to experience the show chronologically and see how things change and develop. You'll get spoiled by the special effects.

Even with these pros and cons, if you choose 2010 you should go back afterwards to 2005 and up. While the writing and effects may not be as shiny, there are still wonderful heartbreaking stories here, and both Doctors absolutely shine. Many people went on Who-hiatus because they thought the new guy wouldn't live up to the 10th Doctor. The ninth only has one series with some questionable writing, but he's a fantastic Doctor as well, and shines when given the chance. No matter what you do, watch all six series.

For instance one of the reasons that the old cybermen don't seem very robotic is because they are very evidently dudes in silver material suits. The very simple act of adding machine-like sounds whenever they move would have made them appear more like machine men, but they didn't add any sound at all.

true,LokianEule,mccoy,Time's Champion,"Oh yes. In one big sentence: Doctor Who is a British sci-fi show about a 900+ year old alien known just as the Doctor, who travels through time and space in a blue box, having adventures as he goes.

The Doctor is from the planet Gallifrey, he's an adventurer, ""a dreamer of impossible dreams"". His ship, the TARDIS, just looks like a blue box because of it's faulty cloaking system- the chameleon circuit.

The show is nearing it's 50th anniversary, btw- 2013. Doctor Who is a very good show because it's very flexible and doesn't stagnate. You can have episodes about timey-wimey travel plots, emotional historicals, alien space battles, good romps and fun, tear-jerking stories, and scare-the-crap out of you good. Somewhere in it's 33 seasons (or 6 series for the relaunch) is a story you will adore. There's an episode for everyone.

Another thing is that it's not the ""We are here on behalf of the United Federation of Planets, we demand you relinquish our battlecruiser on negotiation terms..."" deal. This is not Star Trek or Star Wars by any means. It's more of a space adventure get-yourself-into-trouble wibbly-wobbly-spacey-wacey ball of fun.

Also, the show doesn't stagnate because a new head writer takes over every few years, and the Doctor (a Gallifreyan Time Lord) can regenerate his body when near death/dead/dying etc. This means that his cells change and he gets a new body, new appearance, different personality and goes on living. We are currently on Doctor 11 (not including the non-official ones).

About 74% of the rioters had some sort of previous run-in with the law. 54% were previously convicted of offences.

But the staggering thing was the average number of offences per person was almost 20. And the average age was between 15-30. This is completely ridiculous... the fact that people in their 20's can have 20 criminal convictions is insane. And the fact that they have the ability to continue to re-offend is disappointing. Why aren't these people in jail after the 10th, 11th, 12th etc etc etc offence?!

I don't want to sound classist or a snob, but a HUGE proportion of crime is carried out by a small population. If we could just deal with those people, the overall crime rate would fall dramatically.

true,Dain42,tardis,TARDIS,"Oh. Sorry. *(sheepish look)*  I'd figured they'd have covered the terms ISA, RISC, CISC when they did assembly.

**FOSS** = Free and Open Source Software (not an official abbreviation, but common)

**ISA** = Instruction Set Architecture - describes both the assembly/object code instructions as well as the way the hardware (specifically the CPU) must interpret them (though nothing about specific internal design of the hardware). *Ex: [x86](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86), [PowerPC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PowerPC), [ARM](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARM_architecture)*

**RISC** = Reduced Instruction Set Computing - ISAs which contain fewer instructions and are less complex leading to greater uniformity between instructions, and (potentially) simpler processor designs. Are uniformly load-store machines: before working with data it ***must*** be retrieved from memory and placed in a register, then copied back when  you're finished with it (if you want to save the result for further use). (This reduces the number of instructions by eliminating the need a whole class of them that deals with operating directly on contents of memory.) *Ex: PowerPC, ARM, [MIPS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIPS_architecture) (MIPS-32 was used in the PlayStation 2 console)*

**CISC** = Complete/Complex Instruction Set Computing - didn't have a name before RISC came along. This was just standard. There is an instruction for every damn thing you do. In fact, there are probably 5 (or more)--one for each type of memory access you might use. *Ex: Intel x86, x64*

*A note on load-store machines:* it seems at first like it would slow everything down, but the most time-consuming part of any operation involving reading from/writing to memory is the actual read or write. So no matter whether it's all contained in one instruction (CISC) or spread over three (RISC), you still take the time for all three steps: load-operate-store.

That was probably *More Information Than You Require*, but I thought as a CompSci student you'd be more likely to be interested than most.",0,1319170987,null,0,true,0,c2t7cip,t3_lhlvh,t1_c2t7cip,t1_c2t1r5e,1427761428,1,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,1
