I in a tiny way disagree with Moffat's attempt to reset the idea of the doctor getting to well known. I think thats exactly where the story needs to go. He can't be an adventurer forever. He has the ""great power, great responsibility"" thing hanging over his head and he has forever. I think seeing the doctor give up the tardis and, basically, fun would be a much sadder ending than even having him die but I think you could make it work.

It's a must-watch, though I can't get through it without tearing up several times. Even knowing how much I've enjoyed Matt Smith and that transitioning to the Moffat era with #10 in the role would simply not have worked as well... when Tennant chokes up, I feel it.

Simplest explanation is that she missed intentionally because Rory/Amy would surely find it odd that she's so fast on the draw when hats are in play, but not when the Doctor is being gunned down. She does say ""Of course not"" after she misses and it seems like we're supposed to take that to mean it's her, which is why I'm resisting a bit. :)

Of course I would have a problem with someone showing a five year old porn or any other nasty stuff. Why would someone want to do that anyway? 

Most people very closely supervise young children's access to the internet. I can't imagine a school where five year olds are left unattended to surf the web.  If there are such institutions, they presumably have bigger problems than government censorship would solve.

Once kids are old enough to have independent access to the net, they will look at whatever they look at. I find the idea somewhat unsavoury but I also recognise that censorship doesn't prevent unsavoury stuff, it just creates an atmosphere in which people are conditioned about their relationship with authority.

That makes it easier for blind people to know what you are giving them but more importantly it means that you cant bleach a 5 and print onto it the image of a 10, 20 or 50.  So you cant use cheaper notes as a source of the special paper needed for counterfitting.

If you assume there is some minimum size of note in order for it to be big enough for a decent sized image and for water marks and other stuff and for it not to wear out too quickly.  Then add 10mm length and width each time you go up a denomination you quickly get 50s that are an inch longer and wider than 5s.

Simple really.

I guess the real problem is that US notes are tiny (no graduated size, plus they are small to start with since they print a lot of them because they have $1s and who can afford to buy all that special paper?) and the wallet market (being international) accommodates them as standard.

Problem - Energy companies political influence (lobbying, whatever) &amp; enough vested interests in gov'ts globally means it's *never going to happen*. 

That's just one example &amp; the main problem with all of the choices listed there is the political and social will required to *get the damn thing setup*.

At least with Nuclear it's the lesser of several evils... it's zero carbon (the main issue in preventing catastrophic global warming) it produces a *lot* of energy (compared to, say, a wind farm) and it's actually going to happen (the main thing, IMO, compared to the other, cleaner and greener solutions).

So yes the energy corporations can monopolize them?  TBH Edf or whoever can monopolize whatever they like, they own quite a few wind farms, I believe.

I agree that we should look for better solutions, and better solutions are available, but given a choice of coal, gas and nuclear I know which I'd go for.

Make your mind up!

&gt;censorship doesn't prevent unsavoury stuff, it just creates an atmosphere in which people are conditioned about their relationship with authority.

the internet filtering the paper discusses, is about what is/isn't accessible in PUBLIC BUILDINGS, not blanketed internet filtering.  Of course authority should be challenged where appropriate, but preventing access to porn/terrorist/graphic material in places like Libraries, prisons, schools does not condition people into blindy obeying authority.

true,[deleted],null,null,"None of that really jives with any of my own thoughts, but I'm having trouble working the Silence into my own ""big picture"" theory of what's really going on, and you seem to have thought about them more than me, so I'll just give you what I've got and maybe if we meet in the middle somewhere, we'll have something interesting? 

First off, the elephant in the room is who is Kovarian *really*? Is she the be all end all orchestrator of the insane amount of manipulation of the Doctor and his companions that has been going on since the very beginning of Series 5? I personally doubt it. I think absolutely everyone, everyone, everyone (The Doctor, Amy, Rory, River, The Anglican Army, Kovarian, the Silence, everyone, innocent or not) is a piece on the chessboard of an as-yet-unseen person or persons (speculate all day about Omega, Daleks, whatevs). 

I think the Doctor is the last being left in the universe able to maintain the web of time. I think he took his eyes off of that for long enough when he rengenerated to allow himself to be drawn in to a reality that is designed from the go to lead him to his destruction. To spell it out plainly, Amy was a trap for the Doctor from day one. River was manipulated into existence to seal the Doctor into a course that will destroy him, whether she was the one who pulled the trigger or not. I actually think that the ""darkening"" of the Doctor's name is not the fault of the Doctor *at all* but a result of a campaign (by the previously mentioned person or persons unknown) to convince the Doctor that his name inspires fear and anguish so that he will go willingly to the slaughter. There aren't any  holes that I can find in this *per se*. Maybe the Silence *are* the big bad. They certainly would have the means to manipulate such a course of action and they would want the Doctor out of the way if they want to reshape the web of time their way as they are engaged in trying to build time technology of their own. Interesting how the Doctor was ""too much"" for their machine. Maybe River is ""just enough"". Would be interesting if the story winds back to the Silence really being the big bad after all and the events of Astronaut/Day of the Moon were shown to us at the beginning to throw all of us off the scent. This is all conjecture of course but could fit. The last few sentences were brand new since as I mentioned I hadn't really put much thought into the Silence's role thinkng they were just tools of the big bad, but maybe they are the end of this season's rabbit hole after all. The more I think about it, the more it fits. 
River/Melody is created. Kovarian escapes to deliver her to the Silence. Fast forward/backward to 1969 and blammo. 
However, it doesn't account for the aforementioned pictures of Amy with her child. Oh well, I still think I'm kinda close in at least some aspects.

I was able to re-create a step-by-step account of the child's actions and presented it to the staff member to show that it wasn't a school failing. 

The child in question had done the correct thing at the time and reported it to their teacher/teaching assistant. The staff member of that department then asked me if I could just check and see what their intent was when they found it. (example - if a child was actively searching for pornography then a disciplinary action would have to be taken, parents informed etc.)

The child had genuinely innocently found this image - it was on an unrelated image search and was the only image of it's nature on the results page. The website it was from was blocked by multiple filters (a blogspot page iirc) and even if the child had attempted to click the image, the fullsize one would not have been rendered on their screen. The only reason they saw it at all is because a thumbnail of it was stored on Google's servers and presented in a search result.

In this situation we send home a routine letter basically saying the child innocently found an image on the internet which may raise questions from the child. This letter basically keeps us out of the shit incase little Johnny goes home and tells his mum he was looking at porn at school.

The parent phoned the school and was put through to me. I do not mind taking a call of this nature as I can tell them the exact situation.

I was 'told' by the parent that the school she worked for never faced this kind of trouble and our filtering was not good enough and we should do more to protect the innocent children from the images. I told them that our school had the very strict LEA (Learning Authority) filtering enabled and then our own keyword/website filter built into the child's school assigned netbook so that in actuality our laptops were more 'locked down' internet wise than the ones her own class use at the school she worked at. Thankfully I knew this because our cluster of schools (a group of schools which link and share resources/training) did not have a full time technician, only employed LEA filtering and had no word monitors on computers. I rebutted to her 'our school does not have this problem' argument with 'Your school has this problem, you just aren't aware of it as your policies are more lax than ours'. She carried on wailing.

After some to and fro she asked why he was not monitored more closely in class. I told her that HE had reported it to his teacher as soon as it had come up on his screen as I can see from the policy central desktop capture logs. I also noted that the background of his netbook was an image from 'The Inbetweeners' and asked her if she was aware that her son was a fan of an adult themed programme. I was told that was 'different'.

&gt;Combine that with the cracks in time to remove her existence from his memories after building up emotion and you have a super sad season ending moment where she is 'trapped because of the doctor's anger leading him to do something rash and the crack gets her' 

&gt;He forgets her, continues on to save the day and you have a man who has 'killed' his love/she sacrificed herself, been super fucking sad about it, forgot it, and can never remember her even existing as time is re-written around him.

a cruel fate eh?

&gt;Season ends with the doc looking down to find the blue book that looks surprisingly like a tardis (which he'll give to her in the first place - mark my words), staring at it as though it means something before tossing it aside. 

Super off topic prediction: ""spacesuit"" is the doctor who kills himself (maybe a flesh self) for as yet unknown reasons.

The Doctor making a mistake (or playing along, perhaps), failing to recover the child and getting a few friends killed is not ideal, but in a war that's little more than a setback. 

You may have noticed the look Father Octavian gives the Doctor during the ""things you never put in a trap"" scene: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkcagXkFCis

He knows there's more to that speech than threatening the Angels. Octavian refers to a very specific portion of the life of Augustus, most notably his time in the second triumvirate formed to defeat Caesar's assassins and consolidate power.

Rory tells ""Cleopatra"" that the Roman costume was the Doctor's idea. I agree that there's a yet-unseen mover behind all this, and I think the Doctor brought back the Last Centurion to say something to them. Perhaps ""The one you sent against me is my general?"" Telling them he knows Rory has been tampered with, or will be? Not sure yet. The Holy Roman Empire was the first reich, so ""Let's kill Hitler"" is a terribly interesting place to take this set of references, especially given that the Doctor met his favorite former time agent in WWII.

I also said you were a lot of stuck up twats who don't even understand the basic the basic concept of ""perpective"".

You're overly emotional, easily enraged and dare I say you are acting out the national stereotype: Easily irked tightfisted people who gets pissed off about small thing.

To say the buses in this city ""aren't great"" is like saying that Nick Griffin is a tad extreme in his views. The buses would be better if they weren't the main form of public transit in this city. It's quicker to *cycle* in Edinburgh than take the bus. It's quicker for me to take a train to Dunfermline than take a bus into Edinburgh. Every time I go to another city, I feel like I've travelled 20 years into the future and every time I come back I feel like I've gone 20 years into the past. I agree, the tram project has crashed and burnt, we're beating a dead horse on that front. We're past the point where most Edinburgers would glady vote to stop the tram project and indeed ban all future light right projects. But the simple fact that almost **everyone** is ignoring with all their might is that the public transport in Edinburgh is shite! In fact I'd go as far to say that it's the worst of major city in the UK. Not because of the tram project, but because we've been fucked by the beaching cuts and we've put way to much emphasis on the buses! We need rapid transit! Note how I said ""Rapid transit"". Sadly, most people won't admit this, they're too busy wanking off to bus porn. 

We haven't got the financial, political or civil will to do anything about this. Even if we did, it's too late, we should've dealt with this twenty years ago. Our transport will *always* be shit, because nobody wants to admit we have a problem (and it's not because of the fucking trams).

But you know who's been making shit-tonnes of money of this. The EEN! They're laughing all the way to the bank, they've been riding this circlejerk by putting sensationalist headlines about...well anything! They treated a plan to Write ""Faité gu Dunn Edinn"" on the ""welcome to Edinburgh"" sign exactly like they did with the tram project!

Edinburgh is a stuck up city where everyone has their heads stuck up their own arses on almost every single issue from the trams to potholes.

Every time an issue comes up, this city goes into a massive circle jerk usually fueled by the edinburgh evening news, where nothing is said or done that is of any value.

Take the tram project. It's crashed and burned all due to the council getting the cowboys in. Now almost everyone is demanding that we scrap the tram project and...well...people are a bit hazy about what to do afterwards. In fact the most coherent thing I have heard so far is ""more buses"", which will do nothing to help develop decent quick public transport in this city. Nobody wants to accept that we rely almost totally on buses to do a job they aren't meant to be used for (as the main form of transit in a medium size city) and they don't want to admit that they are so slow that they are actually better off cycling then taking the bus.

Meanwhile the Council genuinely do not know what to do. They do not want to be left with a half done tram project but they know it's crashed and burnt beyond all repair. They also know that our transport system is in dire need of an upgrade and it can't be done with more buses. The proper thing to do would be to scrap the tram project and perhaps restart another project, be it a tram project or something else because the fact of the matter is: Edinburgh, unlike Glasgow, Newcastle or...well, pick a city, has no real way to get A to B in a short, quick period of time. That's what the Trams were supposed to be, sadly, they have failed.

But of course, that will never happen. We haven't got the political, financial or civil will and we won't for a long time. All we have are circlejerks getting us nowhere on a variety of issues.

Edinburgh is a city run by fools, who were voted in by idiots being trolled into rages by a tabloid where information takes a backseat to sensationalism and money.

If I could, I would leave and never come back. And I guess that's why I came to reddit. I can ignore (/r/)Edinburgh on reddit. But I came on here to tell you lot how stupidly enraging you lot are.

Little old dears with passwords stuck to their screens in full view of the everyone, unlimited potential for social engineering, clinicians leaving PCs unlocked and logged into clinical systems and the spine while patients are alone in their room.

I've been into surgeries which have live network points in the waiting room ffs.

At best they pay lip-service to data security. Every member of staff is required to take IG (information governance) training annually but it's a multiple-choice test with unlimited retries until you score over 80%. Even then the test is pretty thin on computer-based security (it's mostly about record keeping and handling FOI requests).

Anyway, my point is any data uploaded to SCR would have been bulletproof by comparison - when the great NHS data-leak comes (and frankly it's overdue) it's going to be the result of someone walking into a GP surgery and filling their pockets.

I'll try and think of some canon sources for this. For all the other languages though, the TARDIS usually kicks in for translation, no matter where in time and space it is, relative to its companions. They usually retain the translation power – it's a psychic link. The Doctor definitely has greater access to this power though, by his biology or tinkering. The TARDIS was old by the time he took it, so I doubt it has anything to do with the briode nebulizer imprint. Perhaps just an expression of their intense symbiotic relationship?

As for speaking languages, the Doctor probably first learned Modern Gallifreyan, but he has also shown a proficiency in English, Judoon and a form of Martian. Notably, he doesn't understand French in The War Games, but he can in later episodes.

No question that's a reference to the play and the theme of striking down a beloved friend in fear of his expanding power is central to the play and S6 so far.

Maybe the fall of the Silence is the Doctor's fall as well, when he realizes that he put them there to help? The line in *Julius Caesar* is usually truncated when it's quoted. The entire line is **""Et tu, Brute! Then fall, Caesar.""**

Your insight has made me a bit more optimistic that the Doctor will escape the death on the beach. Tragedies are about mistakes/fatal flaws and epiphanies, not unavoidable catastrophes. 

That means his life is in Amy's hands, just as he said. Had he not known ""what he must know"" (that she was pregnant) he probably wouldn't have detected Doppelflesher Amy. If he doesn't know ""what he must never know"" (his death), he can't outmaneuver his foes and I don't think what Amy let slip in the Flesh episode will be enough. If that ends up being true, add one to the ""Silence are creepy but awesome... unfortunately they were hunted into extinction"" tally. 

""Can't tell him his future and he wouldn't want to know"" is a rather weak argument -- he pops in to tell himself his future a few times per season. Pretty sure the Destroyer of Worlds can handle a little intel about his own death, so that seems like River trying to keep him in the dark... but maybe she has a Doctor death-avoidance plan of her own? I am most suspicious of things that seem obvious this season.

Is it September yet??

There are two gay couples in this episode, one male and one female. The male gay couple refer to themselves as 'The fat one and the thin one', referencing a common stereotype that all gay men are obsessed with their appearance. This is further exploited when the 'fat' one is killed off, symbolizing how all gays have to have perfect bodies. [Mind you, my bf did use to be obese, so that's a touchy subject for him. Also, this wasn't in the text](/spoiler) Furthermore, they're the only characters that remain un-named through the episode, symbolizing how they're not as good as everyone else. The lesbians basically enforce the stereotype that all lesbians are butch dykes who enjoy fighting. Not only that, but the fact that one of them is a lizard just denotes homosexuality to be in the same category as bestiality. Thirdly, the fact that the lizard couldn't tell if some humans were male or female both symbolizes how all homosexuals are promiscuous, and also how gay people can alter themselves by being with members of the opposite sex. Not only that, but they fall into Moffat's chauvinistic sexism, as once again we are presented with unrealistic 'superwomen' that end up following male orders (ala Sally Sparrow, River Song, Amy Pond, etc)

Oh really? Go back and read the very first thing I said in this discussion: *""Thorium hopefully isn't far off though""*... So either you can't read well enough to understand my position, or you have projected an imaginary opponent with imaginary views onto me for you to argue against because you are a crazy person.

As soon as I said ""Thorium hopefully isn't far off though"", you launch into Renewable energy vs [modern] nuclear energy, and every argument you have posted since then assumes that I'm an advocate for the nuclear industry and that I somehow hate solar panels and wind turbines. I can't believe that i have to explicitly state (again) that this is not the case.

My position is that renewable energy is fine, but that Thorium is going to secure our long term energy and environmental future, and that it is quite close to being reality. I also think that it is going to be better, cheaper, cleaner, smaller and safer than modern nuclear, because I actually understand how it is different from modern nuclear, wheras you in your own words don't see a difference *""B = nukes (of all flavours)""*.

&gt;Evidence? No. Just more empty words, hopes and dreams. You seem to have trouble separating those things from reality - a common affliction with the thorium fan club.

Evidence? 3 nuclear scientists and a guy from NASA... i.e. the videos I posted which you didn't watch. And spare me the 'youtube isn't a reliable source' bullshit, they're videos of seminars by actual qualified scientists, not a vlog by a sci-fi writer.

&gt;Another sign of a pissant: can't debate the issue, so tries to distract with accusations about the opponent that might have happened somewhere else at some other time. Pathetic.

Your responses in this thread alone is enough for me to see that you're not in touch with reality, being as your responses usually don't have anything to do with what I've posted.

true,insllvn,null,null,"&gt;The male gay couple refer to themselves as 'The fat one and the thin one', referencing a common stereotype that all gay men are obsessed with their appearance.

Then why would one be fat?

&gt;This is further exploited when the 'fat' one is killed off, symbolizing how all gays have to have perfect bodies.

Right, the stereotype that all gay men have good bodies because those that don't are quickly selected for beheading by mysterious space cults, I forgot about that. Did it not strike you as subtle irony that the one happy-go-lucky church marine was selected for conversion? Despite his positive nature and devotion to the cause, he was worthless to the Church. On whom does that reflect badly?

&gt;Furthermore, they're the only characters that remain un-named through the episode, symbolizing how they're not as good as everyone else.

They are also the only nice marines except for that one woman from the gamma forests, but yeah that throw away line about not needing names was probably about grinding down the gays. Oh, and there are a host of other nameless red shirts, and at least one other character known by a title instead of a name. 

&gt;The lesbians basically enforce the stereotype that all lesbians are butch dykes who enjoy fighting.

They came off as butch? Seriously? What branch of butch do the well kept Victorian samurai fall in? Oh, and ""the Lesbians"" is it now? Takes too long to type out Madame Vastra and Jenny, despite an earlier point hanging on the nameless dismissal of homosexual men, I suppose. I guess, in the context of the plot, it would have been better for the Doctor to collect a beautiful and demure pair of thoroughly non-stereotypical lesbians, whatever the hell that would even mean, to go assault the Church's secrete asteroid. Oh, and it bears mentioning that if the warrior lesbians are a stereotype, then the gay marines from earlier are subverting a stereotype by being tough marines and warriors in god's army. 

&gt;Not only that, but the fact that one of them is a lizard just denotes homosexuality to be in the same category as bestiality.

Fucking speciest. We don't refrain from fucking animals because different cell structures are icky, we don't fuck them because they cannot communicate or understand consent. It's like how we don't fuck children; it's all about consent. There will come a day, and I am eager for it, when calling a loving relationship between members of two different species bestiality will be considered as abhorrent as comparing interracial or homosexual relationships to pederasty. There is no room for bronze age bigotry and ignorance in the space future. 

&gt;Thirdly, the fact that the lizard couldn't tell if some humans were male or female both symbolizes how all homosexuals are promiscuous, and also how gay people can alter themselves by being with members of the opposite sex.

That is a recurring joke throughout the series that is supposed to play on the very real phenomenon that people have greater difficulty differentiating people of other races. Put less politically correctly, the all-Chinese-people-look-the-same phenomenon. Without that gag carrying over, we would have nothing but suggestive looks and a tongue gag to tell us that Madame Vastra and Jenny were more than companions. 

&gt;Not only that, but they fall into Moffat's chauvinistic sexism, as once again we are presented with unrealistic 'superwomen' that end up following male orders (ala Sally Sparrow, River Song, Amy Pond, etc)

You mean following the Doctor's orders? Yeah, why would any strong, confident woman take instructions from a thousand year old time traveling genius who was risking his life and pulling out all the stops to rescue a friend? Must be secret chauvinism. I suppose he was busy composing this gem of a rant while they explained that the Doctor was collecting people who owed him favors. 

What really upsets me about this rant is that I often come across such screeds condemning anti-gay sentiment and they all sound the same. They all take the unspoken position that a single stereotype confirmed is a grave transgression. The unstated alternative they yearn for is a world where media exists to challenge and subvert stereotypes, in essence that any media that is not a gay fairy tale about how everyone is a unique snowflake (so long as the shape of that snowflake doesn't resemble any of the names the jocks called me in high school) is an attack on the community and a sign of militant heteronormativism. It all boils down to ""the gays aren't acting right!"" and that's bullshit. People act all sorts of ways, and some of them line up with stereotypes. The straight white men didn't all get together in a secret straight-white-men meeting to assign random behavior traits to the subhuman masses. They have become memetic because they were observed repeatedly. No one complains of the wise old man with the long white beard, yet old people are often slow witted, senile, bigoted and short tempered. It would paralyze a team of writers and kill the series if people like that were permitted to screen scripts for unacceptable content. Anyone who plays the part of the villain cannot display a single recognizable trait, or else we are slighting the group who define themselves by that trait. I guess we just stick with Daleks until waste bins complain. I guess my point is stop defining yourself as a single trait. Think of my favorite homosexual character from Moffet's tenure, Canton Everett Delaware III. Canton embodies the American aesthetic. Quiet and reserved, he does not shy from violence, but he will listen to reason. Canton bucks authority and wears his antiestablishmentarianism as a badge of honor, even thanking the president for recognizing that Canton is his own man. He adapts quickly to the idea of space and time travel and video phones, this is a clever fellow. Canton is also terribly brave. He stays behind in his own time, limited by its moors and attitudes while he watches the Doctor disappear into the endless possibilities of time. He stays because there is work to be done and he is the man to do it. Canton is a hero. Those are the things about Canton that matter, the things he chooses and endeavors to be. 

EDIT: Oh, and another thing: How can he stand Torchwood if he complains about the Silurians difficulty in distinguishing gender representing the mean and hateful notion that sexual orientation is fluid? Captain Jack is a man from the omnisexual future. He is fucking described, in the RTD years no less, as a man from a time when notions of gender and attraction are more fluid. That is the thesis of Captain Jack, that sex is excellent and without bigotry we would want to have it with everything.

11 Midfielders including wings for 4 positions. With kuyt and pacheco being able to play in wing positions that is potentially 13 players for 4 positions.

Constitutional Monarchy is the modern kind of monarchy. 

Monarchs serve as the head of state of a country. That means they have a legitimate ceremonial and political role. This separates the head of state from the head of government (the Prime Minister) who actually runs the country and is a politician.

Constitutional monarchy is the most stable form of government in the world because it limits the governments power.

If you actually look at nations which have constitutional monarchies and compare them to republics you can see that the monarchies are more democratic and fairer than the republics.

The United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Denmark, Sweden, Netherlands, Norway, Luxembourg and Japan are all constitutional monarchies and have some of the best standards of living for their citizens and the lowest corruption in their government.

7 of the 10 most democratic and corruption free nations are constitutional monarchies and most republics suffer from internal strife and corruption.

The fact is more and more political scientists are starting to consider Republics as a archaic form of government. They just do not offer the same benefits to their citizens that a constutional monarchy does and they are usually more undemocratic.",0,1307813840,null,0,false,0,c1z41e0,t3_hvfwq,t1_c1z41e0,t3_hvfwq,1427235338,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

 Note: RD=Real Doctor GD=Ganger Doctor SS=Sonic Screwdriver


 * RD uses SS to lock wall grate
 
 * In control room with both doctors RD on left holding SS GD on right with motherboard in front of him
 
 * NOTE: switch of shoes happens behind consol and at this point they make the RD go sit on a barrel (a nice barrel too).
 
 * GD scans Cleeves while sitting in chair then passes SS to RD telling him to go with Buzz to search for Rory. (i speculate that the RD gave the GD his sonic during the switch and then the GD passed it back to him when the RD went with Buzz)

 * RD has SS when he gets knocked out by Buzz (who think he is the ganger)

 * **here is where we find out there are 2 SS**....

 * GD has SS when group is locked in acid pool room. RD is locked away with the other gangers at this point and they think he is the ganger doctor as well.

 * Group reunites RD waits under falling Tardis and GD by the door of room.

 * RD passes GD the SS before leaving so that GD can decomission Gjen

 * RD in tardis decomissions Ganger Amy with another SS
 
 * **thi is where we find out there is a 3RD SS**

true,ax4of9,null,null,"I think this article has got it right on the nail. 

I have heard people questioning the neccessity of Henderson when the purchase was announced, but if the tactics here are right (and they seem spot on to me), it spells out how Liverpool will play next season. 

With left-back being the weak spot, they will probably buy a left-back with the emphasis on stability and defensive capabilities intead of offensive talent. This means that the left-winger will need to take up the bulk of attacking duties. Only an out-and-out winger can do that, which is why we're linked to the likes of Mata, Downing and Hazard. 

This leaves the rest of midfield being pretty fluid. If they play 1 DM in Lucas, 1 playmaker and 1 right midfielder linking the midfield with the strike force, this means that Gerrard, Henderson and Meireles can rotate among themselves for these 2 positions, since they seem to be pretty adept at this. Considering Henderson's youth and Gerrard's age (and injury problems), this looks to be the best solution. Jay Spearing in my opinion is being set up as sort of an understudy to Lucas. Which leaves Jonjo Shelvey as the back up in case of injury to one of the three offensive midfielders. 

The strike force will consist of Suarez, Carroll, Maxi and Kuyt. Maxi Rodriguez will be able to back up as a second striker or as a left midfielder, while Kuyt can do the same for the right. 

The level of transfer speculation seems to point towards Liverpool buying 2 left wingers and 1 extra striker. I find the rumours of 2 left wingers pretty unlikely (unless Downing really goes for cheap, which I find unthinkable considering the market for English players.) Liverpool needs 1 good left winger. It seems like Suso has a pretty wicked left foot and plenty of vision in his passing, so I would not be surprised if he sees a lot more playing time this year. Furthermore, with his age and talent he will be worth alot to Liverpool if properly developed. Qualifying for home-grown player status helps as well. 

I have not seen much of Connor Wickham to comment on that story, but 10 million for potential seem to be an okay buy, and the potential of recouping that money a few years down the road is pretty high. The strike force will also have Dani Pacheco as back-up, which is a pretty good alternative. 

At this point, I think that all Liverpool needs is a world-class left winger, a steady left-back, and at most a good understudy for centre-back. If Pool can keep playing at the same style as they were during the end of last season, there will be plenty of improvement next season, though a title challenge might be too soon to tell. 

PS. I thought that Liverpool was not really trying in their last 2 matches. I have a feeling Dalglish was trying to avoid the Europa League, as it would have required more depth than Liverpool has, and ultimately end up as distraction from the main goal of getting a Champion's League place next season.

This is the first entire 4th Doctor serial I've watched (I saw half of an abridged version of Pyramids of Mars last year).

**Story:** I don't know how much of what I was enjoying was the work of Douglas Adams rather than Tom Baker. It was a good mix of interesting sci-fi concept and general detective story. Much better paced than older serials.

**Doctor:** Definitely good fun to watch, but this story doesn't show him as being leaps and bounds ahead of the others. 

**Companions:** Romana wasn't quite as inspiring as I'd expected. Apart from the mildly amusing conversations in the first few scenes, she was just a less exciting version of Jo. Although if this had been a Second or Third Doctor story his companion would have been threatened to force the Doctor to do Scaroth's bidding, rather than tricking Romana.
Duggan was amusing, as was the Doctor's continuing exasperation with his methods. Pre-empting Ace somewhat?

**Big Bad:** Good acting, dodgy alien costume, but better than some of the modern ones even. Good motivation, but quite similar to the BFA: *The Spectre of Lanyon Moor*. Obviously this serial predated that audioplay, but having heard that first, this felt a little played out.",0,1307830189,null,0,false,0,c1z5eey,t3_hwxso,t1_c1z5eey,t1_c1z4rx4,1427235988,2,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,2

true,CptBoots,tom-baker,Tom Baker,"I start with the beginning. However you can look [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Doctor_Who_serials) and see which arcs have missing video ect. I love the early doctors a lot more than any of the new ones. Though don't get me wrong it's a new and good show now a days, but the old one has so much social awareness that it's bold and refreshing, but at the same time often really subtle about it. Mostly about free love, and the evils of using religion to mislead people, and more often than not as they got towards the 70's nuclear disarmament and environmental movements. Sarah Jane Smith, in 1974 introduces the strongest feminist element I've yet to see on the show.  I'm not pushing these beliefs on you or anything however, I am stating that if you want to watch a more socially conscious show start right where you are. But if you also want to do that but want to not worry about missing video or audio or sound-board recreations or whatever. Start with the early 70's. 

The first season which you just downloaded is awesome. 'An Unearthly Child' is just a great beginning for the doctor. I like watching his personality evolve, and the idea of the doctor take over as what we know it today over time. It's funny to think that all this was possible thanks to a quick decision on the developmental staff about 'regeneration' being an answer to a show that outlives it's casts interest or careers. I'm said a lot here but mainly I want you to know I think the earliest shows are worth watching but I'm a huge nerd. I'd atleast watch some of every doctor. I did love 1, and 2, and 3, and am currently loving 4 as I watch through. I use dailymotion as I mentioned before.

There are 4 general schools of thought that are popular in this order:

* Start with Eccleston (2005) (New Series, not a complete reboot, but the show had been off the air for 16 years, so no assumption is made that viewer knows wtf is going on)

* Start with Matt Smith (2010) (New Doctor, new show runner. Get caught up quickly with the rest of us and go crazy guessing what happens next.)


* Start with Tom Baker or Jon Pertwee (1970s ""Golden Age"")

* Start at the beginning (Completists who have a compulsive need to watch the whole thing from the beginning.)

There are others, but those are the ones you see in here the most.

Do you like black and white television from the 1960s with low/no budget effects? The early days are very much of their time.

Doctor Who is all about the concepts, especially classic Who. If you like the ideas behind it in general, you will find things you really like and things that you don't and things that make you question most of reality. In my opinion, all of it is good, but I started watching as a kid, and I started with Tom Baker/Peter Davison in the mid-80s, and I would say unless you march to the beat of a really masochistic drummer, you might want to ease yourself into Doctor Who with something a *bit* more exciting than the 1963-present viewing order. But, since you've got it, go ahead and watch the first episode. After you watch that maybe watch Rose (2005), or The Eleventh Hour (2010) to get a perspective of how much the show evolves and changes to today. Might help your understanding as you get acquainted with the show.Personally, if I had it to do again, I'd take advantage of the vast amount of material, hit the highlights.  Then get caught up to the current season if I liked the highlights and then go back and actually fill in the gaps. By then you basically have a new hobby. 

So, in short, take whichever path seems to make sense to you and climb aboard the TARDIS for a while. You will definitely go to times and places no other show can match. If you like that sort of thing.

FWIW the first story I watched wasn't much of an auspicious starting point. It was the Tom Baker story Pyramids of Mars (1975) and isn't much of starting point. And I fell in love with the show in 5 minutes. Then again, I was 6.

Will the Doctor orchestrate the imprisonment of River by Father Octavian/the Clerics?     

I think Rory's Last Centurion could be based, at least partially, on Cassius Scaeva. He is known for defending his post against terrible odds and he was a centurion. IIRC he was even in Gaul with Caesar, though that is not where he made the stand that history remembers him for. 
http://www.ancientlibrary.com/smith-bio/3064.html  
http://classics.mit.edu/Plutarch/caesar.html

Beyond the historical parallels, Rory wanted to be a doctor and became a nurse because Amy admired the Raggedy Doctor. He's now running around dressed like a soldier from ""The greatest military machine in the history of the Universe."" Healer to warrior.

I think Rory's development is partially intended to underscore the Doctor's healer/warrior tension. The Doctor always grabbed someone's hand when he told them to run. Now he's telling thousands to run in fear even as a forgotten girl who ran with him is killed trying to help him. The Doctor is also the last guardian of many things, has always said that fighting is a choice, and is comporting himself as a warrior rather than a healer.

Few more things  in there as well about The Last Centurion, such as 'extracts' from Samuel Pepys diary, as he and Rory were friends.

The text that goes with this poster says:

&gt; During the summer of 1934, residents of central London were inundated with a constant stream of leaflets adorned with the warriors face, and a curiously prescient message. Less than a fortnight after this spontaneous one-man campaign took place, Adolf Hitler awarded himself the title Head of State, and the Third Reich was formed. It is an unfortunate irony that the Constant Warrior was apparently destroyed by the enemy he had predicted and, after his apparent death during the height of the London Blitz, this cultural icon faded into legend. Only [one final image survives](http://i.imgur.com/DKifR.jpg), and its veracity is questionable, but it appears to show the Warrior sacrificing himself to protect his prize from the burning skeleton of the warehouse in which the Pandorica was contained.

true,Charlie24601,tardis,TARDIS,"I think that general idea is grasping at straws at this point.

I think its pretty clear that the Doctor has ups and downs.  Sometimes the good shows through, sometimes the evil.  We've seen that through the ages, not just in 9, 10 and 11.  So this is nothing new at all.

What IS new, and what AGMGTW made very clear is we are seeing the Doctor at his highest, and now he is going to fall father than he has ever fallen before.

I don't think this fall will be about mental anguish, or depression, or anything like that.

I think we're about to see the Doctor fall into a real 'evil' point.  

Maybe not wholly evil per se, but just something entirely badass and callous.

I'm envisioning something along the lines of ""The Family of Blood"" (he was protecting us...from himself) and ""The Waters of Mars"" (I am the guardian of the laws of Time, AND THEY WILL OBEY ME!).

I'm thinking we're about to see the *beginning* of this war against him that they talk about....how he truly brings it on.  

It's not all the posturing and whatnot we've seen before (Basically...run!).  It's exactly what River warns him about:  How Doctor on the other planet means warrior...not healer.  what happens if the word Doctor becomes synonymous with an entirely different meaning than on earth?

true,DrBobert,pertwee,Pertwee,"Are you kidding me?

First of all, it's an intensely personal small story. The stakes, unlike the recent series and the need for HOLY CRAP THE UNIVERSE MUST BE SAVED, are deeply personal. The Doctor has to save Peri. Not the Universe, not Earth, not anything grand, but the woman who he met the previous story.

Second, Davison has never been better. He is at his absolute pinnacle, and the Fifth Doctor's more human side really shines through. He is at once afraid and unsure of himself yet armed with a plan. He's improvising, yet knows what he's doing. He's angry and yet retains compassion for Peri and even towards Jek.

Third, the end of the third part. You may not have caught it, but there is a point where the Doctor FIGHTS OFF REGENERATION so he can save Peri's life. And they don't even mention it. It's written superbly that if you see it and recognize it, the stakes get a little higher. The Doctor is running the risk of not regenerating again so he can save Peri. Again, this is a woman who he's only just met.

Fourth, the acting and production is amazing. I know in comparison to the new series it looks dated and the performances don't feel 'authentic'. But everyone is on their A-Game here, and Graeme Harper's direction is truly inspired. Like I mentioned, the scene where Five fights of the regeneration is a great example of this.

Lastly, it has one of the strangest regenerations ever. The Doctor, finally succumbing to the inevitable sees the companions who joined him on his journeys and then the Master. It's his inner dialogue telling him to keep going, and yet he has that side to him that wants to give up and just die, as personified by the Master. And then *BAM* Colin Baker, probably the one Doctor who has inspired more heated passions than any other. And what a line to start a reign with:

'Change, Peri. And not a moment too soon.'

Cut to credits.

I love it. It deserves to be the number one story. If you want to find the seeds of the new series, you'll find them here. A more emotional Doctor fighting like never before to save his friend's life. And not even a friend he has known for too long. It shows how big a heart(s) he has towards those who risk travelling with him.

Cultural Marxism, also known as Political Correctness, is an ideology and a strategy used to socially engineer the society through the subversion of culture. Political Correctness and Multiculturalism are tools used today to undermine and destroy western culture in order then to replace it with a radically different one based on collectivist lines. These techniques are broadly based on the teachings of the Frankfurt School, first based in Frankfurt, Germany, and then spread to New York and in the rest of the world. The Soviets, communists and socialists worldwide used these techniques in order to undermine the culture and the institutions of western nations and so bring them under their control. Political Corectness is not a phenomenon that should be underestimated. It is the root of all evil and is destroying slowly our societies and civilization.

The Silents erase your memory so you don't remember them. Even though they are evil (and apparently I'm in the minority on that opinion), you don't remember it so they're not so creepy. 

The Flesh are just clones and I don't find that creepy at all. Yeah Jennifer went a little crazy, but that's because she remembered every one of her deaths so it's hard not to blame her for that. The other gangers were just regular people. 

The Weeping Angels are scary to look at, move in the blink of an eye, and can destroy your whole future.

imo, this pretty much sums it up.  10 actually let his anger loose and did terrifying things; 11's rage so far has been pretty impotent.

sure, he's made some pretty impressive speeches, and yeah, he chased the army off of the asteroid base by rounding up an army of old friends, but what has he actually *done*?  10 flat-out *killed* someone in his first episode, stating ""no second chances.  i'm that sort of a man.""

the way i see it, though, it's not ""better"" and ""worse"" writing.  i think it's done intentionally to show how the doctor has changed over the years since the time war ended.  he doesn't *want* to kill anymore; he avoids it at all costs, preferring instead to scare his enemies away using his reputation.  he wants to escape his past (""you want to be forgiven.""

This was true all the way back to Hartnell but was rarely recognized on-screen.

Also, when he says ""They're always brave.""  He's referring to all the past companions who have died or risked their lives for him.  I think of Adric especially.  And of course this harkens back to what Davros said, about how the Doctor turns his companions into weapons to do his dirty work...

It's why they have a voice over mentioning an imaginary friend, but then quickly cut to other figures in shadows so you cannot see who specifically the voice is talking about. Then they cut to a description of the Tardis and other elements of the universe with various quotes from unidentified people. (IE most of the quotes are voice overs. You don't see them stated by an actor. Nobody says ""Doctor"" with a cut to 9 or 10 saying ""yes?"". Nor does any of the Doctors say ""I'm the Doctor"")

That's why they cut to black with a voice over (at 1:10) and describe the Doctor outright. It holds so the audience gets more of the sense of the Doctor as a force than a character played by an actor.

* Calling back the Atraxi to threaten them in The 11th Hour
 
* His fury at Amy in The Beast Below for choosing for him (by not telling him about the whale), and also his fury/sadness at having to give the star whale a lobotomy.
 
* His anger at the Daleks in The Victory of the Daleks for not recognizing him, and then his command to the Spitfires to destroy the Dalek ship.
 
* He destroys the last of the Saturnyne in Vampires of Venice
 
* In Amy's Choice you have the alter-ego of the Doctor in the Dreamlord, who is entirely frightening and does act. 
 
* In The Hungry Earth/Cold Blood two parter he's furious at both sides for the violence they've committed to each other.
 
* Then you've got his fury directed against all his previous nemesis' in The Pandorica Opens, which is a brilliant scene.
 
* In The Impossible Astronaut he's got a cold anger against the crew for not telling him what's going on. 
 
* The Doctor's Wife showed him again in a cold anger against House for giving the TARDIS life and then callously destroying it. 
 
* The Rebel Flesh showed him at maybe his angriest in the entire series--first at Amy for not telling him about his death, then at humanity for not hearing or caring about the deaths of the Flesh.
 
* Then you come to A Good Man Goes to War which is the culmination of all his anger. The scene with Colonel Runaway is terrifying, his interaction with Madame Kovarian also showcases his anger at a near boiling point. When River shows up his anger switches to cold again because he feels as though he's been betrayed. You've also got him destroying an entire fleet of Cybermen just to make a point.

I really don't know why you think that the Doctor needs to destroy an entire race to showcase anger, because Smith has done it much better than Tennant ever did (except in Family of Blood which is perhaps his best acting of his entire run). 

It's easy to be loud and noisy and break things when you're angry. That's what my 3 year old son does when he's upset at me. It's far more chilling to have someone look you dead in the eyes and threaten the fires of heaven on you for messing with the people you love. 

For me the difference between 10 and 11 is not the level of anger they get to, but in the way it's expressed. 10 is much more expressive with it, to the point of almost being a caricature. 11 is very contained with his emotions, whatever they are. He keeps his sorrows to himself and mostly his anger as well, but those few moments when the anger slips are absolutely terrifying.

But it **was** his darkest hour. The Doctor's whole point in life was to be a fixer of things. A healer, a companion, a madman with a box who solved problems. Then in the control room of Demon's Run a Silurian made him realize that he'd turned into the complete opposite of what he'd intended to be.

His name had become so known throughout the universe that armies ran in fear. His name had become so feared that his enemies were willing to travel through time and kidnap the child of his best friends to turn her into a weapon to be used against him. Instead of being about the triumph of intellect and romance, he became about brute force and cynicism (tip of the hat to Craig Ferguson there).

In other words the exact opposite of what he'd meant to be. This was further clarified by River when she showed up. The look of haunted despair on the Doctor's face when he realized what he'd become was shocking and it showed how far he'd fallen. 

I don't get what people want from that episode. Do they want him marched off in chains to show how far he's fallen? He got Strax, Lorna, and Doriam killed. He summoned an army to capture Demon's Run but it was all for nought. He allowed himself to get so angry at Madame Kovarian that he wasn't thinking straight and got fooled twice by the same trick.

Point B.)

That's what this is, and that's what the whole point of this episode was. It was about building up the Doctor to be this sort of godlike being who can do anything he wants just by mentioning his name and then slamming him back down. I thought it did that brilliantly, because it's all about how the Doctor sees himself, and all about internal forces, not external.

That's why the scene in the control room was so brief, because A.) The Doctor by nature is not a reflective person, and B.) He had major pressing concerns to attend to. Once those were done he was diverted again from further reflection by whatever news it was that River brought to him. 

Ten was very external in what he did and how he acted. Eleven is much more internalized. ",0,1307951591,null,0,false,0,c1ze2ls,t3_hy68j,t1_c1ze2ls,t1_c1ze1m4,1427240137,5,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,5

true,goober12,null,null,"&gt; Apparently the doctor, who knew nothing of the prayer leaf fully understood what was going on seeing only one side of it.

The Doctor has been to the Gamma Forests before, so he could well be familiar with their prayer-leaf customs.  Not to mention that he looked down at the cot, and saw a baby with a piece of cloth next to it that said ""River"", right after River said that she has seen the cot before, and that the answer to who she is is in the cot...  

That really doesn't seem like much of stretch to me, even if you assume he doesn't know about the prayer leaf customs.  

As for River blaming the doctor for the way the battle ended, this will *definitely* be cleared up in the upcoming episodes.  The doctor has ""fallen"" somehow, which could be connected to his failure to rescue Melody, but I think it has more to do with his having become a warrior/weapon (which is mentioned several times in the episode).  

As for River knowing everything about what happened, that's easily explained as well.  This is her past (she's the baby), and she knows the doctor from his future (after he had experienced these things).  She also spent time with Mme. Kovarian (or however you spell that), who knows everything about what happened.

As said before the main clubs are Syndicate, Dojos, Thekla, Lizard Lounge, Bunker, Motion, Bristol Academy, Oceana and Panache. 

Syndicate/Oceana/Panache - Mainstream, Dance, Rnb, Pop, Classics etc
Thekla/Bristol Academy/Motion/Dojos - Indie, Rock, Dubstep, Drum&amp;Bass, Electronic etc
Bunker/Lizard Lounge - Pretty much a mix of everything - main student club 

If you want something a bit more out of the ordinary theres a lot of clubs in stokes croft/edge of town area that cater to the more obscure, rave/mixed cultures scene. 

If you want more of a chilled night out, going to some bars etc then theres A LOT to choose from. Personally I spent most of my time around the Whiteladies/Triangle/Park Street area (My favourite part of bristol) where there is A LOT of awesome bars and restaurants including Bunker, Dojos, Lizard Lounge, Java, Po Na Na's and Mbargos (which is awesome if you want a bar/club/party kind of atmosphere! bit of everything basically!)

I would recommend hitting the Triangle/Whiteladies/Park street area when you first get there as there a lot to do, a lot of people around having a good time there and it's a very easy area to navigate, find somewhere to go etc!

I agree, then, that it would be tricky for Moffat to just retcon out major players in the story. But I could see him retconning out — to pick a popular one — the supposed limit on regenerations. It serves no story purpose, adds no drama. The only reason the Doctor regenerates at all is to facilitate recasting, and *that's* something they *have* to do unless they want to just end the story completely.

Now, on that point, if this were Moffat's story, I could totally see him ending it on his terms.

true,Hapax_Legoman,null,null,"I think there are two problems with Logopolis, as a plot device. First, it's been done. Second, the big blue box is more essential to ""Doctor Who"" than anything else. The theme tune changes, the cast changes, the writers change, the look of the show changes, the basic storytelling structure changes … the big blue box stays. You don't *want* to change the big blue box. So giving the Doctor any motivation to fix the chameleon circuit, or presenting him with any opportunity to do so, just writes you into a corner you have to write yourself back out of.

I look at regeneration the way I look at the sonic screwdriver. It's a plot device. You need it to be able to write stories. The audience buys into it as part of the whole magic-bean of the story, so as long as you don't call too much attention to it, it's fine.

Then again, maybe there's an opportunity there. I haven't heard anything about Matt Smith's tenure having a set end date, so I'm assuming he's on for at least one more series after the present one. So say he decides to move on after *that* one. Moffat writes a throwaway line into his last scene, just as he starts to regenerate. Maybe he looks down at his misty, glowing hands and holds back a tear, muttering, ""Oh, I'm going to miss this."" A little double-entendre: Is he going to miss being Eleven, or is he acknowledging his last regeneration?

Leave a hook, so they can use the end of Twelve's time as an opportunity to *really* shake things up, if they want.

""It's all over now, Little Sally. My time is done.""

""But Doctor, you can regenerate! Regenerate!""

""Long life, Little Sally, but not immortality. It's not a gift, but a loan. And the bill has come due at last."" A shuddering gasp. ""The Tardis will take you home after I'm gone.""

""But no! No!""

""Sally?""

A glimmer of hope. ""Yes, Doctor?""

""You … you …""

""Yes??""

""You were … magnificent.""

A last rattle. The light goes out in his eyes. A dead stare. Little Sally buries her face in his lapels and sobs. The camera pulls back … and back … before light, a universe of light, more blinding than ever, bursts from the cuffs and collar of the dead man. Sally is thrown back by the force of the eruption, stunned. She looks on in awe. The corpse is lifted from the floor into a mockery of a standing position like a marionette on strings, hanging unsupported, cruciform. The light is so bright, so violent, so … *terrifying.*

But finally, with the air of a tornado collapsing, it subsides. The new man settles onto his feet, head down, swaying slightly.

Little Sally finds her voice. ""D-D-D-Doctor? Is it you?""

He doesn't look up. Muttering, wordless at first, just sounds. Then we make it out, a sing-song whisper: ""Oh we're well off the edge of the map now, yes we are. We're deep in uncharted waters. What'll we find, what'll we find? Something new? Something very very old? Or will we fall right off the edge of the world?""

She crawls to her feet, approaches him the way you'd approach an unfamiliar dog. In a small voice: ""Doctor?""

His eyes snap to her like a predatory animal. Unblinking, blank-faced. And then … the grin. Mischievous, impish … malicious. *Terrifying.* Words like the growl of a woken lion: ""Here. Be. *Dragons.*""

Little Sally *screams.*

In ten or twenty years they'll probably move onto the topical science issue of the day, assuming we haven't all been drowned by rising sea levels. I really don't see the problem; ""classic"" science like gravity and oxidation (lol?) aren't compromised by topical issues.

However, my original take on it (which Moffet's subsequent tweets proved incorrect) was that when River pointed to the cot as proof of who she was... the Doctor knew it was his crib, that his name was on the side, that River knew his name, that she could read Galifreyan, and that he had a relationship with her.   

Therefore, they might have had a baby which would be a reason to pull his old crib out of storage... where even if he had never told her his name before, she'd have read it right off the crib.

Also, just having been in the crib herself wouldn't mean she'd know the Doctor's name, as most children can't read by the time they're out of an infant-sized crib.

However, it appears there is a possibility that the High Galifreyan writing on the side of the crib says, 'Galifrey Crib Co' or something else.

I can see what the Government is trying to do - they want the curriculum to be the core and allow the teachers to expand on that.

Will climate change still be on the lesson plan?

From my point of view, they are just exasperating the issue: Science is seen as dull and not related to real life. Students who go to university want to do a vocational subject rather than an academic one and so these get dropped at the first opportunity.

Why GPs, of all people? I want to hear one good reason why GPs are qualified or well-placed to handle the massively complex allocation of many billions of pounds. 

GPs already screwed the NHS over last year when they re-negotiated their contracts and got an absolutely ridiculous deal, and now the government wants to offer them even more over-payed work. Not only that, but they are easily open to bias, influence and subconscious prejudice when it comes to allocation of funds.

I've nothing against GPs, but they're not hospital doctors. If you want to give budgetary control to doctors (not necessarily a bad idea, but you have to remember a doctor is far more expensive than an administrator/accountant/manager etc) then it should be given to hospital consultant physicians.

true,[deleted],null,null,"If *you* think that only 11 is deserving of that name, *you* don't understand that name at all.

The ""Oncoming Storm"" is ""From the ancient legend of the Dalek homeworld"", Skaro. The first Doctor reignited the the war between the Daleks and the Thals between the Dalek prototypes Davros had left on the surface and what remained of their original mortal enemies, the Thals. (Which was arguably a good thing since when their more advanced brothers dug their way out the Kaled Elite compound at least the Thals knew something about them, but the point is the Doctor encouraged the Thals to fight to survive instead of run away. Well, actually Ian did.)

The Third Doctor buried an army of 10,000 Daleks under a glacier which disrupted their plans to invade an entire galaxy.

The Fourth Doctor interfered with their very origins, causing them to be sealed underground for possibly millennia. 

The Seventh Doctor programmed the Hand of Omega to completely destroy Skaro's entire solar system and stared Davros in the face as the planet was destroyed and the Hand made a trip back (also preprogramed by the Dcotor, one assumes.) to destroy Davros and his puppet race of cybernetic Daleks.

The Doctor sometimes has others fight for him and sometimes does his own dirty work, and wrestling with doing either both or neither has been a huge part of the franchise since *long* before Eccleston, Tennant and Smith. 

So, whatever his tactics, the Doctor as the Oncoming Storm was best described by a UNIT officer named Zebegniev in the Seventh Doctor story *Battlefield*: 

Zebegniev: ""When I served under Lethbridge-Stewart we had a scientific adviser called the Doctor.""

Bambera: ""The man outside?""

Z: ""No sir, but word was he could change his appearance and his personality, several times.""

B: ""How could he be the same man if his appearance and personality have changed?""

Z: ""I don't know, sir, but **whenever this Doctor shows up, all hell breaks loose.**""

No matter what his tactics, how he chooses to fight, have others fight for him, or run away, the Doctor is the Oncoming Storm, and always has been.

1) that the NHS will continue to oversee the health system .

2) that universal coverage - universal public insurance - will continue via the NHS .

3) that all practitioners will be paid on a per procedure basis . IE. fixed amount per procedure . EG. the doctor performs a checkup - he charges for a consultation . He takes out a surface lump - he charges for lump removal . He renews a prescription - he charges for prescription renewal .

4) that any patient can choose which practitioner they want to see . That the practitioner can also choose whether they want to take the patient on . Likewise - any patient can choose where they want treatment - what hospital etc. .

5) that all practitioners will operate as self employed - small business - people or as employed within other businesses .

6) that the level of bureaucracy will be minimised and kept as sensible and effective as possible .

7) that hospitals will be :-

i) passed off into county hands .

ii) sold to organisations such as church or fraternity based medical services - St. John of God etc. .

iii) sold to practitioners collectives .

iv) sold to private companies .

8) that the implementation and cost of all IT systems , as far as the overall specifications are concerned , will be specified and supervised and borne by the NHS . That the market will be opened up such that doctors can purchase software produced to the specifications from multiple vendors . Minimise the coverage of the specifications just to file formats , security - encryption etc. , keywords , data URL's etc. . Everything else - screen layouts , input \ output methods , features and options , etc. etc. etc. decided by the market . IE. keep it as loose and as open as possible.

No 8 year old time tots as shown in S3 either. And on a personal level, hell yeah because the Looms were a stupid ass concept.). DW is very much not a reboot and is very much a revival of the classic series. They have not once taken a shit on classic series continuity.

So, actually, it is a *huge* problem that the Wiki lumps it all together and confuses the shit out of fans who don't know the whole score.

The gist of it is that Tennant really benefitted by having Eccleston laying the groundwork, just like Smith benefitted by having Tennant to build off of (standing on the shoulders of giants and whatnot). Moffat and the Exec Produers decision to change *EVERYTHING* (Doctor, companion, TARDIS, sonic, creative team, and the feel of the show) was jarring to some fans who didn't have anything conveying consistency. They did it because they *could* (knowing new fans would be coming on who weren't familiar with any of the previous stuff) but it ended up having the opposite effect, alienating some current fans.

Plus 9's regeneration into 10 was handled well, with 9 explaining regeneration to Rose and saying how happy his is because he was so great. 10's regeneration into 11 is so bitchy that it ~~suggests~~ practically **screams** at the fans, ""you shouldn't want him to go either!""

Do they need the studio capacity, when they can lease studios from others (they all lease from each other anyway - ITV uses TV Centre, and the old Channel 4 Paul O'Grady Show came from there too) and they will have new capacity in Manchester (which, IMO, seems very pointless. London is the centre of the universe; why bother moving some efforts to a single city in the North? If they wanted to decentralise they should have done it country-wide).

In the 50s/60s (when TVC was considered/built) the equipment was such that you probably needed all those studios to make anything. These days, you don't. When did you last watch a drama programme, made recently, that wasn't made on location somewhere? Stuff like BBC News is going to move to new studios elsewhere in London.

Bear in mind that your analogy doesn't make sense. Many parts of the TV centre are listed and so wouldn't necessarily be knocked down / substantially modified - and it wouldn't surprise me if the Palace of Westminster is as protected as you can get. No way they'd get away with flattening it.

Also, a place like TV Centre is likely to be riddled with asbestos. That only makes using such an old building untenable. Want to lay cables or do some building work? It'll take many times longer and at much more expense while the professionals go in to clear the asbestos.

The point I was making is what they've shat on and what they have worked around or avoided stepping on completely backs the argument that if you *are* going to consider DW to have a canon (It's a personal choice, imo. I've seen and heard as much DW media as the next guy, if the next guy is also an obsessed Whovian.) then going with the classic tv stories, the new series and the bf audios (none of which shit on each others continuity, so far) is a good and sensible way to go about it and the wiki is a piece of shit because it should allow this choise to be made by clearlly delineating what happened in the tv stories and supportive media vs what was created under an uncaring BBC (they *really* didn't give a shit about DW from 1989-2005 and this is *why* they have to cop out and say there is no canon because of the butthurt people who liked (for reasons I cannot fathom even as a 25 year veteran of Whovianism) the NA and MA novels) vs what was created under the watchful eye of the BBC when it cared about its franchise.

edit- Yes, downvote me because you think that making clear what is popularly accepted vs what was written in a fanwanky dark time for the franchise on the first place people would go to get answers is a bad idea.

They did not control the weather and could not command the frosts to thaw or the monsoon rains to fall, so aside from mismanagement, I don't really see how you can hold an entire nation responsible for two tragic famines.

&gt; In my studies of the early Nazis, it's clear to see that the belief of Chritianity in the early 1900's created a lot of hate for the Jewish race.

Interesting, got any sources for this claim? Preferably a more neutral source than nobeliefs.org or atheism.com - an actual history website would be nice.

Hitler himself saw the Church as a tool, which is why he set up the [National Reich Church](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protestant_Reich_Church) as a tool of state. 

&gt;The National Reich Church of Germany categorically claims the exclusive right and the exclusive power to control all churches within the borders of the Reich: it declares these to be national churches of the German Reich. The National Church is determined to exterminate irrevocably...the strange and foreign Christian faiths imported into Germany in the ill-omened year 800 *(this is the year Charlemagne brought the german tribes in to Christendom - DrRedeye)*. The National Church has no scribes, pastors, chaplains or priests, but National Reich orators are to speak in them. The National Church demands immediate cessation of the publishing and dissemination of the Bible in Germany. On the altars there must be nothing but 'Mein Kampf' (to the German nation and therefore to God the most sacred book) and to the left of the altar a sword. On the day of its foundation, the Christian Cross must be removed from all churches, cathedrals and chapels...and it must be superseded by the only unconquerable symbol, the swastika.""

Over the years they have been home to some of the world's most famous TV programmes including Fawlty Towers, Monty Python's Flying Circus, Blue Peter, Absolutely Fabulous, The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy and classic Doctor Who. Since the early 1990s however the studios have been home to few dramas – the last major drama series to be shot there being The House of Eliott,[9] which ended in 1994, and the last single drama recorded was Henry IV, Part 1, in 1995.[10][11] This was because drama production moved almost entirely onto film or single-camera video, and Television Centre is a video-based, multi-camera production environment.[12]""

Syndicate/Oceana/Panache/ - Smart Shoes and a collared shirt (polo shirt ok). Mbargos/Lizard Lounge/Po Na Na's - Smart Shoes. Thekla/Bristol Academy/Motion/Lakota etc - Anything goes. Bunker- Pretty casual depending on if it's a student night.  

Most places you may have issues if it's a student night and you don't have a student I.D. Being that theres two uni's theres A LOT of nights and at least one every day a week so it's worth being aware. On the flip side of that nights that ARE student nights tend to be both considerably cheaper and more lively/friendly I found so it's worth it if possible!

All in all as the other replies have said it's pretty casual tho and if you look reasonable smart and not like a tramp you should be fine! I've gotten into most places wearing Converse rather than proper smart shoes but i do usually wear a shirt on a night out. Avoiding full on trainers is pretty much the only real rule. 

Syndicate is a good night out tho they often have guest dj's etc so can be more expensive, worth checking online beforehand!

Actually, while I'm here, I really have just rewatched TBB, and now have become seriously fascinated by the famous three mysterious black figures in the back of the scene where Amy and Amy stroke each other's hair (13:31-36).  The one at the right moves in and out like a really bad stencil - an obvious special effect.  I thought that this was to highlight the figures or something, but now I wonder if this was actually done to try and mask movement, and hide the figures?

I remember someone at the time saying that there were crew members behind the sarcophagi to prevent them from damage, but can't find any reference of this anywhere.  The leftmost sarcophagus even moves from being tipped over to being straight up.

I have no idea if all this is a production cock-up or not now.  Hard to believe it if so, as they right-hand stencilly thingy must have taken a lot of effort to do.

With Doctor Who, I can sit and complain for hours. But with Torchwood, I can't find any flaws with it, it just seems so well put together to me. I love how whilst the Doctor has never shown up, he's always talked about. I love how the characters are so human, and how their words and actions can be related to, as opposed to the Doctor, who I find it hard to connect with in any of his incarnations. I like how it deals with humanity's problems, and it's joys. I love how the show is such a darker side of sci-fi that's almost unseen in Doctor Who. I loved Tosh and Owen, and Martha in it. The fact that almost each episode is standalone, and I love how thanks to Torchwood, we got a classic-style four parter (End Of Days/Utopia/Sound Of Drums/Last of The Time Lords - Yes, I know it's not perfect, but it's as close as we've ever gotten, even with these last three episodes and the upcoming one of Doctor Who.

true,Fredquimby,null,null,"What really stands out for me is that when amy first meets river, in time of Angels, there is absolutely nothing about what river says or does which indicates river knows that amy is her mom. That is a bit wacky.   But later upon meeting rory she is certainly humbled.  Maybe this all means something, but more likely it was more important to the story to introduce the concept of river as seen through amy's eyes, i.e. As the doctor's future wife and as someone who killed a good man and is in prison.  So, Generally I think it's best to sit back and relax on these types of observations.

I also noticed that in the impossible astronaut, rivers face is virtually unseen during the whole spacesuit scene, except for the shooting part.  I think we really didn't get much to work with on that point.

Right now I'm accepting that river=spacesuit girl= amy and rory baby = pseudo time lord who can regenerate.  Because that is what we have almost explicitly been told.  But there remains much obfuscation concerning the death of the doctor, and who shot the doctor, and whether the doctor is really supposed to have died.  I think we can count on a story arc resolution that results in a regenerating, full time lord doctor NOT actually dying.  Otherwise it's hard to guess!!!

Honestly, the river character is so great and cool.  Really what good casting!!!!!  I'd rather this character was not becoming so very linked to amy and rory.

Basically examined if when buying digital content, does the purchaser own that particular file or the right to view/hear/etc that material? That is to say, if I've purchased the episode from somewhere, but then lose it, do I have the right to a new free copy? In the physical world, we couldn't just steal a book if say, it burned up in a house fire, because that would hurt the bookseller the second book was stolen from. But what about a file that can be copied at no loss? Do you have the right to re-aquire it by whatever means you'd like? I think yes. But then, when it comes to grabbing the torrent a week before the iTunes/Amazon version comes out (that you've likely prepaid for), is it still reasonable? I'm not sure, but I still think so.

Sorry this was a bit longer than anticipated. Just got me thinking. I really think the concept of pirating will be forcefully left in the dust soon.

If brands are owned by one or two companies then this pressure's not there since it doesn't matter which way consumers vote, they win either way.

For me the argument against it is that you have to be of sound mind to be able to decide to do it and to want to do it 99 time out of 100 you aren't going to be in sound mind.  For cases like the two in the programme, I can see why it worked.  They were clearly still there in mind, but in body they were deteriorating.  

What happens in cases like Pratchett where his body is fine, but his mind is deteriorating?  Clearly he wants to do it, but only at a point where his mind is gone and by definition we don't want to allow him to do it at that point.  It means he's going to have to try and guess a point where he can do it where he is still classed as in sound mind, but only just.  As with all mental disorders, it's possible that he could stay in this state for years - so allowing someone to kill themselves with years of what they would classify as 'good' life seems slightly unethical.

The other concern I have is that doctors should always do what is for the patients best.  If you are a doctor and assisting suicide you may not be perceived as doing the best for the patient.

While it is good to provide aid and vaccines are a very good way of providing that, it does not get to the root of the problem. The tories have cut funding for the economic and political development of developing countries and given to this vaccine programme instead. It has been shown that the more medical aid you give to developing countries the more they will cut their own health budgets, which then only serves to hold back their own medical institutions and cause them further reliance on aid. Also you have to look at the countries who receive aid - India the largest recipient has it own space programme and even hands out international aid itself. Surely it would be better for nations to aid the development and help them get to the root of the problem and help countries build better healthcare systems for themselves and leave the vaccines up to people who want to donate to organisations like MSF.

As for the paradox of creating yourself... it occurs to me that if you want to maximize your chances of destroying a Time Lord, you need to at least try and then be able to learn from the inevitable failure. 

So, make a time loop. Shadowy Figure gets Amy's baby, raise her to destroy the Doctor, and when she fails, send old her back in time to raise herself instead and teach young her what she learned from her mistakes. Repeat until successful. 

This has the added bonus that the Doctor won't be able to learn from his successes, because each destruction attempt is the first, from his temporal point of view.

The missus does design for a magazine. The advertisers can say they want their ad in the news section, the womens section, or if there's a pre-planned feature like 'Hot Fashion for the Summer' then they can ask to go next to it.

What they can't do is predict the future and say ""there's going to be a huge fire in Toxteth on Tuesday, run our Fire Extinguisher ads next to the story which you will inevitably run"".

&gt; What legitimate reason?

Bad placement, bad association. It doesn't matter what the reason is so long as they can legitimately say they're unhappy with the outcome. 

It's not a web ad, so the newspaper can't prove if it had a bad or good effect - it's all down to how much they value Asda as an advertising partner.

true,trellick,english,Holding the Moselle,"Let's not get confused between Patriotism and Nationalism.

Nationalism - Excessive patriotism in one’s country. Nationalists believe that their interests, cultural and social values, or religion is superior to all others on the planet. Nationalists usually have no regard for other countries or cultures that are different from their own and believe they are superior to all others. An example of nationalists are far right conservative Republicans and the British National Party (BNP).

Patriotism - Pride in one’s country and pride in the accomplishments or achievements of one’s country, but not in an extreme way like nationalism (i.e. people who are patriotic love their country but not in a way that they think they are superior to people in other countries and can admire respect other country's qualities)

Given that definition I am patriotic. Very definitely, and that's after a decade+ of living in Europe.

Our greatest assets: sense of humour (and the ability to laugh at ourselves - not many countries can do that), a healthy disrespect for authority, sense of fair play, manners (yes they still do exist!), queuing, Queen, Armed Forces, countryside.

Yes, of course we have our fair share of 'minus' points, but overall the pros outweigh the cons, in my opinion.

Our political system isn't perfect but the long standing traditions make me feel proud. They're stupid and can be hindering during certain processes but I'm for all that pomp. I don't know why, I just love it.

Our magnificent buildings such as the Houses of Parliament and St. Pauls.

As well as the BBC and since I took an extended trip to the USA, the NHS - I never really appreciated what we had before. We really have it good. I'm glad I was born here. I actually missed the food come to think of it too. You cannot get a good roast dinner abroad, and breakfast never consisted of baked beans!

Our rich diversity and overall ability to accept others.

The premise of the action in Libya I'd say is something to kind of be proud of. We're trying to help them get a tiny bit of what we have to try and let the people of Libya build themselves a better future as a country. That is something to be proud of. Military action can always be questionable but the main idea behind it if nothing but good intent is pride worthy.

The fact that we actually have a *proper* history to learn about, which I still plan on doing.

We may not have been the nicest of nations but for a tiny little island we managed to do a hell of a lot, so I think our ability to achieve is something to be proud of, although not necessarily what we decided to achieve back in the day :). We still haven't really fallen either. We may have less clout than we used to but we're still floating up there somewhere. We're still a very tiny drop in a very massive pond. 

Things may seem bad here, but they sure as hell aren't great everywhere else - I'd say America is lagging moreso with their debt, unemployment, politics, education, and they're supposed to be the big guys.

All the great people that come from Britian and have changed the world in some way and become legendary in what they do/did - Darwin, Newton, Shakespeare, Steven Hawking, Charles Dickens etc.

I've never felt so proud to be British when I was away. I was hearing no end of positive things from the random people I met as well as the people who were longing to come and visit us.

Don't listen to the media too much. They're there to scare you with the bad stuff.

Please, please be polite if you ring one of these numbers and just because it's on the internet doesn't make it true. 
Someone once listed a number for the company I used to work for on this site but it wasn't the call centre number, it was a desk phone a couple of desks down from mine at which some customer services type of person had once called a customer back from when they were in this office for a meeting.  We then had to put up with a constant 24/7 stream of calls from people who were all incredibly rude and irate when we pointed out that we were a completely different department who couldn't help them.  We got the site to remove the number but someone then posted it again and claimed we were trying to censor them.  Someone else then worked out that this office had a run of 200 consecutive numbers but all were desk phones utterly unrelated to anything to do with customer services (graphic designers, IT people etc - no-one in the office dealt with customer facing things at all).  For two years the whole office were scared to answer the call because 70% of the time it would be someone screaming down the line at you and as soon as they hung up another phone would start going.  The most irritating thing about it all was that the number the customers should have been calling wasn't a premium line, it was a freephone number so they were paying for a national rate call when if they'd called the proper number it would have been free.
So, yes, it's a useful site but not always accurate so please bear that in mind when you use.

When we were all little primitives we were scared but didn't have much to lose and a whole lot to gain from this God, now that we are all modern and have things and societies and cultures and governments and Old Testament God shows up and says ""Hey follow these rules! and starts roaming around causing governments to fall and destroying alien races.

true,[deleted],null,null,"Because they are preying on the idea that by continuing to call it ""local rate"" will make people think that it is cheap or free to call even though distance-based charging hasn't existed on the telephone network since around 2004 (when BT finally abolished the last plan that did so, and all of its hangers on moved to one that didn't). 

You say that the business paid for some of the cost, that doesn't appear to be the case these days - certainly 0844/5 and 0870 are revenue sharing, so the company gets paid for each minute they rack up. So they can rake it in by putting you on hold. True premium rate numbers (the 09xx) have a lot of restrictions, and you certainly can't put people on hold. So why not these other numbers?

Some of the blame can be laid on the companies that use the numbers (there are legit uses - for example those international calling numbers that let you call the US for 1p/min etc), the others on the telcos (e.g. mobile providers charging 20p/min to call 0800/0808)

It seems that some companies and broadcasters have finally realised that the ""local rate"" doesn't exist, and so they now state how much it would cost to call from a BT line. Makes a lot more sense.

Wasn't one of the 08xx codes kneecapped by Ofcom to reduce/eliminate the cost of calling them? That's why they've all moved to another one that isn't.

And to be honest, there's something wrong if you won't pay the BBC a not at all unreasonable fee to watch their content (the BBC is a non-profit organisation). Not only will it get you the content you want, it helps subsidise the licence fee for those of us in the UK (and who are paying for the content you are trying to get around paying for yourself).

I would fully advocate the use of a VPS or VPN if you have already paid the licence fee and just want to use it abroad while out of the country, however. It makes you wonder why the BBC doesn't offer that sort of service - e.g. your TV licence number linked to a BBC account grants you a years' access to the UK iPlayer.",0,1308066426,null,0,true,0,c1zmykp,t3_hzb0k,t1_c1zmykp,t1_c1zm68d,1427244453,6,false,BritishTV,t5_2rzot,6

Note first of all my company only uses local rate numbers. Our customer service line is a local number. Sales do have an 0800 number, but our local rate number is also posted on the website for those calling from mobiles.

The 0870 website is full of either numbers which outright don't work, or as stated by the above poster, are for specific desk phones.

A specific desk phone is 100% certain to get you through to someone that can't help you. Even if they can help you, they still need to put you back into the main CS queue, for call recording purposes. There is no benefit in using the 0870 website to skip queues, it simply doesn't work. If a local rate line is already provided, as in my companies case, always use it.

Someone in my office spitefully posted all the team leader desk phone numbers onto the 0870 website when they left the company. They all got plagued by calls they couldn't answer, because as a team leader, their job is to monitor staff performance, they do not have access to all the systems required to do the job.

The problem with the particular website the OP linked, is that it is poorly moderated, and very outdated throughout.

Not that hard. You have three options as far as I know.

1) Become a member of LFC, it costs 30 quid and allows you to buy tickets in advance from the LFC site. If you want to take your wife then I believe you will need to buy one for her too. But bare in mind that the bigger the game the harder it will be to get tickets this way. For example, Liverpool v Stoke would be very easy, Liverpool v Man U would be virtually impossible.

2) Book a package with Thomas Cook sport. You can buy tickets to any game from them, (they are the official travel partner). This is an easy option as your tickets are guaranteed to any game. It will however cost much more than the face value of the ticket and probably includes a meal before or use of some exclusive bar or other.

3) Get tickets nearer the time from one of the ticket exchanges on the liverpool forums. Probably not suitable as they are far from guaranteed, although it is by far the cheapest option.

As for places to stay it depends what you are prepared to pay for. The Malmaison and Hope Street hotel are fantastic but really expensive. A good average price hotel in a good location would be the Premier Inn or the Holiday Inn both on the Albert Dock.

Also if you are coming in April be aware that the Grand National is in early April, all the hotels will be booked months in advance and the prices go right up too.

Confusion is OFCOM's watchword.

Take for example 070xx numbers. You might think that they are mobile numbers, because that's what people think 07xxx numbers are.

They aren't - they are ""personal numbering services"" numbers, which can charge a maximum of 49p/min (from memory), with a lot of that going to the number owner.

The use of these numbers extends (extended?) as far as the patent-side telephones in many NHS hospitals. So when your loved ones are sick, you get to pay 49p/min to speak to them (or they can call you for 20p/min).

It depends on the phone system used by the company and how it handles withheld calls vs. genuine international calls (there is a difference; that's why your landline phone may say ""international"" on some calls).

One way of getting around it is to use one of the cheap call providers, since they often route calls across the world because it's cheaper (somehow) - then it will show up as being international and all is well.

Secondly, I  both disagree and agree that it is good that they don't have to worry about being re-elected - if someone wants to be voted for, surely they would work harder for their reputation to remain intact? On the otherhand, the peers are still recommended by the Prime Minister, and they will always choose more of their own party than the opposition. Surely it would be better to mix them all up and not allow factions to form? Sort of anonimous voting? 

Anyway, there has been Tory hegemony in the Lords since its creation, only recently has the balance tipped towards Labour slightly. In fact it was the King's order that the 1911 Parliament Act be passed, or else he would elect more Liberal Lords to the house (the Lords at this time were generally being conservative bastards on the issue of Irish independence [Home Rule], even though the Bill had passed several times through the commons, FYI).

I would also say, as much as I am an idealist for democracy, where everyone is equal, and I would love a society where politicians are elected wholly responsible and answerable to the public rather than their own agendas, I forsee the near future still with the Constitutional Monarchy and the House of Lords as taming forces. Us Brits are in fact quite a moderate bunch, there is and never has been a popular radical party, left or right.

true,[deleted],null,null,"More importantly, ""Rory seems to be dead, Amy is crying, let's all feel sad now"" is Moffat's favourite way to inject some subtle emotion into the show. That's not good news when we know someone's getting killed.

Given that Doctor Who writers only ever kill people who were introduced in the episode that where they're killed, I sincerely hope that River does kill either Rory or the Doctor and that her victim stays dead.

That, of course, would mean the Doctor is perfectly safe - and Rory is screwed. Plus, the Doctor is going to have to get over it because most of his relationship with River is in his future.

So, if Rory dies, the Doctor is going to have a long and significant relationship with the woman who murdered one of his companions - and the husband of his other companion, and the father of his companions baby, not to mention the father of the murderer.

This would be an ""interesting"" direction for the show to take.

On the other hand, given that Moffat can't kill off a main character to save his own life, that means the ""greatest man"" is probably going to be the guy who taught her to pilot the TARDIS, and she's already said the Doctor was busy that day.

(Yes, I know, ""everybody lies"". But in that case she might have lied, and was actually in prison for failing to pay a parking ticket.)

She's going to kill a character we haven't seen before, yet alone had time to get attached to.

There's a slim possibility that [whats-his-name from ""The Lodger""](/spoiler) last season is supposed to be back and could turn out to be a time lord in hiding, like the Master, and everyone who didn't hate that episode will be at least mildly sad about that death.

So she might kill a character we've seen before but didn't get very attached to.

So, the options are:

1. She kills the Doctor, he gets better
2. She kills Rory, he gets better
3. She kills Rory, the Doctor loves her even more and Amy doesn't have any issues worth mentioning
4. She kills some minor character, he stays dead

There's a chance that Rory voluntarily sacrifices his life to save his wife and baby, and when River says she ""kills"" someone, she means she feels terrible about being unable to prevent it, rather than ""murder"".

Seriously though, if she kills Rory (whether or not he gets better) but somehow she still deserves to be in prison then that would make the Pond-Williams family reunion *really* awkward, and while that would make great TV I don't think they're really going to have time to do that storyline properly.

I'm sticking with the ""there's another character out there, probably a time lord"" theory as my preferred option, with ""she doesn't actually kill anyone who stays dead and therefore probably isn't the universes most dangerous supervillain and 'stormcage' is actually a minimum security facility for low-risk offenders, maybe she got done for negligent use of a firearm that could have caused injury and not murder"" as the more likely option.

Who says she wanders in and out of the most secure prison out there? Maybe she's not worth the effort of keeping in a high security prison.",0,1308089486,null,0,true,0,c1zpguz,t3_hzjll,t1_c1zpguz,t1_c1zp7jy,1427245643,9,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,9

true,[deleted],null,null,"I agree with your definitions of nationalism and patriotism- but many people still have problems with patriotism when defined as such. For example, even if you completely think that all other countries which deserve to be equal *are* equal, you are hardly likely to be gushing about the achievements of those countries. It is the idea that you are highlighting the achievements of someone else simply because you happened to live in the same country, and the idea that you are actually proud is somewhat odd- why be proud of something which you have no effect over?

I am somewhere in the middle when it comes to this debate. Obviously I enjoy revelling in the highlights of our country, as I live here and it is nice to think about the good things; however, when we talk about being proud, I can't agree. There is no reason to be proud. The country we live in is very good, and we are lucky to live in it, but we should decide this for ourselves and not through a sense of obligation. Patriotism is not simply the admiration of your country's better features- I would call that common sense.
