has the following hash:

and then paste it into your browser's address bar.

If you create a bookmarklet with the following code (for Firefox):

    javascript:var magnetLink='magnet:?xt=urn:btih:'+document.getSelection();location.assign(magnetLink);

you can just highlight the hash and click the bookmarklet to download.

There is a particular degree of tongue-in-cheek misogynism during these years, but it is more a symbol of the change of the times. If you want some true classic anti-feminism, you'd really just have to look at some of the very beginnings of the first Doctor, but even then it is more often an aspect of ageism directed toward Susan. 

The most direct form of what could really be considered anti-feminism was in a part of the first serial, An Unearthly Child, when Ian was injured to the point that he couldn't walk and the Doctor insisted that he carry Ian in spite of the fact that Barbara and Susan were both more physically capable of the task than the elderly Hartnell. 

Watching the respect given toward women in the early episodes of the show increase didn't look to me like evidence of anti-feminism, but instead was a way of chronicling the advances that the feminist movement made.

Malouda plays well, but I still think it's a case of the team playing well and him being in a good position to finish more than it it's him being as good as his stats. He's too streaky; we need someone who can spark us when our traditional leaders aren't getting the job done. Don't think that's him.

In this respect film and literature are better indicators of changing attitudes.

Ahha! U-Kayus Chavus!

This race is known to take advantage of child protection laws to operate above police control - and can be known to a great many officers in the area.

They tend to hate the police (pigs/filth/coppers) - who ""get up in my shit"" way too much - meaning they prevent them from:

* Arson
* Petty theft
* Grand theft auto / TWOK (taken without owners consent)
* Battery
* GBH
* Assault
* Juvenile delinquency
* ASBO violations
* Drunken / Disorderly conduct
* Public nuisance
* Public indecency
* Impulsive / destructive behaviour.

Normally families of this race are fully integrated into the social-services, and child-welfare systems.

One of their main legal past-times is hanging out with many friends on streets. This tends to be from any age... toddlers to old people.

The situation you see here is a Chav-Woman mouthing off to the Filth in a shocking manner to gain cheap ""peer-points"" from her friends, and gel her relationship with her peers by attacking a ""common enemy"" openly.

Given all this - it's not surprising in the least how she acted.

I got into Doctor Who with Eccleston, and I admit once Tennant came along I forgot about the 9th Doctor pretty quickly. But in retrospect I deeply miss him.

Also, I've kinda felt Matt Smith's Doctor is much closer in personality to the 9th than the 10th... but not quite as dark. If it helps, maybe finish Tennant's episodes first and then go back, because you might notice some events take place that not only obviously explain 11, but can be used to potentially explain who 9 is.

The first few episodes of that season are also the worst, in my opinion, and they only get better.

Yes.

&gt;Is there a harddrive that can act as a pvr as well?

To get PVR funtionality, you just need to add a [TV tuner(s)](http://www.ebuyer.com/search?page=1&amp;limit=10&amp;store=2&amp;cat=216&amp;subcat=2905).

&gt;I've just bought my 1st house and I need to get my entertainment system set up sweet.

A PC connected to a HDTV is by far the greatest entertainment system possible. All you need is an intertent connection and if you want, you can download any music, movie, or TV show and store them on the hard drive to listen to or watch whenever you want.

If you put in a a half decent graphics card, then it's also the best gaming system around, capable of far better graphics than the PS3 and Xbox 360. You can use a keyboard &amp; mouse, PC controller, PS3 controller or XBOX 360 controller. You can also emulate pretty much every console and computer up to and including the Nintendo Wii. PC gaming has been around for a very long time and its catalogue of games is far larger than any console. Add to it all the games from the consoles it can emulate as well. Also, the cartridge based games are tiny, so you can fit the complete catalogue of games on your hard drive. You can also emulate arcade systems as well.

It's also a PC, so you've got full internet access and millions of programs to use.

If you're interested in building such a system then I'd wait a month. AMD are releasing a new chip called Llano, with good enough graphics built in.

If you have no interest in gaming though, I'd go with something like the [Antec ISK-100 Mini-ITX Desktop Case](http://www.dabs.com/products/antec-isk-100-mini-itx-desktop-case-76C5.html?utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=product+search&amp;utm_content=Q200) and use an AMD E350 mothberboard/CPU. Then again, it would probably handle TF2 which is now free.

&gt;But what about things like match of the day?

[Not a problem.](http://thepiratebay.org/search/Match%20of%20the%20Day/0/99/0). Why settle for highlights though when you can get the [full game](http://thepiratebay.org/search/EPL/0/99/0).

&gt;You can't get everything you want with torrents...

You pretty much can though, and if it's from America, you'll be getting it before it's even available in Britain.

&gt;...so I think streaming is a decent option for some TV

To me, I could only see it being useful under mobile circumstances.

&gt;Also, why can't you download any tv series you want legally? That service would rock, that's what I really want.

I think it has to do with the gravitas Eccleston brought to the role. Every emotion that Nine felt, he felt deeply. Every life was precious to him. (I love Eleven, but he seems so cavalier about life sometimes, eg [brainwashing all of humanity to kill the Silence on sight](/spoiler).) Nine is a war veteran. He's fresh off a war that ended with the destruction of his people and planet, and he acts that way. So when Nine does have those moments of frivolity, it is even more meaningful. 

There's no real way that the Doctor is supposed to act. Some of the Doctors from the older series were darker, more thoughtful, less jubilant and quirky. I mean, it's a matter of preference, and everyone's got ""their"" Doctors. But each Doctor is going to have a slightly new take, or else it gets a bit boring. Who knows what Twelve will be like? It's exciting that way..

But the first series of new Who definitely have some great episodes you shouldn't miss out on. Dalek, The Empty Child/The Doctor Dances, and Bad Wolf/The Parting of the Ways are my favorites from that series, so I'd recommend starting with those. Especially The Empty Child/The Doctor Dances, which are probably widely regarded as the best episodes from Nine's run. If you watch no other episodes from Nine, then just watch those two.

If you're comparing it to anywhere outside of Liverpool then it's irrelevant since we're in the Liverpool subreddit.

You local rates will not be amongst the best local rates in Europe, because they are lower than some national rates.  While it's admirable for small populations to try harder, I maintain that as a nation, the UK compares poorly. There is no financial, technical or logistical reason for any great discrepancy with other countries, therefore I conclude the problem is cultural.

  I was kinda underwhelmed. The plot narrative was hard to follow halfway through and the last episode really piled it all on and was information overload. 

  That said, the characters were sharp, crisply written and well defined. The pacing was a bit jerky at times fast others long pauses and just stationary camera back/forth over a conversation. 

  The last episode pissed me off pretty hard tho. Gabriel's partner Lia had a really insignificant role and wasn't trusted with any information throughout the series, basically. But then she was called upon as a sniper (which i guess they setup only in this episodes intro?) to take out some guy, i dont really eve know how she knows about gatehouse or why he would have needed to die. I can understand her as backup but as an active sniper ready to take out an target?

  Gatehouse was a superbad ass. But i'm expected to believe a 55+ year old man who was shot 3 times can recover that fast? After being blow up the previous week? 

  Furthermore as all of the players know of gatehouses involvement (all together at end, which was not how the arrangement was with Glickman only knowing about gatehouse) can't they just pool money and cut him out? I mean he's only one (super)man, as much as the police could i guess get involved if he was to be taken out no one knows much about the operation anymore.

I don't blame the actor entirely; he was carrying a kids show on his back and was clearly being directed to ham it to the max, probably with the direction of, ""like you did in *Casanova* but more OTT"".  I find his angsty histrionic melodramania painful to watch now that the show is on a mostly more mature, subtle tread when it comes to the acting and (especially) writing.

I liked Tennant in Einstein and Eddington, and thought he was fantastic in Casanova, so I have nothing against him as an actor.

People who take jobs working in the public sector tend to earn less than they would have if they'd worked in the private sector.  If you want good hospitals, good schools, etc then you need to pay your workers a competitive wage with benefits otherwise you won't get good nurses, good doctors, good teachers etc.  We've seen shortages of applicants to jobs in the public sector recently.

The real trouble is that to get things to stop going up in price so quickly the BoE would have to increase interest rates.  If it does that then foreclosures on houses would increase, more people would be thrown back into the social housing pool and we'd be knocked back into recession as disposable income went back down.

Really we've been screwed over by the same thing that the US was: the sub-prime housing market.  We've trained people to think that the housing market was a sound investment for an increase in wealth rather than a sound investment for an increase in quality of living (ie somewhere to live).  Because of this people have houses they can't afford thinking that they'll go up in price and it will make them richer without doing anything.

true,Kim147,uk,British Sandgroper,"Copyright is not a black and white situation . If one bought an album in record format and then when the technology advanced one bought the same album on CD one is paying twice for the same copyright license . This is no different that converting a CD to MP3 format - different format , however , this time , same copyright license payment .

You also have the ""legitimate use"" concept - very important . It is why say 10% of books could be photocopied - legitimate use for academic research .

However My concerns go a lot further than just copyright . I am primarily concerned that this legislation will be a cop out - it will be the same as the paedophile influenced censorship movements which , instead of dealing with the offenders , it allows the offenders to continue offending whilst at the same time penalising all consumers . Censorship , which is what this is , has a long history of misuse - being used by governments for political purposes . It also has a long history of being misapplied - the wrong things being censored and things that 'should' be censored not being censored . During the 60's and 70's there were quite a few incidents where songs where wrongly banned and others that were not banned that theoretically should have been . The classic being Drinkin Rum &amp; Coca Cola by the Andrew Sisters - WWII time . These days we live in a more enlightened age so we don't have those censorship problems .

You've also got the situation where the main public Internet has a lot of ways around it . There are so many ways of getting past the controls that it is almost impossible to police . There are many different ways of coding data and accessing data . There is also the Deep Web which is much larger than the Google indexed surface web . And driving it all underground just makes it harder to find and police .

A lot of these legislations are often very one sided . They not only protect the large corporate concerns they allow the large corporate concerns to game the system against the small concerns and against the private person . And they do not protect the small concerns and the private person . 

You need to have clear legislation and you need to go after the prime offenders . If you want to prevent illegal copyright violations then use technical means - if it's done right then it is a very possible thing to do . What I am talking about here is coding the download files such that they can only be accessed within a licensed environment - ie. you download the file and the license onto your 'mp3' player and you can then play the track.

You have the further problem of lack of availability of material . It is often very difficult for people to get DVD's and CD's that they want - HMV and the like don't sell a large range , even on their web sites . Also many Internet sites only allow region based access . This is why quite a lot of people resort to torrenting movies .

Now this is another issue - programs such as bittorrent and associated link sites have a huge legitimate use . Accessing movies maybe a misuse but is actually only a part of the usage that is alongside  many other legitimate uses . It's important that these technologies and websites are not penalised for any illegitimate use by their customers .

And - another issue - link sites - agglomeration sites - are not publishers - they do not hold the files - they only hold links to the files . The files are held on hosted web servers within specific domain areas . The hosted web servers are not publishers . Only the domain area is a publisher . When you get into technology , especially new technology , all sorts of new understandings and new distinctions have to be made .

Web neutrality is a vital principle that must be adhered to . If the corporations start gaming the Internet - eg. by filtering and by bandwidth shaping - they will destroy the openness and the flat playing field of the Internet . IE. basically they will destroy the Internet . The Internet is the success that it is purely because it was , right from the start , completely open , low cost and a flat playing field . There were other 'Internets' before the Internet but they weren't as successful and widespread and they didn't survive . Compuserve is probably the classic example .

Simple question - ""How does a major studio control a minor independent studio ?"" - quite simple - filter them out . How does Hollywood control Pinewood ? - quite simple - filter them out .

And what - ie. whose - standards do you use to filter out ?

 If you want to remove paedophilia then you need to track down the actual paedophiles themselves and prosecute them , stop them doing what they are doing and rescue the children . If it means getting tough with Russia get tough with Russia . Just don't sweep it under the carpet .

Likewise copyright infringement - use sensible policing . Also , don't forget , there has been a lot of infringement by the major players that hasn't been prosecuted by the governments - case going on in Canada.

You also have a whole host of situations where people's private copyright is frequently violated . Posting photos onto private websites or private areas - such as Facebook - and those photos being 'stolen' by news organisations , for example - happens quite commonly . And then there is the issue of chain emails - emails doing the rounds - eg. containing jokes , photos etc. - what happens with the copyright in these ? It is not uncommon for people to nick parts of photos to use as their 'avatar' on blog sites - what happens with the copyright in these situations ? What happens when people copy photos from web sites into emails to send to friends ?

You - the government - need to do the policing yourself - not fob it off onto other companies and organisations . And you must be fully transparent with it - basic justice principle .

You've also got the whole evidence issue . The way that the Internet works is that households are normally assigned a dynamic IP address with a short lease - eg. 11 hours . After the lease expires a new address is assigned . This is all due to the restricted number of IP addresses available . Further within each household there are local IP addresses assigned to each unit connected in to the household's network . Each of these units share the external IP address . They can be , and often are , multiple computers - PC's , laptops etc. - each with different users . And if the household network is open , or even partially open - there is a technical facility for this , then anyone else can also be sharing in the household's IP address . So all of a sudden you have a great difficulty , in practice , in proving who is the offender - so you penalise the whole household ? - not exactly natural justice !

You have also got the whole issue of 'innocent access' . People can quite easily find sites , that you would perhaps like to ban , and watch movies that they might think are perfectly ok. to watch - eg. no copyright problems - but they might be violating the law without realising it . It is actually quite easy , even with Google searches , to find sites that should perhaps be avoided .

And there is the issue of where illegitimate access can end up promoting sales . YouTube is a classic example in this. People often , myself included , use You Tube to listen to tracks before buying an album . It is also useful to find out who the singer or band is and what the album is . Going through places such as http://www.reddit.com/r/Jazz/ one can get all sorts of leads to all sorts of interesting music , listen to it on YouTube and then maybe buy the album . And then what about sites such as Imgur , Flikr and mp3tube ?

And there is the issue of 'non copyright' material passing into the domain of 'copyright' material . A good example of this is the Linux operating system . Linux has been developed under the GNU GPL license which is basically :- software developed freely - many of the developers don't charge for their work , software source code made freely - ie. publically - available , software machine code available free of charge and freely available . Cannonical is very good in respecting these principles and they have spent a lot of their own money developing the Ubuntu variant . However with some of the corporations making a lot of money out of Linux - for example Google with Android - one has to ask the questions :- are they using code that has been developed free of charge ? , are they paying for that code ? , do they make all of their Linux OS level source code and machine code freely available and free of charge ? This same principle can be applied in other areas where commercial operations have used freely developed and obtained creative output . This may be in movies - eg. Life in a Day - or it may be on web sites - eg. Huffington Post .

I have to admit I'm assuming normal distribution for local recycling rates, which may be wrong.  With that assumption, a 50% local recycling rate would be at the right of the bell curve for the UK, [given these figures](http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/datablog/2009/jan/15/household-recycling-rubbish-data) but approximate to the national figure for Sweden.  For Sweden to have that figure, it would have approximately 50% of it's local areas with a higher rate and 50% with a lower rate, (depending on the actual distribution).  The crapper part of Sweden's bell curve overlaps the better bit of ours, in other words. It would be more accurate to say your local rates may be comparable to the better national averages, because there must be local areas elsewhere in Europe with significantly higher rates to generate those averages (unless these countries actually have really skewed rates, where almost everywhere is the same).

However, I'd like to say I completely agree the situation has improved hugely in recent times, despite the pedantry in the paragraph above.

Problem is, what choice do these people have ? 

Many of these people decided to serve their country 5, 10, 15 or even 20 years ago. They did that knowing that they would not receive a comparable pay rate to the private sector and in a LOT of cases they decided that they could live with that knowing that in 30 or 35 years they could retire somewhere nice.

Now, suddenly that's changing underneath them. Those people who have faced the worst our country has to offer are finding that they did it for nothing and won't even be able to buy that retirement that made dealing with it all tolerable.

My girlfriend is a teacher, and thus I know many teachers. When you start out in almost any profession you don't make much, but after a year or two teachers (here at least) make at least low 30s a year. Which is well above the median wage, and with extremely generous holiday entitlements too.

The whole notion teachers are somehow hard done by is poppycock. In fact, the teacher's strike was not voted in by a majority of teachers. It barely scraped a majority amongst those who bothered to vote, while almost a plurality of teachers didn't even bother to vote on the measure. A fact that is telling, because there exists a very vocal minority of teachers who are violently opposed to any kind of scaling back of their pensions, and for most teachers (who are usually fairly reasonable and recognise their good benefits)) it isn't worth sticking out in any way.

I'd be fine with the teachers striking if it was their own contributions that were coming under attack, as you make out. But that's not what is happening, in fact, is it? teachers pensions in England are currently mostly *unfunded* and paid directly via taxation. teachers *don't* pay their own pension - taxpayers do. The entire point of the reforms is to change to a situation where teachers do pay their own pensions.

And as I said in another comment, the state does in fact have a right to unilaterally modify employment contracts. It has done so many times in the past, to improve fairness, and when it is in the union's interest that's been unremarkable.

Your question about 'what can I do there legally' got me thinking that it might be worth pointing out the legal age of majority in the UK is 18 (iirc it is 21 in the USA?), so you may not be a minor while you're over in the UK, if you're between 18 and 21. As for what there is to do, I'm no expert, but punting is a classic tourist activity (which many of us students also enjoy from time to time), if you're in a summer study program, I imagine you'll meet some people there to hang out with.

One of the mistakes you should definitely not make while here is calling Cambridge University a school :P Unless you actually meant one of the many schools in and around Cambridge, in which case my apologies. Assuming you do mean Cambridge University (and even then, assuming ""The University of Cambridge"", as opposed to Anglia Ruskin, the other university in Cambridge), what it's like varies greatly from college to college really (are you staying at a particular college) and department to department. If you want to let us know where you're going to be studying someone might be able to tell you more. In my experience (Computer Science, Emmanuel College) it's not very strict at all.

A pelican crossing is something I thought you had in the US as well (at least when I've been there). It's just a designated crossing spot on a road. You press a button when you arrive at the crossing to indicate there are pedestrians waiting to cross. There will then be a green light to tell you when to cross, just like traffic lights for cars.

I can see why the recycling wagon wouldn't take the black plastic bags - but note that we have a separate collection for the wheely bins, this is not the regular trash wagon. The guy at the council office told me literally all they can deal with are the wheely bins contents.

I see what you mean by the extra bags - if everyone did it then I can see it getting full of garden trash - are the green bags simply saying 'pay for the bags' so you fewer people put garden waste in with their regular waste?

The black and green bags go into the same trash wagon. But there are so many things wrong with this system IMHO:

1: If the wagon gets 3/4 through its round and is suddenly confronted with 10-15 green bags, do they leave them if the wagon is full? The resident paid for the green bags to be picked up.

2: There is no imposed limit on the amount of bags that can be put out - usually if I put out (at most) 3 bags of house rubbish I get three bags back for next time - unless #3

3: The bags are all collected into a central place under a streetlight by the binmen who are waiting for the wagon to move to their location - so at this point they don't know whos rubbish is whos?

true,[deleted],null,null,"I support the strikes, and I think it is absurd not to, given that many of the employees work in these areas precisely because of the better pensions (teaching especially), and taking this away after the fact is certainly unfair.

But I don't think it hits the real issues, and as such, will likely not be well received, for as others mention, private sector workers already suffer worse conditions, and in these economic conditions, the pressures will likely only worsen, and so people are unlikely to support others they perceive as unfairly getting a better deal. This is why individual strikes will not work.

The fundamental problem behind the current crisis is the economic system itself, which creates this situation where an abundance of labour and improving technology is used to drive down wages and working conditions, rather than to relieve the burden of work and provide security for all. The debt crisis is somewhat a result of globalisation hitting tax revenues as it drives down wages and corporation tax, and with the economic crisis (inherent in the current economic system due to the gap between the productive capacity of labourers and the purchasing power of their wages) conditions will only worsen until all workers are working for a subsistence wage, so they spend all their time working just so they can afford the rent, fuel/transport costs, food, clothing, water and energy bills just to continue working.

The only solution is for all the workers, the great dispossessed majority who are denied their inheritance in the Earth's common resources, to unite together in One Big Union. And then with a great strike they can put an end to this great charity they currently provide the capitalists - by giving up the majority of the value of their labour directly and then paying the same class for access to resources they did nothing to produce. Only with a true general strike can this tyranny be broken.

Peterhouse is one of the oldest colleges, so it's probably likely to have a higher degree of strange traditions than many.

Hopefully there will be someone around from Peterhouse to tell you more. The Peterhouse website is [here](http://www.pet.cam.ac.uk/), but I imagine you've already found it.

true,[deleted],null,null,"Perhaps, but even strong unionism does not solve all the issues, for we still face the problems of economic crises, unemployment, and the threat of globalisation and automation destroying such unionism.

As William Morris wrote in _News From Nowhere_:

&gt;""So far as the masses of the oppressed class furthered this scheme of improvement, they did it to get themselves improved slave-rations—as many of them as could.  And if those classes had really been incapable of being touched by that instinct which produced the passion for freedom and equality aforesaid, what would have happened, I think, would have been this: that a certain part of the working classes would have been so far improved in condition that they would have approached the condition of the middling rich men; but below them would have been a great class of most miserable slaves, whose slavery would have been far more hopeless than the older class-slavery had been.”

Is this not what we see with globalisation? Social democracy may help alleviate the troubles of some workers but it is at the cost of workers' elsewhere, for the wealthy will not give up their wealth easily. And with globalisation it is almost entirely ineffective, as the governments are held to ransom by the corporations who can threaten to move elsewhere and the unions rarely even have national influence nevermind international influence.

I think the only real solution is to put an end to this system where a privileged minority may live off the work of the dispossessed majority. We must adopt true socialism, so that we may employ all people and automate as much work as possible with positive benefits for all. It seems truly absurd that the majority of people spend their lives working, just to earn enough money to pay rent, transport costs, fuel bills, etc. to carry on working - indeed, life is the one resource squandered by this corrupt system more than any other.

And also, how old were you when you left American? The golden time for the majority of kids to become little bastards to each other is in high school (so 11+). That's not saying there aren't any from an earlier age but they're generally more spread out - as in one or two a class. So if you left before 11 then it would be reasonable that you'd think all the kids in America much nicer than those here purely because you got them at a good time.

The Maghull version of 'gangsters at 11' are pretty much soft-arses who want to look cool to their mates, but would run at the first sign of trouble. Got to say I prefer that than some of the rougher areas where the skalls actually back up their posturing with their behaviour. It also tends to level out around the age of 16-18 and they become more 'indie' (as we called it) and if the arrogance is still there the 'gangsta' part of it is less if not gone - obviously this isn't the same for everyone but you'll mostly find all the little chavs in the outer regions of Liverpool/Sefton are all under 16-18. Which is another reason why I think you're probably quite young, since you might not have experienced this first-hand (as in, watching people leave the chaviness behind).

In regards to what you said further up about Maghull being 'dull and boring', I'll agree there's usually not much going on, especially for young people. However, as a place to live I personally think the area and the inhabitants are not 'pretty shitty', aside from the occasional little bugger.

Running at the first of trouble is correct if the ""Plastic Gangsters"" that all go to schools in Maghull and most live here, will run if they are alone which instead they always hang around in big groups of anywhere around 10 - 30 some times, in parks with 2 litre bottles of Strongbow and a 10 deck of L &amp; B having sly ""Ciggy's"" whilst wearing all the awful clothes and face/head accessories that I mentioned earlier, they still wear the same even on a really hot summer's day.

Plus, what you're basically saying is that you hate the *youth* in Maghull. Because I don't know if you realise but the majority of people living there (and especially Lydiate) are much older people. In terms of the chavs and skals in Maghull, they are a much bigger presence and much more intimidating everywhere else in Liverpool. 

And I don't understand why you would say that it's 'boring and dull' then talk about how dangerous you find it to be. If we're talking random anecdotal evidence about people being jumped then I could go on about all the people I've known who've been jumped/mugged in the city centre, so that argument is pretty much pointless since it's an unfortunate part of many cities.

true,Ivashkin,null,null,"&gt; I'd suggest reasonableness is a perfectly good test. Even the US states that have a castle doctrine have reasonableness tests built into them. I have friends who live in the country, and I have to trudge over fields and large gardens to get to their front door. Should I expect a shotgun blast if they don't recognise me? Maybe I've got the wrong address and I'm walking across the wrong garden? Or if I enter a house to call hello because they left their front door open? What if someone does break into your house but it's the 5 year old kid from next door wanting to play with your dog?

And the various versions of castle doctrine in place in the US, there is a lot of emphasis on the occupant having to comply with various measures before it would be considered an act of self defense. The [wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Castle_doctrine#Conditions_of_use) article gives an overview on them.  And people have been indited for not meeting those requirements.

&gt; Like I said previously, I've yet to see a case where a homeowner has been unjustly convicted for attacking an intruder in self defence. You could argue that the guy who chased the intruders who''d held his family hostage was acting reasonably, and I'd agree, but that wasn't self defence, and won't change under the proposals. In fact. I'd argue the system leans the other way, and I've seen a fair few cases where the police have either coached the homeowner in what to say in their statement or turned a blind eye to what occurred.

I can't find any either, but it's hard to google from a tablet. What I can find is a lot of cases where people have to go through a justice system which doesn't like the fact that people have taken the law into their own hands. It's all very well if the police turn a blind eye or coach people but we need actual laws in place which apply to everyone, not just those who won the sensible cop 999 call out lottery. 

&gt; BTW, in the /ukpolitics/ version of this thread you said there's a duty to retreat. The rules for that were done away with with the Criminal Law Act in 1967, replaced with reasonableness. The CPS guidelines specifically say that failure to retreat does not conclusively preclude the use of self defence as a defence. It's merely a factor to be taken into account, and in one's own house, unlikely to be a significant factor.

I didn't say there was a a duty to retreat, I was saying that if we look at castle doctrine laws in the US, some states have duty-to-retreat and some have stand-your-ground, my hope is that if we take any inspiration from the US laws its the stand-your-ground part we look at, and not duty-to-retreat.",0,1309381237,null,0,false,0,c22oci0,t3_ic6xg,t1_c22oci0,t1_c22oaer,1427298319,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

Love &amp; Monsters introduced the ""Doctor-less"" episode, a relatively low budget episode that could be shot at the same time as another one, ensuring the series came in on time and on budget.  Love &amp; Monsters was however, rubbish.

Blink upped the ante on these types of episodes, bringing us some of the best examples of Moff's DW story telling with it's ontological paradoxes &amp; Innocent Object Nightmare Fuel.

Midnight (and Turn Left) upped the game again, and since series 5 &amp; 6 haven't had any Doctor-less episodes have yet to be topped.  By splitting the 2 productions between The Doctor &amp; Donna we instantly had leads we were familiar with.

But enough about the production trick, what makes Midnight brilliant is simply it's writing. Neil Gaiman stated ""There are things that happen for budget reasons that actually make things better"" and this show proves it. Limited to two sets and limited VFX for a creature and suddenly RTD created a fantastic psychological drama that is purely character driven.

The characterisations may be very broad, but are written perfectly so that we know these people instantly. The family outing with the sulky teenager, the loss and lonliness of the recently broken hearted, the arrogance of the teacher vs the student and the nameless hostess working a life of servitude.

But this is Doctor Who and we need a monster, cheap! And what a monster! It's gets in your head and steals your voice, I mean how awesome is that? Our voices, language and colloqualisms make us all unique as human beings. To have something steal this from us rendering us mute? It's the ultimate in identity theft! Massive props to both Tennant and Lesley Sharp for their voice scenes, perfectly delivered and if I remember correctly all captured on set with no ADR.

Again, RTD delivers some excellent writing and observations on human nature and stupidity as the hive mind takes effect at the end of the voice stealing. Of course, while humans can be vicious, cruel and stupid they can also be intelligent, brave and self sacrificing. And who is it who sacrifices themselves? Our downtrodden Hostess.

This episode is very similar in fact to Red Dwarf's Marooned. A single set with all of the drama/comedy coming from the characters and their psychosis'. And both could be performed on a theatre stage easily.

The fact of the matter is that transfers and youth development are an enormous part of the game and can dictate a huge amount of a team's success.  Just  look at the top squads in England: you either have owners that continuously throw money at their problems (Chelsea or Man City) and can afford to have multiple big transfers fall through, or teams that have made intelligent transfer decisions, bought young players, and built successful youth development programs (Man United and Arsenal). That's not to say that United and Arsenal haven't splashed out cash for a few big signings, but that's more to keep fans happy than anything else and is a requirement of being a ""big club."" I'm sure Kenny and Co. would find a degree of success without Comolli, but the fact of the matter is that coaching can only do so much for a player.  Plus, without Champions, or even Europa League football it becomes that much harder to attract big names.  They have to do more digging to find guys that fit the mold of a Liverpool player, something that Comolli seems to excel at.

Her demeanor there is perfectly indicative of someone who has just had a really wonderful time being brought crashing down to Earth by somewhat of a horrible memory. We also need to remember that this is River at the height of her relationship with The Doctor, and would know that Demons Run is a horrible memory for him, despite the revelation at the end and if we assume that River is genuine about her emotions for him, would be saddened by the whole battle just as much.

The reason I think that it's the River from the end of DotM is twofold: Firstly, the clothing clues. River is shown in different clothing every time we see her. Except this time. Secondly, the end of DotM is the last time The Doctor saw her, and thus the first place he'd go to talk to her. The Rivers in his own personal future are unpredictable, therefore he has to go to his past. And to keep it as simple as possible, he'd go to the most recent version where he isn't nearby.

It does appear that she knows the outcome of the battle before we see her, but this does fit in with her being there the whole time and only showing herself at the end.

Consider the monsters.  Blink's monsters are entirely unique creatures in the horror genre.  Quantum locking them and giving them a simple set of rules made them a monster unparalleled until the Silence came about.  The monster in Midnight, on the other hand, can trace its origins to earlier writers, especially Lovecraft.  The vague evil that lay hidden for thousands of years and resurfaced to possess someone is unoriginal at best and a trope at worst.

Everyone sites the character portraits in Midnight as beautiful, but ""humanity panics in the face of the unknown"" isn't a big revelation for me.  Instead of a room full of poorly developed characters who were all shouting the same thing, I much preferred the intense scrutiny of Sally Sparrow's character becoming obsessed with Time Travel. Try as you will, there is no arguing that the black waitress sacrificing herself carried any of the emotional weight we felt when Sparrow's would-be-boyfriend showed up aged and dying in a hospital.  It was even a plot point that no one knew who the stewardess was.

Midnight is a bottle episode.  I love bottle episodes, but they are controversial, so give another point to Blink.

Finally, Blink stands up as a piece of art in its own right, while Midnight is in a little more need of the Dr. Who context.  We discover who the Doctor is with Sally Sparrow, while we're supposed to know what a sonic screwdriver is, who the Doctor is, who Donna is, and, most importantly, who Rose is when she shouts at the Doctor through the TV.  A noob watching Midnight might end up asking a lot of questions.  ""Why won't he tell them his name?"" ""Who is the Ginger at the end?""

true,Spoody,null,null,"I know a little about this, as a friend of mine was nearly suckered into it.

To start from the beginning: She was applying for jobs in the PR/Marketing field, and mentioned a job she was applying for, the ad required no previous experience and offered a good wage. I've worked in PR for a couple of years and know the job market so I immediately thought it was suspect, and decided to do some research on the company.

This is how it works: They put out loads of job adverts like that one my friend saw, and if you apply you're invited along to an interview (everyone who applies), which is generally in rented office space. A day or so later you get a phonecall saying they'd like to invite you to to an 'observation day' where you'll work alongside someone. When you get there it turns out that what the job actually entails is exactly what you describe; door to door (usually pubs/offices) sales of utter shite, 100% on comission.

The person you get partnered with is someone getting paid, or they fell for the scam a few weeks ago and were 'promoted' to team leader, and promised more soon. They'll spend all day telling you how they're making a mint and how brilliant it is and blah blah.

So, the people at the top buy loads of cheap shit, and get (almost) free labour to go flog it. They change names every five minutes, and have extremely fake looking websites (copy and paste template style) to lure people in at the initial stage when it's advertised as as a PR/marketing job.

It wouldn't surprise me one bit if the poor sap you met had been promised that pub would give him a free drink with a meal for selling there.

Can't remember the name of them (at the time my friend applied) off the top of my head, but I'll see if I can dig it out for you, there were hundreds of horror stories involving it when googled.

Edit: My first edit disappeared for some reason, but here are some links:

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt; When Sky merged with BSB they formed a near on monopoly over the market. 

BSB was not in the best of health. They were tied up in red tape and regulations. 

The government, pursuing a pro-British policy, required that they a) launch two satellites with very limited capacity, to be controlled by BSB (but can only use one of those satellites at a time, the other was a backup), that there could only be 5 channels, and that the MAC video standard was used (a British invention with superior picture quality, but also required custom, expensive to design and make hardware).

Meanwhile Sky had no such regulation. They could use existing satellites with more capacity, and commodity hardware. Sky was cheaper (it had much lower operating costs) and better - and thus more popular. They were well entrenched long before BSB got started.

BSB wasn't going to last if they didn't do something - and merging was for the mutual benefit of both companies.

&gt;  If News Corp decided they didn't like ESPN News because they gave them a bad review or voiced opinions opposite to Rupert Murdochs, News Corp are now allowed to cut them from the broadcasting list, essentially sending them under.

Nope. Sky cannot stop any channel from appearing on its EPG, unless it breaks the rules (none of which are ""because we don't want you"" - Ofcom would have its say if they did anything like that) or doesn't pay the fees to do so (which are set by Ofcom). Sky doesn't own the satellites, so it can't stop anyone from transmitting. Astra and Eutelsat (the satellite owners) will welcome anyone with the money.

Relations between ESPN and Sky are quite cordial. Sky knows that it can't have all the sports rights; it isn't allowed to, so ESPN buys them and Sky and ESPN work in concert, not against each other. History has shown that belligerency doesn't work - ITV Digital went bust because they tried to overreach in terms of sports rights, Setanta tried it too and failed. ESPN is only mildly unprofitable and it has the might of the Walt Disney corporation behind it.

Technically Sky is refusing new channels to appear on the EPG because older Sky boxes are running out of memory, but any channel that wants to be on Sky can buy an existing channel's EPG position. Sky itself has had to do this to launch its own channels.

&gt; Any channel whose market share is made up mainly from Sky subscribers won't be able to say a bad word about News Corp, or its politically motivated owner. Bad words may include ""The Tories have done something they shouldn't have done.""

Utter rubbish. A lot of the channels on Sky's EPG aren't even subscription channels. By the way, it'll be Labour who are in bed with News Corp next. It's not a Conservative-only phenomenon.

true,TheMemo,cnty-uk,Bristol,"Having lived in the US (well, Florida, if that counts) and Bristol in the UK (currently), I can point out some differences.

As mentioned by others, English people are not very outgoing or particularly friendly compared with people in the US. In the US, I was amazed at how often people would chat to me, how friendly people were and the almost relentless air of optimism. Comparatively, we are a fucking depressing people. And, yet, a lot of us are more political than our US brethren despite having no hope of changing anything (witness the protests against the Iraq war for example).

Our weather is, also, often depressing, but rarely an intolerable extreme. Snow, despite being a semi-regular occurrence, is cause for alarm in the media every single time. 

Bristol will not seem civilised to you. For us, a 24-hour supermarket is worthy of note, but in the US, a Wal-Mart or Super Target that isn't open 24 hours is an oddity. The same goes for fast food establishments and almost everything else. Our gas stations do not have Slurpee machines. We have no 7-11s in Bristol. We do, however, finally have a couple of Krispy Kreme shops, which is nice. (But no Wendy's, Arby's, Chik-Fil-A, or Taco Bell. Not even a Steak n Shake or Cinnabon). Our Mountain Dew is rubbish.

The English are incapable of doing anything competently and efficiently. From dealing with British Telecom (BT), your Broadband provider of choice, utility companies, HMRC, to getting signed up with / treatment from the NHS (as a foreigner), getting a bank account, or getting your Visa, you will be assailed on all sides by more bloody-minded bureaucracy than you have hitherto experienced. Corporations, especially, seem unprepared to deal with foreigners - especially if you, say, don't have a chip-and-pin card or your pin number exceeds four digits. Or you have a surname which has no vowels. Or they don't like your face.

While we do have stupid, old religious laws (that cause issues for late opening, and sunday opening, of shops as mentioned above) we are a remarkably irreligious people. The common attitude from the Church of England is that it is all just an extended metaphor, really. Very few Christians even seem to believe in the existence of God, Jesus, Heaven or Hell. This may or may not be a selling point for you. We do, currently, seem to be seeing some fire and brimstone preachers in Bristol, and we'd be obliged if you could take them back to the US where they belong as they are interrupting our godless ways.

Our public transportation system is better than that found in most places in the US, barring large cities. That is faint praise indeed. You will probably want a car, if you have not had a heart attack and dropped dead over the prices of petrol.

Our telecoms infrastructure, while not that great, is a considerable improvement over the US. Our local exchanges are 'unbundled' in Bristol, so many broadband providers compete to offer you service. Almost the entire city area of Bristol is now set up for Fibre to the Cabinet, which offers 40Mbps downloads and 10Mbps uploads. There are only a handful of providers that offer Fibre services, though. Do not choose Virgin Media, despite their tantalising 100Mbps service. You will regret it, for their traffic shaping and traffic management is extremely aggressive.

English people enjoy getting drunk to an extreme that you may be unprepared for. Vomit covers the streets on a Friday and Saturday night, and it is not uncommon to see large fights. 

Politically, our leaders, as with those in the US, are stupid, greedy, short-sighted and fail to understand even the most basic principles of modern life and technology. They are the biggest drivers of mediocrity aside from our aging and creaking school system (which is still, seemingly, better than what I have seen in the US).

I have lots more to add, but shall leave it there for now.

true,jgroome,english,"So I typed back ""lol ok""","Thanks so much for the explanation.

The [Wikipedia piece](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virgin_Media#Television) about Virgin's TV market share is not cited, and the only [cited note](http://stakeholders.ofcom.org.uk/market-data-research/tv-research/dtv/dtv_2007_q3/) is from just under four years ago. Is there a more recent link to back up the 30%/5% split? Either way, 65% market share (assuming that's what you're implying) is not a monopoly.

&gt;If News Corp decided they didn't like ESPN News because they gave them a bad review or voiced opinions opposite to Rupert Murdochs, News Corp are now allowed to cut them from the broadcasting list, essentially sending them under.

That makes it sound like Hugo Chavez's shutting down his opponents' radio stations. It also sounds more like baseless paranoia than an actual concern. Do we have any evidence of this happening before? Also, why would Sky go out of their way to alienate ESPN News' audience? Forgive me if I'm wrong, but customers can cancel their service when their contract time is up and take their business elsewhere.

&gt;Any channel whose market share is made up mainly from Sky subscribers won't be able to say a bad word about News Corp, or its politically motivated owner. Bad words may include ""The Tories have done something they shouldn't have done.""

Again, this just looks like fearmongering. Have we got any evidence that this would happen? How is this different from the anti-AV crowd's baseless nonsense about having to close hospitals and put soldiers at extra risk to pay for a new voting system?

My main issue with this argument is that it's framed to sound so definite. Instead of saying ""there's a risk that dissenting views will not be permitted to air on Sky-owned services"" (which is itself quite a general and baseless thing to say), the argument is ""this *will* happen, and it *will* happen *like this*"". It's an argument that can't be supported, and only persists because people are put off by Murdoch's little empire.

Occasionally on Reddit people form various organisations are invited on for a Q&amp;A session, these are referred to as AMA's (ask me anything), people are generally very polite and there are moderators on hand to keep any unruly questions in hand.

As a large part for the community are from the Americas it would be nice to have any AMA later in the day so more people could take part.

Please let me know if you think this is at all possible, it has been a opportunity in the past for organisations to get closer to the fans and spread the word of our great football club.

As for capitalism, it has produced the fastest rate of technological development man has ever seen. It isn't without it's flaws, and it is the case that the balance has tipped too far in the favor of huge multinationals, but I would argue this is more a case of corporatism than capitalism, especially when it comes down to lack of regulation. So yes, the liberal democratic government, in combination with a regulated free market and a social welfare system is the best form of government we have developed so far, however China may change this but the next century or so will be crazy, so who really knows.

As for the metrics of literacy, life expectancy etc being only relevant to my point of view, I don't think this is the case. Would you like to see a decline in any of these metrics in the UK or would you like to see them rise?

I think you should look at history more, especially the improvement in conditions our rapidly developing society has brought. We as a species have come so far, and things have improved so much. Look at the rights women have, or the rights homosexuals have today compared to the early 1900's. Look at the improvements in living conditions or health care. Look at things like the minimum wage. It's a disservice to everyone who worked and fought for improvements to disregard the sheer progress we've made as a species so readily.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt; I think you're confusing the freesat range and what Sky does. Sky doesn't have to put any channels on air at all. 

No. I am not sure how Freesat does things but Sky has little control over what goes on their EPG - apart from for technical reasons (lack of memory in their older boxes means that there are no new slots available).  Even when they started doing that, Ofcom looked into it to make sure it was fair and reasonable. 

From the Ofcom code: http://stakeholders.ofcom.org.uk/broadcasting/broadcast-codes/epg-code/

&gt; In particular, EPG licensees are required:
to ensure that any agreement with broadcasters for the provision of an EPG service is made on fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory terms;

&gt; to ensure that viewers are able to access all television and radio services included in the EPG service on the same basis, provided that the viewers are equipped to use the EPG service and to receive the relevant programme services;

&gt; to ensure that free-to-air services are at least as accessible as pay TV services, and that reception does not require additional equipment or commercial agreements over and above those required for the acquisition of the receiving equipment; and
to refrain from imposing any condition in an agreement for EPG services between an EPG operator and a channel provider specifying exclusivity to one EPG for any service or feature, including the ability to brand services and access to interactivity.

Sky cannot force a channel into a specific package - it is up to the channel concerned. A channel that wants conditional access services (aka encryption) has to pay Sky handsomely for the privilege. Hence, a lot of channels on Sky are not encrypted, and don't require a subscription or card. 

Sky does not put anything ""on air"", except for channels that it owns or channels that have contracted with Sky to do it. Many channels don't rely on Sky for transmission or satellite space - only for an EPG slot which as I have said is tightly controlled and regulated to stop Sky doing what it wants.

Presumably this applies to all EPG services - so the Freesat consortium and Sky have to follow the same rules.

&gt; Why are you so keen on Sky? Have shares in them?

Nope. Just don't like people who don't know what they are on about - and it seems that any mention of News Corp brings on the hives in some people. Scaremongering increases 1000% percent, even when it consists of things Sky is not legally allowed to do.

Blink was just a very boring horror movie, at least until the very end, when the Doctor showed up to offer a little bit of the complexity that is time travel/reality.  That little bit wasn't anywhere near enough to compensate for the intellectual vacuum that was the rest of the ep.  And this one was annoying in a similar way to Midnight in that they both featured more than one mostly ""stupid"" and unrealistic, shallow characters doing something ""evil"" for most of the episode.  It's bad enough that these sorts of unrealistic/uncomplex individuals show up now and then in the show, but to have whole episodes filled with them is just pointless in my mind.  At least Midnight allowed some complexity in the characters sometimes, and there was character development with some of the folks, but the ""big bad"" didn't seem to do anything other than ""be evil"" though the entire show, which doesn't offer me anything to relate to as a complex being who knows that all living things are motivated by creation and growth.

""Read some books"" isn't an actual answer is it, it's avoiding taking the information you've read and coming to conclusions from it. Your conclusions are what I'm interested in, not just a list of books to read.

Tribal society has it's problems, mainly that they won't scale to the populations we have, especially as we move to more urbanization and more mega-cities. Dubars number comes into effect here. 

Communism does sound nice is theory, but the problem is that it would only really work in a post scarcity society (and almost by default in that situation). While we have scarcity we have a problem of people wanting more than their fair share, or feeling entitled to more. So it essentially comes down to rationing and black markets.

Kerala is a representative democracy, which just happens to favor more left leaning candidates over other parties. Same with Venezuela.

Feudal society I find interesting that you raise, given that it was largely subjugation of the population by the aristocracy, the various revolts against this system eventually resulted in the establishment of our current system of democracy after hundreds of years.

I worked for these guys (one of their subsidiaries anyway) for a couple of years in the residential gas &amp; electricity division, so have some direct experiences to offer.

I joined shortly after the gas &amp; electricity markets were deregulated and companies could poach customers from areas other than their own.  
To promote competition the regional suppliers weren't allowed to drop their prices for a number of years. This was to allow time for competing companies to move in and acquire customers.

It was during this period I was knocking on doors signing people up to change their gas/electricity suppliers.  

We'd basically ask the person to get one of their gas &amp; electricity bills and we'd show the rate they are currently paying and what rate we would be charging.

If the people hadn't already switched to another supplier they'd see around a 25% saving. It was a real saving and not a con, although there were other companies who were marginally cheaper than us.

As it was a genuine saving it was a pretty easy sell, although you'd still get the vast majority of people who will simply refuse to deal with door to door salespeople (I include myself in this demographic).

We were paid on a 100% commission basis and received £15 for every completed gas contract, £5 for electric, and an extra £3 if they paid direct debit. Later on when the phone markets were deregulated we would get an additional £7 if they signed up for the phone service as well.

We worked ridiculous hours. Getting to the office at 10am and spending a few hours practice pitching with the new guys. This was followed by a team meeting where everyone who did well on the previous day gets praise. There's also usually some kind of daily incentive announced.

We'd start knocking doors at around 1pm, taking a 30 min break at 5pm, then continue on knocking doors until 9pm (which is when the law states door to door selling is not allowed).

We'd also work 1pm - 6pm Saturday, which was usually one of the highest earning days (as more decision makers tend to be in).

I was doing pretty well and earned around £500 a week. The average was more like £300 with people who are doing really poorly earning £100 or less. Generally, people belonging to this last group didn't tend to stay around long. There were an awful lot of people in this last group, but they'd come and go pretty quickly so the actual percentage of people earning fuck all wasn't so bad.

To get your money the customer has to stay signed up for at least 90 days. To this end, 25% of your commission was held in a bond with any cancellations taken from this. Once you've worked there for three months the remainder of your first months bond is released, then every month you get you bond back from the three months previous. This was quite nice as if you had few cancellations then at the end of every month you get a nice fat 'bonus' cheque. If your cancellation rate was over 25% (IE you're useless) then you could actually end up owing the company money.

That was the selling part. 

Then there was also the bullshit ""Someday you'll own your own office and be earning millions every year""...

Once you've made a few sales you'll get promoted to 'team leader'. Pretty much everybody gets promoted in their first couple of weeks, the title is meaningless as you don't actually get paid more initially. 

What you do get to do is take people out on 'observation days'. People who get through the interview process go on an observation day with one of the team leaders (everyone gets through the interview process).

If you manage to convince the person to take the job they then join your team and you get 5% of anything they make (not 5% of their commission, 5% on top of their earnings). To get this 5% you have to first train this person to be able to sell stuff. Most people who take the job are pretty hopeless, but you train them anyway because you never know.

After you've done the observation thing about 20 times you might eventually find someone who can stick the job and earn a decent wage. Bear in mind that you might only get one or two observations a week. Less if one of your observations takes the job and you spend weeks training them only to find they're shite.

So once you've got a new guy who's making money they'll start taking observations out, if they get someone on their team they get 5%, you get 1%.

Once you've got a big enough team and it's making over £5000 a week (this amount varies from division to division) you get 2% of the entire team's income. You don't get the money though, it goes into a fund which will eventually let you move out and take your team to another city to set up your own office.

Once you have your own office, the office you were previously at earns a small percentage (can't remember how much exactly) of everything your office makes.

Bear in mind that it can take years to get enough quality observations to get a decent team together and the 'own your own office' thing is largely bullshit. Although it can and does work, it's only very occasionally.

There are lots of divisions though, and the process varies slightly from division to division. Here's a couple I can think of off the top of my head:

* Residential utilities: This is what I did, look above.
* Business to business utilities, these pay substantially more than residential, and the commission is based entirely on how much energy the business uses. One guy I know earned £10,000 off one contract (this is pretty much unheard of though).
* Charities division where people stand on street corners hassling pedestrians to sign up to a monthly donation to some charity, or go door to door.
* Credit division, where you stand in motorway services getting people to sign up to credit cards they don't need. They also go to football &amp; rugby matches signing people up to the club's credit card, where the club makes a miniscule commission whenever the card is used.
* Direct sales division: This is how the cobra group first started, selling cheap Chinese tat door to door, business to business, pub to pub (and everything in between).
* Promotions division: Go door to door selling discount vouchers to restaurants &amp; pizza places (kind of like groupon but a direct sales version).

Some of the divisions pay terribly and bond a shit load of your commission, charities and B2B utilities being the most notorious for large bonds.

**TL;DR**  
If you're good at selling or have a likeable personality it's possible to earn decent money, very long hours though, and the advancement opportunities are largely there just to get you to train people for free.

I understand that there have been many societies prior to the one we live in now and most of them didn't seem that bad, certainly not to make me think that democracy is any better. 

Due to the massive nature of western civilisation, our capitalist democracies are raping everything. Do I need to prove this to you? 

Attilla the Hun was less harmful. Maybe life with the Mongol hordes was pretty rotten, especially if you were a woman or an enemy, but they could only destroy so much. 

Democracy has made the population comfortable and docile so we can't act in the interests of future generations. That really sounds like the best system ever. 

Sure Feudalism meant that people were subjugated but maybe less than we are now. The common folk grew their own food, had good holidays, beer and community. Doesn't sound terrible. 

Democracy is not freedom. I can imagine lots of better ways to exist and some have already been done. 

Sorry I can't write you a thesis. I don't have the time to assemble the facts and figures, I am not trying to prove anything to you. I am questioning your gormless thought process, is all. I don't think you are interested anyway.

true,Spoody,null,null,"&gt;Once you have your own office, the office you were previously at earns a small percentage (can't remember how much exactly) of everything your office makes.

Am I right in thinking at this point they get a new name, which is why there's so many very similar ones? They should call themselves the Hydra Group not Cobra....

Since you were 100% comission did you have to register yourself as self-employed? What happened with taxes/NI?

What you were doing seems reasonable enough to me, if they didn't falsely advertise the jobs, and were upfront about it, I don't think I'd have a problem.

All the lying, bullshit, selling tat, and layer upon layer of commission is what makes it a borderline scam/pyramid scheme imo.

Interesting read - thanks.

Yes, everyone in theory is a self-employed independant contractor, you have to sort out your own tax &amp; NI (an awful lot of people didn't pay any). You weren't offered any help with this.

&gt; Am I right in thinking at this point they get a new name, which is why there's so many very similar ones? 

Yes, that's exactly it. Each office is totally independent, with the cobra group supplying the clients. The clients pay the cobra group for every signup, they keep some for themselves, give a bit to the guy who caused that office to come into existence (basically, the guy who trained the person who runs the office), and pass the rest to the office where the contract originated from.

Each office is free to divvy up the remainder any way they like. Some owners pay their guys fuck all and keep as much as they can, some put a decent percentage into a pot for incentives, perks &amp; prizes, some pay their guys more, some pay the trainer of the guy who made the sale more.

In our office it went something like....


    Cobra group: 10%
    Office: 90%
        Office manager: 30%
        Office running costs:20%
        Prize/perk fund: 5%

        Contractor's trainer's trainer: 1%

I called an ambulance to my house and took me to closest large hospital, stayed most of the night in a hospital and got a cast and crutches. 2 weeks later (and after a bit of chasing up) got an appointment to see a specialist in the same hospital. Took of my cast and recommended me to do physio in the hospital closer to where I lived. Had another appointment a couple of weeks later and doc said I was good to go and that's that. Total Cost - £ 0. (Well I bought some ibuproen but that's about it) ",0,1309462668,null,0,false,0,c22vfkw,t3_id538,t1_c22vfkw,t3_id538,1427301816,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

true,djhworld,uk,London/Nottingham,"Pros: -

* NHS
* Full time employers usually offer 4-6 weeks of paid annual leave (vacation time) per year. 
* You can buy alcohol/liquor from supermarkets and corner shops instead of faffing about looking for liquor stores
* TV is pretty good (especially the BBC) - commercial channels don't have as many commercial breaks as they do in the US....and most of the adverts here don't continually peddle prescription drugs and litigation services....although you will find many adverts for sofas and yoghurt for bloated women.
* Banking is largely 'free' (i.e. you don't have to pay a monthly charge to open and use a current account)

Cons

* Britain can feel a bit unsafe at times, the police presence is nothing like it is in the US, you won't find many cop cars or cops patrolling.
* Not many UK homes have air conditioning - This isn't usually a problem but during the summer, on those rare occasions where we get a heatwave, your house can get really really really hot which sucks, especially at night.
* Housing is incredibly expensive, especially in the South of England.

Take the *Game of Thrones* and *A Song of Ice and Fire* subreddits.

/r/gameofthrones takes its title from the HBO TV series, and everything about the subreddit's style screams ""This is a subreddit for the HBO TV series!""  /r/asoiaf takes its title from the books.

You'd think that TV discussion should go in /r/gameofthrones and book discussion should go in /r/asoiaf, right?  So that TV viewers can have a subreddit without having to worry about book readers spoiling things?

Well, don't try and suggest that over in /r/gameofthrones.  Book discussion continues, particularly now that *A Dance with Dragons* will be out in 2 weeks.  But say one word about dividing TV and book discussion between the two subreddits, and it's all, ""Ser Ilyn, bring me his head!""

TL;DR - even if you make another subreddit with the intention of separating types of discussion, it won't work, and those who subscribe to the subreddit will get personally offended if you suggest that they should perhaps take their discussion of *A Storm of Swords* into the subreddit named for the books rather than the TV show.

true,Dipshit_Alert,null,null,"Upvote for critical thinking &amp; trying to be reasonable. I don't know the answer - haven't followed the case closely - the point I want to make is, this is exactly the reason there's a jury. If the system works (which I *hope* it does, and *think* it does *most* of the time) the jury have seen the evidence and there has been fair representation of both sides. 

We, on the other hand, get our info on the case from the media. The media's job is to make money by selling us advertising, via newspapers and websites, which in turn means making stories attractive to read. You don't make much profit with a dispassionate analysis of the facts of the evidence: we want heroes, victims and villains. If the accused is sufficiently ""interesting"" to titillate the press, pieces of evidence that support whatever story they're telling will emerge. (Off the top of my head, think about the way Amanda Knox was portrayed)

So, to come back to your question: in this environment, what *ought we* to think about the case? In my opinion, we don't need to decide who's innocent or guilty, and if we do (which, let's face it, we all do sometimes) we have a responsibility to be aware of our lack of knowledge. And not go around forming posses. 

So - if we're interested in following a case like this in the media, I think your reasonably-expressed scepticism about the mainstream view, is *exactly* the right attitude to have. (Which doesn't mean the mainstream view is wrong, either.)

Oh, and if you've not read [The Outsider](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Outsider_(Camus_novel), your post neatly describes one of the themes of the book IMO.

Players like Aquilani are good, but looking at that would be like saying meireles had more assists/goals then xx, goals you could count, but his assists are not from open play. Charlie adam has like 4 open play assists and most of his goals are set piece/penalty.

I would rather have aqua (with KD and SC working on him) than say adam, but Modric shouldn't be compared to aqua on the basis of assist. One has insane passing and movements and the other is good player with a room to improve. And you can see this by looking at what clubs are after them, if you don't believe me.

It surprises me that people think it's acceptable behaviour for a complete stranger to visit your home with a video camera, interview your neighbours, and publish pictures of your residence and family, simply because you wrote an embarrassing email. 

A reddit user behaving this way would be roundly condemned.

From the [Planning Committee Agenda](http://www.middevon.gov.uk/CHttpHandler.ashx?id=15561&amp;p=0) under ""Enforcement List Item 2"" pertaining to ""Oak Top Farm"":

* April 2006 - Oak Top Farm is occupied by the family

* August 2006 - A retrospective application for the siting of a temporary agricultural workers mobile home is refused by the planning committee.

* 1st September 2006 - ""An Enforcement Notice [is] issued...with a requirement that [the occupiers] 'cease the unauthorised use of the land for human habitation and remove all items associated with human habitation from the land, in particular one (1) caravan, two (2) wooden sheds, one (1) wooden cabin and a plastic awning'.""

* Legal proceedings...

* November 2007 - An application for ""the retention of a mobile home for use by agricultural worker and improvements to existing access"" is refused by the planning committee.

* More legal proceedings...

* 23rd October 2009 - Judge issues Injuction forcing the family to comply with the Enforcement Notice in full.

* 7th December 2009 - The family sells the land to another party, fulfilling their compliance with the Enforcement Notice.

* 16th February 2011 - Officers discover that the new owners are illegally living on the land.

My opinion: City planning and zoning are good things.  The land currently in question ([Muxbeare Orchard](http://www.muxbeareorchard.com/)) is set aside for agricultural use.  However, the type of intensive agriculture that the family is pursuing would necessarily require inhabitation of the land.  Having looked through the family's [website](http://www.muxbeareorchard.com/), they seem very competent at what they are doing, and the type of agriculture that they are pursuing seems like it would be of long-term benefit to both the land and the community.  I think their pursuit should be commended, and given the type of agriculture and the family's level of commitment, I think they should be granted inhabitation rights.

And thank you to Linlea for the quality info.
