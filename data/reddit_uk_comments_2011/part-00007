- To the Jurassic age to see a Deinonychus (no sissy Velociraptors for me!)

No, wait, then I don't get to meet Jefferson. Well, then, 1800 to watch the election - d'oh, then I can't see Washington! DECISIONS. I'd like to see the republic *after* the revolution, but would settle for during the war, I guess, if I could make the rounds of the founding fathers. :D I've always really really wanted to crash at Mount Vernon or (even better) Monticello while the owners were still alive...

- I'm tempted to also say 1943-4ish Germany, because that time just fascinates me but I know I couldn't do that emotionally. Nuh-uh. So...I guess 1969 to watch the moon landing!

- Definitely Rome at the height of the Empire, as per another commenter

- Any interesting place in America during the civil war. Would prefer Gettysburg (although again, I don't know how well I would do being on actual battlefields).

yes, I agree banking needs big reform. I agree fiat currencies ""created"" by banks is crazy. Your points are all great and worthy of discussion. What I don't like to see is people saying ""get rid of all the bankers"". The British badly need to be educated in economics so they can separate good activity from what is as you say lies. We are in the mess we are in because people cannot ask questions like ""if house price growth continually outstrips inflation, what does that mean in say 10 years time?"".

Until we educate ourselves we are just sheep. This doesn't excuse banking behaviour etc, however my suggestion (plea) that we all try to think a bit more would help matter, unlike the ""burn the bankers"" groups.

Most people don't seem to see money as being in a cycle, that we have to tax before we can spend. There was another question about why we can't just continue to let our debt grow forever.

true,abw,null,null,"&gt; If so, you should know that at least 3 co-authors retracted their views after being shown the new data with which Oxbridge's surveys have been coming up.

Wasn't that because of the yellow puddle incident?  The way I heard it was that the BFMC were sitting on the paper pending the investigation and subsequent hearing.  The 3 authors in question voluntarily removed their names from the paper so that it might be published.

I don't dispute the relevance of the Oxbridge paper, though.  And I'm sure I read that both Peterson and Golding acknowledged the findings, even if they weren't available at the time their paper went to press.  But I don't think it would have change the ultimate conclusion that they reached.  That is, that the technology allows a more thorough analysis of a much wider range of data than is possible by traditional means.  Although it still requires a skilled and experienced player to analyse the data and formulate the appropriate strategy, of course.

In summary, the technology won't make you a good player, but it will help good players develop game strategies that encompass a wider transition network.  The advantage is admittedly very small (typically less than 2% is the figure that Wyles and co propose and the Oxbridge  data suggests it might be as low as being entirely sub-parity) but I'm sure you'll agree that as the general standard of play improves and the competition gets fiercer, the dedicated player will seek out and utilise any advantage that they can get, however small.

This is my own personal experience. I left university and was aware of a few internships which I was encouraged to apply for. They were in Manchester and London, both of which, far away from my home. Naive as I was, I thought this was a great opportunity to get my chance in ""the industry"" and looked at logistics of moving and where the cheapest places were etc. It wasn't until I enquired about every ""job"" that I found out that there were unpaid. No expenses, no nothing. Now my parents are not wealthy people and were struggling to keep up payments on their own house, especially seeing as my dad's a self-employed builder and his work is prone to dry patches. Simply, there was no way they could afford to pay for rent, transport and food for me living far, far away. What about myself? What newly graduated student has a disposable income big enough to pay for a few months rent when they are unpaid, full-time?

So, I thought. I'll take a year, get a crappy job and put some money away and go for an internship then. Problem is it seems noone wants to take on a graduate who has been out of school for a year, they want kids fresh and wide-eyed straight from uni. 

I knew a few people who managed to take on the internships and they're both still in ""the industry"". However, one had the fortune to live in London anyway so could stay with parents and the other had a wealthy dad so working unpaid wasn't a problem.

If they're cutting pilots, should they cut the best, experienced pilots who have already been flying for years, and are very, very good at what they do, or should they cut the trainees, who haven't even finished being trained yet?

If they cut the trainees they lose the least-capable pilots, and save themselves the cost of their remaining training.  If they cut experienced pilots they lose their most valuable assets, and have to pay to finish training recruits who won't even be as good as the guys they lost.

I completely agree, it was really difficult for me personally, and I wouldn't have been able to do it without breaking a few rules because neither of my parents would have been able to support me financially as neither of them are particularly wealthy. I was signing-on and doing my internship, which was against the rules even though it was free. Apparently you can do internships if you're on New Deal though.

&gt; If you work for a company why shouldn't you get paid for it? 

Well, if you're good enough to work for a company to the point you deserve to be paid then you should go and get a paid job.

Heres why some employers don't pay interns a wage.

* You may invest months in a given person, after they've got to a level where they merit being paid, they jump ship meaning you've lost many hours and thousands of pounds.

* When an intern is at intern level it can be hard to judge what their aptitude for a given skill is, if they turn out not to be that able after a few months, you may have wasted thousands of pounds training someone.

* Intens, including when I was one, in my experience, initially take more than they give.

true,back-in-black,english,England,"&gt; OK lets now stop with the patronising language.

I have not patronised you. I am attempting to explain certain concepts to you, such as the idea that an attack on an argument is not an attack on the individual deploying that argument. I am baffled by your insistence that describing a simplistic argument as simplistic is an attack on the person using that argument. It isn't. 

&gt; You and I obviously differ with regards to the government economic policy. Fair enough. But you've pulled the argument pro-government people always pull when faced with someone that doesn't agree with the cuts - you've branded the other persons ideas as 'simple'.

Okay. Lets go over your argument again. 

You think that retaining jobs in the public sector will prop up the economy. This overlooks the fact that all public sector jobs are ultimately funded by private sector jobs, okay? This is pretty basic stuff. People who work in the private sector pay tax, and that tax is used to for (amongst other things) paying people in public sector jobs. *All* of the money in the public sector has ultimately originated from the private sector. 

Now, if your nation is in some kind of financial crisis, one approach to get out of it is to *borrow* money, or to *spend* some money put aside, and use it to hire public sector workers and keep people in work. But if you think about it, even for a short period of time, a few things become obvious:

1) The cost of borrowing must be low, if you mean to borrow your way out of the crisis. 

2) If you have *saved* money, you must have saved enough to spend your way out of the crisis. 

3) This is only a short term solution.

4) Your public sector workforce must be a lot smaller than the private sector workforce. If it isn't, you are not going to be able to raise enough money. 

Now the problem with the current situation in the UK is that:

1) Borrowing is expensive, globally.

2) We have no savings. 

3) Our public sector workforce is approaching the size of the private sector workforce. I.E. Our public sector is very large. 

Therefore, it follows that we cannot spend our way out of this crisis by hiring, or retaining, large numbers of public sector workers. The obvious answer is to then somehow expand the size of the private sector. So how do we do that? How do you encourage private sector growth? You have to make your nation a more attractive place to do business, both for home grown companies and for international corporations. 

IMO, your argument is a simplistic one, because it shows no understanding of the points I've outlined above. I am not calling *you* simple, I am outlining your lack of understanding of where the money to pay people comes from and why some approaches don't work under certain conditions. 

&gt; Just because an idea doesn't take pages and pages of complicated graphs or whatever to write DOESN'T mean it's wrong. 

I've just explained it in very simple terms above. It didnt take reams of graphs or figures. 

&gt; I actually think your core argument of public sector = bad, private sector = good is 'simple', but I didn't say that to you, because saying that to you doesn't constitute a proper argument in a debate.

I've just given you a case in which you can use the public sector to help a nation out of an economic crisis, and just I've explained why we can't use that approach. So obviously I do not believe that ""public sector = bad"", do I?

&gt; By your reasoning, only trained economists should be allowed to talk about the economy.

Not really. If you're going to talk about fixing a nations economy then you'd better understand some basic concepts in economics. Just as if you want to discuss Evolution you'd better understand the concepts of inheritance and mutation. 

&gt; What's the point of letting people vote then? Pick any random person from random UK town and I can bet they won't pull a huge wad of spreadsheets about government spending out of their pocket when asked about the defecit.

No, but I bet if someone explained the above to them, they'd understand. You don't need ""a huge wad of spreadsheets"".

&gt; However, because we live in a democracy, their opinion about what should be done by their government about their country is just as valid as someone who's an economist for the FT.

No. It. Isn't. That is why we have a representative democracy, rather than a true Ancient Greek-style democracy. It is exactly because the average voter *does not* understand the complexities of the issues that many politicians face, that we have the political system we do. The populace *does not* vote directly on economic policy for a good reason.

&gt; Your line of reasoning leads to the situation where the 'ordinary' people should just keep quiet and accept everything they're fed by the government.

No. I just expect people who want to set economic policy to have a basic understanding of economics. Otherwise, why should anyone take you seriously?

&gt; Yes it IS insulting to tell someone their argument is 'simple'.

Not if their argument is *actually* simple, and they can't seem to grasp some fairly basic concepts. 

&gt; I'm an atheist, but when I meet a creationist I don't tell them that they're 'simple', I say 'If you look at X evidence you'll see that Y'. You couldn't be bothered to do that after talking about the corportation tax so you made an attack based on your personal prejudices (you are pro-cuts so everyone else must have a 'simple' argument).

No. I would listen to a counter argument from someone who understood the situation we were in, as outlined above, and had found some alternative approach or argument I hadn't thought of.

I knew a lot of people who did a generic degree with no particular job in mind. There was a post somewhere else on cambridge's financial support so there will still be people going and if people will be paying more for it perhaps there may be more commitment

Having worked in payroll in a major county council I've seen thousands of £'s wasted on bonuses to upper managers and members of staff with stupid hiring polices just cos they've got the budget for it. I hate seeing people lose their jobs is shit (I got made redundant in the private sector before ending at the council) but I can see there's a lot of excess which can be cashed in elsewhere.

Now I'm back in the private sector (at the old job I lost before the council) earning bugger all as its a job that I like rather than an ambitious move and there's finally a bit of help in the paycheck but the change to the taxes this april. Rich people dont need tax benifits for having kids so there's a little bit of help for underaverage paid people without kids like me an my gf.

I just need to win the lottery so I can afford something bigger than the uk's smallest 1 bed room flat which no government combination is ever going to fix. I'd love somewhere cheap but I like the little greenbelt land we have left in the uk.

I'm really not up for conspiracy theories, especially ones that span decades such as manipulating cycles. I'm sure there is manipulation but not on anything like that scale. If they could organise economic cycles over 25 years why not just engineer stability and at the same time invest in the things they know are going to prosper and get rich that way? Or just manipulate oil now and again with a careful spread bet. ZeroHedge is full of such theories including September 11 conspiracy, etc. 

I believe it's a combination of a few quite not as smart as they think, greedy people and a lot of dumb, lazy, really greedy people. This combination would certainly allow mass sub-prime lending in the US and UK without some kind of decade long sub-plot.

To put it another way, I keep abreast of as much information as possible, and I'll politely disagree about Zerohedge (which is one of many I follow) as 'most' of the articles are very good financial journalism compared to the MSM. Personally making money (I trade metals and forex) from many of the articles also helps solidify opinion greatly. 

Likewise, buying physical metals every month since 2007 and trading oil up to $147 (then down again to $30....) all came about from investigating under the covers of the MSM.

So what did we find out here? That hackers tend towards bitchiness. That people who are extremely computer literate often have poor interpersonal skills. That fledgling organisations often have a period of messy power struggles between the egos at the top.

I agree with some of your points but disagree with your collective punishment approach. If kids are being neglected or abused then fine, involve Social Services. If people are evading tax then fine, set HMRC on them. If it is dangerous for police to enter a premises then fine, give them the tools to do so safely. 

Where I do fall out with you is that you still seem to be taking a them and us approach. (I am also uncomfortable with your ""don't contribute to society"" approach, unless applied to Tories of course. *Reductio ad absurdum*: I personally have just jacked my job in. Does that mean I am not contributing? Are you coming after me?) You say ""we will not accept their behaviour"". Who is ""we"" because I'm not in it? Who are ""they"", unless you are going to define all members of a group by their birth? You say that this is not racist. Technically this is correct, it would be hard to define them as a race, but then it would extremely hard to define to look at a self-defined jew's DNA and say that they were jewish. Does anybody here want to say that anti-semitism has not been a problem in Europe's history? I am not Godwinning you here. This is not meant as a gratuitous analogy to shut down debate. I am trying to explain why I get angry about this point. This is real. The Nazis *did* define gypsies as a specific group and they did send them to the camps. Throughout British history we have defined gypsies as an out-group and persecuted or excluded them. This is the logical extension of your argument. Defining a group as a problem based on the behaviour of some of them and applying collective restrictions or punishments is the same sort of behaviour as racism, it is just as wrong, and it is potentially just as dangerous.

true,SendInTheNinjas,null,null,"I did apply. After sending off the generic 'tell us your qualifications' form, the maths test was the next stage. It was online, and you were given 20 minutes to answer 20 questions, so you had to work at 1 question per minute. The thing about the questions was that they all contained huge amounts of data in graphs/tables/whatever, so by the time you'd actually read that, your minute was up. Also it would be  'how is X related to Y', but you first had to work out X by looking at A B &amp; C. My boyfriend was sat next to me trying to help, and by the end of it I was in tears and he was extremely stressed. 
 
The scheme was advertised as being open to people from any degree background, but it obviously assumed that you had a very, very high level of competency in maths and that you did maths A LOT. The thing is, I graduated in history and haven't done maths since I was kicked through GCSE. It would be similar for someone who'd studied English Lit, Politics, whatever. If they wanted a 'highly numerate' person, they should have made that clear and I wouldn't have applied. Putting the maths test as the first hurdle was also, in my mind, very unfair to arts/humanities students because I never got a chance to prove myself in all the other tests (the next test was verbal reasoning). I ended up wondering what exactly they were looking for in a person who could complete that test, because *anyone* would struggle to get it all done in the time given. It just seemed like they were looking for a robot.

There's simply no statistical evidence for this, as oblio points out below.

&gt; Third is optimistic, fourth will be a challenge (but one we can do if we play like we all know we can) but sadly fifth is my prediction - based solely on class in depth at each position where we still lag behind Chelsea, Citeh and to a lesser extent Liverpool.

Third is certainly optimistic, though not unattainable.  I don't think fourth is the reach you seem to think.  At a glance it seems like lack of depth is currently crippling us, but aside from the Fulham disaster this rash of injuries has allowed guys like Kranjcar and even Jenas to step up and pull their weight, and the result has been W W W.  It hasn't been easy, but it's been doable.

If we can get Bale and Modric back on the pitch I would say our concerns should largely evaporate.  This season we've beaten Arsenal and Liverpool and drawn with Chelsea, United and City.  People have a tendency to draw enormous conclusions from just a handful of games, and I can't think of a clearer example of this than post-Kenny Liverpool.

&gt; In Britain, the share of working-aged people who are out of work - over a quarter - is unusually high.

Most of them are well off, economically idle but non benefit claiming.

That includes 1.3 million [pensioners](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/this-britain/britain-becomes-a-nation-of-pensioners-1059449.html) and a few million [disabled](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/7173453.stm).

&gt; The recession may have caused the numbers of unemployed to grow, but 4.5 million people were living on out-of-work benefits even before the recession.

..which again includes disabled. The unemployment figures were 1.5 million and the claimant count was less than a million. We had some of lowest unemployment figures in the world.

&gt; And the largest number of dependents, 2.6 million, claim to be disabled and are living on incapacity benefit.

true,MrMustard,null,null,"I've leased a few cars in my time and there's nothing really to worry about but there are certainly downsides as well as advantages. 

The main points are as follows:

1) Leasing only works if you don't do large amount of miles per year. Like mentioned above you are given a number of miles per year you are allowed to do in the contract you sign. If you go over this number you will be billed at a pre determined amount per mile (normally between 7 - 13 pence per mile, it will be in your contract). You can negotiate the amount of miles you are allowed to do before you sign up but remember that the higher your mileage the higher your monthly payments are going to be. 

2) make sure you read the contract regarding Road tax. Most leases will include road tax in the monthly price you pay but I've run across a couple where they only include the first year and you end up paying the road tax separately for the subsequent year/s. 

3) Make sure you can afford to pay the monthly lease payments and will be able to do so for the period of the lease. I've not run in to trouble with this but I'm sure there will be some hefty penalties if you need to egt out of the deal early. I suppose it all depends on who you lease with but the only way I know of getting out early without a considerable penalty fee would be to try and get someone else to take over the lease. So only lease a car if you know you will afford to do so even if your circumstances change such as losing a job etc. Unlike where you purchase a car via bank loan etc, there is not the option to simply sell it and pay back the remainder at any time. Look at the contract being offered and find out what penalties and options you have regarding early termination.

4) You will never own the car. As long as you appreciate that you are more or less renting and that you simply hand over the car at the end of the contract then there will be no  misunderstandings ;)

5) Most leasing companies are relatively liberal with minor stone chips / scratches etc but I've heard that some companies (I'm looking at you Mercedes) can be very strict on what they expect back and bill you for anything after they pick up the car. Obviously if you have serious scratches or dents then you need to either get them fixed before you hand back or expect to be billed for damage but most will be lenient on normal road damage such as stone chips and small shallow scrapes.

The upsides to leasing are:

There's no massive upfront payout. Normally you just pay 3months worth as the first payment and away you go.

You have a new car that's covered by manufacturers warranty and you'll always have a new car as long as you are leasing. there's no MOTs to worry about and if it breaks down the dealers have to sort it out.

The road tax is normally paid for.

Now the downsides:

Good luck in getting out of the lease if you need to without a significant penalty payment. Hate the car? Tough. Lose your job? Tough. You would be very lucky in getting the lease company to find somebody to take over the contract. I've never had to do this so far though so may be wrong.

Watch your mileage as if you go a few thousand miles over your contract allowance you will get a bill for a few hundred quid at the end of it. It's normally not too bad unless you really cane it.

That's about all I can think of at the moment anyway.

____

The offence is created by section 5 of the Public Order Act 1986:

    ""(1) A person is guilty of an offence if he:

        (a) uses threatening, abusive or insulting words or behaviour, or disorderly behaviour, or
        (b) displays any writing, sign or other visible representation which is threatening, abusive or insulting,

    within the hearing or sight of a person likely to be caused harassment, alarm or distress thereby.""

This offence has the following statutory defences:

    (a) The defendant had no reason to believe that there was any person within hearing or sight who was likely to be alarmed or distressed by his action.
    (b) The defendant was in a dwelling and had no reason to believe that his behaviour would be seen or heard by any person outside any dwelling.
    (c) The conduct was reasonable.

We went to help him up and his indian doctor literally snapped at my mum ""to let him get up and go himself."" She went apeshit at him and the staff there.

The state of the healthcare system in this country is, quite frankly, despicable and heartless. I'm glad my mother and I were there to have a right go at the staff and get my Grandad looked after better. There were a lot of elderly people in that ward that didn't have the benefit of family that could visit often, if at all, and it broke my heart to know that they were probably being mistreated and left in pain, alone, surrounded by people who they could barely understand and couldn't give two shits about them.

I also pray now, that if my family are ever in hospital, that they don't get treated like that. I'll probably get arrested for what would ensue.

Fuck the tories and their NHS cuts and reforms. Quite literally fuck them. I agree that cuts need to happen, but stop taking it out of the healthcare system and instead stop giving millions in aid to countries developing space programs rather than helping their people.

this is more serious than you think. i'm a primary school teacher and can tell you that i see evidence of this every day. it can be a minor point from an adult's perspective but children *crave* attention. imagine getting home from school and being ignored. no ""how was school? what did you learn?"", being read a story, asked about friends or even just  to talk through things that happened during the day.

it leads to a massive drop in confidence and self esteem. at school the child craves attention *in any form* (good or bad). they can start acting out agressively or become withdrawn. if it happens from an early age you can kiss goodbye to a good education. as other children progress, they don't. as they get older, school gets very hard and they don't want to go. they skip school, miss learning and end up in a very bad position (socially, emotionally and academically) before they start secondary school.

if the neglect, and it is neglect, starts from birth it's essentially abuse. i once taught twin boys who at age 5 could barely talk (let alone read or write) because they'd been raised by the television. their parents had hardly spoken to them, read to them or listened to them (again, no encouragement or praise, no playing games with mum and dad). by the time they left primary school they were still *years* behind.

my point is the long term damage can be as disastrous as physical or sexual abuse.

If this guy got charged it's because either he refused to admit guilt (possibly hoping for jury nullification or judicial reappraisal of charges, both common in the UK) or because his police record already contain similar infraction; then again the popo might simply have though this petty crime which almost certainly won't get a conviction was worth wasting the courts time with.  
  
Possibly they felt a charge was needed to impose a restriction order (banning him from going to the Manchester) although if this is the case then it's almost certainly lazy police scared of the paperwork involved in applying a restrictive licence to a caution.)  They didn't mention of course what he was 'bailed' to - they do however add 'pending further inquiries' which likely means he's bailed to return to the police station to accept a charge / caution or have the charges dropped...  This little loophole means they can apply a limitation to his actions without making an official charge -he'll turn up at the police station on the 25th and get a slap on the wrist mark against his record or a stern talking too and no official charges.  
  
-I'm not a playmobile-policeman though, i know this because i've been officially cautioned (a technically impossible) three times for the same offence and 'unofficially cautioned' about half a dozen (without going to the copshop) -oh and i did some of the study to be a legal observer for protests, that covered most of it too.

true,kaosjester,null,null,"Could you elaborate on what you mean by the 'deus ex' of Rose? And I feel like the only reason that it was okay for Rose to be crushing on the doctor was because, deep down, he felt it, too. I liked Martha because she approached things rationally and intelligently, and even though she was ga-ga over the Doctor, she realized it was just emotional and managed to eventually deal with it. To be honest, I kind of hated Donna; she had this eclectic collection of knowledge that, usually by magic, seemed to apply to the situation (like her explanation for the dating system in The Doctor's Daughter). That aside, I didn't find her character too agreeable. 

Amy is a neat companion, but I feel like she's getting a little stale. Rose, Martha, and Donna all progressed as characters, but I feel like in a whole season Amy is still, well, Amy. I feel like they're trying to set up another Rose dynamic, but I would suspect the Doctor would be a bit more bitter over the whole Rose thing still; it was only a few years ago. And Amy is clearly head-over-heels for him, but it's like he's her nice cousin that won't let her do something she'll regret. And all that nonsense with Rory and the Doctor being 'her boys' makes the whole fifth season feel a bit like it's focused around Amy exploring in the Doctor's fantastic machine with the Doctor just tagging along to keep her out of trouble. In fact, the Doctor even mentions at one point that it's ""all about her"", because he had already seen it all. It just seems like the Doctor is getting short-changed in the dynamic.

Meanwhile, Rory has grown leaps and bounds. I'd really like to see the Doctor and Rory off together, as in the episode with the fish-people. The male dynamic with the new doctors feels much more comfortable than with his female companions because the sexual tension isn't there (with the exception of Jack). To be completely honest, though, human males are typically far too stubborn for the Doctor's taste long-term. I would really like it if he picked up an alien companion; its been a good several doctors since that has happened.

Really, though, I'm ready for him to just move on and start travelling with River Song. In fact, I think it would be *fantastic* to set it up this way:

* Amy gets pregnant, so her and Rory decide to settle down instead of continuing to travel. It's sad, but they have each other so it's really okay. 

* Then, before they leave, something crazy happens and there's this giant fiasco and Amy and River and Rory end up all together (maybe the Daleks show up and ruin everything).

* Amy reads the first two-three pages of River's journal without her permission and tells the Doctor where to go to find River the first time.

* At some point River gives The Doctor a blank version of the journal.

* The Doctor, lonely and wanting a companion (maybe he travels around alone a bit first) eventually decides it's the way to go about it and goes to first meet River, giving her the journal to record things.

* They travel together at least through one regeneration.

true,Shaper_pmp,null,null,"&gt; what I am trying to get at is that we, as a society, hold some things to be 'sacred'... That is part of what defines us.

Interesting point.  I believe, however, that one of the most important things that defines us should be tolerance to other people's opinions and attitudes, even where they may conflict violently with (some of) our more subjective beliefs.

Most importantly, I think, we can still hold things dear without having to invoke the *law* against people who don't agree.

Ultimately it comes down to the old adage: ""sticks and stones may hurt my bones, but names will never hurt me"".  Injury or pain is clearly demonstrable and involuntary, so I have no problem with punishing people who unnecessarily inflict those.  However, *anyone* can take offence at *anything*, so I think it's incredibly dangerous and counter-productive to start *legally* punishing people just for offending someone.

I'm unsure how you can make the law more pro-tenancy and how this will help. Fair rent schemes might help, but most of the rental property stock seems to be in private hands. The problem isn't evil landlords, but more a lack of places to rent. People aren't building as many houses, and not as many people can afford to buy-to-let the ones that do come on the market. Social housing does take over some of these buildings, but not all of them. Empty house seizure I do agree with, but I think the 6 month limit is too short, I would make it 18 months.

Mortgage regulation does need to be looked at as well, but more in the case of preventing people from taking on loans they cannot afford to repay. If you capped mortgages at 3.5x earnings, then given the average salary is around £30K then hardly anyone would be able to afford a house.

Yes; fair rent schemes extended to private landlords to stop them raising rents unfairly, as they do.

I don't think that is true. High rent costs seem just to be proportional to house prices, and aren't governed by supply/demand as much as they should be. Landlords just tend to charge what they think they can get away with. If there weren't enough rental properties, then we would have much more homelessness than we have, as the private rental market is the housing of last resort for most.

If you put a cap on the mortgage limits as low as 3.5x earnings then you won't force the price down to meet demand, you'll just stop people in houses being able to move, and prevent people from buying who might be able to manage a larger mortgage. People still need housing, it's not something they can do without. All that will happen is people and firms with assets will be able to buy up more housing and more people will have to rent.

Of course it does. That is basic economics. There aren't enough rich people in the country to meet the demand at today's prices.

&gt; If you put a cap on the mortgage limits as low as 3.5x earnings then you won't force the price down to meet demand, you'll just stop people in houses being able to move

&gt; and prevent people from buying who might be able to manage a larger mortgage.

People thinking they could afford a larger mortgage than 3.5 times their income is why we have this problem. If someone thinks they could afford a more expensive house, they would simply have to put down more money in cash.

&gt; All that will happen is people and firms with assets will be able to buy up more housing and more people will have to rent.

That is why you implement a fair rental scheme, so that any company that rents out a house cannot charge considerably more than the equivalent cost of a 3.5x mortgage.

true,ezekielziggy,eng-sussex,Sussex,"The strongest currency is not always the best option. If you have a strong currency it can weaken your ability to export to other countries, it can restrict your growth. When economies face tough times, their currencies usually fall, allowing them to gain advantage in the global market, helping the countries back onto the road to recovery. You also have full control of your interest rate policy and the ability to engage in quantative easing. You are also less subject to the rules of other countries (fiscal independence ect ect). 

When you have a shared currency you basically lose a lot of control over your economic policy. The nature of a shared country means that two countries could be in two entirely different economic conditions and the European policy makers would end up taking a decision that would not be in the interest in at least one of those countries. 

Want to increase lending in your country? I'm sorry but it would not be in country A,B and C's interest to reduce interest rates. 

Are your businesses struggling to compete with overseas manufactures as your currency is overvalued/too high? I'm sorry but it is not in the interest of A,B and C to devalue right now. 

The point I'm trying to make out is that a strong currency isn't always a good thing and when you lose your national currency, you also lose a lot of the policy tools that come with it. ",0,1297809923,null,0,false,0,c1gxskm,t3_fls8e,t1_c1gxskm,t1_c1gxlta,1426919904,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

They already meddle by changing interest rates. Changing interest rates have more profound side effects than anything mortgage regulation might produce, so any alternative would be an improvement. 

For instance, interest rates are one of the key factors in controlling the affordability of mortgages (and loans in general of course). The government can use high interest rates to stifle inflation in the housing market, but can't do so without reducing the disposable income of current home owners. The knock on effect on the rest of the economy is enough, in the medium term, to undo any temporary reduction in inflation. You end up back at square one. If the government could control house prices via mortgage regulation, then they would be free to keep interest rates down for the benefit of the rest of the economy.

&gt; The most simple change you could make would be to seperate investment banking from retail banking, which reduces the amount of speculation in housing and associated debt. 

Agreed, that's part of it (although I don't think it would be simple change). It would make the banks less likely to offer anything more than 3.5x mortgages because they would find it harder to repackage and offload the risk via obscure financial instruments. But it is just a different way of achieving the same result. Doing both would be the best solution imo, as the mortgage regulations would catch any banks that attempt to side step the investment regulations.",0,1297816141,null,0,false,0,c1gy9x8,t3_flq61,t1_c1gy9x8,t1_c1gy27l,1426920130,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

False analogy: you don't have a choice about whether you're punched or not.  You *do* have a choice about whether you take offence at something someone says.  This can be trivially proven simply by deciding *not* to take offence at anything someone says to you - if ""*not* taking offence"" is a choice then ""taking offence"" must necessarily be one too, even if it's one many people take without even thinking about it.

&gt; You ask ""Who gets to define what is offensive and what isn't?"". As I have said elsewhere, surely that is something that defines the society.

But not everyone in society agrees, so what do you do every time someone takes offence at something?

* Do you never prosecute anyone unless everyone in the country agrees on it?  Then you never prosecute anyone, ever.
* Do you prosecute is a majority of people agree it was offensive?  Then you have to pay for a national referendum every time someone's arrested like this.
* Do you have some absolute size of group or proportion of the population who needs to be offended before you prosecute?  If so, how many, and with what justification? (Hint: I sincerely doubt you could put anything other than a totally arbitrary figure on it, and certainly couldn't defend it in debate)
* Do you prosecute if *anyone* gets offended?  Well then, as I've said elsewhere half the posters on this comments page would be spending the night in jail, because I find advocacy of draconian censorship *deeply* offensive. &lt;:-)

Offence is subjective, and (worse) you can't even always *know* what will offend someone until you've said it and they've decided to take offence at it.  We've all had the experience of accidentally offending someone we didn't intend to... so now you can be made a criminal *after the fact*, at the *whim* of another person.

Also, the intent behind the action is important - its entirely plausible that the fan never intended to *seriously* offend anyone - he could have made the plane gesture meaning ""Man United are going to crash and burn"" (never considering the 1953 crash), or he might have meant it only as a cheeky but non-serious insult.

Ultimately prosecuting someone for ""giving offence"" is like prosecuting them for ""being funny-looking"" - it's such a subjective, arbitrary and inconsistent judgement that it's completely unworkable - it's either applied inconsistently (very bad in a law), never enforced under any circumstances (making it completely irrelevant), or most of the population are immediately imprisoned, and the remaining few free citizens never go anywhere or say anything, self-censoring for fear of offending someone and ending up in prison at the arbitrary discretion of someone else.",0,1297851394,null,0,false,0,c1gzonx,t3_fluy6,t1_c1gzonx,t1_c1gwvgk,1426920794,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

Since the credit crisis highlighted the fact that the banks were literally conjuring money out of thin air with no legitimate backing, it's a lot harder to simply demand more credit now, especially as we're still printing money to provide legitimacy to all these toxic loans.

I think there's a reasonable range of coverage of news stories, though there are doubtless more Guardian/Indie posts than those from other papers/magazines.  Obviously it doesn't help that you have two major, credible open access centrist/liberal/progressive dailies with fairly extensive coverage, but only the Telegraph providing similar output from the right.  The Daily Mail isn't really comparable for many reasons of quality and coverage and the Times (even if people are prepared to overlook Murdoch) is now a closed shop.  


My personal policy is to vote up whichever post first covers a major story from whichever of the major dailies and then to either ignore or vote down all duplicate stories unless they offer more details, new developments or an interesting new angle.

Both great cities, though the appeal of the Fringe Festival starts to wear off in Edinburgh after a couple of years.  It just gets annoying not being able to move around your own city and everybody jacks up their already over inflated prices.

I'd recommend Manchester over Edinburgh, though.  It's more central, with better transport links than Edinburgh, meaning you can get to anywhere in the UK quicker.  You can be in North Wales, the Peak District, the Fylde Coast, the Lake District, North Yorkshire, the Midlands etc. in less than an hour, and London in about two/three hours by train.

Further, there's a load of Irish in and around the North West, so you won't feel completely out of sorts (virtually everybody has an Irish or Scottish surname, and the accents are heavily influenced by the Irish accent).

Manchester is also a hell of a lot bigger than Edinburgh, though still smaller than London, and doesn't feel like a massive metropolis.  The night life is a lot better in Manchester than Edinburgh, as is the shopping.  (Edinburgh's shopping is terrible.)

- The video you linked doesn't seem to be about the NHS. 

- The health ranks you linked show Britain at a very respectable 18, way above, say, the US, which is often quoted as having a higher cancer survival rate.

- I have been presented with cancer survival statistics before, investigated myself, and discovered that the types of cancer are cherry picked. Some cancers we have better survival rates, some we have worse survival rates. By only reporting certain types of cancer, those who oppose the NHS are given a daily mail headline ""NHS causes cancer!""

- I would expect the cheapest available drugs to be used. The cheapest available drugs are always used. This is not an effect of how the health service is structured.

Or even simpler: approval voting -- putting a cross next to any candidates you approve of (which is just the n=2 case of range voting).  Very simple to explain -- ""Vote for as many candidates as you like"".  Very non-pathological.  And barely loses anything relative to range voting (since strategic voting would mean that practically everyone would only use ""0"" or ""10"" in range voting anyway, in which case you may as well have used approval voting).

Depend's on the opinion, in this case absolutely.  

&gt;My mother died last year after a four year battle with lymphoma (no need for any polite sentiments) and we blindly thought she was getting the best treatment until I sat down with the help of google and a few forums. Within an hour I discovered that she was not getting the correct treatment because the NHS deem it too costly. We asked her consultant about this and he admitted that his private patients would receive the more effective drugs. Try sitting in a room and being told that.

I can agree that that's pretty shitty, but it doesn't mean that there is anything wrong with the NHS... It is unlikely that other than paying for yourself that you will get every treatment going, especially when a treatment isn't cost effective.  

That applies in the NHS as much as it does under any other system, including in a private insurance model.  Take the row that blew up over Lapatinib and Pemetrexed for example, cancer drugs that were shown to extend life by up to 2 months but cost somewhere in the region of ten thousand pounds per patient (and not all patients would see the benefits of a 2 month extension of their lives...).  

The end result was that NICE (Or was it the trusts?) decided quite rightly that they were not cost effective.  Hell, looking at Pemetrexed (Altima in the US) you can't get that in the US if you are insured, on your insurance, you would have to pay for it yourself..

So, essentially people need to make decisions, funding is finite, but the costs are lower with an NHS than without it at any given level of provision.  

Now as to cancer survival, I agree, the UK has a lower survival rate than most of Europe, but that is only one data point... More to the point the US has really good cancer survival rates, but lags almost everywhere else (and even more so when it comes to access).  Oh and the UK is seeing improvements year on year...  

The point is that the idea that the NHS is fundamentally flawed is pretty daft, the idea that we need to change it to some sort of market based, competitive private equivalent is absurd, we need to make sure that we invest in the NHS and that it continually stays on top of issues...  After all I'm sure the NHS could achieve US levels of Cancer care and survival if the UK spent US levels of money on the NHS, of course that would mean spending three times as much as we do now...

I'm a little confused by this.  Voting in a safe seat essentially means that you are in a minority, it means that the majority is likely to gain the seat.  Now granted a PR system on a national level may mean that each vote counts toward something, but it doesn't mean that every vote will be represented. It also breaks the constituency system entirely and essentially destroys the local element and the individual element of UK politics, we end up with party positions and nothing more.

&gt;AV may or may not be the answer, but it's a small half step in the right direction, and voting it down will cause the formation of more governments with super-majorities, who trample the rights of the people like what occurred during the last thirteen years.

No, instead we see massive power handed to small fringe groups and governments not really representing anyone.   If you want protection of the populace from governments with majorities then you need to look at the lords (any government will by default have a majority and, if elected on national issues, will be more intent on election success than doing the right thing, which in any PR system will entirely be about populism...).

Oh and the FPTP system has been around for far longer than the last 13 years and 'trampling' (if you insist that's what the last 13 years was about..) has a far longer history than that.

AV simply balances the votes, allowing a vote for a minority party to not be a wasted vote and bringing some more variety and such into our politics, and giving people more representation. 

I would like to see more fringe groups in politics, both right and left wing.

One of my favorite moments of the last election was seeing Caroline Lucas being elected, because while I'm not a particular supporter of the Greens, I love seeing more variety and viewpoints in politics. All we seem to have under the current system is [GENERIC PARTY IN POWER] and [GENERIC OPPOSITION], one of which puts forward it's views and the other which blindly shouts them down. It's frankly absurd how things operate.

And yeah, I know FPTP has been around longer than the last 13 years, but an AV system would be more likely to avoid such travesties as what occurred then. 

And to address the massive power being given to fringe groups point, I think we've seen with the Lib Dems that even a fairly large part of a coalition doesn't really have any power anyway, so I doubt it'd change much.

Whatever people say about FPTP, it's a shite way of electing representatives. It encourages ""strong"" governments (who ignore the will of the people who elected them anyway), but as we've seen in the US and here, those aren't necessarily better than ""weak"" ones that they have in Germany or in much of Europe. 

It's just a matter of opinion, but in mine FPTP has failed, and needs to be replaced before even more of our population loses all connection with politics and the governance of our country.

Don't feel that you need to watch every single (extant) episode - most of the mythology that you are familiar with from the new series was exposed in very small bits over a long period of time, and there are frequent contradictions before settling on what will eventually become canon. For instance, the words ""Timelord"" and ""Gallifrey"" were never even *mentioned* until near the end of the second Doctor's time, and  the pacing of the show really didn't pick up until the end of the third/ beginning of the fourth Doctor eras.  

I think a lot of the Hartnell stories are great, and I love Troughton's Doctor, but, for me, Pertwee and Tom Baker are the golden age and the truly ""can't miss"" episodes.

The idea of forcing people to work under the minimum wage will create more unemployment and undercut those who would be employed usually, on a large scale it could create a new effective minimum wage, if inflation isn't doing that enough already.

And on his final point I do somewhat sympathise, we shouldn't be condemning people to waste their lives in menial work when it can be automated for the benefit of all. We could automate as much menial labour as possible and share the products such that we can afford to educate those made redundant to work in areas where they are truly required, and it would also allow us to put an end to unemployment and relieve the work burden on all, as if we collectivise the means of production then there is no longer any need to exploit the maximum profit out of each employee and we can instead share the load over many.

There are technical difficulties to doing this (not that I agree anyway). In theory, you are supposed to be able to get part time work and deduct accordingly from your benefits so that if you get £165 per week from JSA and housing benefit and you earn £60 you would get the rest topped up. In practice this is fraught with difficulties because the system is so fucked up. By trying to earn some money you risk having benefits stopped for months while two utterly useless organisations - the DWP and your local council, try to do the unfeasibly difficult maths involved. It's shoot first, ask questions later. 

And why would you want to condemn your fellow humans to the hideous and meaningless grind of menial work? Just because you or I have to suffer should not mean we wish the same upon our fellows. What kind of ethos is that? If someone has a way to survive without the soul-crushing depression of minimum-wage employment - good on them.

Just because you or I have to suffer should not mean we wish the same upon our fellows. What kind of ethos is that? If someone has a way to survive without the soul-crushing depression of minimum-wage employment - good on them.

Except that it's not good on them. They've resigned their selves to living off the state indefinitely. Only able to live because others are doing what they don't want to. There's no ambition, no aspiration to better theirselves so that they might be able to do something other than menial work. It's not a way to survive, it's a way to be lazy, and if the benefit vanished tomorrow they'd really be up shit creek.

In answer to your 2nd question, the point of ""utopian fantasies"" like this is simple. Because while this type of technology will never arrive as fast as geeks have dreamed about, it will arrive faster than most people expect. Already there are factory's which use a fraction of the people they once did yet make more due to machines, and this isn't going to go away. Supermarkets are replacing checkout staff with machines. As technology improves more and more roles will be replaced by machines, computers and sooner or later AI (the firm I work for makes and sells IVR systems which are designed to intelligently replace call center workers with computers). This type of stuff is already here, it's already changing the nature of work and it's not a fantasy.

What was your reaction to that? Personally I volunteered full time for 6 months on £55 per week in order to get further in my career, it was a rewarding and fulfilling time. Yes I hated doing menial jobs like cleaning minibuses and making the teas but it's not all fun and games in any job.

If people know that the alternative is easier, why are we surprised that some people choose to take that route? Personally I love having a ps3 and a laptop, I like taking holidays and doing fun things. Someone on £65 per week is not going to be able to go to California for a month like I did. 

I fully support getting people on job seekers out into their communities to do some good. Of course the media pounce upon this and scream about how unfair it is to get someone on job seekers to pick up litter or to clean graffiti like a criminal. Is it though? I don't think so.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt;I amazed you are using justice as an argument for NOT working and effectively living off the work of others.

I don't mean any offence, but I think you are ignoring the bigger picture of the culture and society into which we've been born. 

We live in a strictly hierarchical, class based society in which a tiny proportion of people own the vast majority of the resources and exploit this majority for their own ends and in ways that are non necessarily to the benefit of the exploited. 

Had we been living in an egalitarian society in which sharing and collaboration were seen as the greatest virtues instead of selfishness and accumulation on personal property, you might have a point. 

But the guy in the interview is faced with an unjust and, in my view, cruel social system which is so clever as to have convinced even it's most dejected subjects that it is virtuous and fair. 

&gt;It sounds to me like you have come up with some elaborate and delusional justifications for your own situation and lack of desire to work.

It seems to me you don't understand how we are forced into miserable and pointless labour by the economic system that benefits the few at the expense of the many. 

&gt;By the way if you don't want to do a menial job (very understandable) I would suggest either more education or trying to start your own enterprise - even if just on a tiny scale.

As it happens, I work for myself and what I do is largely brilliant (I teach people how to play music and play music for the entertainment of others). Also it pays enough that I can live comfortably (on a minimal income) on part-time working hours. 

I don't think you have a very broad perspective if you think the solution to people having to do menial work is to tell them to get an education and start a business. If nothing else, all you have to do is see how few jobs are available to graduates these days. Plus, if more people started businesses, the existing businesses would surely lose a proportion of their incomes. 

Using myself as an example, I am in an already competitive marketplace for students, there are not an infinite number of people in my area who need music lessons. If many more teachers appeared then I would lose some of my income. It seems logical that this applies to any business. If too many people open restaurants or taxi firms or whatever... 

Bearing in mind, as food prices rise, people are going to spend less and less on other stuff. 

&gt;Sitting on your backside is not contributing to society. 

You are just being patronising now. Shame on you. 

I have been in this situation, so your presumptions are not entirely without merit, but you have now revealed yourself. 

I don't think that working in an uncertain and low-paid job which allows you to barely survive despite back breaking work is contributing to society. You have convinced yourself that participating in the economy is contributing to society is an elaborate delusional justification for your own situation, working a meaningless and unsatisfying job just to be able to afford a meaningless and unsatisfying lifestyle which is designed to keep you perpetually hungry (in the abstract sense) and dissatisfied (ooh, we can all cast aspersions, can't we). 

&gt;If everyone felt like you we would be transformed into a 3rd world society 

Having lived in a third world society or two (well, two) I am aware that the worst poverty is horrendous and afflicts far too many people. However, it is possible to live with a lot less than we take for granted is necessary. If people are well fed and housed and are, by and large, equal and able to interact with each other in a positive way, most of what modern wealth brings does not have to seem very important. 

&gt;and you wouldn't even have the Internet to keep you occupied during the empty days.

What's wrong with empty days? I like empty days, myself. I like entertaining myself with the internet. I also use it for work. When I am not earning my money in my part time and very fulfilling occupation bringing others enjoyment through music I am happy to just poodle about, why shouldn't I? I can't afford to do much else anyway. But I am content. If the internet wasn't here, I would occupy myself whittling soap or writing poetry or playing monopoly or something. 

I'd love to know what you do to contribute to society.

I do stuff that is useful enough to other people that they are happy to pay me to do it.  I also do a lot of work that is voluntary, and which I don't benefit from monetarily, but I can only afford to do that work because I also do work that I get paid to do.

I'm currently ""skilling up"" while claiming JSA.  Problem is my course is going to take two years (electrical installation), so until then I'm in the same boat of having little skills on paper and the longer I'm on JSA the less companies are willing to give me a shot.

I also find that the low skilled jobs are the ones that require you work shifts (6-2 / 2 - 10 / 10 - 6) which in turns means I couldn't do the job and continue going to college.  So my option is take a low paid job and stop going to college, then have no chance of progressing in the future, or continue going to college and struggle on JSA.

People say lower your expectations, I've applied for jobs like window cleaning, waste operative, delivery driver . . . . yet I just can't seem to catch a break.

It's hard out there for people that went to university, it's REALLY hard for those will no skills on paper.

Another good thing is that soon the housing benefit won't cover my rent, so I looked online to find cheaper places to rent. . . . . there's not much out there for less than what I'm on, I found one place which was a little bit cheaper, yet they don't take on DSS.

I keep reading about people claiming loads of money and living a life of luxury on JSA, could someone point me in the direction of how to go about that, because from my experience the only thing you can afford to do is stay in and eat very cheaply. . . . . how do I go about getting these huge TV's, loads of beer every week, free cars?!

Those already are jobs. Jobs that could be filled if we had the money to pay for them. Unfortunately they are just the kind of jobs we are about to get rid of in the necessary cuts. In fact the cuts mean removing essential workers.

None of those jobs would go undone if you were paying a wage.

I too would be happy to see fewer soaps/sport etc, generally everything that doesn't interest me. I mainly watch BBC4 documentaries, I certainly can't expect everyone to pay for them though.

Those podcasts you mention sound interesting to me also. I would have thought that, if there were a market for programming like that, then someone would be providing it, but I don't know of anyone who is. Most non BBC documentaries I have seen are appallingly bad. As are most non BBC channels. 

I can't really see how closing the BBC would result in higher quality programming. Certainly it would mean that people would no longer have to pay the licence, it might, theoretically, allow the BBC to abandon its more populist programming and concentrate on making good documentaries. But again, if it were possible for a TV channel to do this, why has it not happened already, in the US for example? While there is good US TV (I liked the Sopranos, and The Wire for example), there does not seem to be a channel which can produce quality drama AND quality documentaries, arts coverage, comedy etc. And this is without taking into account the news, radio stations, childrens programming, and things like iPlayer and the websites.

So it seems to me that the free market in TV is unable to provide anything like the service that the BBC does. All of which is available to everyone, at a very low price. Should the BBC become a subscription service, providing intelligent programming, it will no longer be possible for a person bored with xfactor to switch channels to something like 'Life on Earth', without a pay barrier. I can only believe that would be a bad thing, will result in more dumbing down etc.

Ideally, as production costs get lower, and the internet provides distribution, good programmes will be made. But again, I am not seeing much evidence of this happening. Instead I see the internet becoming the new marketplace for the kind of companies that produce the kind of TV which I think is tripe. The end result, I think, will be that both TV channels and the internet will be dominated by dumbed down programming, while good programmes struggle to survive in niches, behind paywalls, largely ignored.

I can understand why the right wing dislike the idea of the BBC. It's under threat now, I am not sure it can last in its current form. If it goes, we will lose something unique, a national resource, producing a vast array of programmes, some tripe, some absolutely fantastic. I think people like you and I will be less well served by TV, and I think that people who like xfactor will also be less well served, as they lose the choices in viewing they currently have.

I work for a living and I think I'm lucky, I work in IT and I enjoy it.  If I end up redundant tomorrow I'll look for another IT job.  In in the meantime, I'll take any job I can get.  I have a mortgage to pay.  I have bills to pay.  I have my own goddam self respect that I'm going out there and earning the money to meet those responsibilities that allows me to sleep at night.  I don't want to be kept by the state.  I'm a fucking man for god's sake.

As a society, we should ask ourselves the question: what value do we want to place on a human life?

Currently that answer is approximately zero, zilch, nothing. Combined with the enduring human instinct for survival, some proportion of the society will always be lead to crime. And how does the society address that? Invent some authority figures and have them enforce inhumane punishments on

What the Conservatives may or may not have done prior to their taking power is irrelevant - they didn't rack up deficits and they didn't fail to regulate the banks.

Of course, they can be blamed for any failure to do so under the current coalition government, and I think we need to wait and see what happens.

&gt; Any bank that received a bailout from public money (a repellently socialist notion in itself) should not award bonuses. Tax loopholes should be closed so larger firms have to pay their share of tax.

Perhaps the then Labour government should have been more stringent when it came to bonuses and profits, when it arranged the bailouts?

&gt; The argument that 'Vodafone and Boots generate lots of VAT and jobs etc so they should be able to avoid as much tax as they can' doesn't hold water

Vodafone's case seems a lot less clear cut than that. This is a long standing case that started a decade ago and no one (including VF and HMRC) seems to know the facts. 

&gt; They benefit from the infrastructure of this country that is paid for by taxation, 

What do these companies give back in taxation, jobs (and taxation), etc? They might avoid tax, but are they still companies worth keeping on the good side of? If they are more of a drain, then it might be worth considering saying ""goodbye"" to them. If they contribute more than they ""take"" in avoidance (and TBH avoidance is not ""stealing or ""taking"" anything - they are simply arranging things to reduce the amount of tax. Tax that the state has no business taking,  as tax avoidance is perfectly legal)

Why is it bogus? Why is it suddenly a bad thing that companies are avoiding tax now that a new government is intent on making us live within our means?

true,[deleted],null,null,"Well yeah, but we didn't produce the financial crisis. Though, I guess it is more inherent in the economic system in general as increasing unemployment and the competition for employment (with outsourcing, automation, etc.) is driving down our wages and purchasing power which creates a crisis in demand as we cannot afford to buy the goods being produced at profitable prices, which leads to redundancies as the businesses try to stay afloat and worsens the situation. We tried to offset this with the easy availability of credit, but that isn't sustainable as eventually the debt becomes unprofitable and a liability, and the whole system starts to collapse. [Albert Einstein wrote an excellent essay on it, as he thought it was the cause of the Great Depression.](http://www.marxistoutlook.com/article19.htm)

While they do provide employment and pay taxes, they don't do it out of compassion for the country, only because it is currently necessary, and I am sure they will expend every effort in reducing both or threatening to relocate elsewhere. If the banks were nationalised we would gain more national revenue and still provide employment, it is literally a win-win situation for the people of this country.

true,benfitzg,null,null,"Hi - sorry but you have completely the wrong end of the stick, from my perspective at least. It is precisely because the BBC has a guaranteed revenue stream that is it detached from the onerous cycle of populism. When ITV produce a program they have to do market research, prove that N million will watch program X then attract advertisers to pay the same or more than the program costs to produce. Meanwhile the BBC has a cake and has to decide how to cut it. How ""value for money"" is defined makes the difference. The last government thought value for money was driven by viewer figures.

If a BBC program is popular the question has to be - given that this could cover it's costs in advertising, what is the point of producing this on the BBC? It could be made on ITV at no extra cost.

The BBC is there to produce programming that is *not* popular, but is considered worthwhile. How to decide what gets made if not by popular demand? I'm not sure. One possibility is that it's decided by an elitist group.

I certainly would not casually destroy the BBC. I like some BBC radio (content that cannot be subsidised by trivial images). It's far better than ITV. I'm arguing that if the BBC is populist it can be done by the private sector. If it retains public sector funding it must be non-populist, ie elitist.

true,logrusmage,null,null,"&gt;Why does a Timelord with a TARDIS almost exclusively visits the modern day United Kingdom?

He crashed in a particular time line originally and has simply been revisiting it because it's his favorite.

&gt;How come wherever he goes, there's either a mystery or individuals are in trouble? 

Simple explanation here: The TARDIS is psychic and contains a piece of the time vortex. It senses people in danger and directs the doctor to them. That's why it doesn't always land where the doctor wants it to or says it has.

&gt;How come the Daleks always upgrade but keep an eggbeater and plunger for hands?

That's incredibly complex technology that cannot possibly be comprehended by 21st century humans. Remember, the plunger thingy can extract memories, info, even press buttons and solve codes. And the egg beater is a powerful laser that can kill the shit out of anything not-Dalek.

&gt;How come he says to never change the course of things, then does it and there's no consequences?

He is an infinitely complex being who has the time vortex inside his head. He perceives what changes will fuck shit up, and which changes will just save lives. That's why he can change shit, but if a human saves her father shit gets super fucked up.

&gt;And how come the TARDIS has millions of floor space for rooms, yet we've only seen a closet in the new series?

Part of the mystery of the show. Use of the other rooms is certainly implied, so I see no inherent problem or contradiction here.

“...under existing conditions, private capitalists inevitably control, directly or indirectly, the main sources of information (press, radio, education). It is thus extremely difficult, and indeed in most cases quite impossible, for the individual citizen to come to objective conclusions and to make intelligent use of his political rights.
“Production is carried on for profit, not for use. There is no provision that all those able and willing to work will always be in a position to find employment; an ‘army of unemployed’ almost always exists...
“This crippling of individuals I consider the worst evil of capitalism... An exaggerated competitive attitude is inculcated into the student, who is trained to worship acquisitive success...
“I am convinced there is only one [italics in original] way to eliminate these grave evils, namely through the establishment of a socialist economy, accompanied by an educational system which would be oriented toward social goals. In such an economy, the means of production are owned by society itself and are utilized in a planned fashion. A planned economy, which adjusts production to the needs of the community, would distribute the work to be done among all those able to work and would guarantee a livelihood to every man, woman and child. The education of the individual, in addition to promoting his own innate abilities, would attempt to develop in him a sense of responsibility for his fellow-men in place of the glorification of power and success in our present society.”

true,[deleted],null,null,"Some people on this thread have a fundamental misunderstanding of how tax works. Barclays is a multinational. It pays tax in multiple jurisdictions. If you pay tax in one jurisdiction it can be off set against tax due in another so you don't pay tax twice on the same money. This is called a double taxation treaty. It stops a business paying tax twice on the same money. Business investment can be off set against profits  as can losses. If I were a Barclays shareholder I would be very angry if they weren't doing everything they could to legally structure their affairs to minimize all business costs, which includes taxation. Barclays pays the absolute minimum in corporation tax it legally has to and I applaud it for that because it's a good business. It's important to understand the difference between tax avoidance, which is perfectly legal and an obligation, I would say, on all businesses, and evasion which is illegal.  Taxation levels in most countries border on out right theft (top rate of personal income tax in the UK is 50% and when reduction of allowances is taken into account this rises to around 65%.) This is simple avarice on behalf of government and since taxation rarely goes down it's likely to only get worse. People are leaving the UK in droves due to high tax. These people are high flyers and we need them here. Business are allowed tax breaks because business is the only thing that creates jobs and positive tax contribution and growth. See Friedman's and Gammon's law to see why this is the case. The daftest thing I hear, and I hear it often is: If there are no jobs why doesn't the government just create them? That's because, and it's something Labour never learned, is that government jobs do not create a positive net contribution to the tax base. In fact, the reverse is true.  I therefore congratulate Barclays because in the capitalist system, that being the only one that works, it's doing a fine job. The soft left Guardian reading liberal elite moan about the morality of tax avoidance but what's more moral, to have a thriving and growing business sector that creates jobs, increases profits and therefore pays more tax or a moribund one that plods along with all the enthusiasm of a Mexican donkey and pays less tax or no tax at all? Remember how efficient state industries were before they were privatized? As a general rule private industry does things far more cost effectively than the state AND makes a profit. Some people may not like it but it's the truth. The truth is that what ever the government does generally costs twice as much as the same thing in the private sector. 

And no, I would not have bailed out the banks because in doing so the government paid too much.

1. The research was done by the Tax Payer's Alliance, a group well known for providing papers such as the Daily Mail with right-wing half-truths. That doesn't automatically mean that what they report here is false, but it's something to keep in mind.

2. Consider reality. ""Geordies have nine bins"": you have to stop and think if this tallies with reality. 9 bins outside every house? Really? Of course not. Perhaps they're counting supermarket coloured-bottle bins as belonging to houses within an x-mile radius of the supermarket. Who knows. But it shows they're being loose with their statistics, and begs the question, what else is made up? I personally don't know anyone in the UK with more than 2 bins...

3. Based on the emotive language of the author (""For Greens who look upon humans as dirty and destructive"" or ""Recycling is a top-down-enforced form of self-flagellation"") it's clear that it is not his intention to provide a balanced view, but to push his anti-green opinion using the questionable statistics provided by the TPA.

You're only a few hundred thousand words away from *Atlas Shrugged*.

If you honestly think letting the banks fail would have been a good thing you're *really* delusional. Politicians weren't exaggerating when they say it would have caused a domino effect which would have knocked out pretty much every major bank. We *depend* on their infrastructure for our economy to function. Not just lending, but holding and maintaining our wealth, which is the very driving force of our economy. If you suddenly had no idea how much money you had how the hell do you run a business? If you didn't have a bank account which customers could deposit money how do you run a business? If the business which had been well-run for 20 years and had lots of assets saved up suddenly had the same as the business which had been shit and had nothing, what the fuck? It would have totally totally destroyed the international economy.

As to the ""high-flyers"", they're *really* not that special. I genuinely believe that. There are positions in the top of business which are highly paid, including board members on top companies. These people justify their own extravagant pay by claiming that these CEOs, Directors etc are worth the huge amount because they're *so* rare. Utter bollocks. Has a huge multinational *ever* found it impossible to find a CEO? They claim this nonsense so they can pay themselves the same absurd amount, and the biggest scam of the last 30 years is that Shareholders believed them. Its a recent thing by the way- 40/50 years ago CEOs didn't get paid 2000x the amount that a standard worker did, it came about in the 80s and its got worse and worse every year.

You're right that its the obligation of companies to avoid as much tax as correct- its good business. You entirely forget to mention, though, that its the obligation of Government to close the loopholes which enable businesses to pay such small amounts of tax, relatively to small business which can't afford to pay a legion of bullshit lawyers to justify this shit.

Why should my family business end up paying full corporation tax because we aren't a huge multinational and can't afford our own legal team to sort this out? Its absurd.

You think taxation levels border on outright theft? Then fucking leave, and I guarantee that you're not so special that there aren't several million other people in our country of sixty million that can't happily do your job whilst paying the same taxes and enjoying the same level of public services we enjoy.

The Ayn Randist bullshit that we depend on some kind of special elite to make our country work is the biggest crock of shit I've ever heard.

true,nonpareilpearl,tardis,TARDIS,"&gt;Half of Martha's season was spent with her agonizing over leaving her parents and doing dangerous things. Then she becomes some kind of alien bounty hunter with Mickey. And Mickey? WTF is that about? They're married now?

I've always thought of it like this (although there are other explanations): Mickey wanted Rose, Martha wanted the Doctor, and Rose and the Doctor wanted each other. So...Mickey and Martha were each other's second best?

&gt;Why does the Doctor drop Rose et all to the parallel world? He doesn't have to bring them back there, he could leave them on the normal universe and together, just not go back there. There was no reason to do that - fuck, he could have shown up and picked up Pete and gone back instead.

I think that part of that was other considerations besides the human Doctor. Remember that ""our"" Jackie met, married, and had a baby with ""their"" Pete. Obviously, Jackie wouldn't want to leave the baby and her husband so she'd stay in ""their"" universe. If Rose stayed in ""our"" universe instead of ""theirs"", then she'd never see her mother again. So, regardless of what happened with the human Doctor, the only way to really keep their family together was to put them ALL on one side of the parallel universe or another. Since Rose, Jackie, and Pete were all ""dead"" (really dead in the case of Pete) in ""our"" universe, then maybe he felt it made more sense to have them all in the other universe.

Also possible, but I'm not sure about this next bit: there is some speculation (I'm not sure if this is confirmed or not) that Bad Wolf Rose made the events happen the way they did (re: Donna-Doctor, Doctor-Donna). This, of course, ultimately meant that Donna lost her memories of traveling with the Doctor. It is possible that, if true, the Doctor caught onto this and between that and when Rose tried to save her father (back in S1) he considered it too dangerous for her to be in ""our"" universe. I don't really know.

Yes, the high flyers are that special. I have met many millionaires and two billionaires. They are very sharp indeed. 

I acknowledge the rant. I was hoping to provoke an interesting debate. It's called flame bate.

I enjoyed your come back. It was fun, but none the less delusional than my piece.

Is that enough paragraphs?

It is not necessarily the governments job to close as many loop holes as it can. Government does have a role in allowing entrepreneurs room to breath; eg investment incentives and tax breaks. That's why business gets them and employees don't. It's a de-facto recognition by the state that economic growth comes via business growth. Sadly in this country we no longer seem to recognize this and the push for tax harmonization Europe wide is an error. The US is no better. 

My Grandad was paying 98% tax under a former labour government. Where is the work incentive there?

There is also a negative correlation between taxation and charitable giving. The more tax people pay, the less they tithe. I think Cameron (whatever people's view of him) is on the right track with the big society idea. People used to have more community spirit than they now do, which is a shame. The state can't do everything and neither can charity. An equitable balance is required, which was completely lost under Labour. Labour never understands that the state can't do everything and neither should it try. I am not a minarchist, I just believe in personal sovereignty and dignity which must be better than any other solution?

I have seen first hand the moral sapping waste that living on benefit causes. I am long term severely disabled. Perhaps if you had as much experience dealing with government inefficiency as I have you might change your view of how efficient the state is. It really really isn't. Trust me, I am in a position to know. It took nearly two years and a disabled facilities grant of £5k to get the door to my home widened for my wheelchair. The job was to put a door in a false wall. It took two visits from a social worker, two from an Occupational Therapist and two years of bureaucracy. This was with an efficient council. I know a master carpenter. He said the real cost to do the job was £500, which I would have had done the next week. Two years, four visits and a £5k cost. Is this good value? The same scenario is played out daily across the country. And what about the famed NHS double or triple queuing system. Que to see the GP, que to see the consultant, que to get referred for an operation, que for the operation. Is this efficient? The NHS saved my life, twice, but it is NOT efficient. If you go private you can have the consultation one day and the op the next. The NHS is great but it is run terribly.

I have read Ayn Rand. Interesting but kind of dull and simplistic. She's also wind bag. Remind you of anyone? lol.

""as a rule the private sector is better""
This has become pretty much a dogmatic belief of society now with very little evidence to support it.

How about the U.S.S.R? How about the GDR? How about Cuba? How about any former Warsaw Pact Country, whatsoever? How about Zimbabwe? How about North Korea? How about the former U.S.S.R?

None of these had a thriving economy did they, when they had no private sector to speak of?

Compare these countries to ones that do have a thriving private sector. Germany (growth sapped by having to rebuild the GDR) UK, Singapore, USA, UK, Hong Kong, etc.

What turned round the old eastern European countries? The private sector and private sector investment capital. Q.E.D.

The cold war wasn't won with weapons, it was won with money. The capitalist system won it for us, we won it with money. The Marxist ideal is dead. DEAD. There is not a single credible arguement in favour of marxism or socialism left.

Commercial Banks borrow money from the Central Bank (Reserve Bank) at extremely low rates.   In the UK the  cost of borrowing is 0.5%.     Imagine if you could borrow at 0.5% and then just put it into a savings account that pays you 1%.  You have made very easy money.  


The government has followed a monetary policy of that uses our money (taxpayers) and at our expense to allow the banks to make easy money.      Banks are benefiting, but we (majority) are not.  We are getting poorer as our money becomes more worthless and as inflation increases.  And we as savers are getting paid very little interest on our savings.


 So in effect we as UK taxpayers are subsidising the banking sector even further with monetary policy.

In fact, Remembrance also had Davros as the Dalek Emperor but he was just a head in a machine but when they brought him back for the updated series, he was back to Genesis of the Dalek Nehru jacket and space wheelchair Davros.  They have never given a canonized reason why there is a Skaro or why Davros has a body again.

But the biggest thing that I can't get over is that the Doctor is about 908 years old (despite being in his 950's during the McCoy years but it's easy to write off things said by 7th Doctor as a lie) yet he has used 10 of his 12 regenerations in under 50 years.
