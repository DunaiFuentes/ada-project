Not to nitpick, but you can't use Paveway and Brimstone in an aerial battle. Comparing the aerial performance of GR9s to Eurofighters is unwise as one is a dedicated ground attack aircraft. Sea Harriers would be a better comparison (and the Eurofighter would win every single time), but we scrapped them years ago anyway. The decisive weapon in such engagements would be likely to be the AMRAAM, not ASRAAM.

If another battle of the Falklands ever occurs, the Typhoons would be able to intercept and destroy any of the aircraft the Argentinians sent their way before they ever saw the islands. A single sub could take care of any invasion fleet (assuming it is in the right place) they could sail against the islands, and the islands could be rapidly reinforced with troops by air.

true,mmaaikeu,null,null,"&gt; Going to the gym is just strengthening the rentier class. It would be another endeavour **receiving socially guaranteed privatised profits**.

I think that is closer to what I meant.

&gt; Then you don't understand the purpose of a gym.

For professional sportsman or when recovering from injury it has a very specific utility, but for 'the masses' the modern gym is a far cry from the traditional gymnasium, filled with machines designed for rapid turnover of clients and income, that arguably do as much to undermine a person's strength as enhance it, leaving a false sense of achievement in the process. It is an outsourcing of fitness rather than an incorporation into day-to-day activity.

I'll let Mark Rippletoe (*Starting Strength* 2^nd Edition) speak for me:

&gt; The primary reason for this was that Nautilus equipment allowed the health club (at the time known as the ""health spa"") industry to offer to the general public a thing which had been previously unavailable. Prior to the invention of Nautilus, if a member wanted to train hard, in a more elaborate way than Universal equipment permitted, he had to learn how to use barbells. Someone had to teach him this. Moreover, someone had to teach the heath spa staff how to teach him this. Such professional education was, and still is, time consuming and not widely available.

&gt; But with Nautilus equipment, a minimum-wage employee could be taught very quickly how to use the whole circuit, ostensibly providing a total-body workout with little invested in employee education. Furthermore, the entire circuit could be performed in about 30 minutes, thus decreasing member time on the exercise floor, increasing traffic capacity in the club, and maximizing sales exposure to more traffic. Nautilus equipment quite literally made the existence of the modern health club possible.

People going to the gym and cheaper gyms are not going to improve the overall health of the nation. My main point is the promotion of exercise in itself, especially things like ubiquitous gym membership, fails for the majority. The real solution entails involving exertion into endeavours that create value besides a healthy body: cycling, walking, gardening, building, less sedentary employment, less TV.",0,1324566925,null,0,false,0,c3a9vdf,t3_nm55u,t1_c3a9vdf,t1_c3a9ivi,1428060198,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt; I'm surprised to hear how much consideration is being given to wood as an energy supply.

Yes, lack of public knowledge has been a big obstacle in NI to the more widespread use of this fuel. There just isn't much of a history of using wood as a fuel source in this country. Something like peat is a more traditional fuel supply, and today its mostly oil and gas. 98% of the energy supply in NI comes from non-renewable sources, although there has been significant investment in wind-energy. In other more heavily forested countries, such as Austria there isn't this same lack of public knowledge of the heat and energy potential of wood because it has a longer history of being used.

In Austria and Scandinavia in particular biomass technology is very well developed. It's used in large scale industrial CHP (combined heat and power) plants. It can also be used by individual factories and large buildings in the form of wood pellets, by whole housing developments through district heating and in individual homes in the form of wood chip which is burned in a biomass boiler or in the form of logs which are burned in a wood stove (this is the low-technology option which is relatively common among rural middle-class families but isn't used as the primary source of fuel). 

The problem is, as you mention, most houses in NI don't have biomass biolers. Although the initial investment of setting up a boiler is quite expensive (in the region of £5,000-£10,000) it's a good long-term investment as wood chip fuel is much less expensive than oil is these days. The government is currently discussing a Renewable Heat Incentive, which would involve grants for people considering installing biomass boilers which would really help give the industry a kickstart.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt;I think that is closer to what I meant.

What's the problem if it is something that benefits all people, and also provides employment in the process? Everyone should use the gym and other fitness services, so I see no problem in funding it from general taxation. It's similar to education.

&gt;For professional sportsman or when recovering from injury it has a very specific utility, but for 'the masses' the modern gym is a far cry from the traditional gymnasium, filled with machines designed for rapid turnover of clients and income, that arguably do as much to undermine a person's strength as enhance it, leaving a false sense of achievement in the process. It is an outsourcing of fitness rather than an incorporation into day-to-day activity.


Not really, it still provides a good environment, and really depends on the gym itself. I don't see any problem with weight machines, as they can provide a controlled and safe alternative to, say, weighted squats which can be hard for those with back difficulties. Good gyms have both machines and weights anyway. You are complaining about a small aspect of some gyms, not the principle of the gym itself.

&gt; The real solution entails involving exertion into endeavours that create value besides a healthy body: cycling, walking, gardening, building, less sedentary employment, less TV.

The gym is simply more efficient, and can be used to help enhance other such activities. For example, I go to the gym and go rock climbing when possible. I agree that other changes are necessary too, but then we get to real fundamental issues with society, like keeping people employed in needless makework that could be automated just because it's seen to be the way things should be.

But what would be your best strategy? I think having gyms in schools would help a lot (as they did in my rebuilt school), and especially emphasising bodyweight exercises as it is equal for all people.

true,kouei,lfcflame,,"Remember more than 12 months ago under Woy when we were struggling to even get a draw at away games? When our home record was a laughing stock? When we were still complaining about Konchesky and Poulsen making the teamsheet and that silly decision to send Aquilani on loan? When we had a half-hearted Torres sulking like a baby on the field? When we had Agger, arguably our best centre-back, benched? Don't forget the atrocious interviews from Woy which made Liverpool look like a bloody joke.. 

When Kenny came in he undoubtedly lifted the team spirit and got us playing proper football once again. The FAMOUS Liverpool drawing games against ""small clubs"" like Wigan and Swansea? Yes, sure we're frustrating to watch at times, but do we seriously want to sack a manager just because he managed DRAWS against mid/bottom-table teams? By that argument, Barca fans should have been be calling for Guardiola's head after that lost against Getafe since they're the ""best team in the world"".

Some of Kenny's decisions have surely been questionable, specifically as a few have mentioned, doing too little too late when we're trying to win. But you cannot deny that under him we now have a solid defense (finally getting to see Agger and Skrtel as an established CB pairing and not having Cara simply walk back into the team) and actually playing proper football and not hoofball. Most importantly, the togetherness of the team we have now is just pleasing to watch. 

Not as tactically sophisticated as the top bosses? Could you further elaborate? You say we can beat the big teams yet he is not as tactically sophisticated as the top bosses? Mind you it is not ""always the case"" that we are adept at beating ""big teams"" over the last 15 years. Look no further than Rafa's first few seasons at Liverpool.. In 04-05 and 05-06 when playing the traditional ""top four"" sides in league games, we've only managed wins against Arsenal.. 


I think I may have said too much now and I mean no disrespect, but I do believe that Kenny deserves a full season before we start judging whether or not he's the right man. The same can be said for those ""underperforming players"" you've mentioned. While criticism may help them realize they need to up their standards on the pitch, they are Liverpool players and should have the full backing of the fans.

Employment for employment's sake is just as dubious as exercise for sake of exercise. If you want to encourage fitness for the masses then it needs to come attached to something else of value as there is only a minority who can dedicate themselves to thrice weekly visits.

&gt; ...simply more efficient...

That surely is debatable considering time totally dedicated to exertion that could involve a dual purpose, time travelling, and running costs. Overall I am objecting to the idea that access to fitness needs to be bought or subsidised. Perhaps more importantly judging by the many who start the new year off with gym memberships to then fail by February, inefficacy as a general means of raising fitness seems obvious. Indeed the definition of the gym is a slippery beast.

Best strategy... hmm... local currencies that can support local food producers who can then undercut the entrenched food monopolies, whilst proving *meaningful* employment and value creation.

Tactics: 4-4-2 away to Spurs with Henderson on the right where he is clearly uncomfortable - he is getting better but at the time he clearly had no positional sense and constantly drifted inside. This left Spurs 2 v 1 on Skrtel who is not a natural right back. Add to that the fact that one of those 2 was Bale who is arguably one of their most dangerous players. Then the fact that he played a 2 man midfield in that game, where away from home I would tend to favour packing that area to gain more possession. If we wanted to concede possession and play counter-attacking then why did we have Carroll up front? I've picked that one game where we were utterly outplayed to highlight my point, but there have been other similar instances, either we were playing teams that were too weak to punish us, or we got lucky.

It is also frustrating to see Man Utd spend less money on better players and have them bed in so quickly (in the case of Jones) and Downing, Carroll and Henderson (to a lesser extent) continue to labour.

Jesus was a Jewish philosopher  
Had a lot of nice ideas  
About our existential fears  
Much admired by his peers  
  
  
Short and Jewish and quite political  
Often hesitant and very analytical  

  
Praise be to Jesus  
Praise be to woody Allen Jesus  
Woody Allen Jesus  
  
  
Jesus was a great entertainer  
Doing cool tricks all of the time  
Turning water in to wine  
Making stormy weather fine  
Even now his stunts confound us  
Kinda did what Derren Brown does  
  
  
Praise be to Jesus  
Praise be to magic woody Allen Jesus  
Magic woody Allen Jesus  
  
  
Jesus died but then came back to life  
So the holy bible said  
Kinda like in dawn of the dead  
Like a film by Simon Pegg  
Try that these days you’d be in trouble  
Geeks would try to smack you with a shovel  
  
  
Praise be to Jesus  
Praise be to magic woody Allen zombie Jesus  
Magic woody Allen zombie Jesus  
  
  
Jesus ascended in to heaven  
He was an incredible guy  
You don’t often find fellas that fly  
Disappear right in to the sky  
And only once did he use this ability  
With great power comes great responsibility  
  
  
Praise be to Jesus  
Praise be to magic woody Allen zombie superman Jesus  
Jesus  

  
Jesus’ mother gave birth to him  
Without having sex with a dude  
She would never be that rude  
Never even be nude with a dude  
Breeding without the opposite gender is  
Commonly known as parthenogenesis  
Other animals that don’t need males  
Include a lot of lizards  
And various snails  
  
  
Praise be to Jesus  
Praise be to magic woody Allen zombie superman Komodo dragon Jesus  
Jesus  

  
Jesus can communicate with the deceased  
Like psychic sally  
Jesus lives forever  
Which is pretty odd  
But not as odd as his fetish for drinking blood  
Jesus is in more than one place at a time  
Like an electron or Schrödinger’s feline  
Jesus pulled off that water walking miracle  
He was as handy as an amphibious vehicle  
Jesus had bare feet, long hair and a beard  
Look, I’m not saying it’s me.  
  
  
I’m not saying that I am Jesus  
I’m not saying that I am Jesus  
I am Jesus  
Praise be to Jesus  
Praise be to woody Allen Jesus  
Woody Allen Jesus  
  
  
Praise be to magic woody Allen zombie superman Komodo dragon telepathic  
Vampire quantum hovercraft me  
Jesus

This one's kind of a coin toss, and really depends on the context.  Imagine the following situation: Jimmy is black and has allegedly murdered fifteen people in Texas, with malice aforethought.  No doubt he's going to fry, right?  All the while, his pretty young Public Defender facing obstacles both legal and societal, struggles to overturn Jimmy's conviction.  The actual killer, as it happens, was the son of a cattle rancher whom Jimmy'd stripped of a football to make the winning play at the cattle rancher's son's homecoming game.  The pretty young Public Defender, after years of searching, finally discovers the blood-stained sand wedge the cattle rancher's son used in the murders, covered up and down with his incriminating fingerprints.  The PYPD races to the aid of Jimmy, with whom she's fallen in love and doesn't care who knows, and receives a stay of execution for her wrongly-accused beloved.  But irony of ironies: the pretty young Public Defender forgot to set her clock forward for daylight savings time, and Jimmy's already been dead for two minutes while she's breathing a sigh of relief in the Governor's office as the Governor, bewildered, makes the phone call only to discover to everyone's dismay that Jimmy's already toast and now he has to break the news to the pretty young Public Defender, who isn't going to take this little zigzag of kismet well, one suspects.

&gt; EDIT: Also, sorry to nitpick back, but I'm pretty confident nobody really knows whether mid-range such as AMRAAM or short-range such as ASRAAM would do more in air-to-air combat since there are 2 schools of thought on such battles. One says long-range interception with something like AMRAAM or METEOR would be better; others think no matter what range weaponry you have it could end up in an up-close scrap where smaller weapons like Sidewinder or ASRAAM would serve better. Which is why the RAF buys both kinds.

Very true - however it's my opinion that the AMRAAMs would be used at stand-off ranges before the Argentinians came near the island, and would serve to blunt any attack before it arrived. Any that get through would of course be attacked with the shorter range weapons, but I think the ability to out-range the Argentinian weapons would be decisive in an aerial engagement.",0,1324575273,null,0,false,0,c3ab5en,t3_nl1zn,t1_c3ab5en,t1_c3aatek,1428060797,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

&gt;Hi ITV,

&gt;I'm really disappointed that you edited Tim Minchin's song from tomorrow night's Jonathan Ross show.

&gt;I also feel that there really was no need to do this. This really was quite a tame song with no real malice towards Christianity. It was simply comedy.

&gt;Many people (even his fans) may not agree with his views on religion, but still find him funny and sometimes thought provoking.

&gt;I also think there's room in the schedules in December for some material that gives us some light relief from all the traditional Christmas fare that is in added into most channels' programming.

&gt;Many people found Tim on Jonathan Ross' show, and I think they will be disappointed not to get a song when he is due on the show.

&gt;I certainly am.

It's ok to put a Scientologist on the Christmas show?

EDIT: here's their reply:

&gt;Dear Sir/Madam

&gt;Thank you for your recent email regarding The Jonathan Ross Show.

&gt;I can confirm that your comments have been noted here at ITV Viewer
Services.

&gt;We often make changes to programmes before transmission and on this
occasion we felt that the song didn't quite work editorially

&gt;May I take this opportunity to thank you for taking the time to contact
us here at ITV Viewer Services.

&gt;If we can be of further assistance please do not hesitate to contact us.

Yes, because right now, millions of people are classed as criminals because they consume a plant.

Yes, because cannabis is not physically addictive.

Yes, because if other people can get their rocks off getting drunk any day, why can't I sit in my living room and smoke a joint?!

Most importantly YES, because people are going to smoke weed regardless of the law.

So the money is potentially going into the hands of hardened criminals (not just bob who sells a bit of his own grow) and those same hardened criminals have no issue spraying the weed with things like silicon to add weight / make it look frosty.

We are heading offtrack a little. There is no point juicing society with meaningless employment *especially* amidst a 'crisis'. When you rebuild solid foundations seem important.

In general I object to the focus on employment and the absurd situation where there are 'no jobs'. I see little dialogue exploring why individuals cannot create their own value for themselves and their communities, especially when the answer is obvious; a surpression by a rentier class. Shit we don't need is ubiquitous yet: 

* 'We' have no land nor easy access to primary resources,
* there is not even open access to clean water or fuel,
* the housing industry affords no space for value creation but serves up pokey homes in pokey estates, when we could have near zero cost onsite water catchment and reed-bed effluent processing (just for example),
* town-planning and the car have isolated the home from areas of value creation and leaves no communal space to be used creatively.

It's probably illegal in most cases to use residential land for maximising agriculture, and patents, copyright and much other legislation stifle employment by favouring the incumbent.

I think my main contention is that mass gyms, even sports centres, and especially the silly suggestion of 'fat taxes', address a symptom of some deeper trauma. It's like a bandaid over a cut when what's really needed is to take away the knife. A zero-cost approach to exercise is really needed especially for children, and 'the gym' shouldn't be the first thought when considering the health of the nation. You probably shouldn't get me started on organised sports, but I'll say one thing: for a nation where football is ubiquitous and there are pitches in every school, we sure foster many an obese child. For me the answer has to lie elsewhere. (It is interesting though when taken globally, organised sport correlates well with obesity, and for that reason I cannot see more sport being the solution.)",0,1324577009,null,0,false,0,c3abgd1,t3_nm55u,t1_c3abgd1,t1_c3aauay,1428060941,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

But we are. The article is about how plastic/rubber bullets should never be an option, which I think would be more ideal than live ammunition in cases where lives are at serious risk.

During the riots, 'people' were setting fire to houses and shops indiscriminately. Should they not be willing to let anyone help, then police need to use force to get to see if innocent people aren't burning to death. Rubber bullets are quick and easy. They might not be attempting murder, but you don't know if there are people in those buildings.

But as you quite rightly say...

&gt;The problem is as with all heavy handed tactics this will be misused

And this is where we fall down. Ideally the police would be able to carry guns because they would only ever use them in extreme cases that warranted them. But we know this will never be the case, and as such we need to place heavy restrictions on weaponry. 

But where do we draw the line between the risk to innocent people and the risk of criminals and collateral damage?

You could also try to go for a public sector job, maybe the Civil Service or a local Council. They recruit annually due to people leaving/retiring and as they perform essential operations, they have no choice but to re-hire.

Call centres seem to be hiring too, a couple of friends have wound up at Gem and they seem to be really keen if you are bi/multi-lingual.

The only companies that seem to be ""thriving"" in NI atm are software or technology based companies, so it may even be worth trying to apply for a non-technical/admin/hr role in some of the more successful companies. You could try the following (off the top of my head who have been in the news recently):

* Andor
* Asidua
* Cybersource
* Kainos
* Liberty
* First Derivatives
* Singularity

btw the grass is no greener in the rest of the UK/Ireland. It doesn't hurt to apply for jobs across the water to see if you are offered the interview but an entire relocation will most likely only exacerbate financial problems as the situation is just as bad. 

I have heard some horror stories of grads assuming there is plenty of work in England so they throw themselves in the deep end by moving and looking for work. The market is saturated UK-wide with graduates :( 

Hope this proves useful and all the best.

No last-minute revelations rushed in too late to have any impact, and no ""we made you think that was going to be important but it really isn't.""  At the end, the voice and the Silents are dealt with, River Song gets her last appearances before heading off to the Library, and the Doctor gets to start afresh to have new adventures.

(I'd have the Voice -- the ultimate adversary -- revealed in episode ten as the Time Lord Omega.  But I'd want his history snuck in to the earlier episodes somehow, concealed, so that it has some impact for new viewers who don't know classic Who.  ""Surprise!  The baddie is some guy from the old show you never heard of before!  Just look him up online!"" would seem like a cheat.  And I've got an idea for Amy and the Silents, too…)

On the other hand, if I were *Steven Moffat* I'm afraid I would build people's hopes up by promising too much, get everyone excited…and then reveal I was making it all up as I went along, and all those clues I was planting didn't lead anywhere, and lots of questions would go unanswered.   :-(

No it's not a joke, last century we were absolutely sure that the first world war would be a walk over for our supperiour horses - then we got entrenched in a form of warfare which made horses obsolete, we were ready for ww2 and france was impregnable thanks to the [maginot line](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSSBQWbF7R8) but no one had bothered to read the widely available 'Blitzkrieg' which talked in detail of the tactics which would give the germans a huge headstart.  America was technically and socially streets ahead of vietnam and of course they could deal with a tinpot rebel force! Tunnels and hit-and-fade resulted in huge losses leading up to the final american defeat.  The middle east however would be a different story because we'd learnt lessons and now had long range missiles all worked out....  on the second attempt the west managed to have Saddam ousted and hung but only after bankrupting ourselves in the process, a string of wars which we apparently 'won' but in reality ended with 'the enemy' in a stronger position than before and us poorer and less able to influence the region.  These are only the huge examples; Pride goes before destruction, a haughty spirit before a fall. 
  
Nations that use our methods of warfare with our budgets *are* very powerful, however they're certainly not invulnerable and history had bore this out time and time again.  
  
All i'm saying is that it's possible the first encounter of the war might swing hard against us, our defensive capabilities are impressive but we don't have the shield from startrek - some cunning or luck could favour the Argentinian navy, catch us looking the other way and all of a sudden our already depleted and outdated navy is seriously affected.  New plans would need to be made for procurement, maybe the jets for those floating runways would have to be pushed back a bit, or we'd re-jiggle the decommissioning process to repatch a few already patched-patches and keep some tea strainers afloat another decade...  
  
A lot of our potential enemies would gain from this, we're constantly being dicks towards China - maybe if they could slip a few dollars into the right palm or drop off a few crates of whatever in the right dock the geopolitical game would drastically change for them.  We sailed up and down their coast firing cannons into the houses because we were angry they didn't want us selling opium - don't think they have a single shread of respect for the Royal Navy.  Even if it's unlikely Argentine have a chance against us alone we simply can't guess how 'alone' they'd be in this, thats the nature of the modern world.

Some enterprising individuals who have sites in pubs and clubs will get the stuff off the arcades who just throw them out which puts a few quid in the arcade owner or managers back pocket and saves them the trouble of hiring a skip. They'll then put these machines in pubs etc on shares with the pub and club owners. Those are most likely to be the ones you spend the majority of your time on.

For example, I'd go into an arcade with £10. Thats my bet money. I play that until its gone. Any winnings go into my pocket and don't get touched. After the £10 has gone, I walk out with whatever I've put in my pocket. I don't spend what I've won ""just in case I might win more"". If things have been good I walk out with more than I went in with. If they aren't I've minimised my losses. Either way I walk out of the place with something. 

99.9% of people who play fruit machines play their bet money and then play what they've won ""because it'll go onto a win streak"" or in some stupid attempt to win back their inital £10 or whatever until they've run out of money altogether. They typically leave with empty pockets every time.

However I only play for fun, not to win. When you've worked in the industry both for a manufacturer and as an engineer in an arcade you know just how much the odds are stacked against the punter walking out with any of their money, let alone what they came in with.

When I was about 13/14 I was calling my mum from a payphone (ah, the days before mobiles) after school and a kid from the year above me opened the door and asked what I was doing.

""Erm... making a call?""    
""Well, if I find you've been lying to me I'll slash your head open. Right?"" He says, flashing a small knife.

My family contacted the local police as soon as I got home and it turned out this kid and another had been threatening people all the way home from school, including taking a small amount of money (he didn't have much) off a friend's brother.

The local bobby was very eager to get the CPS to prosecute, as much as they could, in a bid to get this kid on the straight and narrow: Scare him young enough to keep him away from living a similar life to much of the rest of his family - a bunch of wrong 'uns would be a fair way to describe them.

This young policeman visited my parents and explained what he was trying to do and made it clear he thought that this would go to court and hopefully end up with this lad getting the shit scared out of him and sort his life out.

A few months later my parents had heard nothing so phoned him. He was surprised they hadn't heard from the CPS (or similar) and investigated. It turns out that the powers that be decided not to prosecute or do *anything* with this kid and didn't even bother telling the families/victims that they were dropping the case.

A 14/15 year old threatens several people with a knife and commits armed robbery... And fuck all occurs. Awesome.

First of al, its only fair to mention that 4-4-2 is only a viable option due to injuries and suspensions in midfield. Even then, 4-2-3-1 is possible if Henderson and Adam can stay disciplined.

Our finishing has been poor and we've had terrible luck in some places. 

But remember this: Lucas is out, Spearing is suspended, Gerrard is out, against spurs (our only BAD loss) johnson and kelly were out (thus skrtel at RB, probably because Carra said he didn't want to get skinned by Bale). 

Truth is, we're still learning how to play with his system. If you sack him before they learn it you'll be mistaken. We are blowing hot and cold right now but when you consider all of the injuries/suspensions/off field issues, things could be FAR worse. The administration of the club (Kenny, JH, etc.) have handled everything absolutely brilliantly.

If you're gonna criticize the man, so be it. But don't seriously write him off for a couple of years. If, after 2-3 years of continued investment we're still losing/drawing Wigan and other teams, then maybe its time to get Kenny out of here. 

But even the mancs have bad days. Even Barcelona loses. The sign of a truly good team is a win when a draw or a loss was the most likely/deserved outcome. The game against Wigan (and to be fair Swansea and Norwich) was one of those days, a bad day at the office. And sometimes, a 1-0 win happens. Sometimes, a 0-0 draw. We can't win them all. This isn't American Football, the seasons are long and tiring and sometimes the team doesn't gel. 

The sooner this fanbase realizes this and quits the knee-jerk reactions, the better. There IS a fine line in which an underperforming manager can be sacked (see: Steve Keen), but we're far from it.

Bearing in mind that 50% of Britons have ""no religion"", the politicians' continued declarations that, as Cameron has recently implied, religion is the ""moral giver"" and that we all know, understand and need it makes absolutely no sense particularly when it comes to vote winning.

*Who* are they talking to? Admittedly the church still has some (too much) sway in the Lords and various other offices, as it seems that politicians in the house are far more religious than the general populace (particularly in the cabinet?), but really they're not doing themselves any favours surely?

At what point will a PM acknowledge that there are far more Muslims in the country than CoE affiliates, that the vast majority of the population are non-believers and that most people don't want, need or care about religion? 75% no-religion? 80%?

i think the next companion should be a guy. we've had mainly girls( 'cept Rory. we love Rory)  and it would be nice to have just a guy for once. a 20 year old ginger guy to be exact.

I would absolutely love to see a multi-doctor episode. with eleven and ten, and maybe one of ten's companions. I'm a big Rose fan, and i think if Rose came back, we'd finally get some closure on the doctors feelings. he'll see her and be able to move on. so will all the other Rose fans. plus a Rose/River cat fight would be kind of awesome. like the Sarah Jane thing except better. although, thinking about it, it might not be a good idea to bring Rose back. maybe if she was back with Handy.

this is kind of random, but i think the Doc should be put into a situation with a young teenage girl. being a young teenage girl myself, i know how we act, and i know the Doc would be completely thrown of his guard by some 14 year old sassy, obnoxious teenage girl. 

I'd also like to see the salem witch trials. with a monty python reference. 

But thats just me.

Since Steven Moffat took over he pretty much rebooted the series.   It seemed like everything from Hartnell to Tennant suddenly never happened.  Russel Davies, in my opinion, seemed to have more respect for the previous continuity as well as the writers that came before him.  This is all well illustrated in Smiths first season.

&gt; What is your religion?
  
Answers:    
61% have religion: ~53% Christian.    
39% No religion.

Of the ""Have religion"":

&gt; Are you religious?

29% Yes.    
65% **NO**.

So. 39% No religion + 65% of 61% not religious = 39% + 40% = 79% of people have no religion and/or are not practicing (i.e. 'cultural' religious).

That survey would imply that 4/5 people do not use/need/want/care actively about religion.

Shitty Census question is like asking: What is your favourite football team?     
Excuse me but my answer to that leading question is, and always has been, ""I don't have one - I don't like football."" It seems that many people would reply ""Well... I was born in X so I suppose X Rovers is my football team.""

They dislike and fear secularism because it removes any and all religion from having any particular weight. As religious adherence diminishes, no one religion really holds sway in terms of numbers. The CoE has ~1 million active members (attending weekly/monthly services). There are far more active Muslims in the country.

As such any particular issue where it seems the CoE will lose out, something like the MCoB is going to be behind them because the CoE reflects their wishes far more than secularists do.

This exposure is also what causes the Gallifreyans to evolve into Time Lords as said in the episode previous. This means that biologically, Jenny should be able to just regenerate like the Doctor, as her genetic code should already have the Time Lord genetic exposure, while River gets a short cut of Time Lord genetics via in utero exposure.

true,strolls,null,null,"I absolutely detest Thatcher, my main gripe being that she sold off a *huge* national resource for short-term political gain. At one time a *third* of the population lived in a council house, and I believe that her actions had a huge impact on today's poor and social deterioration.

I wrote a long post, which I cannot now find, about this a few months ago, but in the late 70s the ""scrounging doley scum"" lived in council homes alongside those with jobs - factory workers, nurses and office clerks - and so had role models who could demonstrate the fruits (a new car, a new TV) of employment. The more upright citizens on a council estate would keep an eye on the activities of the lawless - cops would know who the local wrong 'uns were, and had the support of the community in dealing with them. Even if you were born with fuck all else - absent parents, a shitty education and no real hopes or expectations - at least you could put your name on the waiting list and aspire to a council house.

Now our dwindling council estates have turned into ghettos, in which feral yobs outnumber those upon who they would prey - the disabled, elderly and vulnerable - and the working poor are unable to afford their own homes and suffer the insecurity of private landlords and 6 month tenancies.

I suppose one cannot have expected Thatcher to foresee all the consequences of her actions, but fundamentally she did not have the right to sell off council houses as she did. They were a public asset, built up over decades, and the government held them in trust for the people. She sacrificed that asset to short-termism and her own political view.

I'm pretty sure that if I studied Thatcher's reign in detail I could find some civil liberties legislation that I object to, too, but I don't need to. For me, the council houses are enough. We should absolutely not be celebrating her.

I have recently exposed myself a little to feminism, and I do feel a bit bad that I'm arguing against a state funeral for our first woman prime-minister, but if she gets one (and I think she will) it will be for all the wrong reasons. She rose to power in the mid- to late 70s, and I think she probably did act a role model for female empowerment in the workplace. But she'll be remembered for her ""strength"" - not coming to comprise with her opposition, and finding ground on which everyone can agree, but for crushing them - and for heralding an era of consumerism. In many ways the scandal of the council houses is symbolic of that - free property wealth for hundreds of thousands of people, to the cost and detriment of their children and their children's generation.

Annoying on a small payment but for anything over 50 quid, you're laughing. Credit Cards are a minimum of about 1.7%, unless you've got a really good deal. I took an 800 payment the other day and it cost nearly £15. Credit card payments probably cost me about £100 a month. It's a bitter pill to swallow. I looked into passing this surcharge onto customers and it is illegal. However, I look around and for some reason loads of big companies seem to be allowed to do it. Ryanair, Snowdome, EasyJet etc. Another case of regulation hurting small businesses, whilst big business can run amok.

As for Rodwell, he's a plus in my book because of his home-grown status. With Ash, JT &amp; Lamps looking to hang up their boots in the next few years, we need to fill in those home-grown slots. Sure, we have Bertrand and Van Aanholt (and potentially Sam Hutchinson, too) waiting in the wings but the more the merrier, eh? Wouldn't hurt to have local lads in early, I'm guessing...

Mata is a brilliant piece of business but he can have his off days. Two playmakers who can sync up creatively from the midfield and unleash the wingers would be a wet dream. If not, they can at least be used in rotation, maybe?

To all intents and purposes, we are. Religion has very little hold over our lives.

&gt; And I think you're overlooking the constant encouragement religious groups are getting, not least with regards to being afforded every opportunity to set up more and more faith schools. 

I'm not saying there aren't issues to confront, I'm just used to the overblown reaction these things tend to get from the anti-religious crowd (as opposed to the non-religious). Faith schools aren't necessarily bad things in themselves, it's when the religious ethos starts compromising rather than complementing the education that I get worried. It's something to keep an eye on, but it's not the dawn of an oppressive theocracy.

&gt; Also last time I checked, there are still 26 Bishops sitting in the House of Lords for the sole reason that they believe in a god and were next in line.

Well, I think the real reason is not their belief but the rather outmoded nature of our second chamber and a hangover from our past traditions. Lords reform is coming and the direction is manifestly towards secularism and reform.

&gt; I'm sure you know that the only other nation in the world that affords such positions to clergy as a matter of course is Iran.

Are you *actually* comparing the UK to Iran? I think that's exactly the sort of over-reaction that undermines the real point, which is that clearly there's no good reason for the church to still have all these legislative positions by default.

true,Rugose,eng-devon,Devon,"Leah Betts. She followed guidance at the time to drink loads of water. MDMA produced an adverse effect whereby she retained water more than normal. I concede MDMA by itself crushing brain is incorrect.
However it is total bollocks (to use your phrase) that using Ecstasy is risk free.  (i'm well aware few things are risk free). Water + ecstasy can kill - fact. The risk is low but significant. 

Below is the wikipedia entry on Leah Betts. ""A subsequent inquest determined that her death was actually not directly due to ecstasy consumption, but rather the result of the large quantity of water she had consumed[9], apparently in observation of an advisory warning commonly given to ravers to drink water to avoid dehydration resulting from the exertion of dancing continuously for hours. Leah had been at home with friends and had not been dancing, yet consumed about 7 litres (12 pints) of water in less than 90 minutes, resulting in water intoxication and hyponatremia (low sodium levels; in this case due to the dilution of blood), which in turn led to serious swelling of the brain (cerebral oedema), irreparably damaging it. However, SIADH caused by the ecstasy, reducing her ability to urinate, may have exacerbated her hyponatremia. At the inquest it was stated by toxicologist Professor John Henry, who had previously warned the public of the danger of ecstasy causing death by dehydration,[10] ""If Leah had taken the drug alone she might well have survived. If she had drunk the amount of water alone she would have survived.""[11]",0,1324643883,null,0,false,0,c3aju9o,t3_nml2e,t1_c3aju9o,t1_c3ajfxh,1428064964,-1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,-1

* With a 95key you put it in test mode and you can see all the info you need anyway. Even if you win and the hopper runs out mid payout it's not an issue. You can get a floor attendant and they can see from the test mode last payout and how much of it was paid out.

* A lot of the locals who kept playing and playing and playing stated they did this for the older games but found it's not that applicable these days.

* The old Bar Crest fruit? Sounds like someone didn't set it up properly and left it in game test mode. In that mode it plays normally, uses coins, but you can use test codes to check the features and see if they're working properly.

* Not from what I know of. You get casuals, keyers and chavs who think they know, and then you get the sly fuckers who just turn up and watch people for an hour or so. Pick a game, win, then leave.

Well done you. Anything to contribute... No? Read the [reddiquette](http://www.reddit.com/help/reddiquette), you moron.
____________

&gt; Religion has very little hold over our lives.

It has some. That's too much.     
Which of these is 'OK' and why?

* Collective worship in schools: It is the *law* that schools must lead children in collective worship (of primarily a Christian nature) everyday. It doesn't matter that most schools ignore it - [people tried to get the law changed 
recently and it was batted down.](http://www.secularism.org.uk/challenge-collective-worship-law.html)    

* Many parents seem not to realise that they can opt their children out (law change in only 2006) and for [those that do it can be a very difficult affair.](http://poddelusion.co.uk/blog/2011/09/21/secularism-2011-part-2/) (Dr Antony Lempert speech - scroll down slightly).

* [Cameron etc. recently announced a plan to send a KJV bible to every school](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-16231223) in the country.     

* [26 un-elected men in the Lords](http://www.secularism.org.uk/lordsreformbishopswillstay.html) simply because they're Christian - they're not elected and have no particular/required skills afaik.    

* [Parliament starting with prayer](http://www.secularism.org.uk/end-prayers-in-parliament-says-l.html).    

* [Local council meetings](http://www.secularism.org.uk/council-prayers.html) containing prayer.

* [A non-CoE member can't be king or queen](http://www.secularism.org.uk/disestablishmentraisesitsheadaga.html) - the law denies the right of our monarch to be irreligious/not CoE.    

* [1/3 of UK schools being run by faith groups](http://www.secularism.org.uk/religion-in-schools.html) - Why else would they want to run a school if it were not the wish to *teach* children that particular religion? Which leads us to:

* [Faith schools being exempt from equality laws](http://www.secularism.org.uk/faith-school-employment-discrimi.html) which mean they can sack/not hire a teacher on the sole basis that that teacher isn't the right/any religion.

* [Various religious exemptions](http://www.secularism.org.uk/nss-forces-government-to-remove.html) which allow them to sack/not hire someone on the basis of their sexuality.

Should I go on? It doesn't matter how little sway it has: It is where it *does* hold sway that is the issue. One person suffering discrimination is too much.

&gt;  Faith schools aren't necessarily bad things in themselves

Forcing a religion on a child in a state endorsed learning environment is unacceptable. Remember it is *one* religion that the child is being taught about - religious education is not the same as religious *instruction*. Many people don't seem to be able to 'get' this and I think it's because they're used to Christianity and see it as harmless. Have you considered that a child being instructed in Christianity at school is pretty much the same as a child being instructed in Islam, or Hinduism, or Voodooism?    
They're all religions, but I would question how many parents would be happy with their child going to any faith school other than Christian based. (excluding the person (and similar) I was speaking to the other day who was happy with a religion that had similar values to his own).

&gt; I'm just used to the overblown reaction these things tend to get from the anti-religious crowd (as opposed to the non-religious).

*Secularism* is **not** atheism or anti-theism. Please read or listen to what is being said, not what you perhaps think is being said. For all you know, I could be a Christian. There are secularists of faith - not many, but they do exist. Many people from minority religions recognise the importance of secularism, though not so much their leaders as I've mentioned elsewhere.

What exactly is overblown? Which of the various campaigns in recent years do you think frivolous and unimportant and how are they inconsistent with the overall goal and aims of secularism? Please, I really would like examples because otherwise it's a hand wavey dismissal of a group standing up for the rights of the majority of people in this country, most of whom don't seem to recognise that. Or maybe they've [listened to people like this too much.](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/4170204.stm)

&gt;  It's something to keep an eye on, but it's not the dawn of an oppressive theocracy.

[You mean like this sort of thing?](http://www.secularism.org.uk/christianity-should-dominate-all.html) (He's in the Lords btw) That's the sort of thing secularists and the NSS campaign about. Would that not fall into your ""over reaction"" catagory? With most other issues: The religious right in this country have learned from their US counterparts and are being very, *very* sneaky these days. You may not realise but if you take the time to read around you'll understand what I mean. Consider the recent proposals made by Nadine Dorries et al about ""abstience"" education for girls in school. She knows what she's doing and realises that she needs to go via [Salami tactics](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=IX_d_vMKswE#t=78s). Such people are also (I believe) getting funding from across the pond. I don't know if you're aware of various issues in the US at the moment, but I'm sure you can understand the terrible problems of [things like this.](http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/jun/24/america-pregnant-women-murder-charges) Have you read ""A Handmaid's Tale"" by Margaret Atwood? I really recommend it, particularly if you have an interest in sex education and women's reproductive rights.

&gt;  I think the real reason is not their belief

If the Bishops did not believe in their god, they would not be there. Obviously the system allows for it, but my point stands. If they believed in Vishnu, they'd lose their seat.

&gt; Are you actually comparing the UK to Iran?

I said *nothing* but that both the UK and Iran have un-elected clergy in their government. That's the only comparison I made and I think it stands on its own merit. You don't have to assume I'm hysterical, I'm really not! But as I spend much of my time reading, writing and talking about these issues I'm quite aware of all the aspects of religious influence. And obviously I think any non-private endorsement/support for religion is wrong. I'm not overreacting but merely stating a fact about the Iran thing. You say the Lords doesn't have much power? I somewhat disagree.     
But with regards to reform, it doesn't seem to be going the right way as the most recent proposal (I believe) would result in the [proportion of Bishops actually being higher after the change](http://www.secularism.org.uk/reform-proposals-will-increase-p.html).

I don't expect you to read all the links - I use them as examples of how this issue isn't simply a group of killjoys nit-picking at religious people. The issues are widespread and varied, but ultimately they are being combated to prevent religious privilege and influence where it should not (or does not) have a right to be.

Something that really needs to be remembered: People of faith can be secularists too (and many are, when they really think about it) and secularism actually protects religious minorities from the (tyranny of) the majority.

Transcript:

""Here we are on the edge of a financial and social disaster and in the room today we have the four men who are supposed to be responsible. And yet we have listened to the dullest most, technocratic speeches I've ever heard. 

You are all in denial. By any objective measure the euro is a failure. And who exactly is responsible, who is in charge out of all you lot? The answer is none of you because none of you have been elected; none of you have any democratic legitimacy for the roles you currently hold within this crisis. 

And into this vacuum, albeit reluctantly, has stepped Angela Merkel. And we are now living in a German-dominated Europe - something that the European project was actually supposed to stop. Something that those who went before us actually paid a heavy price in blood to prevent. I don't want to live in a German-dominated Europe and nor do the citizens of Europe. 

But you guys have played a role, because when Mr Papandreou got up and used the word 'referendum' - or Mr Rehn, you described it as 'a breach of confidence', and your friends here got together like a pack of hyenas, rounded on Papandreou, had him removed and replaced by a puppet Government. What an absolutely disgusting spectacle that was.

And not satisfied with that, you decided that Berlesconi had to go. So he was removed and replaced by Mr Monti, a former European Commissioner, a fellow architect of this Euro disaster and a man who wasn't even a member of parliament. 

It's getting like an Agatha Christie novel, where we're trying to work out who is the next person that's going to be bumped off. The difference is, we know who the villains are. You should all be held accountable for what you've done. You should all be fired. 

And I have to say, Mr Van Rompuy. 18 months ago when we first met, I was wrong about you. I said you would be the quiet assassin of nation states' democracy, but not anymore, you are rather noisy about it aren't you. You, an unelected man, went to Italy and said, 'This is not the time for elections but the time for actions'. What in God's name gives you the right to say that to the Italian people.",0,1324649876,null,0,false,0,c3ak9tc,t3_nntvh,t1_c3ak9tc,t3_nntvh,1428065162,10,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,10

true,Ouro,null,null,"Personally I feel that the concept of the EU is a good thing, however the execution leaves something to be desired.

Notably there seems to be a distinct lack of democracy in the literal sense, that all adult citizens have a say, rather it seems to be more along the lines of a talking shop for national governments. This isn’t an uncommon criticism of the EU and it’s often touted by various political parties as why the EU is a bad thing. Though they seem to be a bit more reticent about pushing for the necessary reforms to make the EU more democratic as increasing the EU’s legitimacy would place a higher democratic authority above themselves, indeed I imagine that some find it rather useful to have the EU as some distant anti democratic bogeyman. Just look at the tensions about making the Horse of Lords more democratic.

Regarding the Euro: certainly now isn’t the best time to join, but personally I would be happy to convert as long as there is real economic reform across the EU. While I can understand people’s attachment to the Pound as a sense of national identity - even if I don’t agree with it - I’d feel their arguments might carry a bit more weight if the currency they’re attached to out of a sense of historic pride had essentially existed prior to 1971 i.e. the move from pounds, shillings and pence to decimalisation.",0,1324650042,null,0,false,0,c3akae7,t3_nnv7w,t1_c3akae7,t3_nnv7w,1428065169,7,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,7
true,widgetas,null,null,"&gt; I'm sorry, 

Naaaah, you're not. You had your say and ignored mine ;)

With regards to ""don't expect you to read"": I have to say I think you read that line wrong and not the way it was intended. I thought about wording it differently and perhaps should have said it thus:

""I am not asking you to read all the links, they are simply there as examples of what I am talking about.""

What I meant was: I understand that there's a shit load of info here. Don't worry, I won't be asking questions later.

With regards to the rest of your reasoning: Yes, I understand that you might not want to be as 'outraged' as some of us seem to be, but really I would ask you not to apparently dismiss us for it which you seemed to do several times in your first comment. I'm not saying the NSS is ""holding back the tide"" or similar, but without people like the NSS then various religious groups would quietly chip away at what secularism we might have. Christianity has a self proclaimed mission to 'spread the word', don't forget - a religion exists to perpetuate its existence, amongst other things.

The NSS, BHA, Liberty etc. play important roles and I don't think it's fair to dismiss them as ""anti-religious"" simply because you may not understand or agree with one or two particular campaigns.

&gt; Poor form perhaps

It is a bit, yes. It implies that neither of us has an open mind or can bring anything new to the table to consider. I don't know about you, but that isn't my position. I don't mind being challenged - it's how I can come by being able to write a comment like the one above.

One final thing: Please, try not to equate secularism or secular campaign groups with anti-religion.

ps - Neither of my comments to you have been written in anger or in a tetchy mood, and the tone isn't supposed to be arsey. Just so we're clear :)

edit - I should also add though, that as you've decided not to read my comment where I clarify certain assertions you've made, all you've done is ensured you continue to think a certain way without considering the possibility that you have the wrong idea: i.e. You think *I* think that the UK and Iran are comparable in more than the clergy-in-government thing.

true,McCackle,eng-sussex,West Sussex,"&gt; The NSS, BHA, Liberty etc. play important roles and I don't think it's fair to dismiss them as ""anti-religious"" simply because you may not understand or agree with one or two particular campaigns.

*sighs* I didn't do that, I didn't say that. I remarked that I didn't see the subject of this thread as a particularly serious threat to secularism as it's just a politician paying lip service. I went on to remark that *some* organisations might well want to make more of it, but that their doing so would be driven more by their wider agenda than anything else. So far, so uncontroversial.

*You*, my good man, then brought in the wider issues and I was initially happy to respond. My 'anti-religious crowd' comment, which you've taken as a blanket condemnation of all secularists/humanists even though it was nothing of the sort, was simply an observation that some people, not all, are indeed anti-religion as well as pro-secularism, and they are more often than not the source of hyperbole in the debate.

I respect and support the NSS and the BHA, and I'm a member of Liberty. You've read my comments as being dismissive of them, when at worst (if you make the assumption that I was even referring to them to begin with) I've pointed out that lobbying organisations tend to lobby aggressively for their position and sometimes they make a mountain out of a molehill. I really don't think this is a massively controversial point.

Whilst I was happy to engage with your initial comments as to why I felt this was indeed a molehill and not a mountain, as soon as you deployed your wall of text in a bid to educate me on the importance of secularism I'm afraid we were talking at cross-purposes and it would have been pointless to continue.",0,1324655499,null,0,false,0,c3akvcl,t3_nmukc,t1_c3akvcl,t1_c3akajw,1428065444,-1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,-1

true,questionman1,null,null,"Neutral here, came by to post something, saw this and thought to chime in:

2.)  Who's leaving...well this is a quandry but it seems clear that two players are definitely unwanted: in Bridge and Tevez.  Whether the club is able to shift them or not, is another matter.  I think the club will also try to shif Onuoha as well.  I think temporary interest was shown in him merely as a way to placate the family and thus protect teh club from any possible legal action regarding the Cook saga.  

3.) Gaps...well there are two that I can think off.  First after seeing point 2, it's clear that a lot of back up defenders are not really wanted.  Combine that with the fact that Kolo is leaving for ACN, City will be spread rather thin defensively.  Savic, while promising, does seem a little rusty (if City was looking for a bargain they should have bought Raphael Varane...my word he looks absolutely phenomenal.  But I think that is the difference between Real's scouting network vs. City's).

Another gap that needs to be filled also deals with ACN, in the form of Yaya leaving.  I know Hargreaves was brought in as a potential replacement, but nothing I've seen thus far (in fairness I don't knwo how well he trains) seems ot suggest that he's a real quality player.  His movement in both CC games has been atrocious and I felt that (particularly in the Arsenal CC game) City was only playing with 10 men.  But it's clear he's not going to be a direct replacement per se, rather just a back up.

On the plus side, I hope this gives De Jong a chance to play regularly once more (I have no clue as to why City isn't starting him...too many hospital bills from other clubs maybe).  I like him, and it sort of worries me to see him sidelined by the club.  But I do fear that his inclusion will mark the beginning of a more defensive City.  I do suspect that City's possesion and goal tally will go down if Mancini does a straight swap between Yaya and De Jong.

1.)  Who's coming?  Well, see point 3.  In reality, I hope no one does.  The club does have some gaps, but I hope Mancini trusts his youth team a little to plug any holes that may arise.  That's what Barca and other European powerhouses do...I'd like to see City adopt that mentality as well.

Granted I've only seen them a few times, but I've become very interested in the futures of Abdul Razak, Dennis Suarez, and Luca Scapuzzi (in my eyes, one of hte most impressive players in the Carling Cup game against Wolves, a joy to watch).  While I don't know much about him, I hear a lot of City fans talking about Karim Rekik, so I think he deserves a chance at first-team action as well.

City is investing a massive amount into their academy, so I think they should take advantage of it as well.

In my 'wall of text comment' (you don't have to read replies, of course, or even acknowledge them) I asked which particular religious influence was, in your opinion, 'OK', because I'm not sure that anyone who calls out Cameron on this would be unaware of the other issues or not talk about them. Secular issues can't really be viewed in isolation, as far as I've come to be aware. When it comes to the ""Pedant"" aspects, the issue is generally one of principle. Consider the Woking churches being given parking permits/free parking on Sundays - that would be a matter of principle to the NSS.

Your point is somewhat... confusing to me. I asked for specific examples because you seem to be disapproving of people who would comment on what you would deem unimportant or use one point to raise a more issues. I'm not sure these things can be viewed in isolation: Cameron has done numerous things in the last few weeks/months that have riled the NSS, this just adds to the list.

I'm not a big fan of some of the things that go on, yeah I like the TV shows that show the reality of war and what it's actually like out there in Afghanistan, but the Millies get on my tits, they really do. A lot of my fellow military types would disagree though, so I think I'm in the minority there. 

Armed Forces day is one I personally REALLY dislike, because what happens is that it actually becomes a hassle trying to sort out events etc for it. Seriously I'd rather the day didn't even exist, I have enough work to do as it is without that taking up my time.

Help for Heroes is a good thing but more recently it's actually harming donations to other institutions (like the various benevolent funds, the legion etc) which not only help out wounded people, but are also there for people who just get into hard times during or after their careers . Sometimes I think H4H is more about those running it being really into getting publicity rather than being well structured and doing the best it can. That said though, it's better than nothing and definitely helps people out when they need it. 

This is a war, rightly or wrongly it's going on, I personally think we're doing a lot of damn good work over there and saving many more lives than are being lost. We're not doing too badly when it comes down to the actual numbers of dead when you compare it to other wars in the past 100 years or so. People do die in war, that's the nature of the beast. 

As for whether we should actually be at war, well there is no way I can actually give any kind of good answer on that, despite having done two Afghanistan trips in the past two years, because there's SO much I don't know for sure about reasonings behind decisions etc, based upon what I've seen out there, I think our troops are saving lives, doing a good job and that Afghanistan will be a better country for it in the future, that's all I can say really.

Air Dominance could be restablished after the Type 45s have knocked every non-British thing out of the sky, and Close Air Support could be provided by Carrier launched Apaches (yes we still actually have aircraft carriers, they just carry helicopters).

We have HMS Ocean, HMS Albion, HMS Bulwark, RFA Lyme Bay, RFA Cardigan Bay and RFA Mount Bay to launch 3 Commando Brigade and any army units that tag along, from both by air (helicopter assault from HMS Ocean) and the sea. And then we could drop 16th Air Assault Brigade in via parachute.

Instead, they would wander eternity alone and repent their sins... until death comes to Time.""

Ill dig out my CD copy later and transcribe the full quote.

As for Time Lord abilities: Time Lords have minor telepathic powers that apparently can only be used by physical contact. The Tardis has a ""telepathic circuit"" that augment this ability, as well as grant the ability to communicate with most other languages. They also have a binary vascular system (two hearts), which apparently makes them more physically robust, and can take more punishment as well as can heal quicker from things like injury, poison, radiation, etc. Time lords also possess a ""respiratory bypass system,"" which means they can go for extended periods of time without breathing.

In the audio adventures, it's mentioned that Time Lords also possess a lot more senses than humans, a few of which are dedicated to sensing time and time related stuff.

The Doctor has also seen a lot of stuff and has a lot of skills, which are usually made up by the writers as the need arises. Most notably, ""Venusian Aikido,"" a martial art designed for beings with five arms and five legs, which the Third Doctor used a lot. On a side note, I'd love to see this used in the modern series once in a while.

I think the oppression of racism is a bit dangerous because it creates a false sense of security. As you say you are unaware of such views because you are not their for the other context. The suppression doesn't change minds and instead hides it.

For me the suppression of racism has become a bit of an automatic response for many. You often hear people saying ""that's racist"" when it's not appropriate, so keen are they to participate, even if it's in an intellectually lazy way. If we had a less reactionary approach it might help get this significant minority out in the open and then a debate may occur that further reduces this hardcore element. It's clear that though the situation in the UK is far better than it was the dogma approach may have it's limits and it may now be time to shift to a different strategy.

My main point may be that it would be wiser to look at the data the USA has already provided through a few years of Taser use, and to realise it would be far easier to simply block the initial authorisation of their use instead of reversing it once it gets too commonplace and out of hand, as it has done over there.

Unfortunately it is is a fact of life that officers are called to deal with armed people. It may not be a daily occurrence but it is certainly common, more so than you'd think.

I do understand you concerns over Taser usage and their possible consequences however if you are standing in the street waving a knife or something similar around your possibility of fatality also increases, whether by Taser or something else.

I encourage you to actually look at the figures for Taser useage, especially around Taser being linked to deaths. Specifically Taser has been identified as a *secondary* factor in deaths where other conditions have been present, for example weak heart, drug use, alcohol abuse, etc.

It is sad when anyone dies unnecessarily but when you put yourself in a situation where you are threatening the lives of innocent people, including police officers, you run the risk of losing yours - accidentally or even being shot properly. The way this man is running at officers an armed officer could legally shoot him, he is threatening their lives.

I believe we will never agree over this issue as we look at it from two different sides. In the interests of disclosure I have been in similar circumstances called to a man with a knife and I was armed with CS and a baton - it is not much against a knife, especially if CS doesn't work (it only works on about 90% of people).

Although I think Comolli chose Henderson.  As well, I don't think Jose Enrique was first choice for either.  Comolli has been scouting some of the top youth prospects around the world and it is time FSG let him loose to buy some.  I think the squad is a left sided centre half to eventually succeed Agger and offer cover in the meantime (unless the coaching staff is that high on Danny Wilson), another central midfielder, preferrably one with strong defensive abilities.  We need a couple players that can do something with the ball, one winger and one who can play centrally behind the strikers.  And obviously we need a goalscorer.  I think if we get the right player behind Suarez that will free him up to play more as a striker and more goals will come from that.  Gaston Ramirez would be great, Georginio Wijnaldum looks like a great addition to our squad as well.  I thought Eduardo Vargas would have been great but that ship sailed.

Novels: Right, if you want to read arc stories you will need to read: Timewyrm: Revelation, Cat's Cradle: Time's Crucible, Cat's Cradle: Witch Mark, Lungbarrow. Not many really. 

But...if you just want some great stories:

New Adventures - Timewyrm: Exodus, Timewyrm: Revelation, Cat's Cradle: Warhead (first part of the War Trilogy), Nightshade, Love And War, Lucifer Rising, White Darkness, Birthright, Iceberg, Blood Heat, The Left-Handed Hummingbird, Conundrum, No Future, Tragedy Day, Legacy, Theatre Of War, All-Consuming Fire, Blood Harvest, First Frontier, Warlock (War: 2), Set Piece, Sanctuary, Human Nature, Original Sin, Toy Soldiers, Head Games, Just War, Warchild (War: 3), SLEEPY, Death And Diplomacy, Happy Endings, Return Of The Living Dad, Damaged Goods (RTD's Novel), So Vile A Sin, Bad Therapy, Eternity Weeps, The Room With No Doors, Lungbarrow

PDA's - The Hollow Men, Bullet Time, Relative Dementias, Heritage, The Algebra Of Ice

Second Doctor: Good second Doctor novels...oooo...The Roundheads, The Dark Path (gives you the origin of the Master!), Dreams Of Empire...surprisingly the second Doctor had the worst run of novels as authors found it difficult to get to grips with him. Shame really

* This may be the best move for both Gary Cahill and Chelsea as Bolton is now in the 19th position and have a high chance of being relegated. 

* Gary Cahill will not be club tied for CL matches.

* Phil Jones was virtually unknown with only 35 appearances since 2009 at Blackburn and broke into Man Utd starting 11 this season as one of the most exciting players to watch on their team. There's a possibility Gary Cahill could do the same at Chelsea and he had 127 appearances with 12 goals for Bolton.

* £7 million for a home grown player who's ready to start is great business.

* Gary Cahill and JT played along side each other for England so teamwork and understanding should not be an issue between the two. (vs. bringing in a foreign player who's learning english) ",0,1324691472,null,0,false,0,c3apzmc,t3_nohk4,t1_c3apzmc,t3_nohk4,1428067925,9,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,9

Because as far as I know if we leave the EU we'll put so much legislation in place, we might as well be in the EU again.

3. The fruit shape thing is what's called a euromyth. Actually what happened is legislation was passed to put bananas in categories based on their characteristics.

One of our biggest problems is that we have a Trade Deficit. Most of this is with Europe, we do have a Trade Surplus with the rest of the world.


Inflation may hit us hard but it leaving the EU may be a credible way to make our Trade Deficit shrink or even balance the books. While we could do this with devaluation, this would limit out Monetary and Fiscal Policies and could damage our Credit Ratings and Financial Sector.



Leaving the EU, suffering taxes and trade restrictions could make our own markets more competitive and could lead to trade increasing significantly.




A lot of pain but a lot of gain. It's just a thought: not a practical one, nor a feasible one but certainly it makes sense in a purely theoretical sense

You don't need to show them in the season finale, and the writers are free to bump them off without getting any kind of permission. 

He went overboard with minor characters, not one-episode charaters. Such as when Donna, The Doctor, The Doctor's clone, Captain Jack Harkness, Rose, Rose's mother, Micky, Martha Jones, Sarah Jane, Mr. Smith, K9, Gwen Cooper, Ianto Jones, and the late Harriet Jones (former Prime Minister and MP for Flydale North, yet another unrelated Jones) ALL contributed to the defeat of the Daleks. I think one was killed off for good.

There's too many episodes in the new series that don't have potential victims. You *know* the little spooky kid will live, the Doctor and companions can only die in a series final, and most of the rest of the rest of the cast is so boring you don't care if they make it.

I think Henderson is a great signing - he's incredibly young, and I think he's been relatively solid.  Maybe not amazing, but I think he's held up his end reasonably well.  Carroll is potentially still a very good buy, although he has some maturing and integrating to do.  Enrique is fantastic, Adam has been good for the money (albeit frustrating at times) and Suarez is Suarez.  Downing is the only one i'm really disappointed in, but on paper it sounded like a good buy to me.

I would very much like to see us sign a striker and a defensive mid (even if Lucas is only out for the season, I think we could definitely do with some depth there, and I'm not sure Spearing is enough).  I wouldn't mind a winger, either.

Podolski or Cavani would be tremendous buys, but I'm not certain we can afford them or if they'd want to come.  Sissoko would be tremendous, as would Tiote (although his utility is limited for us right away, due to the African Cup of Nations).

One name I haven't seen mentioned, and would like to see (although I might be alone in it) is Steven Fletcher.  He's not a superstar striker, but I think he is underrated and would do a hell of a job for us.

On the continent, I get the impression that there is great movements and sentiment towards coming together. Being connected by invisible borders, being able to speak each other's languages, having the same coinage, etc has given mainland Europe some kind of common identity. The political ideology being peddled and focused upon by mainland Europe's leaders is for everyone to come together, because we're all Europeans.

But I just don't think that Britain as a whole shares that ideology, perhaps because we're too busy having our own internal struggle with identity. Scotland and Wales are both taking steps towards devolution, whilst there are more calls for England and Northern Ireland to get their own exclusive parliaments too. You can then start dividing things again until ad nauseum, such as being North and South, Londoner or not, by class, culture, whatever.   

But that argument has a fatal flaw. I really don't think that the United Kingdom has a talent to express and vocalise nationality (or even any kind of membership) that particularly well. I may well have grown up in a social-anomaly, but few people in my schools or college knew our national anthem, nobody really took interest in the Royal family, or really did anything else to express their allegiance to anything. Admittedly, most of us shared some common traits, such as having a soft-spot for tea, but I don't think that defined us. I think that what is defining my surrounding peers, and perhaps others too, is that we would rather define ourselves than be defined and grouped into one large mass, be it land or anything else. I'm not saying that we're not proud to be British, but we are more proud being ourselves.

So with our internal politics moving towards us dividing ourselves, and our culture moving towards us being individuals, it would be inconsistent of us to consider ourselves European. That's probably the main difference, we don't consider ourselves European, so that's why we're not.",0,1324709301,null,0,true,0,c3as686,t3_nnv7w,t1_c3as686,t1_c3aqcfd,1428068954,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

You are aware of British Leyland, whose workers were constantly on strike and when they were working made entirely shite, low quality cars? Yet their privately owned competitors and indeed foreign manufacturers soundly whipped them.

&gt; lso, elected or not, to give sell what our fathers and grandfathers built for the country so the boomers and her Tory mates could make a couple of quid; is morally and socially irresponsible.

It is obvious that you don't agree with it, others (like me) disagree that the government is the only outfit that can own things like this.

Indeed, the state never owned British Rail from the beginning - they only nationalised it after things started to go wrong for the various railway companies in the 1940s. Telephones were not state owned from the beginning either - they were nationalised too.

&gt; Those companies belonged to the people. Not to terms of governments. If she have licensed the right of management to relevant companies with review for a period of time. Fine. But to sell lock stock? Who will benefit long term? 

The taxpayer benefited from a large surplus of cash. They weren't given away, they were sold.

&gt; Ask any commuter how their train journey is, how much is it compared to the rest of europe? 

If you read my comment I did say that rail privatisation hasn't been great, but to compare us to Europe is a bit poor. All rail companies in Europe receive subsidy to some degree. Including ours. How much does ours get vs. Deutsche Bahn or SNCF? That may explain differences in fares. Is the service itself better? More comprehensive? etc.

&gt; Ask the families of the people in the potters bar incident if they felt Jarvis did a good enough job.

You are aware that private contractors routinely handle maintenance and renewal even under the state owned, yet ""for profit"" ""private"" Network Rail? Let's be honest, things have not been peachy back under state ownership.

I don't appreciate the attempt at heart tugging with the ""ask the families of"".

&gt;  Or ask all the people defecting from BT with their farmed out support lines, their call hold hell, their patchy service (I was a BT costumer). 

The nice thing is that you don't have to be with BT if you don't want to. I live in a rural area and BT are not my internet provider, although I am with them for phone. As it happens BT is actually *moving support back to the UK*.

&gt; Or perhaps ask why: to improve the electrical supply in my building I have to call the same place 4 times just to get the right forms to do it. Let alone the ""from 140 - 5000 Gbp"" price tag once they decide to do it. 

The National Grid is not responsible for that, unless you're a major power generator. They don't run the local electricity networks that connect homes and businesses to the actual National Grid. Like how the Highways Agency runs the motorways and A-roads and the local council runs the rest.

I don't understand your point here - there is a cost to the labour and materials required to improve your supply and it isn't cheap.

true,dotben,null,null,"As a former BBC employee who watches the organization closely still, I can tell you this is just the beginning of the decrease in funding that the BBC has to play with.

BBC suddenly pulled out of paying for the full schedule for live F1 for next year, they've scaled back the amount of online content (ie web pages, not iPlayer) and have openly stated there will be more repeats because the overall amount of new programming broadcast will be less.

This is because the government said that the BBC couldn't increase the license fee and so with inflation has a net decrease in funding year-on-year.

A second factor to consider particularly with regard to comedy is that we're still seeing the fallout from the 'Sachs-gate affair' involving Russell Brand and Jonathan Ross.  Editorially there is far less risk taking then there was 5 years ago, especially for new edgy comedy.

To make matters worse, ""trusted"" stalwarts like Matt Lucas and David Walliams who have a little more leeway than new writers + producers have not helped or move things forward with blunders such as 'blacking up' to portray characters in ""Come Fly With Me"", which causes a fair amount of outcry in the media and within some inside circles.

Finally, another trend I'm seeing as I live in the US now, is the increase in programming imported from the UK -- either directly or as US versions filmed for the US audience based on buying the rights to the format and script.

I am sensing there is a greater desire when commissioning television, especially at cash-strapped BBC and Channel 4, to ensure any programming made can be shown in the US market too.  The net effect of that is more 'mainstream' stuff is made like Luther, Spooks (MI5 here) and less abstract and odd-ball programmes League of Gentleman which wouldn't have appeal here to a mainstream US market.

true,dayus9,eng-gloucestershire,Lincs,"That's so hard to answer properly, so I'm gonna probably just cobble together some random thoughts and try to make it coherent. 


Look at Afghanistan as a whole now... and I don't just mean the fairly developed cities like Kabul, Kandahar etc, but the whole place. Look back at the US or the UK and how far back do you have to go til you can think of either of those countries being in a similar state of development? It's going to take decades for that country to become stable. 


Even in the UK it's not so long ago since we had the IRA etc blowing up people left right and centre.... it takes a bloody long time. They are on the path to stability but they've got a long way to go and I think a lot of people expect it to happen overnight (relatively, not actually overnight obviously) and that's just not realistic. 


The drug situation there isn't going to help. If I was an Afghan and could get away with growing opium poppies for a good profit instead of normal crops, I probably would, because it would feed my family and the people I love. In their situation I would definitely be doing that, and one of the main reasons would be because.... well.... I wouldn't give a shit what drugs are doing to people in other countries, I'd be trying to live and stay alive in one of the nastiest places to live in the world. If anyone thinks your average Afghan farmer should care about drug addicts in the UK dying because of their drugs, you're expecting way too much. 


In my time out there it was drilled into me and everyone else that the job out there is to fight the insurgents, protect the civilian population and help the Afghans help themselves. Don't get me wrong, I expect the politicians are gonna be wanting some stuff out of this, but them being sly bastards in that respect doesn't (IMO) damage the good we are actually doing. 


It's all well and good people saying 'Well British lives are being lost for a bunch of fuzzy wuzzies' or whatever, but the people of Afghanistan are generally a nice bunch of people trying to do the best with their lives in REALLY shite conditions, they laugh, they cry, they have kids they love and in those respects they're not that different from anyone else. Yes they have some dodgy traditions that I'm not a fan of, but it IS getting better. We cannot and should not force a culture change on them, they have to be allowed to develop in the way that is right for them, which is exactly what we in more developed countries were able to do in times gone past, we just did it a bit more quickly. They ARE a different type of people and they need time to see how they are going to develop. 


I think the worst thing that could happen is that in 2014 we pull out our combat troops (note combat troops, I expect us to still have a military presence there for a fucking long time) and we kind of just forget about the place and leave it to the Afghans, a bit like we have done with Iraq actually. We must continue to help out the country and its people. 


I hope to be going out again in 2013, so I'll have to wait until then to see what changes there will have been, it should be interesting to see how the transition of security from ISAF to the ANA goes. There is NO way it will be as good as it is now, but that's to be expected, their forces aren't as good as ours and we can't expect them to be. 

One final point from me on the original topic. I personally don't want a load of parades and shit for the work I do. I am paid to do a job and I do it to the best of my ability because 1. I am a professional and 2. I believe what I do saves lives and makes the world a better place. 


**Tl;dr** - I think it's possible for Afghanistan to be stable at some point in the distant future. And yes I think the reasons we were given for war are correct, just maybe with a few other reasons omitted.

I've seen a couple of posts on here saying that you can live on minimum wage; What's not being mentioned is that your calculations are unjust as the standard working week is actually 37.5 hours not 40. This means that if you were on minimum wage (Don't forget you only get the £6.08 rate if you're over 21 too!) Your Net monthly earning after Tax and NI will be £868.70. 

On that you could afford to share a rented home, but fi you live where I do you would deffinitely need a car so say good bye to another £300 a month on fuel, running costs, and heaven forbid id you actually want a fairly decent car and not an old banger.

Thinking this may have a bigger part to play than say the stock footage of a tree frog (as an example of the kind of stuff they use) and he was being diplomatic and dare I say deflecting attention. I've worked in TV for 20 years and had some involvement in clearances. The kind of generic stuff on QI is really not overly expensive footage compared to some. If it were scenes from The Wizard of Oz or similar then oh ya, that would be expensive.  But invariably its  BBC's own footage they use and is often natural world orientated.  I do understand its made by an independent for BBC but rights clearances and royalty payments would have been part of the negotiated contract for the show.  The BBC makes countless programmes that get shown on BBC America that have far more onerous issues with clips.    I still think it may have something to do with having to renegotiate the contracts of the presenters for US (North American) exploitation and them having to be paid a bit more.... possibly.    
  
What I am trying to say is the clearances issue simply isn't an insurmountable mountain to climb here.  That sort of stuff is the everyday business of BBC; stuff get's cleared for US use ALL THE TIME.  Its odd that its the reason given, but I think there is more to it than just the clearance of library footage.  I just do.

Not in 2001, there was no ""Al Qaeda network"". In fact, they didn't really have any ""power"" back then either. Bin Laden was mostly just the fat rich kid that the others tolerate because of his toys. They hired ""extras"" for their recruitment video to make themselves larger than they were, they even had to bring their own guns!

Even in the years following the groups who named themselves things like ""Al Qaeda in Iraq"" had no actual connection to them besides the PR-friendly name that guaranteed them news coverage. We've created a ""brand"" for terrorism. Over time they cultivated more ""direct"" links but even these were a pretty tenuous interpretation of the Six-Degrees of Kevin Bacon game.

&gt; It seems to me that if Afghanistan could become a fairly stable country that it would help improve global stability. 

Then you have only been paying attention to officially sanctioned news like the BBC. Try some alternate media and read up on just how bad the Northern Alliance is. They are ideologically identical to the Taliban, they simply represent different tribes that have been warring for a millennia. There are mass graves with their names on them, they'd lock 50-odd people in cargo containers and simply leave them to die. They only allow female schools so long as western eyes are watching, and in very limited, PR-friendly forms. Their warlords kidnap and rape women, then have them stoned to death for it. This law was one of the very first they passed when the US put them in charge, though they did say to the west that they'd use ""small stones"". Good luck finding that official announcement from their Justice Minister mentioned on the BBC! Historically it was them that first introduced Sharia Law to Afghanistan. The public have been massively lied to as to the purpose of the regime change. 

Long term Iraq is almost certainly going to fracture into full-blown civil war, the seeds are already there with the political moves this week with the opposition party Sunni Vice-President being indited for ""corruption"" by the ruling Shai PM. Long term this might work OK because the Iraqi borders defined by the UK when they concurred the region in WW1 were specifically designed to create ethnic unrest. Having these warring tribes in separate countries e.g. a Kurdish state may be necessary to end the 100 years of internal conflict we very deliberately created as part of standard British ""divide and conquer"" doctrine. But the ""Partitioning of Iraq"" (as the historians will ultimately call it) will undoubtedly be far more bloody than the partitioning of India which happened largely because of the same reasons i.e. British-defined borders.

The reason I disagreed with the FA is that they've made a decision to ban Suarez, hence implying he's a racist, based on no evidence. They could have easily have found Suarez not guilty and still made a statement saying, 'If there was evidence to suggest Suarez was guilty he would have been banned for 8 games and fined; this sanction will apply in future incidents as well'. That statement would suggest the FA trusts it's players enough and that the campaigns to stamp out racism **are** working. Instead the FA are saying racism is rife in football and Suarez is the man to burn at the stake. 

Look at what has happened though. The anti-racism campaigners aren't happy with the conduct if Liverpool Football Club. Suarez is being made out to be a racist... Fuck.

If you look at him vs Dzeko at Man City for example, can you say Dzeko was treated similarly? Dzeko moved to City for 27 mil, was playing fairly regularly and really did not perform at all to expectation. But I think his failures were overlooked due to the whole Carroll/Torres circus. It wasn't until the beginning of this season that Dzeko started showing some form, and even that has waned as he has found himself subbing on more than starting. All this for a striker who is 3 years older than Carroll. I know it's hard to take, but we paid too much for Andy, there's nothing that can be done about that now.

In the handbook, page 112:

Handling the ball involves a deliberate act of a player making contact with the ball with his hand or arm.  The referee must take the following into consideration:

* the movement of the hand towards the ball (not the ball towards the hand)
* the position of the hand does not necessarily mean that there is an infringement

Cole's hand was in a completely natural position, and did not move from where it would have been if he had simply been running.  It was a case of ball to hand, not the other was around, and was not deliberate.  I don't see anyway under those rules that it should have been a handball.  Webb immediately signaled there was no violation, and I think he was correct in this case.

I think Webb's the best referee in England.  I'm sure Adebayor would have been sent off by many others, but he made an effort to make sure the game stayed 11v11, and I think he was correct given that none of Ade's fouls were malicious at all.

i don't think he's actually read it, it's not really *that* hateful, it was written before he did the whole jew thing and started being a right meanie.

However, in all seriousness, i don't see a problem with promoting this book as an 'essential read', i think any book which is going to challenge the views of the reader is worth reading, especially when it's steeped in history like Mein Kampf is.

I've read the book, it's pretty shittily written tbh, and i wouldn't recommend it based on that, but i think it's a curiosity piece for a lot of people. They know it's not the best writing in the world, but it was written by Hitler, one of history's most infamous figures.

Apparently we do. It's been happening for a few years now, but the current govt has made it quite explicit that they want the charity sector to take up a lot of things that for the last 50 or so years were done by the state.

That means that charities who want to provide services have to raise money, and I would hope that they do so in the most effective manner possible. If that means they advertise, use chuggers etc, then I assume they have done this because they have to, because it is only by shoving it in our faces that they can make us contribute.

If these adverts are effective (and I presume they are, otherwise why use them) then I do not understand the objection to them. They seem to me to be an inevitable result of the policies promoting individual responsibility over the control by state approach to dealing with the vulnerable.

Really, the only alternative that I can think of to having the disadvantaged begging money from those of us in a slightly better position, is to perhaps have everyone pay a small sum from their wages toward a large fund which would help the unfortunates.

Ishmael, when he saw Queequog, considered him scary and different because he was ignorant of racial differences, but nonetheless considered that ""a man could be honest in any skin"". They bonded during the voyage through common experience, at one point Queequog attended a Ishmael's christian service and Ishmael went to Queequog's voodoo ceremony, amongst other things. At the end when Captain Ahab met Moby Dick and the ship sank it was through Queequog's friendship Ishmael became the sole survivor of the entire crew. But anyway the point is to achieve true racial reconciliation and equality we must reduce the emotional and identity distance through common experience and empathy - Political Correctness - the fact that we cannot call a black person nigger, or any other racial slur - without the inequality that use to connote it (as you might notice now, what I am arguing against is the instant incrimination of the speaker of those racial slurs without the consideration of context and meaning) - is the absolute apposite of being equal - what we are doing is merely ""wishing our differences away"" by perpetuating the idea that there's a different protocol that one must adjust into when addressing the other person with a different skin color compare to yours. No one has the right not to be offended. NOBODY. ***True racial equality is when people can joke and verbally offend each other base on their skin color******. I don't cry foul when people say  I had a big nose or that I can't play the piano well, because these differences, though real, is mundane and trivial, which is exactly where racial differences should be heading towards in the future.*** You sir, had a backward, though well-intentioned, conception of racial equality. But you are the one who is racist sir. ",0,1324759370,null,0,false,0,c3awhaq,t3_np0bt,t1_c3awhaq,t1_c3aw8ph,1428071050,1,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,1

Bad management and central planing do not prove that nationalisation is a bad thing. Granted, unions ran it into the ground and that had to be fixed. But rather than blaming nationalisation, why not blame bad management? Does a free market really make a product better? More information is needed if we are to accurately asses this point. 

An interesting side note would be : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rolls-Royce_Limited



""Indeed, the state never owned British Rail from the beginning - they only nationalised it after things started to go wrong for the various railway companies in the 1940s. Telephones were not state owned from the beginning either - they were nationalised too.""

I would like to see them nationalised again. Employing the useful private sector reforms with a social and moral aspect implemented as well. These companies should be assessed and regulated at intervals and compared to the most efficient in the world and those models factored into and other reforms. The information is there to be used. This brings us back to leyland.

""You are aware that private contractors routinely handle maintenance and renewal even under the state owned, yet ""for profit"" ""private"" Network Rail? Let's be honest, things have not been peachy back under state ownership.
I don't appreciate the attempt at heart tugging with the ""ask the families of""

Jarvis dropped the ball massively. People died because of the lowest bidder. On the most expensive rail service in europe. This is the epitome of my point. Heart strings or not; the facts remain.

""The nice thing is that you don't have to be with BT if you don't want to. I live in a rural area and BT are not my internet provider, although I am with them for phone. As it happens BT is actually moving support back to the UK.""

Your reinforcing aspects of my point here if BT are moving call centres back here? Again, I would say good planning, pride, correct legislation and regulation - using aspects from public and private to best suit the UK at the time would be the best solution. 

""The National Grid is not responsible for that, unless you're a major power generator. They don't run the local electricity networks that connect homes and businesses to the actual National Grid. Like how the Highways Agency runs the motorways and A-roads and the local council runs the rest.""

Again, as an end user this is confusing, slow, infuriating and tedious. One company. One call. Get the job done. I need it for my business, which once serviced with better electricity, can employ more people generating greater wealth for the country. Rater than wasting days being mislead by a troop of the inept with regards to a very simple request. Now, at a guess you could turn around and say. ""Well in the old days it wouldn't have been any better"" to which I would answer. ""Progression, modernisation, forward facing policy would move to alter this"".

""I don't understand your point here - there is a cost to the labour and materials required to improve your supply and it isn't cheap. Why should everyone else pay for it, instead of those who want the improvement and will directly benefit from it?""

Kind of addressed in my previous point.

I guess we really need to address fundamentals and core beliefs. 

1. What do you see Britain as?
2. Are you a conservative or a libertarian?
3. What is your attitude towards the general population in terms of work ethic? I.e: If the dole blaggers were given a good job with real pay pride and social mobility would they still screw it up? *(on a side note there was an interesting TV show about british workers being a bit crap. I'l edit if I find it)

Like any broader political ideology, your core beliefs feature strongly in your allegiance. I, personally, am disenfranchised with the UK political system in its entirety. 

Looking forward to your reply.

Scenario 1. Let's assume JT is innocent. If you were accused and Anton Ferdinand did not say a word, wouldn't you want Anton Ferdinand to step out and say ""I didn't hear it"" or ""I was not aware"" and let the whole thing blow over. 


Scenario 2. Let's assume JT is guilty. If you really did say and is denying it, wouldn't you want Anton Ferdinand to talk it out with you? So you can apologize and say ""Look it was heat of the moment, I shouldn't have said ""black"" you're just a c***.""


Scenario 3. Again JT is guilty but he's denying it and have not made any contact with Anton Ferdinand. Wouldn't you want him to just point his finger based on 3rd person's account of the situation and say ""I heard from my teammates, JT called me ******""


All of these scenarios could've easily help the situation blow over regardless if JT is guilty or not.

And about trying classic, start like this:

First of all, watch the first one, An Unearthly Child (just part 1). You need to know where things started. And then watch Genesis of the Daleks.

I had tried to watch classic many times, failing with four different stories. Until I watched Genesis, then I began hopping all over classic. Now I've seen all of it and am onto the radio dramas. So watch Genesis, and then go chronological. Or you can try dabbling by watching the best of each Doctor, in which case...

**William Hartnell, first**- The beginnings of the series. It needs forgiveness as it's very slow, and the Doctor is kind of a jerk at first, but there are some stories I really like. The Aztecs. It's a historical. Something DW doesn't do anymore.

**Patrick Troughton, second** - Patrick Troughton is basically Matt Smith, but in the '60s. He's all silly/bumbly, but don't let that fool you, he kicks butt. His run is mostly missing thanks to the BBC but there are reconstructions. And they also suffer from '60s slowness. Watch: The Mind Robber. Tomb of the Cybermen. And if you can do reconstructions: Power of the Daleks. And the War Games last.

**Jon Pertwee, third**- A weird run as most stories are on Earth (for story reasons explained). You meet the Master. This is when things really start to modernize and feel like they were made in the 20th century. Spearhead from Space, his first story. Inferno starts a little slow but picks up when the Doctor ends up in an alternate universe where everyone is evil. Like that Star Trek story. The Time Warrior introduces the famous companion Sarah Jane. Curse of Peladon, The Three Doctors, Day of the Daleks and last Planet of the Spiders are also good.

**Tom Baker, fourth** The most famous run. This is when the writing enters a higher standard in Doctor Who. There are so many fantastic stories, and it's the run in which Genesis of the Daleks occurs. One of the most famous classic stories, and the one that got me into classic (above). So I say Genesis of the Daleks, Robots of Death, Face of Evil, Warrior's Gate, Deadly Assassin (for Time Lord history if anything), Horror of Fang Rock, Sunmakers, and of course lastly Logopolis.

**Peter Davison, fifth** -Earthshock, Castrovalva (2nd half picks up), Kinda, Snakedance, Mawdryn Undead, Terminus, and Enlightenment. And The Five Doctors, which is the 25th anniversary special. EDIT: wait, how could I forget Caves of Androzani?! The last 5th Doctor story.

**Colin Baker, sixth** - Just want to say, Colin got fired. Poor guy. His Doctor is a drastic change with the flamboyant technicolor dreamcoat and bombastic crazy personality. If you can get used to him, he cracks you up and makes you laugh. He's a bit abrasive but so is the first doctor. His best is easily Vengance on Varos and Attack of the Cybermen, and Revelation of the Daleks. And if you want to try Trial of a Timelord (which is an entire season) it's pretty good. The Vervoid one is the weakest story I think. The sixth is the most underappreciated and maybe disliked Doctor. People say his era is crap, so when I went into it I was worried but pleasantly surprised. Because his era is NOT crap, it's only got a couple real stinkers, like any run does.

**Sylvester McCoy, seventh**. Personally, my favorite Doctor. This is easy. Remembrance of the Daleks, The Curse of Fenric, The Greatest Show in the Galaxy, Battlefield. Good mention to The Happiness Patrol, Ghost Light, Silver Nemesis. This is the era where they really try some crazy radical stories.

The slow pacing and recapturing that this person mentions is really on applicable to the black and white days. I really like the third Doctor's run and I enjoyed all of classic Who. (I mean sure some of the early ones drove me nuts, but I still enjoyed it as a whole).

Basically, the show's been running so long that every rule they've ever made has already been broken, so don't sweat little inconsistencies.

We find the nuances of the New Doctor, and glimpses of the ones we grew to love. I think this is one of the major draws, and also what keeps it interesting to us. Much as we like each incarnation, and think that this one or the other is the best, eventually the character becomes stale, and the story line becomes formulaic, and predictable.

I used to have to recite the Pledge of Allegiance every morning at school. I grew up in a small town in the middle of a cornfield and was bombarded with the flag-waving, ""America, Fuck Yeah!"" mentality. It was just something that was done with little to no thought when you are young.

However, as I grew up and started learning about the rest of the world outside of my small town, I began to see both the great things about my country and its shortcomings. It's one of the benefits of getting an education and experiencing the world, I suppose. Some people never get that opportunity and thus are stuck thinking what they've always thought because they never learned anything different.

One thing I will say about patriotism. Despite all its ridiculousness, it is one thing that gives us Americans some common ground. We are a large country full of people from everywhere. And while those who don't live there may only read or hear about how the ""foreigners are stealing our jobs"" and this ""real American"" bullshit, hanging a flag off the front of your house and respecting the national anthem at events and such can go a long way in helping these ""fake Americans"" be accepted in an otherwise closed community.

At the end of the day, we are all Americans and for the most part, we are proud of the country we've built. Sure, we've done some fucked up shit over our short history, but we've done a lot of good too and I think that patriotism is an expression of the good things we've done. It's just too bad some people don't see the other side of it.

That said, I still fucking hate the flag overload and couldn't give a shit about the 4th of July - except the BBQ and apple pie, of course.",0,1324804430,null,0,false,0,c3b19hg,t3_noys9,t1_c3b19hg,t3_noys9,1428169193,5,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,5

true,DogBotherer,null,null,"&gt;Is english widely spoken there?

Fairly (in tourist areas at least) and increasingly.  Pronunciation often leaves something to be desired though...which is because:

&gt;Is vietnamese a hard language to learn?

Yes, it can be, it's much more alien than most European languages (Hungarian/Romanian/Finnish excepted maybe).  It's a tonal language (6 tones), so it sounds more like singing than speaking to many Western ears.  The tones and therefore the vowels are much more important than in English.  They struggle with our language because in English it's the consonants which matter, so they often miss out the beginnings and/or endings of words. Dog, dock and doll end up all sounding like ""do"" unless they've really mastered it.

&gt;Is it cheap to live there?

It was, increasingly it isn't though.  There are still many things which are much cheaper than the West, but the bargains are fewer and further between.  The town centre of Saigon costs as much as most town centres, in the provinces or countryside, things are better.",0,1324807750,null,0,false,0,c3b1gdv,t3_np2fz,t1_c3b1gdv,t1_c3axeai,1428073393,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

That's what continuity has generally been about (see seasons 1 and 2). 

Nathan's role was the leader of the group. He was always the alpha male. Decisive (albeit stupid and generally ignorant), assertive, unapologetic, confident, aggressive (both physically and sexually), willful, creative. Rudy is none of those things. When Rudy splits, we see his juxtaposed alpha and beta personas (the alpha jumps out of him when it's disgusted by his beta half). Unfortunately, even his alpha side is indecisive, apologetic, boorish (every 2 person scene with him is the same as every other with most action being resolved offscreen).

Yep and in the last minutes of 10th after he says goodbye to Rose saying that it will be a great year for her... you see him at his weakest and you simply cry with him all the way. In my case crying and about to pull my hair cause it was too difficult for me to accept this was it.  But then he goes and say .... 

The Doctor: [final line of the Tenth Doctor, just before he regenerates] I don't want to go. 

and I'm like... I DON'T WANT YOU TO GO EITHER!!!

I am like .... WTH!

The transition from 9th to 10th is more Heroic

The Doctor: I absorbed all the energy of the time vortex and no one's meant to do that. Every cell in my body's dying.
Rose Tyler: Can't you do something?
The Doctor: Yeah, I'm doing it now... Time Lords have this little trick, it's sort of a way of cheating death, except, it means I'm gonna change. And I'm not gonna see you again, not like this, not with this daft old face. And before I go...
Rose Tyler: Don't say that!
The Doctor: Rose, before I go I just wanna tell you - you were fantastic... absolutely fantastic... and d'you know what?
[Rose shakes her head]
The Doctor: So was I.
[they both smile at each other for the last time before he is engulfed in light]  

With 9th to 10th i was ready to see the next episode ASAP, from 10th to 11th, I even had a mourning period in which I didn't want to see anything else of Doctor Who.  

After the mourning period was over, I started seeing season 5 grumbling through every episode.  But I'll be honest, this last season specially, bit by bit, he won the spot as the doctor for me and now I can't wait for this year xmas special + this season and what we might find for the 50th Anniversay special.

It was refreshing that the Doctor didn't get all righteously angry at the humans who were melting the trees. In fact he didn't really have the chance to do anything much apart from mess around. 

After last year's epic Christmas special which literally jumped the shark, it was nice to calm things down a bit.

Thank the FSM they managed to avoid the cheesy ""power of love saves the day"" trope as exemplified in episodes such as Night Terrors and Closing Time.

The line about him not being able to feel things any more was both a callback to the scene where he is explaining to Amy why he needs companions and a set up for the final scene where he cries in happiness, proving that he can feel after all.

The first scene didn't really add anything and wasn't really well done. I couldn't maintain my suspension of disbelief when he was waving his screwdriver at explosions and swimming through a vacuum. It should have been cut and replaced by something simpler; its only purpose was to explain how he met the woman from Outnumbered.

The scene with Bill Bailey et al was pretty funny.

I think, however, that most shows, Doctor Who included, suffer a bit when you bring small kids into the mix. Not too terribly fond of Madge or her kids, and I sort of figured as soon as we see the father dying that he'll somehow be brought back by the end of the episode. 

There were some good lines, though, and the last scene makes the episode for me. I think that if you look at the episode as an especially kid-friendly one that mostly serves as a bridge to get the Doctor to go back to Amy and Rory and say 'oh, by the way, I didn't actually die' it's serviceable enough. 

I also wonder if River showed up at their xmas dinner, too. The bit about how they always set a place for the Doctor was nice. 

Runaway Bride is still my favorite xmas special.

The wikipedia page gets the details from a book which you can even buy on Amazon :) The book is called the 'Historia Brittonum'. The reliability of it is debatable as it was made in the 8th century, which is 100-200 years after the time of Arthur.

I used one skein of each color, (red heart brand), from Walmart and it finished it off quite nicely. However, the red heart brand yarn is slightly rough, if I were to do it over again, I would say go ahead and spring for a Slightly softer yarn. Also, I made mine quite wide, for the sake of  it being grand and awesome, but over a foot wide is just too wide. If anything, leave it under 50 stitches across. Closer to 40, 35 at the minimum. And I used a pair of size 10 needles, and paper clips on the side of my project to keep count of stitches on large blocks of the same color. Overall it was fairly inexpensive to get started.

The interesting thing I find is that the hill fort was excavated by archeologists in the 1950's. The archeologist, Dr. H. N. Savory apparently found fortifications that dated to the time of Vortigern and Arthur. He also found a pool of water under the hill in a cavern and a raised platform above it. All of this is described in the Historia Brittonum, so it lends some credence to the fact that the place was actually in active use at the time of Arthurs legend. Dinas Emrys stands for Fortress of Ambrosius. Ambrosius as many people know was a Latin/Roman name for Merlin.

All of this is on the wiki and this website here gives various links to archeology and Welsh heritage websites that explain in detail.

My favorite Doctor of all 11 is the seventh Doctor.

And take note that awesome Doctor doesn't mean awesome run. I think that tenth does emotion best, but can't do eccentric. The eleventh did the best eccentric and has more consistent writing but less emotion. The ninth Doctor, in my personal opinion, has the best personality but the worst run due to its shortness and writing quality and special effects.

But it's really of personal opinion. Most people go for 10, 11, and 4 because they're the ones people hear about. These three also have great writing in general- but so do all the Doctors.",0,1324862718,null,0,false,0,c3b60dm,t3_nqo0u,t1_c3b60dm,t3_nqo0u,1428075629,1,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,1

true,WhyAmINotStudying,null,null,"I think it was all of the forced references to iconic moments in movie history that kind of bugged me. 

I mean, sure, there were references to The Lion, The Witch, And The Wardrobe, with the magic box that walks into a winter-wonderland, but it started off almost like Empire Strikes Back, the mother in the episode had an Aliens moment where she was 'piloting' the robot-thingy like Sigourney Weaver... I know there were about a dozen other little references to other movies (Memphis Belle's magical plane survival, I guess), but what really killed me was the end:

The Doctor eats Christmas dinner with Rory and Amy... He never did that with anyone else and I still feel like his relationship with Rose was more powerful than the Rory/Amy/River stuff. Of course, *everyone* gets along with The Doctor in his 'new family', where Jackie and Mickey both fell a distant second to Rose in the Doctor's life.

I also think they should have let the father stay dead. Bringing him back only keeps everything in the realm of an ideal family unit, but leaving him dead would have meant so much to the young fans who have lost a parent at one point or another. There was an opportunity to do something great there and the copped out.

Of course, I absolutely adored every second of the episode, so take my explanations with a grain of salt, but I think the cynical side of myself certainly understands why some people didn't like the episode.

I also love that this really felt like it was an episode made for children to love. This is a wonderful show and the future of Doctor Who is in the hands of today's young fans. ",0,1324866744,null,0,false,0,c3b6i0r,t3_npoza,t1_c3b6i0r,t1_c3b4nb8,1428075852,10,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,10
