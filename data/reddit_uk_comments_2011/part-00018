So the second you purchased the relevant Harry Potter book, it's okay to tell you who died and on which page, because that's no longer a spoiler?  I mean, the book's already out at that point.

&gt; You seem so confident in your position.

No, I'm not.  All I'm saying is the titles shouldn't reveal recent plotlines.  How about some common sense?  Saying ""The Ponds,"" plural, in the title, when a very recent episode revealed that Rory's still alive, is probably on the wrong side of the spoiler line.

But even for classic episodes, why not avoid saying the plot in the title?  ""Question about Tomb of the Cybermen"" instead of saying who found what in the tomb.  Or ""Question about Davros' actions in Genesis of the Daleks"" instead of ""Why did Davros play both sides when he was already creating the Daleks?""

Say you only like the Lib Dems in this example. You leave it at that. Your vote now is worth less than a person who has listed more than one candidate. A critic could counter ""well, that's part of their democratic choice""- to only exercise one preference. But this means that fundamentally, one person's opinions matter more than another's- if one person wants one outcome and another person another outcome, they should not be obliged to vote for something they do not want in order to give their vote the same electoral weight.

&gt;I've just voted for the people I want to win, and against the guys I dont. Simples.

This is negative voting, which raises a whole new question far too long to bore Reddit with, which is ""Does anybody have the right to **negate** the choice of others?"" Should democracy be only a manifestation of positive freedoms, or should it also represent the opportunity to deny others of their choice? This is not a question that shall be asked in the course of this debate, but it is pertinent. You indeed raise this yourself in your excellent point, critiquing my dislike of people getting in: ""Av is more representative, and then people I disagree with might gain power"". If you endorse employing negative voting to keep someone else out, then surely by conclusion AV is *not* more representative.
Also, voting *against* the guys you don't want to win *is* tactical voting.



&gt;At the moment with FPTP I have to vote for their rival. I really wanted the greens to get elected and instead have been forced to vote for the tories. Under AV I vote first for the greens, I want them to win...

You can of course vote for them under FPTP- though their election is unlikely. Further to my earlier criticism of AV, and the one you best countered, although it increases the likelihood of smaller parties (of which the Greens represents the most progressive constituency) being elected, it is still unlikely. Merely increased. A far better system for the incorporation of smaller parties, and more democratically, would be PR. This is because under PR everybody votes for who they want, and the seats are divvied up according to voting %'s. In AV you still require a critical mass. However, the smaller parties shall gain their greater boost from tactical/negative voting in AV, thus the increased likelihood (although small) of minority parties entering parliament. This does not, however, mean that Av is ""more representative"" as you say, as AV, by being a multi-vote system, rather than representing a positive choice, represents a convoluted and diluted choice of votes. The effects of 'diluted' voting, where people make less of a connection between the cross in their box/es and the electoral outcome can be seen in things like the Eu parliament elections, where far right parties make great gains, as people fear the consequences of their protest vote far less.

Your argument for AV preventing tactical voting is predicated on a false assumption, which is that a vote in AV is reflected in the electoral outcome. It is not. It is subject to the same crisis as FPTP in this regard, which is that the winner-takes-all. In other words, there is still only one winner, one representative per constituency. If 40% of people put the tories 1st, 40% Labour and 20% Lib Dems, that would not translate into a chamber with the same proportions. It would depend on voter concentrations, and constituency boundaries, just like FPTP. There would still be only one person getting in, there will be front-runners for that position, and thus some people will vote to get someone in, and others to keep someone out. The thing about AV is that it in actual fact provides greater opportunity to exercise *negative* votes in this regard. If people really want to discuss a representative and positively democratic alternative to FPTP then PR should be the one on the table. When people on this thread discuss 'strong vs weak government' and 
so forth, they don't seem to realise that AV doesn't remove majority government- hence that's what parliament, with our current constitutional model, is offering us, as it would not require a change to the governmental system. If anything, it is a red herring or a cover up to put off any thought of true electoral or constitutional change for generations.

As for the ""nothing better to do"". I've had 3 real interactions with the police in the past 4 years. That break in. A situation where walking home I spotted someone breaking in through the roof of a house,  so I went 5 minutes out of my way to inform the police who subsequently did nothing despite the proximity. Then there was a situation where I was walking home from a night out and the police decided to spend 15 minutes harassing me for ID (phoning it in with their office as well) and searching me for drugs for god knows what reason before finally giving up seemingly pissed off that I had done utterly nothing wrong.

The police have something better to do but dealing with thieves puts them in harms way. Most police are glorified traffic wardens who will never be useful in dealing with the issues that the public cares about but are very good for harassing people over petty things.

The few officers who really do something good I have the greatest respect for but it is for them as individuals and it does not generally reflect on the office.

Personally I'd completely re-organise the British policing system. There'd be far fewer police and they'd ignore the petty stuff almost entirely. Each would be heavily trained, far more elite and expected to directly intervene in real situations rather than fishing for things they can fine people for. The currently much maligned CSOs would take over the petty stuff but they'd get far less funding than the real police. I'd generally look to move the country away from enforcement of petty offences anyway. Fines in particular would not go to the police. Any fines would go back to the central pot.

The problem isn't that these investigations and resulting prosecutions were carried out under political duress, the problem is that they weren't carried out beforehand, and no doubt this is due to the political climate where anyone who makes that much money gains a little immunity from the laws.

Let's do a quick breakdown for what it would cost for me commuting to work for a year:   

 - Car £1200 (cost: £6000 over 5 years)  
 - Insurance £1200 
 - Fuel £1000~ 
 - Parking (?) 
 - Tickets/Fines/Bridge Fees/Congestion Areas/etc (?) 
 - Maintenance/MOT/Repairs/etc (?)   

Point being is that driving would cost me at least £4000/year. And that is being slightly optimistic. Currently I pay under £1000/year to commute to work via public transport. Honestly don't know how anyone can afford to drive to work - particularly those people who have families to take care of!    

PS - Before someone suggests buying a cheaper car, I've done that maths. It comes out costing the same amount over five years. The insurance goes up to counter-balance the savings of a cheaper car.

Kyrgiakos - Good in the air, but poor on the ground, he gets found out far too often. Decent cover, but as I've been saying for a while now, if rumors of Per Mertesacker's availability are true, we need to do whatever we can to get him. That might push the Greek out the door.

N'gog - I've been defending him for a while now, based on the fact that we bought him as a cheap, 19-year-old prospect and he's been thrown in over his head. I've stopped defending him because I've seen 0 developments in his game in the 2+ years he's been with us. I can't see him becoming much better than he is now. 

Jovanovich - I'm with you, I wish he'd get more of a chance. Looks like it's too late for that now.

Aquilani - I'd welcome him back, but I don't know what's happening there. Despite people constantly screaming ""£20m flop!"" every time he;s mentioned, he played well for us (when fit) and has done the same for Juve, and as you point out, he cost much less up front - if he doesn't play for us again, most of that money will never become and issue for us. I read something a few days ago about how Dalglish has never really liked AA-style passers in his central midfield, so that might be a factor. I still think he can do the job for us.

Enrique - Again, good point that the media is missing - he might normally be worth £15m, but with a year left on his contract we can get him for half that. Not a bad option at all.

Bale - Can't see this one happening. 

Charlie Adam - Is he out of contract or does he just have a year left? Either way, could be good value for us, but I don't know if we'll want him as much as we did in January.  Solid investment, but he won't be in our starting 11 if we re-enforce. Could be decent back-up for Meireles/Gerrard.

Mertesacker - Again, aside from a good winger, he's a player we really, really need to get. Like Agger with proper legs, he's a good, solid centre back who can play the ball and he's young enough to be a long-term fixture in the team. 

Juan Mata - Another one I can't see happening, which is a shame because he's been one of my favorite players for years now.

But I absolutely agree that the law regarding cases like this needs to be seriously addressed.

I suppose another lesson is get everything in writing.

Went to Stirling University to study Animal Biology

4 years later I graduated and applied for lots of jobs in the field, I only got a 2:2 with no masters

Got none and kept looking

After a year I volunteered with a conservation charity

Applied for more jobs, got one doing exactly what I wanted to do (took a bit of patience)

That contract ran out and I became self employed

Applied for a few jobs, landed a dream career in Ecology. I started last month. A career which expects a 2:1 and a masters and I was never ever intending to get a masters because I was sick of studying

Your age

Your gender

How much you plan to drive (expressed in thousands of miles per year)

What car it is you're insuring

I've found the longer you've had your license, the better. My fiancee' had her license for a year then her premiums came right down. Obviously it's going to go up if you've had any driving convictions/accidents. Age-wise you should be fine, the ""risky"" age discrimination (and it is discrimination) ends at 25. You'll probably be penalised for being male though (hence why my premiums are ridiculous being between 18-25 and male). The amount you drive I suppose is based on the reasoning ""the more you drive, the more likely you are to be in an accident""...

What car you drive affects it based on engine size (and other factors), I guess because the larger the engine the more likely you are to get into an accident (yeah go figure)?

true,[deleted],null,null,"I agree, but I think the problems go deeper than that. Fundamentally the businesses will only hire people if it is profitable to do so, and when you have so many researchers, etc. it is no longer profitable to hire more. So you only shift the unemployment rather than really solving it.

I mean it's a pretty fundamental problem as more and more work is automated, there is less employment available, unless it is made more profitable itself (i.e. sweatshops in manufacturing). And I think that is what we will see more of, a drop in living conditions and wages as people struggle to find any employment they can, especially with immigration and outsourcing too.

It is pretty insane when you consider it though, I mean, automation should be something we welcome, as it can increase productivity and remove the need for human work, and yet instead it just results in unemployment which results in poverty and overwork as people have to compete to keep a wage, and with such high unemployment you can't complain about any wage or working conditions.

I mean, I think it'd be much better if we instead had a society where automation _was_ used for the benefit of all, and the relief of work on all. And so we could focus on ending the needless work which people are employed in which could be automated (i.e. sweatshops, till staff, etc.) and also the redundant labour from the need for advertising and competition. But reading books advocating the same thing over 100 years ago (i.e. [_The Ragged Trousered Philanthropists_](http://www.gutenberg.org/files/3608/3608-h/3608-h.htm) and [_Looking Backward from 2000 to 1887_](http://www.gutenberg.org/files/624/624-h/624-h.htm)) makes me pretty skeptical that anything will ever change, we'll probably just accept the loss in living conditions.

Also while the credit crunch is only a ""short-term"" problem (if you call almost a decade ""short-term""), it will happen again, more or less severely, just as it has done before. And there are many arguments that it is this increasing unemployment and wealth inequality that produces it, as Einstein argued in [_Thoughts On The World Economic Crisis_](http://www.marxistoutlook.com/article19.htm).",0,1302703519,null,0,false,0,c1p6zas,t3_goy92,t1_c1p6zas,t1_c1p6x7u,1427062997,6,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,6

bojan - i could see a season long loan happening if he wants to get some 1st team action on a more regular basis.

others- arda turan/ eljero elia / matt jarvis

Enrique - most likely

others: coentrao/cissohko

Other names I've heard:
Afellay -just signed with barca but I could see him really wanting to move on to continue growing.

LB:

Coentrao even though he's so expensive

I'll settle for Enrique.

Winger:

Turan - would probably be pricey, but he's shown a lot of class and he's been playing with a liverpool boy at Galatasaray!

Mata - One of my favourite players. I think he's the player I want to see come to Merseyside most of all. Would probably cost a hefty amount.

Midfield:

Adam - a really solid back up to Stevie and Raul

Sahin - Young and already shows promise. I can't see him costing any less than the previously listed targets, especially as it looks Dortmund are poised to win the league.

CB - Not a priority imo, but if Mertesacker is an option DEAR GOD sign him. He's got the potential to be a legend wherever he goes.

GK - sad to say I think we need one. Think Reina wants out so

Akinfeev - ? youngish and arguably one of the best keepers in the world. I can see him being poached from Russia

otherwise I got no idea for keepers : /

So it's basically about ensuring that all votes are given proportional representation (thus the name), rather than just the majority votes. So it puts an end to the phenomenon of ""wasted votes"" - where if you voted for a losing party in your constituency, you may as well have stayed at home, for you would gain just as little representation.

The front 'poof' you'll almost want to put straight up to give it volume, but then you'll just have to let it fall forward on it's own. Sideburns are a definite must and spectacles complete the look.

Streamline yourself as much as possible. Another exercise you can practice is to cut every single non essential expense maybe for a month. This takes a lot of self control. But the point is not to save money, its to see opportunities to exploit. Waste is everywhere, but its difficult to see. Make notes of all ideas for other ventures. Go into as much detail as you can stomach of taxation. Develop an understanding of finance, health &amp; safety, and banking. All the grey boring shit you never bothered to learn. All the information is readily available. Make sure you are fully conversant with Word, Excell and Access. So you can produce reports and letters with skill. (As a side note make a decent CV and keep revising it. Its a good idea to have several different types, get Resume Wizard by heartbug, TPB). Work for yourself in everything you do, never do anything for anyone without some kind of remuneration. Its not about the money. Its all about a conscientious business attitude.

It does vary between colleges though, and at Girton there were enough reasonable people to make a few good friends. There's definitely a north/south divide too with the vast majority of people not from a private school being from the south end of the country.

Other reasons - the 8 week terms are a ridiculous idea for science courses, and are a remnant of the traditional system that should have been changed long ago. Studying Veterinary Medicine, I found the course way too academic for what should be a mostly practical course with a fair background in science. The Tripos system of exams, particularly in the amount of essays, is inappropriate for some of the modules I studied. And at the end of the day, Cambridge veterinary graduates are seen as less capable as working as vets than any other UK school. Hindsight's a wonderful thing, but when I only got an offer for Vet Med from Cambridge, I should have taken a year out to reapply.

That should not be the case, all my friends at universities like Leeds really like university, and I realised that I was basically missing out on the best years of my life. That said, enjoy your time at Cambridge, a lot of people do.

Then again, maybe you'd call me a posh twat. 

Personally I loved the outrageous 8 week terms (although the terms are longer in the final three clinical years), and I loved the extra academia of the veterinary course (as compared to the other vet colleges). A vet gets a whole life time of doing boring practical stuff, you might as well get exposed to the cutting edge academia whilst you can. Furthermore, if one wants to do post-graduate veterinary qualifications the study and academia required goes up exponentially anyway, it's something to get used to! The extra letters after your name don't come easily whichever university you qualify from (not that I'm capable of a diploma, so what would I know?!).

&gt; And at the end of the day, Cambridge veterinary graduates are seen as less capable as working as vets than any other UK school.

Of course, a few years of actual work as a vet down the line, it can't make much difference.

Going back to do work experience after I dropped out, the one Cambridge vet told me that in hindsight he would have gone somewhere else. He was a great vet anyway.

For me another 5 years in Cambridge wasn't going to work out. But yeah, the vets are a great bunch, and I'd certainly have left sooner if not.

The takeover was immediately followed by a flurry of bids for high profile players; the club broke the British transfer record by signing Brazilian international Robinho from Real Madrid for £32.5 million.[27] City finished tenth, and also reached the quarter-finals of the UEFA Cup. During the summer of 2009 the club took transfer spending to an unprecedented level, with an outlay of over £100 million on players Gareth Barry, Roque Santa Cruz, Kolo Touré, Emmanuel Adebayor, Carlos Tévez and Joleon Lescott.[28]

From wikipedia.

Man City got a massive cash infusion, and used that money to spend insane amounts on superstars from around the world.  Fortunately, it has only had mixed results, it seems like it's a bunch of individual superstars and not a team yet, so they've only had limited success.

Wikipedia has a lot of information on the EPL.  If you read about the clubs, you can follow up links to the current players, the former players, etc.  The tone of the articles is fairly neutral (i.e. the information on Fernando Torres is all factual) but it does give you some insight into what's going on.

And for some people, particularly over the course of years, it can become quite pathological and debilitating - to the point of a fairly generalised social anxiety complex.  But even before or without getting to that stage, not everyone finds it easy to casually strike up conversations, particularly when they invest them with undue importance, and I think that last point is critical.  You have to practice small talk to be any good at it, and if it's something you rarely try and consequently fuck up, then it becomes a vicious cycle/circle.  The only solution is to talk to as many people as you can in inconsequential ways without appearing like a madman/woman.  Makes for a friendlier world too.

Ramires/Mikel (CM/holding midfield) will hold down the midfield in the future and both have shown they're quality, and Essien has a few years left. van Aanholt will replace Ashley Cole in a few years.

Except, River dies. Wouldn't she regenerate in Forest of the Dead were that the case? 

And keep in mind the BBC has already stated that the Doctor no longer has a regeneration limit. If River were a Time Lady then she'd probably also no longer have one, owing to the fact the Time Lord are all gone. Which means the limit should be gone as well so she'd be able to regenerate, unless some arbitrary plot device were used to explain how the Doctor wouldn't have one but she would.

I think the answer's going to be the obvious. River is Amy. Amy kills Rory and that's how she becomes River. Hell have it happen with the Ood and you can get a nice random use of the lastname Song. 

Personally I hope that's not what happens. I'd rather find out something random like River is Amy and Rory's daughter, lost in time until the Doctor finds her with Rory and Amy tagging along.

true,[deleted],null,null,"Old Doctor Who is an extreme yawn fest when compared to the pacing of new Who. There are some really well written stories. An example of good writing is found in the Key To Time serials. Basically Season 16 of the old Doctor. It features Tom Baker who a lot of people consider the definitive old Who series Doctor. Douglas Adams, a brilliant author (he of Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy fame), wrote an entire section of the Key to Time serial called 'The Pirate Planet', and was the script editor (and thus a primary writer for unfinished sections of the Key to Time serials as well as piecing together parts of the stories so they intersected.) But as great as the writing is, rewatching them is tedious because:

* a. The serials are about 25 minutes. While this isn't so bad:

* b. Each episode is preceded with the 1:00 long intro theme

* c. Each episode after the initial first part begins with 1:00 to 1:30 of replaying the end of the previous episode to remind you where you left off.

* d. Each episode ends with a 1:00 outro.

So this all means that one 25 minute episode has minimally 3-4 minutes you have to keep fast forwarding through. Bringing the episode length to about 21-22 minutes. Sometimes less! That said you also have to deal with shoddy production quality, extremely dated special effects and the pacing elements I mentioned before. One four part serial (technically ""100 minutes"" long) could easily be trimmed down to a 20 minute decent mini-episode by a reasonable fan with the ability to edit video.

There was an article a number of months back from [the Guardian](http://www.guardian.co.uk/tv-and-radio/2010/oct/12/doctor-who-immortal-reveals-bbc) about this. In it they reveal a future episode of the DW spin off 'The Sarah Jane Adventures' where the 11th Doctor says there is no limit.

Not having really watched the scene I went and found it online. In the scene, which is admittedly a bit humorous, the Doctor's asked if he's always white and if there is a regeneration limit. He says no to skin tone and 507 to a regeneration limit. [link](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9D-2HJMD9s)

So at this point it could be considered non cannon, since it didn't occur in the show proper. It could also have been a humorous bit intended as an easy out if the BBC does abandon the 13 regen limit. Either way it was technically stated, but in a dubious way.

(Of course there's also the theory that the regeneration limit was a legal thing, imposed by the Time Lords. With them gone the rule could also in theory not be enforced.)",0,1302761364,null,0,true,0,c1pc9vj,t3_gpl0l,t1_c1pc9vj,t1_c1pc5dc,1427065617,2,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,2

She had the power of the vortex running right through her head, but it wasn't just that. The TARDIS is slightly psychic, and I think an element of the TARDIS might have been in there too.  
 
Anyway, the TARDIS is the bit that was doing the work, but it was Rose's mind giving it instructions. Rose basically said ""Make Jack Live"" but due to the nature of all the Wibbly-Wobbly Timey Wimey stuff that goes intot he universe, the TARDIS had to FIX Jack into the time stream in order to carry out the request.  
  
At some point, Jack no longer is Jack, but is instead the Face of Boe. This may be a natural mutation that ALL 5-billion year old Humans would eventually experience, but I think it may have more to do with Jack continually dying and Coming back to Life. In one episode of Torchwood, he is completely blown apart, only to regenerate from small traces of his body to a complete 'Jack'.

If he had this happen to him more than once, maybe the process is a little like a Photo-Copier - the image gets more degraded for each copy. The Face of Boe is what he becomes after a few too many near-deaths.

More likely is that while automation renders some jobs obsolete, it also creates newer ones: cars rendered buggy-drivers and horse-tenders almost obsolete, but only by *creating* the roles of chauffeur, driving instructor, mechanic, automotive designer, production-line worker and the like.

Computers rendered human ""computing clerks"" obsolete, but only by creating the roles of programmer, engineer, software architect, computer operator and data-entry clerk... not to mention computer repairman, computer shop owner (and staff), computer production-line worker, and all the trades that *use* computers that they enabled (everything from hedge-fund manager to adwords-supported blogger).

It's very obvious to us when people are made redundant due to technology, because it stings and we notice it and it happens comparatively quickly and these people make a lot of noise.  The opportunities *created* by technology are often less obvious, because they take longer to emerge, and we have to invent or discover them piecemeal, and while people bitch about ""bloody machines taking their job"" that rarely credit ""wonderful machines *making their job possible at all*"".

King Hubbert's [_Man Hours and Distribution_](http://www.scribd.com/doc/22289589/Man-Hours-and-Distribution-M-King-Hubbert) gives some (now dated) statistics, and [_The Zeitgeist Movement Orientation Guide_](http://www.thezeitgeistmovement.com/The%20Zeitgeist%20Movement.pdf) provides a few new ones (note that I don't particularly agree with either of these groups though).

&gt;More likely is that while automation renders some jobs obsolete, it creates newer ones: cars rendered buggy-drivers and horse-tenders almost obsolete, but only by creating the roles of chauffeur, driving instructor, mechanic, automotive designer, production-line worker and the like.

But if the role of automation is to relieve human labour, then the new jobs will never provide as much employment in proportion with the labour made redundant.

Unemployment hasn't risen to absurd standards (although 20% youth unemployment is high) because people need employment to survive, and so instead the government funds makework to employ people, and people are kept on in work that otherwise could be automated (i.e. shop workers, etc.) as it is cheaper to use cheap labour than to automate it. Of course the new technology does create some jobs, but these are often skilled and so for many are not accessible (especially when people must fund their own education).

I should be clear that I fully support automation and technology though, if it were possible we should aim to automate the entirety of human employment. The problem is the economic system that means this creates unemployment rather than sharing the products produced and relieving the work on all people.

I mean surely you can see that it would be better for society if we educated, trained and employed the unemployed and underemployed in areas where they are truly required? This would increase society's production and help provide more wealth for all.

I'd also add that the Luddites were not against the technology itself, but the way that it was used to drive down wages and living conditions for workers. Perhaps they too recognised that it would be better for all if rather than destroying the machines, they could take control of them and share their products so that no-one need be left to poverty and unemployment nor endless menial labour.

From the 1930s, which were coincidentally *also* [slap bang in the middle of a time of economic scarcity](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Depression).  The point is that if technology reduces employment there should have been a general upward trend in unemployment *since then* (in fact, arguably ""since any point in history since the Industrial Revolution""), and the figures just don't bear this out.

At best you can point to ""well I reckon..."" hypothetical scenarios that ignore half the issue, or point to examples from history that were quite clearly caused by purely economic factors rather than technological ones, even if people *at that time* were also busy blaming technology and making *exactly the same predictions of impending disaster* that you're still making now, most of a century later, with no disaster yet and none realistically in sight.

For reference, here's [a graph of estimated unemployment rates from 1890 to 2009](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:US_Unemployment_1890-2009.gif).  You'll note that there's *zero* upward trend in evidence (which, as technology and automation has increased all this time is what you'd expect if technology generally caused unemployment).

There are, however, marked spikes around 1930 (shortly before the source you cited above), and 2009 (the latest figures, basically the time we're discussing now, where you're making the same argument), along with a couple of others we don't have any evidence from.

From this I would claim there's zero empirical evidence that technology and increasing automation cause unemployment beyond small, *temporary* dislocations... but at times of economic difficulty, people come crawling out of the woodwork to *blame* technology for the plight of the economy, rather than face the fact that bad governance, irresponsible borrowing/lending or our entire economic system are at fault.

I hate to be dismissive, but I see your vague, hand-wavy and apocalyptic hand-wringing and raise you *hard, empirical historical evidence* which proves it's bunk.  And (bonus points!), as your first source demonstrates it's *exactly the same kind of bunk* that people were engaging in and using to wrongly predict impending disaster 80 years ago. ;-)

&gt; I mean surely you can see that it would be better for society if we educated, trained and employed the unemployed and underemployed in areas where they are truly required? This would increase society's production and help provide more wealth for all.

Of course - that's what I'm arguing.  Stop churning out janitors and start churning out janitorial-robot managers.  Stop churning out shop assistants and start churning out people who can write website content and manage automated stock-dispatching systems.  Stop churning out warehousemen and start churning out people who can oversee automated warehousing systems.

And (although it's not possible or sensible for everybody), start churning out more people who can build and write these systems, so that they become more common, they drop in price and more (and smaller) businesses can experience the benefits of increased automation and efficiency (and economies of scale) they bring that the big players have been enjoying for years now.  That means more profit, which means more expansion and *more jobs*.

It's easy to demolish the ""technology = unemployment"" claim, but harder to demonstrate the ""technology = more jobs"" one.  However, I'd invite you to look at the mid-90s, when the web (one of the most powerful and disruptive technologies ever invented by man) first started to hit the mainstream.

The first couple of years of the 1990s saw unemployment rising, then starting at around [the middle of 1993](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_World_Wide_Web#1992.E2.80.931995:_Growth_of_the_WWW) the unemployment rate reverses direction and takes a nosedive, all the way until 2000, when *bad investment decisions* (again: not technology) caused the dot-com bubble to burst and started an upswing in unemployment again (after which, once again, unemployment starts dropping again until the present credit crunch (also the fault of bad investment decisions, and not the fault of technology).

What this part of the graph shows is a trend of unemployment on the rise, and the introduction of a single new technology *reversing the entire trend, across an entire country, for over a decade*, and even quickly ameliorating the worst effects of a market crash.  One technology, on its own, reverses an entire socioeconomic trend for the better.  And that's fucking *incredible*.

True, this is more meagre evidence than the evidence that shot down your ""technology == unemployment"" claim, but it's still *highly* suggestive.

TL;DR: There appears to be no significant correlation between technology and unemployment, beyond (undemonstrated, but agreed) constant, trivial and *short-term* dislocations caused by disruptive technologies entering established industries.  However, there *does* appear to be some weak correlation between times of economic stress and people unfairly *blaming* their ills on technology.",0,1302774779,null,0,true,0,c1pcv0f,t3_goy92,t1_c1pcv0f,t1_c1pcri1,1427065893,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

Clearly automation does not simply result in us all being unemployed -for that would not be sustainable at all. If you read the sources in depth, you'd see that the real issue they are talking about is that it can often be more profitable to just use cheap labour rather than automating the work, and so we get this great waste of human potential in needless labour.

So instead it acts to drive down the purchasing power of the majority, as it acts to reduce the demand for labour (for whilst it does create new work, this is often in lesser proportion and is skilled work which takes time and money to train for, etc.) meanwhile outsourcing and immigration are increasing the supply of labour. This drop in the purchasing power eventually causes major recessions, as the masses can no longer afford to purchase the goods and services being produced at profitable prices, and so the businesses must make redundancies, etc. which worsens the crisis - I covered this idea a bit [in this comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ghrrm/iama_rich_man_ama/c1nnhbl?context=3). Of course, whether the majority of the current erosion of purchasing power and standards of living is up to the growth of China and outsourcing, the growth of the EU and immigration or automation is up to debate.

So it is not so much some doom-bringing prophesy of unemployment that is the concern, but simply the insanity of automation not being used for the benefit of all people, and the great waste of human potential in underemployment and unemployment.

&gt;Of course - that's what I'm arguing. Stop churning out janitors and start churning out janitorial-robot managers. Stop churning out shop assistants and start churning out people who can write website content and manage automated stock-dispatching systems. Stop churning out warehousemen and start churning out people who can oversee automated warehousing systems.

Well, I agree here, but eventually we will just have too many people to fill these jobs. I mean already people are saying we need more scientists, and yet there are nowhere near enough positions in the field for the current graduates. There's no natural law that means it will be profitable to employ everyone, even though this might be best for society's production.

&gt;However, there does appear to be some weak correlation between times of economic stress and people unfairly blaming their ills on technology.

I should make it clear again, that no-one is really blaming technology, but rather the economic system that turns its blessings in to curses.

It just seems like science (especially physical sciences) involve a lot of hard study for a small chance of a secure career which isn't paid very much in any case. I think it is something like 9% of PhD students in Physics (it might have been astrophysics in particular) get a  permanent academic job in their field and a huge number end up leaving science altogether - having to deal with the opportunity cost of spending years studying some esoteric area of science which they won't ever use although obviously there are transferable skills like mathematical aptitude and programming.

What is sickeningly funny is that it is the very people who have supported multi-culturalism along with high net-immigration that are DIRECTLY responsible for the growing intolerance in British society.

What is worse is that they exhibit ZERO self-awareness and no ability to empathise, traits that would allow them to appreciate that they are not typical, and that their actions are antithetical to a large part of British society.

If these idiots are truly comitted to seeing greater tolerance of ethnic minorities, and a reduced racism at the extreme margins of politics, then they need to IMMEDIATELY quite their self-destructive harping about diversity and support a reduction in immigration along with a renewed emphasis in assimilation.

He makes a point of this:
&gt; The main debate has focused around three areas: issues of security, the preservation of 'French values', and of course the oppression of women.

But then goes off on one saying how the figure of 2,000 women wearing the burqa is based on data. To me the actual number doesn't make a difference. If a law can be brought in to stop people from covering their face for security purposes (the law includes masks, balaclava's etc. too, not just burqas), help just one oppressed female and help her integrate into the country and community she is meant to be part of, then I think it's a worth while law.

He goes into a bit more detail around security issues about how the women who wear burqas aren't caught up in crime gangs, but if it was seen as a viable way to hide ones identity what's to stop other people from wearing them? I'm sure the designer of the balaclava didn't think ""Ah, this is perfect for robbing someone"", but was more likely to think ""This should keep me warm in winter!"" and yet they are still used to this day to hide peoples identity when committing acts of dubious legality.

He then sums up not by criticising the new law, but more criticising the steps that muslim families will now go to in hiding their females away, and that's a whole new kettle of fish that is harder to remove the ingrained cultural bias against women (in that they belong to their husbands etc.)",0,1302790596,null,0,false,0,c1pdlve,t3_gpvy0,t1_c1pdlve,t1_c1pdhgj,1427066245,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

There's some real jeopardy to the future of The Doctor and lots or disparate loose ends, which can be tied up and dealt with in a dramatic meaningful way. 


If he’s immortal, then the Universe would be full of Doctors. If he has 507 regenerations then that satisfies the continuation of the series nicely but loses the dramatic punch. If he regenerates to his 13th incarnation, dies, then comes back as a result of some collusion of things we haven’t yet realised or noticed (but established and planned out by RTD et al since the show’s return) then that would indeed be a master stroke. I imagine that’s what’s happening… all planned out in advance. The RTD masterplan.


Consider: some set of events combining Jack’s longevity, River’s knowledge, Rose and the Bad Wolf, Donna and her meta crisis, with a bit of Rassilon and the unnamed woman from End of Time… maybe also The Valeyard and The Dream Lord, Amy remembering, all these things may somehow combine to reveal something of the nature The Doctor having many more lives.

****  

GK:  

Sign a dependable backup keeper. Sell Turnbull, Hilario may still be useful. At least he's shown he can have a good game or two, Turnbull hasn't put in a confident performance in a Chelsea shirt, ever.

****  

Centre backs:  

No change. Go forward with Terry, Luiz and Alex. Ivanovic can deputize if needed, but push him to RB.

****  

Side backs:   

Sign van der Wiel, as long as he looks good defensively. Sell Bosingwa, too injury prone and defensively suspect. If there's a good offer for Ferreira, take it, but he probably doesn't cost that much, and a veteran presence isn't that bad. Performed well against Spurs and kept Bale quiet.

****  

Midfield:   

Ramires, Essien and Mikel should hold down two out of the three midfield roles, the defensive and all-action ones. Lampard and Benayoun should occupy the third, although buying a third option may be ideal. Loan out McEachran. Next year could be turbulent, so a stable loan spell at a lower club may take the pressure and spotlight off of him and give him more playing time.

****  

Forwards:  

Drogba and Torres can take the CF role. Sell Anelka, to be replace by Sturridge and Kalou on the right side. Zhirkov is still good as a depth player, but if he wants more playing time, we'll be forced to sell. Require a left sided, creative player with pace.

Depends. Lately he has been, but typically he's lined up slightly below Lampard, but above the third midfielder (was usually Ballack, Mikel, Ramires). I think he's been playing a bit of holding midfield now.

&gt; I wouldn't be opposed to a Robben return

I would. If he was getting hurt consistently at Madrid and Bayern, he doesn't have much hope in the EPL, and we saw that towards the end of his first spell. Teams like Stoke and Sunderland will ruin him.

&gt; Lamps and Drogba are great players but they are old, as much as I will hate to see them go their time is coming fast.

Both still have a lot to give, and are amongst the top players at their position. They do need replacements but McEachran and Piazon are capable of filling Lampard's role, Torres and Sturrdige might be able to replace Drogba, or possibly Neymar/Aguero.",0,1302805516,null,0,false,0,c1pf3yf,t3_gpvqc,t1_c1pf3yf,t1_c1peyls,1427066954,2,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,2

IN: A cheap, competent backup in case Cech goes down with injury. Turnbull always looks shaky and Hilario is Hilario. 

OUT: Hilario or Turnbull. May as well keep one around as third string.  

Defenders
IN: A defensively competent backup for Ashley Cole (he never gets a rest). If Bosingwa leaves we will also need a second choice RB assuming Ivanovich is starting. 

OUT: Alex may want to leave if he seems himself behind Terry and David Luiz permanently. I would love for him to stick around so that we have depth at the position but I would understand if he wanted to move on. 


Midfield: 

IN: Wingers. Someone that can play a good through ball and a good cross. Our strikers are not getting good enough service from the midfield. We've been able to punt the ball up the field to Drogba for too long. I would like to see us make a signing that can fill in for Ramires or Lampard. Paizon will be coming in in January to give us another option. 

OUT: Zhirkov. He has had some good moments but I think he will leave for consistent first team football. 

Forwards: 

OUT: Anelka, Malouda, Kalou (wants to move on).

It can be used for that, but like Daiz said, I don't want to spend 5 minutes of an episode watching the Doctor find his way through a locked door, and they can always write that the door isn't locked instead of having him sonic it. It's just more fun when he sneaks in though where he isn't supposed to be, ""sonicing and entering"". 

Take the episode with the cat nurses and all those sick patients. The doctor remembers the decontamination shower he was in earlier, and that he can use it to his advantage to cure all the sick patients. So, what does he do with it? [He takes a bunch of I.V. bags that were being used on the non-experimental patients and dumps them all together in the water tank used for the decontamination sprayer.  Everyone gets sprayed and is instantly cured.](/spoiler) There was no use of the sonic involved, though to be honest, I wish the writer had used it, even if the Sonic would have shouldered much of the blame. At least give us a wibbly wobbly hand wavey reason that mixing all these things together worked.  Throw in some technobabble about how some aspect of the sonic excites all the molecules into working together, or something like that.  There is one aspect of it that at least worked.  The test patients he was curing were given diseases to develop the cures in those I.V. bags, so at least they may have been targeted for the specific diseases the people had, but still it seemed a bit of odd writing, sans sonic.

Do we need to forget floating glowy Doctor, that happened sans sonic too if I remember. 

There has been some abuse of the sonic. In the waters of mars, the Doctor uses it to speed up that little robot so he can escape the water-logged zombies. Without the sonic though, he would have still survived. The writers would have just had him run and make a narrow escape just in time, sans sonic and sans robot. 

I like to think that the sonic is best used, either creatively, as was the case with A Christmas Carol, or as a fix-all solve-all for resolution of boring conflicts, such as locked doors. 

Besides, would you rather have the Doctor tear open a circuit box, cross the conveniently color-coded red and blue wires and magically open the door, or would you rather he sonic it.  Both are easy outs, but the Sonic at least has that sort of fantasy plausibility. We know what it is capable of, and a high security, top secret facility locked door looks kind of stupid if it is as easy to bypass as doing something like crossing two wires together. The sonic is a fantasy device invented by an alien genius. It's not just useful, but it's stealthy in that it's sonic waves or whatever can solve the problem without alerting the audience's BS radar, at least most of the time. :)  An overly simple solution though like throwing a bunch of iv's together, or crossing two wires though is going to rate very high on the BS'ometer.

It is a country. It's the official name of that country. I'll just link to the wiki article supporting and explaining this [fact](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_of_Ireland#Etymology).

'Ireland' is so much it's name that in 1989 the Irish Supreme Court rejected an extradition warrant that used the name 'Republic of Ireland' saying:

*""If the courts of other countries seeking the assistance of this country are unwilling to give this State its constitutionally correct and internationally recognised name, then in my view, the warrants should be returned to such countries until they have been rectified.*

Not entirely, although someone still has to clean that shit up, and thus it could be seen as such. Although things like health and safety, evidence gathering and general modern policing would have prevented it, I think there might have been some millage in randomly selection 2 of the protesters to clean it up before anyone was allowed to go anywhere. 

&gt; UK Uncut piss me off a bit (I think we might have talked about this before), but I don't think we should be approaching them with this kind of zero tolerance attitude, where each minor offence is prosecuted to the maximum possible. Do you think that is the correct approach? Is this how we can expect minor protests to be dealt with from now on? I know you are not in favour of protest, because it is ineffective (I have watched that Barney Franks video), and I agree to an extent, but I still think that a free society must have room for protest, and those who protest should be treated fairly, not prosecuted beyond the reality of their actions.

There is room for protest, as the quarter to half a million people who protested that day demonstrated. We shouldn't pretend that just because the UK Uncut occupation people were arrested that the right to protest was jeopardized. And while I don't think protests alone do much, I don't think it should be banned or prevented, just that protesters need to be aware that there is more to protest than marching.

As for UK Uncut, I dislike their over-simplified arguments and commitment to a fairly limited remit but I don't see this as a reason to throw the book at them. However, they should be aware that given their choice of methods, they will run into legal problems sooner or later.

&gt; As far as I know, they are all only being charged with aggravated trespass, which seems seems fair enough, lets see what happens in court. Why are we perpetuating this myth that this was some kind of orgy of destruction by anarchists? When we are actually talking about some chalk slogans on walls.

The issue I take is with the stance that it was an entirely peaceful, polite protest with no damage being done at all, when there is clear photographic evidence that this was not the case along with some possibly apocryphal claims of petty theft. I don't think anyone, and certainly not myself is claiming that there was ""some kind of orgy of destruction by anarchists"".

You know in a pub or playground where people start by pushing each other, and it gets harder and harder shoving or striking before someone finally throws a full punch?  It is like the penultimate blow to the shoulder before someone actually clenches a fist and goes for the jaw.

That said - it wasn't a full force strike, but it was a strike none the less.  

[Palm strike](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_%28attack%29#Palm_Strike) is described here, it is a standard Police technique.  Often with a shout of ""get back"".

I want to clarify - just so there is no misrepresentation - This was a street leading toward the area where issues were happening.  The street was pretty much empty, shops and office workers at one end (normal life), office buildings down most of it, with a cordon of riot officers standing around part way down  facing away from the area where the protests were happening.  At the very far end of the street I think there was one of the junctions where the police were staged, and presumably that would have been near the edge of the protest itself.  The cordon was not in any 'active' sort of stance or engaged with any protesters - at the end of the street I was approaching from was normal life.

I (somewhat carefully) approached one of the officers, and asked for directions to get around the area.  I was obviously cautious to be non threatening, and was not in any way dressed like a protester.  The policeman didn't appear to see me as a threat - the conversation was fine, civil, perhaps a little dismissive from his side, but ok.  He advised me where I should go, it was just at the end as I've described.  I said thank you, started to step away, and (I can only guess) something went through his mind as though - hang on I'm a riot officer I'm supposed to be defending this line, not talking to people, and he shoved.

I'm ashamed to say I was so surprised, and I suppose since I was moving away anyway, I just gave a look of incomprehension and walked away rather than try to do anything about it.

The vast majority of cases never lead to society picking up the bill when losses become great and investors walk away.

The case of nuclear is a little special in that regard but it is not totally one sided.

It is as much the fault of the government for letting nuclear facilities operate without (sufficient) insurance as it is the fault of investors looking to make a quick buck and then bail.

In the past government did that because it wanted ostensibly civilian facilities to make material for weapons and because the new nature of the material and the imperfect nature and size of the insurance market meant (feel free to disagree) that government insurance of the facilities was the only viable option.

Today, you are right that they lack such excuses and society should not be picking up their bills.  But the answer is not to remove limited liability.

true,mcroft,english,Crinkley Bottom,"Did you read the second page from that article? I can't see any reference on the articles you posted, but the key point is this:


&gt;The UK has just 2,788 megawatts of pumped-storage capacity and it can run at that level for just five hours. UK national demand is above 40,000 megawatts for 15 hours a day and seldom drops below 27,000.


The articles you posted don't really address this - Like I say, the articles don't mention the contingency plans for the USA or the rest of the EU for when there is no wind. There's every chance that they have better pumped storage or pumped storage alternatives that meet demand.

the ""*reality*"" of the EU according to that article also seems a little hard to believe. I don't dispute that carbon emissions have reduced, or that that's a bad thing, but I'd like to see the full picture of energy production.

&gt;In 2009 Europe actually decommissioned more coal, nuclear and gas plants than it built.

I'd hope so. I wouldn't want to think that power plants aren't getting more efficient.

&gt;A whopping 61% of all new power generating capacity added in 2009 was renewable energy.  Of this, 39% of was wind power, followed by bio gas (26%) and solar photovoltaics (16%). Last year is the second year running that renewable energies have accounted for the majority of new investments, with wind power being the leader.

That's a lovely sound bite, but it's talking about *capacity*, and we already know that the general consensus is that a wind turbine will produce 30% of it's capacity during its life (less, if you believe the report cited by the Register)

I would like to see numbers on the amount of electricity generated by the new fossil/nuclear fuel plants and each new renewable plant. I would be very surprised to see that the 61% renewable capacity translates to actual energy produced.

If the data in the reports you've posted could be taken at face value, I would expect **no** new fossil/nuclear fuel power stations being built.",0,1302878856,null,0,false,0,c1pk860,t3_gqpby,t1_c1pk860,t1_c1pk3if,1427069448,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

So it is *possible* for them to acquire private, viable insurance.

Even without that, if there is no private insurer willing to take on the worst-possible risk at a price that is still profitable then that simply mean that nukes are not an economically viable option.

So I still say that the solution is to require proper insurance and if that is not economical, then simply not build the plants since they cannot be economically possible either.  The answer is not to punish millions of viable, safe, well run industries by removing limited liability.

They keep us warm and protect us from changing weather. However, on sunny days in some places (such as the beach) you can see that people almost entirely dispense with their clothes. In some designated public areas, clothes are not worn at all. It is sad that we need to have dedicated nudist places, but that (once again) stems from a puritanical, repressed approach to the human body.

&gt; how we imagine relationships, how we respect them, and how we aspire to have them.

How you aspire to have them, perhaps. Why should others not be able to express their relationships in public, in a way that harms no-one? Unless, of course, you are of the opinion that people exercising free expression (such as street preachers) has the ability to harm?

&gt; They should not be flaunted like a trophy in public

Why? Relationships come in many, many forms - and to intentionally limit yourself to this specific form that you describe seems to me to be completely bizarre. Have you never had an open relationship, a polygamous relationship, a bdsm relationship or other non-traditional relationship? If not, how do you suppose you have the depth of experience to talk about what a relationship is?

&gt; Having sex openly in public would shatter our aspirations to be together with one person.

How so? And why should a relationship be about being only with one person? There are many types of loving, sexual relationships that reject that idea of monogamy.

&gt; I just don't want to see a world in which it's ok to just start fucking someones brains out at the park while children are playing, it's completely ridiculous.

To you, perhaps. I still see no rational reason for this. Why is it ridiculous? Why is it even more ridiculous for children to see this? Why can we not have an adult, sensible and rational approach to something as vital to our species as the reproductive act? Why do we not all also have the same emotional 'ick' factor with regards to eating (which some people do, and it is considered a disorder)? 

What I am trying to do is get to the emotional basis for this so it can be examined. All you are doing is just dismiss any attempt to delve deeper into the origins of this perspective (sex as a personal thing) with a cry of 'that's just ridiculous' when provided with an alternative, or trying to couch things in terms of relationship roles / definitions that seem to hark from the 19th century.",0,1302890140,null,0,false,0,c1pld5e,t3_gqmy9,t1_c1pld5e,t1_c1pl9u1,1427069984,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

As far as sex being an act of love, it is no different from kissing or holding hands. Rationally, we cannot look on the reproductive organs as any different from lips, hands or any other part of the body. Sex is, therefore, no different from any other consensual human interaction.

Ultimately, though, it is a matter of freedom -  the perspective you espouse is that of trying to restrict people from expressing themselves in some way, therefore the onus is on you to prove it is harmful. That is the basis of social ethics within a free society.

It could be argued that, by ensuring sex is still a taboo, private matter, that it ensures that sexual urges are heightened through control and can be used to the best effect within the bedroom. However, that argument may no longer apply due to the preponderance of pornography. The unintended side effect of controlled sexuality is that some people with more violent urges and less self-control may choose to impose themselves on others, for example.

true,ajehals,eng-yorkshire,Sheffield,"&gt; Drug patenting is the number one thing holding back a viable private option for the masses, since they push the price of medical care through the roof.

The point that private healthcare is a bloody stupid idea is holding back the private option (private cover at present is dirt cheap in the UK because it's backed by the NHS....).  The moment you have a number of smaller discrete risk pools insurance gets silly and we start seeing people denied coverage (unless it's legislated against which sort of defeats the point of it being private...).

Hell, if you privatised the NHS tomorrow, you would have the same clinicians, administrators, buildings and kit being used in care provision, with a larger admin burden and a profit component being extracted, all with no guarantee of greater efficiency or better choice (due to cost and access constraints..).

I would suggest that there is almost no decent argument, in terms of health delivery or costs, for private healthcare provision and a market in healthcare is simply unfeasable due to the imbalance of power and the fact that people have no control (or very little control...) over what services they would need (hence the requirement for an insurance model and all that entails.",0,1302903863,null,0,false,0,c1pmpx0,t3_gqoce,t1_c1pmpx0,t1_c1plylj,1427070623,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

A few weeks ago I went to the Apple store to get my iPod fixed. The picture on it is a Dalek with ""Exterminate! Exterminate! Exterminate!"" The guy dealing with my iPod said he liked it, and I figured he was a fan and said I was excited about the new season coming out. He said, ""Oh, it's a show? About...robots?"" I told him it was a show about awesome.

I pulled that same iPod out at a meeting at work, and the head pastry chef saw the screen, laughed, and told me how much she and her husband love that show.

My friends know I love this show but none of them can be bothered to watch it. When I post stuff about it on Facebook there are usually four or five people I haven't laid eyes on in ten years who join in a discussion about it. 

When Matt Smith was on Craig Ferguson a while back, I was at a friend's house with two or three other people. None of them was impressed by it and a few said Smith was a weirdo and asked if he's that weird on the show. The guys all agreed Karen Gilliam was hot, but not really worth watching the show for.

&gt; NO move to a US-style health insurance system

This is ridiculously obvious. I don't think anybody has seriously accused the reform plans of introducing an insurance system. What they will do, however, is make the way *healthcare itself* is delivered more like the US, with hospitals and health facilities no longer run directly by NHS organisations, but instead by the private sector. 

I'm highly unconvinced that this is actually what people want or need. The DoH and NHS should be striving to make healthcare consistently good. No matter where in the country I fall ill, I should be able to receive high-quality treatment. The horrendous attempts by Labour to introduce choice into the NHS, and now this from the Tories, mean this will never happen. Indeed, they work to produce the exact opposite; as in the US, the burden will be on the patient to ensure they choose to go somewhere where the standard of treatment is high, rather than being guaranteed it.

   - Wind power on the many Downs - Ventnor, Bembridge, Freshwater, all great sites

   - Biomass/biogas...masterplanning the agricultural output of the Island to both create desirable local produce sustainably, by maximising the efficiency of resource flow - using local manure for local crops, water waste reuse etc and generate by-products that can be used to create fuels-  methane, fuel pellets, grain oil etc

   - Tidally driven wave power?

That's pretty vague, since the Criminal Law Act is pretty long-winded, however, I believe they mean Part II, Section 12A, subsection 6, [which is here](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1977/45/section/12A).

It seems...

&gt; he or a person acting on his behalf holds a written statement—

&gt; (i)which specifies his interest in the premises;

&gt; (ii)which states that he requires the premises for occupation as a residence for himself; and

&gt; (iii)with respect to which the requirements in subsection (3) below are fulfilled.

Is what they must rely on, but no mention of it is made in the article, so all I'm seeing here is a lawful entry. It's extremely unlikely so many officers would partake in unlawful entry as any evidence showing that they've done so would mean them losing their jobs and probably a criminal conviction.

Furthermore, if a police officer wanted to remove evidence, they'd invoke the PACE (Police and Criminal Evidence) act and just confiscate any material believed to hold evidence of a crime (even when committed by a fellow officer), then conveniently lose it or erase the specific content on it and hope that's the end of it. Destroying it in front of several witnesses would be much less effective, particularly if you didn't destroy it enough.

To me, it seems like the squatters are clutching at straws to stay where they are and fabricating whatever they can.

Do you really think that if we say yes there's going to be another referendum in our lifetime? All AV will do will strengthen the lib dems position a little (assuming that the electorate doesn't tell the lib dems to go fuck themselves, which I imagine come the next election is likely to happen, but it will probably be an equal shoeing all round for everyone). If there's a vote, whatever happens the government of the day (and successive governments for as long as possible) will say that we had our vote and made a democratic choice.

To put this into perspective, there's been no referendum on our status in the EU. Europhiles within the government say that the 1975 referendum was our vote on Europe, but this is disingenuous as it was a vote on the common market, not membership of the EU. That should've happened in 1992 but it didn't. It should have happened before Lisbon, but it didn't.

It's growing every year, though.  Last year (in Chicago, by the way), I saw a billboard ad for it on the CTA at maybe 2 or 3 stops.  Now, there's a DW billboard at almost EVERY stop.

There are two reasons why it's not bigger here:

1. It airs on BBC America.  To get BBC America, you have to have cable or satellite TV, and usually you have to pay for the higher-priced packages.  Most people don't do this, thus most people don't have BBC America.

2. The people that know of *Doctor Who* but don't watch it are aware that it's old, and that there are several decades of episodes.  Most people assume that you have to watch from the beginning (i.e., 1963's Season 1) and watch it all in order to know what's going on now, so they don't bother.

The best possible solution would be for Series 1-4 and the specials to be syndicated on a network, like ABC, NBC, CBS, whatever, and advertised a LOT.  Particularly, it needs to be advertised as being the BEGINNING of the series, so people don't think they need to watch the 26 seasons of classic stories before they jump into the Ninth Doctor.  At the same time, current episodes would continue to premiere on BBC America. 

The drawback would be that the general public would be several seasons behind.  But with the popularity of Netflix, if they liked what they saw, they could jump in and get caught up.

Hell, maybe eventually the network broadcasts could catch up with the current episodes, and they could start airing new episodes on a network simultaneously with the UK airdates.  This would mean they wouldn't air on BBC America anymore, but everyone in the US with a TV (well, with a TV that's connected to an antenna, cable, or satellite) would be able to see it.",0,1302991379,null,0,false,0,c1prum2,t3_grete,t1_c1prum2,t3_grete,1427073099,4,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,4

The Doctor, in general, doesn't do overt love interests, more fun that way imo). But, again, it's just a show. Then again, you came in a week old thread and got all defensive. I didn't go in old threads you posted in and try to force my like of I dunno, pick a Doctor Who character you don't like, on you. Anyway, I think the woman is unattractive and her character is undeservedly arrogant. However, my opinion isn't actually any more valid than yours, and I don't think I'm better than you. I generally cite how long I've been a fan for context, not to like, lord it over people. I mean really, most people don't get the show, certainly not the old stories I grew up with, so seriously, I'm not cool because of it or trying to imply that I am. Still doesn't mean I have to like every character or story line, even long arcs. But hey, I liked f#$king Trial of a Timelord, so what do I know? I don't like her, so I grouse about it on the internet, because I can. Sheesh. Oh, and Matt Smith = thumbs up! and most of season 31's writing was damn good.

My hope?  Doctor Clone (or John Smith, I guess) is a bit bitter at the Doctor for still being, well, the Doctor.  John loves Rose, and is glad he can live the sort of life where they can be on equal footing, but being human--with human-sized emotions, inferior intellect, and human pettiness--is wearing.

Upon meeting Eleven, the clone attempts to be condescending toward him, saying things like, ""Two-level TARDIS control room?  Oh, well, looks a tad bit, mmm, *crowded* now, don't you think?""  

And Eleven is all like, ""Oh, well, not every room needs to have you at the center of it!""  Laughs.  Goes back to work.

John Smith is all like &gt;:[ or, if he still wears glasses, &gt;B[

The Doctor and John's mounting tension builds up to a short scuffle in which the clone attempts to put Eleven into a headlock and then his arms behind his back, but is then kicked.  The clone is just a bit too skinny and Eleven is tall.  Rose tells them to knock it off and the clone steps back while Eleven tries to bite his hand.

Essentially, they're brothers.  Or very close cousins.

Also in my personal head canon, the clone's name is definitely John Smith and he's a substitute teacher because that's the career the Tenth Doctor showed an inclination toward (""School Reunion,"" ""Human Nature"").  Most of his students like him. He rarely keeps to lesson plans and butts heads with the administration. (""Well, of *course* we went to the roof to throw off watermelons!  We were studying *gravity.*"")

His relationship with Rose isn't perfect, but they get by.  A good deal of trouble arises, at first, when he feels like she's comparing him too much to the Doctor while she thinks he's obsessing too much about it.  She says that she fell in love with the Doctor's more human qualities and dealing with a man who's nearly a deity would have tired her out, eventually. Anyway, she often adds, she's with John, not *him.*  They also fight about grocery shopping, mortgages, bills, and the lawn.  

He loves her, though, and he's never brought up the fact she makes more money than him.  He also doesn't complain about Jackie the way the Doctor did.  When the whole family's over, he tends to dote on Rose's younger brother.  Rose at first thinks he's just trying to get in good with her but he really does like kids.

Castle, which airs on ABC (broadcast network for those not in the US), got just over 10 million viewers for the opening of it's 3rd season. That's a pretty good number--the fact that Doctor Who got 10% of that on a premium cable channel is very impressive.

Lost, which was a huge hit in the US, also had 10 million viewers for the opening of it's last season. 

Battlestar Galactica in it's last season had a viewership of about 1.5 million people. I believe that the Syfy channel is available in most basic cable packages. 

To compare to the Monday night headliner shows on the broadcast networks.

ABC's Dancing with the Stars got 22 million people on it's most recent premiere

NBC's Chuck opened with 7 million viewers in it's most recent season

CBS's Two and a Half Men opened with 14.5 million viewers. 

So basically Doctor Who is drawing between 10-15% of the viewership of the typical broadcast network show and about the same viewership as more ""mainstream"" science fiction shows.

There is no other lawful means to enter. NONE, everything else is unlawful entry.

And police will attend any incident in which they're called by other police. Typically they use escalation as a means to gain control, but when they do it as a means to bring more force to bear the initiating officer is a criminal. We do not live in a mob rule society no matter what uniform someone is wearing.

If an officer wanted to use PACE to seize evidence then he'd have to record it, if that fill later showed the officer was the criminal then the force would have to act on it or destroy the seizure record, a serious crime if detected. No officer will use PACE to incriminate himself, he would destroy evidence by snatching it and jumping on it, exactly as described.

To me it seems like a few authoritarian police officers are creating a record of incidents to later justify significant use of force, like armed police. it only takes a few, who like you seem to be bias against squatters, to create incidents.

It definitely isnt about theft because the energy/cost expended far exceeds the goods recovered/*future crime prevention*. Its about reenforcing the cardinal law of consumerism: 

&gt;""*Thall shalt not avoid consuming and thusly placing the economy, and ultimately, your masters wealth, at risk*""

This story is just the epitome of how fucking wasteful our civilisation is and how it despises reuse. 

For years, I've heard how supermarkets, once they learn of people skipdiving after they close, will pour bleach over everything to render it unusable. When I've asked reasons for this, they claim that their insurance doesn't cover them yet a simple sign by the bins stating that if people ""dive the skip"", they are fully responsible for anything that happens, should discharge them of any liability.

Sandwich shops would spoil their waste instead of giving it over to homeless shelters until they had a change of heart recently. (Apparently, Eat now donates wastage to charity).

Whilst we spend more time, effort and money on discouraging people from recycling (and the whole skillset that grows from it), we deserve to meet our demise, screaming from drowning in our own filth.

When the council sold the centre to a private company (May Gurney in my case), that's when the staff started to clamp down on it.

I suspect two reasons:

1. Compensation culture (fear of being sued)

2. Profit. Like the article, companies want to deter people from taking even small things. It's not just the profit they're missing out on, but by setting the police on them, it's using them as an example.",0,1303076076,null,0,false,0,c1pww3p,t3_gs0k7,t1_c1pww3p,t1_c1putax,1427075475,4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,4

It started on facebook, a friend of mine posted that he was eating squirty cream from the can and trying to finish it up that evening. This was about 8pm. When someone asked why, he said, and I am not making this up, because the Best Before date was the next day.
