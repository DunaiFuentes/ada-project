You are indeed correct again. Point taken. That said, the division lies in the fact that if you ask a person to do something they have a choice, if you tell a machine to do something which it is programmed to do, it has no choice. I suppose this also gets complicated with contracts for things which in theory restrict choice of action from a legal perspective.

&gt;I merely need to instruct a computer in order to commit a crime and I need only my voice to do so.

So what you're talking about is some hyperintelligent computer which just does whatever you tell it to do, and what I'm saying in response is that a computer which will kill anyone for you at your word and whim would be illegal due to the nature of what it's programmed to do (anything, instead of anything *except* mass murder etc.).

In other words, computers can not yet be agents. They must be programmed so far, and potentially forever. However if there reaches some point where they effectively program themselves or their future iterations to the level of sentience, then it would be the computer itself that became the moral agent in this case.

true,specofdust,scot-Highlands,Pasty Faced Haggis Rider,"&gt;I understand where you are coming from but if I ask someone to kill my wife and that person carries out the deed I think the vast majority of humanity would agree that I was complicit. The very act of asking is immoral.

That's the utilitarian perspective, but I reject utilitarianism as a moral system because I think it leads to the least worst outcome in all cases, as opposed to the fairest outcome. The vast majority of humans seem to follow some weird mixed up kantian/utilitarian/virtue ethics system mixed with a heavy dose of irrational emotion, this is why we need laws.

&gt;I merely provided you with an example where the speech effectively becomes the crime because the mechanism via which the act is achieved is merely a tool.

Right, but here's my thought. We should legislate against that which is immoral. There is nothing intrinsically wrong with uttering ""computer, kill"" or clicking a mouse in a certain way on a computer. The problem only arises when you violate the harm principle by using a mechanism, any mechanism, to carry out an act. It doesn't matter whether you use a computer, your voice, a carrier pidgeon, a complex series of levers. We do not prohibit any of these mechanisms because there is nothing wrong with them, we punish the act carried out via the mechanism (and probably should do, so long as it actually violates the harm principle).

Just because the mechanism by which an act is achieved is a tool does not mean we should ban it, rather we can prohibit the act without prohibiting the tool. Just as we don't need to prohibit the motion of pushing a knife back and forth in a forceful motion, because it's already a crime to cause someone grievous bodily harm. One is the mechanism by which the other is carried out, but only the latter need be banned, while the former need not (and should not) be leglislated against.

&gt;Guns don't kill people, people do etc.

Being shot kills people, guns are just the tool used to carry that act out. Hence why murder is illegal, and guns can (kind of) be legally owned (I won't get into gun prohibition because it'd engulf the discussion).",0,1319195468,null,0,false,0,c2t943a,t3_lf2me,t1_c2t943a,t1_c2t90ix,1427762258,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

Saddam was given a show trial and executed, all by his own people. In the case of the Nazi's, that was slightly different. Hitler killed himself, and when his people found him they burned the body in a ditch to prevent anyone else from getting their hands on it. What happened to his commanders and political leaders is probably what will happen to Gadaffis people, they will be tried and some of them will be executed. Benito Mussolini was executed by his own people without a trial, then they did [this](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Mussolini_e_Petacci_a_Piazzale_Loreto,_1945.jpg).

&gt; Fair enough on the sea burial, but, by doing so, they disposed of the evidence. As for the photos, as far as I know, only a handful of Americans have seen them. Perhaps they should be given to some independent, trusted third parties to (privately) verify the photos and footage. This would prevent it from becoming a trophy (although many have already made their own attempts).

He's dead. Even his own people say he is dead. What more is there to come from this, they tracked him down, went in, killed him, then disposed of the body after taking DNA and pictures. 

&gt; Can an organisation or an individual officially declare war on a country other than their own and vice versa?

true,specofdust,scot-Highlands,Pasty Faced Haggis Rider,"&gt;If one knows in advance that the tool they are using merely requires the utterance of a few simple instructions in order to commit an immoral act then the utterance of those instructions becomes an immoral act. Yes?

Well, as I've tried to explain I separate out the actual use of words from the act committed by the use of the language. You're talking about using language as a tool, just as we can use (basically) any input as a tool with devices. To my mind, to restrict freedom of speech is to say that there are certain words or phrases or sentences which are intrinsically wrong (for example, saying one hates blacks/jews/zombies/mormons). That is what happened in the case of Stephen Birrell. He publicly expressed that he wanted catholics to die.

To restrict language based upon its use as a tool is actually a really interesting thought experiment. I'd have to say though, that it is possible to seperate out the use of language as words and the use of a muscle which vibrates air as a tool here (one is conceptual, one is physical). It's intrinsic to what Mr. Birrell did that he used langauge to express something. It's not intrinsic to what you're suggesting that one would need to use language to commit that crime, one could use a mouse or a keyboard or any input method one would want.

So I suppose I maintain that I recognise a distinction between the mechanism and the act, if the mechanism is not a necessary requirement for the act.

To answer your question more specifically, would it be immoral to utter the instructions if say the instructions had a direct causal link with theft or murder, hmm. I would actually say yes, but maintain that this does not impact upon freedom of speech, as I would say that the reason it would be immoral is not because of what you are saying (or even that you are speaking, there is nothing intrinsically immoral about that), but because of the act you are triggering. Just as I would say it would be immoral to steal or kill by a system of levels, footsteps in the right direction, blinks of the eye monitored by a camera, and any number of other methods. I don't say that we should restrict freedom of levers or freedom of blinking, but rather that the act triggered by these things should be prohibited due to it's immorality based upon violation of the harm principle.

It isn't the duty of lords to go against commons it isn't the duty of lords to go against commons but, with that said, I certainly didn't find this the case when they refused to ban fox hunting... twice. Whilst lords are reformist they are also elitist. Whilst they should be *elite* in terms of education and experience, there does seem to be an attitude of entitlement to their position as opposed to viewing it as a public service to a country that has allowed them to have the, inevitably, cushy lifestyles that peers of the realm live.

To anyone who thinks that Lords have the moral duty above us (this list)[http://www.parliament.uk/mps-lords-and-offices/lords/] includes Peter Mandleson, old rich people, a bunch of bishops, and (still) the left over land owners from a bygone age in the form of hereditary peers. Hardly paragons of our political system. It wasn't until 1999 that they took away Prince Charles' vote.

true,atheistmil,cnty-uk,United Kingdom,"&gt; It's perhaps the biggest threat to the nation's mental wellbeing, yet it's freely available on every street â for pennies. The dealers claim it expands the mind and bolsters the intellect: users experience an initial rush of emotion (often euphoria or rage), followed by what they believe is a state of enhanced awareness. Tragically this ""awareness"" is a delusion. As they grow increasingly detached from reality, heavy users often exhibit impaired decision-making abilities, becoming paranoid, agitated and quick to anger. In extreme cases they've even been known to form mobs and attack people. Technically it's called ""a newspaper""

Mildly amusing.

The previous several paragraphs are vacuous bullshit used to try and fill word count. 

Maybe his article was trying to make a serious point? If so, then I'd say he failed as the first part of the article is more of a hipster ""hey look at me"" article. 

If he is not making a serious point and is only focusing on satire of the situation then, to use his own words: 

&gt; Unfortunately, facts are expensive, so to save costs and drive up sales, unscrupulous dealers often ""cut"" the basic contents with cheaper material, such as wild opinion, bullshit, empty hysteria, reheated press releases, advertorial padding and photographs of Lady Gaga with her bum hanging out. 

EDIT: It's less to do with his articles and more that the sycophantic praise he gets here for drawing breath grates after a while.

Well, that and the prolonged state sponsoring of terrorism. Equal rights for women, but you go to jail if you're not straight. Dropping bombs on his citizens because they dared not to want him as a leader with one of his sons as an obvious future leader.

The Mourinho era we were successful but I got a little bored of the style of footie played, it was quite contained and negative. I'll bypass to Ancelotti's era where we played well at times but not consistently enough, particularly the attacking play (my own opinion, I know others would say different).

This year we've started with some excellent attacking play. What I really like is the versatility we've shown. The United game was unlucky  and well designed tactically as we ripped them apart through the middle consistently throughout the game. The fact we passed the ball so successfully and consistently against Everton says a lot to me, dominating them is really impressive (we struggled last year). It is really early but the signs are extremely positive for sure. Lets make this judgement in a year or so after we've had some ups and downs ...

The forward plan should have been discussed much earlier, and people have been discussing it individually. It just never made it into the general assembly. In the end, it's come down to rash decisions and we're relying on the church being reasonable in giving us enough time to vacate. 

As with demands, there's too many different people around to formulate demands, as such. There's also far too few people to have any leverage on governments or corporations. It's a tricky situation. However, each day we're growing and expanding and that's good for the movement, but bad logistically: we *do* have limited space and personally I'm frustrated that it wasn't bought up earlier in the general assemblies (from what I've heard, we haven't had time to go to them). 

The ""protest"" is the fact that we've essentially created a functioning non-hierarchical commune. Where it goes from here is really not for me to say: ideally it would just expand and expand to the point that it becomes a realistic threat to the current capitalist state. Others seem to want it to just sway more people to vote labour. 

As I said, we're all individuals (heh). There's many different viewpoints and for that reason, we can't realistically reach consensus on where we want to go or what the future will hold.

true,lefthemisphere,tardis,TARDIS,"In 'public appearance mode' he was **absolutely awesome**. He took questions for about 45 minutes - had the crowd in stitches. He's funny, and somewhat snarky and just a hoot. I asked him a question about baking gear because my daughter and her friend are baking fools - he gave us shit because we didn't bring baked goods for him (daughter came down from college after her math test just in time for the signing and she doesn't have a kitchen at school or she WOULD have brought something).

He moved families with children to the front of the signing line so they didn't have to wait for the 300 or so people who were there. He stood instead of sitting, so he looked us in the eye. People went up to him 'individually' (or in our case as a group) and he took plenty of time with everyone. He signed ALL THE THINGS (drew an AB face doodle in my daughter's wooden spoon). Chatted with everyone (hence the mini-conversation about Doctor Who). He had an assistant close by who would take your camera and take photos while you were interacting with AB and a nice posed one after. So we have a whole set of really good photos from our moment. This was the best celebrity appearance/signing I've been to. 

Frankly, that's all he owes me as a fan. I'm willing to bet if he was a dick to someone, they did SOMETHING to warrant it. [I've read the 'fanifesto' on his blog](http://altonbrown.com/2011/09/my-fanifesto/) and I agree with every bit of it. I've seen a lot of the shit people have given him for it and I have a pretty strong feel for where the dickishness lies in that exchange...

true,benfitzg,null,null,"IMHO high rent is partly a function of high house prices. Landlords have mortgages too, and big ones given how overpriced housing is. So they charge more. Plus they are most likely being squeezed by inflation like everyone else. For example a landlord might suddenly find his food / petrol / etc has gone up so he decides to risk loosing a good tenant by putting up the rent.

The government (and especially Labour) presided over policies that increased demand for housing and blew up a credit bubble. Low supply plus excess cash =&gt; high asset prices. I'm pleased to see a few other posters on here pointing out this is a function of the market. People who decry that are being a bit disingenuous, unless they have never been to the pound shop instead of Waitrose for paper plates and have never asked for a pay rise.

So where is it all going? Because so many Brits are on the housing hook (and so are their banks) the BoE can't let the bubble deflate, so it keeps interest rates low as an artificial subsidy to debtors. Inflation goes up and savers are stealth taxed. The by-product is inflation, which is eroding the wealth of everyone, including the aforementioned landlord. That's why it's not going to work. We've been put in debt and someone has to pay.

not familiar with wordpress but I think changing the font to arial would be better. and use more text sizes (small, medium, large text all on the page). Using dark grey text or bold text are other possibilities. The goal is to make it look like there are multiple graphic layers on the page.

maybe change the background to at least not be pixelated. don't under-estimate the power and simplicity of a nice dark or light gray background. 

obviously won't reach these levels, but look at professional sites and how they use graphics to look 'important'

There seems to be a Mourinho limit at a club. We also won the title and reached the final of the CL after he left too, so maybe not that much of a dark day ...

To be fair, Bates took the club from bankruptcy to ... oh yeah, bankruptcy! In that time there were a lot of developments, particularly at the Bridge (although some are limiting any potential expansion of the ground) and a host of star players came in during the 90s. It was also his fault we had the tinkerman, loved by many but shockingly bad manager! So good and bad from Bates in all fairness.

River Song finds a vault and blasts the door open with a firearm, revealing a black box. She uses the firearm to burn a message in the ancient language of the Time Lords into a Home Box, the equivalent of a plane's black box, except it homes. Meanwhile, 12,000 years into the future, the Doctor and Amy Pond are in a museum, the Doctor explaining that most things there are incorrect until they come across the same home box we saw earlier. Amy is told of the power of the language of Time Lords and when Amy asks what it says, he exasperatedly replies ""Hello, sweetie"". The Doctor and Amy steal the box and retreat into the TARDIS.

I do agree that you can bear responsibility for the outcome without agreeing that the utterance of the words (or the stepping of your feet) is intrinsically immoral. The immorality does not lie with the words or the footsteps or the lever, it lies with the act of murder or theft or whatever.

&gt;That responsibility is not lessened by the fact that you spoke instead of pressing a button

But the responsibility isn't upon you for pressing a button, it's for killing people. The button pressing is itself harmless. It's the causal chain which follows which harms. Now I get that your point is that given that voice can initiate the causal chain, we can consider some usage of the voice to be immoral and legislate against them.

true,specofdust,scot-Highlands,Pasty Faced Haggis Rider,"&gt;Whether the act itself is speech or physical action is entirely irrelevant.

But the **act** is murder, or theft, or fraud, or rape, or whatever. The act is not speech.

Western law was (less so now) based broadly upon a Kantian type standpoint. Now Kant went a bit further than most of us tend to, but Western law followed Mill's harm principle fairly well for a good while, and to a lesser extent continues to today.

To say that words can violate the harm principle is absurd, because words are harmless. To say that murder violates the harm principle is so obvious as to be unnecessary to even observe it. You're (I think) saying that if words can bring about murder, they share in it's immorality. I'm saying that following your own thought experiment, any series of actions or motions or anything can bring about murder, and therefore everything must share in the immorality of everything.

I don't see how you get around this destruction of the concept of morality that your logic causes.

&gt;In your example above the act is certainly immoral but by removing the causal link from consideration you also remove the concept of responsibility.

It's not about removing the causal link, it's just about recognising that a causal link can have many chains and that only the outcome of certain acts is immoral, not the entire causal chain (otherwise, why stop at the words spoken, why not the breath in before the words were spoken, or the breakfast eaten that morning to give the person the strength to speak?).",0,1319298398,null,0,false,0,c2tjij7,t3_lf2me,t1_c2tjij7,t1_c2tj9lc,1427767260,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

Mels is Melody, after having been trained by The Silence, who at age 7 or so has been sent back in time to Amy's childhood to become Amy's childhood friend.  Young Amy never even knows of Mel's real identity let alone raises her.

Here's Melody's timeline as I understand it:

1. taken from her parents as a baby
2. raised by The Silence

I'm prepared to be corrected, but as far as I'm aware, I think pretty much the first person of note to use the term ""capitalism"" was a proto-anarchist, [Hodgskin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Hodgskin) (capitalist had been used before, more generically, to mean a ""monied man"").   He used it critically, to mean wealth backed by the State.  Adam Smith, of course, famously never used the term and was principally an anti-Mercantilist, posited a labour theory of value, and presumably would've been as disparaging of ""capitalists"" and ""capitalism"" as described by Hodgskin as Marx was...  It's a merry dance they've led us on.

Marx's own definition of capitalism was spread throughout Capital and hard to summarise without distorting it.  [This is a fair summary](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capitalist_mode_of_production#Defining_structural_criteria).

&gt;When someone says capitalism to me I understand them to mean free-market capitalism where the individuals own the means of production and their actions are motivated exclusively by a desire for profit.

true,fuxnoise,null,null,"Firstly, any group opposed to socialism of banks (the cause of government cuts) by definition is not anti-capitalist.  Since financial loss (not bailout) is supposed to be the reward for screwing up.

The problem is that there is lawless Capitalism, and Capitalism under rule of law.  The first is what we have, and the second is what we should have and is what at least the clued-up should be aiming for.

It all boils down to negligent, if not criminal, mis-selling of many financial products to unsuspecting clients. The sellers made money on both the selling, and then the betting that the purchaser would lose money. (Goldman Sachs's ""shitty deals"")

Many mortgages sold to long-term unemployed (Bush's ""Homeowner Society"") were bundled and then badly rated triple-A (by agencies who had to, or face a competitor getting the deal to rate it).

These golden, AAA, yet toxic securities where mis-sold to unsuspecting pension fund managers etc who would lose (meaning anyone with a pension is now a victim), and because the failure of unemployed persons to pay off a mortgage was predictable, the sellers bet against the purchasers (even after recommending them) hence the accusation of outright fraud.

Basically, there is no regulatory control in any domain anymore.  So the best criminal wins.  Capitalism should be where the best innovator wins, but that can only happen if criminals are behind bars and not let loose stealing from innovators.

Mainstream media would be the losers if rule of law is applied fairly eg against News Corp etc. (innovating in a fair market it harder than cheating).  So twisting perception of this movement is very important for the status quo.

Bellamy - Not a bad day for him honestly.

Kuyt - Bad day for Kuyt, made a few solid long passes in the air, but his touch today was awful, kept losing the ball.

Gerrard - Solid passing, was sending in picture perfect air balls in the last 5 minutes and some very nice through passes all game. I would like to see him shoot more though. Overall solid day for the skipper

Adam - Short passing was decent but he just seemed sluggish moving around. Also sent in some decent balls. Overall I'd say average, could have done better but not bad.

Downing - We have seen how good he is but today was not his day, no matter what he did.

Johnson - Solid day back, I don't have any complaints for him.

Skrtel - Played well in the back, had a solid chance in the 2nd minute with that header. Did what he could.

Carra - Definitely played hard today in the back but didn't have much of a presence all game.

Enrique - Some good some bad. First he was taking guys 1 on 1 and doing well. Short passes were solid and he was winning balls mostly. Only complaint was he sent a few long balls from the back to no one.

Reina - Should have came out earlier for the goal against him. Goalie error, he is better than that. Unfortunately one mistake as a keeper usually ends up as a goal.

Carroll - I think he should have came on earlier when Henderson came on. Made some bad touches dribbling. Should have scored that header in the dying minutes.

Henderson - didn't make much of a showing like he did against United. I saw him for the first couple of minutes he came on, then he seemed to disappear.

true,specofdust,scot-Highlands,Pasty Faced Haggis Rider,"That's pretty close at least.

Say let A be the set of things which I/You consider immoral (harm principle inspired for me, mostly if not entirely). Let set B consist of actions which can possibly be the direct causal link toward A.

*Iff B -&gt; A* seems like a simple starting point for me.

But the set of B is *everything* and anything a human can do, while the set of A is a fairly small *comparatively* easily defined set. If you want to consider things that precede A to be immoral if and only if they precede A, then you enter into a pointless episode whereby any act in A is immoral and any act in B is immoral iff it precedes A. But to do this is to violate Occam's Razor, if acts in B are only immoral in proximity to A, they are not really immoral, rather acts in A are. A-acts cast an immoral shadow upon B-acts, but to extend the status of actual immorality upon acts in B on an ad-hoc basis which cause no direct immorality needlessly is dangerous and, as I said, in violation of Occam's principle.

So why then should we consider things that precede A immoral, since A itself is immoral, and to be constantly adjusting whether something in B is or is not immoral based upon it's proximity to A is calamitous?

I argue we do not. B precedes A every single time, because B is the set of every act. To label B acts as immoral outright is obviously stupid, to label B acts immoral on an ad-hoc basis of their proximity to A is unnecessary, as we already have A acts which are intrinsically immoral and therefore need not further extend the definition (and in fact should always desire not to extend definitions beyond that which is needed).

I believe you overextend your definition of morality in a way which is dangerous and undesirable. By conflating causal chains and acts which result you muddy the waters, and this leads you to desire to prohibit that which is not immoral.

Also:

In other words *they* must prove the goods weren't faulty when you bought them and as a result have to offer you at the very least a repair.

2nd half: Really came out and gave a good performance. Those last couple of minutes were jittery but i feel we had enough chances ourselves to justify the end result. At the end of the day Liverpool were as wasteful as we were against Man Utd. Ruddy played great. I've said some bad things about him lately but that last save really saved us.

We are what we have been made into.  The mental illness that causes us to cause others harm sometimes is a symptom of some unfortunate mix of circumstances in life, and not anything we ever would have chosen for ourselves had we been given the choice.

Which also means that your own feeling of wanting to punish and kill others is also something that you were given, not something you chose.  If you had been given the choice to be the kind of person who intentionally wants to harm others and the kind of person who intentionally wants to effectively heal others and help them escape their demons so that they can be decent, honest, kind people, I'm sure you'd choose to be a powerful and wise healer...",0,1319320351,null,0,false,0,c2tm32a,t3_lkr67,t1_c2tm32a,t1_c2thn0o,1427768547,0,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,0

I've also heard that if you have a woman (say you're mum) as a named driver it can reduce your insurance cost. Never tried it myself.

Also, don't know how accurate this is, but my mate who deals with a lot of cars, has always said that the best kind of Clio to get is a Dynamique. Not really sure what the differences are (just cosmetic, I think). I'm sure you can look it up. Also, don't get anything older than 2000.

In one of your comments you've said you've got Â£3,000. I don't think you'll need to spend that much (mine was Â£1,800) but I'd recommend saving it to repair any faults that crop up.

If you do look at some Clio's, and they're mileage is somewhere between 50,000 and 60,000, check to see what work has already been done.

true,plain-text-summary,null,null,"    10# On the nourishment of spiders
    Rare is the interesting fact whose point is not immediately and deliberately missed by Alan. Take, for  
    example, Sean Lock's fascinating revelation that the huntsman spider is the only spider with lungs.  
    Alan's first observation? ""So you can get it a birthday cake with a candle on."" Yes, Alan. If it makes  
    you happy.

    9# On ornithology  
    Never let it be said that the nation's comics aren't all committed birdwatchers. Marcus Brigstocke was  
    impressed by news of a bird that can ""mimic anything"", and said he'd ""get it to do Bill Oddie."" To which  
    Fry replied, ""surely that would be a bearded tit, if it was anything."" Alan Davies swiftly corrected  
    him: ""You're thinking of Rory McGrath.""

    8# On domestic matters in China  
    There's been much talk lately of China's growing dominance, both economically and in terms of global  
    political influence. Stephen, clearly an expert, also revealed that according to the latest statistics,  
    the most dangerous cars are green and in China. Alan was in agreement. ""They're called tanks,"" he  
    pointed out. Ah.

    7# On the effect of trauma on the human brain  
    Loyd Grossman's accent is one of the great wonders of the natural world. And Alan is an expert on its  
    inflections. In fact, he even knows how it developed. ""You get a bang on the head and thatâs what  
    happens.""

    6# On the intricacies of the French language  
    Now, for all we know, Alan Davies can speak French with all the haughty fluency of a bow-tied waiter  
    about to eject you from a Michelin-starred restaurant for not chewing the right way. But, when asked by  
    Fry if he knew what the French for ""flying fish"" is, his response was: ""Poisson... d'aeroplane...?"" Very  
    good, Alan.

    5# On the joys of Christmas  
    Christmas, we're all agreed, is an utterly fantastic time. Fat glistening meats, tragic cracker jokes,  
    sodden grandmothers headbutting you after drinking too much sherry. But how do you stop your kids from  
    peeking at their Christmas pressies prior to the day? Alan Davies: ""Blind them.""

    4# On highly unfortunate surnames  
    Being called Jimmy Glasscock is surely tribulation enough, without having your unfortunate moniker being  
    brandished by Alan Davies for the amusement of the nation. ""We had a Jimmy Glasscock at school,"" Alan  
    revealed. ""Oh, did you?"" asked Stephen Fry. ""Yeah. You could always see him coming."" Dear oh dear.

    3# On the cleanliness of tunnels  
    Ever wondered how they clean the tunnels of the London Underground? Us too. Alan himself came up with a  
    solution worthy of Brunel: ""I don't understand why you can't have a â you know, like you used to have a  
    cleaning tape for your cassette deck â you can't have a cleaning Tube? You'd just send a big furry train  
    down...""

    2# On traditional dance  
    Apparently, the inventor of the Hokey Cokey died in 1996. Well, Stephen said so, and we're not about to  
    argue. Asking what happened at the chap's funeral, Mr Fry was met with Alan's response: ""Oh, it was  
    terrible, they couldn't get him into his coffin."" Why? ""Well, they put the left leg in... Then the  
    trouble started.""

    1# On punishing fruit  
    And we end with a rubbish joke told on primetime telly. Proving that such things were not the sole  
    preserve of Cannon and Ball in 1986. Take it away, Alan Davies: ""What's red and sits in a corner? A  
    naughty strawberry."" Brilliant.",0,1319327087,null,0,false,0,c2tmvk1,t3_ll3x2,t1_c2tmvk1,t3_ll3x2,1427768907,11,false,quiteinteresting,t5_2rfzr,11

true,admiraljustin,smith,Smith,"Passphrases have advantages and disadvantages.  On a home/small business level...

The longer password does include more bits of entropy on a purely mathematical level, but reduces itself to only needing to search numbers while trying to break.

Shorter, alphanumeric+symbol passwords have the problem of being too cumbersome for standard humans, leading to data either being lost or unable to be accessed.  It also lends more towards post-it notes on the monitor.

The optimal solution is to use a passphrase with a substitution or clever device to include an extra layer, such as Illbethere4you or $1Billyall or #ihatehashtags.

Thus thread OP is actually correct, though in general the need for substitution isn't as bad as his example.

a-z = 26 possibilities
a-zA-Z = 52 possibilities
a-zA-Z1-10 = 62 possibilities, etc.

In any mission critical system more advanced than what most people are likely to encounter things like spear phishing or social engineering attacks against people, using overly complex passwords is an advantage, but it is smarter to use additional layers of security, such as RSA keyfobs or biometric identification systems.

In short, for most consumer level services, a shorter passphrase with a simple substitution or 2 is going to be ideal, especially as many systems consumers access have length limits on passwords which may be too short to use a long phrase.

And in conclusion: find a system that works for you, make your passwords as complex as you can remember them, and NEVER, EVER share your password with anyone.

I really like the grumpy aspect of the Doctor at this point.  Behind the facade of an old man, he is cunning and feisty.  I felt that the pacing of this episode was very good for its age, as was the direction.  I just wish the quality was higher.

I like the parallel between the humans and the paleohumans.  The Doctor is to Ian and Barbara as they are to the paleohumans.  Also, their ability to create fire mimics the superior knowledge and power of the Doctor compared to the humans.  This is a major theme in the series, and its cool they established it so early on.

I like how the Doctor calls the TARDIS ""the ship"".

The protestors havent forced anything, rather the Cathedral has closed on the advice of their own Health and Safety consultants (notably not the local council or fire service who, following changes, apparently dont have any concerns about the camp).

The cynic in me wonders whether now that the St Paulâs got their magnanimous moment in the press/on TV by turning aside the police and welcoming in the protestors, that they now want to be rid of them because theyâre inconvenient, impacting upon visitor numbers and thus the revenue that the tourists bring in. Again being cynical, I wonder whether the church wants to be rid of them by claiming they need to shut because of advice from their own health and safety consultants/insurance, thus are at risk of a significant economic loss and thus can turn to the police to get the protestors moved on.

I wonder what Jesus would have done in such a situation? Oh wait I think I can recall my RE lessons: it was the only time he got violent and he kicked the money changers and dove sellers out of the temple (Matthew 21:12-13). That is perhaps a little bit of a low blow, the cathedral is after all not simply a building that can be shut off and on at demand, itâs an organisation that employs a lot of staff and uses the money raise for good works and causes, and there are other small businesses in the area about the square that are being impacted.

The protestors might be inconvenient and people with different views are absolutely entitled to disagree with their rather disparate messages, and indeed counter protest/criticise their message and methods etc. However I think that it's important that people can peacefully protest.

I like to think it's real too, but I wonder about the bit where Derren got four volunteers to throw 'acid' into someones face. Allegedly the concept was 'if you're hypnotized, you'd throw the acid, if not you wouldn't.'  Yet common sense says a TV show would never get people to actually throw acid at others; so they must have known it wasn't 'real' imo. *

I wonder if the point of that wasn't actually to get them to realize that Derren wouldn't actually make them hurt anybody... who knows; the ice bath thing convinced me well enough.

(* A better test to really see if anyone's faking would have been saying 'One of these is real acid, I'll make three of you throw but not the 4th... then make all 4 throw. Thus any faker might wonder if they've been hypnotised to throw or not.)

I'd just like to finish by saying that I am a supporter of Human Rights generally and the right to freedom of expression specifically. However, even at the most fundamental of levels, the Universe in which we live is governed not by absolutes but by probabilities and since I don't believe in any kind of God I cannot believe in an absolute right to anything, free speech included. By what agency would this right be conveyed? At what stage in a creature's evolution are rights suddenly conveyed? Since the right as you describe it is binary there would need to be an external agent or trigger evaluating a creature's suitability, which is obviously ludicrous. The alternative is that these rights apply equally to every species on the planet and any we find in the wider Universe, which again is ridiculous.

I believe that in this Universe of probabilities it is an immoral act to deliberately and knowingly increase the probability of violence befalling a person or group of people and that it is exactly this act that incitement (and conspiracy) charges have been created to cover. I would agree that your concept of free speech is a worthy ideal to hold but any expectation that it would survive contact with reality is hopelessly naive.

That is precisely what a sick minds like Ted Bundy, Jeffrey Dahmer, Hitler, or even Ghaddafi believed.

It's unfortunate that such horrible beliefs exist as the symptoms of mental illness, but, we can always remember...

Bad things are:

A: Subjective.

B: Always in existence.  With creation there must be destruction as well.

But, yes, it's a good idea to try to help people heal, if we want to keep the ""bad things"" such as mental illness to minimum.  The healthier we are, the more we can eliminate these dangerous symptoms effectively, by healing the people who are sick.  Obviously, the greater good comes from win-win solutions, where those who are sick are healed into being decent, honest, creative, and loving individuals, who go on to do great things, rather than being dead or sick.

The writers of Doctor Who aren't as healthy as I wish they were, which is they still behave as if the most powerful individual in the universe would use violence and make people worse by harming them.  But, perhaps, it's a statement to remind us humans that even the most powerful person in the universe isn't perfect, and gets sick sometimes.",0,1319377752,null,0,false,0,c2tr6f9,t3_lkr67,t1_c2tr6f9,t1_c2tmwx5,1427770932,1,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,1

You have to firstly come from the political perspective that the system is broken though.

Not everyone thinks it is broken, just damaged.

If the complaints are articulated in childish manners - then why not? Anyone involved in politics will receive many and very lengthy policy suggestions backed up with facts, suggestions and methods of implementation.

Then there are the rent-a-mobs who rant and scream in meaningless soundbites and offer nothing of any factual substance.

You can say you'll listen to the childish rants, but it is frankly a waste of time to do so. Time that can be devoted to reading the well thought through proposals and seeing how much of them are workable.

Drogba was just plain bad, so no excuses there, and if we were going to have to rely on another performance like that against Arsenal, I would rather start Kalou.

Having said that, our best hope is that this will galvanize the team. Give them that ""everyone is against us, so we can only rely on each other"" mentality. Villas-Boas is a fantastic man manager, so I really expect him to use this to push the players forward. We've made progress every match this season, and I don't think this was any exception. The understanding of the players in a fluid, dynamic environment was something to be admired. To me, this showed another step in the right direction. 

They played an immense second half. Lampard made some amazing runs into the box, and honestly, I am more proud of the performance they put in than I am mad at the ref. I am glad that we will have Sturridge and Torres available to try and get in behind Mertesacker, as I think their pace will be a mismatch. Plus, we usually get a good performance in derby matches.

true,mad_disciple,null,null,"Ok, here's some of my own thoughts on this game. We were poor before we had any players sent off, poor in possession, poor in closing down, just not in the game very much. After QPR scored we started getting some possession and playing the game a bit better. Then the red cards changed everything in that regard.

David Luiz was excellent in the second half. However, he was at fault for the two big turning points in the game. First, his lunge in the back for the penalty was just stupid, mind numbingly stupid! Second, he was way out of position and didn't recover to close the defensive gap that led to Bosingwa's red card. After about 70 minutes I'm not sure if he even went into defence. In the last 10 minutes or so I'm not sure he tracked back into our own half. He was out on his feet from running so much with 9 men but defensively he's just not good enough at the moment. He's a liability as a CB. Try him holding but I'm not convinced of his passing ability yet, so patience is gonna be needed.

Not one 50/50 decision went Chelsea's way today. Also, the attitude towards the ref probably didn't help. Why would he give any decisions our way when they're all swearing and berating him? I agreed with the players being annoyed, the decisions were ridiculous, but they need to be more professional and leave any questioning to the captain. That didn't help us.

With 9 men we were simply magnificent. The style of play was really unexpected with fluency akin to total football adopted by Ajax in the 70s. I've never seen such confidence or ability from a team with 9 men before, they always close the doors and shut up shop. That effort was simply astonishing. Particular mention goes to Lampard who ran his guts out to make sure Anelka wasn't isolated when he got any possession. This also made QPR lose their shape as they chased their tail not quite knowing what to do. Tactically it appeared they were inept in the second half, which doesn't surprise me as I've never been a Warnock fan. 

I saw a look on AVB's face prior to the team leaving the field at half time and he seemed to be weighing up what to do. I think he got it spot on for the second half, it was an incredible change.

I hope the 11 to play Arsenal next weekend is rested in midweek. These players are going to want to kill their next opponents after this so Arsenal will come under a barrage from Chelsea.

Mikel was good today but was asked to do a lot. He kinda ended up in defence and was solid at breaking up plays in the second half, don't mistake his role in the team when they were at 9 men. Also, his fitness was impressive. When others, notably Luiz, were virtually out on their feet he continued to work, chase and break up play well.

Chris Foy should never referee another Chelsea game again. I don't care if he refs other games or not but there's no way he could ever ref a Chelsea game fairly after this. 

I don't agree with you on 'trouble among a few seniors'. There just seemed to be an issue with Drogba's attitude. He isn't first choice, we all know that, and he'll probably be leaving at the end of the year. Don't forget he's nearly 34 now so not in his prime any more. I've loved his service to the club, he's been instrumental for us, but if he continues playing like that and having this kind of attitude then his days are numbered. I'm not sure he fits the style of play either. He's physical as the team is getting more precision based football that suits Torres better.",0,1319404508,null,0,false,0,c2tu8yh,t3_lm7ay,t1_c2tu8yh,t3_lm7ay,1427772470,4,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,4

true,Lopretni,eccleston,Eccleston,"I don't care for the whole idea of turning the entire series into one plot, as Moffat as done with the last two seasons. It isn't bad, but not my cup of tea. I much prefer to see the Doctor and his companions in seemingly random situations, then the last few episodes dealing with a problem and going back to the way things were. The main reason I don't like the Moffat format is that the episodes that don't mention the season's conflict feel completely pointless. The cupboard episode would have been amazing if it was played before A Good Man, as it should have been, but it just earned my ire and disdain while I still knew I would have loved it had I not been wanting to see what the hell River Song's problem is.

The same thing goes for that hotel episode. It was an interesting premise and probably would have done more for me if I didn't want them to hurry up and show the Doctor dying and everything. But, maybe I'm just impatient?

I feel that the Daives years did it better where the giant overarching plot lines happened all at once, rather than, ""Oh, we're going to put this giant plot on hold so we can go to Mars for no reason."" It just feels lazy, like they couldn't make more episodes for the plot at hand, and it's frustrating. Classic who was never afraid of having a plot line last for what had to have been dozens of episodes at a time without any large breaks (AFAIK, I just know that I read about these serials and they're like 6 episodes, 10 episodes, etc.) Then again, the show is now in a totally different era. Things like costs and timeslots would have to be considered if they wanted to make a 26 episode serial.

That being said, I still respect Moffat's writing as being genius and I do love how the character of the Doctor is being explored. I note that a lot of that forgotten plot from the Seventh Doctor's era (The Doctor as a darker character, questioning his role in things, the Doctor being more than a scrubby run of the mill Time Lord, etc.) seems to have been reborn here, and they're all things that interested me when I first read through the Wikipedia pages of all the different regenerations.

I don't know. I don't care for the direction but I think I'd be bored if it were, ""10 random episodes and 3 that are some big epic storyline that deal with the Daleks because apparently the Doctor only has one enemy."" I give Moffat and the production team props for trying new things, even if they don't work out (for me).

So Smith will leave, someone other than Moffat might become the main writer, and companions will change, but it will still have a Who feeling... So even with all the changes, I think it's still going to be at least interesting. 

I've heard people say before that Smith brings a new darkness to the character, but I feel like Eccleston and Tennat did, as well. Eccleston's Doctor was standoffish, not trusting, kind of rude and defensive. Tennant's was so lonely, and occasionally so hurt. I feel like they both had a certain darkness in them, and that Smith is just doing it differently.

I watched the very first few episodes with the First Doctor a while back, and I find it interesting that his Doctor was a bit dark, too, but the most prevalent difference between the oldest and the newest Doctors seems to be that he was a bit immoral, whereas the modern Doctors may be dark/mean/cruel/whatever sometimes, but they still seem to strive for being ethical/moral. They're concerned with being fair, and good, and all that. This made me really love the episode in which Smith's Doctor tricks the older version of Amy and decides to leave her to die.

And it's just so interesting when you realize that, despite the fact that the Eleventh is the youngest in terms of appearance, he's the oldest, wisest and could be considered the most mature currently. I like the Tenth Doctor's quote to the Fifth Doctor, something like, ""You know, when I first started out with this, I was all old and stuffy, trying to be important..."" It's just funny because the First, according to Ten was just completely full of himself and thought he knew everything. A typical teenager, yet he looked seventy!

And yes, the nuWho three Doctors all have a different kind of darkness to them. Nine being torn from the ravishes of war, Ten lonely and Eleven... I think the deal with Eleven is responsibility and title. I  mean, it's the recurring theme with it currently. How much power does the Doctor really have, and should he have it? That kind of thing. He's dark just based on who he is and his history, not based on any OBVIOUS character traits. It's interesting.

true,jawnn,lfc12,,"I think judging players we signed this summer is really all just speculation and intended to appease our own lack of patience. Kenny's nearly bought a brand new team, we're still kinda toying with formations that work for us correctly. 

I think we just need to find the right fit for Charlie and who he plays best with, personally I think he was alright in a 4-2-3-1 beside Stevie because they were alternating joining the attack and both lurking about the box when we were in it. Charlie's got GREAT vision and if you really think about it, him and Aquilani played the nicest passes we've seen this year (not this season but this year IMO) to create goals. 

Downing is working his way in but people don't hate on him as much because they seem to expect less from him; a wide attack who will spray crosses in, but I think Downing has had a vastly lesser impact on the club as a whole since he joined where Charlie has made his qualities noticeable - which makes it easy to attack the ones he lacks. Yeah, he's not speedy, yeah, he's aggressive (yet Lucas is the one who sat a game out from picking up yellows, but nobody wants to be the judas and say something about that) to boot. It's not like we signed Manchester City's marquee boy. We don't have too many who can smash them in from distance or at least even try to really - again to mention Lucas, I think he's one of the only people who will give it a go from range (Andy maybe from 25 on his snap-turn-shoot crap, Skrtel and Agger have their hopeful rockets, Downing is clearly willing to shoot from almost anywhere but lets face it he needs to work on his accuracy bigtime) and I feel that Adam is a fairly versatile player in his positions. He's good in the middle, he's not a WIDE player per say but he doesn't have to play the 1 in a 4-1-2-1-2 or NEED to be centered, he's been offcentre in most matches. 

His long balls make Woy's mouth water, I think it was against..United maybe - how many deadly accurate lobs did he play to Downing? It was unbelievable how much open space Downing got on the left there and how Charlie just kept picking him out. We'd all love to see him work on his tackles and some are just blatantly unnecessary, but we have to give him credit for the performance he's put in having come to a club as big as ours. 

Here's a few ways I've learned to rationalize Charlie Adam as a red.

1. Did we dump 35m to get MUCH less than what he's given us? noooo sirr.
2. Is he goalless, assistless or spraying balls off target?
3. When we take this season, think about 'uplifting seconds' and testing the woodwork, who's name comes to mind?
4. Second only to Enrique (and suarez I guess but he don't count for this example) - Charlie's been making some marauding runs covering more than half the pitch, often with nobody around to even try to lay off to or anything. For a non-pacey non-attacker, Adam seems to find himself in the final third looking around more than any of our other players. 
5. Was there a tooth there before..or did you just never see a dentist your whole life, cmonnn you gotta love Gappie Adam!

I think that by the end of the season we'll have been shocked by some absurd long rangers, some 60+ yard passes that make even Stevie smile and plenty of gap-filled celebrations.

I'm a Blues fan all the way, and the Barcelona games will haunt me forever in terms of referee decisions, but as a fan of the beautiful game as well I do want to say that if we don't score goals without the help of referees pointing to the spot, then we deserve to lose.

All the possession we had in the QPR game should translate to at least 1 point through a goal.  So to avoid frustration on both ends, I say take it out of the officials' hands and score a goal they can't overturn.  *And if they do decide to overturn a legal goal*, then that's what I feel is warranted blaming of the referees.

true,Gangplank,1905,,"I agree with your sentiment. I think people feel so upset because the early penalty and red card set the tone for the rest of the match. The biggest problem is not that we couldn't win the match without the referees help, which I certainly don't think the penalties he missed were the biggest fault in the game. Rather, it was the fact that this is a ""professional"", who is handsomely paid and given the honor of presiding over a match at a high level play. His ability to judge situations and dole out appropriate punishment was not on the same level as the ability of the players to play the game. When this happens, he becomes a burden on the game. It also became pretty clear that he was swayed by the massive atmosphere at the stadium, which is also a clear problem for an ""impartial"" judge.

We had our chances today and should have taken them, and there is no excuse for that. Whether it's 11 against 11 or 8 against 11, a team that does not take its chances will not take the points. I fully support the notion that ""The best referee is the one you never talk about."" This doesn't mean he takes no action, but rather moderates the game in a fashion that, as a neutral spectator, one would already be thinking that that would be the appropriate punishment before any action is taken. Expecting the players to police themselves is equivalent to that one kid you played cops and robbers with who never stayed down after he was ""shot.""

We as an audience never had seen these characters before, never had seen any of these monsters or worlds and he was learning about them right along with us. On the other hand you have the 11th Doctor. He's an old man in a young man's body. The antithesis of the 1st. He's been there, done that, which is why I love the reasoning he gave as to why he picks up companions. Everything is new in their eyes. They're his ""babies"". There was an episode this past series that I just loved for the Doctor. He had absolutely no idea of what was going on, ""That doesn't happen very often."", and yet again I saw that same glimmer of excitement of the first Doctor.

true,rand_althor,silence,Silence,"Depends what you're looking for.  I've not read that many Doctor Who novels, most of what I have read has been from the Eighth Doctor Adventure line.  So, from that...

The first entry in the EDA line, Terrance Dicks' ""The Eight Doctors"" is a fun read.  Taking place very soon after the TV movie, the Doctor happens upon a trap in the TARDIS laid by the Master, and the trap wipes the Doctor's memories.  To regain them, he travels along his own timeline, encountering his previous incarnations at various points.  A lot of the encounters end up being during televised adventures.  A fun read, to be sure.

Lawrence Miles' ""Alien Bodies"" is a truly excellent book.  Describing the narrative even slightly runs the risk of spoiling it, but it involves representatives from numerous alien races convening on Earth to bid on an auction of a powerful object.  (""Alien Bodies"" also introduces the Faction Paradox, which appears later in the EDA line.

Looking outside the EDA line, there's Paul Cornell's ""Human Nature"", from the New Adventures line (I think).  It's an adventure with Seven and Bernice Summerfield and was, of course, adapted to the televised two-parter, ""Human Nature""/""The Family of Blood"" (with numerous changes that made the source material quite a different story).

For a bit more complicated story, there's ""Lungbarrow"", which attempts to tell an origin story for the Doctor.

While not novels, the Big Finish book series, ""Short Trips"", are always excellent reads.  The Short Trips books feature short stories from authors who have never before been published.

My position isn't that government acts as a neutral referee between capitalists and anti-capitalists, but that it resolutely and continually represents the interests of the capitalist class (in the historical sense) against the rest of us.  Sure, it may act in their long term interests rather than their short term ones, by introducing protections to ameliorate the worst excesses of raw exploitation for example, or in the interests of one powerful or influential faction over another, but ultimately it's there to protect the capitalist system, and it will mobilise all of its resources when that system is fundamentally threatened.

&gt;It's the free market with their level of intervention in certain areas.

I'm not sure I understand what you mean by this.  You'll need to expand if I've got it wrong, but I'm assuming you're arguing the market in the UK is pretty much free with minimal government intervention ""as necessary"".  I'm not sure I'd agree with either limb of that statement, I don't believe our markets are anything like free, quite the contrary, they are broadly State-rigged.  As for the implicit ""as necessary"" (which I inferred and attributed to you, so feel free to withdraw it!), I'd just ask, necessary for whom, cui bono?  The vast majority of the important monopolies exploited by the mercantlists Smith rightly reviled are still in place today (including the four big ones - land, tariffs, patents and money) and zealously guarded by governments around the world with increasingly hysterical fervour.

I'm very much in the Adam Smith camp, worshipped from afar by capitalist apologists, but rarely deeply understood, and where understood, usually discarded when inconvenient.  After all, this was the man who espoused a(n admittedly incomplete) labour theory of value, who despised rentiers (""The landlords, like all other men, love to reap where they never sowed, and demand a rent even for its natural produce""), and who recognised a cartel where he saw one (""We rarely hear, it has been said, of the combinations of masters, though frequently of those of the workman. But whoever imagines, upon this account, that masters rarely combine, is as ignorant of the world as of the subject."" and ""People of the same trade seldom meet together, even for merriment and diversion, but the conversation ends in a conspiracy against the public, or in some contrivance to raise prices."")",0,1319432752,null,0,false,0,c2ty2kt,t3_lkyyb,t1_c2ty2kt,t1_c2tkiwb,1427774274,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

Yours is to watch them in ""chronological"" order but, say, today or tomorrow, or in a month.  Which is a lot more realistic.

It doesn't REALLY matter in the grand scheme of things, but anyone that watches the show on even a semi-regular basis (that is, say, enough to know that Matt Smith is in it) should know that the character's name is not (and never HAS been) Doctor Who.

The Doctor is not his real Gallifreyan name, but a moniker he has chosen for himself.  Him being referred to in the credits as ""Doctor Who"" is due to little more than a jokey tradition and he has NEVER been referred to as ""Doctor Who""  onscreen (other than in slight joke references in regards to that tradition).

the plan was he was supposed to start off aggressive and the total opposite to Peter Davison's nice guy Doctor... the plan being in the many years he would play the character his character would get over the post regen-trauma and mellow out (the idea being this regeneration was particularly bad as he did almost die so it was a bit messed up) and become the nice-guy Doctor all over again.. his relationship with Peri would become similar again to the 4th/5th with his companions.

However, Michael Grade came in and put the show on hiatus so it never got to happen.

If you watch a seriel from The Trial Of A Time Lord called ""The Mysterious Planet"" ... not only is it a good seriel (and features the first appearance of the underated Sabalom Glitz) you will see what I believe is a true representation of the Sixth and his relationship with Peri.

They'd be travelling for many many years in the interim between the last broadcast episode 18 months previous (and if you take the audios etc. as canon she even returned to earth to finish studying at one point then returned to The Doctor) and you can see by the way Bryant and Baker are playing their roles the characters have grown very very close.

Marian Conspiracy (a true, honest to goodness historical. No scifi aside from the Doctor and the TARDIS)
The Specter of Lanyon Moore (Brigadier!), 
Apocalypse Element (loosely connected to some other Doctor's stories, but it's not necessary to listen to them. Also, Time Lords and Romana. And Daleks. Also sets the stage for the Gallifrey audioplays if those are your thing. They're not bad.),
Bloodtide (Charles Darwin and Silurians),
Project: Twilight,
The Sandman (Why Six wears that ridiculous coat.),
Jubilee (The source for the 2005 episode Dalek. This one is much better.),
and Project: Lazarus (Sequel to Twilight),

I'm not completely caught up on Evelyn yet, but here are some other good ones:
The Holy Terror (with Frobisher, from the comics. Probably my favorite Six.)

If you have no problems with Mel (I don't mind her all that much, but some people can't stand her), then The One Doctor is absolutely fucking hilarious. The Juggernauts features Davros. Catch-1782 is a bit of a slower story, but I liked it.

The big grouping I'd recommend is the ones with Charley, but you have to listen to the Eight series first. I would strongly recommend you do it because nothing beats listening to socialist Daleks sing ""The Internationale"".

I agree with almost all of your points except a few:

&gt; the attitude towards the ref probably didn't help. Why would he give any decisions our way when they're all swearing and berating him? I agreed with the players being annoyed, the decisions were ridiculous, but they need to be more professional and leave any questioning to the captain. That didn't help us.

The ref is supposed to be emotionally unbiased as well, right? He can't not give decisions because a particular team has been swearing and cussing for previous wrong decisions. If, according to your belief, the ref is allowed to hold the slightest of 'grudges' (not the best of words, but I can't find another word here) then the players are allowed to lose their cool as well?

I was a little harsh on Mikel - he had too much to do, agreed.

Don't get me wrong, I love Drogba and his game/service to Chelsea to pieces. However, his attitude was not much different from what Modric behaved as a Tottenham player early on in the season. You just can't do that to your fans/audience. Look at Anelka, for instance. He's definitely quitting at the end of the season. That didn't stop him from playing his heart out, did it?

As for David Luiz, I see bucket-loads of potential in the little bugger. He just needs to calm the fuck down IMO.

They do it by selling the same product in different ways, in an expensive format to those who won't switch provider, and in a cheaper format to those who will. The answer is simple, force them to have a single tariff and have no switching bonuses or discounts or rebates. Then they'll have only one product to compete with and we'll see proper competition.

Now that you mention it, though, he is very much into saving small groups(So far, I'm halfway through second season of audio adventures).  Actually, as a sidenote, I think there was a definite precursor to the Time War in one of the episodes. I've always meant to mention it, but never have.

It's an episode where this alternate dimension being(God Complex reminded me a lot of it)that fed off of fear. But it was only 'good' fear, like the kind you get off of adrenaline rushes. So The Doctor fed all of his fears, of everything he's ever done, into the creature.

In the original BBC draft documents the character was going to be called ""Doctor Who"".  However, this was quickly abandoned and any reference to ""Doctor Who"" is made in reference to not knowing his real name (ie....BARBARA:  ""But, Doctor Foreman?"".....DOCTOR:  ""Doctor Who?"")  He has never been referred to onscreen as ""Doctor Who"", but was very quickly during the First Doctor's tenure referred to as ""The Doctor"".

Also, there is no established Doctor Who canon.  There is no George Lucas or Gene Roddenberry to say what is and what isn't...the BBC has made NO statements about Doctor Who canon, so it has fallen into that gray area of ""whatever you want to be canon IS.""  Myself, I consider only what's aired on television to be canon, though even this gets muddles as the show has given 2 different explanations for the Loch Ness Monster and 3 different reasons for the sinking of Atlantis over the years.  See where I'm going with this?

But, by your logic, the fact that it's never been stated that Doctor Who ISN'T a proper moniker...the same could be said for the fact that they've never stated his name is NOT Cedric.  So, there you go....Cedric.  Well done.

Like much of this kind of drama I often feel it stop short of adequately exploring meaning and choice. There was the whole: we spies tell ourselves so many lies that we bury ourselves ... sentiment. That is a bit humdrum as an idea. There was also the whole choose work V choose life issue, Harry Pearce (Firth) choosing work (in the absence of Ruth Evershed (Walker)).

The real shame of the whole series is that Macfadyen pulled out. Rather, it would have been artistically right either for the series to end after season 2 (When Tom shoots Harry and swims off into the sea); Or MacFadyen stayed on throughout.

The originality of the series seemed to ride on the combination of the intensity of the acting brought by Firth to Pearce and Macfadyen to Quinn; with the intensity of the writing/plot. There was some kind of compelling intensity and dynamism about the Firth/Pearce and Macfadyen/Quinn relationship that was never subsequently matched nor sufficiently explored.

So, for me, any greatness in writing found best expression through Firth/Pearce for the rest of the series. So, for example, in the very last episode when Ruth offers/insists that Harry leave the job and make a life in the cottage all that Firth/Pearce needs to do is smile in acceptance. Not a word was uttered. That is exquisite drama and acting.

The hollowness in meaning Pearce might feel, in virtue of losing the opportunity to retire with Ruth, can be contrasted with the achievement of a full and masterly exercise of a craft that Firth is entitled to feel, in virtue of acting the role.",0,1319452719,null,0,false,0,c2tzjl2,t3_lmgts,t1_c2tzjl2,t3_lmgts,1428185937,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

But the ambition is focussed in the wrong places. Not everyone needs to go to univeristy.

&gt;If people are too focused on what a 'real' A-Level 'real' GCSEs and 'real' degrees 

Hate to break it to you, but in the real world this is exactly what everyone is focussed on. Telling kids that a degree in media from ex-polytech university is worth the same as english from Oxford is cruel.

&gt;it severely undermines the tremendous achievements that people have 

The idea that university is right for everyone has done a lot more to undermine achievement than anything else. These achievements are hollow; people are sold degrees that just aren't worth what they think they are, but because they have a degree they think they can walk into any job. That's what shatters dreams and undermines confidence.

WARNING MAJOR CHARACTER SPOILERS ON THIS PAGE

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cracker_%28UK_TV_series%29


Edit: here is the overview pasted over to avoid any accidental spoilers

&gt;Fitz is a classic antihero, unfaithful to his wife, alcoholic, a chain smoker, obese, addicted to gambling, manic, foul-mouthed and sarcastic, and yet cerebral and brilliant. He is a genius in his specialty: criminal psychology. As Fitz confesses in ""Brotherly Love"": ""I drink too much, I smoke too much, I gamble too much. I am too much.""
&gt;
&gt;Each case spanned several episodes and cliffhangers were quite often used, but it was not until the end of the second series that a cliffhanger was employed to tie off the series. Some of the plotlines in the cases took as their starting point real events such as the Hillsborough disaster, while others were purely fictional with only tangential ties to actual events.
&gt;
&gt;Several different psychotic types were explored during the run of the show with increasingly complex psychological motivations that, as the series entered the middle of the second series, began to expand beyond the criminals being investigated to the regular cast members. As the series moved forward the storylines became as much about the interactions of the regulars as it was about the crimes. In many later episodes, in fact, the crimes often became background to intense, provocative explorations of the police officers' reactions to the crimes they investigated.
&gt;
&gt;To emphasise how fine a line the police (and Fitz) walk in their close association with criminals, all three series featured several stories in which the police themselves become criminals or victims of crime.

&gt;Wow you're hating to break things to me a lot today!

Only when you quote the same sentence twice. :)

&gt;undermine certain degrees out of nothing but snobbery.

It's not just snobbery though, is it? Because some degrees are massively preferred to others by employers. I'm very pleased you're doing a degree purely for the love of it, and you're clearly under no illusions that it might not be the best course for employability afterwards. But many people aren't aware of this difference and perhaps if they were they would think again before embarking on it.

&gt;is going to really harm the self esteem of the individual

Well boo-fucking-hoo. Sorry, but the trend to tell everyone they are brilliant at everything is what has gone wrong with our education system. Some people are not suited to academic education. This is not to say they are useless or stupid, just that they should not bother with trying to get a lesser degree, but should instead focus their energies on something they are more suited to. Personally, I would rather have my self esteem harmed than spend 3 years, Â£1000's doing a degree that no employer would look at twice.

No honey, it's DVD quality and you can watch whatever you want, when you want it and it arrives in minutes.  

As a journalist her opinion has gone from: Evil pirates and downloaders ruining the entertainment industry and breaching copyright law to: "" My gawd, this is fucking great, why can't I do this legally?""

I've recently worked with different departments from Response (the 999 jobs), Neighbourhoods (high visibility foot and car patrols dealing with anti social behaviour) and Investigation dealing with investigating the major crimes that the other teams find.

I've worked in policing for a few years and worked around different departments and helped others, such as Traffic and Dogs, where possible. The great thing about the job is you can do lots of different jobs without changing career.

With regards to moral conflicts, sometimes I wonder if I'm doing the ""right"" thing. For example busting a teenager with a bit of pot. Best advice I can give is do it in private. I busted three young lads with weed in an car park at 2am sitting with the engine and lights on smoking away - this is how you get caught! Some officers aren't as keen on legalisation as others so for basic protection to yourself I'd recommend doing it somewhere quiet.

Other issues could be speeding, for example, which we all do. I understand it is a little hypocritical to give people tickets for speeding when I might speed on my way home after work. However I argue (with myself!) that if I got stopped I'd expect a ticket and understand it would be my fault.

Most moral conflicts I have are over the lack of options we as police have to stop harm coming to other people. For example ""knowing"" who is doing certain crimes but needing the evidence. It can be hard to remember that we have to abide by the laws and regulations and find that evidence rather than trying to exaggerate what has happened to back up your case. Of course this also makes you more determined to get them, and increases the satisfaction when you do.

In short, I believe every officer should have a taser. I currently have a metal asp and pepper spray - both of these can produce serious injury or even kill when used. I have them because I'm expected to get into situations where I risk my life to do ""something"".

To use the metal asp I have to be within a few feet of someone. Someone who could be high on drugs, alcohol, have metal health problems, or just really hate police. He could be bigger or stronger than me and could rip the asp from my hand and use it against me. I could hit him and it does nothing or I could hit him and kill him.

To use the pepper spray I need to be about 5-12 feet from someone and hope I get their face. I need to hope they are not the small percentage of the population who it has no effect on. I need to hope they are the type of person who it does not make more angry and I need to hope it doesn't affect me more than it does them (especially with wind working against you). I can't use it in hospitals, cars, or small rooms unless really necessary as it will affect everyone else there (and in hospitals go into the air conditioning and potentially kill a patient in another room).

I have yet to see Taser not have some effect on a person. Yes they are ""less lethal"" but so are my other weapons. And they are less lethal than some of my other weapons! No death has been linked directly to Taser usage. They tend to occur from secondary injuries (such as falling and hitting their head) or previous medical conditions, but these could happen with the other things too.

Some officers aren't as keen on legalisation as others so for basic protection to yourself I'd recommend doing it somewhere quiet.

As someone on the front lines, what changes would you make to drug policy? Weed is already pretty much decriminalised insofar as you're very unlikely to go to prison for it, and you've pretty much hinted you're in favour of legalisation.

What about other drugs? Obviously magic mushrooms or LSD aren't like meth or heroin and it's ridiculous that the law currently requires an identical response for all of them.

Burglars come and go, lives don't. I'd rather we called off one pursuit than had to stand in coroner's court and say we were partly responsible for that death. Unfortunately life isn't always easy and these decisions are made in fast time and can go wrong.

Some times though you can make your own risk assessment. For example we are not, specifically, supposed to jump into rivers and try to save someone.

I live in SE London. Now anyone familiar with the are will know certain areas can sometimes end up quite demographically split, for example if you were to look at the make up of the people going in and out of Lewisham station you'd find more Afro-Caribbean people than if you did the same at Grove Park.

I used to travel into work to Charing Cross via Lewisham and often saw at around the hours of between 4pm and 5pm on my return home, a large police presence, searching pretty much every young black male that came through dressed a certain way (I myself would have been dressed for work, pressed trousers, dress shirt, shoes etc...so I was never ever stopped).

I then began going via Grove Park in the mornings and started seeing a strange occurrence... heightened police presence first thing in the morning, between the hours of 7am and 8am, and this time searching only white passengers trying to get to work. Even the odd young black guy who ventured past was not bothered on these occasions.

The cynic in me saw it as some sort of balancing act, as if they could fudge the numbers and make it look as if they were not specifically targeting one particular ""type"" of person on an evening in Lewisham. So if they were ever asked they could show the number and say ""well look, we stopped and searched just as many white people as black people"".

Is this something that happens or have I become overly jaded over the years?

That prior to 5, he'd always been trying to be so old, so important (like you do when you're young). The Master said he wanted to be young and strong, so he got a younger regeneration. As mentioned in the comments Romana did control her regeneration specifically, but that and the ginger thing can be easily reconciled. Every regeneration of the Doctor has been due to death, and none of them looked very peaceful, the Master's was also due to death from a gunshot wound (not to mention being his first regeneration since being reincarnated and his first regeneration since the time-lords were sent away), while Romana's was just an act of will. So we can probably say that it does take a lot of concentration to control the specifics, a level of concentration not possible while you're dying, however you can guide something very general like your age-range. 

The other thing about companions influencing personality isn't a regeneration thing. With the first eight Doctor's it's hard to make an influence argument, the regenerations were just new directions. But with 9, 10, 11 it seems the rationale is that the new personality is based on the condition of the regeneration. We can assume 9 was straight off the time-war, just spent who knows how long fighting Daleks with Time-Lords, then had to betray them all. So 9 is really Alien, something Ecclestone did wonderfully, like he kind of remembers humans, but not perfectly. And he's very war-like, think of him beating the Dalek with a wrench and waging war on the satalite. 10 Regenerated after fighting the Daleks, and completed his regeneration in the midst of battle, and his first season he was a lot more angry.

**What is the absolute worst thing you have seen a human being do to another?**


Not personally but I have seen training pictures and videos of child abuse, beatings etc, and that is horrible. Fortunately I have not experienced this first hand but I imagine it would be hard to control my emotions. Personally I have seen some very bad beatings and nearly saw a murder but fortunately she had escaped before serious harm could be caused.


**What is the most bizarre/out and out weird arrest you have seen/performed/heard about?**


One of the best stories I heard, although I can't vouch for it's validity, was an officer called to a man having sex with a pig. He knew it was an offence but couldn't remember the term so told him, ""I'm arresting you for fucking a pig"". This, of course, had to be retold in court leading to him standing in the court room saying this to judge and jury.

**In your opinion what can we do to reduce the violent and dangerous drunken behaviour on city streets at weekends?**


I think the biggest issue is irresponsible drink prices, especially around student bars (Sorry students!). Another issue is that when people do something due to being fuelled by alcohol there should be more ability to prevent them being drunk in public or causing a nuisance.

A university education *should* be elitist, you want your best people to be highly educated. Not every is capable of doing a degree and as the [drop out rates](https://spreadsheets.google.com/a/mobysoft.com/pub?key=rjOlMfz31BnVzx0HcijtiBg&amp;single=true&amp;gid=0&amp;output=html) show that those who attend less academic universities (i.e. many of the former polys) the drop out rate is notably higher. 

&gt; then surely the solution is to target standards

I agree, but then I don't think everyone will necessarily meet those standards without grade inflation.

&gt; However almost all degrees teach critical thinking and self motivation.

Evidence?

&gt; Stories about David Beckham studies [...]

He may have value in being studied but the question is more should we have a degree level subject in something like that in the first place? 

Whilst I am sure Mr Beckham will show up in cultural references for many hundreds of years to come I doubt he merits an entire field of study. 

&gt; Ultimately spending 3 years studying the effects of hip hop culture on South Asian attitudes to women is still better than spending them dossing around watching Dave.

I those are pretty interchangeable.

On the first point, it does affect us if the Eurozone becomes more unified, because it calls into question the decision making capability of the EU, and the integrity of the single market. But the influence we are trying to have on Eurozone unification is to encourage, not discourage it. So those issues only arise if we get our way.

The policeman arresting me even apologised for arresting me for such a tiny amount but they had been told to arrest anyone for even the slightest infraction (I don't know why).

Anyways, after 6hrs in a station across the other side of London (all the local stations were full because of this operation), I was finally given a caution.

I was told that this caution would stay on my record for 5 years and then be gone.  On my last Enhanced CRB for my previous job - the caution showed up (my only caution ever).

I have since been told by some police members that it should have been cleared by now, others have told me the rules changed and cautions stay on for life, and others have told me that even cleared cautions show up on an Enhanced CRB.

Any idea which is correct?  Should I try and get this caution removed from my record since it is 10yrs old?

My CRB says ""possession of a controlled substance(class b)"".  Like I said, it was such a tiny amount as to be useless - it wouldn't get a spider high - but since the CRB doesn't give indications of amounts, it gives the impression it could be a much higher amount.

In my previous job (forensic mental health support worker) the caution didn't matter, but I'm applying for a job at an agency doing IT tech support for the MOD so would like to be able to get this caution off my record if possible.

Edit: I previously applied for a civilian job at the Northumbria Police HQ in Ponteland as a 999 operator and was turned away because of my caution.",0,1319469435,null,0,true,0,c2u0z5n,t3_ln18b,t1_c2u0z5n,t3_ln18b,1427775792,9,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,9

Yes and no. I get annoyed at people who don't understand what the police face passing judgement about an entire group of people. I also get annoyed at certain officers whose actions cause the first group to react the way they do.

**The topic of the ""blue wall"" comes up a lot on reddit, do you personally work with any officer who you think has acted unethically?**

Fortunately I have not been in a situation where I have had to deal with an officer doing something unethical or illegal. We also have a good method of anonymously reporting abuse or unethical behaviour within the job so I feel confident I could report it if needed.

I have no personal experience with the IPCC investigating myself or my colleagues so I can't really comment on their effectiveness. See the above answer for investigation within the force.

I generally feel very positive towards the police, any individual officer I've ever met has been friendly, and on the handful of occasions when I needed to summon help from one, absolutely fantastic, so I generally view police by default as being upstanding and 'there to help' - but you don't need me to tell you that not everyone shares my perspective.

Many American police departments don't even have them or they ""investigate"" themselves. It is really shocking and entirely unsurprising that so many abuses are reported out of that country.    

I think the other thing is that UK police seem to have a different ethos. I really enjoy the whole ""Policing by consent"" concept and I think it works well as a style of policing. In the US it is more authoritarian, almost military.    

I think you should feel proud to be a policeman in this country. I think you guys are a good role model and do a good job.

true,sammyslug,cnty-england,Police Officer AMA!,"I think the majority of cops all over the world are the same - trying to do a good job in difficult circumstances.

For whatever reason I think the police in the UK view the public a little differently. ""Policing by consent"" is often described as the way we work. As is well known we are not regularly armed and have to deal with situations which we could be overrun with, but we police for the community and hope our actions mean we have support of those we serve. This changes the way we behave.

I have no real experience of other countries policing, other than what you see on TV, and whilst I sometimes think the way other countries deal with criminals could be better I prefer the UK model in the end. I know that if I am suspected of a crime I will be treated fairly and dealt with appropriately 99% of the time - no matter what the crime is. I can have a lawyer, maximum detention time pre charge, food drink and a clean bed (or cell). I'd rather that than the alternative.

As for the purpose? That has changed slightly from when I joined but now I see it as I do my job to help those who need help, whoever they are.

&gt;""Why should we have another?""  

It serves to build buttresses around democratic principle, and it's not 'another', the first one was on the EEC which us much different to the EU.  Also, unless someone was born in the 50s they didn't even get to vote in the EEC referendum.  That's right.  Nobody in the UK born in the 60s, 70s, 80s or 90s, or anybody who is yet to have a 50th birthday party, has ever had such a referendum.

&gt;We should not have one just because a vocal minority don't like the EU

'Vocal minority' in the last UK European election voted in a Euro sceptical party in first place, a positively anti-EU party in second place.  And, I'd argue, that a vocal minority is ample reason to have a veto if a vocal minority can provide an argument of why it wouldn't be detriment to the whole but emancipate a few, much as I'd have argued legalisation of marijuana and gay marriage.  Membership of the EEA but not the EU certainly covers that, however one my fall on the argument.

&gt;you cannot govern the country by referendum.

Given that the UK can leave the EU and still be a member of the EEA which guarantees freedom of movement for goods, persons, services and capital, that in return it would get consultation powers on single market policy, would receive a personal veto on all single market policy and directives (which it currently does not have), would regain 100% control of its agricultural and fishery policy, would gain a seat at the WTO (which it currently does not have), be able to set up its own trade and quotas and would save from membership fees, CAP and CFP contributions, saving â¬103 billion over six years, every six years and growing (and that's before the weight of the recent bailouts is budgeted for, or indeed that impending with Italy and France), my question is this...

Needless penalty, maybe, but it was also embellished and he was on the receiving end of the exact same shove before he shoved the QPR player. So I'm not willing to fully blame him for this one, despite admitting that he can give some rash penalties.

I purposely put an N.B. in there as fly paper to that sort of comment.  Here it is again,

                 N.B. The UK would get the veto in mention with
                 regards to themselves because EA council members,
                 Norway, Iceland, Liechtenstein, do. They can veto
                 whether they themselves will adopt a directive 
                 through the EEA Joint Committee.

&gt;The EEA Joint Commitee veto has never been used by the member nations. 

Great stuff!  So you recognise not only do they have a veto but that the EEAJC also has a say in how EU directives can be *'interpreted'* by the EEA parties.  The directives that apply only apply to the single market and the likes along the Four Freedoms - but where they do apply they can reinterpret and even veto as part of the EEA.

&gt;They'd rightfully tell us to get fucked.

See, you seem to think the veto is of a whole for the EU.  It's not.  The directive still passes in the EU it just doesn't carry to the EEA state in question.  They won't tell anybody to ""get fucked"".  They'll still be able to do it in their own EU countries.

Noticed you didn't answer the question though, so I'm still left waiting.  Here it is again,

The Seal is named after the man who pretty much created Time travel for the timelords. It holds a special place in their society. For me it just represents something that I may need to always remember, something that is eternal to me. 
The words I was thinking would be either in a typewriter style font, or something else that is fairly simple. I don't like all the extra stuff done with tattoo letters these days. They'll be one word above, one below in black.  The symbol itself may be colored in a way that it looks like the colors are chasing each other around the symbol. (If that makes sense.)

How did it change my view of the world? I have always had this sort of neutral outlook on humanity, for whatever reason. People didn't really matter to me I suppose. Getting into the series I thought it was interesting how much the Doctor cared about each life he encountered when he had no reason to. He had empathy for each and every life, and considered them all precious. It was a victory for him when his enemy lived, and it was a victory when everybody lived. It made me realize this fictional alien character was better at being human than I was.

The EEA members themselves pay for the upkeep of the single market, the four four freedoms.

I've personally had a very very mixed experience with the police, some have been absolutely spot on yet others have had a real attitude problem, and it's not hard for me to see why in some circles there's a lot of hatred towards the force. I'm worried that some individuals feel that their power trip is justified because they think it's for the greater good. This is bound to create more friction between the public and the force, and be a self escalating problem. What do you think?

Also, how do you feel about knives? I personally think that a knife is a very useful/important/beautiful tool, but obviously our knife crime culture is fucking it up for the rest of us. Do you think that our problems could be solved with a change in our cultural mentality, if we learned to think of knives as a tool instead of a weapon? I plan on raising any kids I have around knives and teach them proper knife safety from a young age. Your views?

I have referenced in other comments how some people will have no interaction with the police, save for them saying there is nothing that can be done in relation to an incident against them, giving them a speeding ticket or for any other reason negatively dealing with them.

It is the nature of the police that we only tend to deal with people when their lives aren't going very well.

For that reason, many in the job think, the ""lower"" classes see us an enemy who must be fought against as we are agents of the state. The ""upper"" classes see us as a necessary evil which they are happy to know is there but would prefer they never see.

It places us in an interesting situation and means that the one officer who deals with someone could affect their entire view of the police for the rest of their life, for they may not see another police officer again.

I have met many brilliant people from all walks of life, ""lower"" and ""upper"" class. I have also seen the worst of humanity in these classes and feel there is no real view held of the police, more a collection of anecdotes held, some positive and some negative.

Those who have had a negative experience tend to go into another encounter thinking it will be negative as well and this, rightly or wrongly, changes the way a lot of police officers will deal with that person. Perpetuating their beliefs.

I try in my job to change people's views on the police and like to think I present an image of someone who is supporting the majority of the public rather than fighting against them. It doesn't always work but I enjoy my job more when I leave people shaking hands rather than slamming a cell door on them.

With regards to knives I feel you are correct. What used to be accepted as a handy tool which people were encouraged to carry around with them has now been demonized due to the way they are used. Unfortunately this was a necessary action though, as the way they are being used *is* scary. I do believe we need an offence of carrying a kinfe in public with no excuse because, frankly, there are people I do not want going around with a knife on them.

Until we stop people beating each other up, unafraid of repercussions, and thinking they can get away with murder because they are in a gang and there is safety in numbers I believe this legislation should remain.
