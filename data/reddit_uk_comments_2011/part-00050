true,palehorse864,null,null,"I imagined a Cold War scenario where the Doctor goes to Russia and must stop a Nuclear Missile launch (Initiated by some alien force trying to turn the cold war hot) from beginning world war 3. One missile gets launched though and the Doctor must use the TARDIS to stop it.  He drags it to a halt, but it is still going to explode over Russia, so he drags it through the time vortex looking for the nearest place to drop it. 

As it starts to go critical, the Doctor finds the nearest time off-ramp and exits with the missile. It's now directly above the TARDIS, and before the Doctor can see if he has dragged it to a safe area, the full nuclear blast goes off right on top of our favorite blue police box.  As the explosion clears, the TARDIS is still hovering where it was when the explosion went off. The Doctor clears away the radiation and opens the doors to peak out.

Fortunately, the bomb went off in an unpopulated area The TARDIS hovers above a grove of trees, all flattened to the ground in the direction of the blast, save for one little group of standing trees that were shielded from the blast by the TARDIS.  The Doctor surveys the damage and comments.

I think 'who she is' is coded better for a British person to understand, seeing as they would be able to identify and characterize their working class easier. For me, there was never any ambiguity about what RTD was going for with Rose- the 'common' girl hopping around the universe with her mad time traveller. That was fine.

What made me hate her, was how much she was pushed into being 'special', and her development towards a universe hopping lovestruck badass always felt inorganic to me, and strayed too far into the territory of fanfiction style character decay. Badwolf was the beginning, and after that, she seemed to swing rapidly between being smarter than the Doctor and dumb as a post.

I was glad to see her go in season 2, since there was never much depth there, and I had a wearying impression of her character, and by the time she was gobbing from various screens in season 4, I had no qualms about wanting her GONE. Donna was infinitely better as a 'ordinary girl travelling the universe' and Amy's story is brilliantly concieved,  hooking into her childhood and her whole life, but allowing her to have her own personality traits that made the Doctor like her in the first place, her bravery and imagination.

true,cybermuffet,null,null,"See, Rose is actually my favorite of the modern companions. I love her *because* she's a chav. I love her lack of A-levels, I love her 'f's where 'v's should be, I love her hoodies and hoop earrings, I love her perpetually clumped mascara. They're markers of her cultural background, and reasons why a lot of people in society would dismiss her. 

I disagree that she was a ""cheerleader"" companion. Cheerleaders are usually the advantaged girls, the ones from upper-middle-class homes. She's somebody people would tend to immediately dismiss because of her background, who probably wouldn't have had a shot at anything other than being a shop girl because people would have taken one look at her and decided who she was and what the limits of her potential would be. But the Doctor's an alien, and didn't know enough to judge her. But she was brilliant (it was clear from the second episode that she was inherently a thoughtful, philosophical type), clever, brave, silly, joyous, and incredibly warm - and the chav from public housing won the heart of a Time Lord.

If you think about it, that's pretty damn subversive. How often do you see characters like her on TV who aren't either ""tough, bad girl"" types, or objects of ridicule? The moment when Queen Victoria dubs her ""Dame Rose of the Powell Estate"" is, however anachronistic it might be, absolutely fantastic. Can you imagine an American TV show in which someone was dubbed ""Dame So-and-So of XYZ Housing Project""? And this is in the UK, where class judgments and expectations are even more entrenched than they are here. 

I adore Billie Piper's performance - she's got depth, fire, and complexity, and screen presence to burn. Holding your own onscreen with Tennant's no easy task, and that kind of weight is rare for an actress that young and inexperienced. 

And yes, I even love her relationship with the Doctor. Yes, part of that's because I'm a total romantic and habitual shipper. But BP and DT also have such lovely, giddy, fizzy chemistry together. She had great chemistry with Eccleston too, but when he regenerated, the temperature between those two immediately rose so high that it almost wouldn't have been believable if the writers had ignored it. I think the two characters go wonderfully together. And, as I said, I love the subversiveness of the Last of the Time Lords falling in love not with the privileged, classy, well-dressed, well-educated medical student, but with the chav from the projects.

EDIT: I also don't think she was a MarySue. If she was, she would have gotten the Cinderella/Pretty Woman/Working Girl makeover somewhere along the way, and the fans probably would have liked her better for it. Not Rose. Her mascara was clumped on when she was running from evil plastic, and it was clumped on when she was dropped off in Bad Wolf Bay with Ten2. Fantastic!

Which it is, but that is still not making it a majority and nothing I've said has done so. It's your inference which is making it so.

&gt; And you always do this when questioned too; you start off saying something incredibly divisive and then back down to a more moderate position when questioned. It's so fucking disingenuous.

And what is diversive about saying it is a problem which does exist? I'm not backing down from that statement either.

&gt; I'd argue that it is less common to be irresponsible about rent amongst people in social than in private rents, because private renters can just move on to the next slum landlord if they lapse in rent, whereas on social you lose your future right to housing.

It is incredibly hard to evict someone from social housing, you can run up arrears of thousands before the courts take the problem seriously. And even then it is often just a case of paying arrears off at a tiny rate over a long period of time. It is far easier to be evicted from private housing than it is to be evicted from social housing, people know that and tenants will play the system.

&gt; Do you have any figures to compare the two and prove differently? Of course you don't because you are talking shit, based on nothing but anecdote and designed to make people angry towards people unfortunate enough to need social housing.

Do you have any figures you can use for your argument? Or is it just based on shit you've gleaned from papers? Because what your saying about social housing is very different from what people who work in the sector are saying. 

As for making people angry towards those in social housing, why would I do that? I live in social housing.

And the point is bullshit, the double negative being its only merit.
Production means using human ingenuity (brains, machines, dexterity) to transform some raw material such that there is a useful finished product.

Banks are meant to be efficient conduits for channelling capital so it can enable production. This claim of being 'producers' is just MBA twaddle at best, self-serving smokescreens to disguise the total lack of efficiency (or theft) at worst.

I have for a long time noticed with some amusement the bankers' attempts to portray their trade as being sophisticated. E.g. the claims of employing the 'best and the brightest'^1 , to appropriating terms from the sciences for shady practises^2

If the changes to the education system simply do not happen for whatever reason (which given the record for government reform speed is possible) then we've got what I consider a problem.

What we've done is effectively promoted turning EMA even further into 'the dole for kids at school' and I'd be concerned about the stigmatising this process causes. It's self evident that this process is being done to cut the cost of EMA, and the method of that is the principle of 'less eligibility'. In this manner, it potentially singles out recipients as being 'poor'. 

As adults, the majority of us can say easily that we're not bothered because we know we need the money and whatnot, but if you're 16 - 18 and you're bothered about popularity and how 'cool' you are, you might intentionally struggle through and refuse to receive money and the product is your education suffers.

First, the assumption that something has to be 'old' to be vital. For some people, it really could be. As it stands, I feel they should have saved the EMA changes until they had altered the education system. It's not guaranteed to happen and if there are delays, we're creating potential black holes with regards to teenagers who may drop off the radar because they needed EMA to attend a college.

Second, you dismissed hardship grants at university and stigmatisation of them with anecdotal evidence. I know two people who should have applied for one and refused to because they didn't want people to think they were crap with money, even though for one of them it wasn't their fault. Equally anecdotal, but there are people who hate being scrutinised and will write off needing something as being just them overreacting.

I don't know if anyone knows people who do this, but if application forms for benefits or whatnot have to be collected in person rather than delivered to someone's house, there are some people who would rather do without because they don't want to be perceived in a negative light as a scrounger.

true,hewhoknowsnot,null,null,"It would and it's nice and very possible, there's a few things that would have to be dealt with though (and they pretty easily could be if this is the solution Moffat has for it):

1) The Ganger Doctor doesn't have any means to time travel and he is in the future of the point where he has to be in order to die (2011) but I don't think he was far enough in the future that they had time travel yet - maybe though, I'm not sure

2) The Ganger Doctor has no idea he's going to die or when he's going to die (it was the real Doctor who Amy told in The Almost People). So somehow he'd have to find this information out to make all the preparations that were made (envelopes, locations, etc)

3) The Red Herring, it is a nice theory but maybe just a little too nice. I know that's a weak counter-argument but it's just a little too convenient and I'd think Moffat might have put it in there so people jump to this conclusion when it's actually something else

4) The issue of showing the Ganger Doctor do all the things brought up while still focusing the show on the real Doctor, it would be a little tough - but I guess a flashback or something could be done

5) This is also assuming River lied to Amy and Rory when she scanned the Doctor's dead body (which is possible but something you have to recognize that she's doing in your theory)


On the other hand, it would make sense simply for the fact that there's no way they can show all the little River-Doctor stories so it would work because this way the Ganger Doctor and River can have adventures without us ever seeing them.

&gt;1) The Ganger Doctor doesn't have any means to time travel and he is in the future of the point where he has to be in order to die (2011) but I don't think he was far enough in the future that they had time travel yet - maybe though, I'm not sure

Eh, that's pretty simple. All Ganger Doctor has to do is get his hands on a [vortex manipulator](http://tardis.wikia.com/wiki/Vortex_manipulator). Jack Harkness, former agent of the Time Agency, has one that can be re-activated by a sonic screwdriver (which Ganger Doctor has), and River Song has has one she about as stolen goods. Plus all those 51st century [Time Agents](http://tardis.wikia.com/wiki/Time_Agency) gallivanting around the timeline have one as well. Easy enough to say that sometime during the next 200 years Ganger Doctor encounters a vortex manipulator. 

(Actually, if my theory is accurate, Ganger Doctor's age could be in question. If it's the Ganger Doctor that says he's 1100+ years old, ~200 years older than our original Doctor, he could be counting the original Doctor's 900 years . . . or he could be counting 1100 years *since he came out of the Flesh*. So Ganger Doctor could have been knocking around for over a millenium.) 

And if Ganger Doctor really needs a TARDIS, well he could maybe build a [junk TARDIS](http://tardis.wikia.com/wiki/Junk_TARDIS). All he needs to do is find the location of [House](http://tardis.wikia.com/wiki/House)'s body. Well, that, and figure out a way to power it. 

&gt;2) The Ganger Doctor has no idea he's going to die or when he's going to die (it was the real Doctor who Amy told in The Almost People). So somehow he'd have to find this information out to make all the preparations that were made (envelopes, locations, etc)

He's got 200+ years to figure that out. Heck, *I* could probably figure that out in 200 years give or take a few. :-) 

&gt;3) The Red Herring, it is a nice theory but maybe just a little too nice. I know that's a weak counter-argument but it's just a little too convenient and I'd think Moffat might have put it in there so people jump to this conclusion when it's actually something else

Yeah, sure, might be a red herring. Might not be. I suspect only Moffat knows for certain. 

&gt;4) The issue of showing the Ganger Doctor do all the things brought up while still focusing the show on the real Doctor, it would be a little tough - but I guess a flashback or something could be done

Right. Because *Doctor Who* has never take on narratively complex storylines before. :-P

&gt; 5) This is also assuming River lied to Amy and Rory when she scanned the Doctor's dead body (which is possible but something you have to recognize that she's doing in your theory)

Well, I'd have to go back and re-watch that episode because I don't remember exactly what River said, but it's quite easy to believe that whatever scan she performed was unable to distinguish a 200-year stabilized Ganger Doctor from the original Doctor. So she doesn't have to *lie* -- it can be explained away by just saying that she didn't have the best possible information.

true,Ivashkin,null,null,"On paper at least it is possible to see what they are trying to do, which is to shut down the EMA grant and increase funding for colleges and schools to hand out bursary's. But given how fast things are moving I don't know how well that will work out. They do need to make it clear to students that they can apply for these grants if they need help, as our university hid it's scheme away on a website and never advertised it. 

As for the anecdotal stuff, it's anecdote vs anecdote, in my social group we were all pretty shit with money (or seemingly so) and it became normal to talk about applying for it openly pretty much as soon as we figured it out. This will probably vary depending on the social group, location and socio-economic ""air"" of the place/people, and I suspect any remaining pride people have gets beaten out of them by Christmas, year 1 of university. That was the point for me when I first went into my overdraft, and I didn't see black for another 4 years.

For the course at my university I think you just printed some forms off and mailed them back, or handed them in somewhere. It was a large place and no matter where you were it was highly likely that you would be surrounded by people who had no idea who you were and if they should care about you or not. My college was just a smaller version of that. I think the money was a check or BACS, and usually the first thing it was spent on would be alcohol, weed or ""posh"" food, all of which people would take notice of. 

So if you put a little effort into things, and managed to keep schtum about not being broke anymore, it would have been entirely possible to get a hardship grant without the people you were living with finding out.

My understanding of it was that your parents had to submit proof of income for some kind of decision to be made as to your eligibility, and it was graded accordingly.

As to the hardship grants at University - yeah, I can't find any details of it for my University but I know it exists only because I've seen the forms. Not a clue as to how you would go about claiming it. With any luck I'd hope to not need it.

But on the topic of EMA - I understand that people could probably spend it on crap. I understand that you could perhaps show some sense of outrage at this, but... it's like being outraged at someone on jobseekers buying a takeaway and a few pints. 

Don't get me wrong, I'm not one for universal eligibility of benefits except in cases of benefits intended for unemployed/disabled people. What I'm discussing is from my perspective a very real chance that we're potentially leaving one or two years worth of children without the option of EMA funding when we should really have changed the system before removing the support. Even if it turned out none of them needed it, we can't run on assumptions like that.

If all the original claimants were eligible and the eligibility principle remained the same yet the method of acquisition was not, any reduction in cost would mean that people who normally would apply could have been dissuaded by the change in system or the college rejecting claimants in order to top up it's own budget.

I don't know. I don't know quite as much as I'd like about it to make a rational and informed judgement and I'm generally being opinionated and perhaps irrational, but I prefer to suggest caution rather than bullheaded action with regards to any form of welfare reform due to the nature of it.

2) Maybe, if he ran into another [Tesselecta](/spoiler) or something else he could find out. So yea it's definitely possible just a matter of whether they want to go that route

5) I thought Moffat had tweeted in reply to someone asking if it was the Ganger Doctor who died that River had scanned his body and it would have shown up if it was the Ganger.  But now I can't find that tweet so maybe I was mistaken, anyway here's what she said:

River had said after scanning his body ""Whatever that was, it killed him in the middle of his regeneration cycle. His body was already dead. He didn't make it to the next one.""

It seems like when I read about The Valeyard in this sub-reddit people around here think that he will be a direct incarnation of the doctor if he is recognized by The Mof. Look at the language though, ""entity and created."" Also, according to the Master the Valeyard is “the personification of all that was evil within The Doctor.

What if The Ganger Doctor becomes the Valeyard? His apparent destruction did not destroy him but instead destroyed what was good in him leaving the evil part. If the Ganger Doctor truly was destroyed, what if the Doctor is captured and “all that was evil with the Doctor” was copied and imprinted in a new ganger? He could take over the Tardis and destroy it.

We are lead to believe that the Dream Lord is the evil aspect of The Doctor manifest. So what if in a wibbly wobbly... time-y wimey kind of way the Dream Lord is made physical? The Dream Lord is technically The Doctor so he could take control the Tardis and cause it to blow up. Maybe this physical entity whose created is or becomes the Valeyard?

Maybe the Dream Lord is the Master. (Lord and Master having very similar connotations.) The Master converted the Tardis into a paradox machine (this is old enough to not be a spoiler right?) before so maybe he can still control the Tardis and cause it to explode.

Sift past some of the jokes and there are some useful tips in there. Do's and Dont's etc etc.

As for the University, I go there myself, just about to enter my third year, i have LOVED my time there, so glad i chose it. There were recently 2 threads about the Uni (one about the [uni itself](http://www.reddit.com/r/brighton/comments/j78xn/any_university_of_sussex_students/), and one with [general tips](http://www.reddit.com/r/brighton/comments/e5h85/hi_rbrighton_im_studying_at_the_university_of/)). There is a lot of information in those threads, and worth a read through the responses.

If you can get accommodation on campus, i would highly recommend going for it. The social scene at University of Sussex accommodation is brilliant. I met some great people there, and had a wonderful time. 
However, if you can't get accommodation on campus,  (as far as im aware) the housing office will often place you in temporary accommodation (usually lodging with a family in the area) unti a place on campus frees up.

As for things to bring, i wouldn't go wild, just the essentials. If you've forgotten anything, or need to pick up something new, there are a few local shops on campus, and even if you life in town, there are corner shops everywhere. Plus, shopping in the town center is brilliant.

I think that should cover most of what you need. If i think of anything ill post a reply, and if you have any more questions i can help out.

As for questions for you! :P what are you coming over to study?

This is why the Doctor was wearing his tux from Amy and Rory's wedding. Why Mel was not mentioned before now, but has apparently existing through out Amy and Rory's life. (And in fact may have engineered her existence). Little examples of gaps in time where things don't line up.

River could easily be the opposite of the Doctor, an anti-fixed point in time (A wobbly point in time?). Akin, in a limited fashion, to what Rose became in the Bad Wolf entity. Anything involving her timeline may be fractured/altered by her, and ripples out. So she could have killed one version of the Doctor in a future timeline (though we haven't actually witnessed River do it, the time cops could be wrong). And if so she might be able to alter the timeline so he doesn't need to die. But it has to be her choice and actions.

The Doctor still dies in a fragment of that timeline, which we saw, because he's a fixed point his deal must occur in some fashion. But that doesn't mean the Doctor ceases to exist if River alters things. (Watch the scene where River and the Doctor one up each other, operating on a different level of temporal perception)


Of course the other theory I have is that we never actually saw what happened to the Doctor that fell through the crack in time. We saw him beginning to fade out of existence in the Tardis. Then we cut to the wedding where Amy remembers him. Suddenly he was wearing the tux from this episode.

Perhaps when the universe rebooted the Doctor did too, and the Doctor we followed last season will be a ""temporal clone"". A fragment of the previous universe held over and pulled back from non-existence by some future act of River. The version of the Doctor we've been following this season is the Doctor that's supposed to exist in this universe. (much like Rory is now human, but seems to have picked up echoes from the last iteration of the universe)

Therefore the other Doctor dying can happen because he knows he shouldn't be around (and spends 200 years partying). This doesn't actually mean the death of the Doctor. Just the death of the Doctor's ""twin"". (Which no one would know about as the two probably don't travel together through history)

This would mean the Doctor we see die could have been killed by the Doctor we've been following, (in the suit) before he went back to the dinner to meet the gang. Hell maybe the version of the Doctor who died ended up creating the Question and recruited the Silence in the first place in a misguided attempt to save River from a future he didn't know about until it was to late.

Therefore his death was penance for cocking up the timeline and set the universe right.",0,1314818527,null,0,true,0,c2gkq24,t3_k0fzg,t1_c2gkq24,t3_k0fzg,1427542900,15,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,15

The reason for this line of thought is that everything involving the Slience, the Question, Demon's Run, the TARDIS explosion last season all comes back to River. She is a lynchpin of the story and she operates in a different timeline than the rest of the characters. Many times she's responsible for kick starting the events the Doctor has had to fix.

There is a pretty good bus network in Edinburgh but you still have to choose to either live close to campus or live in town or take a bus three miles to both.

UoE's engineering campus isn't exactly [centrally located either](http://g.co/maps/v949), but is much closer than Heriot-Watt.  Unlike Heriot-Watt, UoE is actually distributed across the city with most of the common services (like administration and the main library) in the middle of town.  A lot of Sci and Eng students live just south of The Meadows, around [Marchmont Road)(http://g.co/maps/gprc) or in Newington to the east.  It is a two mile walk to class, a one mile walk to the center of town and about fifteen feet to the nearest pub.

Like adcn19 says, Heriot-Watt an excellent engineering university (I realise that I was a little luke-warm in my initial response), one of the best in the world and probably better than UoE for practice of engineering (although UoE is also good and known outside engineering circles).

Make sure that you do your research before you go and find somewhere to live that suits the experience that you want.  You will want to scope out the bus routes and find somewhere to live that is convenient to get to campus as well as out and about in the city.  If you are there for a single year you want to live in the city center and suck up the bus ride to and from campus every day.

Overall, I'm pretty happy. We don't lose anyone massive, Zhirkov and Benayoun were fringe/cover players at best. The loans for Bruma, Courtois, Kalas, PVA, Kakuta and Davila all bode well for our future. I had hoped we would have completed a sign and loan deal for de Bruyne as well, but I understand the difficulty of agreeing such a thing with a team that we have to play in the CL.

Meireles appears to be a good pickup, but I had hoped for someone a little more versatile, able to replace Mikel or Lampard in the line-up. From what I hear, he's more of a replacement for Lampard, so then just an upgrade on Benayoun. I'll have to see how AVB decides to use him.

Arsenal's having a rough start, but they signed two excellent defenders (Personally, I think Mertesacker is a beast, and really wish we would have made a run at him.  Instead, we get to watch him thrash us for the next five years.) *and* they retooled their midfield.  They're better than us, that's for sure.  Liverpool's back after a down year, and Chelsea and the Manchester clubs were already clearly better than us.
