Under FPTP, people stop voting for small parties, and instead vote for the largest party that they don't hate. This is called tactical voting, and is a major problem with FPTP.

With AV, yes the small vote could still be worthless. However, it will not be a wasted vote. Since the vote will not be wasted people can put the party they really want to win. I fail to see how this is a difficult idea to understand. Even more, I cannot even fathom how this could ever be twisted into a negative argument for AV.

god exists, as a concept. the definition of that concept has, in recent times, been enforced by hierarchical, organised religion.

i don't have any inherent issue with the atheist argument itself, or with those who espouse it; however, in defining itself in opposition to the ""church"" in its idea of ""god"", what atheism actually does is 1. reinforce the church's definition of god, 2. take a rigid and dogmatic stance on its views similar to the posture the church takes in propagating and defending its idea of god.

i personally think that what is actually called for is a change in the definition of ""god"". rather than reject the concept entirely, i feel that god can be successfully redefined using, for example, earlier concepts such as paganism/pantheism, or even using that most beloved bastion of atheists, theoretical science.

similarly, i would be a lot happier with anarchism if it sought to redefine ""government"" as opposed to allowing the ""state"" to define it and then dogmatically opposing the state's definition.",0,1304669083,null,0,false,0,c1sqd7c,t3_h3y24,t1_c1sqd7c,t1_c1sognh,1427124221,0,false,bristol,t5_2r52c,0

I think this is almost right. People do realise the concessions that the Lib Dems made, but the mistake was the the Lib Dems made too many concessions to the Tories (Tory's??) to get into power. Whether this was because too many of their plans were untenable or otherwise. Clegg was either...

1. told by Cameron, that all these plans they had weren't possible because of the state of the country.

2. lied to by Cameron, and is too scared/weak to protest in public about the treatment of his party.

3. paid off by Cameron, not in an obvious way as in a cash bribe, but with power, status and publicity.

There has been far too much ""compliance"" from the Lib Dems. They look weak and have been found out as unready to run the country.

I see what you're getting at, mostly. However... (there has to be a however):

I'm not sure what you mean by atheism defining itself in opposition to the ""church"". Atheism doesn't simply concern itself with one religion - it is a blanket statement. While most people are weak atheists in general, many do recognise that they are actually strong atheists when it comes to certain gods. For example (unless someone proves otherwise, I believe this to be correct) an omnipresent, omnipotent, omniscient deity is a logical contradiction - as such it is technically impossible to rationally believe in such a defined god. That would be most Christians' (and Muslims') god out the window straight away.

As such:

* 1 - It does this by saying ""No, I don't believe in that.""
* 2 - Not agreeing with the fundamental tenant of a belief system = rigid and dogmatic? Really?

Or are you conflating atheism with anti-theism?

And what do you mean by ""the atheist argument"" exactly?

A small example to demonstrate the issue as I see it.

I believe in Bertha the Wonder Fraggle-gimp Badger, the great She beast the sneezed into her woolly pocket and thus the Universe came to be. My family believe in Her, as will my offspring and anyone I educate. You are, until now, an aberthaist simply because you have never heard of the concept. If you tell me that you are an aberthaist now that you have heard of her, are you reinforcing my definition of Bertha (aka my god)? Are you being rigid and dogmatic in your aberthaism when you tell everyone that I'm an idiot and the idea of the Wonder Badger is bollocks, as I shout about her up and down the street?

It could be that I'm getting slightly the wrong end of the stick, but are you working from the notion that *everyone* has to believe in *something* like a god? Personally I have never had such a belief.
 
Whilst I can understand the wish to change the definition of ""god"", why would you want to? The word has far too much baggage associated with it to wonder why we need it in any other context. Why not abandon it altogether, as many of us are of the opinion that the world can function quite well without it?

Surely using that word in areas like science is *really* a way to reinforce theistic views? Look up how certain works of Einstein or Hawking etc are quoted by theists who like to wheel them out to demonstrate that such people believe in ""god"" (and therefore *their* chosen god). Why call nature ""god""? What's the point?

&gt; that most beloved bastion of atheists, theoretical science

This is why I earlier asked whether you think everyone has to 'believe' in something. Are you implying that atheists need something to ""believe"" in and that can only be sated by theoretical/unproved scientific theory? 

Personally I was an atheist before I got out of Primary school, mainly because I was never indoctrinated and was introduced to a number of religions (school in North London = ethnic mix) and I didn't need a god to explain everything in the first place (and I was a keen space nut from an early age, too).

true,brennus,uk,Salford,"These are the best arguments for FPTP in this vote, but my problem with it is that they're all very speculative at best and incorrect, imo, at worst.

1) Speculation: AV won't lead to PR and it's more likely that FPTP would lead to PR.

Citation would be helpful here and I think there's so much uncertainty on this, that I chose to vote ""yes"" based on comparing FPTP to AV in isolation without considering PR. True PR might be such a pipe dream that it's wholly irrational to factor it into *any* decision we're presented with in 2011. Again, I could be wrong, which is why I'd love to see some evidence that could say one way or another how likely PR is after FPTP vs. AV.

2) AV is ""still essentially identical to FPTP because if your candidate doesn't win in your consistency"".

It's a little selfish to think about whether *your* vote is wasted or not. Of course they can still be wasted, but since lower preferences are taken into account until someone gets over 50% win, then it is always a guarantee that *no more than 50% of people* don't get the candidiate they wanted somewhere in their preferences, i.e. their vote didn't tally against the overall winner.

Compare that to FPTP where there is no upper bound on that (think of a silly election with 1000 candidiates where it's possible that each gets somewhere around 0.1% and thus over 99.8% of people's votes didn't tally against the winner).

In summary, I prefer AV for capping the number of wasted votes (and remember it's not like everyone is getting their 5th preference except in cases where the opinion is really divided, which is a situation that requires a lot of compromise in any case).

3) ""The difference between AV and FPTP is too small for it to be worth anything.""

Ok, yes. This would be rational as a cost-benefit analysis in that making a change that has literally zero benefit makes the cost:benefit ratio infinite (or extremely large if the benefit is incredibly small). If this were true, I would agree with you. However, I fail to see how they're effectively the same.

In fact, I also do not accept that ""they're the same"" (or even effectively the same) is even a null hypothesis. The null hypothesis over comparing two different things is that ""they are different in some unknown way"".

Now, you don't say there's *no difference*, of course, but that it's too small to be ""worth anything"". Again, we need to answer a) what is the difference; b) how ""small"" is it and how do we measure size?; and c) how small is ""too small""? At what point is it valid to say we can dismiss it down to 0?

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_instant_runoff_voting_to_other_voting_systems

This suggests a large number of differences mathematically and statistically, so let's pick out even just one example:

Under ""How unproportional are the results?"" on that article, analysis on empirical voting statistics suggest that AV is marginally ""more proportional"" than FPTP. Ok, but the numbers are close. Are they close enough to be declared the same? Or is that marginal gain worth choosing over not having that gain?

Also, I have a source I've lost that claims an estimated 16% of seats would change on average per General Election under AV compared with the 13% now. I'll try to find that source if I have to, but again, is that 3% worth changing to have more voter control? Or is it too small?

My point is that neither of us are really able to say whether the difference is too small to be ""worth anything"" without backing that claim up one way or another. That no evidence is presented does not mean we can default to ""they're too similar"".

My actual opinion is, yes, it's not a large enough reform, but comparing the two systems *in isolation* brings out AV as a clear winner. The main issue is that FPTP is simply not designed nor fit for anything with more than 2 candidates. It does not scale beyond 2 in a way that is insanely obvious if you look at my extreme example of 1000 candidates.

If you have people getting somewhere between 0% and 1% of the vote when there are 1000 people running, you're talking about very small differences that could arguably not be strong enough to declare a winner with statistical confidence. While trying to rank 1000 would be a practical problem for voters (so, yes, the mechanics of marking the ballot paper admittedly do not scale), AV would still produce the candidate with the broadest support in theory. It scales in that aspect.

This just isn't true, don't make the mistake of thinking that the Lib Dems are the SDP, the liberal part of the lib dems, the 'orange bookers' were always Tory lite. The lib dems have been able to play differing tunes to different wards in the past, but now that they're in power they've had to build up a coherent set of nationwide policies which can be implemented and mostly due to the fact of the coalition the conservative side of the party has won out.

true,severedfragile,lfc68,,"I don't know what makes half of these ""potential"" targets, but let me take a look at the list.

Roger Johnson - No. He's good, but not good enough for us to be building our ambitions on. Good squad player but we need better in our starting 11.

Matt Jarvis - This one could be a good buy. Jarvis/Ashley Young would go a long way to giving us proper natural width next season. Not a glamour name, but could still be a good option.

Michel Bastos - Never impressed me, but then I don't know if I've seen him play 10 games. 

Jose Enrique - Looks one of the more likely. Was poor against us, but has been better most of the season. Not necessarily my first choice, but with only a year left in his contract, he could be a good option around £5m-£7m.

James McCarthy - Again, only watched him a couple times. One for the future? Maybe. I don't know. Not excited.

Charlie Adam - I think if we'd bought him in January, we'd have our play set up to get the best out of him now (especially with Torres, Gerrard and potentially Suarez thriving on his long delivery). At the moment though, I don't think he'd fit in with the style of play we've been exhibiting. Also, there's still doubts about whether or not he'd be able to compete at the absolute top level, and considering the strides we've made towards re-attaining that level of play, I don't know if he's a man who's going to be moving us forward like we want. We already own the following players who can handle CM: Gerrard, Meireles, Lucas, Spearing, Aquilani. Is Adam really going to fit in there? If Aquilani returns, this one should be over. If he doesn't, Adam could be useful, though. Gerrard's getting on, and he's had his injury problems.

Connor Wickham - Haven't seen anything more than a few youtube videos so I don't really know. He'll be expensive and in-demand, though.

Niko Kranjcar - I think he'd fit right into our style of play, but not necessarily into our first team. Which is why I don't know if he'll come - after playing so little this season, I don't know if he'll be happy facing more time on the bench. Also doubt Spurs would sell to a direct rival. Still, I'd be happy with him, probably more so than with Charlie Adam.

N'zogbia - Nah. He's kind of a brat. Could be cheap (especially if Wigan go down) but we've already probably got Marveaux coming in as a free winger, so I don't think we should skimp on this area of the team unless we're really strapped for funds. 

Sakho - Don't know much about him, so I'll leave this one. Anyone seen him play much? 

So basically, only a couple players on that list to get excited about (in my opinion) but nobody I'd be unhappy with. I just feel like people aren't really sure what our ambitions are and how we're going to go about with our transfer business, so it's hard to put that much stock in any of these.",0,1304682140,null,0,false,0,c1sqqtg,t3_h5ems,t1_c1sqqtg,t3_h5ems,1427124397,4,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,4

I haven't seen much of Sakho either, but if half the top EPL teams want him, he must be pretty good. I think we'll probably lose out on him to Arsene though as he desperately needs a good CD, and he prefers younger players obviously.

true,whencanistop,eng-GreaterLondon,Greater London,"&gt;anyhow, money is very finite right now - so you simply can't have all the police you want no matter what benefit

That's not how it should work (although it appears to).  If you want to have more police, you can easily raise taxes (or borrow money until you can raise money through taxes).  Clearly the Government has said that we'd prefer to have lower taxes than we would to have a better police force.

&gt;what is the 'social cost' cost of 99 occasions not being able to attend other incidents that are positively identified as need police attention (potentially violent).

I don't know what the social cost is.  That was meant to be part of my point (ie that it is difficult) and that the police have a hared job in deciding which jobs they should prioritise.  However doing a blanket 'No' to all overdosers (for example) if there are police officers sitting around doing nothing doesn't seem quite right either.

&gt;The author makes a very good case for rationally sending police to situations that definitely need them - and cites all good examples. Difficult to see how anyone would have a problem with that?

true,ghostsofaviation,null,null,"no worries, i'm a fan of debate :-)

i'll start with bertha.  having never heard of bertha, i'm not by default an aberthaist - there is no word that applies to me because i am outside of the entire concept paradigm.  my ignorance of bertha is simply that - ignorance of bertha.

however, having heard of bertha and decided that bertha is a load of crock, i am NOW an aberthaist.  but what that means is that i accept your definition of bertha as the wonder fraggle-gimp badger who sneezed into her woolly pocket.  i have accepted YOUR definition, and while i do not agree with it, i have allowed YOU to define the argument.  therefore, no matter what i say against bertha, YOU have automatically won - simply by virtue of the fact that YOU have been allowed to define what bertha is and what she does.  now no matter how hard i argue against bertha, anyone listening to us has to first listen to YOU, to figure out what bertha is in the first place.

as demonstrated above, i believe the primary argument between theists and atheists is one of semantics.  unfortunately, theists are winning because they are being allowed free reign to define the concept of god in whatever way they want.

when i say that god exists as a concept, i'm not talking about ""god"" as defined by theists.  i am talking about a word in our language, which is there whether you want it to be or not.  you cannot simply discard a word from our language because the definition does not suit you.  the word lingers whether you want it to or not.  the reason why ""god"" has so much baggage attached to it is because its definition is flawed.  you CAN walk away from that definition of god - as ""an omnipresent, omnipotent, omniscient deity"" which defies logic.  you CANNOT walk away from the concept of ""god"" - as a word in the english language which has throughout human history been defined in a myriad of ways.

what i'm saying is, even being atheist in relation to ""certain gods"" is problematic, because the parameters of those gods have already been defined.  so, any bertha-like example you give me has the same outcome - the god has already been defined, the argument won simply by virtue of the fact that the concept, whether or not it is actually true, becomes embedded in people's minds before the atheist has the chance to refute it.

the reason for defining ""god"" as the natural world itself - for saying that ""god"", as opposed to being the logical contradiction of ""an omnipresent, omnipotent, omniscient deity"", is, in fact, everything you see and do and think and are, and everything that is not only within the physical Universe but COULD be, or WAS, or WILL be, and even everything outside of the Universe and everything that can and cannot be imagined, and in short infinity that can be explored but not entirely comprehended - is because if you define ""god"" in this way you are able to move past the theist/atheist argument and behold the Universe itself with the reverence it deserves to command.  you're no longer stuck arguing in logical circles using a flawed definition of deity - if you define deity as the natural world such arguments lose all potency and you no longer have to even focus on or think about the theist definition of ""god"".  THAT is true victory.

and my ""bastion"" comment was a dig at the zealous way that i've seen some hardline atheists defend empirical science.  don't get me wrong, i'm generally a fan of empirical science, but using it to attempt to prove or disprove a semantic concept is amusing to me.",0,1304688448,null,0,false,0,c1sqzsk,t3_h3y24,t1_c1sqzsk,t1_c1sqo87,1427124514,2,false,bristol,t5_2r52c,2

To be honest I think the problem will get worse before it gets better. As a society we're getting more isolated socially, and more scared as a result. We're also so rarely exposed to any real level of risk that we overreact to even the smallest potential crisis.    

I think the pedo-hysteria is a very good example of everything that is wrong with modern western society. We're scared of strangers (which is everyone), and we overreact to a fairly small risk (sexual predators). The result is that everyone looks like a pedo' through that veil of insanity, and it self-perpetuates.    

I think when the authorities (police, government) see these fears, they try and respond to the fear (rather than the problem - social isolation). Thus fuelling the isolation further. Do you think making it difficult for adults to coach school football teams either results in further social isolation or reduced pedo fear? I'd go as far as to say that it actually worsens the fear.

In regards to 1), you're right, it's completely speculative and I don't know if it's even possible to get any good evidence either way.

Anecdotally, my mother who has nearly two degrees and spent a while as a *[Militant Tendency](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Militant_tendency)* party branch secretary *still* misunderstands AV. My gran has no clue. Neither does my neighbour. I think comparing it to PR would be very difficult for many people. That's what I've experienced; I don't know if other people have had different reactions.

You're right on 2), AV is preferable in that regard (50% of votes counting instead of a small percentage)

&gt; ""comparing the two systems *in isolation* brings out AV as a clear winner""

I also agree here. Really my argument rests on the speculation that AV will harm the chance of PR, and that a chance of PR is better than a certainty of AV. I certainly can see why people would argue the opposite.

But I still believe it to be the case. AV is not the direction we should be headed in. A semi-proportional system such as used in the Welsh Assembly elections of FPTP for 40 seats plus a regional ""top-up"" list (Party-list proportional representation) for 20 seats is a far better system. AV+ would be better still. If there is a stepping-stone to PR, it is options like these.

AV is, I would say, a negligible improvement in proportionality, and a minor improvement in the way consistency votes are counted that is worth rejecting for the (small, but large enough to justify it to me) chance of any more proportional option both due to the message sent by the rejection (that PR is what I want) and because AV confuses people and so is harder to argue against.

The ones you just mentioned are the **best** ones, though I did really like Out of Time and To the Last Man for the whole ""person from the past brought forward"" aspect.  I liked They Keep Killing Suzie (except for Gwen's role in it, she acts like a dumbass).  Kiss Kiss Bang Bang is good if you like the constant ""People from the 51st century want to fuck EVERYTHING"" jokes (and not the classy kind we get with Jack).  Meat is kind of neat, but very disgusting.  Sleeper isn't *bad* but it's nothing special.  From Out of the Rain is okay, too, but would fit better in a half-hour long show.

The thing is, Reset, Dead Man Walking, A Day in the Death, and Exit Wounds (and to a much lesser degree Fragment) are important for Children of Earth.  Not for plotline reasons, but to understand where the characters are when CoE begins.  Plus the first three have Martha Jones in them and she's *excellent* in Torchwood.  I much prefer her cameos here to DW Season 3.

If you don't want to watch Reset, Dead Man Waling, and A Day in the Death, here's the important bits for character purposes: [Reset: Owen is killed.  Dead Man Walking:  They use the second Resurrection Gauntlet on him and accidentally bring him back forever.  But not like Jack, Owen is literally a zombie but with his own mind.  Owen angsts about being dead.  He can't eat or drink or have sex.  He hurts himself a few times which sucks because he can't heal.  Also, he is possessed by some evil thing and becomes King of the Weevils.  The possession bit gets better.  A Day in the Death: more Owen angst about being forever dead.](/spoiler)

As for Fragments/Exit Wounds, the important character bits are that [Owen ends up locked inside a nuclear reactor that's about to meltdown and Toshiko talks him down so that he can accept dying for real calmly.  And simultaneously she's bleeding out on the floor of the Hub (she doesn't make it).  That's why only Jack, Gwen, and Ianto were in the DW Season 4 finale.  Also Jack gets buried alive for a couple thousand years by his crazy brother, but he comes out of it pretty much the same as before as far as we can see.](/spoiler)",0,1304740980,null,0,false,0,c1ssq5z,t3_h5dny,t1_c1ssq5z,t1_c1ssl6m,1427125489,3,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,3

102 hours, 45 minutes and 40 seconds.

The Apollo 11 spacecraft was launched from Cape Kennedy at 13:32:00 UT on July 16, 1969. After 2 hr and 33 min in Earth orbit, the S-IVB engine was reignited for acceleration of the spacecraft to the velocity required for Earth gravity escape. 

Lunar-orbit insertion began at 75:50 ground elapsed time (GET). The spacecraft was placed in an elliptical orbit (61 by 169 nautical miles), inclined 1.25 degrees to the lunar equatorial plane. At 80:12 GET, the service module propulsion system was reignited, and the orbit was made nearly circular (66 by 54 nautical miles) above the surface of the Moon. Each orbit took two hours. Photographs taken from lunar orbit provided broad views for the study of regional lunar geology.


The lunar module (LM), with Astronauts Armstrong and Aldrin aboard, was undocked from the command-service module (CSM) at 100:14 GET, following a thorough check of all the LM systems. At 101:36 GET, the LM descent engine was fired for approximately 29 seconds, and the descent to the lunar surface began. At 102:33 GET, the LM descent engine was started for the last time and burned until touchdown on the lunar surface. Eagle landed on the Moon 102 hr, 45 min and 40 sec after launch.

&gt;A Hausa tale from the north of Nigeria has certain details similar to Aesop in its treatment of ingratitude for favours rendered. A farmer hides a hunted snake by allowing it to creep up his anus. When the snake refuses to leave its comfortable quarters, a heron helps him to expel it. The man then asks how to neutralise the poison that the snake has left and the heron tells him to make a medicine of six white fowl. The man ties it up to make the first of his victims but his wife frees it. On leaving, the heron pecks out one of her eyes.

true,[deleted],null,null,"That's lovely, but doesn't take into account how much of Scotland's GDP comes directly from Westminster, you can't just take one section of a country and expect that if it were isolated it would continue to perform in the same way.

In 2010 the CPPR at Glasgow University carried out a review of how Scotland would fair if it were independent, the full report is [here](http://www.cppr.ac.uk/media/media_142698_en.pdf) but the [Scotsman](http://www.scotsman.com/news/Scots-political-parties-39not-playing.6755436.jp) sums it up pretty well.

Effectively the problem for Scotland is that you can't let an economy rely entirely on a dwindling supply of oil and expect everything to work swimmingly, Scotland would inherit at least part of the UK's debt, this combined with a weak oil based economy would most likely lead to a drop in the country's credit rating. Without the massive UK economy (lets not forget that the UK is the worlds 6th largest economy (not per capita)) to back it up, Scotland would basically rely on bailouts and investment from the EU (assuming it joins), which I guess could work out fine (like in Poland), but cuts would have to be made first.

I don't really give a hoot whether Scotland goes it alone or not, it doesn't really make much difference to the rest of the UK, and if the Scottish want it they can have it, but if it ever happens Scotland will have to actually have to wake up to the fact that things will be worse alone.

true,Talonwhal,null,null,"Problem: Having more than 2 choices introduces the same problem that FPTP has.

If you have 2 systems that are similar then you will get the vote split between them. A system which stands more on its own can more easily gain a majority

Eg. Even with these 4 choices, FPTP could win (with, lets say 30%) even though 70% of people might prefer *any* of the other 3 choices over FPTP - but unfortunately they all got 23% each... uh-oh.

And this is the problem with FPTP - every option is not exclusive or equal, which is why it fails mathematically in the first place. AV always gives a better or same result, it's pretty simple math... the fact that we got a ""No"" just means that either we have a country full of dunces who can't add up or they simply never really considered what they were actually voting on and instead bought into party politics and a few cheap lies from either side which completely drowned out any logical arguments about how the 2 systems work and more importantly *why* AV works like it does.

I think the majority are capable of understanding, so I'd say that people simply haven't understood and simply let their hatred and/or like of various politicians define their choice. Even people who've read a bit about how both systems work and how they're counted up don't seem to have made the connection that the way AV works like it does it that it gives an end result that is a better representation of voters.. themselves... why the fuck would someone vote against having their views fairly represented?!?!?

The discussion on Reddit right here exemplifies this, I don't mean to be offensive but you clearly have not properly considered the math behind it. *Every* flaw that AV has is also a flaw in FPTP - and meanwhile AV has some small benefits over FPTP.

I'd like to know which study you read which lead to your opinion on this.

Funnily enough the Yes and No campaign both claimed the other will lead to more coalitions in the future - and they're both wrong (cos theyre lying fuckers) but they're also both right (in that we will end up with more coalitions in the future with either system).

We could quite easily end up with coalitions for the next 50 years anyway with FPTP - but you know (sorry for repeating myself) the big fucking difference with AV? Is that we'd have coalitions that we WANT in power rather than coalition that we DON'T WANT, because AV will always give a fairer representation.

And onto coalitions themselves... your ""lots of reasons"" for being against them are probably all circumstantial too because there's nothing fundamentally wrong with the idea of a coalition. Although I will admit that the UK political system isn't set up well to have a coalition in power, but that's something which can easily be fixed if we stop being scared of coalitions and realise that they are a fact of politics - and as I said not just AV, we're likely to have plenty of coalitions from here on out.

If you voted Labour at the last election, you have nothing to feel betrayed about. They lost, so they haven’t implemented any polices.

If you voted Tory, you have nothing to feel betrayed about. The coalition has implemented a lot of Tory policy, and even the bits of lib dem policy it has put through are not necessarily things a Tory would outright oppose. 

If you voted Lib Dem though, you have every right to feel let down. Tuition fees and NHS reform in particular are policies that Lib Dems are diametrically opposed to. Sure they can point to the things they have done, like lifting the tax threshold, but that hardly excuses them for raising VAT. A progressive party voting to raise VAT! If I had voted Lib Dem at the last election, I'd want the heads of every Lib Dem MP mounted on a stake. 

I didn’t vote Lib Dem though, so I just find their current plight highly amusing.

Now as to your suggested course of action, they can't just withdraw and form an alliance with Labour, for two reasons. 

Firstly, I doubt Milliband would want anything to do the Lib Dems at this point. They're a toxic brand. 

But secondly and rather more importantly, a Lib/Lab coalition would still not have control  of the commons, so they would be unable to form a majority government.

The best hope the Lib Dems have is to stay in the coalition to the bitter end, and hope that by the time the next election is called they're not as unpopular as they are right now. ",0,1304780256,null,0,false,0,c1sugbp,t3_h5ywl,t1_c1sugbp,t1_c1stsnc,1427126301,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

FPTP gives results 40% off what people really want  
AV gives results 35% off what people really want

It seems to me like if candidate A and B are the ""big"" ones, and support swings away from candidate B, to candidates C, D and E - and then B ends up getting more of the vote because their next prefs end up going to B anyway and B wins... well isn't that because B *still* represents what people want better than A?

&gt; People on the side of The People always ended up disappointed in any case. The found that The People tended not to be grateful or appreciative or forward-thinking or obedient. The People tended to be small-minded and conservative and not very clever and were even distrustful of cleverness. And so, the children of the revolution were faced with the age-old problem: it wasn't that you had the wrong kind of government, which was obvious, but that you had the wrong kind of people.

Unless you believe all single-issue movements are started irrespective of their potential success (and, given the self-serving nature of many politicians, this seems highly unlikely), you will see more of them under PR than FPTP.

Whether this is a problem worth caring about is *another* argument, and one that is more opinion-based than his original assertion.

I know a few people who voted No because 'it wasn't the voting system they wanted'. Preferential voting apparently doesn't come into it unless your number one choice is there.

Now, AV wouldn't really lead to the single-issue movements you speak of, although I agree that PR could... so if you see AV as a ""slipperly slope"" towards PR (that it probably is, granted) then I can understand that to a point. Although weighing that against the lack of democracy we have now I'd say democracy is just sliiightly more important than your personal opinion on single-issue movements... and it is democracy which is at stake here... and we've been sucking at it for a long time, really badly.

But onto the *reason* you're against single-issue movements, this is where you totally lost me... I don't see how belief polarization even comes into it. The real result of single-issue movements under PR would be that an MP or two might be in parliament to represent something that a massive amount of the country is concerned with.

For example if we had an MP for the pirate party in parliament, it would force legitimate discussion in that arena rather than having it completely ignored - there isn't even anyone to bring it up as it stands!

This means that real issues which are otherwise ignored can make it to the table.

So where exactly are you making this connection?

Also, I must say that belief polarization is just a lack of critical thinking, which the current political system pretty much fosters - we're fed a massive ""us vs. them"" load of crap which does more to polarize than anything, no matter what happens people find a way to blame the ""other"" party for it...

The one and only planned attacking strategy that I can think of off the top of my head is the long cross to Crouchy at the far post for a knock-down to JD or VDV. It works, occasionally. But we need more attacking moves. 

Other teams seem to have more planning and cohesion going forward. Think of Drogba peeling off his man and running into the channels creating a tonne of space or when he holds it up for Lampard to take a shot from the edge of the area. We need to learn how to pressure teams this way and use a bit of force to wear teams down so that they make mistakes. 

Yes, we make a tonne of chances but they are the random chances that a lot of times our strikers aren't ready for. How many through-balls have we seen going un-answered this season because Defoe or Pav just didn't read it right? It's way too common for us. You can tell Drogba and co work on these moves every week and it seems like we don't.

true,derphurr,k9,K-9,"River Song is clearly the TARDIS especially after this episode.  It explains many of the jokes she makes about Doctor piloting skills, plus why she can make it work, plus why her timeline is weird or reverse time, plus why she says fate worse than death is Doctor not remembering.. 

Plus The Doctor's Wife episode and given River in the last episode, it is clear her story arc is just about coming to an end.

Do you notice the only time she checks out of ""prison"" is when Doctor needs the TARDIS human entity that is River Song, and then she goes back to awaiting his next need.

To further this.. I will point out:
&gt; Doctor said there was only one time he could ever tell her his name (indicating that the Doctor himself, though unsure of details, did have an idea of who she was to him) to which she simply answered ""shhh... spoilers"" before commencing the uplink that would end her life.

This was what future Doctor whispered to River (astronaut) at the lake before he died.  In the 200 years or whatever, future Doctor finds out who he is an sets up the going away party and for some reason has to die, presumably to make way for another female timelord and next years series.

Also.. [1](http://tardis.wikia.com/wiki/River_Song)

&gt;Piloting the TARDIS she jokes that she ""learned from the best""

&gt; her ""graffiti"" on the oldest cliff face in the universe on Planet 1

&gt;River possessed pictures of all the Doctor's incarnations

&gt;River Song had the ability to write in High Gallifreyan

&gt;After the Doctor restored the universe to life, erasing himself in the process, River left her now blank TARDIS-shaped diary with Amy Pond on her wedding day in 2010 so that she could remember the Doctor back into existence.

&gt;Steven Moffat dismissed the fan theory that River is a future version of Amy Pond, or that she is the Doctor's mother.

I have very mixed feelings about him, or I guess how the writers are treating him I should say. He might be my favorite character, but the way they keep almost killing him is getting annoying.

&gt;But this is really irrelevant - I personally don't mind coalitions but this AV vote had nothing to do with them anyway, so I'm sorry you've been lied to but so has everyone.

According to this [BBC projection](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/8506306.stm) under AV the liberal democrats would have got more seats than the conservatives in the 1997 election.  That would have lead to basically a three party system and plus plenty more coalitions in all likely hood.  (Not guarenteed of course but with the added element of volatility I think coalitions are broadly more likely under AV.  Before I saw this projection, I was actually going to vote yes.  

&gt;Is that we'd have coalitions that we WANT in power rather than coalition that we DON'T WANT, because AV will always give a fairer representation.

Under a coalition system the people don't have any say over who is in power.  It all comes down to the wheeling and dealing.  After the last election the liberal democrats could have easily chosen to side with labour ignoring the will of the people who had voted the Torys the largest party.  

&gt;And onto coalitions themselves... your ""lots of reasons"" for being against them are probably all circumstantial too because there's nothing fundamentally wrong with the idea of a coalition.

Fundamentally what is wrong with the idea of a coalition is that you have two heads, two top men, two leaders.  (Or even three of four in some circumstances.  

Now having two bosses can work well if they think alike and have the same goals and aims, or if they're skills complement each other.  But if they are ideologically opposed to each other and hate each other and spend the a lot of their time trying to undermine the other?  Not so much.  

You want the whole government working towards the same aims and you want a leader who'll keep it on track.  Decisiveness is very important when running a country, because otherwise things end up stalled and cancelled.  

Of course in the good times, these are not major deals but in the bad times they are.  You mentioned circumstantial situations so here's my best one.  The continual coalition governments of Weimar Germany were very shit at running the country.  The people wanted strong, decisive government so eventually 43% of them voted for the Nazi party and few complained when that party shut down democracy and took over completely.  The same thing happened in Italy ten years before that with Mussolini.  

I await your response. :)

What isn't known is how much rewriting each episode underwent.  We only found out about the switch after filming was completed (or maybe just underway), but that doesn't mean they waited that long to make the decision.

Now I was expecting to see a different dynamic between the TARDIS crew, since this would originally have taken place after the ""game-changing cliffhanger"" of episodes 7/8.  But I honestly didn't notice anything that would make me think this episode was in the wrong slot, and there's definitely some mysteries carrying over from 1/2 (Schrödinger's Pregnancy and the eyepatch woman).  Were those in the episode when it was at the 9 slot, or were those added after they switched?

More to the point ... will we get answers to either of those mysteries by the end of the spring series (episode 7), or will we have to wait until the end of the fall series (episode 13)?

true,Matriss,tardis,TARDIS,"Oh, Rose…I love Rose.  I know it's popular to hate on her, but I think she's awesome.  Also, using this post as an excuse to harp on about it.

I have this running fan theory (and I might not be original, but oh well) that the Doctor's regeneration is at least partially influenced by the events leading up to his death.  Case in point, 9 to 10.  9 had all this brilliant chemistry with Rose that culminated when he took the Time Vortex out of her.  10 was ""born"" as a direct result of these emotionally-charged actions which is why he is so attached to her (at least for such a long time, since we all know he did eventually move on LOL QUEEN ELIZABETH).

More than the regeneration aspect, though, Rose turned 9 away from his rather violent streak (""It's not the one pointing a gun at me"") and helped him come to terms with his actions during the Time War (however inadvertently).  10.5 is a creature whose first real action was genocide and he has Donna's hot head on top of it all.  10 saw that Rose could do for 10.5 what she did for him and that she would end up happier in the long run anyway.  He pretty much said exactly that at the end of Journey's End.

As for the companion/equal thing, I personally like to think that Rose grew up quite a bit during the gap between Season 2 and Season 4.  As much as I like her, she did have several annoying qualities that needed to be ironed out.  The companions always seem to grow quite a bit in the absence of the Doctor; when confronted with some sort of threat that the Doctor would normally handle they all step up to the plate and usually manage to take care of things.  I think [Word of God](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod) has said that there is no Doctor in Pete's World and so Rose would have had to fill the role to one degree or another (they did contemplate a Torchwood-style spinoff called Rose Tyler Defender of Earth).

So, to finally answer the original post, I do think that they travel as equals.  I can imagine 10.5 attempting to take Doctorlike control for awhile until Rose has to finally point out that she's not an awestruck girl dragged along through time and space, she has a good bit of experience under her belt.  It'd progress like any healthy long-term relationship, fights along the way and struggles, but ultimately it's a great match.

It's not hard to see the state of things especially given that referendums are rare to say the least...

Oh and add on Clegg is parrotting Cameron about the public giving a clear and resounding answer to the question of political reform that he has to listen to....

&gt; can pull out endless examples of ""well this vote would have gone this way under that system"", etc.

And then you did just that.. hehe :P Of course there's no guarantees those votes would have gone that way but I am one for statistics and it does seem likely. However I think AV would make people think a little differently about how they vote anyway and that effect is not taken into account... and this might not happen in the short term, but give it 5-10 years and we'd probably see a slight transformation of attitudes towards the vote in general.

But anyway...! That's kinda irrelevant as an unknown. The point is that if you're picking a voting system simply because you are considering parties and support and whatever that exist right now, then you are in theory saying that we should keep adjusting our voting system based on parties of any given time period *with the goal* of stopping coalitions forming? No? But isn't that what you've just done??

(or maybe you think we should have a referendum to change the voting system every time a coalition looms on the horizon... we can fudge all the numbers a little further to make it a little less democratic just to make sure we get a single party in power...! oh wait, we just did that)

As I said before, depending on the exact situation at the polls, AV and FPTP can lean towards more coalitions (and not just that, but an evolving political landscape that has more up-and-coming small parties can give endless coalitions under FPTP anyway) - so even if we might get more coalitions under AV right now, what if in 20 years the landscape had changed to a point where we are getting more coalitions under FPTP than AV would give? Would you then say we'd be better off with AV?

And you can probably see what I'm getting at here - that I think it's a mistake to even consider something like this when you're picking a system of voting which is going to follow you for decades into the future... because as AV gives fairer results than FPTP - that fairness will remain always, it will stick with us and give us a better democracy for years to come... and whole ""more/less coalitions"" thing could simply go either way.. maybe, maybe not... this No might not even have a single effect on when we do/don't get a coalition, and what did we gain from it? A better democracy? Fairer elections? Nope.. nothing!

Isn't it a bit shortsighted to pick a voting system which harms the very basis of democracy simply based on how you hope the next election will go?

Why so long? Rory asked the Doctor this, and the Doctor replied that they could go get her right away, following back the signal of the bug that was removed from her hand (which Rory was so intently listening to at the time).  ""But then what?,"" the Doctor asked him.  You can't just waltz into the enemy's lair without a plan.  The Doctor had a plan, but it wouldn't come to fruition until the day Apollo 11 reached the moon.  So he had to be patient and wait.  In the meantime, they had the bug and knew that Amy was all right (ish), and she could hang on while the Doctor's plan to kick the Silence off Earth forever came to a boil.

Of course, then there's the theories that while Amy was held, the Silence there time-traveled in some fashion in their own TARDIS-ish device, meaning Amy was there for more than a handful of days.  Or that the aliens did something to her (pregnancy or whatever) which the bug Rory had somehow didn't pick up.  Or that both of these things happened.

I don't really have the time to write it all about again now but in basic summary I said that it seems my argument on coalitions themselves boils down to me saying that compromise != weakness, while you think it is?

Not sure if it is really as succinct as that, but I think in the US politics is so corrupt that it can hardly be compared, with the amount of lobbying and other bs in the mix it's really hard to be objective about the way their system works (imo it doesn't work, anyway :P)

But in Europe we have plenty of examples of perpetual coalition where people are way happier with the way their government works than we have ever been here in recent memory even without coalition... and yea, sure - you can have sucky coalitions, and good ones.. you can have sucky govts without coalitions.. and good ones... so I'm curious as to why you've decided on setting yourself that coalition = bad, is there really a correlation to this effect across the world? I'm not so sure about that... And if there's an inherent problem with coalitions under our political system, then we should really fix that.

And when we talk of ""watering down"" and ""making concessions"", it's always said in a negative way as if there's something wrong here... but really? What do these terms actually mean?

If another party is forcing some legislation to be watered down, then it is because they are representing a lot of people in the country who are of the opinion that this legislation isn't good in it's current state.. until a compromise is reached.

Similarly with any sort of concession it is a reflection of what people want and a way of making the most people happy with what is decided upon.

(again in the US it's kinda broken because a lot of the time concessions are a result of corporate lobbying, and etc. blah blah - it's a problem here too but it's not quite as bad)

Any social group - if it's a marriage, a sports team, a study group, etc. - needs compromise to work successfully and to maintain a happiness across the group rather than be in constant conflict and I fail to see how you can simply ignore this in a social group of millions of people - if anything it should be taken to an extreme!

After all, what good is a strong, decisive government when they've deciding on things that the majority of the country doesn't even want!?!?

1) I feel extremely insulted that they feel I need some sort of ""update"" every episode telling me the backstory.  I've watched Doctor Who for years.  I never needed it before, and I certainly don't need it now

2) I've found that shows like this spread best by word word of mouth.  Most viewers who actually enjoy shows like Doctor Who are introduced to it by people who love the show and think they will as well.  Random viewers stumbling upon it (especially this many seasons into the ""new"" series) are less likely to be actually interested than if someone recommended it to them because they think they will like it.  A five second intro (which completely skews the whole concept of the show, in my opinion) is not going to attract them any more than if it wasn't there (in my opinion).

1. The majority of people in UK are not overtly political - there's a great deal of apathy. Among these people, there was little understanding of the need for electoral reform, and it was  easy for the no campaign to convince them to support the status quo. Much of the ""no"" campaign appears to have explicitly targeted the very thick. That it won is very depressing!

2. Of the politically minded people, a large number of people who would be inclined to support AV are floating but broadly lib dem tendancy voters. There is a *huge* backlash against the lib dems here, because lots of us voted for them in the last general election as a reaction to the two main parties; they then entered government in bed with the tories and sold themselves down the river.

And the stuff that didn't work out (like the poll tax) we quickly got rid off.  Simples.  

&gt;And when we talk of ""watering down"" and ""making concessions"", it's always said in a negative way as if there's something wrong here... but really? What do these terms actually mean?

Watering down means doing less. Our government needs more ideas implemented and more reforms, not less.  So what if some of them are bad ideas and don't work out?  At least we know now and the ones that do work will greatly improve the country.  

Think of Obamas health care plan.  He basically wanted an NHS for his country.  Something every other western country in the world took for granted.  But he doesn't have a legislative majority, so his proposals get watered down and he ends up with a wet fish.  

&gt;If another party is forcing some legislation to be watered down, then it is because they are representing a lot of people in the country who are of the opinion that this legislation isn't good in it's current state.. until a compromise is reached.

Do you really think the republicans were looking out for their consituents interests when they watered down those proposals?  No, they were looking to be negative, looking for something to attack, hating for hate sake.

Did some research myself (I'm '95), so a convenient list:

Reduced social security

Reduced income tax and increased indirect taxes

Encouraged racial tension by allowing Police to search whoever they saw fit (Blacks and Asians, mostly)

Crushing the unions, the miner's strike was a prelude to an incredible collapse in employment in the north. She and Reagan were terrified of communism, but this was towards the end of the cold war.

(The racial tension and intense poverty and unemployment accumulated and lead to the Brixton riots)

Her policies on Northern Ireland still affect the country today by refusing to release political prisoners.

In Scotland she pretty much destroyed the heavy industry labor markets, and tested out the Poll tax there. Mentioning her scaling back of social security again, because she fucked over a lot of people.


tl;dr- Thatcher wrecked most of the industry, changed the taxes to affect the poorer classes more than in the past and social security was minimal.

Her first term of office was the most radical, some amazing changes were made to this country. One of the few policies I agreed with was the dismantling of the Trade Union power grip. At that time, something radical had to be done to stop repeats of ""the Winter of Discontent"", which tore the UK asunder. She radically strengthened the UK's position on the world map, she wasnt known as the ""Iron Lady"" for nothing. 

She then went and completely ruined it in her second term by introducing the Poll Tax, which this country was only right to be highly annoyed about, and I began to lose my respect for her then. Her downfall was the Poll Tax, and some of the crazier ideas she began to get in her second term.

To this day, I have a respect for her as one the best PM's we ever had, especially on the international scene, even Moscow was scared of her! Britain had so much strength internationally with her at the helm. No one in EU meetings would dare argue with her.

true,Marogian,eng-essex,Essex boy in London,"Uh, whilst I agree she did loads of terrible and insanely stupid things (IMO), she did do good things too:

* Increasing interest rates to lower inflation was definitely necessary to stop the economy stagnating. (Inflation went from **18%** to 8%) You must understand how ridiculously high 18% is compared to modern standards. It was absolutely absurd.

* She implemented a very high tax on North Sea Oil which other Governments may have (admittedly speculation) had a hard time pushing through- tax rate of 90% FYI.

* Breaking the Unions. Now this is a problematic point to make, because I'd agree she went about it the wrong way, but it definitely needed to happen in some capacity. For example, before Thatcher reformed the laws it was legal for workers in one factory/mine to picket *another* factory or mine. That's patently absurd. The mines were unprofitable and were only running with Government support. I'm fairly left wing, but I don't believe in the State subsidising unprofitable industries. So, the coal industry needed to be taken off Govt life support but she went about it in her own stupid antagonistic way which is the problem.

Now before you claim I'm pro-Thatcher, if you asked me to make a list of everything she did wrong it would be pretty much everything else.

Her Foreign Policy, her tax policy, her privatisation policies (well some of them were okay imo), her entire attitude to people and society, her NI policy...they were all complete disasters imho.

And she was just a bitch. Watch recordings of her giving speeches/talking to people. I *hate* the way she conducts herself.

Anyway, its all shades of grey. She did some things right, and some things very, very wrong.

She's an extremely polarising figure because a lot of people in the S.E see her as responsible for dragging Britain out of its post-war decline (I'd personally call this more of a regression to the mean sparked by the influx of North Sea Oil revenues which was *massive*), but its also undeniable that financial de-regulation lead to the massive growth (much higher than EU average) in the 90s-late 2000's, which we'd all now accept was too deregulated in some areas.

People in the North (generalisation) see her as a horrible bitch who shut down the mines, the factories and didn't give a shit about people in general and started the whole me, me &amp; profit-driven attitude (laissez faire capitalism with a Randist streak).

Meh.

true,Talonwhal,null,null,"Yeah, I'm well aware US politics is horribly broken as I mentioned, and this is obviously not the example to follow.

But anyway, this whole governing by trial and error thing is in my opinion one of the things that has failed this country so badly - I do understand the logic behind what you are suggesting now though, but I've seen too many of the really bad results it produces.

For example, we've had changes to the education system which have screwed over an entire generation of kids and given them a really low quality of science and other education - sure, they tried it out and it didn't go so well and now what? Now we have 10 years worth of kids who didn't get taught science very well! I don't think that type of thing is acceptable even if it means it can be fixed in the long term by learning from our mistakes (note: this problem still hasn't been fixed!! Apparently we have more important problems than the future of our education! But hey, at least a STRONG decision was made! RAaA!!1)

What I really want to see is *reasoned* politics - doing things that will have benefits for more than a couple of years down the line. The massive problem we have here is the target based culture where we implement immediate ""fixes"" to problems without considering the long term nearly enough. This is what happens when you get a party with all the power who can act on their political whims without having to sit down and seriously discuss things in a logical manner... countries that have more discussion make far less mistakes in the long run even without the trial and error. But we are far too reactionary and nowhere near thoughtful enough - and if we were learning from our mistakes that would be great and at least there'd be a small benefit then, but the majority of time we just implement more quick fixes to patch up the last lot of mistakes.

In essence we choose to go with gut instinct over intelligence. It might feel right to the politicans of the day but I'm not ok with leaving my future up to random chance... What's that you say, mr drugs advisor? You mean there have been studies done and the evidence contradicts what I'm saying!? Oh well, you're fired, we don't want any of your logical reasoning in these parts! :P

Funny you should mention Obama/Health Care though... because right now we have a Tory government who is trying to steamroll the NHS as we know it... and guess what is the one thing that *might* stop this from happening?

http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-13325442

The coalition!

But I'm sure you'd rather David Cameron just go full steam ahead with his plans without them being watered down in the slightest - and then in 10 years when our country is far worse off than it is now we can say ""Hey, that didn't work but at least the decision was made! Now we can learn from our mistakes and blah blah"".

Oh, and this is disregarding the fact that more than 50% of the country doesn't want the NHS fucking with in this way... but we just made a choice against democracy so I guess we deserve whatever shit we get handed now, right? :P

So while in the US you blame the fact that coalitions have to be formed to please the corporate/private interests corrupting politics... while right here in the UK we have private interests which are corrupting majority parties, and coalitions are a way to stop it from happening...

Makes me think maybe coalitions don't really have jack all to do with anything :P",0,1304876907,null,0,false,0,c1szvl5,t3_h5yi3,t1_c1szvl5,t1_c1szbu3,1427128925,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

true,bromf,hartnell,Hartnell,"I will come to Amy's defences.

1. It is about her because she is who we, the audience, who are noticably human for the most part need someone to relate to.  As the doctor says in the Flesh and stone deleted scene, the Doctor NEEDS a companion so he can see the wonders of what is basically his back garden, and Amy does that.  She is curious, unlike Rory, who is slow and does several convincing impressions of Sean Bean with the number of times he has died/erased from time/fake died to escape dream worlds.

The problem with David's doctor is that he was whining about how it was the curse of the timelords so he can not do a whole bunch of things like rewrite timelines or have double scoops of icecream.  Matts doctor does not give a flying fuck, his season is about the re-writing of time and double scoopes of ice cream.  He does not whine about it, he says it ""was a very bad day"" and then he goes back to saving star whales.

2. Amy seducing the doctor, I got nothing, it is frankly out of charecter and I gloss over it, in the same way I do for Kaylee in Firefly or he whole of the Clannad anime (exept for the two one shot specails at the end of the season).

3. Sure she is selfish, but show me a companion who isn't.  Hell even a person, the Doctor is sure a model citizen taking a wrench to a Darlek in episode three.

Don't get me wrong I like Rory, he is a bit of a drag but fun to have.  Amy is brilliant, and the best companion since the revival back in 2005.

If anything River is more selfish, she calls the doctor out when she wants, to do her adventures.

No-one said they would. They might get more votes before being knocked out though, which could later be used to argue in favour of a more representative parliament.

&gt; Essentially it is a system which benefits parties near the center of the spectrum

The current system favours the two major parties, and AV would lead to more or less the same outcome. That is not a problem that AV was designed to fix. AV would just mean that whichever major party did win had the support of the majority of voters (even if that was only grudging support).

&gt; In comparison to PR, it's not a step in the right direction because it is the end of representation which is more important in politics.

Obviously PR is better, we weren't being asked to choose between AV and PR though. We'll never be offered PR under the current system as it'll never be in the main parties interests.

People will always want to blame somebody else for their own failings.  It's human nature.  Thatcher didn't make people poor, people did.  

- Thatcher crushed Unions because the unions crushed the country in the late 70s.  Hospitals were on strike; so too were the bin men and the grave diggers.  The morgue's were literally spilling over.

- Every single mining village that closed down was going to close down anyway  but taking the country with it.  Nobody was using coal fires anymore; trains were diesel, fires were electric, the future was nuclear.  By shutting down the mines that were being propped up by other mines, those that stayed open became the most cost efficient in Europe and remain so today.

- Yes she raised taxes but not out of jolliness, the country was crumbling, she also saved the country 'massives' with the European rebate.  Labour gave that all away and the UK is now the second biggest net contributer yet *the* smallest recipient per capita. Thatcher got a good deal in Europe.  Everybody else was envious.

- With regards to Northern Ireland, whilst they did try to blow her up, it was her protégé John Major that actually made the Good Friday Agreement possible and that secured a ceasefire that would ultimately lead to the IRA denouncing violence.  Tony Blair likes to claim it as his own legacy but he only actually turned up towards the end to sign the deal once most of the hard work had been done.

Kudos to you for looking it up.  Most people I'm sure just accept the peer pressure that Thatcher-Baiting is what's expected of them.  There's plenty that Thatcher did wrong; some industries needed to be sold off and allowed to fail, some things were right to be privatised, but she went too far.  The perplexing thing however is the very first thing Labour did when it got in, and it actually inherited a country very much on the up, was to sell and privatise some more stuff!

People don't hold Thatcher/Major in context.  If they did they'd have to say Tony Blair/Gordon Brown were, with hindsight, a 1000x worse.  In the time the Conservative had it in the 80s and 90s the country did get better.

For some reason, my mind equates the Moffat/Smith beginning as almost a reboot. Never had that with regenerations before (except maybe Baker to Davidson, but old Tom was my first, and you never forget your first).

I totally agree with your extrapolation as well. If the Doctor went through the cracks, then he never existed, so the Time Lords *should* still exist. Not sure if he actually started the Time War, but he did end it by Time-Locking the whole war. I think Moffat is just ignoring things from pre-reboot (his or RTD's, I'm not sure yet), to avoid the whole issue.

There is no denying that, when Amy wakes up with her parents there, she is in a universe where the Doctor (or at least *her* Doctor) never existed. She never went on any adventures, because he never landed in her back garden.

From the moment she summons him back into existence, it all gets a bit blurred, however. 

Just before the Doctor flies into the exploding TARDIS, we have a reality where Rory died. The Rory we now have is nothing more than a Nestene Auton.

In the reality we see during the wedding, Rory is real live Rory, because he never died.

Everything I say from here on is my opinion only, although I like to think it is based on solid logic.

By summoning the Doctor back (while the walls between realities are still soft and blurry), Amy does not bring back into reality the rest of their adventures. If she did, then Rory would again be dead (and she would be marrying a plastic robot), the TARDIS would again have exploded, her parents would again not exist, yadda yadda, unending loop, time paradox, etc. You can't add back the Doctor and her's adventures without adding back the time cracks (as they caused, and were caused by, their adventures).

The problem is (I think) by pulling the Doctor back into a reality in which he *now* never existed, we have the issue we see, where we have two realities in existence at the same time, fighting for dominance - Schroedinger's baby being the prime example (real Rory:baby; plastic Rory:no baby). Same with Rory's memories of 2000 years of guarding the Pandorica. I suspect this is also how we get a space ship and a pirate ship co-existing and crossing into each other in ep 3. Maybe it even explains the eyepatch woman.

true,Whittico,smith,Smith,"I like her.  I don't love Amy, because I can see what the problems are with her character, but we can't love every single character we're supposed to.  

What I absolutely hate is when people say Amy has no real character or personality of her own, independent on what the episode calls for (that she's a Mary Sue, essentially), when she really obviously does:  She's the sexy, ""I know I'm hot and I'll even flirt with myself,"" firecracker redhead that isn't afraid to fight when she has to, and has a sharp tongue when she wants to insult someone.  Other than Jack, none of the companions since 2005 had any sexuality to them, and he was turned up to 11.  Rose and Martha only ever pined after the Doctor, and hardly ever acted on any of it, Rose only doing so after it was too late and with a substitute of the Doctor she wanted.  All Martha did was say he was brilliant and that she loved him.  Donna was the uber-platonic best friend, which is great because she was hilarious and perfect in that role.  

Amy's not afraid to take what she wants, when she wants it, which we hadn't seen before now (again, except for Jack, that loveable bastard).  To that second point, she did almost die and it was just an impulse, and the Doctor says as much in the next episode.  A 900+ years of time-travelling, adventuring alien just means there's a lot more mystery and allure to the guy.  Someone mentioned it before that, weird as it may be, the Doctor was probably Amy's first sexual fantasy, just based on the mystery of the guy branded in her mind.  Yeah, weird, but that moment in her room is more than likely her just acting out on years of that building up.  And to be honest, you really can't blame her.  She's an incredibly attractive woman who acknowledges that by looking at her job, how she dresses, and how she acts. 

Amy is a character that is aware of her sexuality, and acts out on that.  The Doctor being as cool, weird, and mysterious as he is, it makes sense that someone would be attracted to him and might want to jump his bones, so to speak, especially if she'd just almost died.  Does it suck that she's engaged?  Yup.  It could even be possible that there's a freebie five list with the Doctor's name on it (if Rory and Amy are that candid).  Luckily, she doesn't think about the Doctor like that anymore, as evidenced by the shock in her voice when Rory said she thought he loved the Doctor.  Then she calls him her best friend, more like Donna.  The only problem with Amy that I really have is that, like Rose, it doesn't seem like she has any aspirations beyond just hangin' out with Rory and the Doctor.  That's fine, but it would be nice to see her striking out on her own for whatever she wants to do.  Martha was going to be a doctor herself (kinda got derailed by UNIT), and Donna had intended on being anything more than a temp.

Quicker run down of the points made:
1.  Yeah, I would like to find out more about the Doctor, so I agree to an extent.  On the same note as some other people have mentioned, it's a lot about the experience of other people interacting with the Doctor and this is our way (and his) of seeing the wonder of the universe.  
2.  Covered that in the novel I wrote above.
3.  Yeah, but that's human.  It's also Time Lord.  Someone mentioned that.  Just about everyone is pretty selfish.  That doesn't justify the actions, but it does makes sense.

Way, way, WAY tl;dr:  Amy is a one of the only companions who is aware of his/her sexuality, and isn't afraid to act on that when she wants, especially after she had just almost died and tries to bone down on what was probably her first sexual fantasy.  She's not the best companion, but I like her firecracker personality more than I like Rose's pining over loving the Doctor so much, but never actually doing anything.  I like the fact that Amy does what she wants, even if that doesn't make her my favorite.  That said, yeah, I like her.  She's fun.  Also, that BBCA intro needs to die.

I totally agree with your extrapolation. If the Doctor went through the cracks, then he never existed, so the Time Lords should still exist. Not sure if he actually started the Time War, but he did end it by Time-Locking the whole war. I think Moffat is just ignoring things from pre-reboot (his or RTD's, I'm not sure yet), to avoid the whole issue.

There is no denying that, when Amy wakes up with her parents there, she is in a universe where the Doctor (or at least her Doctor) never existed. She never went on any adventures, because he never landed in her back garden.

From the moment she summons him back into existence, it all gets a bit blurred, however.

Just before the Doctor flies into the exploding TARDIS, we have a reality where Rory died. The Rory we now have is nothing more than a Nestene Auton.

In the reality we see during the wedding, Rory is real live Rory, because he never died.

Everything I say from here on is my opinion only, although I like to think it is based on solid logic.

By summoning the Doctor back (while the walls between realities are still soft and blurry), Amy does not bring back into reality the rest of their adventures. If she did, then Rory would again be dead (and she would be marrying a plastic robot), the TARDIS would again have exploded, her parents would again not exist, yadda yadda, unending loop, time paradox, etc. You can't add back the Doctor and her's adventures without adding back the time cracks (as they caused, and were caused by, their adventures).

The problem is (I think) by pulling the Doctor back into a reality in which he now never existed, we have the issue we see, where we have two realities in existence at the same time, fighting for dominance - Schroedinger's baby being the prime example (real Rory:baby; plastic Rory:no baby). Same with Rory's memories of 2000 years of guarding the Pandorica. I suspect this is also how we get a space ship and a pirate ship co-existing and crossing into each other in ep 3. Maybe it even explains the eyepatch woman.

I have another (almost separate) theory concerning the Silence/Silent/s, but I'll leave that for now, as I suspect it will not go down well.

The point is, it's not that series five didn't happen at all, it just didn't happen in the reality Amy/Rory are now a part of. In the time-stream of Amy's wedding (pre-calling the Doctor), it didn't happen. In the time-stream of Amy's wedding (post-calling the Doctor) it didn't happen (yet it kinda did, but not really, but it might still have).",0,1304895704,null,0,true,0,c1t1em5,t3_h6uti,t1_c1t1em5,t3_h6uti,1427129645,11,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,11

Secondly, I'm firmly in the camp that the events of Season 5 did in fact happen, and that while things fall through cracks in the universe, they don't retroactively cease to exist (in spite of what the show actually says). If that was the case, then Amy Pond clearly couldn't have existed in the first place. I'm of the opinion that when things fall out of the universe that they are forgotten entirely but still existed up to that point. 

That does leave the problem of Rory and Amy's parents, which is easily solvable through the same mechanism that saved the Doctor. Amy had ""the universe pouring into her head"" long enough that she was able to bring back not only the Doctor, but her parents and Rory through the cracks.

The silent who says the phrase ""kill us all on sight"" is probably the first alien most people will have ever seen.

true,NotThatOtherGuy,null,null,"You've really stood up for Thatcher in this thread, it's kind of admirable. I'm actually old enough to have lived through the Thatcher years mostly as an adult, so I feel a bit qualified to comment. My feeling is that she did some necessary stuff, and some unnecessary stuff, she was radical, and that will divide opinion always. But she divided this country in a way it had never been divided before, the fact this thread exists alone is proof of that. What good were her successes, when she left so many behind?

The divisions we have now, the gap between rich and poor, the generations on benefits, the shitty public services and infrastructure, they are down to her. She did some good, for a small few. Unsurprisingly, they love her, and when she dies she will get a state funeral. I don't believe she deserves that. I won't dance on her grave, I won't celebrate her death, but I will not celebrate her life either. I believe she did far more harm than good. If you want some proof of that, look at other countries in Europe. Every one has gone through a similar process of modernisation to that which we did under Thatcher.

Moving away from it and making the economy rely or secondary and tertiary industry means that we get more money out for every bit of money we put in.

The reason they stopped is because if they didn't their economy would have overheated on the *vast* oil industry relative to the size of their economy.

The relative size of the oil industry to the UK economy is much much smaller. It doesn't make sense to follow the same policy.

In effect the UK opted to spend the profits on infrastructure spending in general which makes sense as a solid investment- it should yield a good ROI. Norway couldn't hope to spend their oil revenues on infrastructure, there are far far fewer people and their oil/gas income is substantially larger than ours ever was.

Do I think the various Governments have spent wisely? Not really, but that's a general discussion about Government spending in general, not particular to oil revenue. In the UK's case there's no reason the revenue from that sector should be seen as a separate pot to the rest of the economy.",0,1304902626,null,0,false,0,c1t1yu9,t3_h6mzq,t1_c1t1yu9,t1_c1t1wxo,1427129909,4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,4

Why not? Being a part of the events merely means he can't go back in time. But if a cure exists, there's no reason why he couldn't put her in her box, find a bloody cure, then bring it to her. He has a time machine and that box keeps her alive indefinitely. He has an unlimited amount of time. Even *after* he saved the lives of everyone on the crashing ship, he could have shoved her in the box and said, ""I'll be right back.""

&gt;Not to mention he didn't know what she had , if she knew what she has, or how long she actually had to live.

Because *he never asked.* That's exactly my point. The Doctor *never* tried to find out what she had or even if she knew what she had (which I presume she would considering that she knows she's going to die; you don't know you're going to die of some unknown disease unless you're precognizant).

&gt;Sure he could have tried but that would take time out of everybody's day and they might not have even found a cure.

Nah, I wouldn't want to bother anyone with such a trifle.""

This is *someone's life* we're talking about. And the Doctor does *absolutely nothing* to try to save her. Even if he *fails.* Even if there *is no cure,* we could *at least* hear that said on-screen. It would take literally two lines:

* ""Why couldn't you save her, Doctor?""
* ""There's no cure in the universe for what she has. I couldn't save her.""

Bam, done. Two lines. But no. We get a Doctor who *doesn't even try.*

true,Matriss,tardis,TARDIS,"While this all makes sense (as much as any wibbly wobbly ever does) to me, I have to ask about River's role in Series Five in regards to this theory.

Did the Byzantium no longer crash?  I seem to remember them saying that the Weeping Angel on board crashed the ship in order to revitalize the other Angels with the radiation from the cracked reactor on board.  The base plot for the episode didn't have anything to do with the cracks, the Angels just went towards the energy from the crack when they noticed it.  **At least that's what I remember, I could be wrong.**

If the Byzantium crash only happened in their memories and not in reality, River did not get the pardon we were lead to assume she received.  If River's timeline is linear (but backwards) and we assume that she did not subsequently do something to earn a pardon without the aid of the Doctor then time is seriously screwed up.  It's possible that she never became a professor and never met 10.  If, then, the TARDIS was not called to the Library through some other means than River's psychic paper message, the Vashda Nerada would eat the rest of the expedition team and the ghosts would float around trapped in CAL forever.

But that would also mean that River did not die in the Library.  Did she have a life sentence?  Do we know?  What did she do after the Library if she was not killed there?

This also means that River did not actually participate in the Pandorica plot line (since it did not happen).  That would make the Doctor's first meeting with her outside of the TARDIS during Amy and Rory's wedding even though he still has his memories of meeting her in the Library and at the Byzantium crash site.

While this may or not matter to us since River's future is in the past as far as we're concerned, it's still interesting to think about--*especially* if she lives past the time of the Library and continues to seek out the Doctor.

All of that can be ignored if we assume that the Byzantium crash ordeal did happen.

**Also,** if we are to extrapolate from the idea that we are technically in a no-Doctor universe with the Doctor retconned back in, *nothing* from the show before Amy and Rory's wedding has actually happened.  Though the people involved obviously remember it all, the consequences of all of those past actions are no longer applicable if this idea is true.  While the universe is not in as much chaos as it apparently should be without the Doctor, then we have a pit of Racnoss hatchlings at the center of the Earth and that's just the *beginning* of things that should be different.  Did any of the large-scale obvious-to-the-masses plotlines from the 2005 reboot occur?  Do people remember them even if they did not happen?

What does that mean for the Time War?  Did it never happen?  If so, where are the Time Lords?  Did someone else time-lock it?  Who?

Or are we just to assume that Series Five technically no longer happened and Amy magicked the Doctor from The Big Bang into her wedding day but that all of his past exploits still occurred in one form or another?  This wouldn't be that hard to wibble wobble around, I suppose.

I'd say, although I'm not psychic, that that is probably what Xennith meant when he said ""in or out, pick one"".

I say that, because, the way Salmond phrased it, ""choosing between independence or fiscal autonomy"", seems to suggest that he thinks Scotland should be able to unilaterally declare ""fiscal autonomy"". Which it cannot, as it would be changing the terms of the agreement between Scotland and the rest of the UK. Scotland cannot say ""we're staying, but you must let us do x, y and z"". They can say ""we're leaving *unless* you let us do x, y and z"", but that is not how Salmond phrased it.

And, a minor point, the UK will never be the one ""walking away"". Yes, this is a nitpicking semantic point, but I choose to make it.

Thatcher undertook the destruction of any lingering remnants of socialism and socialist society, community was no longer as important as the self, and im afraid I see that very attitude in the gangs of today who will happily stick a knife in someones face to get what they want. Thatchers Britain. You're welcome to it.  

Its become abundantly clear to me that the union model doesnt really work very well, Britain should take a leaf from the mainlanders of Europe, who have shown that workers councils are a far more effective way of dealing with companies. Workers councils have legal rights and are a formidable force. This stops companies taking the piss out of their employees, because they  have to get certain decisions approved by the workers council before they can be implemented.

At the very least she's loads better than Martha, who really seemed more like a doormat/kicked puppy which is a shame because Freema Agyeman is a lovely actress.  I like that she's spunky - it helps drive the action - it's nice to not have the Doctor solely carry the story (and a key characteristic of a companion should be a penchant for getting in to trouble/being curious.)  

If anything I find Rory a bit more one dimensional (which might get me downvoted in to oblivion - but please, hear me out.)  Amy treats him like rubbish/ignores him most of the time (unless he's dying) and he just sort of follows her around because she's so beautiful.  I mean, he's aware that she ran off the night before their wedding, travelled with the Doctor for quite some time, kissed the Doctor (which, seeing as how they'd been travelling for quite some time, doesn't really seem like night-before-wedding-jitters, esp. considering how far she wanted to take it) and is generally dismissed by her but he doesn't really seemed bothered by it if there's a chance that she might give him the smallest bit of affection.  I'd love to see his character stand up to her (and not just for her) at least once.

With respect, I have to disagree.  Thatcher did many bad things, but breaking the stranglehold that the unions had over the country was one of the few good things she did. 

For me, the Wapping Protest illustrated this most clearly.  The unions were against any modernisation of the print industry because they wanted to protect the jobs of people with outdated skills.  If they had had their way then the UK's newspapers would still be typeset by hand using hot metal.

I agree that the way she went about it was wrong, but I can't help feeling that the unions brought it on themselves.  If you take the piss for long enough (which the unions did for a long, long time) then sooner or later a bigger bully will come along and call you out.  That bigger bully was Thatch.

To be fair, the heavy industry labour markets had already been badly crippled by the unions.  They refused to accept any kind of modernisation if it meant the loss of a single job for one of their working class brothers.  They spent more time striking than they did working (mostly as part of their politically motivated class struggle rather than to genuinely protest improper working conditions).  They could only get away with all this because these industries were heavily subsidised by UK tax-payers.

Thatcher pulled the funding and let them fail.  It is my opinion (which many would disagree with) that this was the right thing to do.  But it's incorrect to say that Thatcher destroyed industries.  The industries had already failed long before she got in power (children of the 70s like myself will remember power cuts, 3 day working weeks, rubbish piling up in the streets, etc., all due to striking workers under the previous *Labour* government).

I wasn't really alive during her reign. But it certainly doesn't seem like she was an ""evil bitch"" as the lefties would like us to know. From reading about some of the union antics at the time it appears to make sense to redress the balance.

Some of the state industries were horribly uncompetitive and inefficient - such as British Leyland, who when they weren't on strike, produced shitty cars that no one wanted to buy. I'm surprised Rover in its various privatised forms lasted so long. But the bits that were and are popular seem to be in rude health - Land Rover, Jaguar and the Mini.

Maybe some of the privatisations weren't fantastic, but how do we know that price increases in things like energy wouldn't occur today? The state owned energy board would still need to buy fuel on the open market and be subject to the vagaries of pricing just as Centrica is now. 

The worst of the privatisations (rail) wasn't even a Thatcher thing - it was Major - and many of the issues with our rail network stem from micro management. For example, the train companies just can't buy a new train. The Labour government decided to make it into some massive project where Hitachi (the winning bidder) has to build an assembly plant to assemble Japanese parts. The rail freight operators don't seem to have this issue. Why can't the train companies buy what they want providing it meets UK specs? It seems that they can't sneeze without government approval.

So, no, I won't be cheering at her death. I have much more contempt for Blair and Brown - they're the people that are to blame for our current situation - not a woman who left power 20 years ago.

The labour party never sold out, throughout it's history the party leaders who were elected have always been more moderate than the Union men who helped get them elected. Similarly it has never been a socialist party instead it has been a labour party for the common man. In 1997 Britain was becoming more and more middle class, it was difficult to see who the Labour party was really aimed at. People were still wary of a return to ""old labour"" therefore it is unsuprising they had to move right towards people who would have been previously die in the wool Labour supporters but who had benefited from the new affluence that Thatcher's economic move towards the service sector had created. In order to become electable again they had to try and emphasis their economic literacy and move away from the old labour of high taxes and redistribution. 

 In reality I think that there was less of a seismic shift from Labour and that the gradual change probably started sometime around 1984 after the crushing defeat of 1983 (""suicide note"" manifesto election) when Kinnock expelled the hard-left members of his party. After 1992 when they were defeated again, despite being pretty much assured that they would win, the need for reform grew stronger. 

I would also be very wary of any kind of narrative. Both the right-wing and left-wing are happy to represent New Labour as a party that has betrayed its principles but for different reasons. The tories because they say it shows a justification of their economic policies and the Left because it allows them to claim they are ""taking back"" their party.

There is that great quote from an unnamed cabinet minister who said that he thought he was right-wing until he met the Liberals. Similarly Plaid Cymru supporters and Greens don't necessarily support the leftist arguments that those respective parties make, they are single issue parties who have left wing policies the general electorate ignore.

Odd that you mention Donna...she is still my favorite of all from the new series.  I loved how she didn't take any crap, her sarcasm and her relationship with her grandfather, etc.  When it was first announced that Catherine Tate was going to be the new companion I was worried the show had already jumped the shark, even after The Runaway Bride I just didn't think she could pull it off and that she would be annoying as hell.  I was pleasantly surprised as it showed a side of Tate I didn't think existed.  My least favorite by far was Martha...to me she just seemed wooden...sadly at least IMHO she showed more range and emotion when she made ""visits"" after season 3 than when she was the regular companion.

I think what I like about Amy is she has the flirty sexiness of Rose, the wit, sarcasm and take no crap attitude of Donna along with the bravery of Martha.  Its like they took the best traits of the past 3 and combined them all...I guess its polarizing to some people but I really like her...plus I think the dynamic of her with Rory is just awesome and her ""girl talk"" with River makes for some of the funniest moment of the show.  They have done a great job of showing just how smitten both the doctor and Rory are with her...though completely different dynamics Rory of course loves her like anyone would love their spouse while the doctor comes across as a father/big brother figure (which considering he has ""known"" her most of her life makes sense...which with the small age difference is pretty amazing in itself...but Matt Smith plays the doctor ""older"" than both Eccleston and Tennant IMHO.",0,1304945714,null,0,false,0,c1t4h3u,t3_h6phr,t1_c1t4h3u,t1_c1t32v1,1427131092,1,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,1

I'll take that the bit about fucking around is purely subjective, but it just seems like as the recent show has portrayed the doctor as roughly the only powerful force for good in the universe, its almost criminally negligent to go have adventures. I never watched the original series, but I would imagine the existence of the time lords at least partly excused this responsibility from his shoulders. Now, it seems like he should be in a spiderman situation (great power, great responsibility and all that,) but he really isn't.

As far as the whole continuity/canon/timeline crossing thing, though, its even more annoying. Every time theres something in an episode that doesn't make sense, people just go WIBBLY WOBBLY TIMEY WIMEY as though thats the solution to all the issues. I dunno, I guess I just can't get much enjoyment out of something that doesn't make sense. It feels like the stakes are lowered somehow, because if there aren't rules, and the doctor is definitely going to work the whole thing out, then they could just flash a card on screen that said ""and then he fixed it"" two thirds of the way through the episode, and it would have as much plot connection to the beginning of the episode as the actual ends of the episodes do.

I have a TV but it is de-tuned and only used as a glorified DVD &amp; Gaming station. Thus I do not have to pay a TV license. 

I dislike the BBC &amp; TV license because:

* Whilst there is an argument for public broadcasting to provide unbiased news &amp; educational content which would otherwise not be made the BBC goes vastly beyond this.
* In chasing ratings and attempting to stay warm in peoples hearts the BBC 'crowds out' private enterprise.
* In funding populist bs the BBC removes control from consumers. In a market Joe Bloggs decides what to watch and that decision funds the creation of more content. With the BBC a bureaucrat decides and Joe Bloggs pays for it (and the bureaucrat) like it or not. 
* The TV license is a special tax pretending to be a license. There is no reason TVs need licensing, they are not dangerous (driving license), there is no limited resource (fishing license). 
* The Tax is regressive (the poor pay a larger % of their income on it). 
* The Tax is unenforceable, without proof they cannot obtain a warrant, without proof they cannot enforce payment. 

So we have a bureaucracy taking money from the honest poor &amp; middle class reducing choice &amp; crowding out private enterprise. 

Yes the BBC also does fantastic work in news (particularly local &amp; global) and educational programming and for this the poor &amp; middle class saps who're paying for it do deserve your thanks, but also I feel they deserve your pity.

Your best bet to find out what sort of speeds to expect is to use something like [SamKnows broadband checker](http://www.samknows.com/broadband/broadband_checker). This will tell you what services are available.

If you look at computers, what's driven development is firms trying to out do each other, and make something which is smaller, cheaper, lighter, faster or more powerful than the other guys. The internet existed for far longer than most people realize, but it wasn't until it was commercialized that it really took off. And look at the iPhone, prior to that smart phones were firmly the domain of the geek, but apple built a product out of the ideas and created a huge amount of competition which has resulted in multiple ecosystems competing. Android being a good example of this, as it took Linux, a free, open source OS, from something which was constantly 1 revision away from taking over from Windows (for well over a decade), and made it into a product which people would buy. 

So I do see what you mean about doing things for their own sakes and collaboration, it does have its place but it is competition which drives progress, and this is why the west developed technology at a far faster rate than the Soviet Union during the cold war. Managed chaos is good for our species, it's how we thrive.

Back in the Tom Baker days their budget was around $30k per episode or roughly 30 seconds of Star Wars. :)  Im not saying its impossible or even a bad idea...I just worry the results would end up making Doctor Who look bad.

Two lions have a success of 29%, which is 3% LESS successful than if the two lions with 15% individual success hunted by themselves (32.2%). Three lions get 27%, or 2% less than two lions. Four, five and six lions get 32% - meaning that they are (finally) as successful as sending two lions out by themselves. There is clearly no statistical value to hunting in groups.

Don't know if that's still the case or not, but if so can't the cuts be funded at least in part by running the corporation better?

I also think the BBC is missing a trick by not extending the license fee model by offering non-license payers in other countries some sort of subscription for access to more iPlayer content / discount DVD / other services (obviously some BBC content needs to remain freely available to everyone everywhere).

You are being elliptical. I don't really see how to fill in what you have left out in a way that gives a coherent argument.

The uncharitable approach is to point out that the ordinary bloke on the street struggles with abstract reasoning and tends to just give up and guess wildly. We could get some-one like that to be Prime Minister and that would meet your criteria for being ""representative"" but it would also be unwise.

An alternative notion of ""representative"" is that the ordinary bloke on the street is choosing the man to represent him in Parliament in much the same way that he is chosing a lawyer to represent him in court: he wants the best (cleverest) lawyer he can get. That is often an Oxford or Cambridge man.

&gt; how the 21st century political landscape looks very like 18th and 19th century ones by way of who actually runs the parties

Oxford and and Cambridge have changed a lot over the centuries. Adam Smith went to Balliol College in 1740 and in a recent biography Nicholas Phillipson comments

&gt; Smith cannot have gone to Oxford with particularly high expectations. The reformist Whig circles in which he moved in Kirkcaldy and Glasgow had long regarded Oxford as a faction-ridden swamp of Jacobites and high Anglican zealotry and as a by-word for academic incompetence... this was a period in which Oxford's low reputation for teaching and scholarship ... became a matter of national scandal. 

To say that Cameron studyied at Oxford in the 20th century is to say something very different from saying X studied at Oxford in the 18th century.

&gt; how little chance there is for anyone who doesn't go to either Oxford or Cambridge or one of their satellites to have a meaningful say in the running of the country.

Notice that in the recent referendum only a handful of places voted yes. Edinburgh Central, Oxford, Cambridge, a few others. It is hard to see this country as being run by intellectuals. The great British public have their say and that decides the matter.

Nor I am not suggesting or claiming that the BBC mandates that people watch their programs. I'm complaining that they take resources (money) to do things which could be done by private enterprise. This is crowding out plain and simple (the definition is on wikipedia if you're confused).

The tone of your post is rather abusive and rude btw, worth remembering you're talking to real people here not clever bot. I don't really care about this - I don't have any skin in the game. I don't watch TV (online or off) &amp; consequently I don't have to pay the TV license so it's all academic to me. 

The number of channels is down to the technological capability to broadcast them. You can have crowding out in a growing market - it still reduces the incentives for private enterprise. 

The losers in this are not those people who want to watch the rating chasing Beeb output, it's the people who only want to watch say cricket or footie but are then forced to subsidize someones soap watching habit. (I'm perfectly happy for the gov to force these people to subsidize people who watch BBC news, although I think this should be society wide).

This isn't a fix, this just changes the problem to one they aren't emotionally attached to. But it's still a real problem that will negatively affect our future quality of life, or at least not increase it as much as it could.

We need a system that takes the good aspects of capitalism while ensuring social responsibility i.e. making people/corporations minimise their harm at all times, rather than putting a price on negative externalities after the fact and letting cost/benefit analysis dictate whether you dump toxic waste in Africa.

&gt;**Third Doctor**           
&gt;This incarnation of the Doctor started to say that he had been a scientist for ""several thousand"" years, but stopped himself before completing the sentence. (DW: The Mind of Evil) He had made a similar age reference shortly before that incident. 
               
&gt;**Fourth Doctor**            
&gt;It would seem that the Fourth Doctor would have been 748 at the time of his regeneration. (DW: Planet of the Spiders) This incarnation of the Doctor consistently described himself as around 750.

&gt;**Sixth Doctor**            
&gt;The Doctor described himself as 900 years old (DW: Revelation of the Daleks) and later stated his age as ""900 years, more or less"". 

&gt;**Seventh Doctor**            
&gt;Hours after his regeneration, the Doctor unlocked a door in the Rani's laboratory with the numerical code ""953,"" which he stated was both his age and the Rani's. (DW: Time and the Rani)
            
&gt;The Doctor spent unspecified millions of years in a coma, frozen in a block of ice. (BFA: Frozen Time)

&gt;By the time of his next regeneration, he had aged visibly. (DW: Doctor Who)

&gt;By his own estimate afterward he would have been 1009 when he regenerated, though he admitted he may have lost count at some point. (EDA: Vampire Science) 

&gt;**Eighth Doctor**            
&gt;Three years after his regeneration, the Doctor calculated his total age to be 1012, making him 1009 when he regenerated. He admitted that he was unsure, however, as there was a question of whether he lost count. 

&gt;The Doctor aged while trapped as an amnesiac on Earth in ""real time"" between the late 19th century (EDA: The Ancestor Cell) and the year 2001, making him at least 1125 by the time this crisis was over. (EDA: Escape Velocity)

&gt;At one point while traveling with Lucie Miller, the Doctor spent 600 years on the planet Orbis. He later mentioned that he rounded and adjusted his age based on different year lengths in different parts of the universe. (BFA: Orbis) For this reason he preferred to simply start counting at his most recent regeneration, giving his age as ""three."" (EDA: Vampire Science) 

&gt;**Ninth Doctor**            
&gt;This incarnation claimed ""900 years of time and space"", i.e. travel in his TARDIS, and when asked, said that this was his age

&gt;**The ""900"" Controversy**            
&gt;The decision by the writers of the 2005 revival of the series to explicitly describe the Doctor as 900 years old, despite evidence to the contrary on TV and expanded media, is one of the few notable contradictions to established canon in the revival. Although as noted above it's possible to suggest rationalisations (and fans have suggested others ranging from Time War-related trauma to speculation of an unchronicled adventure in which the Doctor was ""de-aged"" much as he was ""aged"" in DW: The Sound of Drums and Last of the Time Lords), to date no episode, novel or comic strip has attempted to address the discrepancy. One simple explaination would be that the Doctor has, simply, taken to lying about his age (precedent for this exists in DW: The Ribos Operation in which Romana catches the Doctor shaving a few years off his age - something she, herself, apparently does after her first regeneration). Another is that his measurements of years might vary based on which planet he's using as a baseline; a year on Gallifrey is unlikely to be the same as a year on Earth. Another may be that he has come to base his age off the time he has spent travelling in the TARDIS. 

&gt;**""He Has No Clue""**            
&gt;A simpler and even more self-evident theory is that the Doctor doesn't really know how old he actually is, as constantly traveling backward and forward through time could make it very difficult to measure one's lifespan at all. This theory has been fanon, and the Doctor occasionally admitted to being unsure of his age in spinoff media. (DWM: The Time Witch, EDA: Vampire Science)

&gt;This is the theory subscribed to by Doctor Who's current executive producer and head writer Steven Moffat, as stated in an interview with SFX Magazine:             

&gt;*"" The thing I keep banging on about is that he doesn't know what age he is. He's lying. How could he know, unless he's marking it on a wall? He could be 8,000 years old, he could be a million. He has no clue. The calendar will give him no clues.""*

true,NEWSBOT3,cnty-uk,Londontown,"the bbc told us (on their SNP referendum article) that Scotland has a budget of £32bn a year which comes from the UK. I'm not sure how much of that is generated in scotland, but i'd be surprised if it was near or above that.

edit : further research;

scotland has a population of 5.17 million, and pays just under 8% of UK tax (as a total). That roughly means that their tax income is equivalent to their population ratio within the UK.

according to wikipedia,
&gt; 2007-08, total government revenue was 39.2 per cent of GDP, with net taxes and National Insurance contributions standing at 36.9 per cent of GDP[1]—approximately £600 billion 

Therefore, based on my very rough and you shouldn't trust it all research, i would say that Scotland

**pays 8% of the uk's taxes BUT costs the UK only 5.3% of it's budget**

However, that's not a straight comparison, the data isn't entirely current etc, and not all of the UK's income comes from taxes. I did some googling to find the full budget income figures, but i had no luck and now i need to eat before i die of starvingness.

&gt; **The Mirrors. (my S6 theory)**
&gt;
&gt; &gt;   “Not the same. Two planes, two worlds. Two cars parked in the same space. There are lots of different universes nestled inside each other. Every now and again they collide and you can step between one and the other. All the reflections have suddenly become gateways.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Ever look in a mirror and feel you’re seeing a whole other world?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Well this time it’s not an illusion.”
&gt;
&gt;-The Doctor, The Curse of the Black Spot
&gt;   
&gt; **The Mystery of the Mirrors **  
&gt; 
&gt;AKA The questionable S6 plot arc, as guessed by Chelsea who probably is crazy.
&gt;but she really hopes she’s not
&gt;
&gt;With the beginning quote in mind, and the knowledge of the Siren/Sick Bay Doctor in the CoTBS, we know that you can travel between alternate universes through the mirrors.
&gt;
&gt;In the beginning of the Impossible Astronaut, we see the Astronaut come out of the lake and shoot the Doctor.
&gt;
&gt; [Picture 1](http://imgur.com/4mez5)
&gt;
&gt; I don’t know about you guys, but I can’t be the only one who thought (after watching both parts of the two part opener) “Why the crap is it coming out of the lake?”
&gt; 
&gt; After watching CoTBS, I recognized this particular part:
&gt; 
&gt; [Picture 2](http://imgur.com/B7CCy)
&gt;
&gt;Hmm. Something crossing from an alternate universe through water? I wonder! Now, think about how many mirrors we’ve seen in regards to strange things going on.
&gt;
&gt;Check out the *moon*’s mirrored reflection in the lake:
&gt;
&gt; [Picture 3](http://imgur.com/jaEpE)
&gt;
&gt; And at the *moon* in CoTBS:
&gt;
&gt; [Picture 4](http://imgur.com/8xhfOl)
&gt;
&gt; Reflected in the water!
&gt; 
&gt; Other instances… 
&gt;
&gt; [Picture 5](http://imgur.com/GhdpJ)
&gt; 
&gt; The astronaut helmet seems very reflective doesn’t it?
&gt;
&gt; [Picture 6](http://imgur.com/LZgjq)
&gt;
&gt; Check out that mirror to the right of Amy. Pretty well positioned, huh?
&gt; 
&gt; [Picture 7](http://imgur.com/ZjAzR)
&gt; 
&gt; Same with the mirror behind the Silence. Strange, huh?
&gt;
&gt; [Picture 8](http://imgur.com/dOicU)
&gt;
&gt;They even used the reflection of the astronaut as a promotional picture!
&gt;
&gt;Here’s my personal favorite reflection instance (and probably the most crack-filled)…
&gt;
&gt; [Picture 9](http://imgur.com/F4Akz)
&gt;
&gt; The Doctor’s face is reflected in the pregnancy test screen.
&gt;
&gt;So my theory is that there’s two universes, two timelines that are happening and crossing over. One where Amy is pregnant, and one where she isn’t. The crazy eyepatch lady is part of the timeline where Amy IS pregnant, and she’s leaking through into the timeline where she isn’t. And that’s pretty much my thoughts. But suddenly a lot of things make sense. The code on the DW Official Website that said “The answers you seek will be found here on the Webb”… a man by the last name of Webb directed Day of the Moon and Impossible Astronaut. That’s my two cents.

- England\* is stuck with permanent Tory govt, with all that implies
- People in England who want progressive, liberal etc migrate to Scotland (regardless of no more UK, this would presumably still be easy due to EU freedom of movement)
- Even fewer people in England voting for progressive, liberal etc
- Even more people in Scotland voting for that
- Repeat
- Fast forward x decades, how big a division will there be!?

As a (progressive, liberal etc) English person I'd be pleased for Scotland getting their 'paradise' but obviously kind of cheesed off about things south of the border!  I would emigrate in a flash myself if Scotland only had a mediterranean climate, damnit!

([Source](http://www.ox.ac.uk/admissions/undergraduate_courses/courses/mathematics/mathematics_.html) -- I omitted the equivalent Scottish/International stuff for brevity.)

Suppose 1000 applicants meet these requirements, and Oxford has only 100 places in Maths to give. Under the present system it simply chooses the what it thinks are the best 100 candidates out of the 1000 who meet the requirements and they go on to study Maths at Oxford, paying the standard amount (9000 GBP) for the privilege.

Under the system proposed by the government, say 10% of places would be set aside for people who can pay a higher fee. Then Oxford chooses only the best 90 candidates. It then looks at the subset of those ranked 91-1000 who met the entrance requirements AND have enough money to pay the higher fee and chooses the best 10 of those. Let's suppose they are ranked 91,96,101,111,121,125,130,145,167,170 in the overall list of candidates. These 10 people join the 90 best at Oxford, but pay a higher fee.

The candidates ranked 92-95,97-100 etc. are rejected. They do not get to study Maths at Oxford because their parents did not have enough money. They would probably have made better mathematicians (or whatever) than most of the 10 rich people who bought a place, but too bad.

Communism was one of many many factors that meant the USSR fell. They were being constantly attacked by the west, and were taking over a country that already had severe difficulties.

Adoption != quality. Ubuntu has been as good as Windows for a few versions now, and I think one of the main barriers of adoption is familiar software, games, and quality software (Creative Suite, for instance).

Some people have a passion for taking a good idea and turning it into something people can use in everyday life. Just because they weren't getting paid, that passion wouldn't cease to exist, in fact they'd be freer to pursue it without pressure from management, etc.

And as for competition. Why are we like this? Because we've had it drilled into civilisation for the past millenia or so. Things like socialism require a radical change in mindset and that doesn't happen over night. This is why it's the next step for humanity as opposed to a bill that needs to be passed.

It's not like competition wouldn't exist within a communal system - look at the fragmentation and competition in the Open Source community.

If whoever handles Oxford admissions (presumably they're competent) ranks a particular poor person 92, and a particular rich person 170 then, yes, the most reasonable conclusion is that 92 is likely to make a better student than 170. 

(Just to be clear I don't mean Oxford ranks them only by A-level marks or something. I mean after marks, tests, interviews --  whatever Oxford does to decide who it'd most like to come to their university to study Maths, it ranks the poor student as 92 and the rich student as 170).",0,1304983406,null,0,false,0,c1t7tq7,t3_h7lir,t1_c1t7tq7,t1_c1t7s42,1427132741,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

true,Ivashkin,null,null,"&gt; Communism was one of many many factors that meant the USSR fell. They were being constantly attacked by the west, and were taking over a country that already had severe difficulties.

They were also attacking the West. But I know and work with quite a few ex-soviets, and their main explanation for why it fell was simply that it failed to develop fast enough. I honestly think communism will only work in a post scarcity society, and by that point it will probably be the default position. But we are many generations away from that happening.

&gt; Adoption != quality. Ubuntu has been as good as Windows for a few versions now, and I think one of the main barriers of adoption is familiar software, games, and quality software (Creative Suite, for instance).

I would disagree, its a very good alternative (not a replacement though) to XP, and to Vista, but compared to W7 or the latest versions of OSX it just isn't quite as polished or well thought out. And the lack of commercial applications such as the Adobe CS suite or the vCenter client is a problem.

&gt; Some people have a passion for taking a good idea and turning it into something people can use in everyday life. Just because they weren't getting paid, that passion wouldn't cease to exist, in fact they'd be freer to pursue it without pressure from management, etc.

Look at Android apps vs iOS apps, with Android you get lots more freedom to develop a variety of applications which do pretty much anything, but they are not as polished as the OSX versions. This is in part to Google not providing a decent UI framework, partly because they don't enforce quality controls and partly because developers are not as focused on making products, they are focusing on just making programs.

&gt; And as for competition. Why are we like this? Because we've had it drilled into civilisation for the past millenia or so. Things like socialism require a radical change in mindset and that doesn't happen over night. This is why it's the next step for humanity as opposed to a bill that needs to be passed.

Not just the last millenia or so, competition has been a part of human nature for longer than we've been human. And it's always been due to our desire for resources outstripping the amount of resources we can obtain at any one time. Your right in thinking that socialism isn't going to happen over night, because quite frankly the resources we require for a truly socialist society without rationing or limitations (and corruption, which was and is always a problem with socialist society's just as much as it was and is with capitalist societies) will not be available to us for some time. To put it simply, we do not have the resources to give everyone on the planet an iPhone. So until we reach that point, we need to focus on allowing competition to drive progress, while preventing the worst excesses of capitalism, or corporatism from dividing society to much.

After all thats happened it doesn't take much 'risk assessment' or justification to move peaceful protest away and claim it's a risk to the public.

I'd have been really interested to see if a protracted peaceful protest could have shut the place down - it would've forced Tesco to carry more staff and pay additional security, and on the flip side reduced the numbers of people going into the shop so reduced takings. The economics would eventually bite and the place would shut. It bothers me that all the violence has done is make the council/police/tesco think - well we're not going to let these fuckers push us around, there WILL be a Tesco there, even if it's a loss making Tesco, just to prove a point.

Embassy around the world, also we legally are entitled to some, but will will take a cheque as payment.

Any non native scot, will have to apply for a visa for residency and a work visa, like any other country, unless they take up scottish nationality which if they have lived here for a set time should be automatic.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt; Now not even the Royal Mail uses trains to transport goods. 

Because it's cheaper to do so by plane or road. Royal Mail lurches from loss to loss - if the trains are more expensive they have to go.

&gt;  Major lines were axed throughout the '60s and '70s leading up to the sell-off of the industry in the '90s.

Wasn't the Beeching report commissioned to decide which underused routes to axe? Are you suggesting that there was a 30 year plan to privatise the rail industry?

&gt; They can't shut down the network entirely, but there hasn't been major investment in maintaining the infrastructure or modernising the rails, beds or stock in decades.

You mean like the High Speed 1 line, the planned High Speed 2 line, the electrification of the WCML. investments in newer signalling systems, GSM-R with ERTMS, etc?

As for stock, there have been several stock purchases over the years. It's not as if the entire network is running on ex-British Rail stock that the cavemen used.

Besides, the older trains are perfectly serviceable, and (IMO) are better. The HST is leagues ahead of the likes of the Voyager that CrossCountry use.

&gt; It's being allowed to wither,

I'm not denying that the government has shifted priorities to the road network, but this seems like too much hyperbole.

&gt; Actually, that's already what it is, mostly. 

Not down here, it seems. Nearly hourly services from London that, since they stop at a lot of stations, also get used by commuters like me.

It would help if this country didn't have such an extreme bias toward the south east. Things are cramped up there while in the rest of the country we get better trains and plenty of legroom.

&gt; You cut down the services so that ridership drops off, then you can eliminate the service due to low ridership. 

http://www.statistics.gov.uk/cci/nugget.asp?id=1094 suggests that rail usage is steady if not increasing in recent years.

true,Kim147,uk,British Sandgroper,"I'm one of the anti BBC people . I find it very biased , propagandises a lot and produces a lot of rubbish . Program quality is not good . I went through a period of watching Al Jazeera and Russia Today as alternate news sources . These days , however , it's France24 - which is excellent . I also watch quite a bit of ITV , some Ch5 and some C4 .

The BBC seems to think that it has to compete with all the commercial stations from providing reality TV programs - competing against C4 etc. - to tons of taint - Sky \ Fox . This is not it's purpose . It is there to provide what the commercial stations won't or can't provide . Be that objective journalism , quality dramas , good science programs etc. .

I do think that the BBC has got very far from it's charter and it should be unbiased and produce quality programs . It has certainly produced some brilliant programs in the past however in recent years things seem to be getting worse and worse .

The solution ? - may actually be to downsize it greatly , even divide it up into separate individually funded units . The fact is if they are doing a great job then people will be happy to pay for it one way or another . If they aren't then they are just wasting money .

Yeah, let's all move to the *quality* Sky offerings. At five times the price.

&gt;This is crowding out plain and simple (the definition is on wikipedia if you're confused).

No, this is value for money. Check your wallet after subscribing to Virgin/ Sky if you're confused. Cbeebies *alone* is worth 40p a day.

The tone of your post is rather selfish and arrogant, so there you go.

&gt;You can have crowding out in a growing market - it still reduces the incentives for private enterprise.

No, it forces private enterprise to offer value for money (which Sky/ Virgin are failing to do on an impressive scale).

&gt;The losers in this are not those people who want to watch the rating chasing Beeb output, it's the people who only want to watch say cricket or footie but are then forced to subsidize someones soap watching habit.

true,DaveLambert,tardis,TARDIS,"I agree that Rose treated Mickey badly, but I think the reasons for it were defined in the first episode, ""Rose"". We saw a Rose and Mickey who didn't appear to be involved as a couple too long so far (kinda confirmed in Tennant's final episode, when we see Rose and her mum talking about what they were doing on New Year's of that same year, before the 9th Doctor came into Rose's life).  They were playful and cute with each other. Then 9 came along and showed her something different.  Not in a man, per se, but in a way of looking at the universe, and her role in it. Then it looked like Mickey was dead, and she was clearly upset. Upset that he was gone, upset at the Doctor for not only letting it happen, but for not even caring about him or thinking about him.

Then she found Mickey alive but kidnapped, and she was relieved...until she saw a whole different side of him. A cowering, scared Mickey who didn't know what to do in the face of fear.  Someone who couldn't find it in himself to act, but instead just wanted to run.  Rose wasn't this type of person; she demonstrated right off that she could be brave, and act when necessary (when the Autons held the Doctor and threatened him, and the Nestene activated the signal to turn all the plastics on Earth into more Autons and threaten humanity as a whole).

Rose might have been pissed at the Doctor for not thinking/caring about Mickey's possible death, and seen him as an alien thing.  But she came to realize that he saw the world in a different, bigger way...a way she wanted to share and learn about.  Seeing Mickey be the polar opposite of this philosophy, who was only concerned about himself and who was willing to abandon the Doctor - and hence humanity! - when the going got tough...well, that set the stage for their lines at the end of that episode: ""Fat lot of good you were"" she told Mickey as he stumbled out of the TARDIS, after they used it to leave the underground. Then, when the Doctor makes his offer for Rose to come along, she says to Mickey:  ""Thanks"" ""Thanks for what?"" ""Exactly!"" (kisses him goodby, turns and runs into the TARDIS).

Mickey truly DESERVED that treatment just then, after behaving like such an idiot.  Then, mind you, he began to shape up.  Rose inspired him, if you will.  He became more accepting of things outside of his comfort zone, more courageous, and generally stronger in body, mind and spirt. His character development was sensational...and hardly given any spotlight.  It absolutely killed me when Martha was billed as ""the first black companion""...I screamed ""what about MICKEY!?"" when I read that.  In the end he deserved a happy ending.  But not with Rose; she was already hopelessly in love with the 10th Doctor by that time.  But putting Mickey and Martha [together as a married couple in their final appearance](/spoiler) felt a bit tacked-on, so I was unhappy to see that when it first aired.  Still, he came a long way.  Despite that journey, though, I tend to think of him deserving of Rose's bad treatment just because of his simpering idiocy when we first met him.

If there was ANYthing bad about how Rose treated Mickey, it was that she didn't ever make it crystal-clear that they were no longer a couple, and he should have figured it out on his own but didn't want to see the obvious.  So she should have finished the relationship and gotten him off the hook.  THAT was the worst thing she did to him.

They don't slot much time for appointments so if you have more then one concern make it known so they book a double spot.

true,chrisjd,eng-Oxfordshire,Oxfordshire,"1) Don't know about ultrasounds, it sounds like a long time to wait though.

2) You usually see the same doctor each time, if not the surgery should at least tell you if your normal doctor isn’t available and who you can see instead.

3) They seem to only allocate about 10 minutes for a regular appointment although most aren’t rude to you if you go over they just accept it. If you need longer it is best to tell them in advance though.

4) There is some information about complaining [here](http://www.pals.nhs.uk
/cmsContentView.aspx?Itemid=944). The PALS service is quite good you can ring them up and just get advice rather than going straight to making a complaint. I’ve made a complaint about a doctor before and you get the option to make it formal or informal, I went for the informal option and was then invited to talk though all the issues with the doctor concerned (with no time limits!). It worked out quite well once they realised I was on the verge of making a formal complaint they started paying more attention.

My girlfriend has some health issues, which is where most of my experience is from, her GP is really good and always has plenty of time for her by either face to face appointments or over the phone. It is easy to change GPs and it sounds like most of the issues you are having are down to having a bad GP so finding a new one might be the best answers, it’s not so easy to change which specialist you see which is why I ended up going down the complaint route.

Regarding your other queries:

1. GP's are supposed to streamline and filter the cases that are referred to specialists. some of them take this role too seriously and can be fairly dismissive of patient's concerns. My wife has cysts too and had abrupt weight gains. Our first GP just told her that she is probably eating too much. After we moved home and registered with a different GP, things changed drastically. she was referred to a PCOS clinic and was put under the specialist care of an endocrinologist and a gynaecologist.

2. In my surgery, they try and fix you up with your assigned GP. The usual rule is either you wait a few days to meet your GP or meet whoever is available, if it's urgent.

3. In my surgery they ask you to notify them during the appointment booking itself if you need more time with the GP.  By default, they book you in for 10 minutes and someone else might be booked in for the next slot.

4. GP's operate under a Primary Care Trust and they should have a PCT Manager and a complaints procedure.

Also, I think a lot of the lean towards Amy being worse than Rose (in this sense) is that in the series Rory was a *completely* sympathetic character in his introduction. He openly cared for Amy and his disbelief of the situation didn't hamper this. He was supportive of Amy the entire time the Atraxi/Prisoner Zero event was going on and he's totally loyal to her through the rest of the series. 

Mickey's introduction implied he'd rather watch a football game than stay with Rose after she almost died in the explosion. Granted, she insisted she was fine, but it doesn't really look good and *is* stereotypic ""bad boyfriend"" behavior. Mickey even let Rose go into a stranger's home alone (when she met the man regarding Doctor sightings), regardless of the fact that he admitted the dangers of meeting people you meet on the internet. (How did he know that as soon as the door closed behind Rose she wouldn't get murdered or something?) Perhaps you could make an argument that this was the wiser course of action (though I don't see it) but both me and the couple I'm getting into Who saw this part and both of them openly screamed, ""Why're you letting her go alone!?""

Your experience will depend very much on where you are, but mental health services around the country are underfunded and oversubscribed. There are numerous gatekeepers to be negotiated before receiving any meaningful help.

I don't know what help you are hoping to get from a psychiatrist - unless your wife is prone to extreme behaviour (endangering her safety or that of others) - it's more likely she will be referred back to the GP for medication. 

If you find it impossible to get to the NHS psychiatrist, look into seeing someone privately. It will cost a couple of hundred pounds, but may assist you in cutting through the indifference of NHS mental health services.

It's worth calling these people for advice (or to find out whether our experiences with the NHS are unusual!)

&gt;Under the plans, the extra students may be charged as much as international undergraduates. At the most competitive universities, these students face fees ranging from £12,000 a year for arts subjects to £18,000 for sciences and more than £28,000 for medicine.

It also mentions explicitly over and over again that these will be extra places which would not otherwise be offered. So if they don't offer it and the Rich person still applies, they could end up taking a place via merit which would otherwise be available to a poorer student under this proposal.

The idea of the proposal is to take the rich out of the state funded places which are getting cut so that the majority of the state funded places are available for the poor.

Or another way to look at it is that the Government want to allow Universities to accept fully paying students via a number of methods outside of the current quotas. Universities live on the money from International students so getting the rich to pay the same can only help as the cuts aren't going to go away.

&gt;Make rich people pay more to do the same courses as regular people?

would go something like this:

(Plan A): You look at who has been accepted. You find the rich ones and tell them that they can't attend university unless they pay extra. The rest pay the regular fee. This is, in effect, how it used to work thirty or so years ago.

The proposal in the article is different, and to state it in it's mildest possible turns, would go like this:

(Plan B): You look at who's been accepted. You accept them all on a regular fee. You then make some extra places available. Their will be many people who were rejected despite meeting the basic admissions requirements. Some (a minority) of these people who were not accepted will be rich. You accept the best of these rich people into the extra places. These rich people are worse than many who were rejected but the fact that they have money allows them to go to university despite that.

Surely you can see that Plan B is more unfair than Plan A?

Now if Plan B is the only way to save universities; if Plan A (and every other plan more fair than Plan B) would result in universities getting worse, having less places and a worse education to offer students, then maybe we should do Plan B. This wouldn't suddenly make Plan B fair -- it would just be an evil we'd have to accept for a greater good. I'd still criticize Plan B, argue against people who think it's totally fine, and say it makes me sick, it's unjust etc. but we have to grit our teeth and do it none the less.

Letting someone who meets the entrance requirements but is willing to fully fund themselves through University onto the course takes them away from the quota criterion which has to be met and removes the need for funding from the Government for that Student, they become part of the off-quota group. 

Thus giving that student an extra place does not take away from the state-funded students, on the contrary it gives the University more money to ensure that the education for the state-funded pupils is maintained at a high level of excellence, whilst also removing the rich student from the pool of students competing for a state-funded place.

The question needs a relevance to something. It's certainly not a justification for independence either way. By that same logic, parts of Scotland should be independent from that Scotland because they are either a burden or the rest of Scotland is a burden to them. The independence argument is not about how much it costs, but how people are best governed. Independence is a question of political, diplomatic and financial governance, not what is cheapest.

true,3gv,null,null,"I love when the Doctor visits real historical figures, particularly writers. It just makes the time travel element seem so much more real when real historical events are involved. I think the the show's writers get to have a lot of fun with the script when there's a writer involved, they get to mimic the writer's tone. And H.P. Lovecraft certainly leaves a lot of room for fantastic 'Who stories! Personally, I've been hoping for an episode with Edgar Allen Poe ever since *The Unicorn and the Wasp* with Agatha Christie. The tone of the episode would be deliciously macabre and well, as far as I'm concerned, Poe may have actually traveled through time:  
  
Poe published his only novel, [The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym of Nantucket](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Narrative_of_Arthur_Gordon_Pym_of_Nantucket), in 1838. It's about a crew of sailors on a whaling ship named *Grampus.* During a storm, the boat capsizes and four sailors manage to escape on a life boat. While adrift at sea, three survivors cannibalize the cabin boy named Richard Parker.  
  
In 1884, the yacht *Mignonette* sank. Four people survived, drifted in a life boat, and finally cannibalized the cabin boy Richard Parker. This led to the [R v Dudley and Stephens](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R_v_Dudley_and_Stephens) criminal case.  
  
In addition to that coincidence, Poe's death was very [mysterious](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_of_Edgar_Allan_Poe). On September 27, 1849, Poe left Virginia for New York. There is no record of what happened in the days that followed, until he was found staggering around Baltimore on October 3, in distress and wearing someone else's clothes. He died 4 days later.  
&gt; Poe is said to have repeatedly called out the name ""Reynolds"" on the night before his death, though no one has ever been able to identify the person to whom he referred. One possibility is that he was recalling an encounter with [Jeremiah N. Reynolds](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeremiah_N._Reynolds), a newspaper editor and explorer who may have inspired the novel *The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym of Nantucket.*

Sure, Micky was pretty bad in ""Rose"", but as the series went on, he became really supportive of her, still trying to be a good boyfriend and she just strung him along for months at a time, never really breaking up with him (and getting really mad at him when he tried to move on in Boomtown) but never keeping him close, either.    She was really trying to have an actual relationship with both of them at the same time.  If the Doctor wanted to advance their relationship at any point in the first two seasons, you know Rose would have jumped at the chance regardless of Mickey.  

Amy ran off on her wedding night then put the moves on the Doctor, but even she admitted she was just trying for a one-night stand type of situation and was panicking over the wedding.  It doesn't really excuse her behavior but when they both basically called her out on her behavior, and then the Dream Lord forced her to choose, she knew that Rory was the one she actually loved, and I think she tried to make amends after that. 

Rose pretty much continued to treat Mickey like crap even after he stayed in the parallel world, it seemed like she was still stringing him along in Army of Ghosts / Doomsday.  Then apparently they weren't even friends anymore in Journey's End, RTD said Mickey came along mostly to protect Jackie and to get back to his first universe.  

I like Rose as a character most of the time, but when it comes to how she treated Mickey, I kind of hated her.    After the pilot, he really didn't deserve to be treated that way.  Every other time we saw him, his character had more and more growth and by the end of season 2, he was every bit of the hero as the Doctor was.",0,1305051287,null,0,false,0,c1tcjko,t3_h7v21,t1_c1tcjko,t1_c1t9mlw,1427134964,3,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,3

The deterrent effect of capital punishment:
A review of the research evidence

Janet Chan and Deborah Oxley,
School of Social Science and Policy, University of New South Wales

Capital punishment has been abolished in all Australian States since the mid 1980s. The United
States of America is the only Western democracy that has retained the death penalty. The aim of this
bulletin is to analyse and summarise the empirical evidence on the deterrent effect of capital
punishment. It provides a survey of the results of 74 research projects published between 1952 and
2003. These projects employed a variety of methodologies, including economic modelling, and
covered a range of geographical areas and time periods mainly in the United States. The majority
of the studies show that the use of capital punishment did not deter the commission of homicide; this
remains the case when studies that used relatively unsophisticated research designs were excluded.
The bulletin concludes that three decades of deterrence research since Ehrlich’s (1975a) economic
model has failed to deliver conclusive evidence on the deterrent effect of capital punishment.",0,1305054880,null,0,true,0,c1tcz5s,t3_h81em,t1_c1tcz5s,t1_c1tap4b,1427135170,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

The TC approach has it's flaws. For one you need to actually use the more visible OS for it to be believable. And you cannot access data from one to the other.

There's a theory that I like for this season that says the events of last season created two overlapping, paradoxical universes. This is why Rory can remember being plastic, and why Amy can be and not be pregnant at the same time. It follows that the TARDIS might also be in a state somewhere in between: there WAS a reason that it exploded, having to do with the Silents. That version of history is wrapped up with the Old!Doctor we meet at the beginning of The Impossible Astronaut. He has no TARDIS: just a car. When his companions dispose of the body, *there is no TARDIS to dispose* which I think is key: we know of the immense power of the TARDIS. If they had to burn the Doctor's body, they sure as hell would have had to destroy the TARDIS. And yet it is never seen or mentioned until Younger!Doctor has it in the bathroom of the diner. 

This is also how I think they're going to get out of the dead Doctor problem.

There are more children missing and being abused in the UK than just this girl, and because they're a white middle-class couple doesn't give them the right to manipulate peoples emotions.  

In fact, there is a history of cancer campaigners and other people with afflictions who work hard for their causes, these people get praised for their strength and willingness to use their pain to help others.  From a purely cynical point of view if they want kudos then that would make more sense.


Some of the kids these charities deal with would LOVE to be able to disappear as that would end the abuse that affects them daily:

""Republicanism is as much an integral part of British tradition and history as the monarchy... The Magna Carta of 1215, the 1689 Bill of Rights, the Great Reform Act of 1832, and the introduction of universal suffrage in 1920, are all pioneering political advances.""

Those advances are NOT Republican. They were not done to remove the monarchy, they were done to increase the representation and power of the people, but in no way were intended to culminate in the removal of the monarchy. Movements to curtail the power of the monarchy are exactly that; support of the monarchy but containment of their power.

Then you have this little gem: ""[The Monarchy] does do harm, it harms our democracy, it harms our society and it gets in the way of genuine reform."" 

I have yet to see any significant evidence of this being true. The republican movement seems to just be all-or-nothing, that we should focus entirely on removing the monarchy and things would somehow be better? We would be running under the exact same system as now, just without a monarchy. I personally find the above statement to generally result in baseless conjecture on the evils of a constitution.

I do not own a television or receiver though, only a computer on which I watch non-live broadcast TV (iPlayer etc, not tvcatchup though).  I was getting letters every 3 to 6 months.  This one stopped all communication, except their acknowledgement that they would not contact me further, as I'd essentially withdrawn the right for them to walk up my garden path.  Don't even give these arseholes your name.

Dear Sir or Madam,

I write to inform you that I do not require a TV license at the above property.  There is no equipment installed or used at this address that is capable of receiving broadcast TV programmes in the manner prescribed by you. I state this in full awareness of the requirements set out in Part 4 of the Communications Act 2003 on Licensing of TV Reception: also, I am fully aware of the requirements on TV licensing set out in the Communication (Television Licensing) Regulations 2004.

I do not want to receive from you reminders that this address is unlicensed.  Further, I do not want to receive from you correspondence suggesting that I might be using TV receiving equipment at this address, threatening investigation by a TV licensing enforcement officer.  Your letters are distressing and cause me anxiety.  Any such correspondence will be an offence under the Malicious Communications Act 1988 since you have no reasonable grounds for demanding that this address requires a TV licence.

I will not tolerate any visit by a TV licensing enforcement officer at my address. Therefore I withdraw from TV Licensing, its employees and/or its agents, the implied right of access to my property at XXXXXXXXXX.  Henceforth, no employee or agent of TV Licensing qualifies as an invitee to my property. Any such person who ventures onto my property at XXXXXXXXX will be trespassing on my land, and I shall not hesitate to seek legal redress for the offence caused.

Please note that I am under no obligation to provide you with any of my details, including my name.  This fact was confirmed by the BBC in June 2009 in response to FOI request RFI20090807. This response states that ""TV Licensing does not legally require the name of an individual to action such a request"".  

Any request by you for further information will be considered to be harrassment, and I would again draw your attention to the offences under the Malicious Communications Act 1988.  

You are invited to reply to this letter solely to acknowledge that I have given you formal notice as to my position.

Yours sincerely,


The Legal Occupier

I'm not suggesting this will solve the issue overnight, or even prevent piracy. Afterall, some people just want stuff for free, regardless of their original price.

To be honest I'm not sure if there is a be-all and end-all solution. I too am guilty of piracy (games/films mostly), however if I enjoy said media then I always end up buying the content legally. For me piracy is a way of ""previewing"" the product without spending money only to find I don't like it.

As I see it that is a bit different than speculation and theorycrafting. I love to speculate, to imagine what could be.

Of course that is were I disagree with Steven Moffat. People enjoy things differently. His perspective about how things are best enjoyed is entirely subjective, as is my own. Though I would never claim that my way is the only way, or the best way, it is simply my way. As I have stated before, I love to speculate and to talk about my, and others, speculation. First of all theories tend to be general, so the exact details of how things play out is unforeseeable. Secondly to cultivate my pet theory just to be proven entirely wrong is a great source of enjoyment and stimulation for me. As is cultivating my pet theory just to be proven right in some regards. Both entertains me. In fact a show that I am willing to invest such degrees of mental dedication is always a much greater source of entertainment then shows were I feel no such involvement.

If we're to assume it reflects the ethnic make-up of the British population as a whole. Therefore there's no great controversy about them having disproportionately more white characters than you'd find in a real East End neighbourhood. This is a show which gives black and asian actors the chance to play well rounded, interesting characters in dramatic and challenging story lines. I know 99% of redditors hate soaps, but Eastenders has some of the best writing and acting on television. As to the black and asian characters having negative story lines, I don't recognise the legitimacy of that criticism, all of the characters have negative and positive story lines, heck even Janine does the occasional good deed, even Dot sins every once in a while. Giving the black and asian characters only positive story lines would be patronising and would mean that the characters were just tokens, which they are not.

If this is your blog - definitely start at the revamp (so Eccleston, the ninth doctor). There are a whole bunch of resources available to you, especially because you found this subreddit :) There are a bunch of links on the side that should help and guide you.

If you're in the states, I think netflix has all the season on demand, but I could be wrong? It's well worth the 7.99 a month (and I know in Canada we have a deal on right now - first month is free). If you don't have a credit card or the cash to spare, I can suggest a bunch of not so legal ways of acquiring the series. There are a bunch of websites out there that have all of the episodes online. I can even give you hints and tips because that's how I watched it.

Bonus: if you're in Ontario, and/or anywhere near Toronto, I have the whole series on my laptop.

Good luck! I hope you catch up in time to watch the new season unfold.

true,borez,cnty-england,Geordie in London,"Ten years ago I went through a similar thing with a credit card, I was doing a lot of music for advertising and had about £3,000 on one card when I lost both my parents in the same year and my world went totally pair-shaped, I was so traumatised I couldn't write music for shit. I mean try writing a McDonald's jingle when all you can think about is your dead parents, happy fucking burger music doesn't exactly flow in this situation. 

Anyway cut to my writing partner couldn't handle the fact that every contract we were tendering was being knocked back ( I was always the one who landed the contracts, not him )  we fell out big time and went our separate ways i.e. my income dried up and so did the credit card payments. Oh and FTR that card protection insurance ain't worth shit, they find a technicality and basically don't pay up. It's worthless, one big fucking scam. 

A year on, the debt had tripled and they basically started harassing me with phone calls, probably 20-40 a day, 7 days a week, at all hours. Then they started to threaten me with home visits, it became a nightmare. It was harassment plain and simple and for a few months it completely took over my life. FTR I tried many times to explain my situation and work out some kind of payment plan but it was never enough, it fell on deaf ears and the debt just kept on spiralling out of control. It became well over £10,000 and that's pretty much loan shark territory in my book. I did manage to get them to set up a payment plan and freeze the amount through citizens advice, but a month on they went back on their word and the harassment started again. 


In the end I just thought fuck them, my lease was up so when I moved I kept my name off the electoral register, put the utilities in my flatmates name and basically went dark. Nine years later, I've moved several times since but I've never heard another word from them. I'm sure it'll rear its ugly head one day though. 

Now I'm not saying I'm proud of doing this, I mean I can't vote now and/or get any kind of credit ( not that I want or need any ) but there wasn't another option at the time because they weren't giving me one.  

I guess the moral of this story is: Watch your back with credit cards, your life gets shook up, you lose your job or your source of income and they can get out of control before you even realise at a ridiculous rate. Then the harassment starts. But... that's what they want, they want you up to your eyeballs in debt, it's how they make their money.

To conclude: I'm glad this guy won his court case, credit card companies are, In my opinion, fucking scum.

DLA is designed specifically to help support disabled people in living a normal life, which is why they are protesting about possible cuts to it.

As for employment support allowance, which you do only get if you aren’t working, I don’t buy the argument that by receiving these benefits people are being opted out of work. They would likely be happier and wealthier if they were working, and previously would be able to do so when they felt able to do so (although I believe even incapacity benefit was regularly re-assessed, the idea that people were stuck on it for life without being re-assessed is a myth). Under the new system people on ESA are under the almost constant possibility of being re-assessed but not by their GP or even necessarily by a qualified doctor but by a nurse who has never met them who uses a 15 minute interview to assign them a score under a set of rigid criteria. Whether or not someone gets ESA under this method is more by luck than judgement, which is why disabled charities and disabled people widely condemn these medical tests and the company behind them, Atos.

But again, this type of categorization needs to be done by medical professionals.

I understand there are appointments, and the Canadian system is not best (I'm actually a dual national, and I note every single member of the Canadian senate is from either the Liberal or the Conservative party) however I have seen lots of bad legistlation not make it past the senate- to which I owe a gratitude.

The problem really with the house of lords today is it is overwhelmingly tory minded in a nation which isn't so much. (reflecting the lords themselves naturally)

I think at the end of the day the way you set up the government  reflects how much faith you have in the system.

Saying whether or not he was really dead in the last episode is iffy on either side. Should no one have done anything, he would have died for sure.

Well, maybe that's a part of it. There are so many occasions where his character has some old fashioned ideas of chivalry and the like. There are times that he, an old man, will take over something being done by Barbara, who is clearly more physically capable than he is, but that ye olde machismo takes over and he mucks it up and slows down the progress old man style.

Of course, that's more about the times than it is about the character.

He's also less powerful, more of a dick about little things, and more vulnerable than the more recent doctors, but the character obviously gained a huge number of capabilities over time and experience.

Amy's Choice introduced us to some major concepts of Series 6. Amy's Pregnancy, alternate realities (in the form of dreams), and the dark side of the Doctor. Also I think Amy actually having to make a choice will be important. 

(Spoilers if you haven't seen the latest 3 episodes.) 

We've been introduced to the concept of Amy being ""quantum pregnant"". Two possible realities, universes, timelines. I believe Amy will have to make a very hard choice to determine what reality she wants to occur. 

We have also been introduced to the concept of traveling through universes in the form of reflections. There have been various posts citing every example of a reflection when something wonky occurs. There are so many examples, like the lake the astronaut walks out of, the astronauts helmut. A mirror being present when Amy tells the doctor she is pregnant. The most startling example of a reflection, after watching Amy's Choice, is the Doctor seeing *the dream lords reflection* in the glass of the tardis!! 

Amy is having visions of the Eye Patch Lady. Who also has a shiny silver eyepatch. (Which in itself is another reflection.) What's sort of too coincidental to shrug off, is that when amy was *awake* in the Impossible Astronaut/Day Of the Moon, Eyepatch Lady said, 'I think she's just dreaming.' meaning she was probably *asleep* in the other universe. When she was *asleep* in the pirate episode, the Eyepatch Lady is talking to her as if she was *awake.* She's awake in one universe and asleep in the other. Sound like the Dreamlord episode?

true,in_somnis_veritas,null,null,"Well, as I see it, hypothetically there are three options to consider when discussing Madeleine:

1. She was abducted. If any adult had been there, the abductor would probably have gone elsewhere or had they decided to go through with it, odds are one or both Parents would have tried to prevent it. I am a parent and would never allow someone to walk in and take my child without making a concerted effort to stop them. So, Madeleine would not have been taken and would still be alive. 

2. Madeleine had some form of accident and died. Again, as Doctors, her parents would have been there to provide first aid etc. So again, Madeleine would still be alive. 

3. Someone known to the family or within the family itself killed her. As far as I can see, this is the only explanation where my previous assertion could be flawed, and the presence of an adult would not have prevented her death. Of course, this means assuming her parents are either guilty or protecting someone.

I am sorry but it is never, ever okay to leave a four year old to be the default care-giver for two three year olds. As the eldest in the house, she was basically in charge of her siblings. This is not a situation where you leave a ten year old and a seven year old alone while you pop to the shops, this is a situation where TODDLERS were left in a strange room in an unfamiliar place and it should not be excused by the ""we've all done it"" school of thought. We have not ""all done it"", and I am concerned that leaving children who are practically babies alone is being excused as responsible parenting.

TL;DR= It's never okay to leave SMALL children unsupervised.
