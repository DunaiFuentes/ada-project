RTD handed you everything on a plate. Everyone's motivations were plain, and, to be honest I never had to turn my brain on to watch his version of Doctor Who. The sad thing is that if you started watching in 2005, you think this is *what made the show*, when in fact the show was an icon and already amazing before 2005, WAY before, and one of the reasons was that you had to *THINK* to get what was going on and read between the lines. Moffatt's Who is a *RETURN* to what made Doctor Who great in the first place, and I welcome it and love it dearly.

A) The Silence are obviously a bunch of evil pricks who already have targeted the Doctor to do horrible shit to him, and have been doing horrible shit to time and to humans and to well, all of reality. There is nothing to be gained by trying to reason with them, as they obviously know a lot about the Doctor and if they wanted to reason with him instead of kill him, they'd probably have thought about doing so. So yeah, fuck teh Silence. I can't believe you even think that sitting down with them is an option at this point. 

B) The TARDIS exploding was obviously done by the Silence or someone behind the Silence. Does it seem to you like the story behind the Silence is over with after the S6 finale? No? Me neither. Patience, grasshopper.

C) Eleven is an amazing Doctor. Of course he cares and is a good man. He's been manipulated and forced into situations he can't control. He tried to help the FISH PEOPLE WHO WEREN'T VAMPIRES AT ALL, and the queen bitch flat out refused to be helped in a way that didn't kill all the humans. AWWW POOR FISH PEOPLE WHO WOULDN'T LISTEN TO REASON. Whatever. As to erasing old Amy from existence, well, better than leaving them all to die. Unforgivable my ass. The whole point was that sometimes the Doctor has to do things that might not be very nice so that the outcome is at least better than ""oops everyone dies because I had to give the one person who could help the exact opposite of any motivation to do so.""

I really was trying to be nice, so sorry if I come off as an asshole, but you really seem like not only do you not get it, you aren't even really trying anymore. I hope the chorus of braindead haters who want their Doctor Who spoonfed to them (aka ""I like it when the TARDIS goes Vwoorp Vwoorp and what is moral grey area? I don't even..."") has a really cool clubhouse and door prizes because I am amazed there are so many of you now. And now I'm scared you're all going to kill my favorite show of 26 years *AGAIN* because you can't turn your brains on and *think* about what you see and try to read between the lines.

true,Piemonkey,null,null,"Well, there is also the factor that Eccleston was a first season Doctor, for all intents and purposes of a new series. How many shows can you name where the first season is anywhere near the quality of the following seasons? The characters aren't really established yet, the show is still developing a direction it wants to go in, the producers and executives are looking for a target demographic, etc.

Adding to that, we have all this for a show with almost 40 years of history and an already established fanbase that doesn't know what to think or expect. This really just compounds the first season jitters.

A lot of people blame the writing and, while it was pretty weak, there were a bunch of other factors that people seem to overlook at play. Eccleston not fitting in with certain people is yet another but I have a hard time believing that would come out through his performance. Up until his revelation of that little snippet earlier this year, I've never heard people say that he was not enjoying the role or the show, only that he did not want to be typecasted. Otherwise, people just didn't like how blunt or grumpy or PTSD he was.

In the end, I'm certain Eccleston was chosen for his acting abilities and because everyone overseeing the show felt he could portray the ninth Doctor best. However, he had to deal with a number of things Tennant and Smith likely never did: new show, low budget, being physically ill, establishing a new tone for a 40 year old canon, etc. Could another actor have done it just as well, or better? Maybe. Can you say that for certain? No. At least, not without undermining Eccleston's abilities. 

I point you toward the scene when he first meets Rose and they're in the elevator. Eccleston's dialogue with Rose was short, to the point, dismissive and completely fantastical. He wasn't interested in explaining what was going on to a stranger, no matter how strange the things he just said were. Would you imagine Smith or Tennant portraying a curt, PTSD Doctor or more as their established selves? I can't help but think Smith would have been much more comical and roundabout with his delivery of the dialogue WITH WAVERING volume of WORDS to portray HIMSELF AS AN aloof-minded ALIEN genius. As for Tennant, I can't help but see him being overly excited at the thought of alien activity and running through a dozen thoughts at once before realizing that he's scaring Rose, who has no idea what the hell is going on. And, like you said, we all love these two for that Doctor we know them as. However, if any of them *was* the ninth Doctor, would they be anything like their current selves at all? I doubt it. He's supposed to be a darker, brooding Doctor with much less of the clownishness we love 10 and 11 for. I'm positive anyone who doesn't like Eccleston's Doctor would be in the same position now if anyone else played the ninth, including Smith or Tennant. 

The only other complaint I ever see is because someone doesn't think Eccleston acted well, which is complete BS. Dalek had some of the finest acting out of the new series. I've seen the tenth *do* scary things and I've seen the eleventh be incredibly intimidating with his quiet anger (gentle man and all that) but the ninth was properly terrifying as a Doctor.",0,1317748936,null,0,false,0,c2ot1cq,t3_l0521,t1_c2ot1cq,t1_c2oshku,1427685447,1,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,1

I also know plenty of people, usually but not always, from down south who get angry when you call the midday meal ""dinner"", but they tend not to mind the evening meal being called ""tea"".

But ultimately, the argument is fundamentally stupid. ""Dinner"" refers to cooked meal originally, and the culture (huge sweeping generalisations incoming) up north traditionally was to eat a hot meal at midday/early afternoon, whereas down south the culture was to have that meal in the evening.


Technically, you're wrong if you call an uncooked meal, for example a sandwich, (whether taken at midday or in the evening) ""dinner"", or if you call a cooked meal ""lunch"", whether taken at midday or in the evening.

But, it also doesn't matter really, some people call the evening meal ""tea"", others ""dinner"". Some call the midday meal ""Lunch"", others ""dinner"".

- The Question of River Song was so much more entertaining than The Answer. As soon as I figured out who she was (about 5 minutes into the big reveal episode) I was immediately diappointed. It felt like such an obvious cop out for such an entertaining and mysterious character. I almost immediately lost all interest in River, whom I had spent the entire time between seasons anxiously awaiting more of. With all the build up over who she was, they seemed to almost entirely ignore it in the second half of the season, and when it was brought up, I didn't really care.
-Three's company - I love Amy, and I love Rory, but I really dislike The Doctor, Amy, and Rory, at least this season, when they basically just repeated the same tropes of last season, to a far less entertaining degree. I was all aboard for the Doctor and Red show for a while, but without the romantic connection, the relationship feel sorta flat with me this season. 
-The way they explained the doctor dying in the finale seemed like such a cop out to me. I was very disappointed.

This season wasn't without its charm, of course, but I think they've written themselves into a rather tricky situation. Even if they do give the doctor a new companion next season, I worry about the connection that they will have, what with the doctor being involved romantically with River. I love alex kingston, and if they can figure out a way to get her going the right way through time again, and act as the new companion, that would be pretty awesome. Hopefully if they go that route they can do it in a way that isn't too cheesy.

true,Gaderael,cyberman,Cyberperson,"I thought that the second half of the season was about The Doctor weening Amy off her unshakable faith in him, because of his inability to save Melody/River.

She was The Girl Who Waited.  She trusted the Doctor to accomplish anything he said he would.  She has seen him save the world and the universe time and again.  Of course he would be able to save her baby.

The second half of the season seemed to be about teaching her the cold, hard reality that the Doctor is not infallible.  In ""The Girl Who Waited"" she was shown that when the Doctor could not save her and she was left alone for decades.  Her older self talks about her growing hatred of The Doctor.  It was telling that she made a robot companion of Rory and not him to keep her sane over all those years.  then ou have the ""The God Complex"" where she finally has to rid herself of her faith in The Doctor in order to save herself, and finally in ""Closing Time"" where we see that she has moved on, to the  point of almost making fun of her self with the line on the ad ""For the Girl Who Is Tired Of Waiting"".

In ""The Wedding Of River Song"" when River pops in on them at their home talking about how she just came from the Byzantium, Amy's and Rory's reaction to her being there seems to suggest that this was not the first time she has done so.  There's also the way that River casually calls her mother which would allude to them having a relationship outside of what we have seen on screen.  So, while Amy may have missed out on River's formative years (if you do not count their relationship as friends growing up), she has developed a relationship wih River now, which may alleviate some of the loss from losing her as a child.",0,1317752087,null,0,true,0,c2otij3,t3_l0ir8,t1_c2otij3,t3_l0ir8,1427685671,5,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,5

Like I said, I've never seen anything else he's been in.  So he may be a capable actor who's deserved whatever awards he's been given.

I'm only going on his performance as the Doctor, which I have seen a lot of.  I couldn't watch the whole first season becuase it was just so bad.  But I've watched a lot of it.

Dalek was a good example of what was wrong with the writing in that first season.  Dalek torture?  No thank you.

His acting in it wasn't exceptionally bad compared with the rest of the season but it wasn't very good.  Getting angry is about the easiest thing to do as an actor.  

But he wasn't even very good at that.  There's just always this stiltedness to everything he says.  Even when he's shouting.  

I don't believe him.  I don't believe he's really angry.  He seems to be trying very hard to convince me.  But I just can't believe it.

Take one of the good episodes like The Empty Child and you have an example of how his acting could hurt even good writing.

That scene at the end should have been perfect, and it would have with either Smith or Tennant, but instead his acting drags it down.

I don't believe him.  He's stilted and awkward and acts like he knows I'm watching.

Sorry, that's my opinion.  I actually think a lot of people agree with me.  Most Who fans I know personally agree he wasn't a very good Doctor, and not just because of the writing.

This is a pro Eccleston post so it makes sense most of the people bothering to comment would like him.  But I really have to say that he just did not do a good job and I think that's been the general fan consensus for a while.

I'm sorry, maybe he can act, but for whatever reason he was not good when he was acting as the Doctor.  He was painful to watch.",0,1317752581,null,0,true,0,c2otl8b,t3_l0521,t1_c2otl8b,t1_c2ot995,1427685706,3,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,3

For the OP:
As for the Doctor lying, and anything that seems ""unforgivable"" to people watching the show... The Doctor is almost a thousand years old. And experience wise you can probably double that because of all the time travel and skipping over the boring bits. How many beings has he seen die? How many has he left behind? How many has he killed? That's not even considering what may or may not have happened in the time war. And the fact that he blames himself for wiping out his entire race.

So, is he supposed to get all emotional and tortured every time he has to make a hard decision? All in all, when you have lived a thousand years. both witnessed and caused billions of deaths, wiped out whole species before breakfast, and the universe still finds new horrors to toss out at you...

You're mixing opinion, that you don't like his portrayal/the ninth Doctor's personality, with objectivity, that he acted ""badly"".

Just because you've arrived at some strongly worded, yet vague, conclusions doesn't make them fact or even good observations. I mean, what was wrong with that scene in The Empty Child? All I can see you saying is ""**I** didn't like it."" Well, that's great. *How* was it bad? Did you want him to run around and do cartwheels or something? Maybe dance around and do a handstand?

I do understand your point about Moffat. I am a huge Moffat fan. A true one. Being a true Moffat fan will mean two things. One: You love Moffat. Two: Moffat pisses you off. 

He's very good at tricking the audience and taking the most far-fetched ideas and making them work, but the problem with him is that he can get carried away fairly easily. He went completely woop-da-dee-doo with River Song and I won't go into why I severely dislike her entire plotline and instead just say that everything about the events involving her is really, ridiculously over the top to the point where even Moffat's legendary wits can't save it. 

He introduced this very ambitious, very complicated story arc that could've been brilliant (and it was pretty, good really - I enjoyed it personally), but it was just too big of a bite for him. He couldn't carry it out without resorting to some obvious plot-resolutions, cheap cop-outs and he left a handful of inconsistencies behind (which, in all honesty, I am kind of hoping he WILL explain in episodes to come)

I am kind of hoping that this negative feedback he's gotten, both in terms of fanbase reactions and the supposed drop in ratings, will serve as a 'slap on the wrist' of sorts and he'll shape up for the next storyline, tone things down just a speck and perhaps devote more time to Doctor's adventures.

But where would one stop when it comes to ""free living"" as it were? I'm sure you agree that when it comes to legislation with regards certain things like processed food, the public need to be protected from groups/companies that might look to cut corners or reduce their costs by using substandard ingredients that would harm the customer. Trans fats, for example. Products could be labelled, but I think the state works assuming consumer apathy holds sway. For example 'everyone' knows fast food isn't a good thing but still people people flock to MaccyD's.

Also you'd have to address laws that stop people from doing certain things/consuming certain goods under a particular (somewhat arbitrary) age: No cigarettes under 18 (or is it 16, but you can't buy it under 18?); No alcohol (effectively) under 18, etc.

How could the ""anything goes"" (so long as it doesn't harm others) idea justify stopping people under a certain age from taking part in a particular activity?

My parents earn literally a few hundered pounds over the limit for recieving EMA, so I recieved nothing, and had to work for the money I earned. It's not like I needed a maintenence allowance for my education anyway. Going to 6th form was free, and most material was provided for free anyway. If I didn't have a pen, I could borrow one. If I had no paper, I could get some from recources.

To me - EMA seems like a terrible idea. Giving a low income child benefits isn't really showing them the value of money. It teaches them that being low income means you get free money. How is this supposed to motivate them to get a job, and EARN money? Most people on EMA would earn more money a month than I would from working in a retail shop on minimum wage. How is this fair? Not a single person I have ever come across has NEEDED the money they were being given. 

A system involving vouchers would have been a much better means of supporting these kids, and I think many people wouldn't even bother to apply for EMA if it was voucher based, because they literally don't need it.

true,Herak,eu,"Glasgow ","The script to be broadcast in the event of the cold war becoming hot:

&gt; This is the Wartime Broadcasting Service. This country has been attacked with nuclear weapons. Communications have been severely disrupted, and the number of casualties and the extent of the damage are not yet known. We shall bring you further information as soon as possible. Meanwhile, stay tuned to this wavelength, stay calm and stay in your own house.

&gt;Remember there is nothing to be gained by trying to get away. By leaving your homes you could be exposing yourself to greater danger.
If you leave, you may find yourself without food, without water, without accommodation and without protection. Radioactive fall-out, which follows a nuclear explosion, is many times more dangerous if you are directly exposed to it in the open. Roofs and walls offer substantial protection. The safest place is indoors. Make sure gas and other fuel supplies are turned off and that all fires are extinguished. If mains water is available, this can be used for fire-fighting. You should also refill all your containers for drinking water after the fires have been put out, because the mains water supply may not be available for very long.

&gt;Water must not be used for flushing lavatories: until you are told that lavatories may be used again, other toilet arrangements must be made. Use your water only for essential drinking and cooking purposes. Water means life. Don't waste it.
Make your food stocks last: ration your supply, because it may have to last for 14 days or more. If you have fresh food in the house, use this first to avoid wasting it: food in tins will keep.

&gt;If you live in an area where a fall-out warning has been given, stay in your fall-out room until you are told it is safe to come out. When the immediate danger has passed the sirens will sound a steady note. The ""all clear"" message will also be given on this wavelength. If you leave the fall-out room to go to the lavatory or replenish food or water supplies, do not remain outside the room for a minute longer than is necessary.
Do not, in any circumstances, go outside the house. Radioactive fall-out can kill. You cannot see it or feel it, but it is there. If you go outside, you will bring danger to your family and you may die. Stay in your fall-out room until you are told it is safe to come out or you hear the ""all clear"" on the sirens.

&gt;Here are the main points again: Stay in your own homes, and if you live in an area where a fall-out warning has been given stay in your fall-out room, until you are told it is safe to come out. The message that the immediate danger has passed will be given by the sirens and repeated on this wavelength. Make sure that the gas and all fuel supplies are turned off and that all fires are extinguished. Water must be rationed, and used only for essential drinking and cooking purposes. It must not be used for flushing lavatories. Ration your food supply--it may have to last for 14 days or more.
We shall be on the air every hour, on the hour. Stay tuned to this wavelength, but switch your radios off now to save your batteries. That is the end of this broadcast.

Her death was supposed to inspire her grand daughter. She killed herself because The Doctor had told her before he saved her that she had to die.  I think what TWORS shows us, if anything, is that fixed points are fixed because of the things that they cause afterward.  The universe believing the Doctor was killed is what was necessary, not necessarily that he actually die.   Also we probably saw him start to regenerate before because that him hadn't thought of his way out.  He actually was killed, but the Doctor was able to re-write time but in a way that still works.

Vanilla Amy doesn't have much depth. This is why in The Girl Who Waited, I didn't really care about the saying goodbye part. It was supposed to be emotional, but I just felt like... meh. Back to boring young Amy. No emotional connection there.

Moffat has added in the sheer vastness and complexity of the overarching storyline, but I feel like the series has lost a bit of its innocence.

If we put aside the money issues, it would still take years for electrification to take effect on a large enough scale to make it worthwhile.

There's no way anyone would think 40 years ahead (remember that BR was already considering ""HST 2"" with the APT in the 80s - the HST wasn't really expected to be used in the way it was today) and somehow be psychic enough to come up with the very justification for why we need to look at a non-fossil fuel future today.

Remember also that electrification can't always happen on technical grounds. The first region of BR to get the HST was the Western region - which includes places like Cornwall with its varied terrain and millions of viaducts.

At the end of the Empty Child I wanted to believe his performance and not find it difficult to bear the awkward delivery of his lines.

That's all.

You need to calm down.  I'm not saying you can't like Eccleston.  You obviously do, a lot.

I'm not receptive to only a goofy and whimsical Doctor with flashes of anger.  I'm just not receptive to someone who's boring.  The Doctor is such a fascinating and mysterious character.  Its not acceptable to play him boring.

This brings up another thought on what was so lacking in his performance.  There was no depth, no mystery.  All of the good Doctors have been able to show at least hints of something more lurking under the surface.

Eccleston was all wooden surface.

There's not much more I can say.  If I could somehow psychically link with you to fully convey my sense of how lacking Eccleston was maybe we could advance.

He strings Martha along until she *forces* him to say whether or not she can travel with him. From then on he suggests Rose would know what to do (yeah right), takes her to the same places he took Rose (except she gets the sketchy part), takes refuge in a time where she is persecuted for her skin colour, gets her to travel a raped world for a year - and she does, *because she loves him*, even though he never reciprocated.

The reason why I find this worse than anything the Eleventh Doctor has done is because it is so *personal*. He (unconsciously?) digs the knife in deeper.

Pre labour their were much fewer statutory ""laws"" like the smoking ban. Adults who make lifestyle choices that are unpopular but don't endanger others should be free to do engage in them wherever it is sex or smoking. 

You're right in that I agree with regulations if you're a business and you want to tell food then it should be safe. Corporations value profit over everything so they have to be controlled. People should be free and if someone wants to buy trans fats for their personal use then whatever. Companies should not be able to sell what is effectively poison as food though. Maccy D's is the same as smoking, people are free to enjoy their lives at a risk in some areas (fast food), but get taxed to hell in others (smoking) and some are just illegal (drugs). It is not consistent. 

Anything goes is only for adults. If we let people drive 100mph metal things on wheels then we should let people eat a plant or go tombstoning. Our bodies are our own, not the governments, and particularly not one never represents most of our interests. 

As for heroin, like all drugs, people who want it can get it no problem right now. If it being illegal prevented its distribution then fine, but it hasn't. Instead, we can make it available through a doctor like the pill, you get advice, support, educated on how to take it safely and the harms it causes, as well as that people can take something they know isn't tainted. And fuck heroin anyway, it's a shitty derivative, they can have opium. Switzerland is a great example of how much crime fell when they engaged with the addicts and stopped them having to steal to fund their habit. A proper heroin addiction can cost 40k a year and most people don't earn that, thus crime. Tax it to fund the services and you've also created a legitimate industry, plus we can stop destroying the crops of farmers in afghanistan who are only trying to survive. And we can help get rid of gangs who survive off drug money. Legalisation is the only rational thing to do, in my opinion.

Think about a husband/wife that is brain dead, or just had a massive stroke, or had been in a accident, and can not make decisions about his/hers treatment or well being? Sans a living will, the burden is rightfully placed on the other spouse. This is exactly what the Doctor did, because I think in a heart beat the Doctor would have picked the younger Amy and left. And he could have done that but he didn't he did the only moral thing in that situation and left it to Rory, Amy's husband, who in turn discussed it with his future wife which concluded in them not letting her in.

Given that he isn't a god, which option would you count as doing the right thing? Remember to account for the fact that his preferred solution was ""play taxi to the spider people"".

He locked them away in various different ways so that they would be alive for eternity - but trapped.

Perhaps not entirely the nicest thing he had ever done, but he didn't *ask* them to hunt him down and use his life force to power an inter galactic killing spree.

RTD wrote very character-centric seasons - every companion's story was linked back up to their families and lives and even the secondary characters were pretty thoroughly fleshed out as individuals, and he seemed to make a point of diversity in casting. His weak point was plotting - the season finales especially got more and more over the top and unbelievable.

Moffat works the opposite way - his storylines are intricately plotted (which is frankly reasonable in an era of DVRs and DVD sets), loose ends usually carefully sewn up, and it really builds upon the legacy of 50 years worth of lore. His weak point is characterization - you'll note that unlike RTD-era companions Amy, Rory, and River never really mention or interact with their families, just each other; supporting characters tend to have less depth and less diversity. There's a level of stereotyping around male-female interactions that's uncomfortable at times.

So plot-driven fans who really enjoy unravelling mysteries or watching everything come together in 'Aha!' moments really like the Moffat era and a lot of the more extreme ones look at the RTD era as almost a kind of soap opera.

Character-driven fans who really enjoy watching the interactions between the Doctor and his companions really like the RTD era and a lot of the more extreme ones look at the Moffat era as almost a kind of self-indulgent wankery.

true,Saintbaba,null,null,"I agree with a few of your points, but i'm going to have to go to bat against your assertion that Moffat has hurt character. Moffat's the one that's *saved* character on this show. To be honest, it sounds like your biggest complaint is that the Doctor isn't perfect anymore. Now he's fallible. He makes mistakes. He's manipulative, and he lies, and - as you point out with the moment in ""The Girl Who Waited"" - while he can be brave with monsters, he can be a coward when it comes to emotions. 

And while i'm not sure this will convince you, i just have to say: that's the best thing Moffat has done for the show. The Doctor is a mortal again. The Doctor's choices matter, now, because he is no longer a mary sue supergod paragon of virtue who always does the right thing every time. And if being somewhat flawed in the heart makes you ""a complete dick,"" then we're all complete dicks, because we all lie a little and manipulate the people around us a little and make a few wrong choices here and there.

The best characters, the most compelling characters, are imperfect ones. Characters who don't always win; who cannot always overcome themselves. Because otherwise, what's the point? Darkness doesn't have to be the only defining characteristic, but up and down are relative terms, and the rise has no meaning without the risk of falling.

Subpoint: i think you may have misunderstood what happened with Flesh Amy at the end of that storyline - specifically, she wasn't an independent being that the Doctor killed, she was just a receptacle that Real Amy's mind was being transmitted to. In fact, even using the terms Flesh Amy and Real Amy is silly, because there was only ever one Amy, whose perceptions were split between two bodies.

Rory made a similar one in Vampire of Venice - he accused the Doctor of making people want to impress him. And it's kinda true.

Lorna wasn't? Moffat's idea was that because the Doctor had seemingly spent a lot of life at war, the title ""Doctor"" meant warrior to another world. Here, it means 'healer', but not in the Gamma Forests.

Of course, a soldier would have been more practical and not negotiated with an enemy that has continually refused negotiation in the past - and thus guaranteed the Daleks would have been defeated.

""Heroes"" aren't always very practical, and often rely on an author to make their strategically unwise plans work out.

You dispense with fostering an inverted mother-daughter relationship between Amy and River and instead foster a genuine friendship between two women. You don't need to dump in a new character essential to Amy's childhood five minutes before she 'dies'. You don't need to give and then remove regeneration energy from an established character. You can get more distance out of the search for Melody Pond, provide closure for Amy and/or watch Amy develop into a mother who lost her child and how she deals with it.

true,BarelyReal,null,null,"There are some points I definitely agree with, especially the Moffat tropes. I don't however see this as an inherent fault as you find this in all writers in one way or another, and I haven't found Moffat to tell the story in the same way. The pieces may be the same, but his strength in all his work has been in how he tells the story more so than the story itself. 

I will also concede that Moffat's work does tend to appear misogynistic, however I also believe people read more malice into it than I believe is present in his work. Coupling, imho, shows that Moffat writes men and women distinctively with their own strengths and faults and roles in society. He doesn't have the same idealism that RTD had, so I think a lot of that will only stand out more following RTD. 

I noticed that the author seemed more insulted at the a-moral nature that Moffat has been writing The Doctor than anything else, or at least that's what a lot of it comes back to. If you look at The Doctor as the righteous do gooder then yeah, a lot of S6 doesn't make much sense. If you look at The Doctor as a completely a-moral character then it all falls into place a bit more. Call me cynical, but I had no problem with how Amy and Rory were used this series because I saw them as nothing more than The Doctor's ""tools"". The Doctor lies, but he also screws people up.

true,CaseyStevens,null,null,"I think season 5 was about as good a Doctor Who season as you could get.  He introduced Amy Pond, one of the better companions, and built a compelling overarching storyline involving her and her relationship with the Doctor and Rory and time.  

A storyline that commented on every companion relationship the Doctor has had in the past.

He further explored some of the badass characteristics of the Tennant era while setting the stage for a bit of the darker stuff next season and a more introspective Doctor.

Along the way there were wonderful episodes that could easily stand on their own like ""The Eleventh Hour"" and ""Amy's Choice"" and ""Vincent and the Doctor"" and ""The Lodger.""

It was a wonderful beautiful season.

This last season started out strong with ""The Impossible Astronaut"" and ""Day of the Moon"" but then got a little aimless.

Frankly, I think part of the problem was the long delay between episodes, which kind of threw both the writers and the audience off-track.

Hopefully it won't happen that way again.  BBC...

There were still many wonderful episodes and moments in this last season, but too many episodes like ""A Good Man Goes To War"" had a big build up without enough payoff.

We'll still look back at these last two seasons years from now as a moment when everything was in place from the production to the writing to the acting.  Its a golden age and classic television is being made.

How many mysteries from season 5 are really even left? About the only thing I can think of is why exactly The Silence blew up the TARDIS, although one could say it could be implied that it was just part of the plot to kill Doctor.

And, honestly, why would you want him to answer mysteries so quickly? I mean some, sure, but all of them? That would defeat their purpose. If he did that then there would have been no mystery left to ride into the next season, such as who exactly are The Silent, and why exactly do they want Doctor dead? Just as it would have been if they answered who River Song was last season. We wouldn't have it to carry us over to this season.

The TARDIS materializes in the clubroom, the Doctor pokes his head out, notices the five of them staring straight at him, draws his head back in, and dematerializes. Ten seconds later, he's back, stuck there because Haruhi is keeping him there with her reality warper powers.

Gurren Lagann: The Doctor argues matters of ethics with the anti-spirals. Ridiculous mech battles ensue.

Little Britain: It turns out that the narrator is actually an alternate-universe version of the Fourth Doctor who never regenerated and is, in fact, going senile. 

Girl Genius: The Doctor arrives in Castle Heterodyne as Agatha is repairing it. Not only does he outsmart the Castle's AI, he offers Agatha some sparky suggestions on how to improve the castle. Captain Jack flirts with Gil.

My Little Pony, Friendship is Magic: It turns out that Doctor Whooves and Colgate are actually the Doctor and Romana, trapped in the Ponyverse, a universe where any humanoid (or Timelordoid) being who enters it is turned into a pony. Hilarity ensues as he interacts with the Mane 6.

Hamlet: The Doctor shows up near the end, saves Hamlet, and then they do the whole ""Time can be rewritten"" thing, a la Hamlet 2.

Homestuck: There is so much wibbly wobbly timey wimey stuff (referred to by Homestuck fans as, ""weird time shit"") that the Doctor wouldn't seem too out of place here.

Red Dwarf: I'd say that he finds the guys a way home, but apparently they make it home, so I have no idea what would happen.

Dead Like Me: George gets a call for a dead Time Lord, but when she finds out that the Doctor's death, despite being a fixed point, was faked, she becomes involved in the task of tracking the Doctor throughout history. Either that, or she meets each of the Doctor's incarnations shortly before regeneration.

The Rocky Horror Picture Show: The Doctor takes Amy and Rory to the planet Transsexual in the galaxy of Transylvania, where they meet Frank, Riff, and Magenta, prompting their original voyage to Earth. They then visit Frank's mansion (or, where it was) after the events of the film. Hilarity ensues.

A language sculptor, a moulder of exploding stars and spinning galaxies, empires of glass and song, creating with the utmost care and perfection, each in delicate balance.

As for a TARDIS, I don't know about an exterior, but the interior would be (obviously) larger on the inside. Except the inside would be like stepping into outer space, with hundreds of floating and moving platforms, some with couches and chairs, others with beds and libraries and such. All around you could see stars and nebulous gaseous clouds of color constantly moving and shifting about (possibly reflecting the current state of an actual location in space), and a star (sun) would cast a dusky glow on the platforms as they drifted about. I think the platforms themselves would have a pattern that's a cross between an old fashion sundial with roman numerals and Gallifreyan writing.

How would you get from each platform? by will of thought you could float yourself over to whatever location. For that reason would the console be hovering in the centre of the ""space"". How would I hover? Telepathic circuits and zero gravity field.

When I think of an exterior I think of libraries, ancient Greek architecture? cathedrals... a book store. Really no idea, but that's the vibe I get.

As for my attitude...I don't know. When I pictured this, I imagined some lone wanderer going about the universe quietly tinkering about and dropping in wonders. I got that vibe from the crystal structure Dr. Manhattan created in the Watchmen movie.

But I'd probably go adventuring like the Doctor. get myself into trouble. I guess if I was in a different mood I could shift the outerspace theme and make it..sunny or tropical or whatever.

What would I wear? Probably something very Edwardian. Whatever it is, very tailored, very sharp cut. Think peacoats, waistcoats, vests, double breasted coats, jackets and such. Black boots, definitely no doubt a pocketwatch. Though I'd probably wear it as a necklace. Gloves? maybe. I'd definitely have some sort of overcoat that went to my knees.

true,[deleted],null,null,"as cliche and unoriginal as it sounds, I actually quite like the Doctor as a name and has been my steam handle since before I was a whovian (I mostly played medic in TF2) though now I use a portrait of the doctor as a user image.

as for what a theoretical pocket of relative time and space in its own dimension would look like for me, well I don't know. I mean it could look like anything, but it can't be too big or too small and has to have a door. otherwise it would look weird. possibly some sort of call box similar to what the Doctor in the actual whoiverse uses, but different in its own way. Perhaps some sort of statue or tree with a door built in.

As for the inside of the TARDIS, it would obviously have to be larger on the inside, as that's a given. I would like a central control area near the door, equipped with the essentials. Flight controls, monitors, phone, you get the idea. I like the idea of the controls being made from everyday earth objects. The phone would be corded, and be made of two pieces, much like phones were when they were first made. Lots of buttons and switches from arcade machines to piano keys to the style of toggle switches one finds on coffee makers to an old fashioned mechanical typewriter. I love the ""hacked together"" feel of the latest two TARDIS themes and  I would carry on the tradition.

Around the main control area would be a couch or seating area or two, more secluded than they have been in the recent TARDISes, but just as included with the area design. There would be walls, of course, but they would have some portholes, windows out into the void or views of the planet around us. The halls would be a more standard rectangular shape, with soft lights from overhead and warm colors, possibly a shade of red, but one muted enough not to assault the eyes.

As for dress, I am quite comfortable in a suit and tie. I would probably do a simple blue or black theme consisting of a three-or-four button suit, dress shirt, tie, and pants to match the jacket. I would forgo the dress shoes, much like the past couple doctors have and replace them with comfortable slip-on shoes. I normally wear glasses now and would probably continue to do so, as it would feel weird to not have them. They would be rectangular in frame, though not very thick. and with corners much more rounded than what most people think when I say rectangular. black frames, simple and easy.

as for attitude, I would probably act like I do now, though with substantially much less stress. I would probably take on one of my best friends as a companion. I know exactly which one, as traveling alone is boring and dull. I would say adventurous and fun would be the style. nothing entirely too serious, ut what's life without a little danger here or there?

oh I almost forgot, I would probably use a slim pen-sized sonic. perhaps like ten's but with a darker blue or green theme and a darker silver body.",0,1317792777,null,0,false,0,c2ozp6p,t3_l1c3t,t1_c2ozp6p,t3_l1c3t,1427688585,3,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,3

My personal gripe is that I was in an accident about 4-5 years ago. Some one rear ended me. I was physically fine but the back of my car got duffed in quite a bit, so I claimed for the car damage against the other guys insurance, but saw no reason to get myself checked out or go anywhere near a whiplash claim.

About 1-2 years later I started to get 2-3 calls day from Indians in a call centre asking me if I wanted to claim for the accident long since passed, to which I said ' no thanks', however the 'No' meant nothing as the continued to call and still do to this day (I have a block on them. It's a feature on my phone, it gives them an engaged tone, so the cunts think we are home and keep trying to call!).

So forward a bit more in time and it transpires that the reason they were calling me was because my own fucking insurance company sold my details to them.

It then gets better, last year I was stupid enough to not renew before my insurance expired (by like half a day, so I did not drive uninsured). This meant they needed to re-run my quote and it came back twice as much, even though I have driven for over 20 years, never been in an accident caused by myself and have years and years of no claims. 

I asked why was the price hike so stupidly high, to which the women on the call said, 'There is nothing we can do about this, the whole industry has had to raise premiums due to people making injury claims from the injury claim industry which has become rampant over the past 2 years'.

So the moral of the story my insurance company sold my details without asking and then when the fallout came home to roast from their shitbag money grabbing ways, they turned round and charged me.

So basically from now on I won't be honest again with them. I won't break the law, but I will milk the cunts for every single penny I can get. I will fuck them over as much as possible and be a pain in the ass while I do it.",0,1317798405,null,0,true,0,c2p092k,t3_l0k04,t1_c2p092k,t1_c2oww3q,1427688910,4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,4

true,Tokei,tardis,TARDIS,"It depends on the local station and what else they were showing.  In some areas Doctor Who might have been the most expensive show, while in others it could have been fodder.  I grew up in a highly populated, nerd centric area so the local PBS station pretty much was the BBC.  But, in other areas, they couldn't afford it because it wasn't as popular and the cost to benefit ratio didn't balance out.  

I'm not exactly sure, but Doctor Who, the classic Doctor Who, shouldn't have been the most expensive show.  The classic Doctor Who was $10 in props and filmed in a quarry in Whales.  It wasn't an expensive show back in the day (the yarn for Tom Baker's scarf was probably the most expensive prop there, outside of the TARDIS), but it's more expensive now because of how popular it is.  With a higher demand the BBC can demand a higher price to air.  

But, honestly, Masterpiece Theater is probably much more expensive.  And before anyone comments about reusing the same props from production to production, please remember that, in the States, the new Sherlock Holmes was aired as a Masterpiece Theater run last year.  It's not all stuffy Victorian books.  Actually, go back and watch 'I, Claudius' and you'll see cheap sets with some damn good writing and acting.

""Given the relatively small geographical area and high population density of the UK, online DVD rentals have some differences from in the US, as a single shipping facility can serve the entire country. There are a large number of companies, but many are actually separately branded versions of the dominant company, LoveFilm, which provide the website, fulfilment and support services. In most cases the partner is a company with access to a large existing customer base (supermarket chains, newspapers, media companies, etc.) which it can direct to its branded site. Each brand may have slight differences in price, quantity, website features or ancillary benefits, but the actual DVD service will be from the same source.
In April 2006, LoveFilm merged with its major rival Video Island, which had operated ScreenSelect and other brands, and in February 2008, LoveFilm acquired Amazon's DVD rental business in the UK and German markets. In return, Amazon became the largest shareholder of LoveFilm. Remaining competitors include Blockbuster.""

I'd be Soph, short for Sophomore (which can actually mean something like 'wise fool', or if you're being snippy, 'educated idiot').  I'd be a lot younger and more naive than the Doctor, of course.

In fact, I'd probably be from some other universe where they're Temporal Adepts, not Time Lords, and the civilization as a whole is a lot younger and less settled. . . maybe someplace with a lower rate of entropy.  I'd be out traveling with my TATC (Traveler Across Temperospatial Continua . . the fact that it sounds a bit like 'taxi' is a mere coincidence I assure you) when something cataclysmic happens to Gallef and I'm thrown through the world walls and stuck in the Doctor's universe.

After the inevitable regeneration and restructuring as Tatsy and I adjust to the higher entropy, we'd be bumbling around trying to find any sign of the the Time Lords to help us cross back into our own universe.  We'd never find any, of course, but we'd meet all sorts of interesting people . . .

Tatsy would just be a paper-thin door stuck to a convenient wall, and she'd change styles to blend in with whatever doors are already there.  She'd be more of the brains of the outfit, too, being less powerful than the TARDIS but being able to talk to me and come up with ideas for us.

I'd be fairly gadget-oriented, since I wouldn't be that good at talking to people and thinking my way out of things.

. . . Um . . . so yeah, now you know how pathetic a fangirl I am XD

---edit

As for Tatsy's interior, there'd be a little salon to sit and eat sandwiches in just inside the front door; on the other side of the salon would be the doors into the control room, which would have hallways leading into the rest of the place (maybe a few bedrooms, a library, a kitchen . . about the size of a large house, but nowhere near mansion-sized).  Before the 'incident', Soph's favorite thing to do was go visit her friends and have tea with them in the front room while learning more about their culture.

Chelsea fans were pretty vocal/high-profile in their protest of higher ticket prices for Champions League games. The problem isn't that we don't have enough fans to fill the stadium, it's that the club does not make enough profit when the stadium is filled to capacity with regular ticket prices, and so has to charge more in order to compete with Arsenal, United, etc. and their gate revenues.

What the family/public doesn't know though is if Rudy Guede acted alone or there were more people involved, like Knox, Sollecito, or maybe others even.  Forensic evidence suggests that Guede had an accomplice/accomplices due to the fact that there weren't signs of a struggle, suggesting that Kercher was held down while she was raped by Guede, whose DNA btw was found inside Kercher and all over the room.  One of the issues with Guede's testimony and account of what happened is that he didn't implicate Knox or Sollecito until five months into the investigation, which is obviously pretty odd.

Basically, this entire case is an example of one gigantic clusterfuck, and it's unlikely we're ever going to know what really happened.  But, one of the things we do seem to know pretty clearly is that Rudy Guede raped and murdered Kercher (and stole money/phones).  Why/how do Knox and Sollecito become involved in that?  The prosecutor's case essentially was that (at least in regards to Knox) was that she was promiscuous and her, Sollecito, and Guede were basically Satanic cult sex worshipers, and when Kercher didn't want to engage in some sexual act with them, they killed her.  Pretty weak motivation argument.

true,Vitalstatistix,null,null,"In my opinion, yes I think Guede murdered Kercher.  I should back up and say that Guede only confessed to being in the apartment at the time of the murder.  His testimony stated that he was in the bathroom when he heard Knox and Kercher arguing (over lost money), then when he heard a scream, he ran out and saw an Italian man standing over Kercher's body and then he saw the man and Knox flee the scene out the window.  But some of the forensic evidence suggests that this version of events was impossible, and it doesn't account for two stolen cell phones that were found 10 minutes walk away.  And of course, there's Guede's DNA all over the room, the weapon, and Kercher, so I think he's guilty beyond reasonable doubt.

But while I don't think that Knox or Sollecito murdered Kercher, both have changed their statements/version of events of that night many times, which is obviously very suspicious.  Sollecito/Knox must have been doing *something* that night that they didn't want to divulge, but I don't think we'll ever really get the whole truth on the case, and even if we did, how would we know that it was the truth considering all the lies that have been told?

Well, I think she's probably the first child born on the TARDIS that we know of, and also, judging by his expression in AGMGW, the Doctor as well. Therefore, being the first being born on a TARDIS, a powerful manipulator of time and space and the Time Vortex, it's natural to think she was irradiated with all sorts of timey-wimey stuff that rubbed her DNA the wrong (or right) ways to make her special.

It was the end of her timestream. The proof is that if she was the TARDIS all along, she would have said something in TDW (*The Doctor's Wife*) when she had learned to speak properly.

The changes he is making is never going to get rid of the debt, in fact not even the deficit has gone down and we've started spending £2bn to provatise the NHS, another £1bn on Libya and £20bn plus bailing out europe with more to come. He has not succeeded in cutting spending, the deficit or debt. Does anyone really believe that americanising the NHS is going to better tackle the budget deficit than tackling tax evasion? It just can't. 

So you admit what he did was wrong, but then so many people knew that, told him and yet he did it anyway. The things i'm advocating won't be popular with people either, but more pertinently, they are people with money and power not us lowly proles who can only get kettled in the rain if we complain. Okay, so his cuts haven't worked, what now? 

I really don't do partisan politics, I believe it is just an illusion of choice of centrist parties all saying remarkably similar things. This is why the BNP have become popular because people like the tories have gone from strict caps on immigration to a free for all. 

The riots were and aren't as disgusting as illegal wars, torture, expense fiddling, pensioners dying from the cold, the PM peddling weapons to despots in the middle east, the scale of youth unemployment, the continued (labour started it) privatisation of the NHS, destroying peoples lives by locking them up for using drugs whilst he considers it ""normal"" for him to do it at uni. A few poor people kicking at the church of materialism isn't half as important as any of the above. Do you think the world has issues with a few people kicking at shops and not the millions of people dead and displaced on our imperialistic oil adventures? 

I think the system is corrupt, don't believe that MP's have the power to effect change in our cabinet system, they don't have power over half of the laws because they've been given to the EU and my MP is Margaret fucking Beckett, fuck. I think we have outgrown representation, we can all find the information and are often better informed than our drunk MPs, it would remove the ability of lobbyists and campaign donations.

I don't actually like democracy, majority oppressing the minority, but that's something else entirely.

Have you ever considered that maybe it's not about money for everyone, that some people genuinely don't want to be photographed and that they feel their right to privacy has been infringed?

Also if your dad is a successful photographer my bet is that he gets permission/consent from the subject of his work first. 

I can't believe your defense is other people do it so I can too. Two wrongs don't make a right.

But fair is fair.

I mean, you have to pay attention to the writer kinda.  Back when Moffat was just one of many we got Blink, girl in the fireplace, etc.  We also got the Library which was the only time I've liked River song.

Then he got the head writer gig and enough rope to hang himself.  He ruined the angels in time of the angels.  Ruined River song with how he took the arc, and a bunch of other things.  Then there's the endless paradoxes and how he uses em as a crutch.

It bothers me because that's the one unforgivable sin in fiction I think.  You are allowed to come up with whatever rules you like for your universe.  But once said rules are made, you have to stick to them. 

Take the lodger for example.

The Doctor, having got flung out of his TARDIS finds a note from himself in the future telling him exactly where to go to fix this problem.

Now in ""the pandorica opens"" I allow this kind of silliness because the universe did explode so the rules can be bent.  But he uses it everywhere in his stories.  The entire River Song arc is just one giant sample of it.

It's a shame because I really think his writing is holding me back from Liking Smith as much as he deserves.  Same for Amy and Rory.  I haven't been impressed With Karen Gillan much.  Amy is only OK in the grand scheme of companions to me.  But then we got the girl who waited, something Moffat didn't write.  And finally she had a chance to shine with some decent writing under her feet.

But then we go from that to something like The god complex.  Horrible, just horrible.

in particular

&gt;Cautions (including reprimands and warnings) are covered by the Rehabilitation of Offenders Act 1974 so will become spent immediately (apart from conditional cautions which will become spent after 3 months). This means that if you are asked on an application form if you have a caution you can reply 'no'. For conditional cautions it would be after 3 months since the caution was issued, up until that time you would have to reply 'yes'.
&gt;If the application form says that the post is exempt from the Rehabilitation of Offenders Act 1974 then the caution must be disclosed, no matter how long ago it was given.

&gt;However, this does not mean that it will not be disclosed on a CRB check. Under the current system all cautions, reprimands and final warnings are disclosed on both Standard and Enhanced CRB disclosures no matter how far back they go. If a caution / reprimand / warning is on record then it will be disclosed.

&gt;Cautions will always remain on a person's record. There are only exceptional circumstances when a caution could be removed from a person's record and it is anticipated that such incidents will be rare. Examples of such possible circumstances are that it was found that the original arrest or sample was unlawful or where it was found beyond all doubt that no offence existed. Any requests that fit the above criteria should be directed to the Chief Constable of the force concerned.

**Found it:**

In the final days of the War, the Eighth Doctor attempted to regain the Great Key, which had been stolen by unknown forces. After being imprisoned for a month, with the help of Chantir he was able overpower the guards and escape with the key. With the key, he believed that the De-mat Gun could be replicated and the Medusa Cascade closed. The Doctor planned to modify the gun so that instead of it removing an individual from time and space, it would remove millions from time and space. (IDW: The Forgotten) This modified De-Mat Gun later became the Moment, the device that would destroy Gallifrey. (DW: The End of Time, IDW: Don't Step on the Grass) The Doctor destroyed Gallifrey because Lord President Rassilon planned to destroy time so that the Time Lords could become non-corporeal beings, existing without time. (DW: The End of Time) With the exception of a relative few survivors, both the Time Lords and the Daleks disappeared from time and space. (DW: Dalek, The Parting of the Ways, Army of Ghosts/Doomsday)

**On Regeneration:**

The exact circumstances behind the Doctor's eighth regeneration are unknown. However, the Doctor's tenth incarnation revealed that he had been alone when he died.

The Silence is an order trying to kill the Doctor, because he is the only one who can save the universe from them.

Then, in a moment of triumph, when the baddies believe the Doctor is dead, they'll laugh and say, ""Doctor who!""

I'm very excited about him possibly being the Other.  If true, it lays to rest a thousand questions posed over both the original and the new series, even sofar as the meta question of ""what's so special about this time lord that he seems to be able to live through just about anything AND kill all the other ones?""

Also, from wikipedia (for what its worth):

*Cartmel felt that years of explanations about the Doctor's origins and the Time Lords had removed much of the mystery and strength of the character of the Doctor, and decided to make the Doctor ""once again more than a mere chump of a Time Lord"".[1] Elements of this effort were liberally scattered through Seasons 25 and 26 of the series, and occasionally included hints about the Doctor's past; for example, in Silver Nemesis, when Ace and the Doctor discuss the creation of validium, the Doctor mentions that it was created by Omega and Rassilon. Ace asks, ""And...?"" and the Doctor is silent. Cartmel has written that this was meant to indicate that the Doctor was ""more than a Time Lord"":*

*...Omega and Rassilon were the founding fathers of Gallifrey. They towered above the Time Lords who followed. They were demigods. And Ace's nifty dialogue ""And..."" coupled with the Doctor's neatly evasive response, are a subtle attempt to say that there was a third presence there in the shadowy days of Gallifrey's creation. In other words, the Doctor was also there. So he's more than a Time Lord. He's one of these half-glimpsed demigods.*",0,1317838241,null,0,false,0,c2p43ax,t3_l1gcy,t1_c2p43ax,t1_c2p15zq,1427690720,5,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,5

but i actually really do not like Karen Gillan as a companion. i feel most of the time she was recruited to be eye candy. and in some ways she is an exceptional companion i guess, maybe it is just Amy that i do not like, i think craig would be an awesome companion! :D. Rory is an amazing character though. i hate him for my own stupid reasons, (my ex left me cuz she was in love with some kid named Rory, so everytime they say his name a small sliver of my obsessive mind frame makes my eye twitch.) 

if i had to talk about companions i guess i would have to categorize it into different labels of companions. what i mean is, I like Billie Piper as a companion. but i do not like her character Rose. or, i like martha's character but i do not like the actress at all. and Donna is pretty chill all around. im confusing :/

i like smith. it is fresh to see the way he potrays the doctor in some sense. its nice to see the doctor ""full of heart"" and compassionate, if that makes sense.. :/

First, in the library, River appears to be out of prison.  If she is out of prison, it is assumed that she has been pardoned, what if it is because the doctor has revealed that he is not dead, and she did not commit the crime?

Also, River knows the Doctor's name in SITL.  It appears that the doctor did not tell her his name when they were married.  IF ""the question"" is Doctor Who? and the answer is his name, then, when Silence fell, his name would have been revealed, and River would have known it to tell the Doctor in the library.

Finally, River says ""younger than I have ever seen you.""  This is obvious because it was the 10th doctor, but ""than I've ever seen you"" makes one think that she has seen several iterations of the Doctor-- possibly his regeneration after the ""fall of the 11th?""

12 will settle in after everything is solved only to realize that in River timestream she is really close to her death. He will then want to take her to a last date and show up for her with ""a new suit and hair"". 

So not to leave her hanging he will willfully tell her his name and Silence (in the library) will fall.


The last thing about this theory is 10th shock about how there's only one time that a person can know his name. 

Well... maybe this time is where the doctor know that this person is going to die and will not pass it forward, and he is shocked by the whole situation, and keep on trying to keep her alive. Which he ""fails"" as she sacrifices herself to him.

Yes of course I acknowledge that everyone else does it on the internet, *that doesn't make it right*. How old are you? that's the sort of argument you get from a child.

Then your father doesn't shoot individuals as the subjects and is therefore irrelevant in this discussion.

Yes I'm aware there is a lot of CCTV in the UK, no I don't sue because being photographed in public isn't illegal, I'm not talking about legality I'm talking about ethics (which is a foreign concept to the government and seemingly some photographers).

Google maps/streetview doesn't make individuals the subject, **they also attempt to blur the face of individuals caught on camera due to ethics**.

I can accept that you're comfortable being photographed without permission by strangers but why can't you accept that not everyone is (I'd even say most people aren't) which is why *permission is important*.

Why Utah? Why the lake? Why was the Doctor there in the FIRST place? There was NO reason for him to be at that lake. The only reason for him to be there was to die.... So what was the plan? They put River in a lake and HOPE he arrives? They put a LOT of hope into an ontological paradox.

Also, if the Doctor had a Tesalecta ship/suit - won't THEY know he's still alive? Don't they keep records? 

And why would River be arrested? It was the suit, not her. It didn't even have to be HER in the suit.

Also - since time froze at 5:02, April 22nd, 2011.... and after it was unstuck people remembered... then the Amy at 5:02 should have remembered everything when she was unstuck. If she remembered the wedding, she should have remembered that River was her daughter and that meant that she was pregnant and that really throws a wrench/paradox into the whole rest of the season....

Okay, pretending there's actual science behind this show (there doesn't seem to be any at the moment) a fixed point in time could mean an event that directly or indirectly leads to the future invention of time travel by the Timelords.  Therefore changing one of these events would prevent the time traveler from going back in time and changing it in the first place.

So how was the Doctor able to save Adelaide Brooke in Waters of Mars?  The point from which the Doctor originally arrived from in the 2005 series has been locked, it exists in an infinite loop outside of time and space and can't be altered.  The invention of time travel will have always occurred (edit: for the Doctor only, and maybe some Daleks) as long as the lock is in place, making the Doctor the ""Timelord Victorious"".

That does not mean he didn't damage time or create an alternate reality, Adelaide Brooke was inspired to become an astronaut by the Dalek invasion in 2008.  In the Moffat series Amy has no memory of the Daleks.  If the Daleks never invaded Captain Brooke would never have gone to Mars and the fixed point would never have happened.  The whole Moffat run may be taking place in a disintegrating alternate timeline. (If so then did End of Time actually happen?  Yep, time lock.)  This is also a clever way of leaving the door open for a Tennant movie or something, I kinda suspect that was the whole reason the ""Timelord Victorious"" scene was written.

But then why did it break time when River created a paradox?  ""Fuck you, that's why"" is probably a good explanation.

It didn't leave me feeling like I was bouncing off the walls like earlier finales. It felt like all the wow-factor was spent on The Pandorica Opens.

I've only watched The Wedding of River Song once so far, so I haven't had a chance to go back again and pick through it again, but it felt rushed and packed with too much shit going on, for starters. Pretty much everyone had guessed beforehand that the Doctor was going to get out of his death using either the ganger or the tesselecta, so finding out that oh, yeah, we were right wasn't much of a payoff. I'm also kind of annoyed that yet another alternate timeline was created and destroyed, just like in The Big Bang. 

I know it seems that most people here prefer Moffat over Davies, but Davies did some things way better. Like s3 - the whole thing with the pocketwatch being the key to the Master coming back.

Pretty much this:

Now we have the question: what about the 10th Doctor, wouldn't he remember the bubble universe? Not necessarily, perhaps the only ones that remember the bubble universe are those who are part of the fix point. If that is the case then only Adelaide Brooke would remember and this would explain why the Doctor, Amy, Rory and River remember as well but not anyone else. Finally, this I think puts an interesting spin on the hatred Adelaide shows the Doctor before she killed herself at the end of the Waters of Mars and a more full explanation as to why she understands what the 10th Doctor did was so wrong.

true,LokianEule,mccoy,Time's Champion,"Vastra is a Silurian warrior who shares a house with a human woman, Jenny, in Victorian London, with whom she shares an intimate relationship.

She is one of many people who owed the Doctor a debt: she had awoken during the construction of part of the London Underground and had wanted to take revenge on innocent tunnel workers for the deaths of her ""sisters""; the Doctor convinced her not to give in to rage. Vastra instead made a home in London, disguising her Silurian form to most people and acting as a freelance adventuress.

After eating Jack the Ripper, she was summoned by the Doctor to help in the mission to rescue Amy Pond and her baby at Demons Run. She and Jenny arrived at Demons Run along with an army of Silurian soldiers. They both survived the battle with the Headless monks. It was implied she had known the Doctor for some time as she referred to him as an old friend.

true,TLKv3,null,null,"lol. I love how you insinuate I know nothing of writing even though it's actually what I'm planning on getting into when I get back to my school life.

For one thing, River Song is nothing more than a blatant child-like fan creation come to life. Moffat's been watching this show for years, in fact, Google his Google Posts from 1995/1996. He's always had the idea of River Song in his head before he was even a part of the Who writing team. She's nothing more than Moffat's dream woman come to life. Not to mention his ""relationship writing"" is dreadfully painful and generic. The only interesting thing about it was ""Spoilers! You'll find out soon!"" And it ended up being exactly what everyone thought. How is that creative in any way? Writing the most obvious answer as the be-all end-all resolution? There's nothing genius or creative about it. It's lazy.

And for the record, it was never stated in the show that The Silence were responsible for hijacking the TARDIS and blowing it up. And if they were, don't you think they would have just repeated that except with The Doctor inside after the universe ""rebooted""? He didn't/couldn't stop it the first time, why wouldn't they just do it again? It's the most illogical plot hole in the entire Series.

As far as ""memorable"" characters from RTD's run, how about: Madame de Pompadour? Wilfred? Sally Sparrow? How about The Fortune Teller from 'Turn Left', and what her purpose was for? Lady Christina de Souza? Plenty of old faces who could have stood to be revisited at a different point in their lives to encounter the Eleventh and his new personality.

When I say a mystery can only go on for so long, I mean he needs to learn how to pace/time his executions off. He's been far more interested in getting across ""HEY EVERYONE WATCHING, THIS IS RIVER SONG, SHE'S MY CHARACTER AND I'VE MADE HER AS IMPORTANT AS THE DOCTOR IS BECAUSE SHE'S MINE, DO YOU SEE HER? RIGHT HERE. SHE'S RIGHT HERE, LOOK AT HER!"" And if you haven't noticed, the only mysteries he HAS bothered to solve have only been the Series-wide arc: The cracks, the death. None of the smaller questions that he's brought up have been resolved that could use addressing sooner rather than later, instead of brushing them under the rug and whispering ""couldn't figure out a way to write out of those... so we'll pretend they never happened, kay?""

Then when she touched her younger self it violates the fact that the same object cannot occupy the same point in time and space. Since time has already been weakened it is enough for the reapers to tear through and commence cleanup. I believe it was explained as such in the episode, been awhile.

Time can be rewritten is the idea that is being explored currently. Pompeii can be considered a fixed point because by not causing the eruption it would greatly alter time. The Doctor has a choice to save Pompeii or preserve the future of humanity. I think *Waters of Mars* somewhat follows the same line. It was an important launching point to the human race's spread into the rest of the Universe. The Doctor at that point felt he could save the woman and alter time, but it is very possible that it would have had a significant impact on the future of the human race. If I am not mistaken the reason the woman committed suicide was largely due to the fact that the Doctor had explained her significance to the future.

If a fixed point were interfered with, all of time would become stuck and the universe would die.

I'm going to give you some help. I will help you with a skill that is necessary not only for your soon-to-start career as a student, but your future career as a writer. That skill is the basic skill of writing an essay.

Here's the big think you're missing, sir. You like to talk about things, and make all sorts of claims, but you never give any examples. No evidence, no examples, nothing.  Let's start with the mysteries. You state that there are a myriad of little mysteries that are left unanswered. So, what are they? I provided a multitude of mysteries that were most definitely answered. You provided none, but insisted that there were some.

Next is with River Song. Shouting in caps lock does not prove your point. You can say that he is obsessed with River Song, but you never provide why this is supposedly so factual.  From my perspective, this could be said about a lot of characters, even under RTD.  Rose and Donna were both characters that RTD made super important. Rose was made important to Doctor, even to the point in which he would obsess over her for no particular reason. I think Donna is fairly obvious, and I shouldn't have to explain.

Also, if you're going to point out characters that were important under RTD, you might want to double check to make sure you're not pointing out Moffat characters. That's not the point, though.

true,busstopboxer,null,null,"So you plan to only ever play one out of Modric and VdV? That sounds pretty stupid.

There is nothing inherently wrong with playing VdV wide - no he's not the most effective when it comes to tracking back, but he's better than people are giving him credit for off the back of the weekend's game. And what he does offer is a lot of space for the full-back behind him to run into. You think Walker has such a good game if there's a winger in his way all the time? I'm sure he'll still do well behind Lennon, but VdV made a lot of space for him on Sunday.

The real problem was that we needed a centre midfield capable of making up for his failings at RM, so we should have been playing Sandro and Parker in the middle. He's well covered then and can go on and influence the game more.

Now this leaves us with no central spot for Modric, unless you push him forward to play off Adebayor. I'm sure he'd do so very well - plays this more advanced role for Croatia I think - but rather than this I'd switch him and VdV, so Modric goes right, Vdv plays off the forward. Like we played at Wigan. But my point is that in the case that Modric or others are unavailable, VdV playing right side is not inherently a problem.

Assume Lennon is fit soon and we don't play VdV on the right. Bale plays the left, Adebayor up front. Against a team who is going to sit back and let us have the ball at WHL do you really think we need two central enforcers? No we don't. Yeah, playing Sandro and Parker together will sometimes be effective, particularly against stronger, more technically proficient teams, but half the teams we play don't fit that category. And in those cases we'll miss the central trickery that VdV and Modric together can offer in breaking down a stubborn defence. VdV drops deep off the front anyway, so we wouldn't necessarily be outnumbered in the middle. There's definitley a place for both of those players in our team at the same time.

You seem to think that a 433 is the answer to our problems (though what you've drawn looks closer to the defensive 451 of Bolton's Allardyce years), but one of our greatest assets over the last couple of years has been width that other teams just don't know how to deal with. I'd be reluctant to give that up. If we keep the wingers wide with your formation Adebayor is going to be a bit stranded upfront, unless the most advanced central plays moves closer to him, in which case that's pretty much just our current first choice wide 4231 formation anyway.

I do think we should have a 433 in our armoury - not something we necessarily use every week, but an option for against tougher opponents - but I think it's important that if we do Bale pushes back to the left wing-back position so we don't lose that width, and the ""wingers"" play a narrower game to support the striker more directly.

I think we maybe need to not get hung up on the idea of needing to dramatically change our game to improve on last years performances. Last season saw lots of very good play from us, and lots of chances created. That shows the system works - no need to scramble around to change it. We already have what we need to make a difference: one new top striker, and one rejuventated top striker, to put those chances away.

And those women are not as strong as Donna, Harriet Jones, Martha, Rose, and all the many, accomplished in-charge women RTD wrote. These women had more character traits than flirty dialogue and were more than conversation-vehicles for the men.

River is a terribly written character. She's cool and all but completely two dimensional (and again, I say that liking Alex Kingston). Rewatch the RTD seasons. The female characters dialogue and responses to the Doctor are so much more varied than just kinky dialogue or catchphrases.

I mean, in the first episode of Amy, she prays for help, gets the Doctor and falls victim to Prisoner Zero.

In Rose's first episode? She smashes the fire alarm and yells for everyone to evacuate. She tries to get the Doctor out of the Tardis and behind a metal fence, she (under no one's instructions) thinks to grab a chain and kick the poison into the alien. SHE saves the Doctor. Then, her boyfriend clinging to her, she calls her mom to see if she's okay. Refuses to come with the Doctor at first because she had a boyfriend. Then she realizes he doesn't appreciate her so she's rather have dangerous adventures off in the universe.

Let me make one thing clear: I am NOT bashing River Song, believe it or not. I am on the verge of hating her, but I'm making a conscious effort not to because I KNOW she can be a good, exciting character. It's just that Moffat is trying with every means available to him, to FORCE the audience to like her. And when people do that with characters they've created, it just sets off alarm bells for ""Mary Sue Author's Pet"". 

I don't know about you lot, but I have this innate brain-gag reflex, so to speak, that not only forbids me from liking such a character, but more often than not makes me loathe her from the bottom of my soul.

Pardon my geek out, but I particularly love the choice of ""fixed point"" because my brain immediately interpreted it as a ""[fixed point function](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixed_point_(mathematics)),"" but rather than acting on numbers, it acts on causality. It's not that you can't _try_ to create a paradox; it's that every way you could try to create a paradox would just resolve the paradox. It's like an extension to ""[restricted action resolution](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grandfather_paradox#Restricted_action_resolution),"" to _permit_ paradoxes but still achieve consistency anyway. 

The clever bit about the Silence is they noticed that faced with a fixed point, the Doctor just plain _gives up_. Not once, but time and time again!

Of course, now the Doctor has wriggled his way out of a fixed point^*, the Doctor now has one less fear. Oops. :-)

_\* - The true fixed point was the apparent death of the Doctor. The Silence assured that -- by using something so terrifying, the Doctor would need to go into hiding, leading them to believe they had successfully defeated him. They cemented the fixed point by watching the assasination succeed. I'm certain that Silence that observed the assasination was from the past (in the assasination plot timeline). When River says ""of course"", she has to realized that if she succeeded, the Silence observer would simply report back the assasination failure and tweak the parameters a bit, ensuring her missed shot, or deflecting it, or absorbing it but surviving, etc. ..._

So yeah, I'm seriously geeking out on mathematics &lt;=&gt; plot postulations right now. Thanks for bearing with me through it.

Edit-add: case in point, the death of [Adelaide Brooke](http://tardis.wikia.com/wiki/Adelaide_Brooke). A paradox occurred, but again resolved itself with her death. Time unfolded almost without change. (Perhaps the various alternate realities all cycle in on each other like a gordian knot? The Doctor, observing the suicide, doesn't interfere further? Or that she chooses to disappear, perhaps hitching a ride with a different time traveller to the year 50,000 for amusement sake. The essential fixed quantities seem to be (a) the record of her death, (b) her essential non-presence in that local time stream, and (c) the Doctor's resignation to fate) ",0,1317885754,null,0,true,0,c2patmd,t3_kxebb,t1_c2patmd,t1_c2oar0n,1427693967,1,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,1

Also as friendlyhumanist explained how when the Weeping Angels are being looked at they don't really exist, so the Silent would have no control on it at all.

In another country it is a way of telling other people where you're from and looking for something that you might have in common with others.

At a sporting event it is a way of encouraging your team, telling others who you're supporting and associating with other fans of the same team.

In your own country it is either:

 - A way of telling others that you supprt the royal family
 - A way of telling others that you are anti the EU.
 - A subtle way of telling others that you vote BNP.
 - A way of telling others that you think your national heritage is superior.
 - That you are protestant or support the Union (in Ireland)

I don't attach racist connotations to the flags either. St Georges Cross is the flag of England, and it will remain that.

There's plenty of hooliganism in football, but people still openly support teams that are infamous for it, so I'm not convinced by argument A.

Your argument B perhaps has some ground in some communities though. I don't personally know anyone who expresses things in that manner, but that doesn't invalidate the possibility.

Also, if you don't manage to get tickets initially, keep an eye out on the Wednesday a few days before the game as that is when there is a resale on tickets that have been declined by season ticket holders and any others that may come available.

This point is quite a big issue with me at the moment because my Canadian fiancé is over at the moment, and planning to move to England shortly. It pisses me off so much when so many of my friends say to her ""why are you moving here, it is shit. You should both go to Canada"". It annoys me most because I know they don't actually think that, and if they did think it is most likely out of ignorance. Anyone I actually call on this point ends up realising that we do live in a good country.


It seems to be a very British trait to play down your opinions of things. If someone scores a volley from the half way line, most people might say ""that was decent"", instead of ""whooping"" and lifting the person over their head. Although I like this trait, it is a shame that it stretches to the opinion of the country. 


I have been told a few times while I have been abroad that they were shocked that I liked England, as I was the first English person not to say it was shit. This then gives them the opinion that England is a bad country, which they may spread around.

Lower interest rates encourage people to spend, not save. But when interest rates can go no lower, a central bank's only option is to pump money into the economy directly. That is quantitative easing (QE).

The way the central bank does this is by buying assets - usually financial assets such as government and corporate bonds - using money it has simply created out of thin air.

The institutions selling those assets (either commercial banks or other financial businesses such as insurance companies) will then have ""new"" money in their accounts, which then boosts the money supply.

No one ever says this about Greater London or Greater Manchester, although the meaning there is the same. Greater London means ""Bigger London"" as opposed to the City of London. Similarly, ""Great Britain"" means ""large"" Britain (the British island), as opposed to [""Little Britain"", better known as Brittany](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brittany).

a. Anyone who tells the truth always is a sociopath. Lies grease the wheels of society. 'It was nice meeting you' 'No, you don't look fat'

b. What does 'finding yourself' actually mean? Maybe you should try a mirror?

c. What one should do when something scares you, catches you or growls at you, really depends upon what 'it' is. If 'it' is a bear, please do NOT follow your own advice.

d. One should use ones own judgement on whether or not to joke about 'serious' things. Sometimes a joke is all that is needed to make something seem less serious and easier to deal with. It can be a kindness.

e. The rules of the universe are Man's undersanding of how the universe works. If the exceptions outweigh the rules, the rules need to be re-examined and improved upon.

f. Our time maybe finite, but how does one respect it's limits and why should one? If you mean 'don't waste time', just say that. Just remember your time is your own, you decide what is a waste of your time or if you wish to waste it. You have every right to waste your own time.

Every human child should be taught to think for themselves and that rules can be used for ill and for good. Disobedience is a virtue.

Having said that, this is the same arguments that the BNP will use - why should the taxes that the rest of Britain create be spent on people who haven't done their share?  They use the flag to symbolise their passion for this.

To be honest, I don't think it isn't that people aren't proud to be British and don't have symbols for it, it is that the symbol of the flag has been picked up elsewhere be bigots and people don't want to be associated with bigots, so they use other symbols instead.",0,1317906238,null,0,false,0,c2pby7b,t3_l2uh5,t1_c2pby7b,t1_c2pbngc,1427694496,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

I don't recall OP saying it was racist. All OP said was such decoration be expected on a BNP page. This is because the BNP etc. are the sort of group who like to wave a flag as though it was a weapon. The British people do not generally fly flags and what not. We don't *do* that sort of thing, outside the Proms etc. My unease at seeing St George's cross around the place extends even to this subreddit. I see it as flair next to people's name and it gives me a wibble.

All due to various nasty groups using the flags to their own ends.

&gt; if anyone in England see's a flag they deem it as being an attack on English people with dual nationalities.

I'm English and I don't think that. It entirely depends on the context, as I outlined further up. If I see it on a castle or on a council house then that's fine. If I see it on a little flag sticking out of a car... no: BNP. Same with the St George's cross - wrapped around someone in the street (usually witout a shirt on) then I think EDL/Football violence.

The reason for that is... We're *in* England, we're *in* Britain. Some have never left. Similarly to the Americans who chant ""USA! USA!"" at various rallies or sports games: Who are they *talking* to? Who is a chap who hangs a St George's cross out of his window *showing* it to?

However, the real reason I'm posting is just to say I've been downvoted too many times on Reddit for saying I proudly have the Welsh flag up in my bedroom. Some people get upset by things because they are told to be upset by them. There's nothing you can do to change that.

Anyone who gets upset by the sight of the flag of the country they have moved to is clearly in the wrong country. Thankfully, I don't think these people actually exist. It's an idea contrived from some bizarre notion that our culturally different friends have moved to a country that  offends them for having its own culture, history and pride. Why anyone would think people feel like this is beyond me. I wouldn't move to any country and then feel like I was being excluded because people like their own country.

Flags have been used by overt nationalists and racists, but that doesn't mean the rest of us are banned from appreciating our country. Look at the USA, they have their foul racists draped in the stars and stripes at times, yet the vast majority of the population still proudly display it.

And before I hear the argument as I have on previous occasions, national pride does not mean you are trying to claim credit for things other people in your country have done.

When it is flying or displayed in certain places then I associate it with narrow mindedness, people who are quick to anger, ignorance and probably discriminatory views. What can I say... I'm prejudiced I suppose.

But seeing it in the 'correct' location: a castle, on parliament - it's fine!

However:
&gt; we are told we cannot put up the flag

&gt; we have actually bought into the idea that an English Flag will offend someone else

Fuck that. Both of those, as far as I'm concerned, are bullshit. By that I mean both the rules and the hype. The ""in case it offends someone"" is rubbish and there are very few people who think this or make rulings because of it. Consider my old Uni: they decided that, iirc, UK national flags were not allowed to be displayed in the windows of student halls. 
They said it was because it made the place look untidy - that was their reasoning. Unfortunately I don't recall how it was resolved, but I remember that there was backlash because other nationalities were displaying their flags apparently without any bother.

However when something like that pops up, you'll get the Daily Heil or the Express bitching about it on the front cover saying ""British people told not to be British!"" or some other such bollocks even if that is not the case. As with my example, it was possible that it was only halls in certain area that were ""on show"" where students were asked to remove flags - the international students in another area were fine. But, like all ""PC GONE MAD!"" stories, it's mainly bullshit on the part of the papers.

Similarly the ""Offend"" argument/idea: Consider rules coming around saying ""You can't send Christmas cards in case you offend 'the Muslims' etc."". Utter drivel: 'The Muslims' *do not care* that people have Christmas and didn't make a fuss in the first place. If 'a Muslim' does, then said 'Muslim' is in a tiny, tiny minority. Usually the ""rules"" stem from a worried over zealous twonk trying to justify their HR job and doing a brainstorm. Then the papers pick up on it and spin the shit like they did with [Winterval](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winterval#Legacy) - Certain groups and papers like to say that ""Birmingham banned Christmas and replaced it"". This bullshit has been debunked *time and again* but every year or so the same bitchy papers pick up the crap, dust it off and decide it's time to cause trouble again.

&gt;In England all the boasting and flag-wagging, the ‘Rule Britannia’ stuff, is done by small minorities. The patriotism of the common people is not vocal or even conscious. They do not retain among their historical memories the name of a single military victory. English literature, like other literatures, is full of battle-poems, but it is worth noticing that the ones that have won for themselves a kind of popularity are always a tale of disasters and retreats. There is no popular poem about Trafalgar or Waterloo, for instance. Sir John Moore's army at Corunna, fighting a desperate rearguard action before escaping overseas (just like Dunkirk!) has more appeal than a brilliant victory. The most stirring battle-poem in English is about a brigade of cavalry which charged in the wrong direction. And of the last war, the four names which have really engraved themselves on the popular memory are Mons, Ypres, Gallipoli and Passchendaele, every time a disaster.

Taking a car down to The Gambia, selling it to raise funds for a premature baby unit type thing and coming home. In the end, due to timing and University, we ended up buying a car and driving to Morocco and back as a holiday. As such I can't help with regards to raising money and what it's like travelling with groups.

I can offer some advice on Morocco though, though I imagine you'll get lots of info from people who've been before? Humour me. Here's a couple of things you might find useful to know about in advance.

* If you're stopping by The Rock: Don't plan on buying anything in Gibralter unless you're a millionaire.
* Honking - It's done as a matter of course in Morocco, and probably other countries around the area. Light turns green: People honk 2 nano seconds later. Feck knows why, they just do. Honking indicates pretty much anything it seems.
* Admission papers - We went from Algericas to Tangier and had to fill out forms on the ferry. No-one was particularly helpful and we weren't sure what we were supposed to be doing, but we eventually got it sorted. Before customs etc. in the port a guy came round offering to help fill out our forms and point us the right way. Turned out we already had the right ones sorted, but this guy was an 'official tout', as it were. We didn't need him, but the authorities allowed him to wander around taking money off tourists for pretty much no reason.
* When we were pretty much sorted waiting to go through the last checkpoint, a policeman/border guard was wandering around. He stopped by our passenger door (driver door over there) and stood close to our wingmirror. When he left I got out to have a check and found a big yellow chalk ""X"" on the front of the mirror casing. I rubbed it off. Feck knows who would have stopped us for whatever reason if we'd left it on there. - Moral of that story: Keep an eye on your motor!
* There will generally be someone who will look after your car while you're away overnight for what amounts to a few pence. This can be on a street or in carpark. Sometimes hotels provide them, sometimes a guy looks after a stretch of road. One night a mate was on the balcony looking down into the street and noticed someone come up and try one of the doors on our car. The watchman ran over and started beating him with his stick. Vigilant guys.

Frayed knot.

There was a tv show on a few years back called ""How British Do You Think You Are?"" (or somesuch), that interviewed several nationalists ranging from the lunatic eccentric to the 'foaming at the mouth-dont get me started about the muslims' Essex boy type.

The 2 questions they posed were:

1. How many generations back do you have to go to be truly British?

2. How British do you thing you are?

They then took DNA swabs from all of them and re-interviewed when they had the results.

The foaming at the mouth guy had said that Ian Wright had no grounds to calling himself British as he was the child of immigrants. In answer to the first question in respect to this, he said about 5 - 7 generations to be Truly British.

His results showed that he had Eastern European genetic makeup that went back no more than 4 generations.

I'll have to find some online info for the programme as it wasnt that great but good to see some ignorant fools get their dumb ideology handed to them.

Very little music was actually original in this season/series.  Just one more weak point of this season IMO.  Season 5 was far far better.  I hope Moffat can redeem himself in Season 7. 

Edit:  Also, one more thought.  It is not that surprising that they simply pulled the music from Season 5.  Look how many tracks there are (i'll save you the trouble, 65).  My problem with it is that the use of them was very predictable and the sound/music editing was simply atrocious.  It had not been composed for the scenes it was used in, simply reused by the editors so it doesn't exactly fit.

Of course music was reused under Davies' time as showrunner.  It was not played up nearly as much as it has been this time around.  However the point was not to compare the music use to Davies' seasons so much as Moffat's previous 5th season which did it very well and was far better than Season 6.

Edit: Not to mention that Moffat would also have some control/sway over who is getting hired for those positions.  Everyone is a slave to execs to some extent but he sure has more power than any other creative element in the show (i.e. not business/$$ making side of it).

Out of the 9th and 10th Doctor's companions I think I like Donna best. Rose was boring and had no character growth, and Martha's infatuation with the Doctor annoyed me. Both of them had redeeming qualities, but Donna wins out because she had the most satisfying character development (starts out an annoying, mouthy temp who's loud mouthed to hide her lack of confidence and self-esteem and ends up the most important woman in the galaxy and saves the world) and heart-breaking ending.

I find Amy hard to judge as a character. I loved her in Series 5 - she has fantastic chemistry with the 11th Doctor and I enjoyed her development from naive little girl who's infatuated with the Doctor to a more mature adult who realises Rory is her true love.

She was confident, but always humble ""I'm a temp."" never making herself out to be anything she wasn't. She also showed true selflessness. She cared about her gramps Wilfred more than anything else, and always wanted to make sure he was happy.

as for systems.
Time can be in two/three states.

1- It can be in 'flux'. this means that you can change what happens. this may result in the end of the world, but could also result in the saving of the world. also, paradoxes happen but you should try and avoid them. they get a bit messy.

2 - Certain points in time are 'fixed'. this means that what happens at that point, must ALWAYS happen. say, for example the destruction of Pompeii. It is inevitable and nothing you can do will change it. However, you may unbeknownestly be the actual cause of the event in the first place, but thats a bit complicated.

3 - only really applies to rare occurances. this is when events are 'time-locked'. not sure if you've got to it yet, but the time war between the Timelords and the Daleks is time-locked, meaning it is impossible to contact/alter/enter anything/one that is there. it is essentially sealed off to the rest of the universe.

I think that there should have been punishment handed down to Donnachie (and I agree with you that he doesn't see his actions as offensive but not expelled).

Martha...

A) cared far more about macking on the Doctor than adventuring in time and space.  She would actively mope when he inadvertently friend-zoned her even when surrounded by all sorts of awesome things.

B) whined about Rose far too much.  People remember her reacting to the Doctor whining about Rose, but really he only does this once in the Shakespeare episode.  She doesn't do it *constantly* but her pouting when the Doctor is telling Jack that *someone he cares about is not actually dead* has always pissed me off.

Sure she became a good soldier and all that, but a lot of it falls into the problem of ""show, don't tell"" writing.  RTD *told* us through Tom Milligan that Martha Jones was a legend and a total badass, we never really saw it.  Even her cameos in Season 4 don't quite let her live up to her supposed reputation, though they come much closer.

David Tennant is a fantastic doctor, and Matt Smith after him is also just as good, though in a different way.

While I think the writing improves over time, you aren't going to see the campiness go away. The original series was incredibly campy, and I think it's just a part of the show. Not all episodes are like that, there are some very dramatic and emotional moments, but don't expect the silliness to go away entirely. So if that bothers you, then you might want to give it up. I guess I'd say if you have the time then give the second season a shot, then decide. 

If you continue, I think you should go in order.

In fact:

&gt; The readthrough script for Episode 1 had minimal changes before issue as a shooting script. The main alteration was the ultimately deleted scene at Stormcage where the governor remonstrated with River Song over her previous 15 escapes under his predecessor, ""Oh, it was never fifteen -- unless you're counting holidays and hair appointments..."" said River as she opened a cupboard on the cell wall and pulled out an impossibly long clothes rail of dresses commenting, ""Don't mind my wardrobe. Teensy bit bigger on the inside!"" There were more changes later made to Episode 2; the opening sequence with Rory and Canton was set in Chicago's waterfront docklands and the final scene with the little girl was set in New York. The Doctor and his friends had been gathering information over two rather than three months between installments. Still to be added were the Doctor's comparisons of the Silents to the Roman Empire, the Doctor describing the sensation of the Silents being around, and much of a sub-plot about the Doctor's beard.

true,PhoBWanKenobi,mcgann,McGann,"I posted that, and am about halfway through my rewatch and ran into some problems: 

The early order is pretty easy:

* A Good Man Goes to War (born)
* The Impossible Astronaut (childhood - raised by the Silence, shot at by her mother)	
* Day of the Moon (childhood, first regeneration)
* Let's Kill Hitler (adolescence/meets the Doctor/enrolls in Luna University)
* Closing Time (Becomes Doctor Song, is taken again by Kovarian)
* The Wedding of River Song   (Marries the Doctor/kills the Teselecta)

After that, it gets rougher to figure out. This is the official order from the Confidential vid:

* Ice Skating on the Thames (A Good Man Goes to War)
* Reveals her identity to the Doctor and the Ponds (A Good Man Goes to War)
* Witnesses the Doctor’s death (The Impossible Astronaut/Day of the Moon)
* Leaves a message for the Doctor at the beginning of time (The Pandorica Opens)
* Speaks to the Doctor about her identity at Amy and Rory’s wedding (The Big Bang)
* The crash of the Byzantium (Time of Angels/Flesh and Stone)
* Visits her parents and tells them the Doctor is alive (The Wedding of River Song)
* Death (Silence in the Library/Forest of the Dead)

But contextual clues from the episodes suggest a different order (I rambled about this in my [blog](http://www.phoebenorth.com/2011/10/06/river-song-rewatch-report-2-is-the-official-timeline-accurate/), hoping someone would weigh in, but no dice. Then again, I'm being a ridic nerd anyway so I'm not surprised!) Like this, or something close to it:

* ? Ice skating on the Thames (A Good Man Goes to War) - This scene is pretty much impossible to place chronologically with the info we have
* Leaves a message for the Doctor at the beginning of time (The Pandorica Opens)
* Speaks to the Doctor about her identity at Amy and Rory’s wedding (The Big Bang)
* Witnesses the Doctor’s death (The Impossible Astronaut/Day of the Moon)
* Reveals her identity to the Doctor and the Ponds (A Good Man Goes to War)
* The crash of the Byzantium (Time of Angels/Flesh and Stone)
* Visits her parents and tells them the Doctor is alive (The Wedding of River Song)
* Death (Silence in the Library/Forest of the Dead)

A few things that spring to mind,

Print out a Fife or finch i think it it is called. it has your name, address, passport number, occupation, father name, mothers name etc google around for a copy, and knock your own up one on word. otherwise as your progress further south you will need to hand write these forms at the ever increasing number of checkpoints and it will eat up a huge amount of time. print off like 30 copies or so. Also photocopy off a copy of your passport (b&amp;w) as you willl  need this for the hotels etc. 

There is good camping in morocco and western sahara, we used to drive along and then see a path towards the direction of the ebach and then just travel along it until we hit the beach.

The moroccan/mauritania border takes a while to get through 3 hrs and you then hit ""no mans"" land . there are lots of touts who are willign to drive you through the mind field.  we opted against this and just followed a big truck in front and that worked fine. 

the Mauritania border you used to be able to get the visa at the border. not sure what the situation is now though. you can buy  innsurance for the french speaing part of west africa here as well as mauritatian innsurance, get both .  Petrol is no readily avaliable in mauritania, so if you see a petrol station fill up the tank and the jerry cans, make sure you have jerry cans for the trip, 2 is plenty. we drove 700km  between petrol stations, lots of disiel but no petrol. mauritania is a bitsketch so check the forgein office befor ehand.

we missed sengal and went straight to mali where we were able to get visa's on the border. mali is pretty chilled, very green when we went, rainy season,  check out the mud mosque, they'll rip you off onthe boat trip over but nothign much you can do.

get the michllen map for west africa, invaluable.

the roads are pretty good onthe most part, we had a sump guard put on our ford fiesta, and it saved our bacon a number of times, so look into that.

if you can afford a two spare tires bring those, we went through 14 on the way, bring a french english dictionary, make sure you have steel rims onthe wheels, no alloys and bring a good hammer so you can hit the rims back into place when you smash into pot holes to hard and dent the rim,

france has expensive tolls onthe motor ways, so you can look to avoid those by taking the b roads and non toll roads,

the ferry from spain is interesting, everyone gets on and immediatley runs to the morroccon customs/immigration people and stand in line for ages, if you ferry is a long one, ours was 6 hours as we didn't cross at the Rock, we mearly went up an hour before we arrived and did all the paper work there, no line, easy peasy.

ignore anyone unless they have a unifrom or a gun when it comes to paperwork. that way you avoid all the chaps who are looking to make money on your lack of knowledge.

true,MtHammer,smith,Smith,"For what it's worth, I was **a lot** like you.  And it **really** does get better.  I actually gave up entirely on Doctor Who after watching *Aliens of London/World War III* for the first time.  It took several months and a lot of coaxing for me to give it a second try.  Even when I did, it really wasn't until *The Empty Child/The Doctor Dances* in season 1 that I finally started to get into it.  After that, I slowly started getting more and more hooked.  By midway through season 2 I was a full-on addict.

So here's what I would recommend. Try skipping ahead and watching two of the better stand-alone episodes from the show's later seasons.  First watch season 3's *Blink*, then give season 2's *The Girl in the Fireplace* a go.  Both are stand-alone episodes that you can just jump right into without any context and are widely regarded as two of the very best episodes ever.  If you don't like either of those, the show *probably* isn't for you. 

If you do end up liking them, you might want to consider jumping ahead to either the beginning of season 2 or the beginning of season 5 (Matt Smith happens to be my personal favorite Doctor, but that's neither here nor there).  I think it's highly likely that you'd enjoy either/both of those a bit more.  But, for what it's worth, you also haven't yet hit the best episodes from the 1st season.  Episodes 9, 10, 12, and 13 are all better than anything you've watched so far.  But I digress.

**Please.**  Do yourself a favor and don't give up just yet.  Take one *Blink* and one *The Girl in the Fireplace*, then call me in the morning.  Trust me, I'm a Doctor (Who fan).",0,1317970688,null,0,true,0,c2pk29h,t3_l3pi5,t1_c2pk29h,t3_l3pi5,1427698399,4,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,4

Be are generally considered at the moment to be the, or certainly amongst the best none cable providers. I pay £37 a month for a broadband with telephone line including evening and weekend free calls to landlines. Any additional calls are charged extra. 

Generally you'll be looking to pay £10 a month for landline rental before you pay for any calls, Broadband can range dramatically in price. If you're with Sky for TV or have an O2 Mobile phone then you can get it cheaper but as a part of something more expensive, but you can pay a lot less for broadband than I do. 

I'm not on minimum wage though (altough not too far from it) so I can afford to spend a bit more. 

A big issue though in terms of living costs is a lot of people my age and younger have debts. Loans, credit cards etc. I'm not trying to absolve them of responsibility or blame anyone but the person involved but if you earn minimum wage and took out a loan at 19 you're still paying off (which I did and was paying back at £178 a month) it's a huge expense on top of what you have to pay to live and it crippled me for a long time.

Because the majority of people in prison are scum with near-hilarious double-standards. Stabbing people and selling heroin is nothing to be ashamed of but you only have to whisper the word 'sex offender' to make them flip their shit.

The fact is an arrest is necessary when someone has been killed in your home, despite the fact that the defender has just been through a horrible event. If every killing in a house was not investigated one could see how people could get away (literally) with murder.

The only times someone has been prosecuted for a crime in relation to home defence is when it has gone too far: shooting someone in the back with a shotgun as they leave your property, chasing someone down the street and stabbing them etc.

This is such an emotive issue, and one that for the vast, vast majority of people is purely hypothetical. There's also a lot of misreporting about it, and people seem to think we're powerless to defend ourselves where courts have time and again proven that you are fully allowed to defend yourself and your property, including with deadly force where necessary.

I think it was Kenneth Clarke (the one Tory I actually like) who made it very clear that you can defend your home, including with a weapon. I think given the very low number of legal gun owners in this country that where a burglar has been shot the circumstances need to be looked at in a little more depth, but in general if you grab a knife, hammer, fucking katana if you have one lying around, and kill an intruder then you'll generally be in the clear.

Doctor Who is a delight because it shows us the evil horrors of the universe which yearn to destroy, enslave, and otherwise harm us... and then the Doctor shows up and saves the day!  No matter how bleak!  No matter how impossible!  The Doctor saves the universe again!

Torchwood is just like that... only the Doctor never shows up.

Not really. You must concede that there is a point where a high minimum wage would effect the employer (let's say for argument 20 pounds). Now big employers like tescos or asda might be able to afford paying their employees a lot more, but chances are there are a number of small and medium businesses who could in no way afford to pay their staff that salary and remain competitive. 

Sometimes employers can be arseholes and exploitative but it doesn't mean that changing the costs of doing business would not have any effect. 

There are some minimum wage earners who would be badly effected by the changes, if they were to receive less working hours (or potentially employment) then it could have a net negative effect.

I believe a minimum wage is an important thing in a developed economy but we also have to remember that altering it can sometimes do more harm then good (if handled incorrectly).",0,1317991023,null,0,false,0,c2pl52f,t3_l3xsc,t1_c2pl52f,t1_c2pktcj,1427698908,-1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,-1

They don't traffic shape, they are truly unlimited. One time I called them up as I was raging at the lag I was seeing playing call of duty online. They immedialtey started making adjustments on the phone while I pinged google.com. The response times went from 70 ms down to 15ms and the gaming experience was massively improved.

I have since moved and made a decision to leave sky and had to take BT as I did not have a number for people like BE to create an account with. BT are awful, we have a 35GB limit which I thought would do us ok for a month. Neither of us download torrents, or watch much iplayer, i tend to game a lot, browse reddit and my wife maybe spends an hour or two on youtube - we get through 35GB in about 2-3 weeks and so have to pay extra. I have had this out with them on the phone, but the person on the other end clearly has no clue and so I lose the will to live and end the call.

Seriously? What if you're on a single track road in a NSL and you join a main road and there's no sign? Is the speed limit 30MPH or NSL? 

If it is urban and there are no repeater signs it is 30MPH. If it is rural and there are no repeater signs it is National Speed Limit.

true,loony636,null,null,"I think its wrong to suggest that they didn't happen; the cracks were closed, but the Doctor, in fact, implies that history would continue if not for Amy specifically remembering her family (and him). That implies that everything else that Amy didn't change stayed the same as when they first happened, like the vampires, the Byzantium, etc.

Also, its been pretty clearly established that the cracks interact with causation in a pretty wonky way. Otherwise, if the angels all got trapped through the crack, why didn't the Doctor, Amy and River all disappear from the planet they were on and just go back to doing whatever they were before, since, technically, the angels never existed to get them there in the first place. Amy's ring sticks around, but there's bigger questions to be answered in that department.

The only thing that didn't really *happen* (if that's even a word that you can use when discussing Who) was Rory's time as the centurion. That all occurred after the Universe exploded, so when the Universe was returned to its pre-exploded position (now sans cracks), Rory's two thousand year stint never occurred. Now, he makes some comment in TGC about it being ""like a door"", which seems to fit with other constructions of aborted universes (e.g. Amy in TWORS makes some comment about the difficulty of remembering the conflicting universes, and when Amy 'remembers' the Doctor and Rory before that, etc.), but events like that are the only exceptions.

A biggest question is probably what 'happened' to the Dalek invasion. Amy has no memory of them ('Victory of the Daleks'), and that seems to suggest that the entire event 'fell' through one of the cracks. If not, then the Silents must have erased it.

Bollocks.  Basic rights are things like freedom of expression, freedom of religion, freedom from tyranny, fear, slavery and so on.  Having your rubbish collected on a weekly basis doesn't even come close.

And besides our waste food bins *are* collected every week.  That's all that really matters to me, particularly in the summer when maggots can become a problem.  

That said, I can see the problem for parents with kids in nappies, or perhaps elderly/infirm people who might have a lot of ""biological waste"" to dispose of.  The sensible thing here would be for the council to provide more accessible waste disposal points, perhaps like the bottle banks in supermarket car parks, community centres, and so on.

I have actually moved a master socket myself before and replaced it - you not meant to do this by some sort of law that BT state as its there property up to that master socket apparently, but its dead easy wiring and most people just go ahead and do it themselves anyhow as BT want up to 200 notes to do this - you have three wires that come in from the street; two for the line (in and out or A / B wires) and one is the bell wire and has the sufficient current to ring the bells on the older rotary phones. The bell wire is now redundant as digital phones sense the incoming call from the signal wires and use that to initiate the ring.

Anyhow when it comes to number assignment it seems to be only BT who can initially do this.

Had Be for about 3 years here. In that whole time, the connection has been too unreliable to make any online play worthwhile - multiple drops per day was common. When I started chasing Be over it, their staff were reasonably responsive - but when they decided it was a line problem, essentially became useless. Calling out BT engineers for line problems costs £120 - which is waived if they can identify and fix a specific problem. Be didn't provide me with any info I'd need to give the engineer, so were essentially saying ""Ring BT, pay them a hundred quid, you might get lucky"". Not to mention Be's broken DNS servers which don't work with debian.org subdomains properly.

When Infinity came live in our local area, I signed up - and the only downtime since it came on was the well publicized failure earlier this week in Birmingham, for about an hour. Yeah, BT's technical staff are worthless, but the service has been reliable - something Be never gave me. Not to mention the speed is almost 4x faster than my final few months with Be, without any traffic shaping or slowdown that I've noticed during peak hours.

Liverpool, Manchester, Leeds and Newcastle are the major northern cities, Birmingham is central, London and Bristol in the south (many more choices obviously, but I'd start with one of these)


Schools- hard to say right now, there are many changes taking place in the system at the moment. You have 'comprehensive' and 'grammar' secondary/high schools (grammar schools require an entrance exam- been a few years since I did them but I'm pretty sure it's still something like '11-plus exam'). There are also plenty of top quality public schools (private). University is now infamously expensive (£9000 a year + living costs on top of that) although it is still cheaper than over the pond, I believe.

Jobs- It totally depends on what you do, if you are looking for entry level jobs there's no chance right now. Mass unemployment and large migrant communities mean most basic jobs are snapped up very quickly. Even skilled work is hard to come by at the moment but this will probably change in a year... who knows.

The next season will probably also finish the character arc for Amy's character.  In series 5 she was head strong and loved her raggedy Doctor.

The opinions seems to come from a deep rooted place of ignorance about gun ownership.  Anti-gun people in the US try to use the argument that ""guns cause crime"", but they are dismissed as lunatics over here because guns are everywhere over here.  Outside of gang infested cities crime is very low here too.

I have lots of friends who own guns and none of them have ever committed a crime.  I own guns and I've never committed a crime.  My friends and I have concealed carry permits, and we've never felt the impulse to rob a store or shoot someone.  I've never even seen a crime in progress.  Nobody I know has ever been robbed.  I think a large part of that is because it's a well known fact that outside of cities people are well armed.  Probably every third house in our block has a gun and every 50th person on the street is carrying one.

If guns caused crime the US would be a shithole of lawlessness.  When in reality the only shitholes of lawlessness are in places where they ban guns like Chicago, Washington DC, and New York city.

&gt;The highest quality luxury blends are either from specialist tea retailers or from high end department stores like Fortnum &amp; Mason or Harrods.
&gt;
&gt;Just below that we have the quality everyday brands, like Clippers, London Tea Company, Twinings, Yorkshire Tea etc. The exact preference for these different brands will shift person to person.
&gt;
&gt;Then there are the regular tea brands that you see everywhere. These are: PG Tips, Tetley's, and (to a lesser extent) Typhoo. I strongly believe that PG Tips is perfectly fine, but Tetley's and Typhoo taste awful. No amount of factual data will cause that to shift.
&gt;
&gt;I personally believe that loose leaf tea tastes much better than teabag tea, but it's a bigger deal to brew. The leaves are cut bigger, so you have to brew it for longer, and cleanup is always a faff.

In essence, the best tea will be high quality loose tea leaves of your choice brewed very carefully.
