""Both Fox and Univeral Studios wanted a huge name to play The Eighth Doctor in the movie, to ensure a huge ratings success. The studios three top choices were Tom Hanks, Harrison Ford and Jim Carrey, all three of whom turned it down. Hanks, who is a fan of the classic series, turned down the role as he felt an American playing the role would not do the show's legacy any justice. Ford turned down the role as he didn't want to work in television. Carrey, who has never seen a single episode of Doctor Who, turned down the role as he felt it would cause outrage amongst Doctor Who fans if the role was played by someone who wasn't a fan of the classic series. Christopher Eccleston, who would later play the Ninth Doctor in Doctor Who, was offered the role of the Eighth Doctor but declined. Michael Crawford, Tim Curry, Eric Idle, Billy Connolly, Trevor Eve, Michael Palin, Robert Lindsay and Jonathan Pryce were all considered for the role of the Eighth Doctor. Palin was a strong frontrunner, but he didn't feel that he could do the role justice. Steve Martin, a fan of the series, badly wanted the part. Lindsay actually auditioned for the role, together withEddie Murphy, Anthony Head, Tim McInnerny, Tony Slattery, Liam Cunningham, Nathaniel Parker and Mark McGann (Paul's brother).""",0,1322365399,null,0,false,0,c331454,t3_mpy71,t1_c331454,t3_mpy71,1427934380,1,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,1

And the older episodes of Torchwood (seasons 1 -2 ) were more like a procedural cop show because Torchwood was a procedural cop show (with scifi elements). By procedural cop show - that means there isn't really an overarching plot line that unifies the entirety of the season. It is a string of loosely connected episodes that often forget about the events of the previous episodes. That's how CSI is set up - it is made so you can jump in as a new viewer at any time and get the idea of what is going on. 

Children of Earth / Miracle Day got away from this and endeavored to tell an entire self contained plotline. Admittedly - this was different from how seasons 1 -2 were presented (as a monster-of-the-week episodic show). Seasons 3 and 4 turned the show into a more serialized series. If you know your Who history, you'd know that old school Who was a much more serialized show than it tends to be in new Who (though Moffat's Who is deff more so on serialized slant than Davies' completely episodic run was).

So - whether you like it or not isn't in question - and I'm not trying to sway you.

true,steers82,num10,,"Ah... the seasoned Spurs supporter. 

I have been looking for the stats somewhere, but I can't find the facts for this story anywhere, so it could just be my faulty memory. There was a season about 14 odd years ago when we could have gone second around New Years Eve if we beat someone (Newcastle?). We ended up getting flogged. That season we didn't finish so well (I don't want to talk about it without being able to throw salt over my shoulder, but we didn't finish second). 

Anyway, the seasoned Spurs supporter knows, the goals, sometimes they come, and sometimes they come in the wrong direction.

I don’t really have a problem with Amy as a “person”.  Being a flirty and feisty redhead myself, I think she and I would have a blast together were she real.  As a character and companion, Amy makes me crazy.  More than anything, I hate the way that series 5 and 6 revolve around her.  Granted, I’ve only seen most of series 6 once.  But that doesn’t change the impression I was left with.  If an episode or plotline wasn’t about Amy, then it was about her daughter (don’t even get me started on River).  I’m aware that many of the things I’m about to list are the fault of Moffat and the other writers, and that Amy is a victim of their writing style.

•	I hate that Amy never seems to save herself.  Ever.  There are only two times when I thought to myself “Fuck yeah, Amy!” I was impressed with her sword skills in Curse of the Black Spot, and gratified when she effectively killed Kavarian in TWORS.  
•	However, it angered me that it took Amy until that episode to display any emotion over the loss of her daughter.  Even if she eventually accepted that things would work out for the best, I still expected her to put up some sort of fight to find Melody/River.  
•	I HATED how she treated Rory for most of series 5, but I do agree that Rory, Amy, and their relationship greatly matured as time went on.  It still left me with a bad impression though.  
•	I was put off by the fact that she didn’t seem to care that she got her parents back.  She doesn’t seem to care about her family (save Rory and River) much at all.  This probably annoys me more than it should because of how close the former companions have been to their families.
•	Amy doesn’t seem to have any sort of ambition at all.  When she’s so defined by her feisty nature and love of adventure, she’s seriously just going to live in Leadworth and be a perfume model? 
•	I’m annoyed by her sense of entitlement when it comes to the Doctor (a big problem I have with River and Reinette from series 2)

I also just never felt an emotional attachment to her that would allow me to overlook her “faults”.  I’m highly aware of Rose’s flaws (one of my best friends can’t stand her) but because I connected to her character emotionally, I love her all the more.

I believe that the lack of emotional expression in Moffat's characters is usually a result of his writing. We can list off the Rory thing as it just being the relationship Amy and he have. We can write off Amy's parents and River because of all the weird timey-wimey-ness. After all- Amy never really developed a family-mother-daughter relationship with baby Melody or real River. And her parents sort of never really existed and then did. It's probably very emotionally bewildering. But I do wish Moffat would devote an episode the processing of said emotions.

I wasn't a big fan of the whole ""Who will she choose? Rory or the Doctor?"" thing. Especially in Amy's Choice where it seems as if the Doctor is competing as well.

You have also verbalized a problem I have with Reinette, Amy, and River. The sense of entitlement. They're all Moffat characters, interestingly. In fact, I'd love them to meet Rose or even Sarah Jane. Just to give them a little perspective when it comes to the Doctor.

So I know where you're coming from. On the other hand, Amy is a very strong and (once she gets over her cold feet) fiercely loyal person. She's snarky, independent and clever.

And while she never seems to save herself, it seems that Rory can't help but die, and the Doctor can't help but be at the center of the universe's end. I think these are more tropes of Moffat and writing than Amy's character. We need stories with characters who need rescuing, but Rory isn't as big an impact, and the Doctor's supposed to be the guy with the answers. So it falls to Amy. Which is unfortunate.

true,simAlity,amy,Amy,"&gt;I hate that Amy never seems to save herself. Ever.

I think this is very real though.  The Doctor wouldn't be able to save *himself* let alone anyone else if he didn't have the TARDIS, sonic screwdriver, and psychic paper.    Amy has none of the above which makes her ability to at least *stay* out of trouble pretty impressive.  

She's not totally helpless though.  She knows how to pick locks and does so to escape the Silurians.  She even mounts a rescue attempt which fails largely because she is so badly out numbered.  She (or an alternative version) also took care of herself for 36 years while trapped in Two Streams and along the way tamed a handbot, made a sonic screwdriver and practiced her swordplay.  

&gt;However, it angered me that it took Amy until that episode [TWoRS] to display any emotion over the loss of her daughter.

Not entirely true.  She almost started crying when she told Rory that they had taken Melody and was astonished/overjoyed (by Amy standards) to have her back.  She was also heartbroken when Melody dissolved in her arms.  Then in the prequel to *Let's kill Hitler* she talked about how she couldn't stand the thought of missing Melody/River's childhood.  

That said, I too was disappointed that she didn't show the pain of losing Melody more often.  

&gt;When she’s so defined by her feisty nature and love of adventure, she’s seriously just going to live in Leadworth and be a perfume model?

Two possibilities. 1) Her day job is not who she is.  (I know my day job doesn't define me)  2) She's hoping the Doctor will come back to visit.  Besides, who gets a house (is GIVEN a house) and then moves away?

&gt;I HATED how she treated Rory for most of series 5,

Rory isn't even there for most of season five.  The first time we do is just after they have gotten together, two years before they become engaged.  Then we don't see him again until the *Vampires of Venice* where Amy really feels quite guilty about having not missed him and asks him to stay at the end of their adventure.  In *Amy's Choice* her feelings are definitely conflicted, and she is a bit of a jerk...but I think those false alarms were intended as a joke, and by the end she knows where her heart lies and doesn't act like that again.

When Rory gets killed she PITCHES A FIT. The first time she drove a campervan into a cottage, the second time, the Doctor had to manhandle her back into the TARDIS, otherwise she would have been sucked into the Time Crack along with Rory's body.  The third time she voluntarily drowns herself and God knows what she would have done to House in *The Doctor's Wife* had Rory not shown up when he did.  

Which is actually the source of a major gripe I have about Amy.  Why on Earth didn't she leave the TARDIS on her own?  Rory couldn't keep coming back to life forever.

&gt;I was put off by the fact that she didn’t seem to care that she got her parents back. She doesn’t seem to care about her family (save Rory and River) much at all.

You know how its hard to miss something you have never had?  That applies to parents as well.  I myself grew up without a mother, and honestly...I don't know how I would feel if she suddenly reappeared in my life.  That's how Amy is.  She grew up without parents, and she remembers life without them so suddenly having them back is more than just a little weird.

IMHO the biggest problem for those swimming against the tide is the market can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent. Plus in the UK the government dare not let house prices fall as the boomer vote has utterly captured the agenda, no matter what common sense proscribes in the longer term. It does seem to be coming to a gead now though as one can only push house prices ahead of wage inflation for so long. Recent schemes include:

* mates mortgages (buy with your friends as mortgages are 10 times wages)
* housing financed by a buyers pension
* larger multiples and longer terms
* government guaranteed schemes
* parental help

All the above show it's not a sustainable market. It will end - I just can't say when.

The UK is starting to panic about house prices. This is why the government are now intervening to subsidise the market. When you have a fiat currency that's falling, with most of it invested in non-productive assets that are hopelessly overpriced and one of the most indebted people in the world, it's *vital* to maintain confidence. But continually printing money causes inflation and this will tip them over the top.

I've heard in Australia prices are insane. It's funny - if you speak to so many Brits the one thing house price defenders always trot out is ""there isn't enough land""/""we are a small island"".

The government is effectively attempting to furnish every state school with a ""school bible"".

I can guarantee you that if you asked most teachers if they needed another bible in their schools versus virtually anything else you know what the answer is going to be.

Politicians don't need to be deciding what schools need. A slightly different bible is no use.

It's amazing how you are trying to shoehorn your appreciation of history into this argument.

Yes, we all know history is important - no one denies that.

Lady Christina says,  ""You speak their language?"" and he says, ""Every language."" 

So clearly the TARDIS wasn't translating for them, if Lady Christina couldn't understand the fly people, which would mean one of two things: The Doctor actually does speak every language, including English, or the TARDIS' translation powers are sort of embedded in him and follow him even when he's nowhere near the TARDIS, allowing him to ""speak"" any language when really he's speaking Gallifreyan, and allowing him to understand any language.

The old series didn't address it, and I think cast exclusively white actors as Time Lords [footnote]. The clearest evidence that regeneration can change skin color and/or racial features comes from the new series:

1. In the TV movie, the Eighth Doctor says that he can change species on regeneration. Logically, skin color should be a piece of cake.

2. In *The Sarah Jane Adventures* episode ""Death of the Doctor"", Clyde asks the Eleventh Doctor if he can change his skin color, and the Doctor says he can.

3. A part-Time Lord, River Song, was black for one of her regenerations.

On a meta level, there's little reason to think that whoever's casting the Doctor would balk at casting someone of color.

[footnote] An interesting edge case occurs in ""Planet of the Spiders"", Jon Pertwee's regeneration story.

Instead, you stupidly think that your mother's *maiden name* makes her English (never mind that *her mother* could be from the fucking moon...).  In fact, you could *almost* say that having a Celtic surname guarantees a *single* Celtic male ancestor, but it doesn't, as anyone along the line could have been adopted or simply *changed their name*.  Your mom could be from Pakistan and have a Celtic last name.  Hell, *I know*  people from Pakistan with Celtic last names - and I'm sure you do, too.

And, like I thought you'd pick up with the Prague comment, having a Celtic last name only means you might have some ancestor from *western Europe*, not from *Great Britain* and certainly not *necessarily* from *England*.

Mate, one of the only places Celtic languages are still spoken is *France*.

Finally, the most mind-boggling thing here is that Celts ARE NOT ENGLISH.

THEY ARE CELTIC.

You aren't a good liar, and even if the idiocy you pretend is true *were* true, it doesn't give you *any* logical basis on which to found your first stupid statement.

Oh, and clearly you are *not* ""more than happy"" to prove this bullshit, *or you would*.  You stupid, stupid person.

I'm not a expert on CV writing but i am a Union Learner rep and i'm currently heavily involved in redundancy support for my members at my site so I am able to spot good and bad CV's. I also run Job seekers workshops so i have a good idea what employers are looking for in a application, The content of your CV is fine but it needs ""Jazzing up"" with the important relevant information made to stand out more  . The average employer looks at a CV for 20secs before moving to the next.
 I don't feel there is enough clarity between the different sections a good way to separate is to simply put a line between each. Id move the DOB to the top of the page (although technically you don't need it) and id leave the driving license part for your covering letter.
Id use your covering letter to explain your highlights and experiences so that you can keep your employment history in two columns all on the first page then give more information about your education. This way a employer can see that even though you are 21 you have good work experience with qualifications to back you up. you don't mention having GCSE C or NVQ Lvl 2 maths on the CV and this will go against you if you haven't got it consider enrolling in a skills for life course all colleges and most local authority offer the courses free 

Finally look at the Grammar and Formatting. Check your activity's have capital letters and Justify the text to make it look neat. also don't be scared to go into some more detail about your activity Geocaching can be sold as a ligc and problem solving activity.
Oh and a top tip when you send a CV to a employer always send it as a PDF document that way it preserves your formatting ad doesn't mess up how its supposed to look when they open it at there end. 

Good luck hunting

What will happen is that there will be more higher-value properties in the richer area, and that will be the key difference between the areas.

Something a random monster (like the Ood early in series four) says may turn out to be THE important thing down the line, and if you skip the monster-of-the-week bits you could miss it and be wondering ""where the hell did that come from?"" later on. There's a surprising number of connections among these things- likely because if there weren't, it wouldn't be a monster-of-the-week show, it'd be a monster-of-the-week-attacks-bystanders-of-the-week-in-setting-of-the-week show, and you'd literally be wondering if you were watching the same program.",0,1322431758,null,0,false,0,c337d79,t3_mqke7,t1_c337d79,t3_mqke7,1428178047,3,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,3

 It's white leftys who are offended on the notion that it may offend someone else (which it doesn't [because they don't actually ask, they just assume]).

English heritidge is that of Anglo-Saxon &gt; German. So no, I don't think the christmas tree should be banned.

I don't care personally who, and of what race you are, if you move to another country and complain you deserve to be shot. 

Eitherway the fact people seem to think that comment is RACIST shows that people are too tense about these issues and are too quick to judge and persecute people as being racists.

true,widgetas,null,null,"Faith schools, by definition, exist to promote a particular faith (overall). Even if they are not actively telling children to be that particular religion, the name on the gate is an indication - and if they aren't promoting their particular faith well... then they won't mind having their name disassociated with the school, surely? Unfortunately we cannot really know whether or not a school is going to be the pushy kind or the 'quiet' kind, but the increase in support for faith schools by the government means that many thousands of children will be indoctrinated over the coming years.

Consider the schools that are around now: A friend of mine went to a Roman Catholic school. She didn't know that the Christian creation myth was just that, a myth, until she was 15! That and she is one of half the girls in her year who were pregnant before they were 20. How likely is it that these things are coincidences and aren't demonstrative of the issues with what kids are taught in such schools?

The point Dawkins is making in the question is a variation on his wish that children are not labelled as the same religion as their parents. It's a fair point when you consider how difficult religious questions are and how complex faith is. Children are automatically assumed to be the same faith as their parents. Dawkins (and others) are trying to make people understand that calling a child a ""Christian child"" or a ""Muslim child"" is as daft as calling a child a ""Conservative child"" or a ""Lid dem child"". When you apply the political label it's perfectly clear how silly it is because there's no way a child can understand the complexities involved in the various political movements. But give religion a thought, consider how many conflicting ideas there are and how many grown people struggle with ideas concerning faith, the notion that young children can understand their appointed religion begins to seem a little strange. There's a reason that the vast majority of people are the same religion as their parents: it's not because they were given a choice and freely decided ""Yep, mum &amp; dad got it right."" It's the same reason that you're most likely to be the religion that happens to be the most popular in the country in which you're born.

Many people believe that faith schools are divisive. Contrary to Cameron's opinion that they foster a sense of community, they *only* foster the community if you are a child of a family that belongs to that faith in the first place. A Roman Catholic school is fine for all the Roman Catholics (or children of RC's I should say) but for any child that doesn't have a family of that faith... well they can go fish. The child won't be mixing with the congregation outside of school because that child won't be going to church. The child is made to sit through religious ceremonies (that should have no place in school) as well as get taught various lessons that are heavily skewed by Catholic ideology, as well as being mis-taught or *not* taught at all about some issues (consider sex ed).    
The same goes for several other religions too, I'm sure I don't have to specify.

Religion *should* have no place in schools save for Religious Education. Religious *Instruction* is something completely different and children should not have a religion forced on them or essentially be taught to be a particular faith.",0,1322440266,null,0,false,0,c338kla,t3_mppx1,t1_c338kla,t1_c32wd0l,1427938012,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

I see not a huge amount of difference between him and Gary Glitter.  I suspect many other people think the same way, which is why King has been shut out of mainstream culture for so long.

The fact that he *still* claims he did no harm at all to his victims appalls me.  The victims themselves state they have been scarred for life, and King in essence responds 'they are incorrect, their brains cannot be functioning correctly for them to feel that way'.

King has served his sentence, and is a 'free' man (as free as a listed sexual offender can be considered free) yet this new, attempted character re-branding he is attempting leaves me with nothing but further contempt for the man.

Fixable.

&gt;""You graffitied"" to the end of the trap speech is a bit quiet so that could possibly need making a bit louder although the music in those scenes may be troublesome. Not so sure about how the first line of that bit would fit in as it conflicts with the song.

I'm not entirely happy with the bits between the ""seriously?"" and the start of the trap speech.  *Something* needs to be there, but I honestly don't know what.  Any suggestions?

&gt;The ""River Song 1 Dalek 0"" may want to stay on a little longer somehow.

But shouldn't it mean that when someone commits has finished whatever sentence is imposed on them, be it custodial or otherwise then the slate is wiped clean?

Or perhaps when we pass sentence we should take it into account. The judge should decide if the sentence is going to be indefinite or have a specific end to it. Perhaps that's what the sex offenders register is for.

And perhaps we should view convicted paedophiles as having a disease or addiction because it's often said, and sometimes by them themselves, that they will not be able to stop themselves offending again.

Sadly, it didn't establish or build up on the possible plot points and conflicts that arose throughout the first few episodes of the season. This episode has somewhat convinced me that the producers are no longer going for the same feel that the likes of [Tom Green](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm3407375/) or [Tom Harper](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2197777/) pursued in series one and two (in other words: say goodbye to continuity of any sort). Also, do know that they've been switching directors for every other episode of series three; thus far, I've been extremely dissatisfied with the co-director roles of Wayne Che Yip and Alex Lopez (they've jointly directed all the least impressive episodes of the third series so far, if you ask me).

The Freak of the Week formula works when pursued in conjunction with some sort of thematic direction, a plot or a point of conflict built up subtly every week to ensure that the series finale ties every episode before it together. Series 1 and 2? Absolutely, fucking brilliant. Series 3 in this respect? Not at all.

Also: Another probation worker gets killed? Fuck's sake. I'm not too irked by the fact that the writers killed him off; I'm annoyed that none of the deaths, in any of the episodes in the third series have held any consequence for the protagonists of the show. That is such a great way to reignite the series! To establish a common thread throughout the episodes which would in some way develop an overall story for once. Have one or two of them get arrested and brought to jail for the charges whilst the others seek refuge in Simon's flat. Let them devise a master plan to free their prosecuted peer/s, and dash like motherfuckers. And so on, and so forth. So many opportunities being passed by these writers...

It isn't so much a downfall for Misfits as an entire series as much as it is the downfall of the Misfits that **was** series one and two. Some fans don't really care about the *feel* of the show, the quality of the script, or the tongue-in-cheek humour; they take comfort in the fact that the characters are doing something, that somehow they still exist and haven't been doomed to television purgatory. This 'new' Misfits is written and directed differently. It's *way* too concentrated on the Freak of the Week format, so much so that (as I've said earlier) continuity in the third series is practically nonexistent. That element alone won't definitively kill the series, but it will change Misfits drastically (critical reception, viewership, etc.). You sort of need to keep your viewers on some sort of cliff - keep them wanting more. It was that nature of series one and two which drew in such a fanbase. The fact that every little thing shown from episode to episode could build up into a massive series finale with a wonderful twist. Even looking at the latest episode, you know it. Storytelling on a series-basis - on a greater-scheme-of-things plane, if you will - has pretty much disappeared in the last 5 episodes. Every show has a writing predicament every once in a while, but what I thought to be the 'sign of downfall' centered around the lack of continuity.

&gt;English heritidge is that of Anglo-Saxon &gt; German. So no, I don't think the christmas tree should be banned.

Judging by this, I'm sure you are obviously aware that our culture is a mixed heritage and we have taken on various aspects from various different cultures over the years. Cultures evolve and change, so I really don't get the logic behind trying to arbitrarily preserve a culture in its current condition.

The issue here is not minorities as you say, even though you then go on to write a full paragraph about how minorities behave. I do not even think the issue here is these ""lefties"", even though I think this is a relevant point. The issue here is a media that is keen to generate hits and sell units by playing on emotionally sensitive issues that they know they can use to rile people who are not the most rational. The myth of winterval, the cafe owners who had to close their cafe because of the objections of Muslims even though not a single Muslim complained, etc etc.

&gt;he just wants to preserve what little traditions the UK has left.

It's also weird that people want to defend a tradition, on the basis that they are preserving our traditions, when the tradition they are defending actually usurped the original traditions of this country.

Problem - the only people to respond will be patients, which skews the data towards the elderly and imminent/recent mums.

For them, opening up at weekends/evenings is not an important issue.

This does cause a problem as the person who might feel under the weather, but not bad enough to take time off work to see a doctor could be harbouring an imminent serious illness - which will cost a lot more to deal with if left unchecked.

Whatever the current traditions of the UK doesn't matter where they came from or what they replaced, they are there, and IF, IF people don't like it after coming here from another country and we provide them freedom, they should definately go somewhere where it isn't going to bother them. 

But as I said, it's not minorities that have a problem with this kind of thing, it's fearmongery and neo-liberals that put it into everyones head that everything has to be offensive to SOMEBODY, SOMEWHERE.

It annoys me though that people who think they are being respective and thoughtful of minorities when they complain about shit are actually just alienating them. Instead of calling racism why not wait until a person of that particular race has a problem with it before jumping to conclusions. That's what should take place, but it doesn't. You can say anything slightly judgemental, generalize or group and kind of people with one opinion and people will call racism. I think the definition of racism has seriously become distorted over the past 10-15 years.

...with no qualifier, no further explanation as to the issue. We're supposed to just take it at face value that if a white person was to suddenly find themselves in the minority this is a *bad* thing and that's that.

You see, my issue is a simple one. All my life, and I assume the lives of most actual minority people in this country, we've been told not to make an issue of race. We're too sensitive it seems. We should roll with it. When some well meaning do gooder liberal jumps up and demands more ""inclusion"" in certain spaces of society they're quickly shouted down or admonished in the press...sometimes rightly so.

When a black guy walks into the office and he's the only brown face there he should suck it up and stop dwelling on race...it doesn't matter. And you know what...that's very true and right.

The EDL position that we're being overrun by savages is absolutely absurd, it might be a bit annoying if your doctor speaks in a way you struggle to understand but it'd be a lot more annoying to not have a doctor or surgeon.   Well spoken doctors aren't hanging around jobcenters with signs offering to do open heart surgery for food - they're pretty much all employed in private hospitals and sports medicine / beauty treatment.   The government run special programs in former colonies to get people to come and train in England, as part of the deal they're compelled to work for a while; without this project the HNS would have collapsed under the sheer quantity of ill and injured years, if not decades, ago.  
  
England has never been a fairy land of egalitarian joy, the sun and mail readers who complain about the immigrants surely aren't suggesting we return to the pre-war social inequity, industrial revolutions work houses?  the squalor of the uneducated peasantry which came before?  It's strange to say but the working classes haven't had it this good since serfdom *(we work longer hours for less reward than we did as serfs)* - it's true, you can complain that your doctor speaks with a bit of an accent or that people who tend to be treated poorly where ever they live have decided to live in a group as to reduce the risk of violence and have a caring support network for their family.  our 'immigration problem' is certainly the least of possible problems; although to me it's the opposite of a problem - i like having psudo-authentic indian food available to take-away, i liked having my wrist fixed by a very intelligent and dedicated doctor with a fairly thick gujarati accent, and all the other little benefits.  
  
But the 'problem' is sold as if billions of brown people are washing ashore on dingies and lilos every morning, like Heathrow is a one way stream of muslims and africans who arrive and get whisked directly into a 4 bedroom house and given a car.  And yes, of course a lot of people want to come here and earn good money [just below our minimum wage] - we, England and the west, have installed and fight to protect an economic system by which our money is worth much more than theirs.  We dominate the economic markets simply because we used to have an empire, we use this leverage to force people to do tasks like sew footballs for a penny every ten then ship them here and sell them thirty pounds a pop - our economic system only works because we're exploiting a large portion of the world.  
  
Frankly i think a lot of ~~racists~~ ~~EDL~~ racists haven't even thought about the rest of the world or how the system works, they simply want to return to a dream they had about empire - probably because no one ever explained how shite it was for the 99% during those pith helmet days.",0,1322484955,null,0,false,0,c33d1mi,t3_mrh28,t1_c33d1mi,t1_c33cs1d,1427940096,10,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,10

&gt;(f) The appointment of Peers will be removed from number 10 Downing Street. A new office will be established at Buckingham Palace where advisors independent of the House of Commons will consider all nominations for the peerage on their merits. Ministers of all ranks will have no right to demand who will become a Peer. No jobs for the boys.

But I can see why it would not be popular everywhere. I like the idea of an independent peerage commission though.

&gt;(a) Reform the whole legal system so that justice becomes first and foremost the object of the exercise, not necessarily precedence, not petty regulations and paper formats and wordings, and not for lining lawyers pockets. This will be a very major undertaking.

Definitely agree

&gt;(f) Review sentencing for certain serious crimes, notably where drunken or careless drivers kill inocent people.

Yes please

&gt;(c) Banks - executives and traders found to be responsible for banks principal losses and/or liquidation will be dismissed and unable to work in the finance sector ever again. They will also be subject to forfeiture. No bank employee will be permitted, in law, to a bonus of any description if it can be demonstrated that under his personal management people have lost money as a result.

Difficult, but yeah agree in principle

&gt;(e) All taxes should be lowered as government involvement in our lives decreases. All people earning less than £15000 will be exempt from taxation.

All good

&gt;(g) Indirect taxes such as VAT and fuel duty must be slashed.

Sounds good

&gt;(7) Local Government:

&gt;(a) Will have to justify their spending. A roving audit commission will be established immediately for flying visits. 

&gt;No heads of local government or senior administrators thereof will be permitted a greater salary than the Prime Minister and other ministers.

Awesome

&gt;A Commission will be established to examine NHS bureacracy and spending and their recommendations, whenever made, must be acted upon immediately. Smaller hospitals will be brought back into full use wherever possible. It will be deemed unacceptable for anyone in Britain to have to travel great distances for ordinary everyday matters which could be dealt with locally. Britain's NHS is for ALL its people, not just for those in large towns and cities.

Account specific inquiries are done online through ""giffgaff agents"". More details [here](http://giffgaff.com/support).

You get 5 quid for referring someone and I think 2 quid for each person they then refer.

You can just topup and use that, but the real deal to giffgaff is their [goodybags](http://giffgaff.com/index/offer). You buy them each month and they give you various amounts of call time. If you don't use your phone much and don't need data then the 5 quid bag will give you 60 minutes and 300 texts. I get the 10 quid one that gives me 250 minutes and unlimited texts and data. As for if it's really unlimited, I use about 1.5 to 2gb a month and have never been warned about my usage.

One added bonus, freephone numbers are actually free!

It's just I have met people who say things like: 

""I bet you're not used to this weather in your part of the world"" to black people purely because they expect them to be African or Caribbean. 

Chances are this couple could be British, maybe never having been to Africa in their life, could be from any country on any continent with a black population. 

Not to mention a proportion of Africa is made up of lighter skin tones anyway. 

Just call them a black couple if you really have to be descriptive on ethnicity.

Becoming the show's head writer a few seasons later meant that he could build on it further. Until then, though, he was just taking advantage of the one or two episodes he got to write, and inserting his own theories and ideas.

While I don't doubt that he was hoping he would get to do more with it later on, I don't think he knew already that he was going to be taking over in the future. If nothing else, at least he could have left the thread hanging so that another writer could pick it up if they were so inclined.

true,widgetas,null,null,"I think the reasoning behind the spaces is two fold.

First - they are nearer to the shop, similar to disabled spaces, so parents with a brood don't have to walk through a (busy) carpark either carrying or towing youngsters. There's always a risk of a child scampering off and carparks aren't the most open and driver friendly places when it comes to small darting things running out of nowhere.

Second - There's extra room. I've no doubt everyone here has had to shimmy sideways into a car when they've not been able to open a door properly for whatever reason: a pillar, a bush or another car being too close. Very often parents have to bodily strap, or assist in strapping, a child into place, as well as wrestle them from and to a buggy or trolly. As such the hatched markings around the spaces ensure they have enough room to do this without causing damage to their or other cars, as well as meaning they can get the door open far enough to manhandle little Johnny out into the sunlight while he's performing an impression of a screaming starfish.

I think the ""closer"" aspect is secondary to the 'space' aspect, though the reasoning is sound and makes to save children from being injured, maimed and/or killed. The inconvenience to a parent or injury to a child outweighs any damage done to someone like myself who has to park a little bit further away, and I say that as someone who is generally quite grouchy when it comes to kids or people assuming they have rights or their opinion matters more simply because they spawned.

true,tingalingating,null,null,"I live in Cambridge.  I experience this sort of thing approximately once a quarter.  It always happens, without fail, in the evenings, usually after 2000.  The last time I got racially abused was about 3 weeks ago when a man called me a ""dirty f***** paki"" and threw an empty bottle at me.  Ironic given that he was more swarthy looking than me.  

The incidents that stand out most are: (i) had a group of ""lads"" line up and block my path as I rode through the city centre at about 2200 one Friday. Culminated in them surrounding me and roughing me up by punching me and kicking me. (ii) Had a young teenager and his father stop the car they were driving in so the adolescent could get out and shove me onto the pavement (was on my bicycle), laugh like maniacs, abuse me and peel away in a smoke of rubber (iii) Have a man try and knock my turban off my head in the middle of the street on a weekday afternoon and (iv) Have a (civilian) woman shout slurs at me in the council offices because I happened to be there at the same place and time (was changing my council tax address) and she was having issues with her housing benefit.

Only last week I was in the city centre around about 1900 on Tuesday to see an older black woman and her son being abused by a drunk white male at the bus stop outside the John Lewis/Grand Arcade.

Nobody really does anything.  People look away or shift uneasily.  When the men surrounded me somebody must have called the police because they showed up a few minutes later, and for that I'm very grateful.  In the council offices the person dealing with the woman said her behaviour was inexcusable and that she would have to mind her language and tone, but other than that I can't say I've had people confront abusers on my behalf.  I don't really mind people not intervening, I can understand why they don't. I just wish people would stick around albeit at a safe distance because I might need hospitalisation soon and will probably not be in a state to request it myself. Finally, there is no typical ""type"" of abuser.  I've had teenagers abuse me and (people I would consider) pensioners.  I can't comment on where the people are from (Cambridge or surrounding villages) because I have never really spoken to them.

I'll conclude with my personal thoughts on the subject.  I understand that generally Britain is not racist and people here are more forward thinking, tolerant and accepting than probably anywhere in the world.  However, as a person who is visibly different in skin colour, I _do_ feel scared and nervous when I'm out and about, especially at night.  One could argue that I'm no less or more likely to suffer a racial attack than, say, an attack from a man with a Samurai on the street but my _personal_ experience leads me to believe otherwise. YMMV.

Secondly, there's a reason why retrospective or post facto legislation is frowned upon in most cases.  You can't just go around unpicking centuries of jurisprudence and expect it not to cause a shit storm - the law is all about providing some sense of certainty from ambiguity, and whilst many laws, precedents and verdicts may be wrong, you have to have a strong sense of what is just and unjust when making things legal or illegal decades or even centuries before there was a law which said so.  There is a presumption of legal changes not being retrospective, and in most cases this is right; certainly there is way too much time travel in this document.  

Thirdly, there was a reason the old law of 'motor manslaughter' went the way of the dodo; juries simply wouldn't convict because they felt that there but for the grace of god went they.  Maybe culture has changed sufficiently to try this again, but then again, maybe it hasn't.  Just because you change the law, doesn't mean you'll necessarily get what you want.

In my own recent experience of a more or less slipped disk and taking half an hour to walk a distance that would normally be under 10 minutes, I can be more understanding of the person in my way who is walking very slowly with a limp.

Compassion versus equality - Compassion would lead us to understand that while treating people equally is a lovely thing when it comes to those who are treated on the 'negative side' of unequal, allowing wiggle room for those who have trouble operating on an equal level is no bad thing.

Treating people equally would, the way you describe it, mean: no dropped kerbs; no ramped entrances; no lifts but only stairs; no lower urinal for young or short men, no seats at the front of buses with extra leg room; no kneeling buses; no braille signs; absolutely **no** dogs... Am I making sense?

Treating everyone equal is fine until you find someone who is not equal. That is to say, they don't enjoy an existence unfettered from, for example, lack of total mobility.

When you have a small child they sit in a baby seat (they have to by law and its daft not to use one)- this means you often need to fully open the door, lean in and sometimes lift the baby car seat out and it then connects up to a pram base, or you need to lift out a whole toddler with legs kicking around. To do either of these you need more room which is why they provide the bigger bays, much more then a single person who just needs to scoot their butt in and out of the car.

Another reason of course is so that the parents who need enough room to get a seat out don't accidently plough the door into the wing of your nice shiny car, so by you taking up a place which is not for you, it may well add to someone else bodywork costs.

We're obviously prepared to spend some money. Hell, we would have spent 40m last January if Atletico had accepted our Aguero bid.

In the summer we only spent 5m and we gained ~19m from selling Crouch, Palacios, and Hutton and we're not even paying half of Adebayor's wages allegedly. 

In January I'm sure we'll sell a few more too, like Pav and Giovani. 

I don't think Harry and Levy are stupid. They know we're one Adebayor injury from being in big trouble. We need at least one striker in January, especially if Pav ends up leaving. A central defender would be another priority.

A change of more than 10%, and you can argue it represents a significant deviation from the terms and conditions of your agreement, and is one that is not in your favour. You can ask to remain on your current plan, or if this is impossible (our system only does this, etc. etc.) you can ask for termination of contract due to them breaking the terms - even if they agreed to notify you.  (i.e. If you wrote to them saying that due to changes in YOUR lifestyle, you are no longer able to afford to pay them the full amount, and offer to reduce it by a couple of quid, they'd laugh at you - they've got to negotiate, they don't have an option.)  However, most places can't\won't\don't know how to negotiate, so the simplest resolution for both parties is termination of contract.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt; I see what you're saying, but I reserve the right to call someone out for being a cunt even if the person they are being a cunt to isn't present. It still affects me. It's not always about being respectful and thoughtful of minorities. If I witness behaviour that makes me feel sick, I am well within my rights to object, regardless of whether it is directed at me or not. This is part of our culture.


Yea of course you have the right to object if it offends you, if it doesn't offend you then you shouldn't or wouldn't be objecting. The fact is these days it's like a bad habit to object to anything and either say it's turning gamers into killers and banning anything remotely brain stimulating on television for children when they don't play games, and they don't have children. 

If someone is acting what I see as racist to someone else and it bothers me, but the person it's directed at isn't bothered at all then nothing should be done. (i'm not talking about someone saying they're not bothered when they are btw).


&gt; But on the other side of the coin, if you're one of the residents and you don't want anything to change, ever, then you are not living in the real world.
 

If you're suggesting that someone can waltz in to anothers home and demands changes then I disagree strongly. Part of the fact people move locations is for a better place, but the grass is always greener obviously.

The people who have moved here have been given the freedom to do so, and should show respect for the country by not complaining about things that don't directly affect them anyway. But as I said this doesn't really happen.

&gt; I think this a wee bit melodramatic. This isn't actually happening in many places. We've got loads of traditions left, some change and now we have new ones, and the notion of getting everything that is British banned for being offensive just isn't an accurate reflection or reality.

You should try living in Bradford for a while, infact, everyone should. You'll see that multiculturalism just doesn't quite work and whilst one tradition creeps in another is forgotten.

* (k) enabling the seller or supplier to alter unilaterally without a valid reason any characteristics of the product or service to be provided;

That doesn't really mean anything. No ""paper formats and wordings""? Huh? If it means replace legalese with everyday language, well, legalese is there for a reason: everyday language is ambiguous.

If the law against theft said just ""theft is illegal"" (everyday language!), then what counts as theft will be different depending on what judge gets to sum up to your jury. If it's not clear whether what you did is ""theft"" by the everyday meaning, well, it's a crapshoot.

So Bob goes free for doing the exact same thing that you've just been convicted for. There's no consistency, no justice, and no rule of law.

As it is, theft is ""the dishonest appropriation of property belonging to another with the intention of permanently depriving them of it"". Most of those words are defined further in the statue, and there's a huge body of case law clarifying precisely what it means.

 I was mocking the culture that says its okay and normal if you are fat.  And I think that is a problem - that we as a society consider being overweight normal.    That real women are fat - has become a prevalent attitude. 

A while back, I saw a movie set in the 1960 or 1970 about school kids and they were bullying a fat kid.   What surprised me is that the fat child by todays standards is normal.  

But you do make a valid point.  I am sympathetic regarding the struggles and psychological battles an individual may face.   And the importance of self esteem in overcoming their issues.

true,lilythekitten,eng-northumberland,The NORTH,"&gt;Are there any sanctions from parking in the parent spaces? If so, are they enforceable?

Potentially yes, and no.

In a private car park, it's questionable whether ANY sanction is enforceable - I'm not aware of a single case that has been won by a private parking company against an individual for breaching the 'contractual agreement' of parking. Generally accepted legal advice if you get a fine for parking in a private car park is to just ignore it, along with the series of threatening letters the PPC will send. Eventually they give up, since it's not worth actually taking you to court and there's a pretty good chance they'd lose if they tried.

That being said, I'm very interested to see who he brings in during the transfer window.

I spoke to an HIV epidemiologist about this once. With any infectious disease, you need to reach a certain threshold of infections within a community in order to get the exponential explosion into the wider population (which is what the models were predicting). 

That threshold is determined by several factors, not least of which is the transmissability of the disease. Essentially, HIV is a lot less infectious than the models in the '80s assumed, so that threshold was never reached, and we never saw anything like the numbers of infections that were predicted. 

The 'threshold' level is dependent on several factors which I think are still unclear, but include things like co-infection, which may go some way to explaining differences in infection rates between the West and Africa - if you are infected with another STD your immune system may be more susceptible to HIV infection, the virus can cross mucous membranes easier etc. ",0,1322519058,null,0,false,0,c33hpb3,t3_ms4x5,t1_c33hpb3,t3_ms4x5,1427942359,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

* [fighting words](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fighting_words) -- You can't make a direct and personal attack on someone, a la ""Go back to where *you* come from,"" ""I am English, what have *you* got to say to me?""

Of course, legally it doesn't matter if it *did* start a fight, but that a reasonable person would think that it *could* have done.

Freedom of speech is one thing, but this is completely beneath any standard of civilized discourse.  Maybe she should move to Texas.

I'm well aware that I can put people's backs up when I make an edit or point out that someone is downvoting. People assume that I'm butthurt that my karma took a knock. Of course, it's nice to be validated, but to my mind the downvoting is a negative not because it makes your comment karma drop, but because it's demonstrative of a wish to silence people or arguments that the downvoter doesn't agree with.

Downvoting someone you're in discussion with isn't just the web equivalent of sticking your fingers in your ears, but sticking them in other peoples' ears too. I don't like that very much.

So I make snarky edits and give people the impression I touch myself over my comment karma. So be it, but on several occasions the person I'm in discussion with stops downvoting me in the ensuing conversation. I like to think I helped the world a little bit, that I helped a fairy get its wings.

*what I'd suggest for someone wanting to do Zoology or Ecology:

Year 1: Biology of Cells, Physiology of Organisms, Evolution and Behaviour

Year 2: Animal Biology, Plant and Microbial Sciences, Ecology

I didn't actually do the latter in each year, so it's still entirely flexible and will give you a lot of choice in later years, but have a look at the module lists for the [first](http://www.cam.ac.uk/about/natscitripos/ps/p1a/)/[second](http://www.cam.ac.uk/about/natscitripos/ps/p1b/) year to see if there's anything that particularly stands out.

edit: it's also worth noting that there's no specific Ecology course in the third year, and you'd either do Zoology or Plant Sciences, both of which have ecological options (most are actually shared between the two departments).

A generation later most saw that well, that's just not cricket but tradition stated for them that men aren't poofters and it shouldn't be allowed. We moved on from that of course, gays are no longer chemically castrated and the Tikka is almost considered traditional.

*Tradition* is flexible and it's no surprise that the men such as Gregory Lauder-Frost and Merlin Hanbury-Tracy are behind this, trying to keep their own ideals of tradition alive.

Traditional Britain to someone of my generation when I am of the age to start using the term, will be vastly different to what these privileged men see it as.",0,1322526927,null,0,false,0,c33ixtj,t3_mrx66,t1_c33ixtj,t3_mrx66,1428177802,5,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,5

A lot of individuals on here initially thought that without Nathan, 'the writers of the show could actually start concentrating on the story rather than simple bouts of humour' - and to those people I gesture [this](http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lmw2eaWNqh1qbexbq.gif). Nathan's character brought the wittiest, nastiest, and down right weirdest out of the writers. The story was *already* amazing, and Misfits could have easily been seen as the British drama of the year - but it was the character and consequent humour of Nathan which separated Misfits from other well-known and loved drama series.

The problem with most fans, as it is with most human beings - is the issue of *moving on*. Most of the hatred and disappointment directed towards the character of Rudy comes from the fact that fans see him as a *replacement* for Nathan. He isn't. He's just a crass Englishman who happens to come into the series as Nathan leaves. People are defining Rudy by the standards they had for Nathan - it's like saying that you don't like the second probation worker because she's nothing like the third. That reason in itself is so ludicrously idiotic; she's a completely different person, for fuck's sake.

That being said, it is the writers' job to make sure that we don't find ourselves missing Nathan in the process of watching each new episode.

true,[deleted],null,null,"Watch some of the classics on Netflix (If you have it), they've got a good selection, imo. Watch elsewhere if not.. The Dailymotion users Tardismedia and matrixarchive have all of the serials. 

The stories are fantastic, and once you get used to the fact that they were made in a different era of television they can be very enjoyable. Some of my favorite Doctor Who moments are in the classics, and I would recommend watching some of Tom Baker's serials (4th Doctor, he was on for-fucking-ever), or just watch a bunch of Doctors and figure out what you like best. The best part of the classics is getting introduced to the other Time Lords, they actually played a pretty big role in the show before the relaunch. 

If you can get into the medium then I *highly* recommend listening to [Big Finish](http://www.bigfinish.com/) audio dramas, the 8th Doctor pretty much only exists through these and he's absolutely fantastic. 

Edit: And as far as the 1996 movie, it's hard to watch, the only way it's even remotely enjoyable is because Paul McGann (8th Doctor) was in it and he's a spectacular actor and creates a great character. His introduction is the only thing I feel is canon about the movie, everything else is Americanized shit and definitely *not* Doctor Who.

She was an okay one-off character in an episode that has been kind of ruined for me because it's so over-reccommended. I just don't see why so many people love her, except maybe because she was attractive. 

I don't know if Moffat's to blame because of his writing of female characters... I've never really gotten that impression, though the only new, recurring female character he's written since he took over is Amy. And I'm sure I'll get downvotes galore for this, but Amy can really be a bitch sometimes, and most of it seems directed at Rory. 

I don't know if I'd call it a disney princess complex, but I think that Martha's reaction to the Doctor is one a lot of women would have. Mysterious good-looking stranger shows up in your life, does crazy-awesome shit and can travel through time and space. Oh, yeah, and then he *did* kiss Martha shortly after meeting her. I can see how that would lead someone on to believe that there could be something there, while the Doctor just remained oblivious to it for pretty much the whole 3rd series. In any case, Martha got over it once she realised there's no way anything was going to happen between the two of them and moved on instead of wasting more time pining. She left the Tardis on her own volition, which can't be said of any of the other characters.

I wrote this in another thread:

""I don't understand why everyone keeps talking about the children, the children, think of the children. The children likely don't understand it, and even if they're scared briefly it will pass. What about the people she was targeting? It seems from many comments here and elsewhere that they should just have taken it in stride. Like it has no effect to be told to go back to where you came from, to be told you should be ejected from your own country, because goddamn it, don't you get it you ethnic minorities? Your home will never be your home, even if you were born here, even if it is all that you have known. Your community will never be your community, and you'll never know whether the next person you meet, or the next person you sit next to on the bus, might be one who wants you kicked out.

You think this is an isolated incident? You think the woman got her racism because she is just ""thick"", as if she lives in a vacuum?

http://www.newstatesman.com/blogs/the-staggers/2010/07/express-british-national-party http://www.newstatesman.com/blogs/steven-baxter/2011/05/white-another-free-frightening-2

And then people will complain about the minorities, the ""ethics"": Oh why do they always keep themselves to themselves? Why don't they feel a sense of belonging? Oh why won't they integrate?

The [stereotype effect](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stereotype_threat) is real, we all know from history what happens when minority populations become the target. The people on the tram from ethnic minorities are human beings. Someone mentioned how the guy behind her was calmed down by a girl who gave him a hug, but they only cared about how he was going to get laid, haha. Why do you think she felt he needed a hug? Why did she want to comfort him? Because she had empathy for how it felt, to be a person of ethnic minority and be subject to this on a fucking tram ride.""

And since people seem so fond of the slippery slope, let's see what happens in the other direction: imagine a bus full of people like her, and one or two people of ethnic minority. What then? They should just leave every bus/tram where this happens to them? Does Rosa Parks have to do it all over again?

Free speech, like almost everything in life, is not absolute. It's not an issue of purity. It's messy, the line is difficult to determine, but we try our best to find a balance between protecting people and protecting free speech. I don't personally want her punished, and certainly don't want the kind of mob persecution that always happens with these things, especially where people call her a chav and things like that, as if a middle-classed person in a suit cannot be just as racist. But I do want her charged, I would like her to be helped to see how misinformed she has been, and most of all, I need the people who were on that tram to know that this is their country, their community, and we will protect them on a tram or bus ride home.

There are about, what, 783 episodes of Doctor Who? At least 14 solid days of watching if you strung them together continuously.

There's approximately (vaguely around) 422 radio dramas by just Big Finish (BBC made some too)

There are at the absolute barest minimum 413 novels (as of probably in 2009 so we're leaving the Smith novels and some Tennant).

If each novel takes 5 hours to read, and each radio drama is one hour (averaged but not really accurate)

All that totals to over 117 solid days worth of Doctor Who entertainment. We're excluding the Target novelisations, anniversary specials, things like Scream of the Shalka, live performances, and the movies. Oh and the comics (and those have been going on since 1964- so probably thousands of those). This also excludes relevant documentaries, special features on DVDs, and informative novels about the show.

""You lot"" and ""brilliant"" were very quick adaptations, for example.

Most of the differences are tiny, and then some random ones throw you for a loop.

Virgin aren't expanding their network anywhere. Except for people who live literally a street or two away from their present network, where they'll consider it if they can make money. 

The cable companies that make up Virgin all went bankrupt in their pursuit to cable up the country. Presumably Virgin isn't trying to do that again.

&gt; Still, BT decides to take their experimental services to places like Cornwall, when there are certain areas within the capital that below dial up Tx/Rx speeds.

FTTC/FTTP are not experimental services - they are commercially available services rolled out across the country in an ever increasing scale. 

Cornwall is getting it because the EU and the council are helping pay for it (although BT is still stumping up a lot of the money). A county that normally gets nearly bugger all in investment and whose broadband isn't all that great. Certainly not on the same ""/r/firstworldproblem"" level of ""I can't get on Megaupload"". 

I would find it quite hard to believe that there is anywhere in London getting dialup speed on their broadband connection consistently and not due to factors like being on Plusnet, who must surely win the award for over the top traffic shaping. Meanwhile slow broadband is a very real issue in counties like Cornwall.

As someone who lives in Cornwall I'm quite glad we're getting something first, whereas otherwise we'd never have it. While you enjoy cheaper broadband, I have to pay more and get less until FTTC comes.

People will probably just see you as an american rather than american indian specifically. And there's no racism against americans! Usually just friendly interest.

My overall experience has been great. They're very supportive here. The resources are great. The lecturers are mostly good. If there are any problems with lecturers they are quick to replace the person teaching that class and offer catch up sessions to make sure everyone's ok. 

If you like to play sports there are loads of teams to get involved with and the AU (athletics union) offer full insurance and physio when you sign up. The gym here is large and has loads of new equipment and a decent sized swimming pool. I've tried so many new sports since getting here!

When I was 13 I was asked to perform at Rupert Murdoch’s
wedding in New York. When it came to the payment for my work,
my management at the time informed me that either there would be
a £100,000 fee (which was the biggest fee I’d ever been offered) or
if the fee for my performance was waived, I would be looked upon
favourabiy by Mr. Murdoch’s papers. Despite my teenage business
head screaming ""think how many tamogotchies you could buy!!"", I
was pressured into taking the latter option. This strategy failed.., for
me. In fact Mr Murdoch’s newspapers have since been some of the
worst offenders, so much so that I have sometimes felt that there
has actually been a deliberate agenda. While newspapers such as
Mr Murdoch’s have not helped my career, they have certainly
helped damage it, as I will explain below. I do of course accept that

He's one of the most-fouled players in the league, because he does the two things that cause you to get fouled: quick changes of pace, and clever tricks to fool defenders as to which way he's going. That'll get you fouled all the time, without any intent from the defender. A player like Suarez is going to his the deck a lot.

One problem is the whole inquest after every foul about whether there should be a booking, with players on both teams yelling at the ref and waving their imaginary yellow cards. This is ruining the game, but it's not Suarez's fault. It's been going on for a few seasons now. 

99% of the fouls on Suarez are accidental late trip because Suarez was too quick for his opponent. No need for drama, it's free kick, get back to playing. There are 20 people on the pitch who do not need to be involved and  they should all shut up.

Then the other thing is Suarez's reaction to being fouled. Yes, he overreacts. But he overreacts to everything else too - he is distraught when he misses a chance, he is effusive in his praise for a good pass from a team-mate and he is happier than anyone else in the stadium (except perhaps Kenny) when a goal is scored.

Being black isn't a choice. Being gay isn't a choice. Having mixed parentage or the place in which you are born, isn't a choice. Vocally implying those people are 2nd class citizens, or should ""Go home"" etc. is legislated against because, for one, it is behaviour that upsets people. This is different to upsetting people because they are wearing a red hat, say, because such things as race, sexuality etc. are intrinsic and cannot be changed.

That's not to say you can't be racist, but our society has decided that if you manifest your racism then you will be punished.

Would you agree that there is less racism in the UK today than there was, say, 20 or 30 years ago? Personally I'm of the opinion that education and intolerance to intolerance are a very effective way of ridding groups of such behaviour and opinions. Kids aren't innately racist. Though they'll spot differences, they don't conclude that it means another person is inferior because of that difference. As the racist adults disappear, racism tends to go with them, I think.

You simply deferred to the existing stalking/harassment laws, but didn't answer the initial question as to if you believe this is a valid law or not.

How is that *not* directly answering his question?  He asked if I have the right to not be harassed, I went so far as to point out exactly what the law is.  Further, I *obviously* have these rights:  the debate is whether or not the rights go too far at present.

&gt;So, again removing any racial or violent connotations, do you feel free speech should stretch to a person literally being able to say anything they want to you personally, no matter where, when or how?

Again, again, again, *no*.  You can't tell me that my mother is dying at the bottom of a lake if she, in fact, is not.  If you do, you have committed a crime and a tort and you are liable for damned near anything that happens to me *or those around me* as I try to save my mother's life.  

You can't yell ""FIRE!"" in a cinema if there isn't a fire.  If you do, you have committed a crime.  You are going to be criminally and civilly liable for all *sorts* of harms.

You can't tell me that my wife is being raped around the corner, unless she really is.  If you do and something happens as a result, *you* are going to be liable.

There are *innumerable* cases in which you cannot say ""whatever you want"" to me, and should not be able to do so.  

If, however, what you say does not *incite* me to action and is *not likely* to incite me to action, then you've done nothing wrong.  I don't care about the content of your speech if it does not provoke me to act.

&gt;I think people seem to mistake free speech, the right to air ones views on life and society as a whole, criticism of ones government or other authorities and the free dissemination of information without hindrance, with the carte blanche ability to ignore societal expectations on politeness and manners and hurl insults at others.

I think you decide that those who disagree with you must be lacking in some understanding of how you see things.  This is not the case.  There are people in this world, some living in London, who think that having sex outside of marriage is one of the *worst* violations of ""societal expectations"" and ""politeness and manners"" and, hell, just plain old *morals*.  So much so that there have been *honour killings* in the UK!  The fact that you pretend there is a single, cohesive notion of politeness and manners is the root of the problem with these types of law.

Might does not make right and having a majority opinion on your side does not make you right, either.  Hell, historically, it's made you wrong more often than not.  

If the verbalizing notion that the UK should not have, I dunno, Americans in it is not an expression of ""the right to air ones views on life and society as a whole"" then I don't know what is.  A free society *must* be able to discuss who can partake in that society.  Don't pretend that all people are allowed - they aren't.  People go to jail, people get deported, people are denied entry - and for all sorts of reasons, many of which are racist at the end of the day.  I *want* to live in a society that is racially ignorant.  IE, a society that is no longer aware of ""race"" as a concept.  It's foolishness.  It has no benefit to wider society, IMO.  However, I want to be able to *say* that.  I want to be able to *argue* with people who believe that no Canadians should ever be allowed in because they are *racially* too damned nice.  

I'm not offended by the *language* they use.  Why should I be?  That's garbage from Puritanism and religious zealotry - and it's *bigoted*.  People *talk like that* because, primarily, they are undereducated.  They use ""nigger"" or ""pikey"" or whatever because of ignorance.  Not because they are *bad people*.  There are no *bad words*, either.  That is magical thinking.  There are bad *concepts*, and I agree that words can convey concepts (obviously), but bad *concepts* are something we discuss and diffuse - not silence.

She's spouting it because she sees something she doesn't like and makes a massively list of categorically unfair assumptions, and then she acts.

Let's see if we can clear this up.

* You complain a law is bad.
* Someone asks if X application of said law would also be bad.
* You indicate that said action would actually be an application of Y law...you make no indication if you agree with said law or not. at this point I must assume to do.
* I point out that she has in fact been charged with a crime more in line with Y law, which at this point I'm assuming you agree with.

Look, this all hinges on which right you personally feel is more important to *you*. You have the right to live your life in any way you so wish as long as it does not impinge on other peoples rights. Other people have the right not to be harmed by you, or have their liberty hindered by you or your actions. 

I feel that the one lady on the trams right not to be verbally abused is more important than the other ladies right to verbally abuse her. Either way one person isn't going to get their way. In these cases we have to cede to the law, and unfortunately for you, the law is on the side of the woman who has the right not to be abused.

&gt;is legislated against because, for one, it is behaviour that upsets people

And therein lies the rub, and takes us *right back* to the dubstep example.

&gt;This is different to upsetting people because they are wearing a red hat, say, because such things as race, sexuality etc. are intrinsic and cannot be changed.

Michael Jackson, anyone?  I kid!

But to say that sexuality is intrinsic and cannot be changed is frankly ignorant.  *Gender* can be changed, for crying out loud, and sexuality is fluid as hell.  Regardless, how one *acts on* their sexuality or race or what have you *is* a choice.  Where one *moves to* is a choice.  

Saying ""go home"" is not exactly a highly literate argument, I concede that, but believing that the country is overpopulated (it is) and that there are insufficient resources (there are) and that in a down economy it makes no sense to take on more people in a welfare state (which this is, and which is patently true), and that there are benefits to having a culturally homogeneous society (there are!) are all valid, acceptable, *welcome* arguments that need to be addressed and discussed.

Putting people who feel that these arguments rise to the level of needing to be acted upon *into jail* is foolishness and, likely, bigotry.

Obviously, I hold a nuanced opinion on these things, and I realize that this woman is likely unequipped to discuss this topic at the level that I could.  That doesn't make her opinion less valid.  She needs to be educated, not threatened with violence (which *is* what government action is).

I think it is patently clear in the unfolding of human history and even *more so* in the last several election cycles in the UK, US, Canada, France, Spain, Germany, etc, that, when given a choice between a benign ruler and a lying, thieving bastard, people choose the bastard.

true,widgetas,null,null,"&gt; It's not? This changes on a weekly basis

It really doesn't, not with regards to general psychological consensus, I believe. The ""choice"" aspect I think is perpetrated by groups who *need* it to be a such (i.e. some religious groups).    
Also consider that homosexuality is found across nature, even when there are abundant members of the opposite sex. I think that the idea that homosexuality is a choice stems from the idea that it is a sin: ""people want to sin/be sexually deviant"" and that in doing so they are ""going against nature"". With nature to have so many examples of homosexuality that undermines that line of argumentation.

&gt; But to say that sexuality is intrinsic and cannot be changed is frankly ignorant.

... Oh really? As I say, I think the consensus among psychologists disagrees. Let's be clear, here: You can choose not to act on your sexuality, but you cannot choose which sexuality you are. For example I could choose to have sex with men, but that wouldn't change the fact that my sexuality is heterosexual.     
Of course sexuality is not black and white, but that's not the issue at hand. We're talking about the way in which people are treated over something that they cannot change.

&gt; Gender can be changed, for crying out loud

Yes, that's why I didn't say that sex cannot be changed. I consciously omitted it here: ""because such things as race, sexuality etc. are intrinsic"", but perhaps I should have been clearer.

&gt; how one acts on their sexuality or race or what have you is a choice

We seem to be agreeing on some points and not on others. But on this point, the two are slightly different as one is 'on display' generally more than the other. What I mean is, unless you get surgery of some kind then you're going to be quite obviously one race of another.

&gt; She needs to be educated, not threatened with violence (which is what government action is).

I agree she needs to be educated, but I fail to see how state sanctioned punishment is violence.

&gt; I would be the first person to tell her to shut up or learn to speak civilly.

It's interesting to note that you think there was something wrong with what she said, either in what she said or the way she said it. The laws that are in place are an extension of this, I believe. I think in this case it is not what she said, but the way she said it, if that makes sense. By the way, to show which direction I'm coming from on this, [I agree with Peter Tatchell over this conflict a while ago.](http://www.petertatchell.net/free_speech/Free-speech-christian-preachers.htm)

In this case the lady in question could have pharsed her opinions in a rather different manner. Also, it's possible that if she is convicted, she may be forced to attend 'lessons' on the subject which would in essence educate her.

&gt; [British Transport Police said a woman, 34, had been arrested on suspicion of a racially-aggravated offence.](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-15923875)

I'm not sure that there is or was an incitement to violence, but I think her behaviour would still fall under the [racially-aggravated offences.](http://www.cps.gov.uk/news/fact_sheets/racially_aggravated_offences/)

That's just not true. 

He seems to want us to think that if the press is regulated and privacy is protected, we won't find out about corruption any more. That's rubbish. He compared press regulation to China and Iran - nice strawman.

We'll _always_ have a public interest defense - but unlike what he seems to think, that's not necessarily 'what the public are interested in'. So with privacy respected, journalists will still be able to expose corruption by public figures, because it's in the public interest. They won't be able to print photos of JK Rowling's kids on a beach, or Max Moseley's orgies, because that's not in the public interest.

Some of the best investigative journalism comes from TV (Panorama and others), and TV news has been heavily regulated for decades. It's simply not the case that having some enforced standards prevents journalists from doing their job.

Here is something that might be interesting: you slip on ice, and bang your knee. Hurts like hell. Subjective? Of course. No one else is feeling the pain.

But. If immediately after you were stuck in an fMRI scanner, your pain would be plainly visible on a screen (ACC lights up). Same happens with whoever is scanned after a physical trauma. So pain no longer subjective.

But. Same brain region lights up (along with other anterior regions) when people are screamed at, or insulted. So, demeaning behaviour is universally demeaning - we know that.

true,GreatZapper,null,null,"I am striking, and I am marching, and I am proud of it.

I've agonised for a week over my decision.  I have never struck before, never really contemplated it, and in fact I'm part of a teaching union which, despite balloting for strike action, does not *force* us to go on strike and leaves it up to us to make the decision.  But, looking at the big picture, plus today's announcement of a two-year maximum 1% rise once the two year pay freeze is up, I'm now firm in my decision.  

Most of all, I worry that what will add up to an 18% pay cut in real terms over four years if inflation stays at 5%, which doesn't include increased pension contributions which is effectively another pay cut on top, will solidly damage the profession by attracting fewer high-quality candidates into teaching.  And there's only one set of people who stand to lose by this - the students.

Students today have asked me if I am going on strike - they're aware of the bigger issues, especially the older ones.  And many of them have congratulated me on that, which has surprised me.  Obviously some are enjoying the extra day off, but there is a level of support that I did not expect.  From the parents, there's less, clearly, though there seems to be some amount of understanding and empathy.

(And, animorph, if you do work in a school and have contact with pupils I strongly, strongly urge you to join a union for your own protection.  You never know when someone might make a false or malicious allegation - it happens all the time - and if you don't have decent representation, you're screwed.)",0,1322598608,null,0,true,0,c33rpdw,t3_mtooz,t1_c33rpdw,t3_mtooz,1427947149,46,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,46

For me, he lacks the technique and pace/acceleration to do anything more than head balls. He struggles to keep up on the break and to beat his man with the ball at his feet. Further, his first touch is a let down almost every time and his passing ability is below average. These shortcomings then lead to the whole team struggling as ball after balls is launched downrange to carroll usually resulting in lost possession. 

When we play pass and move, our attack has bite, but with no finishing. I feel that in order to finish top 4 we cant have such a 1-dimensional player on the pitch who is unable to effectively contribute to our successful system. We need a real, well developed finisher to play ahead of suarez; one that can also contribute to build up. 

We simply dont have time this season to see if he becomes the player we need. This is one of the tightest seasons in recent memory, we need to be clinical.

He has a good game once in awhile which means he must have some talent, but I say loan him out to the chamionship and let him develop while we sign a matchwinner for the first team in January.

A few of my colleagues are choosing not to strike, for various reasons from ideological to financial (eg one is pregnant and moving house so can't afford to).  Part of me really wants to go in, have an ""easy"" paperwork day and earn the money.  But the other part of me is convinced that this time, for the first time in 15 years, it's time to stand up and be counted and add my voice to the collective voice to say enough is enough.

The strike really isn't about party politics, about the labour movement vs the old-school conservatives, about the 99% - as much as I'd like it to be.  What it is about is showing our disquiet at the number of crazy changes going on in education right now, not just pensions, from free schools (where teachers don't need a teaching qualification to teach!) to privatisation via the back door (academies) to re-establishment of the old elitist systems (abolition of the completely sensible vocational qualifications route). 

I'll be honest and say there is, of course, some self-interest here.  But I'm not convinced my ""gold-plated"" pension is actually that (I'll be lucky to clear £12,000 a year when I finally retire at 68) either, especially now as I'll be paying in significantly more than I was and receiving significantly less.  And this is in a system which, shortly before the coalition government came in, was declared by an independent study completely sustainable and affordable for the next fifty years.  Suddenly, the goalposts have been shifted massively and we're expected to suck it up.  It's plain unfair.

But - if you demotivate the workforce, if you demonise teachers and portray them as being greedy and militant, you're only going to achieve one thing: teacher morale will drop through the floor, professionals will start to go through the motions and student outcomes will inevitably suffer.  That's what's so short sighted about all this.  Keep us happy, or at least motivated, and we will continue to do our damndest to make sure the young people in our care will succeed and achieve.  And, if our morale is low, then of course we will continue to try to do exactly the same thing - but you can't then deny that something, somewhere will start to have to give.  And when (not if - this isn't a threat, it's human nature) that happens - students. will. suffer.

(rant over.  Animorph, there are so many benefits to joining a union which a quick Google will show you.

However, the unions have attempted to negotiate, repeatedly, with limited results.  The proposals put forward last week were really just a bargaining chip, a quick and cheap sop to the unions to try to influence public opinion to say ""look, we've tried to compromise, but the unions aren't playing ball"".  They are not really realistic or acceptable.

So, we have to make our voice heard.  That's what tomorrow is about.  To make our voices heard, we really have only a couple of choices:

a) a work to rule - ie, working our contracted 1265 hours annually and no more.  That would mean, effectively, no marking, meetings or (crucially) planning and preparation outside of school hours.  To me, in a school, where planning and preparation are absolutely key to student outcomes, that's unacceptable as absolutely the people who matter - the students - will *directly be negatively impacted* by those actions.  It's irresponsible.  Which means...

b) a 24 hour strike action, while equally horrible, will have a limited impact on learning.  It's unfortunate that parents will take the brunt of this, but ultimately schools are about education, not child-minding.  In striking, I am thinking of the bigger picture of protesting negative changes to education.  While I regret the inconvenience inevitably caused to parents, it is a minor headache compared to the sweeping changes taking place which have the potential to affect negatively the education (and therefore prospects) of their children.",0,1322601109,null,0,false,0,c33s645,t3_mtooz,t1_c33s645,t1_c33ruty,1427947375,24,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,24

Obviously this isn't true. I've worked in the public sector, then the private sector but supplying the public sector, then pure private sector. I've seen people on both sides vastly overpaid for what they do. I've also seen people vastly underpaid for what they do. I could pick powerful examples for both. A lot of the benefits of working in the public sector aren't there any more, especially if you're just joining. 

By far the biggest problem the public sector has is that people are getting jobs elsewhere. And the people that are doing that are the good people, the people who are capable of getting jobs elsewhere, the people who have skills in demand. A lot of the people who are left aren't of the highest quality. And this has been happening for years. When I first joined the public sector there was a conscious decision to deskill the workforce and a shift towards consultants and contractors. I saw people who were earning £35k a year leave the team and then rejoin the day after as a contractor on £700 A DAY. If you look at something like the MoD, they don't really higher any engineers or scientists anymore. The only professionals they hire are in the legal professions.

I would imagine that part of the brain also lights up in situations where a person would not feel pain, although perhaps with different overall patterns of activation in the brain as a whole. I don't think we are at the point yet of being able to quantify internal experience although I don't think it's impossible that we will reach that point.

&gt;Mantras certainly remove the need to think, evaluate or consider, don't they?

In general yes but this is a mantra I repeat because I have thought it through, and a large part of my reasoning is that if you really want to reduce the amount of bigotry in the world you don't do it by telling the bigots they aren't allowed to express their views, this generally just gives them more fuel for their arguments. Debating abhorrent views in the light of day seems more desirable to me and I really don't see a way you can tell people that they can't express some opinions in public without damaging that debate.

If there had been a way to focus their ire more effectively on the people who were responsible, they would've taken it - they want satisfaction from their bosses, not to piss off other workers.  

Of course, the government and media are doing their level best to spin this into a fight between the public and private sectors, but really, genuinely, it isn't; and if you fall for that divide and conquer rubbish you're a fool (see what's happening to the Unilever workers for example).  In previous times, they would've called a strike today and walked out either today or tomorrow, probably for considerably more than a single day, so strikes are far less disruptive (and less powerful as a consequence) than they once were.  It's going to be a minor headache for you at worst, whereas public sector workers are getting royally screwed, just as many private sector workers were before them, and the remainder who don't have powerful unions, lobby groups or importance to capital will be as a consequence, should their action fail.

An increase in the amount paid into pensions is just a pay cut in the end.

edit: My pensions will not be affected by this issue, I am not a member of the union so the information I have is incomplete but I have been led to believe that the unions at my workplace will be striking and that there will be a picket line.

**edit:** clearly I need to clarify things to stop people responding with the same comment as the last 3 people:

I don't hate civil servants I think they're positively lovely.

When I say they have a better pension deal than me I mean just that, not that I have a bad pension deal. I think I have a good pension deal in that I get any money at all. This is the first job I've had since leaving Uni 11 years ago that actually contributed towards my pension.

When I say I don't have too much sympathy for them I mean just that ""too much"". Of course I have some sympathy for them, they're already lower paid than the private sector so of course it must hurt to receive what is basically a pay cut. However I'm quite happy with my pension deal which makes it hard to feel ""too much"" sympathy for people who have a much better deal than me.

Now for some downvotes.

true,DavidLuiz4,present,Didier Drogba,"I have some thoughts on today's game I'd like to share.

Today's lineup was a 442 with a diamond midfield. Malouda was fielded on the left of central midfield, Lampard on the right, McEachran at the Tip and Romeu mopping up. IMO, AVB was pretty much forced to alter the team shape from the usual 433 to accommodate the squad but maybe it was also just an experiment. 

What I think AVB's reasoning is this:

2 pts about our strikeforce

Lukaku, as you could probably see today, isn't experienced enough to lead the line alone yet. He's clearly extremely strong and great at using his body but looked confused as to what he should be doing and where he should be laying the ball off to.

Drogba is first choice for now and Torres needed game time, so it would make sense to field Lukaku + Torres together with the pressure reduced on both.

3 pts about our midfield

In the center, we're definitely playing McEachran in CC, but he's probably not physically ready yet to play 442 in the middle. That's just too much responsibility for a teenager against what is nearly a full strength Liverpool side who likes to pack the middle and and presses really hard with lots of ""runners""

IMO AVB will try to play Lampard less and less, and this game was a good excuse to not play him against Newcastle. I love Lamps, but he moves the ball slowly and isn't quite quick enough for pressing high up the pitch.

We don't have any real/good wingers, so when you rest Mata and Sturridge, it's kind of hard to field a winning side in a 433. I don't think I've seen Malouda, Anelka, Kalou beat anyone on the wing for a long long time.

So if you add these things up, the diamond midfield kind of makes sense. You saw AVB revert back to 433 when Mata and Ramires came on since he no longer had to accommodate McEachran and took off Lukaku who didn't have the best game.

1 pt about defense

It looked like Bertrand was OOP for the goal, but it's as a result of Luiz marking so tightly and getting drawn up the pitch a lot. This is his personal playing style which may need to change a bit at some point. Bertrands basically stuck watching an enormous amount of space by himself and gets caught out. Part of the reason out defence is bad this season is the combination of the high line AND Luiz and Terry's aggressiveness. I don't think there's a problem with the high line itself but rather that Luiz and Terry are not a good CB combo or at least have no chemistry yet. They need a more intelligent covering CB like Carvalho.

conclusion:

This game didn't really matter and the changes to the team's formation won't really reflect our results in the league since it's a one off to accommodate certain youth players. BUT I think it shows that we do need a different type of centerback in the squad who can cover for Luiz or Terry as well as some more quality out wide.

---

I have some thoughts on today's game I'd like to share.


Today's lineup was a 442 with a diamond midfield. Malouda was fielded on the left of central midfield, Lampard on the right, McEachran at the Tip and Romeu mopping up. IMO, AVB was pretty much forced to alter the team shape from the usual 433 to accommodate the squad but maybe it was also just an experiment.


What I think AVB's reasoning is this:


2 pts about our strikeforce


Lukaku, as you could probably see today, isn't experienced enough to lead the line alone yet. He's clearly extremely strong and great at using his body but looked confused as to what he should be doing and where he should be laying the ball off to.


Drogba is first choice for now and Torres needed game time, so it would make sense to field Lukaku + Torres together with the pressure reduced on both.


3 pts about our midfield


In the center, we're definitely playing McEachran in CC, but he's probably not physically ready yet to play 442 in the middle. That's just too much responsibility for a teenager against what is nearly a full strength Liverpool side who likes to pack the middle and and presses really hard with lots of ""runners""


IMO AVB will try to play Lampard less and less, and this game was a good excuse to not play him against Newcastle. I love Lamps, but he moves the ball slowly and isn't quite quick enough for pressing high up the pitch.


We don't have any real/good wingers, so when you rest Mata and Sturridge, it's kind of hard to field a winning side in a 433. I don't think I've seen Malouda, Anelka, Kalou beat anyone on the wing for a long long time.


So if you add these things up, the diamond midfield kind of makes sense. You saw AVB revert back to 433 when Mata and Ramires came on since he no longer had to accommodate McEachran and took off Lukaku who didn't have the best game.


1 pt about defense


It looked like Bertrand was OOP for the goal, but it's as a result of Luiz marking so tightly and getting drawn up the pitch a lot. This is his personal playing style which may need to change a bit at some point. Bertrands basically stuck watching an enormous amount of space by himself and gets caught out. Part of the reason out defence is bad this season is the combination of the high line AND Luiz and Terry's aggressiveness. I don't think there's a problem with the high line itself but rather that Luiz and Terry are not a good CB combo or at least have no chemistry yet. They need a more intelligent covering CB like Carvalho.


conclusion:


This game didn't really matter and the changes to the team's formation won't really reflect our results in the league since it's a one off to accommodate certain youth players. BUT I think it shows that we do need a different type of centerback in the squad who can cover for Luiz or Terry as well as some more quality out wide. You can blame Torres or whoever but there was absolutely no invention in midfield today. I'm sure McEachran will be great in the future, but he didn't do much today. Basically, we need new blood, and it will happen in January so let's wait and see.",0,1322611584,null,0,false,0,c33ty96,t3_mtv5m,t1_c33ty96,t3_mtv5m,1427948270,2,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,2

Well I think the express distinctions are there (i.e. for race but not for height) because very few people are abused because of their excessive height.

I realise that's only one example, but I think it shows up why people could see the legislation working in one place and not others, even though it actually does. 

It is illegal to discriminate against someone of disability. So mistreating someone for being short, which is more likely than because someone is tall I think, could result in prosecution I believe.

I think it's because the differences between races, and the treatment of some in a race by another in a different race, is more pronounced than the treatment or differences within them. I would posit that that is true overall: racist incidents between white and black are more common and more pronounced than heightist incidents within either group.

Just had a quick google and turned up this (down the bottom): http://www.safeworkers.co.uk/job-interview-questions-should-not-be-asked.html

Interestingly it would appear that height also falls under race discrimination: http://www.eeoc.gov/policy/docs/race-color.html

It seems that even though some people would think discrimination on race etc. is different to other attributes, the state might not make the distinction.

With regards the workplace/public - I'm not sure there should be such distinction. Of course the point I think you're making is that when you're at work, you can't ""get away"" from the person being abusive. However, I'm not sure that the onus should be on the abused to leave, if that was what you're saying could happen?

People are not being forced in to being fucked up the arse. People have the option of changing jobs &amp; physically moving somewhere else. I can, and have done this, including moving across an ocean and back again.

The tories and bankers are not entirely to blame for the clusterfuck we're in just now. It's ever so slightly more complicated than that. You might like to include just about every other politician in the country. Also every person who over extended themselves with loans and mortgages they couldn't afford. I'm not being overly smug here, I have a fucking huge mortgage - but (so far) can afford it. I've also mitigated the potential impact by having a decent deposit on the place and buying in a decent area, that will hold value more than other areas of this city...

Student finances - not everyone should go to higher education. Basket weaving and media studies degrees are not for everyone, and certainly do not guarantee a job. Government putting an arbitrary number of, say, 50% of people should go to university is a complete nonsense. When you start doing that, then you can't do grants for higher education. Then you get called elitist. But then some people would be better served in a polytechnic / college / apprenticeship. Remember those? They were really good for a lot of people who could learn on the job, or do stuff that was more interesting and appropriate to them and what they wanted to do with their lives.

You are quite capable of checking the history books yourself regarding workers' rights in the private sector. In my experience, these days folk generally move job when they get fed up. Colleagues of mine at a previous place didn't have a pay rise in 6 or 7 years.

There is something wrong about that and we should really be looking at how as a nation we address that.

Thing is, in and around these negotiation with the unions, that debate wasn't really being had by either them or the government, a really poor show.

As far as I'm concerned, this isn't a private vs public issue. Those in the private sector have their own pension arrangements and they signed up for whatever they got. It is irrelevant whether or not theirs is better or worse, but I suspect a good deal of private sector workers would be pretty irate if their pension was suddenly adjusted down which it may yet be after this has passed over.

It just locks us all into the same downward spiral below the bootheel that began long before this, accentuated by poor government since Heath, since Thatcher, since Major, Blair and Brown.

This debate is just a follicle to be extracted to allow the full on receding of all public services towards the private sector, and one not at the whim of 'market forces' but at one to the privy of the select. 

Excessive top level pay in any sector is not acceptable, public or private, but the key word is excessive, much like the vitriol against the majority of those working in the Public Sector when the attacks on those who are undeserving in the Public Sector go unfocused and scattershot on an ideological whim or crusade.

&gt;**Our great tradition of tax avoidance**


&gt;As a former inspector of taxes I find it astonishing that Andreas Whittam Smith (23 November) can refer to tax dodging by the very rich as a ""hidden truth"".

&gt;Within a year of Lloyd George's 1909 Budget introducing a supertax for the super-rich, to pay for a pittance of a state pension for the nation's paupers, Chambers Magazine was offering its readers an article on income tax avoidance.

&gt;For the past century, Tory and Labour governments have avoided any real crackdown on tax dodgers. In 1959, a speaker in the Commons was bemoaning the ""humiliating and rather disgraceful experience year after year of trying to stop the ingenious types of tax avoidance"".

&gt;To which, when I was still a novice investigator, my old, experienced District Inspector responded: ""What likelihood of a solution when our masters, the very people framing the legislation, their friends and families, or their financial supporters, or the vested interests they represent, have infinitely more to gain from preserving the status quo which serves them all so well?""

&gt;There has been no end to the inventiveness of the specialist, and avoidance has evolved with a Darwinian elegance, as with predator and prey. Measure evokes counter-measure, check produces counter-check, and as fast as one loophole is closed another is found, often by the very men the Revenue has spent so much time and money training. It would be naive to expect the present Cabinet of millionaires to do anything effective. 

&gt;John O'Sullivan

&gt;Ludlow, Shropshire


&gt;There is another reason for the increasing inequality in our society apart from those already mentioned by Andreas Whittam Smith, and the trade unions must accept some responsibility for this. I refer to our obsession with the percentage pay rise. 

&gt;Every time such a pay rise is agreed , the gap between the poorly paid and the well-paid widens. People earning £200,000 and more justify a 5 per cent pay rise on the grounds that those earning £20,000 had 5 per cent. This is clearly unconscionable. 

&gt;As the rich pay the same as the poor for essential services, it is difficult to argue that, if the low-paid need an extra £80 per month to keep pace with the cost of living, the higher paid need so much more. It would help to stop the inequality gap widening if pay negotiations were based on, say, the average salary in a company or organisation and the agreed increase paid as a fixed sum to all employees.

This situation is crazy. Comparisons to the PIGS do not wash without a second bottle of propaganda to go with it. I don't trust or believe in Cameron/Osborne to be able to deal with it or the country without reserving themselves to the same interests that have resulted in this (we would have, had we run a surplus prior to the financial crash, have been in deficit because of the banking crisis). Clegg did an about turn on getting into coalition. Ed Balls is...suitable for something vicious that my mind will not allow me to contemplate in the typed word on here, whilst Ed Miliband is probably only good for future Aardman claymation films. 

NHS. Schools. Higher Education. The Financial Sector. PFI. So much more on top of this. 

So many poor (at best) decisions. And who are the first to suffer.
