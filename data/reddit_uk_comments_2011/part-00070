I suppose technically though as it is owned by BBC Worldwide it is a normal commercial station and does not get funding from the license fee.

Anyhoo I am not anti-BBC or license fee to a point but I am semi-hypocritical as I have not had a TV for over 10 years but love radio 4 (no I don't watch the iPlayer as I think it would be taking the piss) and to be perfectly honest if TV licensing had not spent the last 10 years causing me shit and hassle I would have bought a license just for radio 4 (hence hypocrisy but there is no radio license anymore) but when I heard and read Capita's press releases over their ""pursuit"" of non-license holders and having being on the receiving end of literature that is bordering on threatening I decided that even though I like the BBC I did not want to appear on a Capita spreadsheet in the ""win"" column or in effect support their tactics. For me, it is not a financial point but a moral point over ethical behavior.

Also as this is a legislated revenue collection I don't think it is appropriate for a private company to be making money from it.    Unless it has changed recently then you used to pay more by direct debit (added up) than an outright fee and when this was questioned on Feedback the TV licensing representative said that you were charged for the year and you paid more by direct debit as you were paying the interest on your whole year debt.

Bernard Cribbins and Clive Swift, however, were brilliant.

true,Philomathematics,hartnell,Hartnell,"First off, this is a **fantastic** question. To the OP: May your green anchors be bountiful through all of time and space, in everything that ever happened or ever will. Good on you, mate.

To answer the question, I think it really depends. Up front, I am perhaps the biggest anti-Rose/Doctor 'shipper that I know, and I've been trying to figure out for the longest time just what the Doctor likes (or even loves) about Rose specifically. Because he definitely loves humanity, that is in no way questionable. And he loves seeing people be the best they can be, extraordinary in any way. And the 10th Doctor is probably the most human incarnation of the Doctor. His love for humanity is most apparent in his tenure (of the new Who, at least; I'm not qualified to speak on Classic).

Rose is incredibly emblematic of humanity. She is perfectly ordinary and part of a demographic that would get overlooked easily. But the Doctor transforms her and makes her arguably a much better person. I personally think that Rose is really selfish and I dislike her a lot, but I also think that what the Doctor sees and loves in Rose is how incredibly *human* she is. As a survivor of the Time War, the 9th Doctor latches on to Rose as someone who can bring him back to humanity, and the 10th Doctor seems to view her as something of a personal savior, as indicated by his words to her at the end of season four.

That said, the 11th Doctor is a bit different; as someone else has noted, 9 and 10 have more similarity than 10 and 11, and 11 is much more alien, much more distant. Still an incredible humanist, but he does seem to take more delight in people who are inherently special, in my opinion. It's what attracts him to Amy, makes him respect Rory, and makes him much more intrigued by River than 10 was. 11 has little tolerance for people who are less than the best of humanity, and I don't think he would see Rose the same way that 10 saw her - his preference is much more in favor of companions who are interesting and just a bit self-sufficient on their own.

Of course, as I've said and re-said, I'm a big anti-Rose (though I'm trying to be as unbiased as possible), and 11 might just be my favorite Doctor. I'm not going on record officially as saying that, but I am most intrigued by him.

Now, the original question - could Rose still love the 11th Doctor? I think it depends on how shallow you think Rose is (very, in my case). At the end of season one, she insists that it's not the adventures and aliens and other planets that attracts her to the Doctor, it's that he shows a way of being a better person, of encouraging the best in people. Whether or not her actions substantiate her words I don't know,  but I do agree with her statement. And like I said, 11 has this same capacity for believing in people, but it comes out differently. He's more manipulative about it, like when he tricks Sophie into going to study monkeys or provokes Rory into punching him. Furthermore, I'm intrigued by rthrtylr's suggestion that 11 dislikes 10. I can't substantiate it, but it's interesting and I think that 11 is reacting against who he used to be a lot, both in his previous incarnations and (as indicated in the season finale) against who he's become in his present incarnation.

Could Rose love a Doctor like that? I think yes, but she would have problems with how 11 operates compared to 10. The quirks and the underlying core beliefs are still there, but to go from such a human point of view to such an alien one would be very jarring for her. I could easily see her insisting that ""her Doctor"" would never do such things, kind of like how River maintains that 10 is the Doctor, but not *her* Doctor.

So that's what I think.

**tl;dr: Rose might still love the 11th Doctor, but it would be different. And he may not even reciprocate. Also, because it bears repeating: To the OP: May your green anchors be bountiful through all of time and space, in everything that ever happened or ever will.

I don't see you point there. No where in the interview quote you gave did she say any of the things the Mail said. Her complaint that she didn't talk about challenging herself to get people in bed seems perfectly valid.

true,Lyme,troughton,Troughton,"I think that the experiences the Doctor has around the time of his death, especially in the 2005 series, have a massive effect on the personality that he regenerates into. 

For example, 8 supposedly is the Doctor that goes through the massive Time War. When he regenerates into 9, we see this reflected as 9 being somewhat bitter, PTSD-y, and generally the most angry Doctor we've seen. Then you take the transformation of 9 to 10 - a much lighter Doctor in terms of personality. He's not so quick to anger, sees much more good in the universe, and is generally a happier person. I think that that was due in large part to the influence of Rose. For example, I believe they said that they wanted to show her influence on him by having Tennant use an accent more similar to the one Billie Piper was using, and in Journey's End, 10 makes a comment about Rose having 'fixed' him. Which I always interpreted as being around her made him a better person than he was before.

Then when you take the change from 10 to 11... between Journey's End and the Eleventh Hour, some seriously unpleasant shit happens to the Doctor. He ends up very much alone, tries to mess with a fixed point in time (with some disastrous results), and well, look at what we learn about the Timelords behind the timelock. As a result, we get a new Doctor in 11 that retains some of 10's joy at the universe, but is heavily afflicted with guilt, regret, sadness.

Okay, that big long thing aside, I think that if Rose had been around for 10's regeneration into 11, we would likely have gotten a *completely* different Doctor than what we have now. It's kind of a 'the act of observation changes the thing you're observing' situation. I don't think you can really ask the question 'would she still love him as 11' because I think that he wouldn't have regenerated into the 11 we know.


Now, if for some reason, Rose was pulled out of the parallel universe and met the 11th Doctor after he regenerated, still preserving the timeline of her ending up in Bad Wolf Bay... I think she would probably try to love him, but the dynamic would be too different for it to work. He's a lot more emotionally distant/reserved as 11.

That's because both seem to have agreed that the current university admission system systematically disadvantages some students, and as a result is not successful at selecting the best intake.

There's also an obvious tweak that would improve the system, although would by no means make it perfect.

Given that, it doesn't seem rational to me to say that we should prefer the current system to the tweaked one.

I don't care who's at fault. I don't really care if we should blame universities, or indeed parents, failing schools, government, private schools, or attitudes - allocating blame game just isn't something I'm that interested in. All that strikes me as sensible to think about is what factors *cause* current issues, and what options are there for rectifying that. Changing attitudes is of course one - but no one actually has the power to bring about such massive societal change to any real extent (which doesn't mean we shouldn't try). And there are also very simple alternatives that would be efficacious.

Note, I've argued entirely on the grounds of getting the best students in. I haven't said anything about how universities should be representative, or any other such values we might want publicly funded institutions to favour or perpetuate, which also count for increasing intake. That's a strategic consideration, as private school apologists often claim 'oh, inequality in education is bad, but once we hit universities we should forget about that, and just admit the best, who just so happen to be the privately educated students. It would be wrong to engage in social engineering  (oh, and for some reason my sending my kids to private school is not social engineering....)'. That is often a bad faith argument, but it doesn't work even when one accepts the premise that the only desideratum in university admissions should be accepting the best students.",0,1320139438,null,0,false,0,c2w30y2,t3_luz4o,t1_c2w30y2,t1_c2w2y64,1427813155,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

&gt;A Royal Servant Was Murdered in 1873
&gt;
&gt;During a state visit in 1873, a servant who was supposed to be guarding the Shah of Persia’s bedroom in the Belgian Suite throughout the night was discovered asleep on duty. His master ordered him to be beaten. The bodyguards took the order so literally that the servant died of his injuries. Queen Victoria was informed that it was a natural death and, to save unnecessary paperwork and any potential embarrassment, his body was (allegedly) buried secretly in the dead of night, in a far corner of the palace gardens near Hyde Park Corner, where, it is claimed, no flowers have blossomed since.

It's a historical anachronism that is has never been codified, and while it's nice in a romantic way that it never has been, it means that there is almost no clarity on procedure in the public mind.

There are very important questions that do not have clear answers such as:

If Party A gains a clear majority of seat in the commons and Party B gains a clear majority of votes, who shoould the queen invite to form a government?

If the Lords blocks a key piece of government legislation, is the Prime Minister entitled to floor the lords with new peers in order to get the legislation passed?

If a party wins a clear majority of both seats and votes, but the leader of that party loses his seat who is invited to form a government?

In the above situation would it be permissible for the party leader to take a peerage and govern from the Lords?

What happens if the Monarch refuses to sign a piece of legislation? Is this situation altered in any way by a clear majority of the public opposing the bill and it not being in the governments's manifesto?

We express our deep concern that, according to official figures, the population of the UK is expected to reach 70 million within 20 years with two thirds of the increase due to immigration. While we recognise the benefits that properly controlled immigration could bring to our economy and society, this population increase, which is the equivalent of building seven cities the size of Birmingham, will have a huge impact both on our quality of life and on our public services yet the public has never been consulted. So we call on the government to take all necessary steps to get immigration down to a level that will stabilise our population as close to the present level as possible and, certainly, well below 70 million.""

Tevez is selfish, arrogant, and a cancer to any team he plays for. Also throw in Joorabchian and it makes matters even worse. Remember how much Aquilani's agent was infuriating us last summer? Multiply that x50 and you get Joorabchian.

I don't care how good he is. Would you want Ronaldo in our squad? Hell no. Tevez is no different. One thing I love about LFC is the integrity that this club represents, and Tevez would spit on that very ideal. He has no respect for anyone but Carlos Tevez.

true,daeedorian,null,null,"I agree completely. Frankly, I'm shocked that anyone could disagree. My biggest issue is that the series seems to have ceased taking advantage of its setting. The first season had a fascinating overlying theme involving the social class structure of the time and place. The second season has just been a series of melodramatic twists that could be applied to any characters in any setting to much the same effect.

It just seems as though the writers ran out of social comments to make and started writing cheap drama for the sake of drama.

The William/Daisy thing struck me as completely implausible for the era. In a time when noblewomen would marry men 30 years their senior purely in the name of stability, I don't buy that a cook's aid would be so completely hung up on her perception of chemistry or the lack thereof. It just doesn't make sense for the era. It was like they were trying to apply a 21st century sense of entitlement to a lower class girl in Edwardian England.

I remember when I first read [this](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/8769641/Downton-Abbey-is-sheer-fantasy-says-historian.html) article in which a historian said that Downton's historical depiction was ""sanitized"" and ""bullshit"", my first thought was sour grapes. 

After seeing more episodes of this season, I'm beginning to agree with that historian more and more. If you look for it, there is starting to be an ongoing theme glorifying the old system of caste-like classes. Especially in today's world of increasing class disparity and demonstrations meant to display the unsustainability of it, that strikes me as a pretty offensive position.

They originated what became known as the 'Doctor Who Movie' format. They'd show the half hour segments during the week at 6 or 7pm and then string all the episodes for a particular story together and show that on Saturday afternoons. Originally they'd just show the half hour episodes back to back but later would actually edit them together at the cliff hanger points so that you'd get to watch one long episode. A buddy of mine who was older said that they used to show the Pertwee episodes as well on one of the UHF channels in the early 70's (think he said WPHL Channel 17). 

It was off the air for years, then some of the Baker years were on BBC:A for a time back in the early 2000's. After that I found a PBS station in the area that was still showing it and was thrilled that they had the rights to the whole original series. Then six weeks after they started over from the beginning they announced that they would no longer be showing it. Came to find out that this was mandated by the BBC partly because they didn't want any 'brand confusion' between the old and new series which had just started up. Pissed me off no end.

They all have huge middle classes, they form the vast majority of the population and the government spends billions of pounds each year to keep them happy because they'd never win an election without the support of them.

Middle classes are much better educated and more clued into what is happening in their country and the world so before the Government could easily handle problems like crime, poverty and health by catering to the small middle and upper classes. With a larger middle class they have more people to cater too. Not just crime, poverty and health but education, the environment, defence, the arts and the most expensive thing...social security.

true,PhoBWanKenobi,mcgann,McGann,"You guys are trying to come up with a timey wimey reason when a character-driven one suffices.

Well, that's not entirely true. There's one timey wimey reason why he doesn't just blurt out that he's in an android: he doesn't want Amy and Rory to know that he doesn't really die at Lake Silencio. Remember that the ""fixed point"" isn't just the Tesselecta getting shot, but also the entire universe believing that the Doctor dies. And Amy and Rory don't find out until much later that he's not really dead--and when they ultimately do, they're told by River, and even she says that she probably shouldn't tell them. The Doctor doesn't seem to want them to know the truth.

So that's why he doesn't just shout it. As for the character-driven reasons, he needs to convince River to touch him. Earlier in the episode, he's angry with her, and tries to force her to kiss or hold hands and she pulls away. She loves him so much that she'd rather the whole universe collapse than lose him through death. Marrying her is a way to convince her that he loves her, too, that she's special (""now you're the woman who married me""). And because she believes that his whispering in her ear is part of this marriage ceremony (something that in her huge Doctor-crush, she's willing to go along with), it works to get her physically close enough to reveal the truth to her without telling Amy, Rory, Madame Kovarian, or anyone else. He already knows that he can't force her to kiss him--he tried. He has to persuade her, by trusting her and letting her know the truth.

I saw my tablet connect, thought ""it can't be that easy"", and I opened the browser, and sure enough, reddit, my go-to site, came up in no time.  At which time, I said, without thinking about it, ""Oh, look at you go, you sexy thing"".

I immediately disconnected from the phone, shut down the phone's network, renamed said network to ""Sexy"", re-started it, reconnected, and downloaded TARDIS themes for both phone and tablet (the larger tablet, of course, got the inside of the TARDIS, while the phone got the exterior).",0,1320174901,null,0,false,0,c2w6sg9,t3_lwmom,t1_c2w6sg9,t3_lwmom,1427815070,8,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,8

2. I've heard a lot of crap about his behavior, briefly remember reading something about him refusing to play or some shit..fuck that.
3. I do in some sickly way wanna see a closer view of his neck, but is it worth him putting on our shirt for that? lol. no.

But wtf united to city id be eyeing him in derbies seeing if hes making friends, fk that.

dont want.

true,ragewind,uk,,"because the whole article is about the man dieing and the cycle super high way. it imply's cycle high way and death go hand in hand.

it does NOT say the driver didn't look, was drunk, was speeding, had no license or training or that the cyclist, wasn't stopping at lights, didn't wear a helmet or didn't have light.

these would be real reasons for the death, which is regrettable and will be hell for his family but this ""news article"" is junk pure and simple.

&gt;he feared father-of-three Brian Dorling, 58, would ""end up as another statistic"" of the Mayor's scheme that encourages cyclists to ride on main roads.

this implys that its legal to ride on the pavement which its not and that the scheme made him do something unsafe as a result.

&gt;a painted blue lane that offers no physical protection to cyclists - that had been the subject of safety concerns.

again implying that its unsafe compared with normal legal use of a cycle on the road, if anything it advertises to all road users that cyclist use the road which highlights the risk to drivers. in reality this says that the course of the accident was even more incompetent.

from reading the article i would be inclined to think that the cyclist had great experience on the road with cycles and motorbikes and that its likely that the lorry driver pulled out without due care and has caused a death. 

this could have been used to highlight the risk of cycling and educate drivers to look out for a growing sector of road users and help try improving our standards instead it be came a cheap shot at boris and a cycle lane at the expense of a mans life.",0,1320179673,null,0,false,0,c2w7lu7,t3_lwmlk,t1_c2w7lu7,t1_c2w7eei,1427815450,8,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,8

Classic Who did fine without all the ""drama"" of companions, and you don't need romance for drama anyways. The flow of the show would get on fine- Donna was never a romantic interest for the Doctor. That's just 21st century tv kicking in.

true,LokianEule,mccoy,Time's Champion,"I think Doctor Who may fall into a pit trap of being accused of sexism by design for reasons similar to this.

After all, our main character is a heroic male genius that saves the world. Therefore if the main character is male, we need a female, lest we be accused of sexism for having an all male main cast. However, because the Doctor is supposed to be the genius scientist, the companions must of course be the more dumb ones who ask him questions. This ends up being the female companion of course, and thus Doctor Who is accused of having female characters who are only “pretty faces”.

Suppose we throw in a male companion. This companion also can’t be smarter than the Doctor, but he has to have some redeeming qualities, so he becomes the strong macho action man. Of course the role falls to our female to be the damsel in distress. Companied with being attractive, this is a pitfall waiting to happen. This is also the format that early classic Who fell into. Contrast it with the new model which consists a strong female lead and her useless boyfriend. When you think about it, Moffat has, especially in this last season has broken the new mould. Rory is becoming manly, wearing Roman outfits, blowing up Cyberships, etc. You might say he’s becoming the macho action man of the team. See how we get trapped in a loop? One way or another, Doctor Who is going to be accused of sexism for its cast.

Every time Americans do something like this, it feels kind of insulting. For instance, I was a big fan of the *Indian in the Cupboard* books when I was a kid, but when I saw the film (where they changed the protagonist into an American), I felt like they were saying ""English kids aren't cool enough to have adventures, don't you know that only happens in America?"" The same feeling, only much much worse, when I saw the film of *Matilda*.

We here in Britain (and pretty much everyone in the world) watch a lot of American TV shows and movies. We learn a lot about your politics, history and culture from your shows, even the ones that are a bit rubbish. It feels like the least Americans could do is take part in this cross-cultural exchange by watching some of our stuff too; it's not even like you have to read subtitles.

I know that technically, making a copy of something can't actually take away from the original, but I can't help feeling like something has been stolen. It's a kind of cultural imperialism - American culture is everywhere, often supplanting native culture (because it's cheaper to syndicate and dub American shows than to produce your own), and yet Americans seem to resist any influx of foreign cultural influences themselves, by doing things like this and Americanising anything they like the look of.

I am the last watcher, keeper of times,

Alone in my quest for now it so seems.

I steady the balance of the worlds' climes,

Protecting all kinds from villainous fiends.

I fly through the vortex, Creation's gate,

Through wild and fire t'ward what none knows.

I run not to seek but to hide from fate,

To evade and avoid my greatest foes.

I am the one who finds life within death,

Who wanders aloof across the bright stars,

Until some venture should take my last breath,

Your Gran is getting these calls because she probably gave money to a charity without ticking a box (thereby giving direct permission for her number to be sold to lots of other charities) or gave money to a scam putting her on a list of soft touches.

I think it was just the writers not knowing in advance when they wrote Silence In The Library that the Doctor would be changing models; for 'future screwdriver' they just futured up the screwdriver they had.

Still, like I said, the hand-me-down hypothesis works too; I just think it's more romantic if Future Doctor gave River *his* screwdriver (which, who knows, maybe he blew out/lost the green one and revamped Ten's for his own at some point).

Spinning out,

Hurtling 'round the Sun,

Until I realize,    

With a just a single jump,    
A push against a wall,    
A fall down the stairs,    
The gifting of a doll,    

That thousand mile per hour spin,    
That sixty-seven thousand mile per hour fall,

Unpleasant forms of banking are wrong in and of themselves, and those involved are wicked whatever their origins (ultimately, the small number of Jewish people involved are screwing over the vast majority of Jewish people globally, just as the small number of non-Jewish people involved are screwing over the vast majority of us non-Jews).

true,teetheyes,null,null,"I get what you're saying. Although when things are Americanized, they're usually meant to appeal to the average American. Americans want to see Americans, just like you, as a Britisher, want to see Britishers. Plenty of people watch BBC in The States, but the thing is that in America, American stuff is really dominating. If you want BBC TV, you usually have to pay extra. In entertainment it isn't arrogant to say America is one of, if not the, top of production in both quality and sheer quantity. One could say that is why cross-cultural exchange isn't so very apparent. However, I would say there are a lot of outside influences in America, being that America was founded on such. I think you're wrong in saying we ""resist any influx of foreign cultural influences"", one could site the huge anime fanbase, for one. I don't know a single person who isn't familiar with the premise of Naruto. Also, where I lived, for example, it was very obvious that without a basic knowledge of the Spanish language one would be, essentially, fucked. And 30 minutes north, every sign is in Korean.

What I'm saying is don't be so offended when America wants to please its American people by making American entertainment. No one got mad when Disney re-did The Little Mermaid or Alice In Wonderland to make them more appealing to kids. We're not taking the remakes, or American TV in general, and shoving it down your throat. It can't be helped if other people like it. It's a kind of cultural imperialism to keep others from doing remakes, and turning your nose before production even begins, really.

Also, believe me, it's pretty much a fact here that only cool stuff happens to English kids. The grass is always greener. Unless you have close-minded preconceived biases of the other grass, and thus can not see the slightest beauty or good in any other grass. No offense intended.

I understand. :P I think there's a good 50 or so of them and that's quite a lot.  

I can work out all those numbers for you. As it is, each sprite is exactly 4 px apart from each other, and easy enough to change. I worked off of Leko's set, so none of them are any wider than Leko's 4th Doctor, and all of them are either 24px high or shorter.

Let me make sure I get the formulas correctly: Sprite size is a rectangle, pixel height x width+ 3 on each side? I'm a bit unsure on how offset is calculated.

true,mishagale,null,null,"&gt;Although when things are Americanized, they're usually meant to appeal to the average American. Americans want to see Americans, just like you, as a Britisher, want to see Britishers.

But we rarely actually remake American shows with British actors (and when we do, they are as crap as most American remakes are.) For instance, *The Wire* is very popular over here, and has been on broadcast TV, not to mention lots of DVD sales. And let me tell you, even though I've been hearing American accents since I could toddle, I still find some of that show hard to understand (as in, I need subtitles), and there are a fair number of cultural references I don't understand. But absolutely no one in the UK would suggest remaking *The Wire* and setting it in Leeds.


&gt;In entertainment it isn't arrogant to say America is one of, if not the, top of production in both quality and sheer quantity.

I would dispute that (not the quantity part), but it's a matter of opinion. That's not to say there aren't some really fantastic American shows and movies.


&gt;one could site the huge anime fanbase, for one

Thing is, that's a cult community, however large, and very much not part of the mainstream. But pretty much everyone in the UK watches American TV and movies.


&gt;Also, where I lived, for example, it was very obvious that without a basic knowledge of the Spanish language one would be, essentially, fucked. And 30 minutes north, every sign is in Korean.

Those are for the Koreans and Hispanics that actually *live* in America. How many (non-immigrant) Americans actually watch Mexican or Korean TV or movies? Come to think of it, isn't Ugly Betty a remake of a a Mexican soap?


&gt;No one got mad when Disney re-did The Little Mermaid or Alice In Wonderland

Just me then?


&gt;It's a kind of cultural imperialism to keep others from doing remakes

The thing is (and this is basically the same argument you hear against George Lucas), especially with stuff from when I was growing up (e.g. Red Dwarf), I feel like a work belongs to its fans as well as its creators. The reason I got cross about the *Matilda* movie I mentioned earlier is that the book was a part of my childhood, and however irrational it may seem, I can't help but feel that Hollywood was *stealing a piece of my childhood* by making it into a crappy film. 

I realise that all this is just so much hot air, and not all of my argument is entirely rational, but I'm just trying to explain why news of remakes like this trigger an emotional response from the fans. And also remember that we live in a world dominated by America, politically, culturally and in most other ways. I think it may be hard for Americans to understand how that feels to people who don't live in the USA, but if you think about it it goes some way to explaining reactions like mine.

Yeah, your formula's right.  The way background positioning works (which is how CSS sprites are done) is by imagining that it's the image itself that's moving underneath the window (height and width) defined.

So, to move from the first sprite to the second, the *image* is moving to the *left*, which is why the values are negative.  ""0 0"" is when the top left pixel is aligned with the top left pixel of the view window.

Here's an abbreviated version of the comment I left: 

... it’s not just the slash that draws people in. The two male leads are actually very strong actors, comedically and dramatically speaking. They have some deeply stupid lines/CGI to contend with, but they make the slash happen with their earnestness and sincerity.

You touched upon this at the end, but I think it deserves elaboration: the female characters used to have potential for depth. For one thing, it appeared Morgana (and possibly Arthur) had feelings for one another. Finding out they are half-siblings would have had a much more interesting impact on both of them if the writers hadn’t completely dropped the continuity ball there. Morgana was also shown to be a fantastic rider and fighter in her own right, (and could compete with Arthur) which was another thing the writers ret-conned into oblivion.

Much has gone on in Gwen’s life since the beginning of this story as well. Clearly there is interesting backstory about her brother and family. With her father dead and her (estranged) brother back in her life, there must be conflict to explore. Conflict directly related to the main plots, involving the knights, etc. What about her blacksmithing career? How does she deal with losing Lancelot? What about her crush on Merlin? And most importantly, what about the only positive female-female relationship on the show? What insight does she have on Morgana? Shouldn’t she be invaluable on that front?

The lack of female characters that make any sense is part of the reason people ship Arthur/Merlin. As a woman of color myself, I wanted to like Gwen, but there’s nothing to like or dislike.

with jobserve (for example, as it's the largest), just create a cv on there and check back every day or more often if you want and see what you like, then apply.  Once the cv is up there, it's only a click to apply for a job.


As for working out of Parkway, it is a dead space area, but you can get to some of the shops at lunch, places near the MoD for example are only down the road.  The BIG drawback and I mean BIG is that the big insurance place up there means that at 4 and 5 the roads are solid coming out of the roundabout.  Some people have said that it can take half an hour to just get out of the car park.

If you have a car then consider places like Newport and Swindon as well because they are only 35-40 miles from the M32.

Ok, so this, to me, just sits in the ""anti-capitalism"" bullcrap. I mean, what the hell is anti-capitalisim anyway?


You want to go back to a barter system?


You want to take all the money, stick it in a big pot and divide it equally between everyone?


Oh no, people worked hard and got ahead, oh no someone got some breaks and managed to make millions. If you have a problem with that, get off your arse,  work hard, make the money, then give it to the poor.


As for things like selling off the NHS, the NHS is screwed. I worked there in the past and although the doctors and nurses are working incredibly hard, there's a shit load of middle management fucking up the whole thing.


My opinion is that the government should turn around to the best private medical company in the country and say


""This is how much we spend on the NHS, if you run it for this figure as a free service we'll give you tax breaks"" then agree that they get increasing tax breaks as service levels are reached.


Same goes for all core infrastructure.


Infact, while you're at it the ""4 years and then someone else can have a go"" approach to politics is fucking moronic too, all that ever happens is every 4 years we get a different bunch of people trying to make their mark and change things and blah blah blah.

OR, if the Doctor regenerated into a female, I could totally see him being overly enthusiastic about it and determined to finally try out tons of girl stuff and constantly getting it wrong in various ways. Could make for amusing comic relief, if they managed not to exaggerate it. :)

true,haywire,null,null,"&gt; Egh, get a fucking job already and contribute to society rather than leaching off whatever this that or the other you can.

I have a job which I enjoy, but if I was working 50 hour weeks for minimum wage, I'd start to really question whether there was any point contributing to a system that exploits people so badly. Why should people work for fuck all money when at the end of the day, it isn't society that is benefiting, it is a small percentage of people at the top. Why should Chinese and Indian workers (or even the bottom rung here) slave away the best years of their life (and often childhood) so CEOs over here can have vintage car collections and multiple mansions?

Why should people work jobs for less than a living wage? If they're so necessary to society, fucking pay them more. Perhaps companies should start respecting their employees rather than screwing them over (favouring contract over employment, firing based on accusations/by association, paying people a pittance, union busting, expecting unpaid overtime). We're not as bad as the US, but surely everything we can do to stop us becoming like that is a good thing?

&gt; Ok, so this, to me, just sits in the ""anti-capitalism"" bullcrap. I mean, what the hell is anti-capitalisim anyway?
You want to go back to a barter system?

It varies from person to person honestly. There's hard lines anarcho-communists or anarcho-syndicalists that want to abolish wealth, and then there's people who simply believe that the system as it stands gives people with money far too much power.

Money should be used for buying nice things and investing in others, not as a legal bargaining chip, a way to change legislation, or to destroy countries.

&gt; ""This is how much we spend on the NHS, if you run it for this figure as a free service we'll give you tax breaks"" then agree that they get increasing tax breaks as service levels are reached.

Except people assume that private companies are this magical entity that will always do stuff more efficiently. Sometimes, yes, sometimes, no. The NHS is too important to risk fucking up so someone can make a buck. A well run social system will always beat a well run private system, purely because the money is going straight back into solving the problem as opposed to being siphoned off into people's pockets.

There are serious issues within the civil service, yes, and I'd consider many of them to amount to corruption. However, careerism is a disease that infests any large organisation, so I think we'd be better off curing the NHS than bothering with a private company that's in it for the money.

&gt; Same goes for all core infrastructure.

Like our trains? Prisons? Oh dear. 

&gt; Infact, while you're at it the ""4 years and then someone else can have a go"" approach to politics is fucking moronic too, all that ever happens is every 4 years we get a different bunch of people trying to make their mark and change things and blah blah blah.
&gt; Same for the schoolyard backbenchers rabbling over snide comments made about either side, grow the fuck up, you're running the country.

Sounds like you have an issue with the way the country is run. Perhaps you should campaign, write your MP a letter, join a revolution or occupy! ;-)",0,1320260445,null,0,true,0,c2whoam,t3_lta57,t1_c2whoam,t1_c2wed0m,1427820265,4,false,brighton,t5_2qprp,4

Not really the same, the rest of Gone With The Wind is in the same style, same cinema-photography, same colour, same production.

To say however that if someone likes 2011 Doctor Who they would also like 1963 Doctor Who doesn't follow.

I think the OP is asking a irrelevant question - ""Should I watch it for fear of not liking it?""  I don't know, nor do I know if he should have toast for breakfast because he may not like that.  Watch it and decide for yourself.  If after 10 minutes of watching Bill Hartnell forget his lines he can decide himself.

I wonder why you're unemployed? Even I have 12 A*-C GCSEs or something like that and I spent the whole time dossing around. Hell, because all but 5 of my GCSEs were Cs I was even branded a ""failure""(Thanks Mum!). How you can end up with just three, or worse zero GCSEs is beyond me, you must literally be window licking stupid.

&gt;I've made 50 applications in six months, through Jobcentres, and on the internet. 

FIFTY?!?!?! FIFTY?! Well there is another reason. 50 a day and you might get some sympathy. The best way to get a job is treat unemployment like a job, sit down at your desk from 9-5 and be productive. Refine you CV, make applications, use eBooks study for industry certifications, ect.

&gt;Since graduating from Leicester in June, I've made about five-10 job applications a week. I must have done about 100 by now. I'm going for everything, really.

It applies to absolutely everything however. Any store where somebody serves a customer, they are expected to be polite (within reason, unless the customer escalates it for example). However bus drivers are the opposite, in that they treat everybody like dirt, no matter how polite you are to them. 

I had one call me ""fucking useless"" for not knowing the exact name of the rather obscure ticket (a ""Taysaver Super Saver"", what the fuck is that?) and the price off the top of my head. Sorry, but that is HIS responsibility. Similarly, if someone comes to McDonalds and asks for a Chicken Sandwich, the staff don't call him useless until he calls it a **Mc** Chicken Sandwich, do they? 

I realise you are not disagreeing with me, and this is a bit of a rant, but it royally pisses me off that they get away with it when everybody else is expected to put in the effort to be polite to customers. Interacting with customers is part of their job, if they aren't being polite, they aren't doing their job right.

Now I tried several times to get into classic. I tried Destiny of the Daleks, The Three Doctors, Inferno, it all failed. Dismally.

Until I watched Genesis of the Daleks! One of the most hailed stories of DW.

My suggestion? Watch the very first episode. Just the first episode of the first story (which is made of four 25 minute episodes). It's *An Unearthly Child*. THEN watch Genesis.

The first two Doctor's can be quite hard. Black and white, cheesy sound stages, missing and reconstructed, long, inconsistent episode lengths and a ton of Daleks. But man is it worth it. Of course it wouldn't be horrible if you skipped to the 3rd Doctor when color tv and modernization of direct kicks in.

If you want to do the first two Doctors, google up Adventures with the Wife in Space. It's hilarious commentary from a non-fan who starts classic from episode one.

If we revert to 4-4-2, with Andy Carroll up front, then I see Shelvey dropping to the bench, unless he matures into a more complete midfielder (which is completely possible).  ",0,1320276028,null,0,false,0,c2wk32d,t3_ly6cw,t1_c2wk32d,t3_ly6cw,1427821472,1,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1

true,bloodfyr,mcgann,McGann,"This scene, I felt, epitomized everything that bugged me about RTD's time at the helm of the show, specifically Rose's reappearance. Her leaving the show was a really emotional moment, one that resonated with the Doctor for a long time (the consequences of which really overshadowed Martha as a companion). She left in one of the most complete ways that a character can leave, short of dying. She's in a different universe. She's on the other side of a break in reality that cannot be crossed no matter what. The Doctor has lost a character that brought him back and saved him from the darkness he suffered through as a result of what he did in the Time War. He's better for having known her, but he's once again in an emotional hole for losing her and has to deal with the fact that he'll never see her again.

And then when she comes back, all of the emotional value of that departure is forever gone, replaced instead by cheesy fake ""warmth"" at suddenly ""ROSE IS BACK OMGOMGOMG!"" that can't hold a candle to the investment I had when she was gone. For good. Never coming back. Ever. What makes it worse is that the HOW of her return is never really adequately explained. She's seen skipping all over time and space in our dimension hunting down Ten, and violating what the Doctor said required the Time Lords to accomplish.

In addition to the above...the presence of all of these characters in the episode more than overshadows the return of one of the Doctor's oldest and most deadliest enemies. It flat out ruins it. Because there has to be screentime for the Doctor's shock at Rose and at Jack and at Martha all being there (and for Jackie's screaming. God, I hate that woman.) on top of all the narrative...there's not enough screen time for Davros to be anything but a Machiavellian Bond villain, sitting in a big chair and stroking his cat as the hero is dropped into a pool of sharks. I really felt that in this episode, his return was a really cheap move that did nothing more but add a sense of shock value to the episode (""HOLY SHIT ITS DAVROS!!!""). The villain could have been anyone, even someone made up for that episode, and the episode would have been exactly the same. 

As I think back to RTD's years and compare them to two years of Moffat...it really seems to me that RTD consistently forgoes genuine character advancement in favor of these happy, cheery, huggy and (as mishagale puts it so perfectly) self-congratulatory moments. I think its connected with his problems of scale. Each season finale got more and more grand and ridiculous until the whole of reality was threatened on almost a daily basis, and so each of RTD's moments of character happiness gets grander and more ridiculous until we have the sickeningly sweet scene in the picture above, where real character progress is avoided in favor of ""happy huggy"" moments.

Then she came back, and the cheese never ended. It all felt hollow, the entire two parter became more about Rose than anything else. I could deal with that, I really could, were it not for Donna.

Donna is a companion that served a purpose, she was the one that helped get 10 back on track. She was the first friend he had in oh so long (I don't think we saw a 'friend' for the Doctor since Romana II) and in my opinion she was fantastic. Yet, when she saved the day and later lost everything that the Doctor had given her, it felt like a footnote compared to Rose.

I look at that scene above, and I feel much the way I did at the end of the end of time. It isn't so much about the Doctor and his friends, as it is about RTD trying to say goodbye to the show. I certainly respect RTD's right to say goodbye, but I think he did it at too high a cost.

There is a very simple rule to remember, neither party wants to go to court or get bailiffs involved as it's just cost and effort for everyone.

You owe £1,400, even if you pay that off over three years the cost lost to inflation is tiny compared to the amount of work to recover it (and you never manage to get your internal costs properly accounted for).

You need to talk to a group like the CAB and show them you pay slips, your rent and your bank account. You need to show how much money you can reasonably afford to use to pay back each month.

Then get in touch with the council and be apologetic, the people at the other end are just like you. They don't earn a lot, they get crap all day and they're doing a useful job. Explain that you owe this money due to a beauracratic mess, they know all about that. Be clear that you are willing to repay you debt but you need a payment plan and offer 20% less than you can afford, when they negotiate go up to 10% less and only go to the full amount if you have to.

Try and keep the payment term under 18 months as that's a common limit, passed that point you normally have to get a supervisor involved.

Once you've got them to agree it send a letter confirming what was agreed plus 6 post dated cheques.

Let's take your argument to its logical conclusion, shall we? All students on subjects not directly related to employment are transferred to more suitable ones. Nobody studies history, sociology or pure maths. We make education simply another tool in the job market rather than an end in itself. So in addition to a massive academic shortfall in several key areas, we have a massive oversupply of engineers, lawyers and so on. So many of those formerly ""soft"" students are still unemployed, as there are only so many jobs to go around, and not only that but the lucky few who get jobs will have massively decreased wages due to the increased labour supply.

It's not to do with where you live, it's to do with your income. Rich people in Glasgow eat a 'more English diet' than poor people in Glasgow and it's got nothing to do with being English, Welsh or Scottish. 

They can't even directly prove beyond all doubt that diet has an effect, since it's so closely linked to income. It might be the same factors that lead to higher income lead to eating that way but also lead to better health. Is olive oil a super food? Because I bet you could link the amount of olive oil consumed to good health. What about sun dried tomato for the same thing. Perhaps shopping at Farmfoods is linked to heart disease...

The fact is there's more evidence to suggest that the lead character's full name is 'Doctor Who' than there is against it. At no point in the show has he flat-out said the words 'My name is *not* Doctor Who!'. However, we *have* had:

* The lead actors being referred to as 'Doctor Who/Dr. Who' in the credits sequence from 1963 to 1980 and in 2005.
* WOTAN in *The War Machines* directly calling the character 'Doctor Who' on a number of occasions.
* [This note](http://www.whoguide.com/images/aa/signature.jpg) from *The Underwater Menace*.
* The character introducing himself as 'Doktor von Wer' in *The Highlanders*.
* Bessie's [numberplate](http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4047/4650794419_4dd6750329.jpg) which changes to WHO 7 in the McCoy era's *Battlefield*. 
* The episode titles *The Death of Doctor Who* and* Doctor Who and the Silurians*.

The trauma of taking a child from the mother is probably greater for the mother than it is for the father. Not that it isn't traumatic at all for the dad, just not *as* traumatic.

If the mother is a demonstrable danger to the child then there are laws in place to make sure the father gets custody. Most of the time, this simply isn't the case.

That sent a clear market signal to all institutions that had overexposed themselves to bad debt; don't worry, you can continue to take huge risks, because the taxpayer will eat the losses, while you get to keep any profits you can make this way.

It would have been better for the free market to let the banks go under; save average depositors (but *not* the investors, nor people who put large amounts into any one bank) by allowing you to move the first £50,000 of deposits from a failed bank to a working bank, and letting the bankruptcy administrators sell off the remaining assets (including loans) at a market price.

This would have involved a rules change - the [FSCS](http://www.fscs.org.uk/) would have had to have been altered quickly to cover the entire £50,000, not just 90% of it (that change has since been made, along with an increase to £85,000 limit instead of £50,000).

It would protect the majority of depositors (people who have a bank account for their day-to-day spending), and protect people whose savings were small enough that looking into bank risk wasn't a sensible use of time. 

Anyone who's investing in a bank should be doing their own due diligence over the risk, and is in a position to sell out or push to get management changed to people who get the risk under control.

Last time I looked children coming from single parent household (in particular boys) are significantly more likely to have a run-in with the police and or get convicted of a crime.

Plus men are ALWAYS being challenged when they go near children. Our society practically makes a hobby of it. Men in child care? Men in schools? Men even coaching a kid?    

Fact is a mother has to be shown to be a danger to the child. A father is assumed to be that way and has to prove he has a clean record and disprove slander.

We were taken to the station, I was treated very well because I was a ""witness"" but my friend was stripped, cavity searched, denied food nor water and denied contact with her parents.

After 2 hours in the interview room I managed to convince them Kay didn't do anything. And it turns out the house has a CCTV that they didn't tell the police about. We were both released without charge.

All this happened because we are teenagers, and an act of vandalism happened half a kilometre away. When we are treated like this, is it any wonder that some act like ""feral animals""?",0,1320311806,null,0,false,0,c2woiq7,t3_lyrx2,t1_c2woiq7,t3_lyrx2,1427823557,62,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,62

The truth is, the US does not have capitalism. Capitalism is about a free-market, and the US is far from a free market. It is highly regulated in the favor of corporate business, many of whom get government money.
&gt;
&gt;That is welfarism.

The reason a lot of the confusion has arisen is that the left, who originally defined capitalism by the way, used the term by way of a critique of the mercantilist beast that arose from feudalism to which both Adam Smith and Marx in their different ways were opposed, but then elements of the right adopted it as a badge of honour.  Since then, the term has been redefined endlessly and confusingly on more and less free market bases, whilst the left pretty much gave up on libertarianism (following either classical Marx or Statist models of social democratic capitalism).  There's been something of a rebirth of libertarian socialism in recent times.

We can tie ourselves in knots with the semantics but basically the majority of both left and right agree that this system that we have currently, whether you want to call it capitalism, corporate capitalism, corporatism, welfarism, welfare capitalism, unfree-market capitalism, or whatever, is problematic.

I also know how this feels. I was at school during the eighties when public services were sold off the highest bidder. Money was everywhere, everyone was rolling in it (See Harry Enfield's Character of the time 'Loads a Money!') I then left school in the early nineties right in the middle of the inevitable bust / recession that followed the binge. Unemployment a lot higher then we have now and just as many shitty things happening in the world too. I had to work for a money grabbing middle man temp agency cleaning hospitals during the day and stacking shelf's in Sainbury's over night. I was a 17 year old pushing a mop around listening to orbital on a 'walkman' with my colleague who was a 64 year old granny who smoked old holborn. I had to share a house with a load of others and having a flat was unrealistic at the time. Riots were everywhere and everyone felt deflated and anxious. It was tough and I had to put my neck out everyday to get something better. Assuming it was easier back then is a mistaken perspective. The seventies were even harder, sixties more so and on.

Now I don't say all of this as I believe you should shut and put up. I am just as angry about the greed that is wrecking not just this country, but the world and you should  demand better...but don't just lump a whole generation of people into the same ilk.

If I was working 50 hours a week earning minimum wage, I'd be looking for another job, or ways of educating myself better so that I can find a better job. Any one that argues that I'd point them at the financial director where I work who started out as a cleaner whilst looking after a family member and putting him self through a number of accounting courses (earning minimum wage, plus 40 hour weeks, plus learning, plus caring for a family member).


Issues in places like India and china are heavily down to over population which is a whole other matter that people would hate me for my opinions on.


Communism doesn't work once you get over 15 or so people, it certainly won't work when you hit millions of people unless you have a strong military as Russia\Cuba\etc have proved.


&gt; Money should be used for buying nice things and investing in others, not as a legal bargaining chip, a way to change legislation, or to destroy countries.


I don't even follow what you mean by that statement. If we're paying people with currency and we have laws then we (unfortunately) need lawyers and if we have people that know the law inside out then they're going to be looking for ways to use that law to benefit them selves so they have the most about of money for buying nice things and investing.


It's more an attitude thing than an issue with the system; people are greedy and mostly lazy.


Do you know anything about BUPA? my understanding is that all their profits go back into making BUPA run better, correct me if I'm wrong.


Besides, that's not what I said, I'm not saying we should sell the NHS to a company that makes it into a money producing company. You offer whoever runs it massive tax breaks based on how well the NHS performs.


Imagine BUPA take over the NHS and they get queue times down to 45min, people leave the NHS cured of their ills, the costs to run it are cut by 25% and people sing it's praises as a free service then BUPA would get a x% tax deduction.

BUPA would still run it's own company as a private paid service where people would get a better quality of service but the incentive for them to run the NHS better is there so they can make more profit to run their own service better.


My point is, surely someone that knows about running a medical service is in better stead to run one that someone who isn't. Same goes for education, rather than having a reporter as the top educational MP maybe the most successful headmaster would make more sense. You know, pick the people who have climbed to the top of their chosen field and have them run that sector of government.


So, yes, our trains, telecoms, fuel providers etc as base infrastructure should be run by central entities rather than the clusterfuck that is the current rail network ""we just run the trains, the track's not our problem"" etc.


&gt; Sounds like you have an issue with the way the country is run. Perhaps you should campaign, write your MP a letter, join a revolution or occupy! ;-)

There seems to be this weird thread running through Mail articles and Sun commentators that goes ""There is only one right way, only one type of music, only one type of existence - all others and evil and must be crushed.  If you see a kid wearing a hoody and listening to grime music then either avoid him or kill him, these are your only options.""  In my mind it's pretty clear that if you go around with an attitude like that you're going to impose your assumptions on every interaction, how is someone, certainly a youth, going to respond to someone that's so obviously looking down on them from the start?  someone so obviously closed to anything they have to say?  
  
A lot of my friends are the people who get called 'feral' in the Mail, they're great people and a fuck of a lot more trustworthy than a lot of my more 'righteous' friends.

At the moment a lot of people don't want anything to do with society because society doesn't want anything to do with them, sure this has always been thus (- although actually it hasn't) but in recent years the hate is more pronounced,  
  
Half the people likely read this question as 'should we gas chavs' and voted a resounding yes; certainly they couldn't actually mean to answer literally - people call them good for nothing scrotes and all sorts of idiotic insults, then wonder why 'the chavs' aren't tripping over themselves to be nice to to them!  Heck, i'd probably knife Richard Littlejohn if i met him - i'd be ashamed of letting myself down over such a worthless prick but still, the heat of the moment - his face....

(probably most of them, the reactionaries and the free thinkers) - This petty hatred of mildly different things isn't just petty, it's socially divisive - it's the reason that 'kids' are interested in being part of society, society doesn't want them *them* it want's them to change; it want's them to give up themselves.

Give 'em a few more years of interaction with mature adults and positive role models and they'll learn how to behave like adults and become valuable members of society.  But if we, as a society, try to marginalise them and keep them out of sight and sound of adults then there's the danger that they'll never learn.

That said, there's a small percentage of kids/young adults who are just mindless thugs and will probably never change their ways.  I would hazard a guess to say that the vast majority come from broken homes and have grown up without a permanent father figure acting as a positive role model.  But that's a deep rabbit hole that I don't want to go down...

You're lucky.  You could have gone to a right shit hole of a school and been dragged down with it.

I didn't go to University for two reasons.  I wasn't sure if I wanted too and in turn couldn't take the risk of getting loans to pay for it.

Actually I did read them, but as I said they didn't address my argument. They just talk about stimulating the introduction of renewables. I'm fully supportive of this goal, I just think that Feed in Tariffs are an unfair way of doing it. You could take any mention of FiTs out of these articles and replace them with some other system of subsidy and it wouldn't change anything in the article, people would still be happy that it is boosting renewable energy.

Thanks for the additional links that in no way relate to my argument.

Tom Baker (4th) for nostalgia (he was the Doctor I grew up with) and the big goofy grin.

William Hartnell (1st) for being first!  Well before my time, but he had a few great moments as a dusty old crank.

Christopher Eccleston (9th) for bringing the part back to life with such contagious enthusiasm.  Sadly, he was saddled with a few stinker stories and his character had to do some not-so-credible emotional swings.  For the latter, I'm not sure how much is the fault of the writers, directors, or the actor himself.

Matt Smith (11th) for being so amazingly old/young, wise/foolish, serious/fun.  He jumps around through all those things but it seems so natural, not like he's some nutter with multiple personalities.  He may very well be the best actor yet to portray the Doctor.

true,The3rdWorld,eng-essex,Essex,"probably the fridge, is it economical? turned up too high [low]?  
  
the cost of power is either 28p or 15p (depending on tier) per kW/h in the day and 6.9p at night.  
  
12x28=336; so if you have devices on using a 1000W of power for 12 hours it'll cost three pounds thirty six.  [this page](http://techreviewer.com/viewpage.cfm/ui/040226130555) measured computer draw on standby at 0.4A although a more modern power saving device should be more economical, [This](http://www.cnet.com.au/power-consumption-how-much-are-your-gadgets-costing-you-339295690.htm) article suggests a windows Pc uses 0.34 when *operating*.  
  
Assuming these are Americas using 120v that means they're drawing around 60W per hour or 0.06kW - which seems to agree with [this](http://michaelbluejay.com/electricity/computers.html) old site talking about power consumption.

It seems that a computer should cost somewhere between twenty pence and at most a pound when run for twelve hours, assuming she got a power saving computer and her interpretation of most the time is a little less than ours i can see this making sense.  
  
A Fridge freezer typically uses about 250kw/h a year - which is about half a kW/h a day.  
  
oh and things like phone charges left plugged in but not connected to a phone can radiate surprising amounts of waste energy; other little things that convert the 240v to 12v or there about tend to waste huge amounts when not switched on too, do you leave things on standby?

Discarding for a moment the possibility that Liz Jones is a marvelous work of satire by an undercover liberal journalist determined to make the Daily Mail become a parody of itself and disappear up between it's own tightly clenched buttocks.

&gt;The ‘theft’ itself was alarmingly easy to carry out. One night, after sex, I took the used condom and, in the privacy of the bathroom, I did what I had to do. Bingo.

&gt;I don’t understand why more men aren’t wise to this risk — maybe sex addles their brain. 

Well, Liz, maybe my sex-addled brain just isn't firing on all cylinders, or maybe I just find it hard to fathom that many women could be as selfish, duplicitous or, quite frankly, criminally insane as you make out. Men aren't stupid, we understand that there is a risk of falling prey to a sperm thief in the same way that we understand there is a risk of being violently stabbed to death should we stop to ask a stranger for the time of day.

It's not enough that the Daily Mail tries it's damned best to make people feel uncomfortable with immigrants, doctors, science, foreigners, technology and the outside world in general - now it tries to turn us in on ourselves, against each other, our loved ones. The process of being in a relationship and having a child with someone you love is now supposedly a minefield, fraught with backstabbing, danger, lying and surreptitious spermjackings?

This is without even getting into the consequences for a child brought into the world via subterfuge to be a dumping ground for misplaced resentment and suffocating affections.

I think it is wise at this point to remember that such a terrible woman is in no way representative of her gender as a whole.

true,DogBotherer,null,null,"It really does depend [which of these basic systems you're calling capitalism](http://bleedingheartlibertarians.com/2011/08/libertarian-anticapitalism/):


* Free Enterprise. This is a relatively new usage (coming mainly from libertarian writing in the 1920s-1940s). “Capitalism” has been used by its defenders just to mean a free market or free enterprise system, i.e., an economic order — any economic order — that emerges from voluntary exchanges of property and labor without government intervention (or any other form of systemic coercion). This is the meaning that is almost surely most familiar to those who spend much time reading libertarian economic writing; it is offered as, more or less, a stipulative definition of the term in Friedman, Mises, et al.

* Pro-Business Political Economy. “Capitalism” has also been used, sometimes by its opponents, and sometimes by beneficiaries of the system, to mean a corporatist or pro-business economic policy — that is, to active government support for big businesses through instruments such as government-granted monopolies, subsidies, central banking, tax-funded infrastructure, “development” grants and loans, Kelo-style for-profit eminent domain, bail-outs, etc. Thus, when a progressive like Naomi Klein describes government-hired mercenaries, paramilitary torture squads or multigovernment financial institutions like the IMF and World Bank, as examples of the political economy of “disaster capitalism,” capitalism here must mean something other than markets left free of major government intervention. Rather, this is the state intervening, with a very heavy hand, to promote the interests of a particular class of economic players, or promoting a particular form of economic activity, as a matter of policy. This second meaning of capitalism is, of course, mutually exclusive with the first meaning — state-driven corporatism necessarily consists of projects funded by expropriated tax dollars, or regulations enforced from the barrel of a gun, and so to be a “capitalist” in the sense of a free marketeer means being an “anti-capitalist” in the sense of opposing the corporate state, and being “pro-capitalist” in the sense of state “growth” policy means coming out against “capitalism” in the sense of genuinely free markets.

* The Wage-Labor System. “Capitalism” has also been used to refer to a specific form of labor market, or a distinctive pattern of conditions facing ordinary working people — one in which the predominant form of economic activity is the production of goods or the performance of services in workplaces that are owned and managed, not by the people doing the work on the line, but by an outside boss. In this third sense, you have capitalism when most workers are working for someone else, in return for a wage, because access to most of the important factors of production is mediated through a business class, with the businessmen and not the workers holding legal titles to the business, the tools and facilities that make the shop run, and the residual profits that accrue to the business.  Workplaces are, as a result, typically organized in hierarchical fashion, with a boss exercising a great deal of discretion over employees, who are generally much more dependent on keeping the job than the boss is on keeping any one worker. (This sense is most commonly seen in Marxian writing, and in older writing from the radical Left — including a great deal of pro-market writing from Anarchists such as Benjamin Tucker and Pierre-Joseph Proudhon.)

* Profit-Dominated Society. Finally, the term “capitalism” is very often used (outside of the debating circles of libertarian economists, this is in fact probably the modal use of the term) loosely to mean something like the commercialization of everyday life — that is, a condition in which social interactions are very largely mediated through, or reshaped by, overtly commercial motives, and most or all important social and economic institutions are run primarily on a businesslike, for-profit basis.",0,1320338373,null,0,false,0,c2wr7qc,t3_ly4d3,t1_c2wr7qc,t1_c2wqtm7,1427824843,5,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,5

I've noticed this in recent games (well in the Arsenal and Genk games), I think Torres's biggest problem is his teammates.

In other words, I think his teammates have lost confidence in him, this applies to the attacking players in general but ot Sturridge in particular.  I genuinely can't recall a pass made to Torres in an advanced position during the Genk game.  and his frustration was becoming palpable, forcing him to drop deeper and pick up the ball only when he was surrounded by heavy traffic.  Which ofcourse meant he would lose it almost instaneously and only further decrease the confidence his teammates have in him.

In contrast, during the first Genk game, his teammates were passing the ball to him right outside the pnealty box.  I think his biggest problem is the loss of trust from his teammates.

Many banks have become too big to fail, that's the main reason for the bail outs.  I doubt the same would have happened if a group of small banks alone were hit by toxic assets.

&gt;That sent a clear market signal to all institutions that had overexposed themselves to bad debt; don't worry, you can continue to take huge risks, because the taxpayer will eat the losses, while you get to keep any profits you can make this way.

The can't-lose, take-as-much-risk-as-possible attitude was predominant before the credit crunch.  Besides, some banks were nationalised.

Overall, I think I do agree about most of what you say.  Certain banks should have been allowed to fail and savers should have gotten up to £50k of their money back.

true,lightsaberon,null,null,"&gt;What regulations were removed that caused the current situation?

Glass-Stegals is one important one, which many economists now consider to have been pivotal for the sub-prime mortgages.  Other ones are equity capital to cover losses.  Limited liability is another one.  Consolidation allowed banks to become too big to fail.  Dropping regulations involving mergers, especially between regular banks, investment banks and insurance companies.  Banks allowed to deduct interest payments from tax liabilities.  

&gt;Besides, merely deregulating has nothing to do with free market capitalism per se. It's especially hard for the system to police itself when regulations build up and protect giant institutions and then bails them out when they mess up (Thus making every risk not a risk).

Actually it does.  The whole point of free market capitalism is that the government doesn't interfere with the market, otherwise it's not free.  That's why it's called *free* market capitalism.  Regulations don't protect giant institutions or bail out anything.  A regulation is basically a law, in this context it applies to businesses.  There is no law that says giant institutions must be protected or bailed out.

&gt;What I meant by caught up is probably more accurately explained as the West is no longer rapidly out-growing the rest, which it did during the 1800s after the Western nations became increasingly free market and capitalist. e.g. See this, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_GDP_(real)_growth_rate

That's a ridiculous definition.  If a poor man doubles his income, how has he caught up to a millionaire in any meaningful way, even if the millionaire only raised his income by 49%?

&gt;The countries who are growing the most tend to be the ones who are becoming more free market capitalist.

That's a vague and dishonest way to put it.  A country may have less crime if it becomes a bit more authoritarian, that doesn't mean that an authoritarian country has no crime though.  A little of something can be a good thing, too much of it could kill you though.",0,1320344988,null,0,false,0,c2wsd36,t3_lxxmu,t1_c2wsd36,t1_c2woahs,1427825481,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

There are some areas to steer clear of but they are easily enough to avoid, particularly if you ask anyone local who can tell you where they are - again compared to some cities of a similar size even the bad areas aren't quite so bad, and are fewer in quantity.

The too-big-to-fail concept is hardly new, or complex.  It just means that some corporations hold so much equity/money/investments that their bankruptcy would have a detrimental impact on the entire market.  It's like a giant falling down, the villagers get crushed.

Let's say a very large bank that holds billions of dollars of assets falls.  We then say fuck it, let the market deal with it.  All of a sudden billions of dollars of investment hit the market for sale in a matter of days.  There's also a fear of yet more of this happening.  More banks may collapse, further billions may be dumped onto the market.  The flood of these investments makes their prices tumble.  The investments are varied, everything from major tech and water companies to Bob's farm gets hit.  Companies all over see a fall in the value of their businesses.  How many investors are going to grab dumped investments at such a time, when prices are falling and it's likely they'll keep falling?  Never catch a falling knife is one popular mantra of investors.  Other investment companies and banks also take a big hit.  Savers are hit too, pensions get hit.  The snowball eventually becomes an avalanche.  And it gets worse, this bank is a major international bank, so it hits other economies as well...

If there's any way you can shut down a couple of rads try that &amp; see if it helps. Good dry hardwoods - ideally felled a couple of years ago - are best, although ash is pretty good when fresh.

1) Indeed.co.uk 
Set up an email alert with criteria you are looking for. I set up a few with overlapping criteria or different words for the work I was looking for. You get an email a day, but sometimes their sweep is a little late and the jobs are already stale on arrival.

2) Reed.co.uk
I signed up for this but didn't really get anything from it. I also signed up with them as a temp, which took half a day, and also didn't hear anything from it. YMMV I suppose.

3) Office Angels
Same as Reed.co.uk, but they have an office close to Reed's in the city centre.

4) Agencies
I wouldn't bother with these. They apparently work if you badger them relentlessly to find you work but that was never my style.

5) Jobsite.co.uk
This provided me with some very promising leads. The important thing to remember, though, is you need to upload your CV almost daily. It may just be paranoia but I swear I got better results and more calls when I uploaded my CV every day.

6) Leave no stone unturned.
Heck, by the end I was typing 'data entry jobs' (which I was looking for at the time) into Google to see if I got any joy. Which brings me to how I actually got my job...

After doing all of the above for almost a year I wound up with one job, which I got from pinging off a CV to the Cabot Circus website. It didn't really gel, and I had some illness during my probation, so I couldn't stick with it. Then one day I typed 'data entry jobs bristol' or something into Google, and found something that looked promising. So I sent my CV. 

Come Monday I gave the office a ring (because I wanted first dibs, obviously) and was told they hadn't even looked in their inbox at that time. I left my name as 'one to look out for' on their list. Next thing I know I was called in to sign up to their agency, started the job and got made permanent within three months. Now I work full time.

I suppose the moral of everything is this

The point I was making was that there is no one or even small combination of regulations that were repealed that clearly and directly caused the financial crisis, which could equally be blamed on regulations that do exist.

&gt;Actually it does. The whole point of free market capitalism is that the government doesn't interfere with the market, otherwise it's not free. 

**Merely** deregulating has nothing to do with free market capitalism **per se**.  Yes, a lack of regulation is essential for free market capitalism but the mere act of deregulating a bit doesn’t mean that the approach taken is a free market capitalist one.

For example the removal of *some* regulations while retaining or introducing others can further entrench giant corporations.

&gt;Regulations don't protect giant institutions or bail out anything. A regulation is basically a law, in this context it applies to businesses.  There is no law that says giant institutions must be protected or bailed out.

That's *all* regulations do, especially if we look at it from the perspective of your definition.  

Take for example patents, copyrights and trademarks; these are all regulations, laws that apply to business, and all they do is build up and protect giant institutions (Admittedly they occasionally allow a new player) while raising the barrier for entry, all regulations have this effect, that is why they exist.

So while regulations do not directly and explicitly build up and protect giant institutions the end result is nigh on identical, creating a situation where they are considered 'too big to fail' and resulting in being bailed out for failing.

&gt;If a poor man doubles his income, how has he caught up to a millionaire in any meaningful way, even if the millionaire only raised his income by 49%?

Because it's vastly more complicated than that hypothetical situation and isn't something that has happened for *one year*, it's been happening for *many, many years*.  Let us not forget that the West has been artificially raising and supporting its living standards on debt for decades.

which suggests to me that she actually thinks having it all *is* a privilege, regardless of her own previous behaviour.

And I also find this sad but true:

&gt;‘Well, it was joint, yes. I think so. You have to remember that no man will ever think he is ready for a family. Sometimes you have to push.’

I know of many women in their early thirties who are ditched by a similar-age partner in their mid thirties because he doesn't want to start a family and they do (and in fairness, it's ""now or never"" for them, biologically speaking).  More often than not, that guy then hooks up with a woman in her late twenties.  And then has a family.  I'm not sure what the lesson is here.  Perhaps it's for women to find significantly older partners.  Perhaps it's for them to ditch the man much earlier, if by their early thirties he's still family-averse.
