true,SoysauseJJ,silence,Silence,"Part One. Tardis takes 11 + companion(s) to a planet that has been destroyed by a time anomoly, the olanet being shattered and floating around in peices, however, it is exploding extremely slowly due to the time anomoly, to the point were it is stable enough for tou to walk around, and there is still a breathable atmosphere, etc. After walking around for a while, 11 + companion(s) find a ruined structure (temple or something else, has to be made of stone), which is slowly collapsing, with collumns falling and such, filled with statues and such things. Eventually, they find a couple angels (Not many, somwhere between 5 &amp;amp; 15) that have come to feed on the time energy from the anomoly. After a while, his companion(s) get picked off and sent back in time by the angels (This isn't showed on screen, it is only implied). After the doctor is the only one left and really pissed off, he manages to destroy some of the angels using a series of mirrors to make it so they are looking at themselves, but is eventually ovepowered and sent back in time. This is where it gets (more) interesting. He is sent back in time in the TARDIS right before he lands on the planet, where the past 11th doctor + companion(s) are. He stays out of sight, and after the companions leave, and goes and rescues his companion(s) before they are killed by the angels. However, as they are going back, since the time is especially weak around the anomoly, the universe can't support the paradox of the two doctors existing at once, even though they aren't interacting with eachother. This causes the doctor to slowly start disibtergrating. This ouput of energy attracts the angels, and they doctor realizes that the only way for him to survive is for the angels to attack him and send him somehwere far away from his past self. He tells his companion to go to the tardis, and he will call her when he needs to be picked up. Then the angels come and send him back. By this time, although safe, the disintergration process has gone to far abd he must regenerate. He then calls his companion in the tardis and tells here where to find him and then they go off.

Sorry if it's a bit lengthy, also, sorry for any spelling mistakes, i'm on my mobile and typing is a little difficult.

Part Two: He has longish strawberry blonde hair that looks as though it's never been brished, and is medium height with a bony frame. He has freckles and pale skin, and he has two different coloured eyes, one green and one hazel.

**EDIT: Forgot about personality, sorry. He is more serious then the other doctors, but often saysthings that dont make sense at the time but are later found to be relevent, although he cant account for this at first ( It is later revealed that prolonged exposure to the time vortex has given him a small amount of power to know things that are going to happen, albeit quite subtly. His dress is Like the 10th doctor's minus the trench coat, and he usually has a vest with his tie tucked in.

* You have to have the right to have your body treated decently and with respect when you die. It's your body, not someone else's

With that in mind there are obvious benefits to an opt-out register, namely more organs.

But would the screening system and transport of said organs be able to cope with a large influx of potentially less usable organs (I'm talking about volume rather than ratio). Are there problems for example with using lungs from smokers? I know my liver's pretty shot, my lungs and heart aren't particularly good and my eyesight is terrible. If the register became opt out would a large influx of bodies like mine affect people's waiting times for organs?

Minimum pricing effectively fixes up the low end drinks market in supermarkets.

The supermarkets will pocket the difference (as it'll be a retail price, not a wholesale minimum price).

Introducing taxation will mean that the funds will go to the treasury, not to the NHS, not to any programmes to help with alcoholism.

Either proposal limits the poor's ability to drink. Whatever price it's set at, it will go up over time (it has to follow the devaluation of money over time at the very least). When viewed as a Labour proposal, this is a prime example of the nanny state trying to control what you as an individual are allowed to put into your body, while lacking the courage of their convictions to go all the way and limit the amount of alcohol a person can buy in a period (which would be far more effective at preventing alcohol abuse without actually being very effective for all the same reasons minimum pricing would fail).

An alcoholic doesn't stop being an alcoholic when they can no longer afford to drink. As an alcoholic I can tell you that once you get to the stage where you're costing the NHS money, you're going to continue to cost them money even if you stop tomorrow. You're going to have caused yourself damage and you're probably going to need treatment to some extent for the rest of your life. That boat has already sailed by the time you receive alcoholism treatment.

If you're an alcoholic and you can't afford to drink whatever's your normal tipple you'll go looking elsewhere for it. You might try denatured alcohol which will cause even more damage. It's not uncommon for alcoholics who can't get alcohol to drink things like mouthwash or perfume, or even things like meths. If you really really can't get alcohol then you might try to make your own which you're likely to screw up (by drinking methanol or having unsanitary kit). If you get the DTs then you're probably going to look for something to help you cope like valium or benzos, potentially introducing another addiction that'll damage you into the mix.

In addition, all the subtle things you don't normally think about can be very depressing. Despite the stereotype, NHS food is fairly tolerable, but it was very rarely what I want to eat.

true,bowling4meth,english,Straight out of Surrey,"&gt; That does sound pretty bleak, I hope your not describing your own experience?

I never drank mouthwash but there were quite a few people in my group that did. One guy in my support group drank meths and damaged his CNS so he can't see properly or feel down his right arm. I've done a lot worse than alcohol so I think I'm pretty lucky and I'm also quite well off so minimum pricing is unlikely to affect me.

I think you're right about the concern being levelled at alcoholism itself rather than tinkering around the edges. A recent report (that was ignored) sorted drugs in order of health and social harm and alcohol was right at the top. There needs to be a proper wholesale reform of drug law (which currently is a separate issue) but alcohol should be dealt with at the same time if that ever happens.

Minimum unit pricing is something I remain unconvinced of mainly because of my own and my experience of others but I would love to see some real rather than anecdata and my mind is open to change on the matter. Does anyone know if the costs of alcohol abuse are increasing or decreasing?

&gt; So I don't agree with the idea that ""it's my body, I can put what I like into it"", especially as we have a system that shares the cost of healthcare.

I think we have to agree to disagree here. I don't have a choice about the cost of healthcare or whether or not I receive it or pay for it or what goes into it, and feel that's a bigger issue. What I do know is that I have a choice about my body and what I do with it, and that's something I'd very much like to keep to myself without state interference.

&gt; Reddit complains about the finance sector wanting to have privatized profits while socializing the losses

Reddit and particularly r/uk and r/ukpolitics has a very vocal skew in a particular direction. I left r/ukpolitics because I felt I could no longer engage in debate and sometimes it's similar here. I realise that a lot of my views are way further right than most of reddit but I also accept that others are different. I think there's a fair amount of people who feel that the banks socialisation of losses is a moral or class war issue. I oppose the socialisation of losses on the grounds of moral hazard. Also, if a government has no real rights to the profits beyond taxation, what rights should a company or industry have to hand losses over to the government?

I can't speak for others but have talked about the need for welfare reform before. I appreciate where you're coming from though. That's the thing though, people aren't rational. If you've got an alcoholic relative you might feel that way about the banks and healthcare. What I can say is that I try to avoid using NHS resources as much as I can while paying for private treatment as much as I can (partly for similar reasons to the one's you highlighted - my choice, I shouldn't strain the system, but also because the system doesn't work for me, whereas private does fare better).",0,1325162987,null,0,false,0,c3c3ztu,t3_ntj1y,t1_c3c3ztu,t1_c3c3k3o,1428092028,4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,4

If you are living a Shitty Life, with a lower educational level, a lack of control or choice in your life, and someone offers you something nice it's harder to turn it down.

If these were people good at maths and self control they probably wouldn't be sucked in by these scams, and generally wouldn't spend a long period of time at the bottom of society.

Remember that most of 'these people' have been poor *forever*. They can't choose where they live and barely have choice about food and clothing, nevermind holidays. It's not the same as a year out of work, it's their entire existence and there is no hope of it getting better. 

But we still force them to look at advertising at every turn that taunts them with all the things they can't have, constantly reminding them how shit their life is. And then someone offers them a way to get one of those things. Well what do you expect them to do? Turn it down? If you were starving hungry and someone offered you an overpriced, low quality meal, last chance for another day, you'd probably pay for it, no? Ok that isn't an amazing analogy but you get the idea?

&gt;It's blatantly obvious that they will jack up the prices to counter their approach

No, it's not obvious. That's the problem. It's obvious to *you* but that doesn't mean it's obvious to anyone else - and it clearly isn't. Not everyone has the same level of intelligence, education and general knowledge as you.

&gt;and I'd have thought that they'd have to tell the customer the full price at some point.

Saying x payments for £y is giving all the information, but obfuscating it nicely. If you're able to take interest out of it and say x payments for £z + interest it makes it even harder.

A bank might be able to process a loan for you at a low interest rate because the payments are by direct debit and you have a long history of regular wage deposits into the account.

A person without those will be paying cash over the counter - or on the doorstep - which pushes the costs up dramatically. They also have a much higher default rate, which has to be absorbed into the interest rates paid by everyone else.

I happen to think that local community banks would be a better very long term solution - but simply banning licensed operators from charging high interest rates means they will shut down, and either the poor go without the ability to borrow in times of need, or they go to illegal loan sharks.

There's payday loan places appearing everywhere now, in far far greater numbers. Once low income families start going there it's incredibly difficult for them to stop. They claim their 1000% APR is fine because it's only on a short term loan, however most people cannot afford to pay it back on their next pay day. So they end up permanently using them and it's exactly the same effect as a £50 bill each payday.

As for Brighthouse what they're doing is charging a cost for finance twice. It's very difficult to legislate against this because you can't control prices for things in shops. I can't think of an easy way to write legislation that would hammer Brighthouse without causing a great deal of extra work.

The only positive thing I can think of with Brighthouse is for their credit license to be suspended if they were found to be intentionally misrepresenting the APR of things because they were inflating prices beyond reasonable prices on the market. 

The TV that Ivashkin linked is a 46 inch TV that I can find elsewhere for at most £1,200. So it would at least stand up that Brighthouse were far overcharging what they should be for the item and lying about APRs.

Ultimately though most of us here would look at a TV to buy and find it at £1,000 and end up paying £700. It wouldn't sell where it was listed at £1,000 and would be at that price so that they could list it on sale with £300 off and say it was a the higher price for 28 days... however places like Brighthouse and other usurers would always sell it at the higher price, which is a straight 50% extra before you look at interest.

Note, for example, that the correlation between price and consumption has quite a different effect between types of alcohol.

Well, that means a little research is in order.

Firstly [Snopes](http://www.snopes.com/medical/emergent/donor.asp) though that's not specifically UK.

On to the Mail: Links from the Mail are somewhat confused - they don't seem to have a particular position, which is a good thing I suppose in terms of 'balance'. But overall it seems they publish 'good' donation stories.

&gt; [As this little boy lay dying, his parents took a decision that saved FOUR lives - and will move you beyond words](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-2073328/As-little-boy-lay-dying-parents-took-decision-saved-FOUR-lives--words.html) - Dec 2011

With regards to the story you cite, I can't find anything specific from the Mail or anywhere else. All I turn up is people wondering if that's what happens and asking if there have been any studies on the subject.

But consider the reality of the situation: You have an accident and come into A&amp;E and there are nurses, doctors etc. there who will immediately be told by the paramedics what's up. They try and stabilise and sort you out. How many of those people, who are at that time working specifically in A&amp;E and nowhere else (junior doctors, doctors on rotation or nurses) at that particular time are going to be thinking ""Ah good, some kidneys for the guy upstairs on dialysis"" ? How many of them *know* about all the transplant patients waiting and how many of them would be 'OK' with cutting lives short because it would improve, perhaps briefly, a life elsewhere?

Zero to none?

I think credit unions are essentially what you are supporting here which typically evaluate borrowing dependent on past examples of your repayments, but for first-time borrowers, allow you to only borrow like 50% of your current savings with them, and then increase your loan amounts as you prove you are able to repay stuff. I guess the idea being that if you default on your first loan, they can recoup loss from savings. 
And I agree - this is exactly the sort of systems we should be supporting to enable people to borrow when necessary without being ripped off.

I would make this the core question of the 50th Anniversary Special. 

I would have the Doctor regress through his past regenerations, as whoever asks the Question gets closer to the answer. Somehow, some past regenerations also get to work together (because that's where the fun in a a multi-Doctor story is). This would allow for both archival footage, or some kind of CGI footage for actors that are deceased or otherwise not participating. It also means we're not seeing the Doctors as they were at the time, but rather the Doctors that still ""live"" inside his head as memories. Which explains any aging. All this basically means I want to see Tom Baker, Peter Davison, Colin Baker, Sylvester McCoy, Paul McGann and David Tennant returning (Hartnell, Troughton, Pertwee and Ecclestone are ruled out). A grand retrospective of the Doctor's adventures, featuring past companions. Basically, we're not time travelling, but travelling inside the Doctor's head, looking for the answer. 

""No living creature may speak falsely or fail to answer"".. that probably means that ultimately he has to die to get out of this one. He cannot ever answer the Question, because it would literally mean the end of the Doctor Who universe (as in.. the TV show ends when the question is answered!).

The Anniversary Special ends with a regeneration into Doctor Twelve.

Watch out for some of their gimmicks they do, e.g. free PS3 etc. Usual rules apply here, it's not free, you're paying it in your contract.

One thing that did however bother me and cause concern was near the end after signing the paperwork etc, they ask for a list of ""10 friends"" numbers that *may* be interested in getting an upgrade. Both times I've refused to give them numbers as I don't feel it's fair to my friends to give away their numbers to receive unsolicited phone calls.

true,Axius,uk,United Kingdom,"If you drop out after accepting the loan for the second term, you will be billed for immediate repayment if you do not start the term and attend for a certain percentage of the time. Tuition fee payments made may also be collected, but this varies. Benefits and the likes for being out of University may be subject to review also, but I am not sure on this particular point so do not hold me to it.

If I'm correct, most first years of degrees do not count towards the overall degree; I advise you explain your situation and you may be able to get an extension on the due date. 

Of course, this depends on if you definitely want to quit. If you want to quit, see your course supervisor ASAP and discuss the problems you're having with the course. They may be able to help convince you to make your decision one way or the other and perhaps help you manage your workload.

Your best bet is to see the year out, talk to the tutors and look at the material in the other years of the course. See what you think after that. If you finish the year, the certificate will mean that you should be able to rejoin the course later in a following year when things may be better.

Just do not shoot yourself in the foot by dropping out based on the first year without informing yourself.

EDIT:
I dropped out about this long into the second year of my course when I was 20. I've since gone back (I'm 26 now) to finish it because I couldn't manage it at the time, and I'm finding it a lot easier and enjoyable as I've had the time out to think about it all.

It really is the case that with a normal bank account, running your finances in a way that would please a credit union would also please a bank and allow access to cheap overdrafts at 20% APR, or credit cards at the same. Please don't think because that isn't competitive with market leading lending costs it's a bad rate... on a £200 loan paid off over a year it's a tenner.

The problem is that both credit unions and banks exclude the types of people that we want to be able to buy a fridge or boiler when it packs in - the people who are shit with money and spend every coin they can get their hands on. 

The only solution is for some kind of lending centre to deduct from benefits over a long period of time, and ensure that the money lent was indeed for a necessity. And that would mean either empowering financial institutions to garnish benefits (and I could not sleep at night if the types of fuckers that currently lend to low incomes could do that) or it means some kind of ability to do crisis loans by something like CAB.

I would agree it's needed here.. and I can think of two ways to sort it.

1) Ban the sale of credit at the point of sale of goods. That way people can shop around for the goods and shop around for the credit separately. 

2) Limit APR to 30% and administration fees to £15. 

However before that's done we need to be sure that we're not cutting off a vital form of lending to our most disadvantaged citizens... I do not believe that we are, but that's entirely based on what I've seen in my career and obviously not enough to go on.

true,LokianEule,mccoy,Time's Champion,"First of all, finish Genesis of the Daleks. It's good! Then after that, watch the first episode ever, An Unearthly Child (just part 1). You need to know where things started.
And a quick rundown of the Doctors..

**William Hartnell, first**- The beginnings of the series. It needs forgiveness as it's very slow, and the Doctor is kind of a jerk at first, but there are some stories I really like. The Aztecs. It's a historical. Something DW doesn't do anymore.

**Patrick Troughton, second** - Patrick Troughton is basically Matt Smith, but in the '60s. He's all silly/bumbly, but don't let that fool you, he kicks butt. His run is mostly missing thanks to the BBC but there are reconstructions. And they also suffer from '60s slowness. Watch: The Mind Robber. Tomb of the Cybermen. And if you can do reconstructions: Power of the Daleks. And the War Games last.
Jon Pertwee, third- A weird run as most stories are on Earth (for story reasons explained). You meet the Master. This is when things really start to modernize and feel like they were made in the 20th century. Spearhead from Space, his first story. Inferno starts a little slow but picks up when the Doctor ends up in an alternate universe where everyone is evil. Like that Star Trek story. The Time Warrior introduces the famous companion Sarah Jane. Curse of Peladon, The Three Doctors, Day of the Daleks and last Planet of the Spiders are also good.

**Tom Baker, fourth** The most famous run. This is when the writing enters a higher standard in Doctor Who. There are so many fantastic stories, and it's the run in which Genesis of the Daleks occurs. One of the most famous classic stories, and the one that got me into classic (above). So I say Genesis of the Daleks, Robots of Death, Face of Evil, Warrior's Gate, Deadly Assassin (for Time Lord history if anything), Horror of Fang Rock, Sunmakers, and of course lastly Logopolis.

**Peter Davison, fifth** -Earthshock, Castrovalva (2nd half picks up), Kinda, Snakedance, Mawdryn Undead, Terminus, and Enlightenment. And The Five Doctors, which is the 25th anniversary special. EDIT: wait, how could I forget Caves of Androzani?! The last 5th Doctor story.

**Colin Baker, sixth** - Just want to say, Colin got fired. Poor guy. His Doctor is a drastic change with the flamboyant technicolor dreamcoat and bombastic crazy personality. If you can get used to him, he cracks you up and makes you laugh. He's a bit abrasive but so is the first doctor. His best is easily Vengance on Varos and Attack of the Cybermen, and Revelation of the Daleks. And if you want to try Trial of a Timelord (which is an entire season) it's pretty good. The Vervoid one is the weakest story I think. The sixth is the most underappreciated and maybe disliked Doctor. People say his era is crap, so when I went into it I was worried but pleasantly surprised. Because his era is NOT crap, it's only got a couple real stinkers, like any run does.

**Sylvester McCoy, seventh**. Personally, my favorite Doctor. This is easy. Remembrance of the Daleks, The Curse of Fenric, The Greatest Show in the Galaxy, Battlefield. Good mention to The Happiness Patrol, Ghost Light, Silver Nemesis. This is the era where they really try some crazy radical stories.

For further info about the show's development/tone as it changes and actors etc. read the comment by Slotosky here, upon which my own post was based:

You should choose between 2005 reluanch and 2010 when the new writer, Doctor, and companions took over. It felt very much like a re-relaunch.

Pros of 2005: you get to see more Doctors, more adventures, companions, etc. You won't miss out on it by skipping it. No prior info needed to watch here

Cons: It's a bit cheesy and the writing needs a lot of forgiveness the first two series. The show still shines though.

For 2010 Pros: Great writing, shiny new everything, same awesomeness that DW always has, fresh start, no prior info needed

Cons: You miss out on 2005-2009. You won't get to experience the show chronologically and see how things change and develop. You'll get spoiled by the special effects.

Even with these pros and cons, if you choose 2010 you should go back afterwards to 2005 and up. While the writing and effects may not be as shiny, there are still wonderful heartbreaking stories here, and both Doctors absolutely shine.

 I grew up adoring the Doctor in a few different regenerations, and when he isn't really in the episode, I feel a bit cheated.

No.  It's implied to mean that the Doctor had a wife (or at least a child) while he still lived on Gallifrey.  Then his child had a daughter named Susan, who the Doctor took with him when he stole the TARDIS and fled Gallifrey.

We don't know who Susan's parents are, or which of them was the Doctor's offspring.  It's heavily implied that her parents, any siblings, and her grandmother died in the Time War.

When Germany re-unified it took a while but by '93/94 Germany was starting to realise that it would become the main economic powerhouse of Europe. Since Chirac, France shifted from being a force for good (i.e. France) in EU integration to being a force for disharmony if things didn't go their way. In a way, France is the enfant terrible of Europe for want of a better term but does a fantastic job of transference and distraction.

Another way to look at the EU is to look at how all the countries that joined before the turn of the century had a vested interest in keeping Germany in a box. Almost all the ones afterwards wanted to secure their independence from Soviet Union (or successor state) influence without subjugating to another. This makes for an interesting dynamic.

I don't doubt that we've had some good things in Europe as a country, and to be fair I do support some sort of trade and political union in Europe, but it needs to be much more fairer, accountable and transparent than it currently is, and it needs to serve the union as a whole and not disproportionately favour certain members.",0,1325201274,null,0,false,0,c3c8x8o,t3_ntgxg,t1_c3c8x8o,t1_c3c49m5,1428094445,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

Simple interest is the only interest that's ever charged. Compound interest is just the result where the term of the loan exceeds the period at which interest is applied.

If you borrow the 100 dollars at the 10% interest rate at the end of the year you repay 110 dollars. That's fine. But you're unlikely to borrow for one year.  So at the end of one year you owe 110 dollars and you say ""Ok I can only repay you if you lend me 55 dollars"" so you repay the 110 after taking the 55 loan... you then pay 61 at the end of the year.. and  you've paid compound interest. That's the only way to do things fairly.

If you instead want to agree across the term of a loan how much interest will be paid and express it as a simple interest rate not an APR or compounded rate then fine do so, but you're just expressing it differently, it doesn't stop it being compounded.

I've been thinking for a while that this kind of self-organisation is necessary, and we might be entering a long period where conditions are ideal for the growth of these things. 

In my more tinfoil hat moments I sometimes think we might be heading for a huge expansion of the grey/black economy. I'm thinking in terms of the state withdrawing from certain areas and only policing the borders. Within these areas we will see the growth of alternate societies, the way that happened in Notting Hill squats in the 70s, places like Christiana. There were small areas like this in London in the 80s, parts of Brixton and Vauxhall and hundreds of smaller ones. Of course the state was always stepping in, but there was a kind of economy working in these places. But the plan these days seems to be withdraw the state, allow for localism. I don't think this is what they have in mind, but if the momentum is there, can they really object? it'll make for an interesting confrontation anyway.

Well I'm probably just dreaming, and I'm a bit old to be squatting now, too fond of my comforts. Might try and torrent a washing machine repair manual though.

There's a better argument for Maxi to be included in the team, especially considering his scoring record.  He has got some starts the last few games and to be honest I don't think he has played very well.  He's super intelligent and technically very good, but he is SLOW.  Seriously, I do not care for him playing centrally/in the whole behind Suarez.  Every time he received the ball the play would instantly slow down.  Don't get me wrong, I think a slow build up is good most of the time, but I felt like he shut down any chance of a fast counterattack type play.  That being said, I think when he has played out wider he has done a much better job since he can drift in and still get involved in the play but isn't the pivotal figure in building up an attack.

Usury arises from the money monopoly - in a free (money) market, interest would merely cover costs and risk, it would not support capital accumulation.  The power to charge usurious rates has been secured through State intervention in licensing banks, setting out capitalisation requirements and other barriers to entry which artificially restrict the supply of credit.  If you think about it, a secured loan doesn't actually entail the lending of anything, it's merely the provision of a liquidity service - most often in modern banking terms, with someone else's capital, which usually represents others' labour.  Effectively with a secured loan against property, it's really the borrower him or herself who provides the capital.  The banks look increasingly like they fulfil a middleman role, which at most merits a fee, yet extract a usurious rate of interest because the government has their back.

Although I've got to admit this year's lineup was pretty apalling. Ross always tries to make the show about himself, Oliver was out of his depth, Walliams and Hart utilised the worst attributes of their act and David Mitchell just seemed to be there to collect his paycheck. Only Eddie Izzard seemed a breath of fresh air.

Kudos to them for trying now faces (in Hart, Izzard and Oliver) but next time they should get people with more established comedic pedigree. Stephen Fry or Chris Morris would certainly be interesting to see on the quiz, perhaps they could even try to get Reeves &amp; Mortimer on.

Also, in my opinion, Series 5 and 6 altogether have a lot more consistently good episodes as opposed to the rest of the series. Yes, there are some amazing episodes in series 1-4 that definitely need a watch, but you have to sift through some rubbish ones too. There's not one episode I would not watch again from Series 5-6, whilst I can't say the same for the other series, I can probably pick a few from each series.

Since there is such a direct correlation between Ramires and good offensive performances, it makes me think even more that we need to purchase another engine in midfield for when Ramires is injured/tired from playing every single match in a long season. Someone like a Tiote, as we have all been saying for a while. Hopefully (fingers crossed), Essien comes back 100% and picks up where he left off. I am so excited to get him back in the squad, I can hardly stand it.

On the other side of the ball, all of this talk about Romeu returning to Barca in 2013 worries me. He seems to be the player we have been hoping that Mikel would develop into over the past few years, but I can't help but feel like he's just on long-term loan to Chelsea. In turn, we need to find someone in the next few years that can take over that role and make it their own. I love Mikel, and he might kick it into gear, but he just doesn't own the midfield like Romeu does defensively.

I'm sure everyone just absolutely hated me for it, but it was the only place I could go and not feel like the fat bumbling friendless idiot of my childhood. 

Doctor Who is not nearly as important to me as Harry Potter once was, but I do think that, if given the option, I would choose a TARDIS over Hogwarts these days. It's a little sad, actually, but I guess it means I'm over the time in my life where I needed that and that can only be a good thing.

But Jamie, Ace, Leela, Sarah Jane, Martha, Donna, Grace, etc. Love em all!

Martha was really strong and got away from a her pining after the Doctor. She was smart and resourceful. Donna knew when to stop and challenge the Doctor, who as the tenth, *really* needed it.

Ace was the first companion to challenge the Doctor and be more than a question machine for the audience. She had a background and the Doctor was like a mentor to her. And she made bombs, hello, how kickass is that?

And Leela with her savagery, fiercely loyal even if she didn't understand half the things going around. She once said something like, 'If you do not listen to the Old One, I will cut out your heart!'. She liked calling the Doctor the Old One. Which is a lot better than the Evil One.

Jamie was awesome too. It was like the ultimate bromance and he reminds me of Leela. Not really sure what was going on, but fiercely loyal and hilarious with that kilt.

And Grace- it was nice to have an adult companion who didn't seem like she was being guided around and entranced by the Doctor. She wasn't just a question machine, she was independent. And she was the first to snog the Doctor, but they both knew they weren't really couple material. And that was nice.

Need I even point out why Sarah Jane is a kickass companion? She didn't take crap from anyone, aliens, men, the Doctor, or anyone. She was smart and resourceful and a beloved companion whose stuck around this whole time.

Arsenal | **382m** | 110m | 136m
Chelsea | 213m | **174m** | 734m

I appreciate the future prospects such as Henderson and Carroll and I think they will shine, they just seem to have the Lucas syndrome (need time to get acclimated but when they finally do they will be indispensable). Then there's Charlie Adam.

I think getting rid of Adam should be the first priority but I don't know if we should replace him with a similar vein of midfielder.  I'm torn between signing for the future and signing to win now but I'd really like to see Christian Eriksen or Mario Goetze come to Liverpool.  I'd also like to see a clinical striker but with Carroll and Suarez in our squad I don't really see that happening. 

That being said, I don't know how much we really need to rely on signings.  I think our academy has some good players that could use a run about.  I used to absolutely despise Jonjo Shelvey, but he has improved at an incredible rate recently and would love to see him get some playing time.

true,LokianEule,mccoy,Time's Champion,"First of all, finish Genesis of the Daleks. It's good! Then after that, watch the first episode ever, An Unearthly Child (just part 1). You need to know where things started. And a quick rundown of the Doctors..

**William Hartnell, first**- The beginnings of the series. It needs forgiveness as it's very slow, and the Doctor is kind of a jerk at first, but there are some stories I really like. The Aztecs. It's a historical. Something DW doesn't do anymore.

**Patrick Troughton, second** - Patrick Troughton is basically Matt Smith, but in the '60s. He's all silly/bumbly, but don't let that fool you, he kicks butt. His run is mostly missing thanks to the BBC but there are reconstructions. And they also suffer from '60s slowness. Watch: The Mind Robber. Tomb of the Cybermen. And if you can do reconstructions: Power of the Daleks. And the War Games last.

**Jon Pertwee, third**- A weird run as most stories are on Earth (for story reasons explained). You meet the Master. This is when things really start to modernize and feel like they were made in the 20th century. Spearhead from Space, his first story. Inferno starts a little slow but picks up when the Doctor ends up in an alternate universe where everyone is evil. Like that Star Trek story. The Time Warrior introduces the famous companion Sarah Jane. Curse of Peladon, The Three Doctors, Day of the Daleks and last Planet of the Spiders are also good.

**Tom Baker, fourth** The most famous run. This is when the writing enters a higher standard in Doctor Who. There are so many fantastic stories, and it's the run in which Genesis of the Daleks occurs. One of the most famous classic stories, and the one that got me into classic (above). So I say Genesis of the Daleks, Robots of Death, Face of Evil, Warrior's Gate, Deadly Assassin (for Time Lord history if anything), Horror of Fang Rock, Sunmakers, and of course lastly Logopolis.

**Peter Davison, fifth** -Earthshock, Castrovalva (2nd half picks up), Kinda, Snakedance, Mawdryn Undead, Terminus, and Enlightenment. And The Five Doctors, which is the 25th anniversary special. EDIT: wait, how could I forget Caves of Androzani?! The last 5th Doctor story.

**Colin Baker, sixth**- Just want to say, Colin got fired. Poor guy. His Doctor is a drastic change with the flamboyant technicolor dreamcoat and bombastic crazy personality. If you can get used to him, he cracks you up and makes you laugh. He's a bit abrasive but so is the first doctor. His best is easily Vengance on Varos and Attack of the Cybermen, and Revelation of the Daleks. And if you want to try Trial of a Timelord (which is an entire season) it's pretty good. The Vervoid one is the weakest story I think. The sixth is the most underappreciated and maybe disliked Doctor. People say his era is crap, so when I went into it I was worried but pleasantly surprised. Because his era is NOT crap, it's only got a couple real stinkers, like any run does.

**Sylvester McCoy, seventh**. Personally, my favorite Doctor. This is easy. Remembrance of the Daleks, The Curse of Fenric, The Greatest Show in the Galaxy, Battlefield. Good mention to The Happiness Patrol, Ghost Light, Silver Nemesis. This is the era where they really try some crazy radical stories.

It was easier to keep bad companies going by giving them a bit more lending than it was to call in the receivers.

I agree that it's quite easy to explain it that the banks aren't actually lending money.. however I don't think it really matters. 

We need a competitive banking sector where companies and individuals can obtain inexpensive credit. Commercial lending is expensive at the moment because banks aren't as competitive as they could be, but more importantly because businesses are defaulting.

Banks will get more competitive over time, and the economic position will improve, when those things happen then business lending margins will decrease.

God, he becomes insufferable very quickly afterwards though. Always running off to join the bad guys, slagging off the girls, being an annoying know it all nerd.

(I think the writers have thought of it as well, and that's why the one-offs often are from the past or future. But they wouldn't make a full-time companion.) The companion is the stand-in for the audience--so it needs to be someone with our general perception and understanding of the world (and universe) who then experiences everything the doctor shows them as if it were us (i.e., seeing it for the first time, trying to make sense of it and fit it into our understanding of the world). They go through the same excitement and discovery, more or less, that the audience does. Changing that would remove a dramatic element.

Having a companion from the past wouldn't serve that purpose because just being in our time would be new and amazing and otherworldly. Seeing someone amazed at something that's everyday for us gets old quickly.

Having a companion from the future wouldn't serve the purpose because anything that happens in our time would be history to them--and some of that excitement and sense of discovery would be lost. (When the doctor and his companion go into the past, it's usually for historically identifiable big moments/eras--so that dramatic excitement is still there. Any moment now doesn't have the same grand-scheme drama to it because we live in it.)

Among others like the telecoms and rail industries, both of which have been on a steady downward spiral since their privatisation. The former is a key bugbear of mine with for-profit companies having no incentive to modernise Britain's creaking telecoms infrastructure outside of major cities, leaving smaller towns and rural areas with unreliable and inefficient connections. Also rail fares have gotten more expensive, and what have we got for it? A less reliable service with a bunch of different competing companies for absolutely no reason!

I find it interesting that you deride the unions in one paragraph, then go on to put down those that ""whinge about their lot"" - strikes and protests are people's ways of demonstrating that they're unhappy about their situations.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt; The former is a key bugbear of mine with for-profit companies having no incentive to modernise Britain's creaking telecoms infrastructure outside of major cities, leaving smaller towns and rural areas with unreliable and inefficient connections.

Could you name a country of similar size/stature/density whose state owned telco has fibre to every home? I don't count a few eastern European countries. I'm thinking France, Germany, the US, etc. I'll give you some time.

Hell, even Sweden, the so called broadband paradise isn't so hot. At least the people I know there can't get the 100Mbit packages that everyone seems to think you can get. They have ADSL2+ - not much different to the UK, then.

I would find it hard to believe that if the GPO were still around there would be some sort of utopia where everyone would have 192384294Gbit fibre optic broadband. After all, around the time of BT's formation you had to be on a **multi-month waiting list for a phone line**.

In some areas there is an attempt to make things better. The deprived county that I live in is fortunate enough to have access to EU funds - and as a result either fibre to the cabinet or fibre to the premises is being made available to 80+% of the county with other solutions for the rest. I get my connection installed next week. (the funding is roughly 50% EU and county council, 50% BT's own cash). This scheme appears to be so successful (in terms of coverage and speed of rollout) that some people are wondering why similar schemes elsewhere are running so slowly and not covering anywhere near the same area. Mostly thanks to a Conservative-led county council too - who'd have thought?

Let's not forget that BT has only just pulled its finger out its arse, so to speak. ADSL in the beginning was only available in a few places, but eventually it became ubiquitous (and I speak as someone whose exchange only got it in 2005). Who is to say that FTTC/P isn't going to be the same?

&gt; Also rail fares have gotten more expensive, and what have we got for it? A less reliable service with a bunch of different competing companies for absolutely no reason.

I'll agree that railway privatisation was a shambles. But don't forget the place of government in the whole sorry story. 

It is the Department for Transport that basically calls the shots - what the train companies can run, when they can run them, where they can run them, whether they can buy new trains (and when they are allowed the politicians get involved and make a simple task draw out over tens of years and billions of pounds), where Network Rail can make investment, etc etc etc. Either nationalise the whole lot or let the train companies make their own decisions.

&gt; I find it interesting that you deride the unions in one paragraph, then go on to put down those that ""whinge about their lot"" - strikes and protests are people's ways of demonstrating that they're unhappy about their situations.

It's all about practicality. Unions who do nothing more than try to protect their members without realising the big picture have only themselves to blame when their industry collapses because someone else can do it more cheaply elsewhere. Unfortunately some unions do this in an industry which will not die out of necessity (I'm thinking of the RMT and co - no one is going to shut down public transport).

&gt; I live in west-central Scotland which bore the brunt of her government's terrible ideas, not least of which was the closure of [1] an enormous steelworks a few miles away from here which put a full ten thousand people out of work in one fell swoop, condemning an entire region to a generation of poverty which is only just beginning to be redressed.

Was it needed? No point having a steelworks if it isn't productive. Closer to me is the entire china clay mining industry (and slightly further afield other types of mining). The industry is in decline because it is believed that the same quality clay can be obtained elsewhere. Should I be blaming Thatcher for this? This is an industry that was never in state owned hands.",0,1325261764,null,0,true,0,c3cg4ix,t3_nvko6,t1_c3cg4ix,t1_c3cg0m9,1428097881,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

The law aims to maintain the integrity of politicians, but in reality all it does is force the satirists to do reconstructions of the events they can't show.

These inevitably make whatever gaff is being satirized even more ridiculous, so if anything it saps the integrity of politicians even more then if they had just let them use the actual footage.

We're going to be hosting the next Board Games night next Wednesday (4th January) from 6:30pm.

We'll be playing a selection of games, from modern classics like Carcassone and Citadels through to some of the more unusual games you only find on http://boardgamegeek.com.

Some of the games we've got down at the Hackspace are:

* Carcassonne
* Power Grid
* Stone Age
* Citadels
* Ticket To Ride: Europe
* Small World

Or, bring your own game and show us how to play it! We might also be doing some remixes of classic board game favourites if Monopoly, Scrabble or Cluedo are more your kind of thing!

We're based at Brighton Hackspace in the Rodhus building on Hollingdean Road, BN2 4AA, and hold board gaming evenings on the first Wednesday of the month.

Hope to see some of you there!

I can't cite any specific examples of this, but does that necessarily invalidate the idea? I don't think there's any solid argument against such a thing despite it potentially being very costly to implement, which is something that would be largely irrelevant if it was carried out by a state entity and would most likely be recouped fairly rapidly with the proven economic benefits of access to high-speed internet. While I agree that the GPO's continued existence in itself wouldn't have inherently meant this, I'd bet it'd result in a far better climate for users than the multitude of overpriced and underperforming services currently on offer.

It's good that your region's receiving the benefit of the funding in place to improve the infrastructure, and I hope it spreads to many other areas  - the pace of expansion has been glacial at best outwith city centres. Out of interest, how populated is your area? I live in a town of about 35,000 and get 3Mbps from ADSL on a good day.

As regards trains, most of the arguments I've read for renationalisation seem pretty compelling - the clusterfuck of different operating companies and the mess that travelling between regions entails sounds awful.

Just about anyone in this country has a choice of lots of ISPs - don't assume that our entire internet industry is BT/TalkTalk/Sky/Orange/Virgin. Lots of smaller players exist that are committed to good service although they charge more than most people want to pay.

In short I don't agree with a single player running the entire show - be it state owned or privately run. Competition is good.

&gt; It's good that your region's receiving the benefit of the funding in place to improve the infrastructure, and I hope it spreads to many other areas - the pace of expansion has been glacial at best outwith city centres. Out of interest, how populated is your area? I live in a town of about 35,000 and get 3Mbps from ADSL on a good day.

Village of 2000 - as I said I only got ADSL in 2005 - but I do at least get 8Mbit. It seems we're getting fibre to the cabinet at the same time as the nearby town of 20,000. If your town is as large as that I'm surprised that BT isn't working on something for it too. 

I agree that BT has been glacial but it seems that now that they've got a decent core network (the 21CN) they're finally getting on with offering something more than ADSL - with ADSL2+ being offered in and more and more places as well as FTTC and FTTP.

&gt; As regards trains, most of the arguments I've read for renationalisation seem pretty compelling - the clusterfuck of different operating companies and the mess that travelling between regions entails sounds awful.

Down here at least I don't have an issue with the way the two train companies inter-operate. I can buy a ticket between X and Y, and get on any train from either company that does that journey (in Cornwall and Devon they are mostly the same route). If one train company is having problems then arrangements are made pretty quickly to get people travelling on the other service.

&gt; That's exactly what unions are for, the protection of the interests of the workers which they represent - what's wrong with that?

If that's what our unions all want to do then it is a real shame. There's no point trying to protect outdated working practices if the industry or company is going to collapse, and thus employ no one, if nothing happens. Or, you could work with the company to help it modernise, stay viable, and employ some people (although not everyone).

&gt; There's always a demand for steel - whether the government was prepared to either a) continue supporting the British industry or b) failing that offer alternative jobs for the thousands which would be put out of work by its closure is another matter.

But that steel may well be obtained or processed elsewhere for a lower cost. You can't (certainly not under today's EU-centric legislation) force companies to buy British, and inevitably they'll go for the cheapest.

As for jobs - what can the government do? We've seen Labour try and use the public sector to prop up certain regions of the country, and the only result we seem to get is borrowing and debt.

I refer back to my comment about the china clay industry. A few years ago the larger of the two players announced the closure of a great amount of its works, favouring Brazilian clay instead. While their competitor bought a couple of the pits and took on a number of the displaced workers, a lot of them had to go on the dole. 

Where was the government then? Not a peep from them. That's why I have no time for people who whinge about the Conservatives and the North - because Labour are exactly the same (they favour Labour-leaning places over places that are as anti-Labour as you can get).",0,1325267729,null,0,false,0,c3ch1sp,t3_nvko6,t1_c3ch1sp,t1_c3cgso6,1428098318,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

It's definitely an enormous project which would take years to complete, but these have been done before with the creation of the National Grid and the initial copper-based telecoms network. This isn't necessarily the only option for widespread broadband access, mind - radio-based technologies are becoming more feasible, with trials of the [WiMAX](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wimax) system in particular proving promising. Again, however, this is something that'd still require a large amount of investment.

Smaller ISPs are definitely the way to go I think, and we're subscribed to Be broadband just now who offer pretty top-notch service at a reasonable price. We've previously been with Orange and BT, both of which were pretty shambolic in terms of what we got for the price we paid. My absolute ideal method of running the telecoms industry would be a single nationalised entity governed not by politicians but by a panel of elected experts refreshed on a biennial basis or so, with internet and telephone services provided to the entire population for free. This is just one small component of the mad utopia I have planned in my head though!

In Scotland all train services are run by a single operating company so we're largely free of those sorts of problems, but what I read was mostly concerned with the operations behind the scenes between operators - there's an overwhelmingly complex system used to determine which company gets penalised for late trains and by how much. It's the sort of thing that could easily be rationalised by having one entity doing it all.

I don't believe unions are the demons you're making them out to be - standing up for the rights of the workers is no bad thing. I don't believe they're the barriers to progress you make them out to be either, although there are always going to be problems when modernisation means loss of jobs. 

I'll be honest, I can't think of anything off the top of my head which could resolve either our steel situation or your clay situation. I believe these problems are symptomatic of the problems in the capitalism as a whole.

Don't think my anti-Conservative position in any way means I'm pro-Labour - over the years they've become a carbon-copy of the Tories in many respects, in terms of both social and economic policy.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt; Why do you believe it's impractical? 

Impractical in that no one wants to pay the astronomical sum for it. BT won't pay for it entirely on its own (and possibly, can't) and the government can't be seen to be doing it while cutting elsewhere. Giving everyone high speed broadband is great but some people think healthcare/education/etc are more important.

&gt; This isn't necessarily the only option for widespread broadband access, mind - radio-based technologies are becoming more feasible, with trials of the WiMAX system in particular proving promising. Again, however, this is something that'd still require a large amount of investment.

BT and friends (I think Everything Everywhere is one of them) are trialing LTE as an alternative solution here in Cornwall. I'm guessing this is what they plan to use in the parts of the county that are too unsuitable for traditional fibre to the *. 

Don't know if they plan to lobby Ofcom for a special licence to build a special Cornish network for a proper rollout designed for the job, considering 4G/LTE licences aren't being auctioned for some time yet.

&gt; Smaller ISPs are definitely the way to go I think, and we're subscribed to Be broadband just now who offer pretty top-notch service at a reasonable price.

Makes you wonder if Be can do what they're doing if they didn't have a large sugar daddy (O2, and Telefonica owning the lot) there to prop them up. None of the LLU-based ISPs are really small players (except for Rutland Telecom, Zen and maybe a couple of others but the number of exchanges they've done is probably less than 10 combined).

Bear in mind also that if/when fibre comes to where you are, Be don't look to be a part of it - and it seems like they want to put their own cabinets in streets, which may make their rollout even tinier than their current exchange-based setup.

&gt; In Scotland all train services are run by a single operating company so we're largely free of those sorts of problems, but what I read was mostly concerned with the operations behind the scenes between operators - there's an overwhelmingly complex system used to determine which company gets penalised for late trains and by how much. It's the sort of thing that could easily be rationalised by having one entity doing it all.

That system still exists in Scotland IIRC - because Network Rail is also required to make payments if it is their fault (e.g. if the track goes ""ping""), and whether they should reimburse accordingly. So a 3 or more way bloodbath as is in England becomes a 2 way bicker. Don't forget also that companies like Cross Country run services to some stations in Scotland so it's not entirely one company.

&gt; I don't believe unions are the demons you're making them out to be - standing up for the rights of the workers is no bad thing. I don't believe they're the barriers to progress you make them out to be either, although there are always going to be problems when modernisation means loss of jobs.

I don't disagree, but my key point is how unions concentrate solely on what they can get out of the employer for the short term gain of their employees, rather than the long term for them or their industry or company. You see this in industries like transport - with the RMT and/or ASLEF constantly demanding (and getting, unfortunately) payment or days off for its workers for ever stranger reasons (like working on Boxing Day). 

Rail drivers are not underpaid by any stretch, and any increase they do get just goes on our fares. Unfortunately they'll get what they want because they know that no one is going to let them strike and because transport is subsidised by the bottomless pit that is the taxpayer.

&gt; Don't think my anti-Conservative position in any way means I'm pro-Labour - over the years they've become a carbon-copy of the Tories in many respects, in terms of both social and economic policy. 

I never did, I'm mostly thinking of people in Labour leaning areas who will vote Labour because they think they don't let places fall into decline (except that they do when they aren't Labour heartlands).

&gt; For what it's worth I've voted [2] Scottish Socialist since I became of voting age, except for voting for LD in the General Election ... which I've came to regret!

People keep calling me a ""tory boy"", although I have never voted for them. I nominally support the Lib Dems although I voted for the local nationalist party (as in SNP type nationalism, not BNP) because I don't like the LD candidate - a wet behind the ears, no life experience, PPE graduate from Oxford.

You know, i really liked firefly, but it wasn't something i could watch over and over again.  I watch star trek reruns all the time, and i re-watch buffy and angel once every year or so.  Firefly just didn't have that 'rewatch me a billion times' power.  Sure, here and there, but it's not on my list of shit to re-watch.  I've watched through the whole thing once, and then picked up episodes here and there at friends houses or out of boredom.  Doctor who is something i could watch over and over as well... though only if i'm feeling particularly emotional.  Season finales are just heart wrenching for me.  BUT, i'm a big softy and it's not hard to do that to me. lol.  

If i had to truly pick a verse and live in it,  I would probably pick star trek.  I think they have the most opportunities for people, least amount of poverty, most amount of resources and aid, and most chance for exploring with limited peril to yourself.  There are tons of safe worlds to explore or live on.  It's a little more leisure exploration compared to doctor who where you would always be running somewhere and doing something.  (have they ever addressed if people actually sleep in the TARDIS?  i've only seen the 2005+ stuff)  It has the absolute best medical as well.  Plus, holodecks. xD

You can't just pack a dozen 100-story towerblocks together, fill them with anyone, let alone unemployed people, and expect anything better.

The recent change of letting people sell their flats is also a very interesting idea, and I think it has the potential of helping.  Recently I rented an apartment in an ex-council estate.  I spoke to the neighbours and people around, and several commented about how much better the area had become, and that people feel relatively safe now.

Is it acceptable to have our privacy invaded that way in order to cut benefit fraud? 

As to the false comparison between benefit fraud and tax evasion.. they are two different things. It is wrong to suggest that dealing with one will prevent you dealing with the other. The government needs to expand HMRCs departments that deal with tax evasion, they need to *drastically* simplify the taxation system and they need to work out if it really is good sense to have tax bills apparently waived in exchange for a nice fucking dinner. 

Where this Daily Mail blog entry does get it right in comparing them it's the governments emphasis. The morons at UK Uncut had a go at FTSE companies for not paying the tax they should, but the government instead goes after benefit cheats. The reason being that the core Tory voter is more concerned about ""scumbag benefit cheats"" than they are about companies not paying tax.. and ironically it's the Daily Mail who lead the charge there.

You're essentially saying that shareholders are naturally better managers than civil servants. This is however not necessarily the case. 

What makes capitalism so effective is the combination of an evolutionary arena in which companies can compete with the victors growing and the losers going bust. Combined with the ability for the consumer to choose who they want to do business with.

In our privatized railways neither of these good effects of capitalism are really in operation, the consumer has no choice and the companies can't compete with some failing and others growing. As such the only real result of privatization is yes to increase costs. 

We can contrast this with for example the electricity market which is HIGHLY regulated but exceptionally more efficient than any centrally controlled system could be.

I had really low expectations walking into it because i'd seen about twenty minutes of an episode randomly on tv.  (the one with matt smith where they're in the Britain that travels through space on that big space whale thing)  I was confused as shit with it, and was all 'why is this girl in her pajamas?  wtf are those creepy fortune telling robots?  this is stupid.'  I fell in love with the 9th doctor though.  Someone had explained to me a little of the doctor's history, and that the 9th was the one fresh from basically exterminating his people by locking them in time.  Gave some depth to the character right off for me, and i could see it with the way Eccleston portrayed him.  Plus, the chemistry between him and rose?  Phew.  That shit was great.

Yeah.  Had to move in with my mom, which is the only reason i'm in this rural hell hole.   And she just does not make a good substitute for friends. lol

Yes.  Enterprise. ;)  I watched TNG with my father as well.  It was one of the few American shows i got to watch growing up. We had one channel while living in Europe.  AFN.  (armed forces network)  

Replicators aren't as cool as bowties admittedly, but they're sure as fuck useful in day to day life. lol.   I however, have never experience the magic of a bunk bed, so i can make no personal judgement either way on that.

I might get something done on LSD, with the right positive coach to guide me into doing shit.  I've never done illegal drugs though, so there is no way in telling.  And since i had a problem with prescription drugs, i'll never find out.  No drugs of any kind for me. no siree.

When i rediscovered it actually i was like 'OOOH, that's what that episode was all about.' lol.  cracked my shit up to go back and actually enjoy that episode.  And after seeing the three doctors?  I have to agree that i think Matt Smith is doing a bang up job.  Tennant was great, but i think he had his charming cuteness to melt my woman parts in his favor.  Matt seems to just really 'get' the doctor character i have envisioned though.  I'll always love my first doctor, but that doesn't mean i can't love the others ;)

I live in Prosperity South Carolina.  Google maps it.  It's waaaay out.  I'm an hour from a mall.  And hour from the nearest gaming shop.  And Columbia i hate to say it is pretty pathetic as far as cities go.  I just don't think i'm cut out for Southern living is all.  

Lets see, last episode.  I just watched the one where Archer and.... the security officer?  forget his name right now.  (i haven't been watching it the last few months in favor of ER and movie marathons like all of the harry potters in a row ((in the same day. that shit took forever)) and all the x-men... lord of the rings... i've been on a movie marathon kick as of late)  Anyway. security officer and archer have to go down to this planet to find a scanner that either got stolen or left on the planet by accident.  They end up getting caught and suspected of spying by an opposite faction.  They're on a world that is pre-splitting the atom, and they totally make a mess of the whole situation.  Make the other side think they have high powered laser weapons, invisible ships, etc.  It was a lesson in not messing with non-advanced cultures.   Archer's beagle is great, though i have this fear that something bad happens to him.  I'm a Vet Tech in training, and i could just forsee such bad things happening to a dog in space. lol.     Also, i've seen Phlox in other things, but i just can never place where.  I don't want to IMDB it, in the hopes that i recall it midway through a random episode and go 'DOH!' 

I want one of those self made loft beds so i can save space and put a desk underneath.  Just haven't lived somewhere i can do it yet. I will though, no doubt about it.  

I don't drink, since it makes my anxiety worse.  It was never the novelty for me as it was for American kids though.  I spent my first 12 years in Europe sipping on beers and trying random Schnapps that people would let me sip on.  So i was pretty meh about it.

""Umm...why is this an outrage?""

""BECAUSE IT'S POLITICAL CORRECTNESS GONE MAD!""

This shouldn't even be a story! They used the world ""figure"" instead of ""Man"", so what? It *is* a figure! It's a little stick figure which has been designed by some engineers to be unambiguous in it's meaning of ""Walk"". Does it really matter if a Borough council in Middle England uses a de-gendered term for symbol?

Is it me or has ""political correctness gone mad"" become a byphrase for ""I am mortally offended by this small thing this person/group said or did because I am overly conservative and easily outraged""? I mean ""Political correctness gone mad"" does exist, stories involving groups assuming offence from something pop up every month or so. But about 80-90% of these ""PCGN"" stories aren't even stories, they're basically articles telling you to be offended by the fact a bakery called a a piece of Human shaped confectionery a ""Gingerbread person"". So what? It's a piece of Gingerbread, it's delicious! I'm supposed to eat it, not speculate about it's gender! 

The same thing happens when it comes to stories where a group acknowledges the existence of a group considered to be outside the norm. For example, A police service releases guidelines on how to deal with transgender people, and certain newspapers and blogs scream ""WHAT, HOW DARE THEY DO THIS, IT'S POLITICAL CORRECTNESSyadayadayada you get the idea"". This is completely reasonable, transgender people are one of the most vulnerable groups in Britain. They are more likely to be attacked than most groups in this country. Not too long ago a group of teenagers raided the home of a transwoman and beat her and her mother up. What are we supposed to do, deny they exist like we deny the fact members of our Royal family supported the Nazis? Hang on, Denial of the existence a group because of the prejudices of another. Where does that [sound familiar](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Section_28)?

If this pissy little council changes those due to pressure from this little Circlejeck of a newspaper, then I'm writing them angry letters about how doing so is PCGM because you are ""trying not to offend daily mail readers"".

But all of these things aren't really *rules*. More like...*guidelines*. Because he went back in his timestream in *Father's Day*. Mind you, it *did* cause a paradox that started eating stuff up... And a fixed point was breached once and that blew up the universe.

So really, it's not that you *can't* do these things, but you really really shouldn't because something important will break.

I'm a military brat.  I'm not 'from' anywhere.  For a rundown though... lets see...
I was born in Florida
Moved to Germany at age 3months or there about
Moved back to Florida at age 5
moved back to Germany at age 6
moved to Italy when i was 9
Moved to Idaho when i was 12
Moved to Ohio when i was 15
Moved to California when i was 20? 21?
Moved to Nebraska when i was 23ish
And moved to S. Carolina at 25.  (technically four days before that, but who's counting really? xD)

Five years was the longest i've stayed any one place.  There were several bases in Germany. And i lived in two places in Ohio.  I had three HS's my sophomore year &gt;.&lt;  it was... difficult to say the least.  I wish i could have been one of those kids that grew up in the same town knowing the same people sometimes.  But then i remember how we used to drive down one side of the Rhine River and random castles would just come up out of nowhere.  All of our vacations centered around awesome castles, beer fests, Christmas festivals.  One thanksgiving we spent in Rome and had Mcdonalds for dinner because we hadn't seen one in years.    I loved it, and i miss it.  I think i stayed in Europe too long, because i've grown to really hate the USA.

Here in Canada there's [""The Debaters""](http://www.cbc.ca/thedebaters/) (ninja link edit) on CBC Radio One.  Not quite the same (and rarely British comedians), but the closest thing Canada has to QI.  Replace quiz panel with one one one 15 minute debate, but points for facts+funny. EDIT: But no podcasts? They're trying to sell it on iTunes... frustrating.

As far as I can tell there is no ""Quiz Comedy"" this side of the pond.  I'd love to see more of the genre here but I'm not sure our comedians are up for it.  Quiz shows went out of fashion generally here in the 70s.

BBC's ""Museum of Curiosity"" was fairly good, but leaning more towards the knowledge rather than comedy.  Bill Bailey was in the early seasons.

They're trying to beat the dhabawallahs at their own game by racing lunches into town in their cars as opposed to the trains, as if speeding through the streets of Mumbai was a laughing matter. it is not-so-subtly racist, colonialist, and mind-numbingly unfunny humour. I hate it.

I really dislike what most people consider ""entertainment,"" in books, film, theatre, and television; It's a distraction, more than simply a departure from reality but a willful avoidance of it, and a waste of fucking time.

Car ownership is expensive, but there you go.  Got to get taxes from somewhere.  The railway and other public transport should get a good chunk of these taxes.  Sadly it's mismanaged and corrupt, but the better the public transport network, the better it is for everyone.

From that document:

&gt; Taxes and charges are only part of the overall cost of motoring. Although some 
motoring taxes have risen, the overall cost of motoring has declined substantially over the 
past 20 years. RAC research has shown that: 
[…] despite the perception, the cost of motoring in real terms has fallen, even when 
rising fuel prices were taken into account. In real terms, we found it is 18% cheaper 
to buy and run a car (comprising service and repair costs, insurance, road tax and 
breakdown cover), including fuel costs, in 2008 than it was in 1988.
28

So maybe we should put taxes up a bit more too.

Lydon's parents are Irish and experienced the anti Irish culture.

So if anyone is tempted to answer the question it was probably cos the English didn't seem to like the Irish.

Well that's what Johnny says.

It may not have been just  Thatcher, the Labour Party that was in Government from 1964 to 1970 and 1974 to 1979.

The policies were hardly all her policies and it was Labour who cocked up NI Premiers Terrence O'Neill's efforts to tackle sectarian issues in the mid 1960's and be friendly with the South and the Civil Rights Movement mess was theirs too..

Was there an anti-irish culture in Britain that was not limited to the Tories but existed in the Labour Party, the football terraces and in the streets.

I mean women, yes, but I was extending the issue to general ""(S)he should have done X and Y wouldn't have happened"" scenarios which I'm sure I don't have to detail to you, but for others: ""Well if she does wear a short skirt like that then she's going to get attention"".    
Yes, it does happen to men too, but in those cases it doesn't usually involve something that is specifically to do with their sex. A mugging, for example, might get the reaction: ""Well what was he doing in X street at Y time?! Idiot."" which would have nothing to do with whether or not they're showing a bit of leg.     
Although men are subject to sexual assault and the number is (probably much) higher than is reported, I doubt very much that the first thing that comes to most peoples' mind if they hear a man has been (sexually) attacked is ""What was he wearing?""    
Even on something like facebook, a man is unlikely to get illicit messages after having appeared on a TV show like this.

I realise the situation here (facebook attention) is somewhat different to a sexual assault, but the resulting responses to such a scenario can be very similar if not the same: The onus is often on the victim to have somehow averted the attention, rather than acknowledging that the mistake/wrong doing is entirely the fault of the perpetrator. 

Back to the idea of ""She should not have worn X"" etc.: When you factor in the statistics with regards to sexual assault - such as whether or  not the victim was known to the attacker, where the attack occurred and what attackers 'look for' when it comes to selecting a victim - the idea of blaming the victim in any way becomes even more absurd. For example, women who dress in a casual/dowdy way are perceived as being submissive and therefore less likely to struggle, compared to a woman who dresses in a 'confident' manner.

In my opinion the place where you are brought up or lived the most of your life determines your accent more than your religion. E.g. a protestant who was brought up in a primarily catholic village is more likely to speak with the accent of that village.

What I find interesting is the variation in accents between places which lie in close proximity to each other. This [map](http://maps.google.co.uk/?ll=54.954751,-6.465454&amp;spn=0.228292,0.617294&amp;t=m&amp;vpsrc=6&amp;z=11) shows a lot of towns villages which lie between the Counties Antrim and (London)Derry. Although the distances between these settlements is not great (maybe 5 to 10 miles between each one); a local person will hear differences in accents from one village/town to the next. I wouldn't expect a visitor like yourself to spot these differences. My uncle was from one of these villages and emigrated to Australia in the late sixties. He still comes back regularly and finds the variation in accents most amusing, given that in Australia you could travel a thousand miles and not find any variation in accents whereas in NI it changes every few miles.

Most of the villages/towns in that map could be labelled as being either predominantly Catholic or Protestant, but that should not be taken as a sweeping generalisation. The reality is that its not as black and white as that. E.g. Rasharkin and Kilrea might be labelled as Catholic areas, but there are Protestants (farmers etc.) who live in, around and between the two areas. Some might label Garvagh as a Protestant town but I'm sure others could deliver a sound argument on the legacy of Catholic families in the area.

Something to consider is whether or not you would 'muse' the same thing if a man was sent a rude message on facebook, or if a man was sexually assaulted. I assume you're specifically meaning the facebook issue when you say that, but people do say the same thing about women being attacked 'because of' what they were wearing.

The difference is that most people would not see a man as doing anything 'dangerous' in, say, wearing short shorts wandering down a road late at night, whereas they might frown on a woman doing the same thing: ""She's asking for trouble."" (note: I do **not** mean that she's asking for it in a 'begging for sex' type way, it's simply a figure of speech). As such there's a double standard applied between the two sexes, even though they are taking the same (apparent lack of) precautions.

As such your front door/Venezuela example isn't universal and would only apply to one particular sex of homeowner.

It's a fine line and I can understand how people would have trouble with it, but just because someone can reduce their risk of being attacked doesn't mean they should *have* to or be penalised, even if just in hindsight conversation, when something does happen.

I too am from Mid Ulster like your friends. 10 miles away from me in Castledawson/Magherafelt you will hear a vastly different accent to people in Cookstown. Then, if you were to go even a mile or 2 outside Cookstown into the country and speak to an old farmer, you would hear what sounds like a foreign language!!
There are other factors which might influence an individuals accent within a certain area. My accent for example is fucked up beyond belief lol. My Dad was from South Belfast and my Mum is from Edinburgh. So although I was brought up in Cookstown, the parental influence meant my accent was 'different'.

true,Gessekai,flair8,,"Rafa's goal was a brilliant goal, even if it was a lucky goal as well. Benny had a sparkling moment that set it up.

But, to be honest, we were the next best team out there. We did not have much attacking play going, and Swansea were doing a brilliant job throughout the first half.

I must say that I'm a bit surprised at how bad we were playing most of the time. If I'll have to name a MotM from the first half, it's got to be Friedel, with Sandro as close second.

Sandro makes a few bad passes, and it annoys me. Ade is offside quite a bit today as well, he was offside like 10 times against Norwich. Modric is almost non-existant in the build-up play, even though he really tries. Our back four has been looking shaky, with the centre backs doing some crucial interceptions now and then. Walker has not been his usual self, he can't take his man (credd to the Swansea defender) and fires the crosses way too hard. Parker is a wee bit injured?

There was only one or two good moments for us yids in the whole of the first half, and luckily we were able to capitalise on one of those. Hopefully we will come out into the second half and better ourselves, but I'm not confident that it will happen. I think it looks to be a draw unless we shape up.

**Edit:** I'm glad to read that some of us yids have better views on our playing this afternoon.

Simple enough task?

Just get permission to buy the carriages, go back to Siemens and purchase them, they're built and in service within the next two years.

No.

By the time the DFT had derped about for years and they finally got permission to extend the trains, Siemens had closed the production line down. The diesel engines used on the trains no longer met the new European emissions standards and were out of production. So the extension programme was scrapped.

It's pretty difficult to argue against increasing detection rates for sexual offences, but there are two things that bother me about this, and I'd like to hear other thoughts on the matter. 

The first concern I have is the use of a polygraph at all. How useful is the data they provide? I know that I for one purely out of nerves would sweat gallons, have a racing heartbeat, a shaky voice and probably shit myself if questioned on simple arithmetic while connected to such a device, never mind being questioned about a serious crime even if I hadn't done anything wrong. 

The quote from someone who used to be in the British Polygraph Association is ""If they polygraph six people and they get five truthful results and one deceptive, they can home in on that person"" Really? To me this raises further ethical issues, which bring me onto my second point.

Why is this being trialled on sex offenders? Is it because as I mentioned above it's hard to argue against the potential to increase detection rates for emotive crimes? Where does it lead if the trials are successful? Why not test people on the way to the pub to see if they plan on driving home after two beers rather than one? 

What are the safeguards?

evidence of Mr Guy, the journalist, supported by Mr Evra.""

Page 24 - Outlines why they reached a verdict based on ""balance of probability"" rather than judging whether he was guilty ""beyond all reasonable doubts""

Page 69- ""It seemed to us that Mr Evra's understanding of the Spanish word ""negro"" was influenced
by his knowledge of Italian. In his interview with the FA on 20 October, Mr Evra said that
he thought ""nero"" meant ""black"", whereas ""negro"" meant ""nigger"". This was what he
thought from his knowledge of Italian, and he went away to check the position in Spanish.
However, he did say in that same interview that it was still unacceptable to be told that
you had been kicked because you were black. The expert witnesses told us that the
Spanish word ""negro"" cannot simply be translated as ""nigger"".""

Even in his chapter about time travel and wormholes, he doesn't actually talk about those. Just talks about relativity and the remote possibility that some theory might possibly provide such a mechanism.

---

That is not sci-fi at all. You can actually learn something meaningful from it.

---

In comparison, Michio Kaku barely goes into any actual science in his book. There are the topics he covers in Physics of the Impossible:

* Force Fields
* Invisibility
* Energy Weapons
* Teleportation
* Telepathy
* Psychokinesis
* Robots
* UFOs &amp; Aliens
* Space Travel (including Faster Than Light travel)
* Parallel &amp; Alternate Universes
* Time Travel
* Perpetual Motion Machines
* Precognition

---

Given, the book is mainly about where such concepts are physically possible. But it's a very useless book because most of his analysis is basically of the following forms:

""No physics theory prevents this from happening.""

""There might be a physics theory in the future that'll allow this to happen.""

""I don't really want to talk about the Physics of this, so I'll talk about whether it's economically feasible. And no it isn't feasible right now. But, I am sure it will be in the future.""

And sometimes, he just cops out by taking a specific concept, and cheat with it to make it possible with Physics. Even though the colloquially understood concept is not possible.

---

I have a friend who would always call him self British, he would nearly take offence if you were to call him Irish. Then we were over at Download Festival a few years ago and we fell in with a group of English ones who would always call us Irish, as we were introduced to more of their group they would always say ""these are the guys from Ireland we were talking about"". My friend never once mentioned that he was British, I think he actually reveled in the fact they were calling us Irish, purely for the fact he could dig them about being English, while they were digging us about being drunk Irish men.

I can't really explain it that well, but Jason Manford done a joke about it a while back were he said if two people from Manchester and Liverpool met, they would be having a go at each for being from their respective region, but then if a Londoner was to come along, the Manc and Scouse would join together and dig the Londoner for being Southern. Or something along those lines, anyway. That's what I always thought my friend was doing when we were talking to the English group, if he was to call himself British he couldn't dig them for being English, so he didn't mind being called Irish. Then again, this is the same same guy who is has been going out with a Catholic girl for the past 3 or 4 years, says there is no god but yet wants his children to be raised Protestant, so fuck knows what's going through his head!

Me? I'd call myself ""A Citizen of the World"" if it didn't incite such funny looks from people. I pay allegiance to no government, and I certainly won't defend some colours on a piece of fabric. If you were to hold a gun to my head I'd call myself Northern Irish, but at the same time I wouldn't fall out with you if you were to call me Irish or British, because at the end of the day, what does it really fucking matter.

This could be interpreted in a variety of ways, and I (a fluent, daily Spanish speaker who lives in Gibraltar) agree with the experts. In context, it can be offensive (which all parties, including Suarez agreed). That isn't what hurts him the most, though. Dirk Kuyt statement to the referee after the match claims that he heard the phrase ""Porque tu es negro"", which means ""because you *are* black"". Kenny Daglish and Damien Comelli also stated to the referee, that Luis had told him he had said, ""because you are black"". This fits closer to Evra's version of events.

I still find it ambiguous, but reasonable doubt is not the evidence standard here. I think that the FA did due diligence in their investigation and Suarez will find grounds for an appeal difficult.

People said he gave the ball away a bunch, but it's probably just exaggerated in their mind because one of them was a really bad pass. He was actually really not any more wasteful than our other midfield/attack.

I do think his performance against Chelsea was a little better, but he was certainly our best midfielder today too. So excited about this guy...his potential is incredible.

Johnson-Carra-Skrtel-Enrique

--------------Agger-------------
