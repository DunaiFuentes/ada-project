First off, to sweeten the medicine, I'm really glad I was born British.  I think in general we're good people, with an interesting and often pleasant personality, who've created a worthwhile culture and hit well above our weight in world history (though I think we often delude ourselves quite how much is 100% our own work).

Okay, now the bad news.  I left the UK for a number of reasons, most of which were not economic.  I got tired of having discussions with little Englanders in pubs about how Great Britain is being sold out and losing her heritage, their thinly veiled racism and small minded petty bigotry about the world beyond the UK's borders (most of these types have singularly failed to experience anything of the world beyond two weeks annual holiday in Spain or Florida or similar).  I got tired of being squeezed into a tiny box-like house in an increasingly scruffy suburbia with shit-stained streets and almost no sense of community - there's definitely a sense of fading glory about the UK but it's for none of the reasons the little Englanders profess.  I got tired of increasing levels of random violence.  I got tired of the endless obsession with petty rules and regulations and micromanagement of my lifestyle, and people getting outraged and offended about the small shit whilst ignoring the many elephants in the room.  I got tired of the increasing levels of surveillance which did nothing to make me feel safer, just more like a creature in a zoo.  If I'm honest I probably got tired of the weather too, though there's a bit of irony attached to that as you'll see below.

OK, so what do I miss having been away for a decade or more?  I miss the countryside more than I can say, I miss having a large hound and wandering for miles and miles on a summer Sunday and rounding it off with a beer or two at a country pub.

true,TX1138,pertwee,Pertwee,"&gt;His resolutions are lazy and riddled with contradictions

If this was in any way going to 'kill this show' as you claim, then it already would have under RTD's time, whose resolutions were almost always pulled out of his backside at the last second, often completely killing any of the tension built up over the episode. I'm specifically referring to scenes like Pete/Mickey/Jackie being able to teleport just in time to save Rose/Sarah Jane from the Void/Daleks, God!Rose, the MagicVoidVacuum™, Floaty-Glowing Messiah Doctor, the Doctor-Donna's 'magical keyboard' solution to the Reality Bomb that serves only to reduce both Davros and the Daleks to a laughing stock, Donna's unintentionally hilarious mind-explosion powers that adds nothing to the plot and raises a huge number of safety concerns, and the previously unhinted-at third target that allows the plot to resolve itself without the Doctor being forced to make any moral judgement call whatsoever from *The End of Time* are all symptoms of a writer who again and again has proved himself unable to produce a satisfactory resolution.

Claims that Moffat's resolutions are in any way 'lazy' are just silly. I'd argue that Moffat tends to lays out a strong, cohesive plot, with elements that all tie together in order to create a satisfying resolution. For instance, A Christmas Carol sets out a number of key plot points;

* There is crippled Star Cruiser that needs saving from dangerous fog.
* The planet is inhabited by fish that swim in this fog.
* There is a flying shark that has swallowed part of the Doctor's sonic.
* The fog is controlled by Kazran's weather machine using sonic waves.
* Abigail's singing resonates with the ice-crystals that make up the fog.

All these parts, entertaining in their own right, go on to form the resolution to the story. I'd argue that the solution to the universe collapsing at the end of Series 5 was a bit out of left-field and could have used a bit more foreshadowing, but I have absolutely no problems with the resolution to the Doctor's 'death' at the end of Series 6. There was plenty of foreshadowing, had a place in the narrative *prior* to its use as the solution, slotted in well with the recurring themes throughout the season and made perfect sense in the greater context of the narrative. I'd probably argue that it's the *best* finale resolution since the revival.

&gt;The only way you can be ""surprised"" by a reveal in Series 5 or 6 is if you have the mind of a six year old or are just incredibly stupid.

And the only way someone could criticise Moffat for being 'unsubtle', 'lazy', writing 'sub-par' stories, and claiming that these things will 'kill the series' when RTD, the man who brought the show to unprecedented levels of popularity, is equally guilty of these traits (if not more so) is if they were lying to themselves.",0,1321775615,null,0,false,0,c319rq2,t3_miovs,t1_c319rq2,t1_c3198bb,1427903358,0,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,0

Well, for a time it *didn't*, as River's unwillingness to kill the Doctor was able to override the suit controls, resulting in the fractured reality. A truly brainwashed River wouldn't have resisted, allowing the deed to be done problem-free.

&gt;The whole 'The Silence being a religious organization trying to kill the Doctor' was stupid, and the organization really ruined the incredible monsters and made a shitty villain.

Really? Quite frankly I was glad to learn that they weren't yet another 'evil' monster being evil because that's what monsters do, like any number of other Doctor Who villains. Giving them an actual motivation made them interesting, and allows for them to return in the future without the need for another pointless 'invasion' plot that has been done to death throughout the series.

true,strolls,null,null,"My biggest problem with her is how she sold off our council houses (though I think she was responsible for some nasty civil liberties stuff, too).

[At one time in the 1970s, 1/3 of the population lived in council houses](http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b0109dvs) - she sold off a *huge* national resource and reaped short-term political gain from it.

I really don't think many people appreciate the social consequences of this, and I'm certain no-one understood the implications at the time. But everyone went along with it, because tenants wanted to ""own their own homes"" and politicians saw that they'd benefit from enabling that. A profit motive all round, basically.

Having such a large number of council houses, homing such a large percentage of the population, ensured that there were council homes for ""everyone"" - young couples, even single people, but most importantly many employed alongside the unemployed, the disabled and the otherwise marginalised and needy. 

The council houses in all in the better areas have now all been sold off, and those that remain are all in the worst ghettoes. Effectively, we've moved all the working people off our council estates, and I think we've lost a lot socially by that.

If you were a teenager living on a council estate 3 decades ago - even if you had fuck all else, a shitty education and no job, at least in the 70s you could aspire to a council house. Meanwhile, your neighbours might have been nurses, car mechanics, wielders but even if they were just factory workers, at least you could look at them and see they had jobs. That gave the opportunity for someone who's on the dole long-term to see their mates and people they went to school with and say ""Dave bought a new car the other week, because he has a job"" - the incentive to work was present and apparent amongst their peers. Meanwhile you might hear from a neighbour that the local plant is taking on some trainees. Alongside these carrots was the stick of the social shame or stigma of being one of the people on the estate who *didn't* have a job, of being someone who has *never* had a job.

I think that council estates back then gave a relatively healthy social mix - the current situation is that a far greater proportion of people living on them are ""scrounging chavs"" and living only around people of the same socio-economic class leads to social-reinforcement of their worldview, of their lack of hope and of their dislike of authority.

So now we live in a world in which everyone who bought a council house under Thatcher has made coin out of that, sold it for 6x what they paid for it and are now living somewhere much nicer, with a secure retirement. Meanwhile the middle-classes have bought second homes and are living off the rent, and the young can't afford their own places. IMO Thatcher had a massive influence on the fucked-up situation we're still in today. ",0,1321776722,null,0,true,0,c319uzm,t3_mi4m5,t1_c319uzm,t3_mi4m5,1427903410,19,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,19

This discount was calculated because they'd paid the council rent for years, but that money had long been spent. So the purchase price, on its own, would not have been sufficient to replenish the housing stock.

I understand what you're trying to say about another Doctor escape happening that we were just unable to see, but they made a huge point about the Pandorica being inescapable and the perfect prison. If the Doctor was able to escape from this on his own, that would have been a much bugger deal than Rory coming back and opening it for him. 

&gt;Because right after he did so, he gave Rory the sonic to get him out in the first place. Thus, the original escape gets wiped from time, so to speak, and is replaced by the Rory-with-the-sonic version.

We see the Doctor giving Rory the screwdriver later on from his perspective in the museum wearing the fez and holding the mop. Since we see the moment that Rory is given the screwdriver, it doesn't really allow for another time that Rory is given the screwdriver. And it implies that he had to go back at that exact moment because that's how he appeared to Rory.

Also in Time Crash, when Ten knows what to do because he saw himself doing while he we Five, but since that is not a real episode, I don't know if that counts.

true,RanByMyGun,silence,Silence,"I think overall, Moffat has done a consistently better job than RTD. Series 1-4 to me seemed like a pattern of good episode, mediocre episode, two great episodes, bad episode, and then another few good to great with a bad mixed in. It was very hit or miss. Moffat is not as extreme in this case. Even his (relatively) ""bad""  episodes are still pretty entertaining. I'd say Moffat's lows are similar to RTD's mediums, while RTD's lows are ones we'd like to forget even exist (Fear Her, ugh). I think what frustrates me with Moffat's stories are that the good ones are amazing, and so when we are given a story that isn't as good, it's frustrating because we know what the show is capable of.

&gt;I'm specifically referring to scenes like Pete/Mickey/Jackie being able to teleport just in time to save Rose/Sarah Jane from the Void/Daleks, God!Rose, the MagicVoidVacuum™, Floaty-Glowing Messiah Doctor, the Doctor-Donna's 'magical keyboard' solution to the Reality Bomb that serves only to reduce both Davros and the Daleks to a laughing stock, Donna's unintentionally hilarious mind-explosion powers that adds nothing to the plot and raises a huge number of safety concerns, and the previously unhinted-at third target that allows the plot to resolve itself without the Doctor being forced to make any moral judgement call whatsoever from The End of Time are all symptoms of a writer who again and again has proved himself unable to produce a satisfactory resolution.

I agree with you on Floaty-Glowing Messiah Doctor (which I still don't understand), the Doctor-Donna's 'magical keyboard' solution, and Donna's unintentionally hilarious mind-explosion powers. The Torchwood time lock is another thing that comes to mind that just pops out of nowhere. And not only were these out of nowhere, but it reduced the seriousness of a major threat that had been looming the entire episode. 

However, in your other examples, I was perfectly okay with them. I don't think you need to have everything be foreshadowed or hinted at way ahead of time. Sometimes it works well, other times it doesn't. The times when it became an issue was when RTD had a greater goal than telling the story. But that's just me, I don't really look for that too much. You seem to have a deeper analysis of these episodes. 

My biggest issue with the finale in series 6 was that he raised such a huge question of how to prevent the doctor from dying, and although the Teselecta is able to pull off all of the technicalities involved with rescuing the doctor, it almost felt like a cop-out. The theory of a duplicate was probably the most common one thrown around throughout the series. To me personally, I expected more. It may have been the best resolution in terms of context, it seemed like the easy answer. Even if it had been Moffat's plan from the beginning,  considering the Teselecta was introduced halfway through the season, it didn't really feel like it. I guess in the end, after struggling with this problem of the doctor dying for the whole season, for it to be so predictable was a let down. Once I saw the Teselecta in TWORS, I was hoping for the rest of the episode that it wasn't the answer to the problem, but I was disappointed. 

At this point, I'm not even sure if what I'm typing is relevant anymore. It's 4 am. I should have slept hours ago and now I'm just rambling. ",0,1321791210,null,0,false,0,c31an39,t3_miovs,t1_c31an39,t1_c319rq2,1427903780,2,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,2

true,TX1138,pertwee,Pertwee,"I think the problem with the 'jigsaw-puzzle' plot resolution approach that Moffat employs is that it can be a little predictable, especially when the elements are stretched for 7 months over 13 episodes. In the example I used, the whole story was over in a single hour, giving little time for people to pause and reflect on the various elements and how they might form the resolution. I think it's likely that when people new to the show do series-long marathons in a sort space of time, their experience with Series 6 will be completely different to those of us who watched each episode as it aired.

The reason I think the Teselecta works as an effective resolution to the Doctor's death is mostly due to how formed a part of the ongoing themes present in Series 6. The whole River Song arc is more or less demonstrative of how travelling with the Doctor can be amazing for those he holds close, yet also extremely dangerous. The 11th Doctor era is very much focussed on the inherent problems of being a 1103-year old Time Lord who continuously fights evil through time and space; at some point your exploits may come back to bite you.

In the Silence and early River, we have the viewpoint that the Doctor is a dark warrior steeped in the blood of the innocent, who one day will fall out of the sky, tear down your world and disappear without a moments hesitation. For the Teselecta crew, his companions, friends and allies, he's a hero; a man who fights against injustice whenever and wherever it may be, always with the greater good in mind. 

It is these opposing views that form the basis of the conflicts that are present throughout Series 6. River was created to fight *against* the Doctor and to stop his rampage throughout time and space. The Teselecta was created to fight *with* the Doctor against the evil present throughout time and space. It is only suitable that the two would eventually clash, and fitting with *Doctor Who* tradition, good triumphs over evil.

We even get a scene in *Let's Kill Hitler* where the Doctor faces the Teselecta, and is forced for once to view his exploits through the eyes of an outsider. Despite knowing that River is likely to be the one who brings about his eventual death, he is unable to stand by and watch this women suffer at the hands of the Teselecta. It is this scene, among others, that forces him to realise the damage he is doing to others, which eventually leads him to fake his own death in order to escape this vicious, endless cycle of conflict.

In my view, Series 6 possesses the strongest recurring themes since Series 1 of  the 2005 revival. There are many more instances of the 'Good Man vs. Dark Warrior' theme present throughout the season, and at some point I'll get round to formulating a post that encompasses every last one, going into detail regarding their relevance to the series as a whole.

Series 6 definitely had some structural and narrative problems; it is not perfect by any means. But people who lambaste Moffat for being 'lazy' do both themselves and the writer a disservice, and would better direct their efforts towards actual problems as opposed to pathetic personal attacks on the man who works is arse off to provide them with year after year of amazing television.",0,1321795161,null,0,false,0,c31atfr,t3_miovs,t1_c31atfr,t1_c31an39,1427903862,2,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,2

Just to nickpick this point, River *can't* stop Time. What she did was go against a fix point, which made Time collapse in itself within the area of Earth. Hence Time happening all at once at one time.

Because the fixed point revolved around two subjects, the Doctor and River, and ended with the Doctor's death, the separation of those points created, metaphorically, magnetic poles. Pulling Time apart between them. When the Doctor and River touched, it brought Time back to how it should be, back to the fixed point, which was then resolved how it should have been (i.e. with the Teselecta Doctor being shot).",0,1321795515,null,0,false,0,c31au3w,t3_miovs,t1_c31au3w,t3_miovs,1427903872,1,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,1

The thing that does annoy me is the little Englanders who try to claim that we're losing our cultural identity.  What the hell does that mean?  I've previously asked someone, on Reddit, to explain to me what the English Identity is.  The person was competely unable to offer a coherent explanation.  

Once you dig a little more deeply, you tend to find that the people who lament the loss of the English Identity actually mean that they're scared about the amount of brown faces they see in the high street.

For many, the concept of being English is something to do with wintry afternoon walks and foaming pints of ale in a country pub, exactly as you've described.  They mourn its passing.  But guess what?  We still have it. It hasn't gone away.

In the scheme of things, we are nothing but the fortunate 'house slaves' who get to live off of the leftovers from the Master and share his house. 

But we are not powerless - the powerless ones are the people who go out in Syria or the Congo and face machine-guns and machetes so that the 1% can still live a life of luxury.

We have the power not only to improve the lives of the majority of the people in the West, but of the majority of the people in the world.

There are plenty of tourist web sites that will show you the main art galleries, museums and historic sites. Also check out ""The National Trust for Scotland"" as well as they have several properties in Edinburgh and

I never once said RTD was better or superior in any way, so bringing him into this was pointless and irrelevant. My argument had to do with Moffat's BLATANT LACK OF BEING SUBTLE. HE'S AS SUBTLE AS THIS ALL CAPITALIZED TEXT GRABBING YOUR ATTENTION.

But if you want to bring RTD into this:

1) RTD at the very least laid clues and hints as to what the end game of each Series was going to be. Bad Wolf, The Missing Planets, Torchwood, Saxon, etc. He put the answers to what the finale would be all over in plain sight without EVER focusing in on them and blatantly telling us, ""Hey see this? It's important. Remember this.""

Moffat? He went out of his way to MAKE SURE we all saw the cracks on the wall everywhere, instead of putting them off in the background everywhere where we could see a glimpse of it but never solely focusing in on them.

2) RTD's run on the show at the very least gave us fleshed out and detailed characters, whether they were likeable or not, he went out of his way to make sure we cared about the characters we should have and disliked the ones we should have hated. He also referenced the past 40-45 years of the show and maintained continuity.

Moffat? He pretty much said, ""Yeah fuck your 45+ years of continuity. This is MY show now. Guess what? MOAR RIVER SONG EVERY OTHER EPISODE. Likeable characters? LOL! Have The Doctor being a one-note 'this is cool now!' pony and everybody dies!"" He stripped away the danger of death which leaves nothing for our characters to be worried about anyway because somehow there's ways around even HUMAN companions dying. Hey! Why don't we just zoom in and grab Edric while we're at it since apparently death doesn't apply anymore. Only threat you have to worry about is being erased out of existence. And nobody will even remember you anyway! So it's even LESS impactful on the characters!


I could go on for about 5 more reasons why Moffat is killing this show, but I'm tired and football is on. You like your Moffat, I don't.

This is just one of many issues.

And playing like we have for the past 6 or 7 years isn't going to work in the future with the way football is going. It is going to be painful, but evolving to a new system has to be done. We can't bully teams with strength and power anymore. The players are too old for that, and technique and precision is what is required nowadays. 

Lampard doesn't have the quickness of feet, Drogba can't control the ball, we don't have any wingers, let alone any with pace, our right wing backs aren't good enough (Ivanovic can defend but isn't the best going forward, Bosingwa is just useless), Ashley Cole is losing his pace and needs to be replaced in 3 years max, Terry has no pace, and overall a lot of our players are just too old. 

You cannot fix that in one season. If we played with power and strength like the last few seasons we would get into the top four, but in the future it won't actually win us anything of note. Slowly evolving the system with players like Sturridge, Torres, Mata, Meireles, Luiz (needs to be less erratic but has the technique centre backs require today, like Pique), Ramires and some youth prospects is a good thing. But that list is not a whole team. Far from it. We need more players, and I suspect Abramovich will go out and buy some more in January, like last year. Everybody can see we need change.

Rant over. But it isn't entirely AVB's fault. We could play like we used to, pumping long balls up to Drogba, and just about be ok, but that won't work in the long term.

Also, as a current Uni student, I'm well aware of what my hall of residence does for initiations. They're entirely voluntary and people are warned that they should be prepared for the worst. We also try to make them somewhat fun.

It also goes without saying that they ('they' being a crass generalisation of supporters of this 'ban') also seem to be getting drinking games and initiations confused with each other. Ring of Fire is a far cry from drinking vomit and a hell of a lot more fun.

Fair enough, the more extreme initiations should be discouraged. A risk of life, limb or injury should always be taken seriously. Otherwise, I think that a ban would be a horribly imprecise restriction.

**The Good**

* Largely thanks to Maxi, we had some brilliant attacking moves through the middle of the pitch. We haven't seen this sort of play in some time, as Kuyt and Bellamy are far better at cutting inside than either Henderson or Downing.

* We negated Chelsea's explosive fullbacks by employing a counter attack strategy which sent players on attacking runs directly at Chelsea's exposed centre backs (something Arsenal also did to great effect). 

* Charlie Adam had a brilliant first half, applying constant pressure (but not foolishly lunging in) in the middle of pitch that disrupted Chelsea's transitions into attack. His passing was skillful and resourceful, without the sort of desperate, 60-yard attempts that have done nothing for us in this campaign.

**The Bad**

* Lucas resembled the proverbial decapitated fowl today. Several reckless tackles and looked itching for a fight. Thankfully, he quieted down in the second half and became a bit smarter on the ball, unfortunately...

* The pressure our midfielders were putting on the back four of Chelsea came to disastrous effect in the second half, as it meant that when Chelsea's midfielders did posses the ball, they had miles of space to run in to. That is always the worry of counter-attacking play and in that case it bit us in the ass. To be honest, a second goal could have came, as Chelsea's midfielders, given ages of time on the ball, created some great chances late on. 

**The Ugly**

* Our set-pieces were just atrocious, particularly Adam's corners. Considering his all-around effort (particularly the first half), I still think he had an above average game. Bellamy took a few corners later on, but they were of no improvement.

* Again, Andy Carroll had the touch of a rapist today. He only had half a dozen encounters with the ball, but all of them were dismal.",0,1321816627,null,0,false,0,c31csey,t3_mj249,t1_c31csey,t3_mj249,1427904850,5,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,5

It's a bit better stateside than over here, as many companies are currently of the impression that they may as well hire a contractor over keeping an in-house team, but groups are actively working to show them that that's wrong and things are turning around. Of course, software's also one of very few areas where a minimal financial investment, coupled with a good idea and a moderate-to-large time investment, can have huge financial returns. New jobs spring up all the time because of this, though each have their own amount of risk involved.

Definitely let me know if you come over for a visit (or longer), we can definitely meet up.

Most of the city's pretty good. A modicum of common sense and care is all you really need to stay safe, and most places you want to be aren't really worrisome.

There are a lot of cameras. Most importantly, there are many in areas where you wouldn't expect to see them. It's important to note that the vast majority of cameras over here are low-quality and high-visibility; they're more there to make people realize they're being watched and stop them from doing anything. Private buildings in America, on the other hand, have high-quality low-visibility cameras designed to catch people in the act. Not a huge jump in number of cameras, but a big change in purpose.

A bicycle is a great idea. It can be a little harrowing on the streets, as they don't all have a designated bike lane (read: most don't), but I know plenty of students who ride in, none of whom have had problems with traffic. Do make sure to lock it securely using quality cable or U-locks, preferably making sure to lock both tires (don't know why but people like to steal individual tires). Also invest in quality lights which can be removed for safekeeping, as you CAN and WILL be penalized if you ride at night (potentially in rain as well, not sure on that) without lights. And if you don't remove them, someone else might. Unattended valuables in any city is a no-no.

As far as other transport, I'd recommend against a car personally; buses work well around the city, and coaches, trains, or cheap-o-air flights are good for getting elsewhere. The car comes with insurance, licensing, and fuel costs, with fuel being the worst (expect around $7.00 per gallon after exchange rates).  I've also recently looked into licensing and have discovered that, as a student from the US, you're not allowed to simply drive over here, you need to apply for a provisional license after being here for six months, and then pass a driving test (which shouldn't be remarkably difficult but is a pain nonetheless).

true,mikeanthony80,null,null,"This will make me sound like a greedy fan, but two players alone won't fix it. Left back will be ok for a few years so that can be left alone, and if we're lucky van aanholt or bertrand can step up in future (although if I'm honest I don't think they will - squad player status only). Right back is a must fix. The dutch guy we've been going after for a while sounds ok (van der wiel) but there is a dearth of right back talent in the world right now, so that position is quite difficult to fill. Even Spain struggle to fill that position, pushing ramos out there. 

Alex will be sold. People say he is solid, and he mainly is. However AVB doesn't like him. There are rumblings from within the club that he is one of the worst and laziest trainers at the club. And he wouldn't work in a high line. We need a new CB with pace to go alongside Luiz in the long term (for when Terry retires).
We need a CM in the style of Modric. I see exactly what AVB was going after with him. Our midfield is too slow, predictable and monotonous. We rely too much on Mata to create something. Ramires needs to improve his touch, but he brings much needed pace to the side, so he'll stay. Lampard will become our Scholes. Romeu should be the long term DM, and Mikel is a good squad player. With McEachran rounding out the list, our central midfield only needs one player like Modric, but not necessarily Modric himself.

Our attacking midfield/wingers though are in desperate need of help. Malouda, Kalou, Anelka are not good enough. They're a combination of slow, plodding, too old or just plain incompetent. And they're not wingers anyway. We need a pacey, tricky player who can play out wide or in the middle. And we need two. If those three players go, we only need two replacements. Hazard and someone else would be nice, but I'm no scout, so I don't know who the best value for us would be. But I can see where in the team we need replacements. 

Finally Drogba needs to go. He's been great (overall) for us, but with him in the team the other players can't help but resort to long ball football. It won't work! His touch isn't good enough for passing football. Sturridge, Torres, Lukaku (although he needs a lot of work), and someone else would be ideal. That someone else I couldn't name. If we could combine one of those wingers/attacking midfielders with a striker, it would reduce the players we would need to get. Someone like a Neymar (but not him!) who can play up front, or wide, or behind the striker. Someone versatile.

To sum up this stupidly long rant, we need a first choice right back, a pacey young centre back who won't necessarily be first choice for a few years but will get quite a few games as Terry's fitness starts to get worse, a central midfielder like Modric who is tricky with good technique and who can create things, a winger/attacking midfielder like Hazard, and finally an attacking midfielder/winger/forward like Neymar (but not him!)

Eccleston, and especially Tennant and Smith have made fine Doctors. And that's the beauty of the Doctor, that through regeneration we get a new interpretation of an old character. Davies and Moffat aren't gods, but they get it right a lot more than wrong, and when they get it really right it's MAGICAL.

But a really wrong Doctor in a big budget movie could be disastrous. This is an opportunity to create something wonderful, perhaps a movie franchise that could be the greatest thing ever. 

I'm of the mind of casting a very talented but relatively unknown actor (as Tennant and Smith were, at least to us in the colonies) and letting that person create the movie Doctor, not shoving the Doctor into someone else's persona. That would be the danger with Rickman, who I think is wonderful, a character who is Alan Rickman and his established personality first, Doctor second.

The only established actor who is a) British and b) generic enough to not overshadow the Doctor but c) capable of fine acting and d) young enough to be appealing to the masses is Ewan MacGregor. Perhaps he could pull it off, and atone somewhat for participating in the travesties that were SW E1-3.

&gt;The McCrone report was a dossier written in 1974 by Professor Gavin McCrone, a leading government economist, for the Conservative UK government into the viability of an independent Scotland.

&gt;It was a document that could have changed the course of Scottish history. Nineteen pages long, Written in an elegant, understated academic hand by the leading Scottish economist Gavin McCrone, presented to the Cabinet office in April 1975 and subsequently buried in a Westminster vault for thirty years. It revealed how North Sea oil could have made an independent Scotland as prosperous as Switzerland.

&gt;An independent Scotland's budget surpluses as a result of the oil boom, wrote Professor McCrone, would be so large as to be ""embarrassing"".

&gt;Scotland's currency ""would become the hardest in Europe, with the exception perhaps of the Norwegian Kronor.""

&gt;The report concluded that North sea oil revenue would have given an independent Scotland one of the strongest currencies in Europe and a large tax surplus. It went on to say that officials advised government ministers on how to take ""the wind out of the SNP sails"". The incoming Labour administration classified the document as secret over fears it could give a further boost to the SNP's policy of Scottish independence.

&gt;The dossier came to light in 2005 when the SNP obtained the report under the Freedom of Information Act 2000.

true,TX1138,pertwee,Pertwee,"&gt;[RTD] also referenced the past 40-45 years of the show and maintained continuity. [Moffat said] yeah fuck your 45+ years of continuity. This is MY show now.

This is a blatent *lie*. There are plenty of references to the classic era in the Moffat era; more so than what we got under RTD. Hell, six seconds into his era we get a reference to Pertwee, which has to be some sort of back-referencing record for a new showrunner. There are, however, less references to the RTD era, which given the overload of RTD characters in *Journey's End* and *The End of Time*, can only be a good thing.

&gt;Guess what? MOAR RIVER SONG EVERY OTHER EPISODE.

Replace 'River Song' with 'Rose', and again you'd have the RTD era down to a tee.

&gt; RTD at the very least laid clues and hints as to what the end game of each Series was going to be. Bad Wolf, The Missing Planets, Torchwood, Saxon, etc. He put the answers to what the finale would be all over in plain sight without EVER focusing in on them and blatantly telling us, ""Hey see this? It's important. Remember this.""

Are you being serious? RTD's Series 2 arc was completely-TORCHWOOD-in-TORCHWOOD-your-TORCHWOOD-face-TORCHWOOD-about-TORCHWOOD-it. And the Bad Wolf arc has to be the biggest let-down of the series so far. The words 'Bad Wolf' turned out to be just that; words! They had no real meaning or purpose beyond just happening to be the words closest to MagicGod!Rose™ when she sends them back in time. Coupled with Rose's ludicrous leap of logic when she somehow couples the words 'Bad Wolf' to 'I can somehow go forward in time to save the Doctor despite all evidence to the contrary', the resolution seems forced and contrived. The less said about its bizarre, in-your-face appearance at the end of Turn Left, the better.

&gt;He stripped away the danger of death which leaves nothing for our characters to be worried about anyway because somehow there's ways around even HUMAN companions dying. 

Again, RTD had just as much of a problem with 'death', and the show *exploded* under his run. Rose is going to die? NOPE JUST TRAPPED IN A CONVENIENT PLOT DEVICE WHICH SHE'LL LATER ESCAPE FROM WITH NO EXPLANATION. Donna is going to die? NOPE JUST HAD HER MEMORIES WIPED NOW SHE'S NO LONGER A USEFUL PLOT DEVICE. The Doctor is going to die? NOPE JUST GOING TO REGENERATE AND CONTINUE LIVING DESPITE RTD'S ATTEMPT TO CHARACTERISE IT OTHERWISE.

&gt;LOL! Have The Doctor being a one-note 'this is cool now!' pony""

It's worth remembering, to anyone who is thinking ""Well that should be OK if it's their religious conscience"", that a good many things, though socially unacceptable, could be justified in this way. For example there are passages in the bible that can be interpreted to mean women are inferior to men, black people are inferior to white and that interracial marriage is wrong.

If someone is allowed to refuse a legal service to another person due to their own ""religious conscience"" then surely any person can claim such a thing and use it to legitamise any sort of discrimination. I imagine there are people, even though they might be very few, who would very much want to discriminate against others for the reasons I give above, but society recognises their ""conscience"" as being unfavourable. Why we still allow it when it comes to something like the morning after pill I have no idea.

If the following isn't what you're implying, then ignore this reply: I have to assume from your comment you're implying that it doesn't matter that the Boots pharmacist refused the pill to the woman in question, because she could have gone elsewhere. I wonder would you be OK with a shop worker telling a black person to go elsewhere, because it is ""against my religious conscience to treat black people as equal"" or let's make it simpler: ""I will not speak to or deal with a woman customer, because women should be quiet and subservient [see 1 Tim 2:11-12. It doesn't matter that it's out of context] to men. Go away to another shop.""

If you can see the problem with those two examples, then you should see the problem here. Just because someone can get the service elsewhere doesn't mean that it should be legal to refuse someone. ""I don't like gays so won't serve them in my cafe - it doesn't matter because there's a perfectly good cafe over the road."" - No!

It couldn't be her just getting a monk on about it and plucking that excuse out of the air as she fumed about it at home deciding how to get it in the press? 

The pharmacist made a conscientious decision not to prescribe a drug they have a moral/religious/whatever problem with and they were within their rights not to. There is no law saying that it has to prescribed and there are laws in place to deal with the black/female refusal of service examples you trotted out. (BTW nice to see you didn't exclude anything about anti religious in your examples)

I don't have a problem with contraception/EHC or abortions (not a big fan of late term or use of surgical abortion as a sole form of contraception tbh) but I know that people do and amongst pharmacists (and doctors for that matter) there will be those that do yet put aside their beliefs and others that will not. Think of it like this, you get pro-war, ambivalent to war and  anti-war people. Within the last group are those that wont volunteer for service but will under a draft and a smaller number of true conscientious objectors that will not fight in any circumstances. I'd no more force them to fight than make somebody with a true conscientious problem with EHC prescribe it or for that matter force a Doctor to perform an abortion against their will.

Imagine if a Jewish butcher refused to sell pork because he believed that handling pork was immoral. In that case, everyone would agree that a butcher's religious interests are more important than the competing public interest, namely the ready availability of pork products.

The contraception issue is complicated by a number of factors. 

* The fact that we recognize access to health care as a human right to be balanced against the rights of pharmacists.
* The fact that we expect health care providers to be able to make difficult ethical decisions. We need ethical, conscientious doctors and pharmacists.

Do we really want doctors and pharmacists who are willing to follow orders that compromise their principles? Probably not. However, requiring pharmacists to sell the morning after pill means either that we must hire people willing to ethically compromise themselves, or that we refuse to employ certain pharmacists based on their religious beliefs.

Really? I've always felt that the 'Bad Wolf' arc was enormous let-down; all that build up for a simple predestination paradox was disappointing to say the least. 

The fact that it turned out that the words 'Bad Wolf' were just 'words' didn't help at all. They had no real meaning or purpose beyond just happening to be the words closest to MagicGod!Rose™ when she sends them back in time. Coupled with Rose's ludicrous leap of logic when she somehow connects the words 'Bad Wolf' to 'I can somehow go forward in time to save the Doctor despite all evidence to the contrary', the resolution seems forced and contrived.

Come to think of it, when Martha just tells everyone to think of the Doctor all at once at the end of Season 3, isn't that a bit bizarre? It isn't really explained how the Doctor can all of a sudden revert his aging process, fly toward the Master, deflect his Laser screwdriver, and completely subdue him. Was it still great to watch? I'd have to say yes. I just think it's a little weird.

In the end, though, Moffat's finales probably won't be what we remember him for. I think sometimes all of the lose ends laying about get away from him, and he can only close up a few of them with some crazy notions.

Let the free market work - raise interest rates to stop punishing everyone who isn't up to their neck in index-linked mortgage debt. Let people build their own houses instead of drip-feeding it via big builders who are looking to keep supply low. Let's have houses that cost a price that lets one person in the household work, just like the boomers had, so we don't have to be strangers to our children.

It seems to me that they both have their flaws when it comes to finales. it's not that either moffat or rtd is worse than the other at using deus ex machina, they both are guilty of this. The problems are that the really big arcs in moffat raise the expectation, so we get big stories and big problems throughout the entire series and it doesn't payoff. So even if the episode itself was pretty good it doesn't satisfy all the struggles and questions we had throughout the season. Since RTD didn't have the major arcs but just the little hints of something to come, we only had one real question each time, which would always be answered. Since we didn't have our expectations so high, the episodes felt really big. But his problems were that the solutions he came up with were usually pretty cheesy or ridiculous.

true,ljuki,sontaran,Sontaran,"Ahhh...I agree with OP in principle, but it's really difficult for me to criticize Moffat (or RTD, for that matter). 

Let me explain - I am a very tricky member of the audience to please because what I look for in TV shows/movies/books/etc is not necessarily action, or romance or flawless storylines. What I'm looking for in shows is the DRIVE TO KEEP WATCHING. I can't describe it any better than that, I'm afraid. Suffice it to say that I've given up on some very good, long-running series because after a while I've gotten jaded with them and wanted to move on to something new.

I've been watching Doctor Who for six seasons now and I'm still dying to see more. I've gone BACK to the classic episodes and I'm digging through the internet to watch every one I can find and I STILL haven't lost the drive to watch them, because the inertia that moves it which I got from the new series by RTD and Moffat is still there and strong. 

I would not wait for any other TV series for a whole year. No sirre, I would not. 

And because Moffat's and (and RTD's before him) Doctor Who has that DRIVE, because they are able to make me stick to the series like velcro regardless of how much I happen to dislike a companion who's in focus (cough-cough-River-cough), that alone is something to be cherished because I have only found that in TWO other series, one of which was also written by Moffat.

In other words - I am willing to forgive Moffat for a LOT, as long as he keeps bringing his magic to the series. I am willing to forgive plotholes and wibbly-wobbly explanations (hey, that's what suspense of disbelief is for!), I'm willing to forgive his enforcment of pet-characters who are Mary Sues, I'm even willing to forgive a weaker episode here and there because it's MOFFAT. He's got a je ne sais quoi that's become my drug now. xD

G. de Moreveau, in 1761 for the base in alum, which was positively shown in 1787 to be the oxide of a yet to be discovered metal. Finally, in 1807, Sir Humphrey Davy proposed that this still unknown metal be referred to as aluminum. This was then altered further to that of aluminium so to agree with the ""ium"" spelling that ended most of the elements. This is the spelling that is generally used throughout the world. That is, until the American Chemical Society in 1925 officially reverted the spelling back to aluminum, which is how it is normally spelled in the United States.

In the second half, his plan backfired, though and Chelsea's midfielders were left unmarked with acres of space to create and Charlie simply doesn't have the pace to transistion from tracking back in a deep position. Also in the second half, his passing was woeful (only completing 15 of 21) and if not for brilliant finishing from Johnson, it was by no means a spectacular pass that we should be in awe of. 

I don't say that to diminish his achievements,  but if our aspirations are top 4, I still am not convinced that he is the guy to get us there. Being our third highest scorer on 2 league goals is the worst justification, too.

That's a very interesting question, but completely theoretical as there is little to no competition in many of the areas you talked about. Airspace management as far as I'm aware is mainly run by NATS, licensed by the Civil Aviation Authority.

If refuse collection was opened up to the private sector directly then in terms of competition people could actually pay to have weekly collections as opposed to the fortnightly ones we have round where I live.

Certainly I'd say that in terms of quality of bins, schools, police, health care, tax, education, maintaining roads, parks and libraries here in Surrey I'm pretty convinced that ""What we get back"" is less than we put in.",0,1321884005,null,0,false,0,c31kcwd,t3_mk0qa,t1_c31kcwd,t1_c31k2ow,1427908931,5,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,5
true,widgetas,null,null,"&gt; It couldn't be her just getting a monk on about it and plucking that excuse out of the air as she fumed about it at home deciding how to get it in the press?

First of all: You're giving the impression that you think the lady in question *doesn't* have a right to be pissed off about this?! Blimey. Well all I can do is assure you that she has. 

It's perfectly possible that events conspired against her. It doesn't matter anyway: she could well have gone to another chemist and the ""I couldn't take it for 3 days angle"" could be left out entirely *but still* this would have been a major recurring issue.

She was refused a legal service from someone because *their* religion caused problems for *them*. It is not that person's place to inflict (for want of a better word) their religion on others.

&gt; decision not to prescribe a drug

The pharmacist in this case was dispensing, not prescribing. The lady had a prescription from her GP where the details and discussion over which was the best course of action would have taken place. The refusal of the pharmacist in this case is the moral equivalent of me blocking the shop doorway so the lady can't get in.

&gt;  There is no law...

I never said there was and if you read up the thread you'll see that I say ""Yep, it's the law at the moment, but it needs to change."" - This is the whole point of the debate.

&gt; (BTW nice to see you didn't exclude anything about anti religious in your examples)

Well seeing as the issue in question is concerning foisting ones own religion on someone, it's hard to bring about an example from the big-book of non-religion to describe a situation where someone says ""No sorry, it's against my non-religion to serve Christians between the ages of 50 and 60 if they are wearing a hat on a Tuesday."" Flippant, but it should be obvious. However, I should make it clear that the National Secular Society, of which I am an active member, campaigns for equal treatment of everyone regardless of religion or anything else. Take a moment to check out their website and you'll find recent articles concerning the unequal treatment of religious people that the NSS have got behind so as to protect their rights.

It's interesting that so many people seem to think that my taking a stance against a discriminatory religiously motivated action means that therefore I must be anti religion. When it comes to issues like this, I am primarily a secularist. I spend most of my free time on secular issues.

Considering that the link posted here is from the NSS website, I think it's worth you read the [*The Secular Charter*](http://www.secularism.org.uk/secularcharter.html). I'll make it easier: 

&gt; *3. All public and publicly-funded services must be non-discriminatory and non-religious [no proselytising or preaching or religious requirement to access services].*

&gt; *7. Religious beliefs, ideas, organisations and people shall not enjoy privileged protection from the right to freedom of expression.*

I'm not going to quibble as to whether or not a pharmacist is state funded or not when it comes to dispensing NHS prescriptions, I just wanted to make the point as to where the NSS, and I, are coming from.

&gt; there will be those that do yet put aside their beliefs and others that will not

And for those that don't, there needs to be a change in the law to protect those who want or require a legal service from being refused them.

&gt; than make somebody with a true conscientious problem with EHC prescribe it 

It's worth remembering that the EHC simply prevents pregnancy, rather than abort it. If the pharmacist in question has ever sold condoms then they are being hypocritical and we have to ask why.

&gt; or for that matter force a Doctor to perform an abortion against their will.

What if the doctor took their job *knowing* it would involve abortions? Having said that, I understand where you're coming from. However, if the doctor is the only doctor available for miles and miles and the lady in question needed an abortion or she would die - what then?

Suddenly it's not so clear cut an issue.

Given that a huge number of discriminatory views have in the past (and still now to an extent) been backed up or caused by religious belief, why are those morals OK (as I'm sure you'll agree) to be dictated to by the legal system/society, while others are not?

Also it's worth remembering that someone is still free to believe as they wish, but they simply cannot (or should not) be allowed to act on those beliefs if it encroaches on the rights of others. For example, a racist shop owner is *allowed* to be racist and have racist thoughts, but he/she cannot refuse to serve a black person simply because of their colour. They can still think racist thoughts as they serve them, but they *must* serve them. 

It's possible that some might say we're restricting an individual's freedom by not allowing them to practice their feelings that contraception/abortion is morally wrong by making them sell the items, but no-one is forcing the person selling them to use them. This is something that often gets overlooked: The religious person isn't being forced to *do* something immoral. Case in point is gay marriage: What I think is a major issue for religious people is that they think gay sex is a sin. If gay marriage is allowed then, as marriage gives the OK to sex, religious people are saying that gay sex is acceptable. Even though they aren't being forced to get gay married or have gay sex, they simply can't allow it to take place, even though it's none of their business. It's the same principle at work here.

true,widgetas,null,null,"&gt; providing help to a person in this position is actually mandated by most popular religions.

Indeed, there are lots of good people who are religious (I won't insult them by saying they are good *because* of their religion) who do charitable work.

However, often not without some sort of payment! There are numerous examples of religious charitable organisations [requiring recipients to pray](http://www.ncregister.com/blog/making-poor-people-pray/) or similar when they receive help, though I would imagine you're more likely to find this in the US than the UK.    
[Homeless shelter ousted after food was served before prayers.](http://thedailyprofaner.com/2008/12/30/church-evicts-homeless-shelter-for-not-making-starving-homeless-pray-before-christmas-dinner/)

[Check out #6 here](http://www.ehow.com/how_2302894_live-homeless.html) - It seems to be well established in some places.

While I am in no way attempting to tar all religious groups/bodies/charities with the same brush, it is not always the case that someone will be helped just because they are in need without some sort of clause. The Salvation Army, for example, is well known for being anti-gay. It appears that in the past [they have refused their services to people who are practicing gays](http://www.bilerico.com/2010/11/why_you_shouldnt_give_to_the_salvation_army.php), even right [after Hurricane Katrina.](http://www.rslevinson.com/gaylesissues/features/collect/newsnotes/bl_20050906_katrina_no_salvation.htm)

While it may seem like I'm religion bashing, my point is simply that there may often be some sort of clause behind the charity. Not always, by a long shot I think, but I bring this stuff up to partially excuse the lady in the article bringing up the methadone. I can envisage a homeless shelter refusing to help someone who is on heroin, or attempting to come off of it. I'm sure you can think of an example where someone is shunned by a family or congregation for doing something unacceptable and never forgiven by that group.",0,1321886159,null,0,false,0,c31kjl7,t3_mjh9m,t1_c31kjl7,t1_c31hex0,1427909027,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

true,glglglglgl,blue,Misfits playlist: now complete as far as possible,"The way it seems to work to me (and I haven't rewatched Seasons 1/2 for a while so working from memory), is that there is only one timeline.

The person who goes back and changes is aware of the change being made, but no-one else does. As TheGoddamnBatman mentions, after he fast-forwards back to the present, Curtis then has both sets of memories - the original timeline, and the timeline as it plays out with his changes. (This fits with even the short timejumps that don't finish with Curtis fast-forwarding: he remembers the events that he prevented as well as the new set of events.)

Let's ignore Future!Simon here, and say that he's wrong about the existence of multiple timelines, or rather that it's just a convenient way to talk about making changes to the one, singular timeline.

So as for this episode: when the old man travelled, he was the same conciousness in each timeline, aware of the Nazis both winning and losing the war. The other characters would have grown up always knowing that the Nazis won the war. When Kelly travelled back to get the phone, then zipped forward, she *should* have been the Nazi-winning-version but would also have the (new to her) memories of the Nazis losing the war and it can be assumed events with the Misfits played out as they did originally. She should have been disorientated at first (as the 'proper' timeline should have been new to her even with memories of it), but I don't see Kelly really thinking or worrying about it too much.

However there are still some inconsistencies: she should still have the Rocket Scientist power in the Nazis-losing timeline after she fast-forwarded into it (and it's possible to hold multiple powers), in addition to her new time-travel power. Also, the old man should still have been inexplicably stabbed at the war memorial, because he had to have gone back first for Hitler to get the phone that Kelly retrieved...

Thatcher won three elections and for different reasons. She was massively popular.

The selling of council homes for one was about working class people having their own stake in the nation, the chance to stand up and not be subject to the whims of a landlord or treated like children that had to be looked after. Ownership then leads on to independence and the individual making their own decisions rather than sitting at home waiting for the council to 'do something'. And people queued up to join this revolution.

Those industries that were taking huge subsidies were only putting off the day they went under. They simply wouldn't modernise and had a captive audience in Britain for many years forced to buy their output, and people outside the protected union jobs had huge taxes taken off them to pay high salaries to those inside the system. The thing is that these protected markets didn't help, but instead made them immensely complacent. 

People forget that you couldn't even own your own telephone, and more importantly people on this thread completely ignore globalisation and the opening up of markets (e.g. EU) that coincided with her time.

People also forget how run down and shabby Britian was. We still had bomb sites in London decades after the war had ended and whole areas around central London lay fallow.

Thatcher had the idea that anyone could start a business or get a role without it being handed to them through connections. No more being fixed in your place in the class system.

Importantly she killed the idea of managed decline, that it was inevitable that Britain would get poorer and poorer and become less and less important and that nothing could be done to stop it.

That's the only word I can think of for all those baying for AVB's blood. The first few matches that were won employed the high defensive line. I thought I saw quite a few posts that praised AVB's fresh new approach back then.

Now that the high line has failed for the last few matches (mainly because of a slow defense that isn't adapting well and a naive, impulsive curly haired someone I shall not name) we want him to go? Take a look at yesterday's starting line-up: Five(?) out of those eleven are thirty-plus years old and have slowed down considerably than they used to be.

You can't expect anyone (let alone an expensive manager) to start producing instant results - no matter how much you paid for him. There will be a period of transition. The old order needs to be replaced with the new OR you need to bring in quality players who will adapt to each other quickly. The first needs time, the other needs money - both of which are at a premium right now due to various reasons.

Look at Man City, they've made expensive acquisitions over the last few years but this year is the first time that they have managed to fire as a (almost) cohesive unit. Look at SAF, his first trophy came AFTER three years into his ManU career. Heck, his first league title came SEVEN years into his ManU job - in 1992-1993 - and they were 10 at the beginning of November '92.

How many Chelsea managers have been given that kind of a time-frame?

My point? It takes time and a certain amount of shrewd managerial acumen. The latter (I'm fairly sure) AVB has it, but the former, *we* need to give him. I haven't followed his coaching career too closely, I admit. However, whatever little we have seen of him, it is clear that he has the drive and the passion.

&lt;TL;DR&gt; The current CFC squad is a team in *transition*. I, for one, would not mind if Chelsea finished outside the top seven if it meant that AVB gets to keep his job and gets to make those all important calls about who stays and who goes. In fact, I find myself secretly wishing (at times) that Chelsea finish outside the top seven so that they don't have to worry about mid-week European matches which are clearly taking a toll on the players, the manager and everyone else.

&gt; the BBC wants the show to have wider appeal, which is the sentiment it voiced in the marketing of series 6.

Remember that marketing departments are separate from the production teams. BBC America and BBC Worldwide are more-or-less separate from the regular BBC, with different budgets and aims (additionally BBC Worldwide is entirely commercial, which the BBC isn't). BBC Worldwide/America may want *Doctor Who* to be their main show, but the BBC still has a duty to produce a show representing and for the UK. Over here, the marketing of the show has not significantly changed with Season 6.

Ok, I realize you weren't talking about London.  :)  Still, the entire [MET has about ~50,000 employees](http://www.mpa.gov.uk/statistics/police-numbers/).  That's covering a population much larger than simply London.  However, it's not even 1% of London and covers a greater area and population than London *and* includes many, many people whose sole job is to coordinate things with *non-MET* police agencies.

But 10% of people working for government is *huge*.  Think of a village of 10,000.  How many people does it take to repair roads, deliver post, police, provide NHS services, etc for 10k people?  Consider that 10k people is [approximately](http://www.communities.gov.uk/documents/statistics/pdf/1172133.pdf) 4,350 households.  So 10% would mean that nearly 1/4 of households are involved in government employment.  That's *astounding*.

And the data/map show that many, *many* places employ upwards of 30%!  That would make 3/4 of households in those places involved in government employment.

true,elapid,eng-Cornwall,Kernow,"As an ex-mortgage advisor I think the problem is more the cost of housing than the loan to value. Years ago it was possible for people to save a decent deposit and mortgage payments were a much smaller proportion of the borrowers income.

House values have risen to unrealistic levels in recent years which has been caused by lenders bumping up house values to enable homeowners to borrow more against them when they remortgage. It's a shame that there isn't a way of giving land a set value and basing the price of houses on the value of the land and rebuild cost rather than the fictional price that the surveyors have made up then increased by 10 to 20% at the request of the lender.

Our office would always phone the surveyor for a higher valuation if it was required and every single one would give at least 5%. In some cases we got them to up to 40% more. Many valuers would also do what's known as a drive by valuation where they literally drive past and have a 30 second look at the house from the road and take a quick picture.

I worked in sub-prime and highstreet. Sub-prime businesses were very strictly monitored by the FSA and every single thing had to be by the book as the FSA would take any opportunity to slap a fine on us.

Highstreet was a completely different story. They knew the FSA largely left them alone so they would lie about terms, conditions, fees even interest rates and early repayment charges. They would also try to distract customers from reading documentation before signing it so they didn't realise until it was too late. 

In Sub-prime we had to read out every single bit of paperwork and ensure that the customer was aware of it all and understood it. We had to record every conversation with clients and keep it on record so the FSA could listen to it.

While there were lots of problems with sub-prime mortgages you have to understand that many of those customers would have been repossessed by their previous lender and possibly forced into bankruptcy had they not taken the mortgage from the sub-prime lender. In many cases it seemed like were delaying the inevitable but it still gave them a fighting chance to sort themselves out. On many repossession cases I even waved my own commission or part of it if it meant that it put their mortgage within the affordability parameters.

true,punkfunkymonkey,null,null,"&gt;First of all: You're giving the impression that you think the lady in question doesn't have a right to be pissed off about this?! Blimey. Well all I can do is assure you that she has. 

I'm sure she is pissed off and has a right to be pissed off because she had to go elsewhere to get something. If she was in an isolated community she'd have more right to be pissed off. She has fuck all right to be pissed of because the chemist was willing to dispense methadone.   

&gt;The pharmacist in this case was dispensing, not prescribing. The lady had a prescription from her GP where the details and discussion over which was the best course of action would have taken place. The refusal of the pharmacist in this case is the moral equivalent of me blocking the shop doorway so the lady can't get in.

A prescription is not required for EHC and pharmacists need to ensure whatever a doctor prescribes won't interact with other medicines/be abused etc they don't just wipe their hands clean of responsibility just because somebody comes in with a prescription.  

&gt;It's worth remembering that the EHC simply prevents pregnancy, rather than abort it. If the pharmacist in question has ever sold condoms then they are being hypocritical and we have to ask why.


I'd say if you were to talk about them selling the standard pill you might have more of a case for hypocrisy. Condoms prevent the sperm and egg coming into contact with each other so whereas some people who are anti contraception have a problem with all methods others have a problem with anything that would interfere after the sperm has fertilised the egg in their eyes a valid form of life.

&gt;What if the doctor took their job knowing it would involve abortions?

How likely is that, there are plenty of things that a doctor can do that don't require that they perform terminations. Bear in mind there's a huge amount of drugs a chemist can sell that aren't related to contraception.

What if that chemist took their job before EHC was passed for use in the UK?


I'm seeing this case not as a 'I don't think anyone should because of my beliefs and I'm going to deliberately go out of my way to stop people ever...' but a 'My beliefs don't allow me to be part of this, you are more than welcome to do so as it's your choice but I can't in conscience be part of it '

I don't have a problem with EHC, I could care less whether it prevents fertilisation, aborts (and , I'd happily dispense it all things considered) but I'm aware that others do and I think laws forcing chemists to prescribe/dispense to against their moral beliefs when there is valid alternative (other chemists that will happily supply close by) smacks of fascism.

Series1 - Deux ex machina (literally and only just avoids being figuratively as well) to turn the daleks into pixie-dust

Series2 - A big lever that magically hoovers up an army of daleks and an army of cybermen

Series3 - Everybody wishes really hard, the doctor turns into tinkerbell, jack shoots something and then everything is back to normal

Series4 - This one I can't fault, it's built up and the strands for the resolution are laid out in the story, it takes a bit of effort, a solution doesn't just magically appear

Series5 - complicated, there's three barely related threats (everyone turning into the master, the invasion of gallifrey and the doctors death) while the last is dealt with well, the first two just go away with little more than a wave of the hand.

I don't want to look like I'm knocking RTD (I guess I am a bit) but I think the basic problem is that it's difficult to come up with a satisfactory resolution for ""The whole planet/galaxy/universe is in danger"" without resorting to a bit of the old magic button.

That's one of the things I liked about A christmas carol. It wasn't a big massive threat, it was just one ship in danger.

true,bluefold,null,null,"I think that he is brilliant at coming up with stories and ideas but he tries too much narrative bang into the last episodes. Quite often I have noticed that Moffats that there is no story in his finales. There is a lot of conclusions but very little in way of developments and quite unnaturally they will feel disconnected from the rest of the arc.

Example: the Big Bang - Nothing happens here. The Dr. Finds young Amy, Oh look Amy is alive, Dalek, Magic exposition time.

Example: the Wedding of River Song, Every narrative high point of this episode has already happened in episode 1. We have had a full series of hint and character development which is torn away by having Dr. The only one who knows what is going on and then having a magic exposition conclusion.

I am not saying that these are bad episodes but the do lack narrative cohesion. 

I wish that he would take up mid season episodes more often, prefereably stand alone episodes. He excells at self-contained complicated episodes but they are simply not stories you can tell over 2 episodes and he always flags with pacing when he does them. 

My solution: mix out who is writing the series openers and finales, mid season finale. He can still be the evil genius we all love and plan the long season arcs but mix up the writing styles of the episodes. Having one person penning the most important episodes of each series just makes it seem like the same voice all the time. Davis was just as guilty for this.

Give Matthew Graham the series opener and have Gatis do the midseason break as he is always good with the creep and bait then Moffat do the first episode back (along with a couple of stand alones) and share out the two finale episodes with two writers who don't mind working closely together.

Edit: This is exactly why I think the Timelords are coming back with Smith's departure. They have to rely on non-nonsensical finales because there is no one who can match the Dr. so to make everything seem more they blow up the universe and other things. Look at how many times he has hit the reset button of the Dalek production line during finales. Even his 'greatest enemy' tends to be nothing more than a minor inconvenience.

true,Tokei,tardis,TARDIS,"The problem isn't with Moffat, but with television in general.  Everyone wants the season finale to be this huge, amazing, just beautiful episode that is the pinnacle of amazing in a series.  It wasn't always like that, back during the original run of Doctor Who television wasn't like that.

But it is now.  It's a huge cultural change.  Go and watch any television series and you will always see that at the end of the season.  Huge episode with huge amounts of the season long plot arc being wrapped up, and, if there's a season after the break, threads left loose.  Supernatural does it, Buffy did it, NCIS does it, Game of Thrones does it, etc.  It's not limited to Doctor Who, or even just Moffat.  

I honestly kind of enjoy it, it's like watching a story come to an amazing conclusion (yep, even books do it!), but Moffat seems to be doing it in waves.  The Silence Arc has been ongoing for two seasons now, with maybe the end in sight.  Yes, it is annoying realizing that this is a giant plot line that has been three years in the making, but that can't be helped.  Sometimes you need something that's literally that huge.  In the first year of the arc (Series five), we didn't realize it until the TARDIS exploded.  A big bang of a series finale, but then we moved on.  During the second season we learned what the Silence were up to, and why, and also that River Song is a very determined woman.  Next year we get to see the Headless Monks fall, we get to see how the Silence is just as powerful as it is, and we may even get to see the Plains of Tranzelore.  A play in three parts, three acts, and a single plot line.  Stretched out over three years, with a conclusion that will most likely blow everything we've seen yet out of the water, and still allow for other writers to not need to write such big conclusions because the universe is currently forgetting the Doctor instead of fighting him.

Personally I've liked Moffat's finales.  There's always been a bit of magic about the old man, and that makes me sleep much happier at night than all the mathematical formulas in the world.",0,1321898572,null,0,false,0,c31m5x5,t3_mjuc0,t1_c31m5x5,t3_mjuc0,1427909792,3,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,3

true,Drugba,MN,mongolia,"Mourinho liked to play very defensive and score on counter attacks. He liked to let the other teams waste their energy in the midfeild trying to break us down and then attack once they had worn out. AVB plays almost the opposite system. He is very attack oriented pushing players very far forward (this seems to be the cause of a lot of our losses lately). He wants the players constantly moving and lots of possession. He expects very fast football and tries to use quick passes between players to pull the opposition out of formation and then exploit the gaps (For a really good example of this watch Torres assisted Sturridge goal against blackburn). 

The problem with this is it's not a system we have really played before. This causes problems because many of our players are aging and don't have the stamina or pace to play this type of game. Combine that with the fact that the core of our team is either left over from the Mourihno era, or have been taught to play that system, and we're trying to teach old dogs new tricks. 

Players that seem to fit AVBs system are players like Rameries. Players who can just run for 90 minutes and can keep possession. I think the player that fits the system the least would be Mikel, he has always been a very defensive player which goes against AVBs attack mentality, and he tends to be slow on the ball and keep possession too long",0,1321898661,null,0,false,0,c31m6fj,t3_mkbg4,t1_c31m6fj,t3_mkbg4,1427909805,6,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,6

true,widgetas,null,null,"&gt; She has fuck all right to be pissed of because the chemist was willing to dispense methadone.

She wasn't pissed off *because* of this. It was simply an example as to the apparently arbitrary morals of the pharmacist in question. Both customers had, according to the beliefs of some, done something wrong or were doing so.    
But that's somewhat beside the point and clouding the issue. She was angry because she was refused and perhaps raised the issue of methadone to point out that the pharmacist was happy to supply a heroin substitute but not someone wishing to avoid enlarging their family. We can't know *exactly* why she raised the methadone, she may well have a problem with (reforming) drug users, who knows? It's somewhat irrelevant to the overall issue. But why go down that route unless trying to show the customer in a bad light?

&gt; A prescription is not required for EHC and pharmacists need to ensure whatever a doctor prescribes won't interact with other medicines/be abused etc they don't just wipe their hands clean of responsibility just because somebody comes in with a prescription.

But she *did* have a prescription in this case and the pharmacist specifically said they wouldn't give the pill *because* of their religion.    
I know I'm repeating myself but it's not a hypothetical we're discussing here. Of course before a pharmacist hands over a prescription they will say something like ""You know you can't take X or Y with this?"" and do other checks. But outright refusal for a personal moral reason instead of a decent medically based issue? That's not on. What if the pharmacist had refused the methadone addict because drug users shouldn't be helped to control the issue with drugs? I'm sure there are religious people who think that way. Would it be acceptable for a pharmacist to refuse in that case? I don't think so.

&gt; How likely is that...

Again missing the point - We were talking about practitioners being put in a particular situation. Personally I find it incredibly unlikely a pharmacist can become a pharmacist without realising they would to dispense such medication. I believe versions of the EHC have been around in the UK for nearly 30 years (1984), but of course I'll agree that a pharmacist could have been working since before such drugs became legal.

&gt; 'My beliefs don't allow me to be part of this, you are more than welcome to do so as it's your choice but I can't in conscience be part of it '

But this doesn't fit with refusing when you're the only person in the shop! As such your first sentence "" 'I don't think anyone should...' "" is what is actually occurring. But in any case it amounts to the same thing.

With regards to your last paragraph:

&gt; I don't have a problem with EHC, I could care less whether it prevents fertilisation, aborts (and , I'd happily dispense it all things considered) but I'm aware that others do and I think laws forcing chemists to prescribe/dispense to against their moral beliefs when there is valid alternative (other chemists that will happily supply close by) smacks of fascism.

Surely it can be applied to any other moral issue:

&gt; I don't have a problem with gay people, I couldn't care less if they get married, have sex (and, I'd happily treat them like anyone else) but I'm aware that others do and I think laws forcing shop owners to treat gays equally against their moral beliefs when there is a valid alternative (other shop owners close by like gays) smacks of fascism.

true,[deleted],null,null,"I agree. For what its worth Luiz averages the most block shots per game, the most interceptions per game, the most offside won per game, and the most clearances per game. Neither of the goals yesterday were his fault, and terry has had probably the 3 worst games in a row he has had in ages. Slipping, missing tackles, out of position etc...Somehow this is all Luiz's fault. Against liverpool he made at most 3-4 forward runs, neither of which left us exposed at the back. 

Just before the goal yesterday Kuyt almost scored if anyone remembers. The play began like this...Henderson nutmegs ashley goal. Luckily our back line is there to cover. Terry charges in rashly (something Luiz would have been CRUCIFIED for) and misses the ball by a mile. Henderson goes around him and LP setup a play on goal. 

Here's how the second goal happened:

Liverpool harmlessly playing around with the ball on teh right side at the halfway line. Sturridge, Lampard, and Meireles are there applying medium pressure on the ball. Ivanovic is behind them guarding the flank.

Malouda at this point is literally WALKING back to his position despite the fact that Mata had moved over to the right side and was recovering so there is no LW at this point. 

Adam then plays the ball over to a wide open and surging johnson. At this point, while the ball is in the air. Luiz is tracking back in his position and also marking a liverpool player. Terry is 5 ft from him for some reason. Cole is about where terry should have been. Malouda begins lightly jogging back. Cole misses the tackle and they score. Terry had ran over (not a sprint by any means) to the back post instead of trying to cut off johnson. He knew he was out of position. Again, this is a simple position issue and not a pace or high line issue. 

How yesterdays loss continues to get blamed on Luiz I have no idea.

Fair enough, I took from your comments that it was something that you disliked about the show. As for average Americans, the show would simply have to be an American show if accents were a turn off. (I'm sure there are Brits who are similar.) The best way to get American audiences on board would be to have American companions (entirely plausible) and locales (I'm sure Cardiff has doubled up for the US before). Ideally also changing the format of the show - but that would remove part of the reason the show is loved. No-one can deny that American and British shows generally feel different, even if there's not a good way to explain why this is the case. There is no way that an American show would refrain from using slang understood across America^note, in order to milk a foreign market. It's a case of accepting it, or don't watch our show.

Oh, he says so many things, but you have a fair point there that the series runner was wanting to break the US.

Note: don't take that as anti-US sentiment.

But read the comments, and folks are making even more demands. And this is apparently from the Occupy London General Assembly, although it doesn't even say who this assembly is.

I'm not saying one is right, and one is wrong... just pointing out that there is a big difference, there is no consensus. Without a consensus, the media is free to pick and choose whatever image they want to portray since you can't prove them wrong.

As it is because the future of the Euro has been called into question  the UK bonds are still selling.  Doesn't mean the UK is in a good place, but it does mean it's proven being outside the Euro is a better place to be at the moment.  The UK has fiscal controls other European countries no longer have.

If any country can devalue its currency to offset its debt, which should make futures less attractive, and still see a growing demand in its bonds - that's a real result!

One of your most important proofs to your argument were the comparisons to the likes of ManCity and SAF's first years in charge. Without patience, Chelsea are lost; doomed to what we've been experiencing YEAR after YEAR after YEAR since Mourinho left. Yes you could argue that Ancelotti brought us the double in his first year in charge, but what happened when ""he"" didn't deliver in the second year? Straight to the executioner. 
When I think of a football club, I think of their history and their philosophy. Right now, the history and philosophy in the past 5 years  of this club is an absolute joke. Can't get the result you want all the time? Put a gash in the team and try to bandage it up. Changing managers EVERY year (roughly) results in changing tactics, new relationships within the entire club, including the new manager and any new players that are brought in.  It is a learning experience, and, as with the bandage metaphor I presented before, these things take time to heal and flourish. A new system and new players have been introduced into Chelsea FC this year and, although every one involved in this team wants glory and trophies, from the players to the fans, success will take time. I, for one, am willing to wait and hopefully experience in these coming years a dynasty at Chelsea, so we can truly compare ourselves to the Man United's, the Arsenal's of the world. Giving AVB's Chelsea 3 months is hardly a fair assessment of what he can produce as a manager and what his players can produce under him. This was a HUGE risk by Abramovich to bring in a manager like this, but surely he understood that, he's not completely mental!

true,handsomewolves,mccoy,McCoy,"the sixth series had pacing and episode placement problems. Personally i would have like to have seen the whole river's youth story played out a bit long (yes i know we have years that are still unaccounted for though). Also, i don't understand why after AGMGTW and LKH we didn't get ONE conversation between Amy and Rory about Melody and how they we're reacting to it. 

I want  to know about the threads from series 5 and i'm sure we'll get them in series 7. Hopefully the execution of the plot in 7 is better. While 6 had so many good idea it often fell short of the prize.

One thing i can think of is how some episodes where moved around in the schedule mosltly due to the mid-season break (i liked the idea of the break, since it gave us less time between episodes compared to how it used to be. But i didn't work out like that and now we have to wait even longer). The cliff hanger built things up and then was quickly resolved when the show came back, especially when you watch that mini prequel episode to LKH with the doctor listening to Amy leave him a voicemail.

I think it would have worked better had the episoded been in a better order. If for say it went something like:

NOTE: these don't really work if you were to watch them likes this due to how they were filmed.

* DoTM
* Night Terrors (we it was initially going to be run)
* The Doctors Wife
* Curse of the Black Spot (hopefully it could have been edited better, i guess the original must have ran longer and there are some glaring mistakes)
* tRF
* tIP
* AGMGTW
* tGWW (obviously doesn't work in the current events, but had the doctor picked them up again we could have had sweet convo's about melody and then when Amy gets red waterfalled she could have been really pissed off about her daughter)

That's a matter to take up with Boots then, if they don't hire religious types to cover the chance that some of them won't prescribe it won't be long untill discrimination lawsuits start rolling in. Ask them to not hire locums whose religion potentially means they have moral problems with EHC and again wait until the lawsuits roll in. Pass a law saying that if the EHC is in store it must be dispensed and see how many stores now have 'ran out' or no longer stock to avoid potential problems. The ran out excuse with no advice of where else to get is the easy way for anti contraceptive locums to deal with the situation, then what do you have women wanting EHC and no idea where to get it.


Their religious/ethical/moral belief is that they will be abetting murder that is what is wrong with a law forcing them to prescribe EHC and if people want non thinking, box ticking automatons to dispense medicine then maybe they would prefer machines to dispense.

true,Drugba,MN,mongolia,"I really don't know. I'm glad I'm not the one making the decision. Half of me wants to see AVB kick the old boys out of the team and rebuild from the ground up. The other half feels that would be horrible for the clubs image and that if AVB is going to be the next Mourihno, he should be able to build a system out of the players he has not the players he wants.

I defiantly think we need a new play style. Barcelona has taken the next step in the evolution of football and Real Madrid and the Manchester clubs are following suit. Our old, slow, heavily defense based tactics that rely on our physical presence just aren't going to cut it anymore if we want to compete in the Champions League. Speedy one touch passes to unlock the defense seem to be the way the game is going. 

If we plan to play that type of football (Which AVB is) then Terry, Mikel, Drogba and Anelka need to go asap. They just don't fit. Lampard seems to be adapting and where he plays in the midfield means his pace isn't as much of an issue, so I think he could stay.

The only downside to that is if we force players who have pledged them selves to us out of the club we look bad and piss off fans. We look like glory hunters, and it could cause problems with bringing talented youth into the club if they fear they will be let go at the first sign of trouble. With Financial Fair Play starting next season, having a working youth academy will become a huge necessity.

Really, I think we will what the big picture will be for the club in January. Personally, I hope AVB can get Roman to open his wallet and buy a bunch of youth who fit his play style. I would love to see at the end of the year Mikel go to a mid table Prem team (he's not a bad player, he just is too slow for our system, I think he would do well at QPR), Anelka go to MLS, Drogba back to France or into humanitarian work(I truly love the guy but he just isn't fit for the team), Kalou go to anywhere, and Terry (and Lampard if he's not playing anymore) offered positions in the club with the coaching staff. That would give AVB the open spots to build the team he wants without the loyalty issues. I want to see AVB stay but I think this year might be shot for us. I have high hops for the future though.

The Grimm brothers did *not* write the folk lore found in their books. They compiled it. Folk lore changes. It adapts. It modifies to the present time surrounding it to fit in suitably.

You know what happened in the *original* Sleeping Beauty? It was called *The Sun, The Moon, and Talia*, and Talia was Sleeping Beauty and she was raped while she slept by a king who was married to a troll. And she woke up with the twins she gave birth to as she slept sucked out the flax from her finger that put her to sleep. 

It was retold later into other versions--Briar Rose, adapted by the Brothers Grimm and Sleeping Beauty in the Wood, which was a new version written by Perrault. Both were changed--specifically, they were *far*, *far* less morbid. So why not complain that the Grimm brothers...Grimmified a much more scary, ""mature"" fairy tale?

Totally. I whole heartedly accept that they (at least some of them) believe they can make a change. I just don't think they will. 

Personally, what I think they really need for any chance of success is a leader... a face to represent those who feel like they don't have a voice, because when 10000 people all start shouting, nobody gets heard. And since they aren't using guns to change the country, their voice is the most powerful weapon.

Woah there, really?! Haaaa Ok, I won't *tell* you what to do, rather I shall merely *advise* you to remove your head from your arse.

So... You read ""Don't immediately dismiss me here"" as telling you what to do. Of course, of course: I wasn't merely saying ""Now before you dismiss me, please can you have a proper think about it."" No that would be far too obvious and similar to the rest of the language in my comment. Nope, I am actually the thought police telling you what you can and can't do. I can't believe that no-one else on this entire thread has realised that I am incredibly narrow minded and very pushy when it comes to *my* beliefs and making sure everyone follows what *I* want. I'm forever pushing my lack of belief on everyone, trying to make sure people are treated equally regardless of sex, race, age, sexuality or religion. It's a good job people like me aren't the majority - can you imagine what state the country would be in.

&gt; bloody evangelists

You use that word... I do not think it means what you think it means.

I suggest you please ask yourself why you decided I was taking that tone, or why you needed me to take that tone. so you could dismiss that analogy. Could it be that it made some sort of sense? Maybe? We'll never know because someone has thrown his/her toys right out of the pram.

As for the first part of your comment: I think you'll find there are far more secular acting religious people in the country than there are religious people who would want to force their views on others. We'll see what happens in the next decade or so. This situation is no different to people being ""forced"" to treat gays, women or blacks equally. It's all about the compromise of someone's morals, but in reality what someone else does has nothing to do with that person who thinks it is their business.

I have to wonder what your line of argument would have been 30 or 40 years ago. And now of course you're free to imply that I was saying you're homophobic, sexist and racist.

The Brothers Grimm pretty much went around asking people about the tales they had heard. The tales had changed over the years but it seemed like for the most part they tried to stay faithufl to the original tale.

Tales are spun for many reasons, some may be a warning while others are sheer escapism but folklore tales that don't go away generally have a redeeming quality. They did a great job of taking those folklore tales and sharing them with the world.

Tales obviously change as time goes on. Giambattista Basile was an italian story, the Grimm brothers were in what is now known as Germany. Their account of this story would have changed hands many many times and probably been changed each time.

When Walt Disney was alive he was well aware of who the Grimm brothers were and he had access to all their workings, he knew what the source was and exactly what the story was and he didn't ""borrow"" one story he borrowed dozens of them. 

It's also worth noting that the Grimm brothers fairytales are available for free, they weren't copyrighted and were meant to share the tales passed on by people with the world. On the other hand Disney copyrighted what he copied and you would get sued for doing what Walt Disney did with the Grimm brothers.

&gt;Tales obviously change as time goes on. Giambattista Basile was an italian story, the Grimm brothers were in what is now known as Germany. Their account of this story would have changed hands many many times and probably been changed each time.

Giambattista Basile was a *man* and the *story* was named ""Sole, Luna, e Talia"". 

And your point about it changing just furthers my own--that something like the ""original"" version is just false. Much of the time there isn't.

Yeah, *like the Brothers Grimm*, who didn't write a single one of their own stories. Why have a problem with Disney and not with the Grimms? 

&gt;It's also worth noting that the Grimm brothers fairytales are available for free, they weren't copyrighted and were meant to share the tales passed on by people with the world. 

Nothing before 1920-something is copyrighted. I have no idea of the Grimms actually copyrighted what the wrote--but, if they didn't, well, they only wrote down traditional tales as they already exist. They didn't not create.

You acknowledge that Sleeping Beauty the Disney film is different than the folk lore, right? That it's unique? That's why it's copyrighted. Do you think that Doctor Who deserves to make money off of the episodes based from other stories? If you do, then don't be a hypocrite about. Personally, I think Disney's copyright should be worn out for the older movies by now, but I don't agree that they shouldn't have *ever* made money.

true,KR4T0S,null,null,"I think there usually is an original tale, nearly everything we write is formed from some part of our psyche or our experiences.

If you look at the source for a lot of Viking literature for example; the whole horned helmets and their lack of cleansliness. Both are untrue. The Vikings didn't wear horned helmets and the Anglo-Danes were cleaner than most Europeans. The rumours were spread by Christians who wanted to make them look bad because they were afraid of Paganism. Now we still have images of them wearing those horned helmets and being covered with grime and dirt.

All tales have an origin and the problem is that since most tales were passed around by mouth the details were constantly changed. If the stories had all been written down it would be much easier to retell the original tale but that wasn't the case.

The Grimm brothers seemed to take a lot of effort into trying to find the origins of the tale, they often cross referenced and tried to find similarities but of course their chances of documenting the tale the way it was originally told was slim unless they could find the original tales written somewhere(and I believe for a few fairy tales they actually did find originals too).

Books changed our world a lot because instead of relying on passing travellers to relinquish tales and running back to tell our friends what we can remember from them, we could share that exact story with them, the same words.

But like I said all the Grimms stories are freely available. You can download them or take them out from a library. You can't accuse them of heavily copying others works and then ruthlessly guarding what they copied with copyright laws. Disney is one of the studios at the forefront of SOPA and I find that to be quite hilarious.

Doctor Who at least attempts some originality. That is a large part of why the show has endured so long, for the most part it really seems like an entity of its own. Of course sci-fi is nothing new anymore but in the 60's you'd be surprised how much Doctor Who stood out. I think Doctor Who can't be classified as ""borrowing"" from another source in quite the same way that Walt Disney did.

Disney was very clever in the way he changed the story and then copyrighted aspects of his own story to stop people doing the same to him. I love how you can write anything you want about Cinderella from the original tale down to remaking every aspect of it, naming the characters the same and telling the same story but if you drew something even remotely close to Cinderella from the Disney version you would go to court.

I also reject the idea that people weren't intelligent enough to work out sexism was wrong in the 1950's. Damn people knew and rejected sexism and racism way before the 50's, people generally do what they can get away with. Homophobes are a good example of this, people can give no logical explanation for hating homosexuals so they know they are in the wrong for having those opinions.

I think humans shouldn't be under estimated. Some of the greatest writers, musicians, architects and astronomers died many centuries ago.

&gt; You're telling me that the Jadoon/Sontarans knew the TARDIS exploding resulted in the Universe being destroyed but the mastermind behind the plan didn't? Please.

They knew because they investigated the cracks in the universe; which contained pieces of the TARDIS. 

&gt; Also, if, as you postulate, the assassin simply triggered the TARDIS self destruct hoping to kill the Doctor - why would they do it when the Doctor wasn't in the TARDIS?

""Only the Doctor can pilot the TARDIS"" the Silence saw the TARDIS was in flight and blew it up. River Song hand't been born yet, or they simply didn't know she could fly the TARDIS.

Sorry, were you under the impression that you're not allowed to be insulted ever? I think I missed the memo. Not that it matters, because I wasn't even trying to insult you. I was just typing in a way that I sometimes speak and I think I explained it in the last comment: I'm afraid you didn't read it the way it was written. It can be a problem with the written word, particularly on the web, but especially when someone doesn't want to hear what you're saying. As it happens I get the impression you wanted to take issue with me. Call it intuition. So you took offence and now we're left with tittle tattle concerning how something was said rather than what was being spoken about. Hurrah for issue avoidance.

&gt; Shit you no longer have to tell me what to think, you know what I think

Grow up, for Christ's sake (says he, something like a decade your junior). Look at what was actually written:

&gt; I do not **think** it means what you think it means.

""**I** do not *think* it means..."" - it is my opinion and a musing. Consider (oh noes I'm telling you what to do!) the everyday use of ""I think..."". It's a pondering, a theorising. Should I be explaining this? No, you know you were being a prat I think (shit look I did it again). Does it matter? Nope. We're just getting further away from the issue. That suits you, rather than me, by the way. You started down the road of avoidance by getting arsey. That's not a mentally healthy way to deal with things, btw.

&gt; Don't mistake being in the majority (in the thread) with being right.

*slow hand clap* Yes of course, I was forgetting that(!) I only got interested in secularism because it's what the cool kids were doing. Silly me, siding with the majority of secular thinking atheists that dominate the landscape of the UK. 

Do me a favour. There's a reason the NSS exists or are you of the opinion that it sprang out of nowhere with no justification behind people getting concerned about secular issues?

&gt; My views have been remarkably consistent for over 20 years of adulthood thank you very much

One of the few people who has been right about everything all the time since they turned 18? Nice one. In the same way you tell me to avoid being in the majority, I could warn you against never reconsidering your world view.

And of course you can see just how unjustified that sort of assumption about *you* would be, I hope. Perhaps you could extend the courtesy to others. Remember: I'm not the one who is (I think) happy with particular moral issues (homophobia) being legislated against but not others (anti-abortion/contraception). If I'm making assumptions, do let me know: You haven't so far even though I've made analogies. When I did you decided I was telling you what to think, which is pretty pathetic.

&gt;  I'm not going to rise to your troll.

It wasn't a troll, rather I was making sure you didn't take a particular line in an attempt to deflect attention even further away from the topic under discussion.

But you're leaving? I'd thought you done that already when you decided I was telling you what to do or think. That was such a classic get-out-of-discussion that I assumed you'd not return. You don't have to now of course, unless you'd like the last word? Mind you, I imagine you might say ""No, I'll leave that to you because you so obviously want it."" or similar.

true,Axius,uk,United Kingdom,"I don't understand particularly why the EU was involved over this unless it's because the bank perhaps held some assets in EU countries and was required to oblige to a ruling.

As far as I'm concerned, the same deal Labour signed would have been done under the Tories unless they would have let the bank go under, and as far as I can tell, nobody sensible would let a bank go under due to the impact this has on people whose savings are in the bank. They could perhaps be guaranteed, but given we know now the scale of the financial sector's crisis, bailing out the banks was in my opinion, whilst expensive, a good idea.

Osborne in this case needs to stand up for his decision. He had until 2013 and has given no evidence to suggest he tried to extend the deal since Northern Rock was amongst the first banks to fail before the recession kicked off.

Most places in Brighton charge a cover fee on New Years Eve, which is bullshit but the world we live in. The best NYE nights I've had in Brighton started at a friend's house party and then moved down to the Old Steine (the area near the Pavilion), where there are usually hundreds of people partying. Some years we took some food and drinks with us, then all headed down to the beach after midnight. Last time we were down there until sunrise, though I don't remember too much of the night.

However, if you'd prefer to go to a bar or a club, expect it to be very loud and crowded, and you'll have to pay about £10-20 each to get in. Most places will have a couple of drinks deals on, and to be honest on New Years one place is pretty much as good as another in my experience. There are some lovely pubs in Brighton but at NY it's pretty much mayhem.

The beach is a nice place to watch the fireworks from after midnight hits. Down to the left side of the Pier is generally a good spot.

&gt; Finally, “Up All Night” is stuck on a separate disc from the other mini-episodes, which is initially rather mystifying. All becomes clear when you watch it, as it has absolutely no connection to them. Only a minute long, it was clearly written with the intention of using it as one of the “episode prequels” used to promote the series online. Featuring Craig, Sophie and, er, Stormageddon, it’s set shortly before the events of “Closing Time” and basically establishes the set-up for the episode. Viewed after you’ve seen Gareth Roberts’s episode it is, to be honest, pretty pointless.

I like Schuerrle a lot, he adds a lot of width to Leverkusen, is pretty tricky/creative, and from what I've seen in his time with the NT, not bad at finishing either. He should be able to play both wings, so he'd add a lot of versatility. If possible, he should be a good addition.

Marin was highly touted, but the general consensus is that his ability now does not match the predicted potential. Not sure if he'll be able to pick his form up or if he's destined for mediocrity. He can play on the wings and in the middle, was supposed to reach the same levels as Mesut Oezil, but has yet to come anywhere close. Completely overshadowed now by the newer German players like Muelller, Oezil, Schuerrle, Goetze, even Sidney Sam. Not worth the risk.

I have not heard much on either Kruse or Rausch. Kruse plays for FC St Pauli, who are in the second Bundesliga - I don't really follow that and he hasn't made much impact at the NT level. Rausch seems interesting, able to play basically anywhere on the left flank so maybe a cheaper alternative to Pereira.

Reus is generating tons of interest and has started to break into the NT, which is not an easy thing to do.

true,ultrasupergenius,english,A Yank in Jolly Old London,"As a fellow ex-pat, i will jump in with my thoughts on the bacon front.

First - there is absolutely nothing that can touch a nice thick maple and pepper cured apple wood smoked and slab of American bacon.  Nothing.  It is unreal.  That being said - it is something you really have to go out of your way to find.  Perhaps 5% or less of american bacon falls into this sublime category.  It is thick and meaty, full of amazing smoky rich and complex flavor, and relatively lean (as bacon goes).

The majority of the American bacon is somewhat fatty, salt brine cured, thinly sliced, and flavored with artificial smoke flavoring.  It has its place on a breakfast plate - and is tasty - but comes up short compared to the earlier mentioned gold standard.  75% of bacon in the states falls into the general category of 'tasty'.  

Cheap american bacon is just plain gross.  You can find it at breakfast buffets and cheap hotels.  It is to be avoided, and unfortunately accounts for about 20% of the bacon available... but because it traditionally gets served in hotels - gets disproportionately served to tourists and visitors.  It is fatty and flavorless, and generally coated with grease.  Avoid.

It is hard to find a bad bit of British bacon.  On the whole, British bacon is good.  It is a much leaner cut, and more substantial as a result.  It has some decent flavor.  You can get the cheapest of fry ups, and rest assured that the bacon will be quite palatable.  When it is good - it is quite good.  It lends itself to being (IMHO) the star of the most British of sandwiches - the bacon sandwich.  

I have yet to find British bacon that is the equivalent of the best of the best American bacon.  That is not to say that I do not believe it exists.  I want, and need, to believe it exists.  Probably in some back alley London bacon sandwich pub that can only be accessed by tapping on the correct bricks or running into a wall at St. Pancras.

If anyone can point me in the direction of the best of the best of British bacon, I will indeed be in your debt.  ",0,1321944251,null,0,false,0,c31t09z,t3_mkmoo,t1_c31t09z,t1_c31pkbr,1427913139,20,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,20

true,robbyrue,null,null,"I'm gonna be extremely frank here and say that I thought this episode was horribly managed. A rule of thumb for scriptwriters: Don't tackle a conundrum or a concept that you can't properly explain. When you decide to write a convoluted topic such as time travel into your script, you better get it right. Even then, that's difficult as hell. Learn from series 1 and 2. If time travel ever becomes a pervasive concept behind your plot, the least you could do is keep things simple. Let one character (*just one*) deal with all the changes. It worked wonderfully with Simon and Curtis's stories. Once you invite the world (and show it on film) into that change, you're making things so much more difficult than they have to be. It's an open invitation to logical fallacies and plot holes. The characters maintained their charm (I really liked Rudy in this episode; his lines were a lot less contrived), and the new probation worker was a lot more likable for some reason - but if you look at the third series as a whole, you'll find that it's *so* disjointed compared to the first two series. If you have all the episodes from the first two series I suggest watching all the 'Next Week on Misfits' clips. There's a common thread throughout every single one and you really get the feeling that the writers placed a great emphasis on continuity and storytelling. I really hope they can salvage this series with the next few episodes.

true,Drugba,MN,mongolia,"No problem I like talking about Chelsea and I like hearing myself talk so this is a pleasure : ).

&gt;Do you think Terry would ever except a Giggs type role on Chelsea?

Not in this system, he's just too slow for the system AVB wants to play and he doesn't play any position other than CB. If we went back to playing a more defensive game plan I think he still would have a few more years in him.

&gt; Do you think coming into this season AVB knew it might be a struggle, maybe not this big of one, but he had to know the personnel we have and what type of team he wants to run.

I don't know what AVB thought, but personally I believed that this would be a season of change, and I saw a lot of pundits backing up this opinion. No way did I expect the crap we are playing now, but pre-season very few people had Chelsea to win the title (I think most common prediction was 3rd behind the Manchesters). AVB has only been a coach 3 years and has never coached at a level equal to the premier league. He did kick ass with Porto last year but his main competition Benfica and Sporting CP didn't have the best years. Not to say he had an easy run, but it could have been harder for him. He's young and I think he just needs time to learn what tatics work in the Prem. Pre season I was really hoping to see Hidink come as Head coach and have AVB be mentored by him, but realistically that wasn't going to happen.

&gt;With my limited knowledge I would assume that Drogs and Anelka for sure will not be a part of the squad next season.

I'm pretty sure Anelka has said he wants to play out this season then leave. With Drogba I think he could stay for one more year and take Anelka's spot on the bench. I hope this is the case because I would really like to see him mentor Lukaku and mold him the great player he could be. The only problem is if Drogba's ego can take the hit of playing less than 100 minutes a month.

&gt;I understand that cutting players who have been a part of the club for a long time could be a P.R. nightmare, but this is a business and if we don't make moves we could slip into the middle of the table and then maybe up and coming players might not want to come here.

I think that is one of the amazing things about soccer, especially in Europe is that there is so much emphasis on history. Most clubs have been around 100+ years, because of that every club has had its ups and downs. In the long run trophies matter and money can buy trophies, but money runs out if you're a club buying trophies eventually you'll end up back down in league one or two and that is when history matters. When the bad times hit, people want their club to be remembered as respectful and proud, not a club buying mercenaries to pick up silverware. 

Also, as for soccer being a business, all of the major clubs (except maybe Arsenal) are operating at huge losses. The major clubs right now aren't there to make money, they are there to win trophies(That kind of flies in the fact of my last point).

And Lastly...

&gt;One last one is this Financial Fair Play thing like a salary cap?

Financial fair play is an attempt to stop teams from buying up the transfer market and stop team stacking. At it's most basic is says a team can only spend the money they make.

true,bowling4meth,english,Straight out of Surrey,"&gt; Rubbish collection is not state monopolised

*Checks council tax bill* - I respectfully disagree. Where's my opt-out?

&gt; it's a natural monopoly.

No, it's not. It's only a monopoly because you have to pay for it whether you want it or not. There's plenty of things that councils won't take that you have to arrange of disposal for but because people have to pay for collection by the council the market for the other companies to expand into general waste collection is artificially stunted. If the councils were to regulate companies already taking waste that the councils won't take and licence them to offer such services combined with an opt-out (if people take those services) then you'll get a better range of options for your waste disposal. Some might want to pay a flat fee, some might want to pay by weight, some might want discounts based on recycling etc. Sadly nobody gets that option - you get what the council tells you you're going to get, which in my neighbourhood means that you have to put a lock on the different bins provided by the council so that the local wildlife don't get into the bins and drag everything out.

&gt; You can't have 5 or 6 different rubbish collection lorries going up and down the same streets every day, it would be disruptive and grossly inefficient.

Aside from the fact that you're talking about 6 vehicles going up the same road over a 24 hour period, which strikes me as fine in areas that can support it (and obviously less so on busy roads, so I get your point but think it's a little overblown, but that's just being pedantic), there's more than one way to skin a cat. You could for example following the BT model have a company licensed to take the waste from the doorstep and others to sell the service or handle the waste at the point of disposal. All of these could be licensed and it would depend entirely on how the privatisation would work.

&gt; As to your BT point, phone lines and call charges are far more expensive now than they used to be

I'm afraid I'm going to need to see some evidence before I can accept that. After privatisation I remember a debate in the early 90s about the UK having the highest call costs in Europe, but IIRC (and I could be wrong) the call costs were similar to what they'd been before and this was before Ofcom's Retail Price Controls came in. The RPC I believe has gone, but there is sufficient competition these days to allow lower prices.

These days my landline costs about £10 month, or according to the bank of England the equivalent of £3.98 in 1984 (at the point of privatisation). I can't remember what my home phone bills were like then but I do remember paying 10p a minute to call Manchester, something that I get included for free with my bill now.

&gt; There is no real competition either, the monopoly has just been passed to BT wholesale, who have to be micromanaged by the regulator to stop them abusing their position.

I'd disagree here. At the point of privatisation you had BT providing calls and X.25 links. They then invested a ton in ISDN. I remember getting ISDN in the 90s, future of the Internet they said. It cost a fortune. I also remember BT being chastised for deliberately delaying broadband roll-out and the hoo-hah over loop unbundling while they attempted to recoup the massive cost of their ISDN roll-out (it never really took off in the home as it was so expensive, so they held back on rolling out ADSL and made it more expensive to buy even though it was cheaper - I remember Ofcom having a field day with them over this), so you're right they do need regulation but all monopolies need regulation, and to be honest when we go back to refuse collection it's clear we would need regulation to keep businesses honest and standards at a reasonable level. The worst form of privatisation is where you replace a public monopoly with a private one, such as the privatisation of part of Bolivia's [water supply](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2000_Cochabamba_protests) and just leave it. That's why you'd need a regulator. I'd find the argument that Ofcom is micromanaging BT wholesale somewhat disingenuous (mainly due to my experiences of Ofcom and with BT wholesale), but you would have to regulate waste control, which to be honest should be done regardless of who does it.",0,1321951616,null,0,false,0,c31to55,t3_mk0qa,t1_c31to55,t1_c31socu,1427913457,-1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,-1

Dozens of different sausages, salamis, and cold meats at the deli counter. Plenty of different fruits and vegetables all year round. Aisles of tasty and not entirely unhealthy snacks.

I go through a supermarket in New Zealand and feel a little deflated. The sausages are ""pork flavoured. ingredients: 'meat' (beef, chicken, lamb)"" unless you go for the expensive ones, which still taste awful. The cheese is all made from the same rubber constitute, each with a slightly different flavouring. The fruit and vegetables aren't too bad, but it's made me realise how much the big supermarkets in Britain weed out any imperfections. Most of the produce in New Zealand is the stuff the foreign exports won't take. Bruised, marked, oddly shaped. Speaking of exports, lamb is surprisingly very expensive here because producers charge export prices. It's also fairly low quality, again because the good stuff goes abroad.

true,mad_disciple,null,null,"The analysis of first half to second doesn't analyse the situation. Although the stats will say that they were further forward in the second half this is also after an adjustment and that they were facing a deficit in the game. The difference between 41221 and 4231 is pretty negligible really. They still played with one holding midfielder in the second half and Lampard and Mata were just pushed up higher (with Mata having more of a free role). On top of that it is clear that Liverpool changed their tactics as they were running a lot in the first half and were clearly tiring and sitting more defensively from the mid-point on. Only the defensive ineptitude from Chelsea let them win this game.

The other aspect of this analysis that isn't correct is understanding the ability of the players in the team. They didn't go after Modric for no reason, there's clearly a lack of creative talent in the middle. Lampard has never been a creative midfielder but a good workman like one, Ramires is also a hard working central midfielder but not a creative force. Having Mata in the hole works well but then there's a lack of quality on the wings (Malouda is more miss than hit and Kalou is just rubbish). Sturridge has been good but seems more suited to a central striking role due to his selfishness and desire to attack the net whenever possible, there isn't anyone else behind that. Once the players are in place I have no doubts the attacking force will be much improved but defensively there are still major flaws.

The issues for Chelsea aren't formation but pressing, defensive positioning and how bloody high their defensive line is. It seems unnecessarily high at all times and leaves centre backs exposed almost 1-on-1 at numerous times. It's easy to turn them with a ball over the top for attackers to run on to and leaves them hopelessly out of position and easy to exploit.

To be fair not all of the drivers are like this, there's a couple of really nice ones, but so far I've had;

A bus drive away in front of me as I was running towards it, he waited until I got about 4ft from the door before closing it, laughing, and waving at me as he drove off. It was dark and raining.

Drivers refusing to accept £10 notes from students, but accepting them from locals.

A driver yell ""look fer yerself!"" at me, for asking whether the bus he was driving went to campus.

Drivers smoking on the buses.

Drivers stopping when they see other bus drivers in order to have a chat and holding up traffic. Ignoring the beeps and shouts from the cars behind them.

And included in this is a general and very obvious dislike of anyone under the age of 25, Cornish or not, because they *might* be a student.

I even had a taxi driver drive into me when I was skateboarding down the street; he claims I shouldn't have been in the road; true it's not technically legal to skateboard in the road, but neither is driving into someone, knocking them off they're skateboard and then yell ""gerrof the faacking road"" as you do so.

Bradford is a shithole. Bradford has the second highest crime rate in Britain, and is substantially derelict. It is frankly depressing. Little Germany (as someone else mentioned) is an attractive victorian industrial quarter. Problem is that it's attached to the rest of the city.

I don't say this lightly, Bradford is my home town and I'd prefer to be able to be positive about it. But the truth is difficult to deny in this case.

Some parts of Leeds can be pretty dire as well, so you do need to be careful. Crime seems to be all or nothing up here.

What West Yorkshire does have to offer, is attractive out of town or suburban villages that should not be too expensive. £600 - 700 should get you something very reasonable. A quaint 2 bedroom cottage wouldn't be out of reach in many areas.

You will need somewhere near the M62 for work. You'll certainly need somewhere between Leeds and Bradford for ease of commute. Pontefract is going to be the place that you'll trek to, I think. The others are all pretty accessible.

Have a look at places in or around:

Birkenshaw

Ossett

Clayton or Baildon (these might be on the wrong side of Bradford for your commute. I've lived in Baildon and it is pleasant)

Cleckheaton

Rodley

Drighlington

American checking in. I agree with all of the above, but for the sake of argument, I'll list some of the things I don't like. A lot of it relates to pub food and eating out of the house, and being a poor uni student:

* Seasonings. There's more to seasonings than salt. I went to a pub yesterday that put black pepper on chips and nearly passed out for the joy of flavor. Other times, there are other spices which have no business being where they are. Coriander finds its way in to far too many dishes here, and fennel is one of the worst tasting seasonings I've ever had second only to tarragon.

* Weird sandwiches. Most times, sandwiches are simply rather plain, like egg-cress or ham and butter. Others are weird like the prawn sandwiches or bacon and cranberry. It's hard to get a ham sandwich with lettuce, tomato, pickle (almost always only cucumber), onion and mustard. Subways exist here, and so I can get a sandwich fix, but I miss the sandwich shops of Dallas like Great Outdoors.

* If you like green things besides peas, don't bother with pubs. I've had some pubs actually give me a salad as a side dish, but most times it's peas. Peas peas peas, unseasoned, unflavored peas. One pub put mashed lettuce on my mashed potatoes.

* Lamb and mint pasties. 

* Soulless hamburger buns

That said, some of the best food can be found eating out, if longevity isn't your concern. Full fry ups are amazing, and so are most pasties. Beer is universally accessible, and I'm getting used to and enjoying bitter ale. Did I mention pasties? And pies has been mentioned. Fanta is the best soft drink over here, especially after a good hike. Sausage and mashed potatoes are the best food ever, and I immediately dislike a pub that doesn't serve it. Sainsbury's has the best pasta sauce I've ever eaten.",0,1321960481,null,0,true,0,c31u6jy,t3_mkmoo,t1_c31u6jy,t1_c31q77y,1427913680,5,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,5

&gt;3.9 Borrowing – The current devolution settlement provides no authority for the Scottish Parliament to sanction meaningful borrowing by the Scottish Government. There is the opportunity for short-term borrowing sufficient to cover “a temporary excess of sums
paid out of the Scottish Consolidated Fund over sums paid into the Fund” or for “providing a working balance in the Fund”. Any such borrowings may only be from HM Treasury.

&gt;3.10 Local authorities in Scotland do have the autonomy to borrow. The Scottish Government funds the debt servicing costs of some of this borrowing, known as ""supported borrowing"", via the Revenue Support Grant whilst the unsupported borrowing element, arranged under the Prudential Regime, is financed through local authorities‟ own general resources. The Northern Ireland Executive also has limited borrowing powers.

&gt;3.11 Further afield, most other devolved governments with comparable levels of policy autonomy have the authority to borrow in order to facilitate fiscal planning and management of cash flows as well as financing long-term investments and economic
strategies. For example, U.S. States and Canadian Provinces have powers to
borrow, where bond issuances – particularly to finance infrastructure and capital
spending like bridges and schools – are common.

true,AmericanChelseaFans,present,null,"While I agree that the 41221 and 4231 are fairly close in formation, I don't think the difference is negligible.  Having a dedicated player higher up in the middle of the field brings a new element to the attack that is missing in the 4-3-3 (or 41221).  Time and time again this season we have seen Sturridge, Anelka, even Mata stranded out on the right wing with no connection to the rest of the team.  Having Mata in the hole allows Chelsea to be able to involve the right side of the field more which is essential so that Chelsea doesn't become predictable like they have been in years past.

I completely agree that having Mata in the hole will expose our wing weakness.  Malouda is past his prime and was never a fit for AVB's system from the beginning.  Getting a cheap(ish) player like De Bruyne in the January window would be very good for Chelsea.  De Bruyne-Mata-Sturridge would be a good attacking 3 IMO.  

As for the issues, I agree that defensive positioning and pressing is the main issue, but disagree about the high line.  The reason the high line has not worked is because of the first 2 issues, not the high line itself.  The problem lies in the fact that Chelsea has been pressuring very poorly and thus been extremely out of position.  Pressing is dangerous for that reason, if you fail then you and your team are not in good defensive shape.  When one or two players fail and are out of position our high line is extremely exposed and gets torn to shreds.  The 4231 is well suited for a pressing game and could help solve some of the issues.  

While the 4231 isn't a cure all, I think with a key signing in January (followed by a Hazard-like one this summer) it can salvage the season. ",0,1321967613,null,0,false,0,c31ulu9,t3_ml3vg,t1_c31ulu9,t1_c31u21k,1427913879,2,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,2

&gt;This would just mean that if you look young you will be continually pulled over. I don't see how this will lead to lower insurance cost. 

If there are some young drivers drink driving, the chance they're caught increases; this costs the insurer nothing to enforce because it's a police matter, but once a driver is caught, the insurer can charge them significantly more or avoid them altogether. This reduces the insurers risk exposure, saving them money.


&gt;If it were the case then insurers could just do this themselves (and some do). If you drive between certain hours you are driving uninsured. 

The enforcement is again done by police at no cost to the insurer, resulting in similar gains as above.

&gt;Your last point seems to be really backwards, it's like saying to someone who wants to buy a cake that they should buy half a cake because it will cost less. You still have to pay the same amount (Or likely more) per unit time you can drive.

I'm saying the insurer could charge for the whole cake, even though they only need to provide half of it. They sell policies on date ranges, all for 24 hour cover, so they could argue the price should stay the same. This is particularly easy to justify for fully comprehensive or fire and theft cover.

true,PhoBWanKenobi,mcgann,McGann,"I have. I did it last season, when it was quite a bit easier, and have been putting together this season's chronology, too. I've written a bunch of blog posts about it, since it's been pretty complicated. There's no question in my mind that the confidential timeline is wrong. It doesn't match narratively or in terms of stuff like costuming. Blog posts are here, if you want to know what my justification for the timeline is: ( http://www.phoebenorth.com/2011/10/05/steven-moffat-youre-the-timey-wimiest/
http://www.phoebenorth.com/2011/10/06/river-song-rewatch-report-2-is-the-official-timeline-accurate/
http://www.phoebenorth.com/2011/11/21/philcon-cosplay-and-the-timeline-of-river-song/ )

the tl;dr version is that this is the best approximation of the current timeline I've been able to come up with: 

The following events are still definitively undated:

* The Doctor and River share an adventure in “the Bone Meadows.”
* The Doctor and River visit Easter Island together.
* The Doctor and River meet a being named “Jim the Fish” – Note that it has been suggested that this adventure happens in the 200 years between the Doctor’s appearances in “The Impossible Astronaut,” but due to a bootstrap paradox, it’s possible that this actually occurs at some other point during the Doctor’s timeline.
* The Doctor and River have a picnic at Asgard – I’ve seen suggestions that the picnic at Lake Silencio, where the Doctor is given a “Viking” funeral, is actually this picnic. It’s possible, and would be very Moffaty.
* The Doctor and River spend her birthday ice skating on the Thames to Stevie Wonder.

Otherwise, we’re left with the following timeline of episodes:

* A Good Man Goes to War (born)
* The Impossible Astronaut (childhood – raised by the Silence, shot at by her mother)
* Day of the Moon (childhood, first regeneration)
* Let’s Kill Hitler (adolescence/meets the Doctor/enrolls in Luna University)
* Closing Time (Becomes Doctor Song, is taken again by Kovarian)
* The Wedding of River Song (Marries the Doctor/kills the Teselecta)
* First Night (on her first night in jail, the Doctor takes River on a romantic excursion)
* First Night (five years later, while battling Sontarans, she stumbles into the TARDIS. The Doctor gives her a vortex manipulator, and then sends her off)
* A Good Man Goes to War (reveals her identity to the Doctor and the Ponds)
* The Impossible Astronaut/Day of the Moon (Witnesses the Doctor’s death, wears shiny green dress, last kiss with the Doctor)
* The Pandorica Opens (Leaves a message for the Doctor at the beginning of time with another vortex manipulator which she’s procured from Dorium Maldovar – then she steals a painting from Liz X and meets the Doctor in ancient Rome)
* The Big Bang (Leaves her journal to trigger her mother’s memory. Is given back her vortex manipulator.)
* Time of Angels/Flesh and Stone (The crash of the Byzantium)
* The Wedding of River Song (Tells her parents the Doctor is alive)
* First Night (The Doctor promises to take her to the singing towers)
* Silence in the Library/Forest of the Dead (death)

I've driven a variety of old bangers (none of them less than 10 years old, most of them under £600, one at £2,500) in the last 13 years, and recently moved to a new Škoda Superb. The difference between the £600 bangers and the £2,500 banger in terms of responsiveness was incredible - it moved from ""do something stupid, guaranteed to end up in a ditch or a crash"" to ""do something stupid, possibly just frighten yourself with the way the controls feel unresponsive"".

Moving to the new car has been a major change - suddenly, things which I know from my banger driving days were minor mistakes go from ""make the controls feel funny"" to ""no reaction from the car at all - it just copes"". Things that I know would have had me fighting to maintain control of the banger just cause it to flash a traction warning light at me. I've not pushed it far enough to know what would happen if I pushed it to places where a banger would lose control - but I suspect it would hold on that bit longer, then catastrophically lose it.

I can thus easily see that if 17 year old new drivers are typically driving £500 bangers, while 35 year old new drivers are typically driving £10,000+ modern cars, the improvements in car technology mean that a significant proportion of the apparent increased risk of young drivers is in fact simply them not having access to the same safety technology as new drivers.

Unfortunately, I have no idea where I'd find data to let me put this hypothesis to the test - if anyone knows of somewhere that would let me correlate insurance value of car, age of car, age of driver, and number of years experience of driver for accidents in the last few years, I'd be interested in putting this to the test.",0,1321971521,null,0,false,0,c31uy6n,t3_mlbkg,t1_c31uy6n,t1_c31ubqx,1427914044,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

As such restricting the hours, passenger numbers, alcohol influence etc. is a way the insurance companies think will reduce accidents, deaths or injuries and, more importantly to them, claims.

I can see the sense behind them calling for a ban or curfew, but I'm not sure I agree with it. Of course when I was that age I was mightily pissed off at being tarred with the same brush, as I never had an accident, claim or anything similar. I know that I am a safer driver than a large number of older people out there and I was even at that age. Then as has been discussed in this thread there's the problem of boundary, but this is a factor in all age restrictions: Why is a 17 year 11 month year old much less responsible than an 18 year 1 month year old?

Let's not forget that by 17 someone can be married and have a child.

**Clothing Slogans**

Most parents seem to think that clothing slogans are completely harmless. May be the case with many slogans, but honestly, when your 7 year old daughter is wearing a T shirt that says something like 'The world revolves around ME', don't be surprised when she turns out to be an entitled bitch when she grows up. Likewise, in what universe is it acceptable to have sexually suggestive slogans on children's clothes? I saw a dummy in a shop for babies aged 6 months that said 'Flirt' on them. It's a fucking baby! Why the fuck are you even suggesting that your baby flirts with people or wants to be flirted with?? Or knickers for 10 year olds that say somthing like 'tease' on them.

**General clothing**

Little girls do *not* need their midriffs out, nor do they need to be wearing high-heels. It's not like any of this clothing offends me or makes me feel particularly uncomfortable - I'm confident enough that I'm not a pedophile, thank-you - but I just worry for the impact it will have on the girls. Why are we surprised by 'slutty' behaviour and the apparent obsession with body image that teenaged girls have when right from an early age parents are encouraging them to show flesh and wear make-up?

And don't even get me started on bikinis for pre-teens. Do I even need to go into how inappropriate that is? Or even... padded bras for kids...

The fact that I can't find reliable figures for exactly how many companies are involved speaks volumes in itself. Each of these companies will have layers of managements. Each of these companies will have contracts with each of the others. Each of them will have lawyers, accountants and share holders that demand payment.

The idea of a minimum 1 year learning period makes no sense because everyone learns at a different rate, if an instructor feels you are ok after 6 lessons then so be it.

Likewise the idea of a curfew is ludicrous and impractical - what if you get delayed at work, have some sort of family emergency which needs you to drive, etc. However driving at night does require a slightly different approach and is that bit more challenging than driving in daytime.

What I'd prefer to see would be a change to the driving tuition/test process; have a log-book style approach whereby you have to do a certain number of daylight road hours, a certain number of hours at night, a certain number of miles at on higher speed (50/60mph roads), etc. Then that logbook has to be presented as part of your test.

The downside is that a time-based graduation doesn't take into account miles done, you could have driven 20k miles within your first 6 months and be a far more experienced driver than the person who does 1000 miles a year, but you are stuck with the same limit. But unless you start fitting people with milometers then there's no way around that.

Yes, there are private businesses that provide services and products to the NHS but you can hardly call it a free market system, pharmacies provide medicines to people for free or £7.50 and are reimbursed for cost by the government. 

The point I was trying to get at here is that if the government attempts to implement a US-style system there would be absolutely no way that government would last. Any attempt at restricting care or not providing it as a right would be deeply popular with people, and there would be millions out everywhere. You completely missed my point and instead tried to make me sound stupid as if I didn't already know that private businesses provide products and services to the NHS, which is the most obvious thing in the world. Privatization in this sense means the implementation of market mechanisms in care.

They don't really add anything to the story. Same goes for the ""Fookin' Nazees"" line in the latest episode. It's one of the least substantive lines in the episode but for some reason, it gets special emphasis because of the way she says it. And some people here will look at that and think, 'It's genius cause it's Kelly!' - when the truth is that the writers have merely resorted to milking the Kelly character who was so prevalent in the first two series.

Both are ""tax free"" in as much as you won't pay income tax on any interest paid or capital gains tax if/when you sell it.

With a Cash ISA, it's pretty much just like a savings account - you save in to it and get interest (tax free).

With Stocks &amp; Shares ISA, you pick one or more funds / shares to invest in and the return is based on the performance of these.

Depending on where you buy the stocks and shares ISA you will have access to different funds or shares. Different banks / fund managers / stock brokers will have different options for you to invest in.

When choosing the funds, you need to consider the level of risk you are taking (you may lose the money you invest), the charges for the funds (initial charges and ongoing fees) and the likely performance of the funds. 

If you've topped up your Cash ISA, you may be able to transfer the money into a stocks and shares ISA, but again, consider the risk of moving your money from the relatively safe cash into potentially more risky investments.

When Older You goes back to his present, he either crosses back to Universe A and sees no change to time or stays in Universe B and is essentially a paradox.  Other theory is that you create the time machine, go back 30 years and when you hand yourself the schematics you effectively erase the original timeline and create a new one where you are given the plans by Older You who now is unstuck in time and either ceases to exist or exists, but with no where to go and now no new dimension is created, but the timeline is changed.

Of course, optional sub-national elections, because turn out is lower, can make it easier for extremists with a dedicated base to get in. 

To be honest, the bigger problem with Australia's mandatory voting is that in the Senate, which ostensibly uses STV, a very open system giving quite a lot of power to voters, has been transformed into essentially a closed-list proportional system, the one that gives least choice and most power to the party machine. This is because the massive ballot papers made filling in every entry was too much of an effort and the parties introduced an option to let the party choose the preferences for you on each ballot paper. 95% of voters do this, so it's essentially a closed-list system.

For those who are saying they will be upset *if* this happens, it should be pointed out that this *is already* happening, and in some cases has happened already.

Any Qualified Provider is already going through for certain areas.  You already pay for elements of Dentistry, optometry, and prescriptions.  The current NHS commissioning bodies are already shedding staff rapidly, and being instructed to set up those staff  that remain as organisations that the CCGs can buy commissioning support from in competition with the private sector.

true,TX1138,pertwee,Pertwee,"I'm completely with LokianEule on this one. There was a *huge* difference between what happened to Rory regarding the Pandorica and Amy's 'life' on Apalapucia, and it shows. 

The fact is that Amy had been let down *again*, and forced to wait *again*, by the very man who promises to save her. It's telling that she names her robot Rory; he's the only one who has remained at her side all the years they've been together. It's important to remember that she was *NOT* angry at Rory; she is angry at the Doctor, and rightly so.

In the end, it is the Doctor who manages to manipulate events to suit himself, effectively killing older Amy whilst allowing younger Amy to live. For all the cries of older Amy being a bitch, it is the Doctor who is being a complete bastard throughout this episode. He lies, cheats and manipulates his way from the safety of his TARDIS, and when it actually came to making the decision to kill off older Amy, he forces the decision onto *Rory*. That was a bit of a dick move, whatever way you want to look at it.

We are shown that older Amy's anger at the Doctor is justified, and that the Doctor is a man who often cannot be trusted on his word. Hell, this whole season (well, *The Big Bang* onwards) was about how DocEleven is willing to lie, cheat and manipulate those around him to suit his needs. *The Girl Who Waited* is a merely a part of this puzzle, and shows just how much of an impact this can have on those around him.",0,1322000504,null,0,false,0,c31zgh0,t3_mluiy,t1_c31zgh0,t1_c31z0k1,1427916233,7,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,7

Imagine the numerous parts of a cell phone that could be applied to other areas of technology. The material that each specific component of the phone is made of could be utilised for technological advancement that isn't limited to communication. To think that the Germans would look at the phone and simply say, 'Whelp. I guess all this is good for is improving our communication procedures.' is being way too kind to the writers of this episode. And the whole 'Kelly kicking the shit out of Hitler' gimmick was another idiotic thing to include. How could Hitler getting his ass kicked in his private office by some random girl in an orange jumpsuit not change history whatsoever? She just comes back from beating the shit out of Hitler and everything's fine. How is that even fucking possible?

You know, one thing I really don't like about television series is how they sometimes venture into shark-infested territory like time travel. If one took the butterfly effect into consideration, this episode would barely survive any serious scrutiny. If Germany won the war, and consequently forced its way into Britain (which it was practically doing for most of the period until [The Battle of Britain](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Britain)), that would unequivocally influence a number of elements with directly affect the main characters. Their parents would have grown up in a dictatorial society, thereby completely altering the manner in which our main characters would have developed from childhood to adulthood. That being the case, we have to ask ourselves why they all end up in the exact same situation - stuck in the same geographical area once more. Is it not possible - given the oppressive nature of government at the time - that one of our main characters' families would have sought to escape the British Isles? Or is there no escape to democracy? Has America been conquered as well? If you just think about the concepts and the changes by which this episode operates, it's blindingly clear that the writers didn't really think this one out. To say that they're stuck in the same situation because they *just are* is terribly lazy.

I don't think that we have to bother rationalising a lot of the things in this episode. It comes off to me as if the writers just said, 'Plot holes? A lack of continuity? Heh.

Whilst he did make that point clear early on, he put up little resistance to Rory and Older Amy's protests, and instead started pandering and toying with their emotions with the full intent of tearing them down once his goal was achieved.

In *TGWW* we see the Doctor flat-out lying to Rory and Amy, and from that we see a darker side of DocEleven emerge. If it was DocNine or DocTen, or indeed any other Doctor aside from Docs Two, Seven and Eleven, I have a feeling that they might try and either avoid the question completely, or just go ahead and tell them that it was impossible. However, this has the Doctor deliberately toying with his companion's emotions in order to suit his own agenda.

He gives them hope and then rips it away from them. *That* is what was so twisted about the Doctor's actions, especially since when the same was done to him in *The Doctor's Wife*, he gets all huffy and angry about it. He *knew* what he was doing was morally questionable, but he went ahead and did it anyway. There was no real reason for him having to go about doing it in this manner, apart from it being the easiest route to take. That is what separates him from DocTen, who really only ever did 'bad' things when he was pushed to his limits.

That final shot of his cold, staring eyes was one of pure, unadulterated menace, and did a lot to cement his Doctor alongside the likes of Docs Two and Seven as being the type of Doctor who may appear happy and friendly on the outside, but who will have no qualms about performing morally questionable acts to achieve a certain goal.",0,1322005496,null,0,true,0,c32082j,t3_mluiy,t1_c32082j,t1_c3202oi,1427916604,0,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,0

&gt;If parents can’t see anything wrong in dressing up their children in ‘Future WAG’ t-shirts and letting them wear make-up, high heels and ‘mini-me’ sexy clothing, then something is intensely wrong in our society. I have no doubt that these are the parents who have been failed by the education system themselves. These are the parents without support, experience or networks. They have grown up without any respect for their elders or any idea of how to bring up a child. How can they bring up their own children correctly if they have been failed themselves? But how do we break the cycle? Education, of course – and the support of schools embedded in their communities.

Historically, it seems the Doctor has had problems with his companions aging, and that does set up a nice way to get around it (and it wouldn't surprise me if River figured out a way to get out and reconstitute herself, as the other people that got saved did at the end of the episode).

The real tragedy of the episode is the fate of the 4022 people they released from the library.  First, if Donna's experience was a standard example of their experience, then by releasing them they broke up thousands of couples.  Next, it took them a century to get released and so everyone they knew on their home planets would be dead or gone.

true,LokianEule,mccoy,Time's Champion,"Toying with them? Nonsense. I assume that 11, like any other incarnation, ""avoids the question"". The Doctor tried to warn Rory. But what was he going to do? He said it many times, but he couldn't do more than just tell Rory. It was only until they were back at the TARDIS and the Doctor was physically there to intervene that he was able to give Rory ""the ultimatum"". Either way, it was going to happen. The difference is, that at the end of the story, the Doctor was actually there to make sure it happened. There's no easy way to handle a situation like that.

And what was the Doctor's ""goal"" anyways? What's his agenda? What was he trying to accomplish, because it doesn't seem like he got anything out of this. He can't have been toying with them without some higher goal in mind.

I think that the Doctor's final look at the end could've been interpreted many ways. It wasn't pure menace- this is the Doctor we're talking about. He's definitely darker, but he always has good intentions at heart. It's a struggle between the trying to do good for the bigger and littler pictures.

I believe that Doctors like 2, 7, and 11 are Doctors who are prepared to do the unpleasant, and understand that sometimes there are no easy solutions or ""everybody lives"" situations. They are big picture Doctors. Again, this story was designed as a no-win scenario.

EDIT: 11 is prepared to do these things in a way 10 wasn't. 10 was still coping with his guilt, and he felt that he had to save everyone and make things better after the horror of the Time War. 11 is like a stage of acceptance- that things are not always going to be okay, and he has to re-learn to accept that.

However, the presence of the Doctor-centric moral ambiguity in *TGWW* is something that often gets overlooked, with the result being that Amy seems to act like a bitch for no reason. From her perspective, the Doctor breaks a promise, lies to her, and then effectively forces her husband to kill her. Despite his intentions, DocEleven does manage to be a bit questionable in his methods, and this episode focused a great deal more on that than seems to be present in the prevailing opinion on the episode.

Rory's cry of ""I don't want to travel with you anymore!"" acts as the main point of differentiation between Rory and the Doctor. Rory will always be there for Amy, maintaining a sense of moral duty in the process, while the Doctor has consistently failed Amy time and time again. The Doctor forcing the consequence of his actions onto Rory is a pivotal point in their relationship, and as Rory clearly states, ""This isn't fair. You're turning me into you!"".

The Doctor has needed to be (properly) made accountable for his actions over the past few years.

I do hear you, and I think that they're perhaps stretching the storyline further than it was intended, after all Nathan left and I would assume they'd contract their actors throughout any originally planned shows. I just hope they don't fuck it up as too many shows have.

I am with you that I hope that they don't drag it to a lingering death.

Age groups then are 17-25, and 35-45.

If my hypothesis on why older ""new drivers"" are safer is true, I would expect the older age group to be the main driver on considerably more expensive cars than the younger (at least a factor of 10 difference - so if the younger group is main driver on cars that average £1,000 value, I'd expect older drivers to average £10,000).

true,strolls,null,null,"&gt; Being able to pass a mickey mouse 45 minute test does not make you a good driver.

Driving tests are pretty good these days.

Although a number of the requirements are safe (and even legal) to ignore once you've passed, they will fail you for hesitating or sharp braking. 

When my mother drives she does things like braking heavily in steps, pushing down on the brake, releasing, and braking again, about three times as she approaches a junction, apparently because she doesn't have the coordination to brake smoothly all the way.

She'll approach a roundabout and come to a full stop because she sees a car is approaching to the right, even though it's so far away she could have just driven smoothly onto the roundabout and been through it, before it came near. To prove the point, having made this full stop, she'll realise she's got enough time to pull out, and will do so. So now not only has she has pulled out closer in front of the car than she needed to, leaving less stopping distances for the other vehicle and so on, but she has acted unpredictably and has thoroughly confused the other driver. That in itself is dangerous.

My mother would *never* pass the current test, not in a million years. I very much doubt lessons would overcome the hesitation and generally erratic behaviour she displays. I don't know if there is any way her driving abilities could be reviewed under current legislation (opticians and doctors are under a duty to report, and they're hot on it these days), but which of us would grass up our own mothers and have their mobility proscribed?

She has had only one accident that I can remember (say in the last 10 years, but probably longer) and that was ""not her fault"" because someone went into the back of her at a junction.

true,My_Thoughts,cnty-scotland,Scotland,"I grew up in Australia and voted there for a few elections.  The Australian system is really only slightly better than FPTP.  Yes you have to vote (Or to be correct you have to show up and have your name ticked off) however for the lower house (like the UK Commons) each electorate only elects 1 member.  By forcing people to vote you get large numbers of voters who always vote for the same party, either Labor (currently a party of the centre – and yes spelt that way) or the Liberals, a right of centre party.

To get elected you need 50%+1 of the vote with votes counted the same way as AV (or STV).  For some state elections you don’t need to number all the boxes but federally you must.  

The end result of all of this is Australian elections hang on the votes of a small number of swing voters in certain electorates, just like the UK. The upside is that  Australians can vote for smaller parties and assuming one of the major parties does not get 50%+1 of the vote in the first round of counting then their preferences flow to other parties.  But with single member electorates it really does not encourage political diversity.

To give an example I was living in an electorate for about 10-12 years.  Labor always won.  They would do a  little electoral work in the seat but they knew they would win.  The Liberals would do almost nothing, as they knew they would never win.  The Greens worked their butts off all year round – door knocking, street stalls etc and would come second.  The end result would be Labour would get the first 30-40% of the vote but as voters preferences flowed, the Liberal voters preferenced Labor and they would win and the person who went to Canberra really won 30-40% of the first preference vote.

One solution to this would be to merge 4-5 electorates and have each of these super electorates return 4-5 members using STV.

On both the left and the right side of politics Australia has seen parties win over a million votes federally and not gain a single seat (They do however get funding based on the number of votes they get).  My preferred solution to this would be a form of top up seats reserved for parties that win a certain percentage of the vote but still fail to gain seats.  I believe Denmark has a system like this.

Having an index of television content is a good start, but if you started linking it together with semantics, meta data and using references to create television versions of web style links then you can build a hierarchy of content.  Not only that, but you should be able to link it together with the web content that is available to you.

Before you know it, you are using this information in a live environment.  A breaking news story comes in and the news presenter has all the information that they need about it to hand, with video clips of related stuff to show.  A dynamically created landing page on the website will be created automatically with loads of things that you can do with the content.

Or a tv show comes on and they talk about a subject in it, up pops a link in the top right that says go to bbc.co.uk/whencanistop to find out about whencanistop subjects.

Of course, you can do the data analysis that they are talking about in the article too - working out which subjects get disproportionally large airtime, which ones don't and should get more programmes.
