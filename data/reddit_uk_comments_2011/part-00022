Well let me start with this. The whole Rory turning away from Smith while he was undressing being taken as homophobic is ridiculous. Rory is insecure of course he's going to turn. Amy's job as a Kiss-o-gram is really just Amy not being insecure. She loves Rory and later confirms this but the Doctor is her idol. Of course she has the hots for her. I love my girlfriend but I have the hots for Karen Gillan. She's an actor in my favorite show so I'm jelly while at the same time respectful of her. Amy's a terrible companion though. Rory is actually a far more interesting character but I digress. Her claims of sexism are there because she was looking for them. The advertising, sure, it was probably distasteful but Karen's hot and she knows it and doesn't seem to have a problem with hitting on herself so why not have some fun. Besides Madam De Pompadour, Sally Sparrow, Nancy, River. These are all females who kick a lot of ass. As for the homophobia that's bull shit. Captain Jack is a Moffat creation and he was gay in the empty child. So getting those out of the way. 

So on to somethings I got from this. She has a problem with realism. She LOVED Davis and she gave a lot of Tennant love which makes me think she's a Tennant fan girl. Fair enough he has amazing hair but as a Doctor he was rather boring for me. He was just so... human. That is honestly the best way to describe him. Eight has been credited as being the most human but he is also one of the darkest most brooding Doctors around. I digress yet again. Anyways I'm really calling shenanigans because she gave us half assed arguments and focused on the sexism she wanted to see. She doesn't like Smith and that's her problem. 

In the end she comes off to me as a child kicking a screaming that there was a changing of the guard and she didn't like Smith. She didn't see him for who he was. She wanted another Tennant and instead she got Dr. Seuss. I would argue this is a good thing. The Doctor is supposed to be alien he's supposed to be different. A human Doctor is boring thats why we have companions. We can relate to characters like River, Amy and Rory. (ESPECIALLY RORY! I love his character he's just so interesting to me.)  We could relate to Donna and Martha. (I HATED Rose. Tennant was oh so whiny about her.)  She wants a human Doctor so she pitched a fit but masked it as an ""academic"" argument.

i think that maybe that the pregnancy wasn't what the silence was referring to and it'll be something else entirely different. probably about his death and how he was the one who sent the envelopes or something that hasnt happened yet.

&gt;How did Canton get the TARDIS into area 51?

he didn't. the doctor or river put it there since they're the only 2 who know how to fly it. probably river since she still does have the time vortex manipulator so she could bring the tardis there and then leave without being seen.

&gt;How did the 1969 Silents all know Amy's name?

i'm guessing if you have the ability to wipe yourself from someones mind you also have the capacity to read their mind as well. and since they can do post hypnotic suggestion it could potentially explain amy's weird dream thing as well.

The Silence apparently need pilots for their homemade TARDISes. 
All the tested ""pilots"" in The Lodger were fried after they were tried.
The Doctor was recognized as a suitable pilot.
They influenced man to go to the moon, thus creating the space suit they needed that apparently keeps you from dying.
The little Timelord girl seems to've been being used by them, against her will, so she escaped and was suddenly dying as a result of leaving the suit.

Now I'm just gonna try to cohesively piece this stuff together. xD Perhaps it takes a Timelord, or the equivalent of one to fly their ships, but doing so causes them to start dying (Slower than the humans who were tested, though), hence why they needed the suit as a sort of life-support system. Not being a willing participant, the girl managed to escape, and her time as a pilot started to take its toll on her. (How she made it on the streets for 6 months is beyond me, as of now) She was obviously familiar with the regeneration process, though, which makes me wonder how old she really is? What if she really isn't an average little girl who somehow acquired Timelord powers, but is, in fact Jenny, the Doctor's ""daughter"" from a previous season where we know she has already regenerated at least once? Couldn't she have had a run-in with the Silence on her adventures and been captured by them once they realized she could be a pilot?

I dunno, I'm sorta making this up as I go along, and this is only one theory that's been going through my head. =P There are inconsistencies, obviously, like why she's really acting like a little girl (The space man's gonna eat me!) rather than a more mature, universe-traveled person, and all the pictures that were in the house of her at that young age, the one with Amy, etc.",0,1304227523,null,0,false,0,c1rtyps,t3_h18ft,t1_c1rtyps,t3_h18ft,1427108620,2,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,2

If they were doing it themselves to keep a actual tally, you would expect them to do it neatly along their arms for easier counting in the future -- definitely not on their faces. Even when we knew they were writing on themselves, the way they were scrawled all over the body still confused me.

They couldn't look at themselves to make a nice neat tally because as soon as they did they'd forget. So they had to mark themselves wherever they could be sure to see it again. That makes arms, and then once you run out of room on your arms and hands then you move to the face. 

&gt;why was it only the FBI agent who forgot? Once the hologram disappeared surely they should have all forgot?

They all forgot what the Silents looked like when the hologram disappeared. They managed to remember that they were there but not what they look like.

&gt;Not to mention, why didn't any of Silence use their power?
That scene happened very quickly. It seems like it takes a bit for the Silents to ramp up their power (maybe some sort of electrical current).

true,smileyman,smith,Smith,"&gt;Moffat wants us to think the girl is the daughter of the Doctor and Amy, which means she probably isn't.

My first thought was not that it was the daughter of the Doctor and Amy but the daughter of River and the Doctor

&gt;The Silence manipulate humanity into inventing a space suit they can use as life support for the girl. Why? To stop her from dying and therefore regenerating? Were they scared of what she would become?

If she's half Time-Lord (either from the Doctor and River or the Doctor and Amy), any race in the universe would A. be terrified as to what she might turn out to be, and B. want to control any possible science that might develop from that.


&gt;Where does the alien tech come from?

Presumably from other planets. Other races have fled the Silents before. We don't know how long ago that was, and it's possible that their are still Silents out there.

&gt;The ""stupid face"" scene reaffirms the bond between Amy and Rory. Then we have the ""why didn't you tell Rory?"" Scene which... does the same. Moff, you're setting us up for a fall.

I sure hope not. Rory is one of my favorite all-time characters in Doctor Who


&gt;River is becoming a tragic character. The ""there's a last time for everything"" scene was heart rending. Nice acting Alex.

She was tragic the first time we met her. Now it's even worse. At the end of this season I plan on going back to watch the Silence in the Library and sobbing.


&gt;The Doctor is reluctant to defeat the Silence, even to the point of leaving Amy sobbing in terror for days. What happens to change his mind?

They jumped to the rescue right after the Doctor and Rory had the conversation about Rory's memories. 

Doctor: Do you remember it all

Rory: No

Doctor: You're lying

Rory: Of course I am

Doctor: How do you deal with it?

Rory: Sometimes I can shut it off so I forget about it all. At that point there was a real look of understanding on the Doctor's face like ""Finally, someone else who can understand!"" Immediately after that we cut to them rescuing Amy.

&gt;The Silent TARDIS in the lodger. The Doctor described this as abandoned and said ""I wonder why?"" I take this to be sarcasm, he knew that it was abandoned because he defeated them in 1969. How many of these ships are there though?

There's no reason for him to know that he defeated them in 1969. The events in 1969 were still in his future timeline, even though they were in the past for everyone else. The TARDIS in the Lodger looked to be in much better shape than the one in Day of the Astronaut which makes me think we've not seen the last of it.

&gt;This wedding meant a lot to a lot of people. I don't know why but it did.


If you don't mind an American popping into this subreddit I can shed some light on at least an angle from here...


Here, at least, we don't have many longstanding, non-annual, ""something good happened!"", everyone gets the day off type celebrations. The ones we *do* have that are annual are usually celebrated individually. So it's an interesting thing when we hear about an *entire country* rallying around and celebrating a singular event. The neat thing about the wedding was it was basically a continuation of a tradition which at any point in time could be cut off forever, but it's kind of rejoicing in the fact that this was triumphant moment in continuing it. In America we have absolutely NOTHING comparable.


We also don't have that much exposure to any culture outside our own either. I realize there's a ""variety"" within America but having visited most of it I can tell you it's nothing comparable to your ability to spend about 90 euros for a roundtrip train ticket and see Paris. An equivalent trip with that kind of money here and you go from Iowa City, Iowa (flat, lots of corn) to Omaha, Nebraska (flat, lots of corn, but a zoo!). I really don't think too many people here have ever really even left the country before. So whenever there's a big event going on in another country (especially one that speaks our language) we get all giddy.


Lastly, the world is in shitty shape at the moment. So when a bunch of people want to get together and celebrate a ceremony commemorating two people *in love* that's something to get excited about. I think that's why it *meant* something to people, everything else was just what sparked their interest.",0,1304240263,null,0,false,0,c1rujh2,t3_h056d,t1_c1rujh2,t1_c1rmkj7,1427108891,4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,4

Time to come to the library.  You even gave me your screwdriver.  That should have been a clue.

I don't buy that the Doctors time line is exactly opposite of River's.  Otherwise this would be literally the second time he would have met her.  He showed up with a new haircut and a new suit, which makes sense following the doctor, he'd become the 11th, but from River's point of view, it would have had to been new backwards in time.  He showed up to her doorstep or maybe prison cell, which would be the first time he ever had been there.  Sometime after the becoming the 11th doctor, before ""Time of Angels""  The Doctor looked up where she was, which happens to be her cell, but he learned she was in jail in Angels, and took her out on this date.  I don't buy it.    And the fact that he got emotional over the meeting means to me at least that he knew her more than just in passing.

true,[deleted],null,null,"He knows he will have to deal with it someday. The Doctor has *never* been as clueless as he sometimes seems. In fact the bumbling around and trying to get out of dealing with anything too serious has always been a hallmark of the Doctor's character right back to the beginning. He wants to explore and have fun and if he can help someone out or save a planet, sure why not, but I think, especially after being Ten, he is sick of epic universe-shaking events, tired of big mysteries that threaten his existence and just wants to go back to being the lovable space/time hobo without a care in the universe, but he can't, not forever anyway. The web of time is now his problem alone because there is no one to step in anymore, and try as he might he can't avoid that responsibility. So I think we will see the Doctor maniacally self-assured and happy in the episodes that don't tie in directly with the larger story arc and we will see his darkness and anger (LOVED it in last week's ep. He somehow managed to evoke both Doctors Four and Seven, who did powerful anger best, even though neither of those Doctors ever were ever angry for quite the same reason) more as he is led by both his own sense of right and wrong and the web of time itself down the path where this arc is leading.

All this is not to say he never did things that hurt/killed people. Off the top of my head, he aided UNIT in destroying the (first batch of) Silurians when it was painfully obvious that they were not *all* bad guys.

The first Doctor was more violent before he met his first human companions (whom he tried to maroon on another planet and time at one point) who helped turn him from a crotchety Time Lord into the heroic Doctor we're so familiar with.

I was just remarking that, taken as a whole, the Doctor starts out very much not wanting to ever hurt even a fly and pretty much avoids doing so the vast majority of the time. But that would make for very boring television, especially these days, so the general theme is that he crosses the line sometimes, and by this point the line is so blurry he can't even see it anymore. And since the producers have been hitting the viewers in the face with that theme since at least the early 1980s, you'd think most of us would have that figured out by now. My above post was to sort of agree with you but also to sort of give examples of why you see the comments you refer to. The vast majority of classic Who has the Doctor trying to avoid violence at almost any cost. Even he admits that it doesn't go as far these days, ""I'm so old now. I used to have so much mercy.""

edit: Also, not sure if the Doctor ever called himself a pacifist but I know he was called one about 200 times in the classic series, usually by extremely militant military types and guerilla resistance leaders because he used to always always always try to reason with someone before he went against them.

eidt 2: Also forgot to point out that the Daleks and the Cybermen are special cases since they are basically hardwired to be evil. You can't ever feel sorry for them because they can't ever feel sorry for you.

The force used definitely wasn't overboard, but I don't think the police should have got involved. I think they should have continued what they had been doing all day, and keeping the perimeter in check. The officers that attended at first were very small in number (about 4 of them) and were in standard uniform, no riot gear at all, which does indicate that when they first stepped in they weren't planning to shut the whole thing down.

The little girl is Amy and Rory's daughter who has absorbed the time vortex and has become a time lord.

the daughter is also River. She becomes River at the end of the episode (or possibly another regeneration is needed.) As their time streams travel in opposite directions, the doctor witnesses her get younger and younger, eventually meets her as a child, knowing everything about her and telling her she's a time lord. This also explains why he has such a strong attraction to her even though he's only known her for a very short amount of time.

She eventually realizes that in order for any of this to happen, she has to kill the Doctor, the greatest man she's ever known. When she fires at herself in 6-01 she does it because she wish she could take it back, regretting having done it in the first place. She figures she can rewrite time but ""of course not"" she remembers the suit protecting her. Also, this is why she knows that how she died in FOTD would kill the Doctor as well, because if she is a time lord then what can kill her can certainly kill the Doctor.

  *The Doctor's which is moving along linearly or him
  * River's which is moving linearly for her

Both of their timelines, while perceived by them to linear in relation to their own lives, are completely disjointed when viewed by us because they are time-travelers. This is the reason for the journal. 

This is a bad analogy but think of a set of twins. One of them is an astronaut, the first one to travel at lightspeed and too the edge of the solar system. The other remains on Earth. When astro-twice comes back from his week's worth of travel, the one on the Earth has aged ~100 years. Basically this is the theory of relativity. Time is relative to your speed in it.

In this case, picture time as a piece of paper and write the name, ""Doctor"" on it. Got it? Good. Do the same thing with another piece of paper but write, ""River"" on it. Put the two together and wad them up. Both are the same piece of paper that they started out as but now they touch in sections and not touching in others.

true,HarryBlessKnapp,eng-GreaterLondon,South Weezey Mandem,"What do you think the cause of crime becoming politicised could be? I mean civil disobedience is needed to take our species forward at times. There comes a point where it is necessary for the law to give in e.g. interracial marriages, homosexuality, suffragettes, slavery. I mean would you have condemned all of these protests as examples of crime becoming politicised? Because I'm not sure that's the sort of world you would like to live in.

These politicised crimes you are speaking of, how many people were charged and convicted? Not a lot. I think that points towards politicisation of the police. Because that would imply that they are not solving crimes, but merely disrupting protests. If they had a high conviction rate for these arrests, I would be entirely inclined to side with you, as this would be evidence that the police were dealing with criminals in these instances.

Under your last point, or how I have interpreted it, you would have had the police stop a lot of protest that led to the improvement of our society via political means. If you do not think that points towards a politicised police force, I don't know what does. It seems a bit anti-democratic to me.

edit: Effectively, when civil disobedience reaches a certain level, it means the law is wrong. You have given me much food for thought. Are the police furthering the cause of the protestors? And is the politicisation of crime/the police force necessary for/an indicator of social change? You have gone from worrying me, to giving me much to be positive about. I think all of these arrests are a sign of the winds of change. I like your style.

However, protesting within the law, is not civil disobedience. Arresting people for this is surely a sign of a politicised police force and not of politicised crime. E.g. Conspiring to make ironic comments with a megaphone. There are a few worrying examples of this, but once again I now feel that this will be a contributing factor to social change.

This also shows that whatever happens next in the story, it has to take place:

- Probably before River's time in Stormcage
- Before the 'future' Doctor's death in ""The Impossible Astronaut""

In other words, my speculation is that River is the one killing the Doctor in ""The Impossible Astronaut"", shortly after first meeting him (because it would be the Doctor's last meeting, the reverse of ""Silence in the Library"").

Or perhaps we should be tackling the problem at the source, by, you know, actually listening to protesters and not making stupid, elitist decisions, so people aren't so inclined to smash shit up.

Whilst there will always be a destructive element, the black bloc cannot function without the rest of the public being their to keep them in the shadow. So government should look at tackling the reason people are there as opposed to fucking everyone and then beating up those who complain.

Most of the people they arrest have done fuck all wrong, are released without charge, or hassled and have their stuff retained for evidence. All this does is make otherwise peaceful people more agitated at marches and more likely to be aggressive.

I agree.

&gt; and not making stupid, elitist decisions, so people aren't so inclined to smash shit up.

Because you do not agree with a decision does not give you a right to ""smash shit up"". 

&gt; Most of the people they arrest have done fuck all wrong, are released without charge, or hassled and have their stuff retained for evidence. All this does is make otherwise peaceful people more agitated at marches and more likely to be aggressive.

If most people are released without charge and have done nothing wrong then I would agree there is plenty of scope for investigations in to police behaviour and perhaps setting boundaries of behaviour more clearly.

So is assault on innocent people, but I don't see any police in cuffs.

&gt; Businesses have a right to operate, another poster in this thread put it better than I will, but if people are actively breaking the law by smashing stuff up then yes, the police should use reasonable force to stop them.

We have a right to protest. And I think freedom of speech is a little more important than protecting capitalism.

&gt; I agree.

Cool.

&gt; Because you do not agree with a decision does not give you a right to ""smash shit up"".

I personally don't, but what options do a disillusioned populace who feel that their votes mean nothing, who feel that their country is governed by people who put their mates first, the people second, who feel that their MPs don't listen, and the people they voted for who claimed to bring change simply lied and turned tail on major issues. Who are starting to realise that Capitalism only ""works"" for a small percentage of the global population. There are so many reasons and huge things at stake here that yes, though I don't do it, I think a broken window or a water-soluble paint bomb or ten, are tiny prices to pay if it's the only voice a lot of people have.

&gt; If most people are released without charge and have done nothing wrong then I would agree there is plenty of scope for investigations in to police behaviour and perhaps setting boundaries of behaviour more clearly.

Yep, it'd be amazing to see this happen. The police are the government's dogs, and they need them *badly* at the moment. Of course the government is going to sweep their shit under the rug and let them bite a few people. Why would you muzzle the only thing protecting you?

&gt; Unless the law changed I believe squatting is illegal.

It's grey area, and this is clearly politically motivated, as the squats are used by protesters to stay over before protests. Which is fine in my books.

&gt; If you're referring to [1] this I do agree it sounds heavy-handed but given there was a security zone in place due to the wedding the move was clearly intended to generate a response from the police or press coverage.

Were they a threat to the security of the wedding? I think not. The police clearly just didn't want anyone making the royals look bad. Despicable.

&gt; why?

&gt;Mainstream media is generally owned by someone with a lot of money, so they're never gonna admit that the whole monetary system is based on rules that are inherently false.

&gt;The mainstream media networks are trying to keep it under wraps as much as possible through distractions. The Royal Wedding proves to be a useful albeit short lived distraction.

You're suggesting that the media is complicit in some global scheme to rob us all. This is utterly ridiculous. The media is made up of thousands upon thousands of people trying to gather news in an even more chaotic environment. There are so many conflicting motives, intentions, manipulations, and external factors, it is mad to think that there can be such a level of co-ordination to ensure blanket conspiracy.

The problem with you lot is that you make the same errors of reason that fooled the media, and the people into supporting the Iraq war. We all know that the chain of events needed for Saddam to attack the west with a WMD was so stupidly complex and convoluted that it was spectacularly unlikely, but thanks to a great deal of PR, fear led us to believe that invasion was necessary to ensure survival. You make these stupid assertions that powerful people are working together to control and repress humanity to further their desires, but the fact is that organisation on this scale is ludicrous. Things go wrong, yes, people do stupid or greedy or cruel things, people want money, importance and power, but ultimately even the largest of corporations are just one variable in a sea of millions.

I can understand the want to do something, the fear, the feeling that you are 'joining the dots', but nothing is as simple as that. Our brains are evolutionarily wired to look for the simple answers, to make gut assumptions without thought for actual probability. I would urge you to really question some of the things the Zeitgeist movement says, extricate yourself from the net of confirmation bias. It is all too easy to blame those with power for the problems in the world, but don't forget, everyone makes mistakes and human beings are not inherently rational creatures.

&gt; that does not mean it is ok to vandalise things. Two wrongs dont make a right.

The police are an organised, communicating force with a well defined power heirarchy. Such is that they are responsible as a whole for their actions. Protesters are just a bunch of people who turn up. Individual protesters cannot be held responsible for other protester's actions. Thus, it is not ok to hit loads of random people because a small minority through bottles. We actually have crazy right wingers suggesting we should be enacting citizen's arrests. Lol.

&gt; I get you are anti-capitalist and that's fine. But damaging other peoples means of living is not and should not be acceptable. If you wish to protest great - I support that.

The places vandalised were that of giant institutions who they themselves are not without fault. It isn't like someone's walking in and smashing up some tiny family run business. I have little sympathy. For instance, Fortnums was peaceful, at least on the inside.

&gt; Ok, don't want to start a whole different argument, but there are other avenues than destroying other peoples property.

I agree that it is way too soon for vandalism and active revolution, but then on the other hand, protests are ignored, and now protesters are being rounded up! So what other action is there? Writing to MPs gets you ignored, direct action is great, but a movement about something so big needs lots of of different methods to achieve their goals.

&gt; No, probably not. And I did agree that the police were heavy handed, but said picnic would have been a lot more boring and got a lot less publicity had the police done nothing.

Not really, I'd prefer to go to a zombie picnic and eat stuff dressed as a zombie as opposed to being arrested and detained for fucking ages for no reason.

""Heavy handed"", whilst correct, doesn't go far enough to illustrate quite how abhorrent the police tactics are.

&gt; Sure, but comparison are still valid. Also, you never cease to hear phrases like ""police state"" and ""similar to north korea"" and what not thrown around, so if they are making those comparison then perhaps so should others.

I don't generally compare to other countries other when it's a direct parallel. However, police state we are definitely moving towards. Surveillance state we've had for a very long time.

&gt;You're suggesting that the media is complicit in some global scheme to rob us all. This is utterly ridiculous.

Ok I don't think they're doing it consciously, I don't think that the media are complicit in some conspiracy and they are all co-ordinating together to ensure a blanket conspiracy. It's just an outcome of the monetary system. 

If our brains are ""evolutionary wired"" to look for the simple answer then why have we created an economy that is of the magnitude that we have today. It's so complicated that we just have to make up rules to get us out of the shit when we need to / print more money

My opinion is that a collapse is occurring right now - evidence is everywhere - there's little point arguing over it. It's happening and if you can't see it then you have to start to question why you can't see it.

Thanks :) I'm not too bothered about the downvotes, it's a shame people cannot engage in debate without being so petty, but meh, no-ones dying because of it.

&gt; Protesters are just a bunch of people who turn up. Individual protesters cannot be held responsible for other protester's actions. Thus, it is not ok to hit loads of random people because a small minority through bottles. We actually have crazy right wingers suggesting we should be enacting citizen's arrests.

I see your point but there are a minority who are organised trouble-makers. In crowded, densely populated areas there are bound to be side-effects. The best result all round would be to stop the trouble makers from being their in the first place. 

If, to take a contrived scenario, the police did nothing and the bottle throwers started injuring the innocent bystanders (deliberately or accidentally) what should the police do?

The majority of protesters manage to protest relatively peacefully most of the time.

I am not expert on crowd control but it is clearly not a simple thing. 

&gt; The places vandalised were that of giant institutions who they themselves are not without fault. It isn't like someone's walking in and smashing up some tiny family run business. I have little sympathy. For instance, Fortnums was peaceful, at least on the inside.

We're never going to agree on this issue. However, vandalism is a crime regardless of who owns the property. 

Where do you draw the line between a family business and an ""evil capitalist""? Acting outside of the law turns people who may be sympathetic towards the cause to harden against it.

&gt; So what other action is there?

Form political entities and campaign. The Greens managed to get an MP, which is not a lot but it is a start. It is much easier to get on to councils. 

If you (collective) break the law then what do you expect? People to all of a sudden think ""shit! they were right."" and change over night? 

&gt; Not really, I'd prefer to go to a zombie picnic and eat stuff dressed as a zombie as opposed to being arrested and detained for fucking ages for no reason.

Well, if you think about it, people being hit by bottles are likely to be at the front. So the current police tactic of rushing those very people is kind of a failure. In all honesty though, the majority of bottles are only thrown *when* the police get involved, or by groups of people that break away from the crowd to do it (black bloc), so there's very little danger from other protestors, really.

&gt; Where do you draw the line between a family business and an ""evil capitalist""? Acting outside of the law turns people who may be sympathetic towards the cause to harden against it.

When they fuck over other people for their own gains. If the government isn't going to prosecute these assholes, are we supposed to just sit back and let them screw everyone? Banks have been jerks for far too long.

I said I wasn't in favour of this sort of action at the moment, as there has to be far more widespread anger. Vandalism can work, but it has to be done at a point where people are boiling over already. Doing it now is just like climaxing 12 seconds into sex.

&gt; If you (collective) break the law then what do you expect? People to all of a sudden think ""shit! they were right."" and change over night?

Time to come to the library. You even gave me your screwdriver. That should have been a clue.  

If they are living literally backwards, that would imply that he tracked her down between Forest of the Dead and Fall of the Angels to take her out on a date to spend a magical evening together so he could give her his screwdriver and cry.   Which wouldn't make sense as this would be the second time he met her.  So the Doctor shows up with a new haircut and a suit to her doorstep, which is probably the prison because we haven't seen her escape between then and now, but he doesn't know she was in prison because he learned that on the Byzantium.  Unless she escaped but then it's not really her doorstep.  And before people say ""new haircut and suit, she's refering to the 11th doctor, he has a new haircut, and that silly suit""  but this is the first time she'd ever seen 10, so if she's living backwards it would have been new for her, which means that he actually dressed up and gave her his screwdriver.

Seeing as the Police didn't arrest everyone in Soho square who was actually protesting, but people minding their own business getting coffee in fancy dress implies it wasn't an arrest related to protesting in general, but more likely to do the particular group of protestors who had been planning to protest all zombified.

true,TheAuditor5,null,null,"&gt; Please show me the economics primer that states that humans can defy the laws of physics. The infinite growth paradigm is currently trying to defy these laws, and this is why it is failing. It's as simple as that.

Growth relies on the availability of resources. For all intents and purposes, resources and energy can be assumed to infinite in the universe (they're not, but the human race will be long gone when we get to that point).

So what happens a particular resource is becoming scarce and no longer immediately available? Well, the same happens when we encounter any other problem, we engineer a solution; in modern systems this is usually motivated by an increase in commodity price. This can mean making better use of a resource, finding more of it or replacing it. Admittedly, this may be a painful process, but it is also very drawn out so the burden is spread over generations. Since scientific development is accelerating and a global affair, we are constantly working towards the next 'technological paradigm'. So as a whole (ethical issues aside), humanity shouldn't fear resource crises. From an individual level, as distasteful as it may be, the experience may vary from having to pay more at the pump, to having your home seized by corporate paramilitaries, but civilisation will not fall into the abyss.

Which is why I find the Zietgiest movement so annoying (as well as the rothschild/jew bashing): it paints the fable that individual, malign influences will cause the human race to descend into chaos, attacking the rich and powerful as architects of this downfall, rather than attacking the shitty ethics and greed, things that all human beings are capable of. That **is** the architect of the suffering. The rich and powerful do not have a monopoly on poor morals.

&gt; If our brains are ""evolutionary wired"" to look for the simple answer then why have we created an economy that is of the magnitude that we have today. It's so complicated that we just have to make up rules to get us out of the shit when we need to / print more money

Our brains are wired for simple answers, but that doesn't mean we aren't capable of understanding complexity. My point was that 'jumping to conclusions' is a remnant of our evolutionary heritage and hence why it is all too easy. It also explain why fear is such an excellent motivator - the brain doesn't give a damn that the odds of you being attacked in the dark are low, fear makes you disregard the more sophisticated part of the brain and go with the gut feeling. This explains a lot of things from paedo-hysteria to the MMR-controversy. It's perfectly natural (and sometimes useful), but often misleading in modern civilisation.

&gt; My opinion is that a collapse is occurring right now - evidence is everywhere - there's little point arguing over it. It's happening and if you can't see it then you have to start to question why you can't see it.

The human race, at the advanced stage it is in, would not allow itself to collapse. We adapt, we change like we always have. We have the advantage of accelerated scientific development. People will suffer in the change, but people have always suffered and this is what we must address: progress without pain. We don't need to scream and rage at the financial system, blaming it for that suffering; the systems themselves are benign.

Sorry, but I think that's just a bit of a cop-out. 

I think that the society we live in at the moment is full of negative environmental influences that affect our phenotype, and I think the monetary system (at it's current stage) is fuelling these negative environmental influences. Just look at rates of depression and mental illness in western society compared with more natural forms of sustainable living.

It's more like an evolution in conciousness I guess. But you can't oppose a certain way of thinking with logic (as thinking is almost entirely subjective) 

So the people who hold these inherently flawed beliefs need to be opposed - it just so happens that the wealthy elite are the ones holding onto this archaic way of thinking.

You probably recognise this as the standard story about splitting the vote. The left have 35 + 25 = 60% of the vote so might hope to get a left-wing MP into Parliament.

The standard story is that the SDP voters have to vote tactically, to keep the Tory out.

But there is a non-standard twist to this. What if the Tories vote tactically, voting SDP to keep Labour out? Then it is safe for the SDP to vote naturally and their candidate wins. But what about the next election? Will Tories switch back, relying on the split left and get a Tory in? Will the SDP see it coming and vote tactically for Labour to forestall this?

Now, I think that either the woman is Amy's slightly altered version of River or of what she imagines  the little girl grown up as being.

OR! Hang with me. I have a second theory.  I believe that Amy has a time baby.  A baby that can time travel without a vehicle.  Which is why the doctor's equipment was going funny: The baby was travelling forwards and backwards in time in Amy's womb.  So, maybe, this woman is an image of the future.

Moffat has taken the idea of a series arc and amped it up 110%. It can be very dissatisfying to all, except real fans, to watch 2 episodes and have more questions raised than answered. It becomes much more difficult for a casual observer to pick up the show and enjoy it because even standalone episodes get injected with stuff that makes no sense unless you've seen every episode.

I give approximately less than one fuck what voting system we have; they all have different disadvantages and advantages.

But I will say that your arguement is inherently flawed in that - in order to demonstrate that AV is simpler than FPTP - you have explained AV in the simplest terms possible, and FPTP in the most complicated.
It's a potentially good point made in a flawed/polemic fashion.

The whole AV vs FPTP debate has been absolutely awful on both sides, &amp; after having read most of the official *No to AV* and *Yes to AV* campaign momvements' arguements, I ended up laughing.

The only sensible explaination I read was in the economist which basically said something to the effect that they're both inherently unfair in that they're majoritarian systems(ie, designed to over-represent the most popular party to get a strong government) but under AV if we were to have the 2010 election again it'd be around 16% of constituencies that decide the outcome, instead of the 13% under FPTP.

""They are not a Foundation for Renewable Energy, as their name says and as any reasonable person would conclude from their name – they actually exist to undermine Renewable Energy – in that respect their name is a deceit.""](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renewable_Energy_Foundation) It's the equivalent of citing a wingnut 'think' tank to tell us about climate change science. 

The REF has a long history of making shit up about wind energy in the UK. They did exactly the same last year:

* [A spokesman for RenewableUK, the trade body which represents the renewable energy industry, said all suppliers to the National Grid periodically were asked to reduce output to control the balancing mechanism. He said it was simply evidence of the growing part wind energy had to play in Britain's supply needs that turbines would occasionally be taken off the National Grid. He added: ""REF exists to misrepresent any piece of information and turn it into a scandal or crisis. The reality is the National Grid's job is to ensure we have adequate capacity to meet demand at any one time.""](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/earth/energy/windpower/7840035/Firms-paid-to-shut-down-wind-farms-when-the-wind-is-blowing.html)

Note that no one but the anti-wind lobby organisation confirms the *unbelievably high* figures claimed in this report. £308,000 for a ""few hours"" of non-production for a 322MW wind farm?! That must mean they can pay off the entire cost of the wind farm in a few weeks!

Also, the national grid spokesman ""confirmed that the National Grid spent £280m balancing supply and demand."" So, even if these massive numbers are true, a lot more money is spent elsewhere to pay for balancing supply and demand. In other words, this is normal operation for load balancing a grid.

Expect most of the claims in this report to be debunked by a credible source in the next few days.

tl;dr; more anti-renewable FUD and propaganda from NIMBYs and / or the fossil / nuke lobby.

Not at all, the whole point of capitalism is an innately selfish one. People do things for money and their own gain. Anarchy, a philosophy that I'd say I'm *interested* in lately, most specifically anarcho-communism, is a philosphy where things are innately done for the benefit of everyone as a whole.

&gt; You may as well as wait for Jesus, I seriously doubt we're going to see anything like the Miners strike in the 80s again.

You'd be surprised. I have maybe another 60 years left of life, a lot can change in that time.

the UK had no real gun control until after the world wars when it was seen as a bad thing by the government to have armed trained soldiers idle on home soil.

I can't answer that for certain.  My coworkers recommend shows to me claiming the shows have an arc.  Two of the three shows I watch are American, Boardwalk Empire and Castle, and both have some arc, but not to the extent that Lost did, and not to the extent that Moffat is doing here because there is no time travel in those shows.  The possibility of time travel disrupts the arc in novel ways.

Does the show *need* market traction in the United States to survive?  An attempt to win over the popular American audience could be an expensive gamble.  If the show concerns itself with pleasing existing fans, new fans will come naturally through word-of-mouth.  Doctor Who fans in the U.S. have already proven we will go out of our way to watch the show, no matter when or how it's broadcast.  Any new fan with questions can find answers online, like I did.

oil is going and we have no real idea when we will get to the point its too expensive to be used. this allown will stop so much of the stuff we use now not just fuel for cars/boats/planes most plastics lubricants and many many other products.

most rare minerals are being used rapidly for new electronic technology's.

food cost are rising and there is a limited supply of farming land which is reduced every year by more urban growth.

the human population is growing rapidly which will require more resources to be used each year.

the resources for profit system we have now will only ever increase the price as the resources get rarer there is no incentive to work for the grater good in a profit based system.

I haven't actually said the Police were right; but that they were legal.

If the legal arrests are considered in your eyes to be bad, then that's a job for MPs in Parliament to write, rewrite or rescind legislation.

It's an issue of a faulty legal system, even with a high level of Police corruption, the fundamental fault lies with the laws, not the upholders thereof.

Also, ""what happened to innocent until proven guilty?"" doesn't apply to arrests. **Arrests are not made based upon guilt**. Arrests are made when some amount of evidence exists that a crime has been/will be committed.
It takes surprisingly little evidence to legally justify an arrest simply because arresting someone effects their lives directly for the 24 hours that you can be held for. If the Police arrest you unfairly, then the CPS tell them it won't stand up in court, and the arrested suspect is considered innocent and let out.

In the OP, the image suggests that you have to vote tactically, whereas under AV you won't. I don't follow the logic because voters may still vote tactically if they think their least favourite candidate will get in.

Tactical voting happens under FPTP because it's a majoritarian system. As AV is still majoritarian, it's probably still going to have some degree of tactical voting.

Also, you say people ""simply vote for what they want"". With tactical voting, I assume voters vote instead of to support their favourite, they vote to oppose their least favourite.
In either case, it's voting for an outcome they want, just not what they necessarily *most want*.

Again to clarify, I'm not voting in the referendum because I don't which system we have as they both are majoritarian systems, but I also think anyone who waxes lyrical about either FPTP or AV as being superior is wrong.

Also they are not simply on Earth since the creatures from *Vampires in Venice* fled from the Silence.

Being a killjoy is enough is it not? Yes, they had a great influence in the development of human technology. However, how much human suffering was a result of their influence to develop that technology? It is not that the Silent brought peace and harmony during their time on Earth.

It is not necessary that the Silence leaving the Earth is a good thing. It could result in the destruction of the human race. This seems to be probable to me because of the whole ""Silence will fall.""

Further, in Impossible Astronaut, when the Silent vaporized Joy, it seemed as if he needed to do that in order to gain a voice, saying ""My name was Joy.."" as if it were new information to him.  This all seems to add up to the Silence *not* being psychic in the sense that they can read information from another persons' mind without vaporizing and absorbing them.

Well, if it had told him to do that, wouldn't he have remembered it next time?

Another theory about the ""Vampires"" being able to remember them is that they only wipe themselves out of Human memory. Perhaps something to do with the fact that they've been around since ""The Wheel and the Fire"", while they first showed themselves to the fishies when they invaded their planet. 

Canton knowing the doctor is dead is strange though, got no other explanation there.

Time travel to Galifrey (at a point before you last left there) was not just prohibited (see: The Five Doctors), it was actually made impossible by Rassilon when he constructed the transduction barrier around the planet. You can't destroy the barrier without destroying the planet and most likely yourself, and even then it would still be in place in the past, still keeping you out (see: Invasion of Time), so they'd have to do some serious gymnastics in their writing to keep nerds like me from writing a flood of strongly worded letters.

As you can see, the number is quite low and the majority of them were killed in circumstances where having a gun probably wouldn't have made a difference.

Compare this to a state in the US which is a similar size such as Michigan (although with about 1/7th of the population) and you can see the difference.

&gt;WHY'S IT ON YOUR MICROPHONE AND WHY'S IT ALL OVER MY TOWN IN OLDHAM?  
  
How many different ways could the guy explain it's the logo of 'Press TV' he even mentions 'it's a middle eastern TV channel..' but the guy shouts over him to ask the other reporters what channel their mics are from -obviously not that interested in making any form of argument against press TV or expressing any sentiment which suggests he knows anything about them.  The EDL guy has been told what TV channel the mic is for but he obsesses on the logo, maybe because as the video shows it's very similar to the oldham council logo?  

Either way you look at it there is no possible way that EDL guy is being more rational or 'coming off better' than the reporter when the 'facts' are considered - the reporter knew and stated it was the press TV logo - of course though he couldn't explain more than this because it's just a fucking logo - what does the reddit logo mean?  it's just a fucking alien it doesn't actually mean anything - if i was shouting at the mods demanding they tell me what it means what better answer would i get than 'it's the reddit logo - it's just a little picture thats sorta an icon thing for the webpage.'

true,YouLostTheGame,eng-GreaterLondon,Aberdream,"There are lots of forms of PR. The most obvious is the National List, used in Israel, where you just pick a party, but you have no constituencies. 

Then you have the Regional List, used for the EU and most of Europe, where you have large multi-member constituencies.

Then there's STV, used in Ireland, which again has large multi-member constituencies and uses preferential voting. The result is highly proportional and fair, but the process is way too long and complicated for me to go into at half one in the morning. (And for that reason probably too complicated for your average Joe and would certainly need computers to count votes - many people are weary of this).

My favourite - AV+, which is where you elect a local MP using AV, and then the rest of the votes are counted to create top-up MPs, who have no constituency link and make it so the share of the votes are proportional. Not used anywhere (AFAIK), but was outlined by the Jenkins report commissioned by Blair as the best electoral system for Westminster.

AMS - same as AV+ but using FPTP instead of AV. Used in Wales and Scotland for devolved Assembly/Parliament elections.

And those are the ones that I'm most versed in, but my point is that PR isn't always the simplest, and it's a pretty broad term to be bandied about as one system.

Right from this point you demean your own argument. His voice was raised, yes, but screaming? Seriously?

&gt;also for the sake of the world i have to tell you, stop being patronizing and saying things like 'learn when you are being led' it's a terrible debate tactic and it makes people instantly distrust you.

Oh, come on. Seriously? **For the sake of the world?** Really? Fucking hell, I don't think I've ever seen such a blatantly stupid sentence on reddit. Well done, you've exceeded all my expectations.

If you can't see that the flashing of the logos over the video is leading you, then you are already led beyond redemption. Why couldn't the video be left to speak for itself? Why did the guy posting it feel the need to tell us what he *assumed* the guy was referring to?

If you genuinely can't see that the video, instead of being left alone to carry it's genuine message, has been edited in such a way as to deliberately lead us to a certain conclusion, then you are already damned.

Bear in mind that 'press tv' means absolutely fucking nothing unless you already know exactly who they are. Does it tell you they are the official Iranian-funded press channel? No? I didn't know that 'Press TV' was an Iranian-funded tv channel. Did you? Should this guy be expected to?

bloke - ""What does that mean?""  pointing to 'press tv' symbol

reporter = ""I've got no idea""

rinse and repeat...

reporter - ""and what's your point?""

bloke - ""I want to know what that means"" pointing to symbol on microphone

reporter ""I don't know what that means"" The symbol of the press channel he is reporting for, yet he can't answer?

The pretty damn obvious problem is the guy does not understand that 'press tv' is an actual name of an actual press agency, and I don't blame him. 'PressTV' is such a stupidly generic name that if somebody told me (in broken english) that  they worked for 'press tv' I'd just assume they were telling me they worked within the press/tv industry, but were avoiding naming the specific agency.

Season five was more focused on the cracks, and season six is on the Silence (I assume they are responsible for the TARDIS eploding).

1,2: I believe it has been said that this will be resolved this season.

4: TARDIS blew up causing cracks in time. This leads to Prisoner Zero escaping, the companionship of the Doctor and Pond. Fast forward to everybody ganging up on the Doctor to prevent him from destroying the Universe. Which thus results in the TARDIS exploding because of whatever entity took control of it, and the Doctor not being able to stop it. Thus Timey wimey.

You have to look at the complexity of the story though. With all that Moffat is trying to do, I do not think you should expect him to be able to solve it all nicely in only 13 episodes. This maybe one reason why this season is divided like it is.

The bbc is quiet clearly state TV, it's independent and the royal charter protects our rights and yadda, yadda, yadda but it's far from being actually independent - i suspect you'd find that almost all the state TV channels in the world have a charter or some such which absolutely declares they're independent and free - you'd ignore every single word of it were it from the remit of Press TV so you simply have to accept that many other people around the world have a legitimate reason to question the BBC in the same light.  
  
Secondly and much more importantly what does it matter?  what does the funding of Press TV have to do with the answers the EDL loudmouth was giving?  
  
Did the EDL guy have a point to make to the press or did he have a secret he didn't want the arabs to hear about?

That's it. Supposedly, he's referring to the Richard E. Grant version from *Scream of the Shalka*, the Rowan Atkinson version from *Curse of the Fatal Death*, and the Eccleston version which had debuted about 3 months prior.

Mind you, I do agree with the OP: There is no such thing as Doctor Who canon, at least not in the traditional definition of the word.

In the upper echelons of Who-fandom, geekier geeks than I slice the word so thinly that you can see right through it - although most of the disagreement stems from overly OCD types who want a simple rule to be able to exclude some categories of things while still including the things they think should count, tossing out books and audio dramas because they contradict ""established canon,"" but blithely ignoring the show's own whopping contradictions. Why count *Mawdryn Undead* (which throws all of UNIT chronology out of whack), but not *War of the Daleks* (which throws all of Dalek chronology out of whack)? Why discount *Curse of the Fatal Death* (a tongue-in-cheek, officially licensed Doctor Who story broadcast by the BBC, and commissioned for charity) if you're going to include *Time Crash* (a tongue-in-cheek, officially licensed Doctor Who story broadcast by the BBC, and commissioned for charity)?

I've mentioned it before, but this is my number one problem with the majority of theories posted here. If we were discussing real life, it would make sense to acquire all the facts and extrapolate the most probable outcome from them. However, we're talking about a tv show. The most likely outcome is one that will be satisfying to the creators and their audience.

In some ways, that's a lower standard of believability - it doesn't have to mesh with an obscure fact from the 80s, although of course in real life it would have to. In other ways, it's a higher standard. Simply joining all the dots from a bunch of clues that most viewers will not have noticed is not going to be convincing to those viewers.

true,thegenregeek,null,null,"The counters I'd argue (gently) is that 1) Davros was pulled out of a timelocked era by Dalek Caan (granted new series), 2) for a brief time the Doctor was wiped from existence altogether and restored by Amy and 3) The entire universe was destroyed and literally rebooted last season by the Doctor's use of the Pandorica. (Complete with question of whether Rory is an Auton or fully human? I suspect human now, but with memories somehow)

Those elements in theory could free the writers to invent new reasons why Gallifrey, the Time Lords, and the entire Time War itself could have been altered. Perhaps it was timelocked in one reality/timeline, but suddenly the rules could have changed as the fundamentals of a new reality/timeline have/are taken root. (Hence the I've killed hundreds of Time Lords exchange seen in the S6 trailer could mean more... or not)

Hell, one idea I mentioned liking in another thread was the idea of the Time Lord civilization being wholly regenerated (along with that universal reboot), but without the Doctor having been a part of it. In other words what if the Doctor succeeded in bringing back his people, only to be considered a fluke/outsider to them? With the Timelords trying to stop him from mucking about in time because they just don't like/trust him as from their perspective he shouldn't exist.

In other words, in Moffat style, we could be seeing an effect before the root cause. Or a have a cause that hasn't caught up with us. (If Gallifrey were ever restored, would the Doctor bother to check?)

Who knows, maybe random nerd speculation that amounts to nothing. But the simple fact is I'm sure at some time some writer working on Who will find a way to bring back the Time Lords. Might as well figure they'll find a way to do it by bending the rules a bit and introducing some other story ideas.

true,elgordo78,null,null,"Look where the park and rides are, and then look at the areas recommended to avoid, and then work out which areas remain within walking distance of the park and rides.

Why?

Because there is going to be a parking charge on every company parking space a firm has, and chances are if you want to park at work they'll make you pay the annual fee. So might as well live near a main tram or bus stop.

For what it's worth I live in Beeston opposite the university and it's beautifully quiet except for ""Week One"" in late September, and the last week of exams in January and May, when those who have got theirs out of the way go a bit nuts. There's a main bus into the city for £1.60 each way, or £3.20 all day rider ticket, or you can buy season tickets. They run every ten minutes. There's 24hr supermarket in the middle of the suburb, and a train station on a main line out of (and into) town. The housing is relatively cheap because it's a mix of students and locals, and far enough out of town. It's close to the A52 and M1 motorway. All in all, I think it measures up as one of the better areas of Nottingham in which to live.

Oh, and I definitely agree about the Broxtowe estate. I was foolish enough to buy a house there in 2001, and stayed for 3 years. We had armoured CCTV poles with the cameras set so high that burning tyres beneath it wouldn't affect them, and they had an anti ram-raid base. There were armed mounted patrols in summer, a permanently stationed armed response car just off the estate, and regular patrol cars were rare - just those going to and from the station. Too dangerous to patrol regularly. In the time I lived there, there were 4 murders within 200 yards of my home including one that went down as being 'bored kids' in the end, and nobody was ever caught for it - and another where a man was stopped in his car at gunpoint, murdered execution style, and the car driven off and dumped nearby. No motive was established or perp caught. There were houses with 3 or 4 big flashy mercs outside dotted around, the owners clearly into mobile freelance pharmaceuticals.  So the Broxtowe estate - steer well clear.
(NB - don't confuse with Broxtowe Borough which has some leafy suburbs that are perfectly nice, and a good distance of several miles from the estate).",0,1304311741,null,0,false,0,c1rz7vy,t3_h1e3p,t1_c1rz7vy,t3_h1e3p,1427111160,3,false,nottingham,t5_2qmbu,3

She's not willing to risk finding out something negative by herself because that would be both difficult to do and/or hide from the others, but also difficult to cope with. It's easier to hide something if someone else can catch things you say that you shouldn't, or back you up instead of being suspicious like the questioning party.  

She's not willing to risk finding out something negative with Rory because if she's devastated and Rory's devastated it will have a reflective or multiplying effect on both of their feelings, may even drive them apart if they start trying to place blame, and that would be even more difficult to cope with.  

She is willing to talk to the Doctor because, not only might he have more information (about pregnant women in the TARDIS, or women in the TARDIS in general, or women in general, perhaps even Amy herself if he's done some time-travelling she isn't aware of yet and is willing to give info about it) and might be more suited to help, but because he's her best friend--he's emotionally invested in her, definitely, but not as emotionally invested in the baby as Rory would be.

Presumably, people who voted Lib Dem did, and namely they voted for PR.

Naturally, the Tories can't give too much voting reform, and the Lib Dems too little.
The AV referendum is the result of an action typical of coalition government - it's a compromise.

Also, ""they would only stand a chance arguing against AV"" is a fairly invalid claim.
There's a debate to be had about FPTP vs. PR, it's not clear cut and instantly visible as to which is better.
All electoral systems have various other advantages &amp; disadvantages that mean they're all kind of good, but also kind of shit too, just in their own unique way.

On another note, the reason every arguement you've heard so far is of ignorance or a blatent lie (actually a problem with both the official *No* &amp; *Yes* campaigns) is because AV &amp; FPTP are really similar. they're both constituency based majoritarian systems, where the difference comes at a constituency level.

The Silence said to kill them on site when it was talking to/being taunted by Badger (er I mean..whatshisname Mr. Delaware) it was mocking him. It said that they should kill them on site, pretty much if the human race ever knew what was good for them. We don't, hence the point of the jibe. 

The Silence chose Amy to tell the doctor because as far as the program showed us she was the first of the Doctor's companions to question them. 

Dunno why (Jenni?) decided to regenerate in front of the dude, maybe she was lonely, but she did say she was dying before she regenerated. 

Looks like the orphanage was where they set up one of their nests, or one of the places they kept the girl.

true,TheAuditor5,null,null,"The modern human being alive today is chemically no different from the stone-age man. 

&gt; I think that the society we live in at the moment is full of negative environmental influences that affect our phenotype, and I think the monetary system (at it's current stage) is fuelling these negative environmental influences. Just look at rates of depression and mental illness in western society compared with more natural forms of sustainable living.

There are negative environmental influences in any environment. Human society is itself a product of evolution, things our genetics make us tend toward are reflected in our civilisation. The monetary system is benign, the financial crisis was to do with people exploiting oversights and flaws in its regulation, a direct consequence of greed, a part of our survival instincts overly expressed in the modern age.

Understanding rates of depression and mental illness is a little more complex:  we can say that depression as a diagnosis has not existed for very long, so it is still something we are trying to get to grips with. We can say that increasing rates may just be due to a better diagnoses, and as a society we are not necessarily become more prone to it. The public may be just more aware of the condition. What I'm saying is that this issue is a large multi-variable issue that cannot be attributed to some sort of 'future shock'.

The problem with more natural forms of living is that they do not hook into and maximise utilisation of basic human traits, such as desire for importance, to ensure progressive development of our civilisation. The monetary system (fitting so perfectly with our genetic traits) works very well in providing incentive.

I think a lot of disillusionment in the way our economies and financial systems are structured stems from the recent financial crisis. These crises do seem to repeat, but every aspect of it was again a product of traits we all possess. People want money, a big house, and will happily accept a mortgage they realistically they can't pay back. Banks and investors will write policy to exploit this. The fraud is all an unfortunate side effect of our nature. 

The systems work well in ensuring technological development, ultimately, that's what they are there to encourage: investment, development and diversification. Control and regulation are necessary to reign in the overwhelming human desire to accrue wealth (=&gt;importance/power). Current disillusionment aside, the human race stands a better chance of tackling upcoming big problems with it, rather than without it.

As I have stated, we would do better to improve ourselves ethically and morally, to try and mitigate the damage such an intensive system can produce, to try to tame our nature.

Thirdly, they stood by in the last thirteen years while Tesco took over the country.      

Also, fuck the local people who are whining about Tesco moving in and shutting down their high street. Guess what? If you don't shop in the store they will leave. If you shop in local stores they will prosper. So why not vote with your wallets instead of violence?

&gt; The term police state describes a state in which the government exercises rigid and repressive controls over the social, economic and political life of the population. A police state typically exhibits elements of totalitarianism and social control, and there is usually little or no distinction between the law and the exercise of political power by the executive.

If you're suggesting that we are tending towards a police state because of a security zone setup for a public occasion involving high-profile targets then you are exaggerating greatly in my opinion.

If you're anti-monarchist/establishment/whatever ok, fine exercise your right to free speech like Republic and others do. The police were reasonably clear about the security zone and protecting the crowds from extremist bombs is a sensible precaution on their part.

Sure, the police made a meal of it and went over the top with regards to the zombie picnic but then how are they to know that everyone just wanted some fun. It only takes one person yo become a martyr to the cause and assassinate someone to kick off something even uglier.

It isn't just royals they do this for, they do it for all foreign dignitaries including those that we dont agree with. People/places who are targeted need to be protected - they have that freedom too.

The World Trade Center and then London were chosen because they are high profile targets. Equally, there are some that would happily kill a prime minister, president, royal and it is these few who fuck it up for the rest of us.

If, for example, there was 1 or 2 terrorist attacks a month within the UK think how it would affect everyone's life. Our society would soon break down and we would in all probability be living in the police state you most fear. 

The role of the police and security services is to stop these events from ever happening. It's not an easy job.

Like the death of Bin Laden there are certain things which you might label ""prestige kills"" which act as rallying points for a cause. The may be characterised as ""low-probability high-impact"" events. In that they wont happen very often but when they do the impact is significant. 

The royal wedding is such an event, as will the next coronation be. There may well be groups that plan and plot to kill a large number of people who would choose such an event to make their point. 

The police in charge may appear OTT because if they are not OTT and something goes wrong what happens? Another war? Muslims getting attacked by idiots in the BNP? 

How different would the world be if there was no 9/11? We will sadly never know. 

I agree that the terrorists have won in many ways. Our lives are now dictated by the unreal fear of terrorism. That little old ladies get searched at airports is ridiculous. But if the security profiled passengers like the Israelis do Muslims would understandably feel targeted.

The real joke is that anyone who was so minded could quite easily blow up a plane with goods brought from Duty Free once they are passed the so-called security. It may take a bit of planning but it wouldn't be hard. 

You forgot Zimbabwe. Another case were Western philosophy was abandoned in favour of saving money. Yes, all too often our foreign policy is dictated by economics and it is not something I am happy with. But then we don't have the resources to fight all the battles we should. If we can salve our conscience while also protecting our interests then I'll take it as a lesser evil.

I have no desire to see this country descend further from freedom and in to tyranny but to cry ""police state"" because a few zombies got arrested is to cry wolf and do a disservice to those that really are struggling in police states.

The system may be shit and have its flaws but there are those fighting and sometimes winning within the system. We should support them and not the likes of Chalie Veitch who want to be media (anti-?)celebrities and are more concerned with their own egos than with genuinely changing things.

The No2AV campaign, bankrolled by the right-wing press are allowed to spread lies and play dirty. I won't deny that the pro-AV campaigns have been a bit misleading either though.

I have a feeling that either (or both) 

1. This will come back to haunt the doctor. Either he'll realize that they couldn't get away and he just murdered an entire race, or it'll turn out that they were stopping something much, much worse. (It has been pointed out that they didn't seem _that_ bad. They needed a spacesuit for some unknown reason and they killed a woman for some unknown reason. Maybe they were mostly-helpful parasites, in a symbiosis sort of situation)
2. This isn't the end of The Silence. They have to avoid humans, sure, but they have tunnels everywhere, unknown technology, and they can wipe themselves from your memories. They could still play a very major part in the coming season. 

So really what I'm saying is: Yes, I felt that, but even moreso I feel that this is just the first part of a story. If it turns out we never see The Silence again and the doctor never comes to the realization of ""shit, I just wiped out an entire race"", then that would be quite unDoctorlike.

Once you've killed 4 or 5 Silents, you'll see a carcass and think, ""Oh, that's one of those things I forget about after I see them.  And I've killed a bunch recently.

Rosanna: We ran from the Silence. Why are you here?

Rosanna: There were cracks. Some were tiny. Some were as big as the sky. Through some we saw worlds, and people. And through others we saw silence. And the end of all things. We fled to a nation like ours. And the crack snapped shut behind us. Saturnyne was lost.

Prior to this other references to silence where not indicative of a force but potentially a metaphor for a catastrophe befalling the universe. ( From 'The Eleventh Hour')

The Doctor: You came to this world by opening a crack in space and time. Do it again. Just leave.
Prisoner Zero: I did not open the crack.

We have had minority governments who actually, in terms of # of votes, lost the election. The First party got 35% of the total vote and the opposition got 40%.

But think about what happened. Osama Bin Laden was an openly declared enemy leader in the ""war"" on terror, and even if you don't like the term war in this context he was nonetheless a person who I believe the US military had the right to pursue.

As yet, it seems he was killed in a firefight. He was not executed on sight, he was not murdered. He was killed in a combat situation in which, presumably, special forces were fighting because capture without violence was impossible.

This is how justice works sometimes. Osama bin Laden was, it seems, killed in a way that is fully compatible with any moral system that allows for an attempt to capture him in the first place.

If you so disapprove of people having a happy reaction to this outcome, you'd have to pass the same judgement on the wizarding world's reaction to the apparent death of Voldemort, celebration of the defeat of the Daleks, or any situation in which a victory involving the death of an enemy occurs.

If I vote, for instance:

Green 1, BNP 2, Monster Raving Looney Party 3, Lib Dem 4, Labour 5, Con 6. It's obvious that none of my first 3 parties are getting into power, so what actually happens to those votes? Do those people get a proportion of the parliament representative of their votes?  Or do you always end up with the person who gets the most ""Oh I guess they'll do"" votes getting enough seats to make a stable govt, and the 2nd place party getting the rest of the seats?

Also what happens if I vote:

Green 1, MRLP 2, Lib 3, Lab 4, Con 5, BNP [no vote]? I've seen that this is possible, but does my vote actually go down as an abstaining vote, or even a vote specifically against the BNP? If enough people abstain does that mean a reelection is called? I've heard a lot about how this is a system that will never lead to reelections...

If Lib Dems make it into power, will they actually take the next step and hold a referendum on the Proportional Vote?

Will my MP be the person that I voted for?

Finding a place to stay; as others have said places like gumtree and spareroom websites are great.

Rent-wise you obviously get what you pay for; without bills for a half-decent place I'd look at about £100 as a starting point. Any less than that and it might be a bit of a shit-hole.....however cheaper places (especially in house-shares) do exist so don't discount them out of hand!

Buy a house? Forget it. Even if you had the 10% deposit £12,000 pa will in no way pay for that. Rent my friend it's all good.

£12,000pa in London you definitely can survive on. It's not great but it is doable. Obviously this depends on how much rent you're paying.

On that note; choosing where to live is VERY important. As your two biggest expenses are going to be rent and travel. So for example; if you find a great place but it's £130 p/w but it's in Zone 1 you'll pay a LOT less for travel.

3. Advertising in the same place(s) you looked for a room in. Better yet find someone suitable from your new social circle.
4. It's more expensive than anywhere else.

It depends, obviously, on how other people vote. There's no way of knowing which will be the 'last' one counted, which is why you put them in order.

&gt;Green 1, MRLP 2, Lib 3, Lab 4, Con 5, BNP [no vote]? I've seen that this is possible, but does my vote actually go down as an abstaining vote, or even a vote specifically against the BNP?

Sorry, I didn't realise you didn't know how it worked.

Basically it's *effectively* like having multiple votes in a row... Each time, the candidate with the fewest votes is removed, and everybody votes again. So if your favourite candidate was removed, you'd get a chance to pick again. Or not. You should never put in a vote for a candidate you don't mind winning.

Now, that would require lots of expensive elections. So, you put them down in order of preference and the system uses that to decide where you would vote once your favourite candidate is removed as the least favourite, and your second favourite, etc.

&gt;If Lib Dems make it into power, will they actually take the next step and hold a referendum on the Proportional Vote?

It's unlikely they will even gain seats given their current actions.

&gt;Will my MP be the person that I voted for? Right now I'm in a very stable Lib Dem seat (RtHon Alan Bieth) so if I vote for Lib Dem, but Lib Dems only get some seats, will my MP always be what I (or my constituents) voted for?

Yes, absolutely. AV is a way of choosing the MP that represents a certain constituency. It is not a proportional system and you are voting for a regional representative (the person; they just happen to belong to a party)

First off, I believe the subliminal order lasts indefinitely.  You see the moon landing video once, and from then on, any time you see a Silent you believe you should kill it on sight.

As to whether a solitary human could take one, I'm not so confident in the abilities of a Silent in a brawl.  Yeah, they can do the lightning thing, but they need to charge up, and it seems like that takes time and concentration.  There's also a decent chance they aren't built for physical combat; with the other defenses they have, they wouldn't need to be.  So if you just leap on one and start wailing on it, I think you've got a good chance.  

But really, the point is that The Silence are kept out of the seats of power.  They can't move through crowds, they can't go anywhere where people are armed.

In this situation, if the Green Party have the least votes after the first round (or any round), then your vote will move to the BNP. If the BNP are eliminated next, then your vote moves to MRLP or whoever is next that is still participating. You don't have 6 votes, you have 1 vote. But your vote is moved to a different party if your 1st choice doesn't have enough support.

&gt;Green 1, MRLP 2, Lib 3, Lab 4, Con 5, BNP [no vote]

No, it doesn't mean you abstain. It just means you refuse to vote for them and so your vote will never count towards the BNP if (for some bizarre reason) they are one the last party left.

You don't have to rate every single party, only the ones that you'd want to have your vote if your 1st choice fails. For example, a Green supporter would never want the BP party, the Shell party or the Kill the Whale Party to have their vote, so they leave them out. 

This is important to rememeber, as in your 1st example you rated all 6 parties. Only rate the ones you have any wish to see in government for whatever reason. 

&gt;If Lib Dems make it into power, will they actually take the next step and hold a referendum on the Proportional Vote?

As it seems you're looking to go on the MSc conversion course at Bristol (I was briefly on one of the Advanced MSc's) I would highly recommend looking through the programme structure on the CS department website as all the information a student will need is on there. You'll want to get a decent Java book and a C book; [Thinking in Java](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Thinking-Java-4th-Bruce-Eckel/dp/0131872486/ref=dp_ob_title_bk) is the best Java book I've read, but it can be quite tricky to pick up. As mentioned in the top post Java Software Solutions is the main UWE Java book and it's fantastic for beginners, but is a bit wishy-washy if you're really into the why, rather than the how. In regards to C the definitive book is [The C Programming Language](http://www.amazon.co.uk/C-Programming-Language-2nd/dp/0131103628/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1304368975&amp;sr=1-1). It's a small reference, but it's so concise and it was what most lecturers at both UWE and Bristol were keen to push on students.

Finally, there are plenty of girls on the conversion MSc (if anything, far more CS girls at Bristol than at UWE). From what I witnessed, people won't think any less of you.

Need I even mention Belgium?

[Denmark](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politics_of_Denmark) for one, to whit:

&gt; Often, this has led to the representation of many parties in parliament, and correspondingly complex/unstable government majorities. However, during the last decade the political system has been one of stable majorities and rather long government tenures.

So your assertion that Scandinavia has stable governments with PR is true up to a point.  That point being, if you ignore all political history before the current decade.

Also, see [Austria's recent problems](http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2006/nov/02/worlddispatch.austria):

&gt; Despite trying to negotiate a deal with the Schuessel party, the Social Democrats made common cause with the opposition Greens and extreme-right Freedom party to summon a parliamentary inquiry into the most controversial act of the outgoing government - the decision, by militarily neutral Austria, to make its biggest-ever military purchase: 18 Eurofighter jets, at a cost of €2bn, slated to rise over the years to €6bn.

&gt; The People's party, or ÖVP, promptly called off the coalition negotiations, accusing Mr Gusenbauer of acting in bad faith, despite the fact that opposition to the Eurofighter contracts was a central plank of the social democrats' election campaign, and that Mr Gusenbauer had repeatedly pledged to order an inquiry in an attempt to clarify the murky goings-on that accompanied the military procurement decision.

Hmm, cobbling together an unstable coalition with far right crazies and the Greens.  Yes please!

Also, [Vanuatu](http://globaledge.msu.edu/countries/vanuatu/government/):

&gt; From 1995-2004 government leadership changed frequently due to unstable coalitions within the Parliament and within the major parties.

*Ad infinitum*.

Look, there's serious problems with PR in Italy, Israel, Japan, Austria, Vanuatu, until recently in Denmark and arguably in Belgium.  These are just some of the countries I could be bothered actually looking at.  I've made my point, I feel.

The likes of Italy, Austria and Denmark are the countries, which of those that employ PR, are most like the UK culturally, economically and politically.  I'm sure you can cobble together a list of the likes of Bulgaria and Burkino Faso, very young democracies where the system of government has not been properly tested, and where PR works well.  And, you know what?  I don't care.  The countries we should be looking at are the countries most like us: and from examining those, it appears that PR does not work well at all, on the whole.

&gt; That's still an improvement over FPTP where you have the Conservatives and Labour or Republicans and Democrats for ever, and a vote for anyone else is a wasted vote.

No it isn't.  The Labour nor Conservative parties are not perpetual kingmakers in the same sense as you have in German politics.  FPTP is an improvement over the German political landscape.

Those universes are fortunately very explicit in that you can cut the head off a snake and win the war - celebrating that definite end and the hope of peace is somewhat different to celebrating the specific death of a man.

But killing bin Laden will not stop the war - there are many more snake heads around, and killing one will incentivise the others.

In this manner, they are parasitic.  I have a feeling that, like most alien races on Doctor Who, while their current interest may seem to benefit the human race, they may just be fattening up the calf before devouring it.

As for killing humans, they don't directly show anyone other than the woman in the bathroom.  However, they appear to be overly arrogant as they believe the humans can't do anything to stop them.  This is displayed by the killing of the woman, as well as the ""We don't need weapons"" and ""You should kill us on sight speeches.  They also show they are willing to manipulate people against their will/better interest.  The man at the orphanage is completely under their power, still believing it is two or more years in the past and showing signs that he is being given orders by the silence (when he opens the door while the FBI agent is in the same room).

true,[deleted],null,null,"By the by, I didn't mean to freak you out on the job front! Its the truth though, and its something you need to realize. I'm not talking about it being difficult to find a graduate level job (it is though, trust me), but even finding a simple minimum wage job will be a challenge, *especially* considering that you have a degree. You'd think that it would make you more employable for a minimum wage job, but in fact its the complete opposite : Employers will be very wary about taking on someone over qualified. First of all, they'll feel that you won't take the job seriously because you have a degree and *know* that you could be doing better, and secondly, they'll get the impression that you're using the job as a ""stop gap"" until something better comes along, and therefore could potentially leave at any time, completely unexpectedly. 

Source? I graduated last year with a degree in Computing and still haven't found a job. I'm incredibly lucky that I've worked in Tesco since I was 16 and therefore was able to bump my hours up a bit. My girlfriend, however, graduated the year before and when she first moved in with me, she had real problems finding even a simple job. Eventually she juggled two part time jobs (Barista and tour guide) and now shes gone back to Uni. 

Also, you're worried about surviving on 1K a month? I would *love* to be earning that! I currently make around £700  and I get by fine. I live in Edinburgh by the way, in quite a central location. My rent is £310 (flat is £620, split with g/f), bills amount to around £120, which leaves £170 for food and other stuff. I do alright and often have some cash left over for nights out/luxuries. 

As for meeting people, try [CitySocialising](http://london.citysocialising.com/home.html?frm=Google%20Ads&amp;gclid=CLnv_ozSyqgCFUEb4QodIBsEqg). Yes, theres a fee to pay every month, but its worth it. They set up events constantly for people of all interests, and its a great way to meet new people. I tried it in Edinburgh and it was definitely worth it! If you're not sure, I'd sign up anyway : The first month is free, and who knows, that might be enough time for you to meet some like-minded folk. 

Having rambled on a bit, I hope things have been put in perspective for you a bit and that they ultimately go well for you!

To answer the OP, if we win the rest of our matches, Spurs will have to win their other 3 matches with at least 4 goals on average (4 goals on av. if we win all our games 1-0). So one game less or more, I'd say we've got the upper hand at the moment.

true,mickey_kneecaps,null,null,"&gt; surely the Green 2nd preference votes are more likely to benefit Labour than the Liberals? 

That is the point. The Liberals (and Labor) consider the Greens extremists. When the Liberals saw that they would not win the seat, and it would come down to the final two being Labor and the Greens, the Liberals instructed their voters to preference Labor, so that the Greens had no opportunity to gain a seat. They don't like Labor, but they would rather the established enemy gain a foothold than the Greens.

The two major parties will always conspire to keep third parties (especially those which are new and outside the mainstream) from gaining a foothold. I would consider this type of preference instruction to be ""tactical voting."" 

AV is better than fptp for many purposes, but it will not eliminate the sort of political tactics which keep out third parties (and with them, fresh ideas).

true,raggisnoora,lfc50,null,"John Henry has said that the club will not spend more than it makes. So I think a starting budget of 60m is highly unrealistic, something closer to 20m I guess. We are not going to sell Poulsen for 2m, Cole will not be sold (because he has a super nice contract and nobody will match that), nobody will buy Aurelio for 2m (he's old, always injured and has I think 1 year left of his contract) and lastly Jovanovic for 4m..not going to happen (he's old, good contract, hasn't done anything in a year and Dalglish doesn't even consider playing him).

That being said I think Agger will be sold, as it is just getting ridiculous how often he's injured (even though he is my favorite player). I'm also pretty sure Liverpool wont spend more than 10m on a defender. I've got a strong feeling that Simon Kjær will be bought (he has been linked with us before and Werder Bremen are reall struggling), he fits the John Henry bill perfectly and I doubt he will be expensive.

Currently undroppable IMO: Reina, Gerrard, Suarez and Meireles. 
The team next  year will probably be really close to:

-----------------Reina--------------------------

Kelly--Skrtel/Carra--Agger/someone new--Johnson

Kuyt----Gerrard----Lucas----Meireles----Suarez

-----------------Carroll------------------------

Also 4-4-2 with someone other than Suarez on the left flank, possibly Adam Johnson?

To be more serious.  Liverpools profit for operating year 2010 was 27.1m  Of course, we owed 40m to service the debt.  Henry wiped out the debt, so thats 27.1 we would make if all things were equal for operating year 2011.  But they arent.  We doubled our major shirt sponsorship income to 25m from 12.5m.  Same goes for the warrior deal.  So thats 25m more total just from those sources alone.  Add it up and that makes 52.1m profit.  I think 60m is probably going to be closer to our net spend than 20m.  

But we'll see.  Really, i'm basing my opinion more on the noises Comolli has been making.

The rest are reasonable, but he left out Kyrgiakos (1M max again, more likely ~800k), Brad Jones (1M), Pacheco (2M maybe, don't really know his value but I don't think the club has plans for him and he'll want guarantees of first team football next season, this summer) and maybe a clearout of some of the average ressies. Poulsen @ 2M (contrary to popular belief, he actually CAN play solid football in say, the Italian league), Cole @ 4M (if he agrees a contract), Konchesky @ 1M, Jova @ 4M (Wolfsburg offered that in Jan already) and N'Gog @ 2-3M (youth/decent form he's shown he's capable of during the first part of this season) are realistic enough.

I'm also on the fence with Agger and his future at LFC, on one hand he is a quality player and starting 11 quality like you said, but he's far too injury prone to have as one of our starting CBs, and at this stage in his career I don't think his body will allow him to get past the issues.

In regards to transfers and possible starting XI, the OP left out a new LB. It might seem like we're doing okay without one but realistically, Flanagan and Robinson need more time to develop enough to be in a team challenging for the Premier League, all season. That leaves us with Johnson and Kelly (who is a natural CB) for the fullback positions. Reinforcement for either side is needed for depth, but it doesn't need to be an 'automatic starter'. For me, I'd want someone Kelly can challenge for a spot, ala Jose Enrique rather than Fabio Coentrao.

Not sure why you would start Gerrard on the RW as he's only getting older, his acceleration and pace is diminishing (esp. with injuries) and he is much better suited to a central role. He can stay in CM in a captains distributer role for the rest of his career tbh.

Along with Marveaux and a new signing I think we'll be okay on the wings, though it wouldn't hurt to have another top class winger, but that can be for the window after next. There's been a lot of noise about getting another CM/AM and I think that's a position we need to reinforce, with the departure of Aquilani and Alonso never replaced.

PSG actually did (reportedly) set a price of 20m for Sakho which I think is great, David Luiz went for around the same price and Sakho is at that level.

Amy is captured and sedated in the room with all the Silents on the ceiling (where she puts marks all over herself and tells herself she needs to get out). From that point on, she is dreaming about continuing to explore the orphanage. 

The Silents strap her into a chair for several days, sedate her, and operate on her (in my theory, putting a time lord fetus in her to incubate, but that's another matter). At one point, she seems to be stirring, so they get a nurse to check if she's waking up. The nurse lifts her eye lid, shines a flashlight across it to check her pupils, says ""No, she's just dreaming"" and lets it close again. 

Some time later, she does wake up. She doesn't realize she was dreaming, and thinks she's just arrived, but the Silents tell her she's been there for days. They also tell her she should be honoured, and she will bring the silence. The rest of the episode is not a dream.

all the pre-crime arrests that are being discussed are related to protests that may not have been the main stream view but do not appear to have any criminal element to them at all.

pre-crime arrest is the label being used due to the polices choice of charge suspicion of possible breach of the peace, or slimier BS to that.

this is not suspicion of terrorism based on herd plans to do X and intelligence that they cased X site, that would be pre-crime arrest that is fine its based some something rather than nothing.

what we have seen is political censorship pure and simple, the state didn't want any opposition herd so they made shit up

if this was a real crime than any citizen of the UK should be able to 999 and report suspected breach of the peace every time they see a hooded chav in a city center and as a real crime that they police know how to deal with we would see the chav's removed for 24-36 hours without charge.

Charles will be unpopular as a king, William will be bald and probably divorced. This is when the time to ditch the royals will be, and this is what people should aim for.

By a strictly legal definition, if the men who threw him to the ground and took away his camera were not wearing police uniforms, they would be guilty of assault and robbery. The fact that they WERE wearing police uniforms does not in any way justify that assault and robbery. And where are you getting this idea of 'pussying out' from? He used his camera to film illegal police action and got manhandled for his efforts - that's a lot braver than the other people there who watched and did fuck-all about it.

And now you agree it was an over-the-top approach to policing. Yet you still wont admit that people should NOT FUCKING STAND FOR IT. Seriously, who's the pussy here?

You don't seem to understand that the law allows for the police to do things which a private citizen would not be able to do. Sometimes this is necessary and some times it isn't. This is a common misconception regarding what the police can and cannot do.

In our system the vote's are pointless, the outcome of the election changes only the faces we see. It does very little to change the direction of the state, the electorate are wholly ignored and the promises made by the politicians are nearly always lies to gain popularity.

I want to change it. But consenting to it can not change it. Con Sent, or confidence sent, is a message to continue as is. Not a message to stop and re-evalute.

You can not get any license or pass without consenting. Literally speaking application and submission means consent, you're not telling them you want to drive or want to cross borders you're asking for permission to do those things and agreeing they can revoke that permit and compel you to obey them. That is not representative, that is authoritative.

We live in a very unique state, a constitutional monarchy, we're not a democracy per se and we're not a republic either. Parliament have the Sovereign power of the Crown and as such they can do whatever the fuck they like so long as they can sell it to the people.

Or, perhaps they can do whatever the fuck they like so long as they can keep the people in place with kettling and brute force and intimidation. Murder even.

Think of elections as popularity contests. The Sovereignty merely wants to know who's popular at the time so they can satisfy the people's whims by appointing the popular to a seat. The popular are not actually an authority, they're a servant of the Sovereignty of Parliament.

To change what we have we need to undo parliaments derivation of authority and appeal directly to the Sovereign with a simple message, ""we will oust you if you continue"".

true,doonjoot,null,null,"&gt;Section 5 of the Public Order act 1984, outlaws insulting conduct. Anyone can take offence and feel insulted over anything.

You are fundamentally mischaracterising  the law.

Firstly, insulting behaviour is not, in and of itself, criminalised. Rather, using insulting behaviour in front of someone who is likely to be distressed by that behaviour is criminalised. Furthermore, reasonable conduct is a defence against the charge.

If I were to say, for instance, ""supertwister looks fat in that jacket"", you might very well be insulted. But it wouldn't fall under the remit of section five, since it didn’t cause you distress or alarm. Furthermore, even if it did, I could quite convincingly claim that my behaviour was reasonable.

But even if I was being unreasonable, and even if it did actually cause you distress and alarm, I still wouldn't be guilty of an offence unless I knew that my behaviour was likely to distress you, or if I intended it to do so. I believe, although I'd have to look it up to be sure, that you're guilty if you intended to cause disorder as well.

It is not enough to simply say ""that man insulted me lock him up!"" 

I personally feel the act should be amended to remove this offence. I'm a great believer in there being no limits to free expression. But you don't need to misrepresent this particular law to make it look bad.

[I think we'll start like this](http://www.footballuser.com/106364/Liverpool)

CB: This will be the make or break season for Agger and the Swan Song for Carra. There's a couple more seasons before Wilson is ready to step up or Kelly moves inside. I think there will be a purchase of one Sttrong CB ( Kjaer ,Cahill, Sahko in that order) 4 fighting for 2 positions. 

Fullback: I have Johnson playing out of position in the left because Kelly will be undroppable on the right for me. Youngsters here in abundance. So bring in Baines or nobody. Yes, LB has been a problem but with Steve Clarke's defensive coaching I think it will be much less of a problem than in previous reasons.

CM: Arguably our most crowded position. And all of these players are different. The only undroppable for me is Lucas. He plays a the defensive role that no one else can and has improved every season i expect 2011-2012 to be no different. Gerrard. Captain Fantastic, if he plays he has to play a free role, not pacy enough to be the out and out AM but not disciplined enough to play DM either. He will rock worlds if he can recapture his form after a groin surgery. Otherwise give him the Totti Treatment. Impact Sub 65th minute in all the big games.
I would purchase a true playmaker to pair with Lucas, we say it every year, **ALL TOGETHER NOW**  *A playmaker in the mould of Xabi Alonso.* Someone we can structure the midfield around. Not Charlie Adam. Needs a fair bit of Pace. (Turan, Defour, Lavezzi, Sahin)
Midfield three is probably rounded out with Meireles.

Width: We need a Winger. If we get a player like Turan who plays AM and moves into wide spaces to deliver balls that's fine so we can keep Kuyt and Suarez lovetrain going. If not bring in 2 wingers so we can keep it going. Also Maybe give Glen Johnson a look at RM. ( Bojan, A.Johnson, Downing, Payet, Jarvis, ...)

FW: Suarez ""El Pistelero"" to hot to drop. Carroll will pick it up especially if the he gets to watch Denmark from his futon. This duo should be good for years and titles to come.

**TL:DR** Real Transition year, Homegrown stalwarts play bitparts while youth matures on the vine. Deep Squad that can rotate and play high tempo Liverpool groove for 90 minutes every single time out.

A few thoughts, some of which might have been mentioned by others -  

* If the Doctor really did die, meaning that this incarnation of the Doctor *is* the final version and he never regenerates again, then is this for sure the only version of the Doctor that River has previously ever known (not counting the 10th, which was in her future)? Shouldn't she know if the Doctor had never regenerated past this particular iteration within her lifetime? Some people have stated that their timelines aren't perfectly linear and she could theoretically have met other Doctors, but that doesn't seem likely given her surprise when the 10th Doctor didn't recognize her - they're linear enough that she was taken aback that she had gone that far back, and its implications (which she had feared, as she explained to Rory).

* You also summarized what I was thinking about where the next part of the story happens for them, but I guess I'm trying to understand - does the entirety of their relationship really happen for the Doctor before the events that kick of ""The Impossible Astronaut""? So it all happens for him in the 200 years since he last saw her at the end of ""Day of the Moon."" All of this would also imply that when he showed up in Utah as an 1,103-year-old, knowing he was going to his death, he knew entirely who River was and remembered their whole relationship. And therefore he was just playing along with her by even comparing diaries (he theoretically could have said - ""Yes, we've done it ALL. I'll be dying later today, and this is the last thing we'll ever do together from my perspective.""). I guess the fact that there wasn't anything in that scene that she remembered that he didn't at least rules out any clues of anything coming after for him.

* Presuming the last two points are correct, then as a side implication, whatever River actually is, she'd have to be less than 200-years old. Whatever that might mean. (I happen to think she's actually human)

* Also, one small thing - you state that the ""future"" Doctor sends a note to Rory, Amy, River and himself to witness his own death. Technically not true - he invited the first three (and Canton) and set them up to witness his death. He presumably invited and set up his previous self to arrive shortly thereafter, and not to experience that event, but to set off on whatever needed to happen from there to get to that point 200 years later (whether it's related to the Silence and/or something else). It's a minor wording nitpick, but also kind of adds a different perspective on what happened. He set in motion that chain of events, knowing that his past self would be arriving shortly after the others had witnessed his own death, and wouldn't know what had happened.

true,insllvn,null,null,"I think my biggest problem with Indiana Jones 4 is Labeouf. Honestly, I'm not sure that he is worse than short round, but I think Short Round gets a pass because he was a kid. Labeouf, on the other hand, only plays one character seemingly placed in different situations so he can react with the same bland disbelief. I'm pretty sure he delivers the same exact series of no's in every film he's done. In a series I cherish for its many lovable and memorable characters, they cast the most cookie cutter, main stream appeal, hollow, talentless cunt I have ever seen as Indy's son. 

Second up was the plot. The most cunning part of Indiana Jones is that he stumbles into these things and rises tot he occasion. He is not an unstoppable action hero. The events of the first movie would barely be different without him. Sure, he slowed them down in finding it, but the Nazi's eventually got the Ark and took it out into the desert and opened it. Then god came out and killed them all. He stumbles upon the cult of Kali while escaping some other misadventure that does not go at all as planned. In *Last Crusade*, the adventure really belongs to his father and surrounds the diary and the grail. Indy gets whisked up in events. His father sends him the diary, insists they go to get it in Berlin, and worked out the location of the grail to begin with, although Indy did find the tomb of Sir Richard and got the name of the unknown city. In *Crystal Skulls*, the most forgettable squad of communists operating on behalf of the Soviet union, although their almost Silence like quality explains how they get off driving around the United States in what appear to be fascist fetish cos-play outfits with Soviet markings, kidnap Indy so ha can take them to the mysterious warehouse, just so they could feature it it trailers and make every point and herp derp about the end of *Raiders*. Indy survives a nuclear explosion from inside a fridge, to remind us its the 50's! Nothing in that movie felt necessary or natural. What was the communist plot? I don't recall.My recollection is of a movie strung together to create cool and marketable moments. It had the feel of being filmed midway through the brainstorming phase.

Next was the villain. I can't remember who played the communist lead agent and I won't look it up because it serves my point. She is totally forgettable in a series that has delivered some of the most compelling and memorable villains in the history of film. *Raiders* gave us Belloq, Colonial Deitrich and the incomparably creepy Major Toht. Certainly the most noteworthy part of *Temple*, and perhaps the most iconic image outside of *Raiders*, was Mola Ram chanting Kali Ma and preparing to pull Indy's heart out of his chest. Finally, *Last Crusade* had the brotherhood of knights that protected the grail and turned out to be pretty chill, the traitorous beauty, Elsa Schneider, the meglomaniacal Walter Donovan and brings us face to face with Hitler himself. OK, I looked it up. Her name was Irina Spalko. Spalko. Drink that in. IMDB tells me the movies came out three years ago. I can remember Kali Ma and whole spats of dialogue with Major Toht, despite it having been years since I saw those movies. I can't even remember what Spalko sounded like. I can not imagine her voice in my head. Was her accent bad? I think it might have been, but I cannot summon up the recollection. 

Sure, rape is an exaggeration, but you don't actually seem to have a problem with comparing a bad movie to rape. Instead, you seem to think the movie wasn't bad enough to warrant being called a raping of the legacy. What would a movie have to do to deserve being compared the the act of violent forced sodomy? Hyperbole is the joke. Tell you what though, I am going to go watch the movie again and prepare a more thorough review. This tangent is based on the admittedly little I remember having seen the movie once when it was released in theaters. Maybe seeing it again will change my mind. Perhaps my negative sentiments are mostly the result of it being merely forgettable and the background noise of popular dissatisfaction. We shall see.

They are parasites that feed off the human race. They've infiltrated everything. There was the one that hangs out in the white house... probably feeding orders to advance their plans to the president and other world leaders. They've taken away humans free will and our right to decide what we as a people should do.

The silence admitted they killed for fun. That the evil amuses them. Both when they killed the aid, and when it was talking to canton.

The Doctor knows the course that human history should follow- in general. There are some changes that can be made, but as a time lord he knows when and where. As discussed in Bad Wolf, Fires of Pompii, Waters of Mars, etc. The Silence being on earth controlling things is not part of events, and the Doctor needs to maintain the timelines. The timelines are in an ever changing state of flux (Shakespeare Code, and the eighth Doctors frequent mentions of the ever changing 'web of time') Things that have happened can change, thing that will happen might not. And a large part of the point of him is how he maintains the status quo for the little people preventing being, like the silence, from controlling other peoples lives.

Why did Amy see a Silent in present day US ? Why weren't the companions killed by the Silent when trekking across the US, or in the orphanage ? Why was Amy taken ? Who is the child ? Who was cyborg lady, and what did she mean ? What is the spacesuit made by the Silent ? Does it kill the Doctor ?

The idea that being ruled is alone enough reason to hate your rulers is something that i can definitely see some strange anarchic reasoning in. But i suppose that's the Doctor's cup of tea, He doesn't care for invisible hands (mostly). So i'll let that one go. It seemed to really come down to the thin man saying he would shoot all of them on site. His misgivings towards their presence was their actual undoing.


I have some other parts that maybe i just didn't get. Please help me if i'm just missing the point (perhaps my brain has degraded past the point of enjoying anything more complicated than an episode of 2 and a half men).

Between the two episodes the doctor, the legs, miss robinson and the nose started remembering the Thin men. How did this happen? was that explained?
I could explain it as something to do with the TARDIS being extra magical this episode. Amy did almost seem to start remembering after she saw one in the bathroom. But it's glossed over in a way that made me uncomfortable about this season.
They then came up with a plan to run away from the G-man while counting the thin men they saw. This was a plan because...?
Was it only safe for them to go counting while being hunted/monitored by the feds? Why the subterfuge?
The thin men saw them in the Oval office and so knew they were working together with the g-man they were running from.
The Doctor and associates were trying to find the girl the thin men were protecting. The girl the thin men were protecting had called the president using the spacesuit they made for her. which they.. did want? didn't want?
they made her a spacesuit with that ability. they must have expected someone to get a call. Was this not intentional?
The Doctor then said that the suit's creation is the reason the thin men wanted us to go to space.
The spacesuit contained ""20 different kinds of alien tech"" including the ability to fit a small child. that really doesn't seem less complicated than making a suit for her themselves. 

Maybe i'm just missing the facts. This did seem like a thin one.

Lastly, the preview of next weeks episode made me not worry about remembering that it's on. 

Wow, negative.

The confusion seemed to be when I called the Doctor a pacifist. OK, he isn't, but I agree that I think he jumped the gun on this one. Unless the Doctor has some piece of information I'm not aware of, this goes against his own rules. He gave the Power Ranger Daleks more of a chance than he gave the Silence, and they DID threaten to destroy the universe. But, at the same time, I'm sure we've not heard the last of them, and it's entirely possible that their malevolence will be more fully realized.

I thought of one interesting development, though. How could the Saturnynes have been running from the Silence? Wouldn't they forget why they're running as soon as they started? Or does their amnesia only affect humans and Time Lords?

If what your like about the previous films is the ""swept-up-ed-ness"" of Indy in relation to the plot you can't get much better than the nuclear explosion scene. It both fits in with the way he's done things in earlier films and operates within the kind of slap-stick universe that has underlined the entire series. The middle segment with the jeep chase and the ants along with the ending sequence and that superb opening are plenty of cases of great scenes. 

Your third paragraph really points to something other than the point you tried to make, I think. A lot of people have watched Indys 1-3 many times over and as such they have come to remember the names of the bad guys and the intricacies of their plots. I would bet that most people wouldn't remember the bad guys' names after their first viewings of the first three films. 

I still have a problem with the whole rape thing. It's not that rape is above jokes or anything (though they have to be really good jokes) rather that what's being raped is kinda nonexistant. If the victim is your childhood then you have to seriously reconsider the way you consume entertainment. If the victim is Indy himself (as suggested by South Park) you can rest assured that the brains behind him pimped him out for the money. It's prostitution at best. (And, if any future employers are reading this please take it as it was written, with tongue firmly in cheek.)

Next, I'm sorry to say that your second sentence is a big fat massive blunder (and if your professor doesn't see things that way, then s/he is a nincompoop mooncalf). You write:

&gt; The Greek and Roman theatre performances were written to present an accurate depiction of their societies, as Drabble and Stringer (2007) state;

&gt;&gt; “Greek and Roman comics thought that basing their comedies on their respective societies meant that their audiences found the humour and the messages within the plays relevant to their lives”.

The thing is, what you say is very different from what that Drabble/Stringer quote says. Basing your comedy on your society to make it relatable isn't at all the same as presenting an accurate depiction of your society. ""Based upon a true story"" does not guarantee truth. 

&gt; The Greek and Roman’s applications of their significant cultures and society at the time of creating theatre can still be seen in modern comedy today, this type of humour allows audiences to immediately relate to the material.

true,flatculture,null,null,"That is a great comment about the Christmas episode.  I totally forgot about that part.

EDIT: I would like to go even further now that I have considered this point and say that I am now expecting that the fish that kept biting the doctor from the christmas episode were actually the silence taking skin cells.  It would make sense with the set up.  Consider that we had seen the fish previously in that episode, and if I remember correctly the doctor even let them sort of nibble on his finger, and it didn't seem to hurt him at all (assuming a similar nerve structure, the tip of the finger should be more sensitive than the back of the neck).  Yet, when his is supposedly bitten later in the episode it really seems to hurt/bother him.  Furthermore, he is bitten when Abigail is singing, and singing is supposed to make the fish docile, etc.  Take this with River's point that entire empires would fight for just one cell, and I think the argument for this point is fairly strong.  But, as always, arguments are not what make plots turn, and Moffat is known for throwing in the Red Herring from time to time.

(Counter-Point to this claim:  If we assume that Moffat left us clues in the previous season about the existence of the Silence, the subtly moving robbed figures in the Museum where the Pandoric is kept, the look of fear that arises on Amy's face in ""The Beast Below"" then suddenly vanishes, both for no apparent reason, then it would seem strange that we (the audience) would haven't seen in the Silence when they took the cells from the Doctor. On a side note, there may be something in this to suggest that the Silence is did not come through the cracks as has been suggested on other discussions of this.)

Second Edit:  Remember the Lyrics to the song she sings: 

*When you're alone, Silence is all you  **see** 

When you're alone, Silence is all you'll **be**

Give me your heart, come to me.

When you're here, music is all around

When you're are near, music is all around

Give me your hands, don’t make a sound.

Meet in the shadow, meet in the shadow.

Meet in the light of your bright shadow….

Meet in the shadow, meet in the shadow.

Meet in the light of your bright shadow….*

The OP listed: 

* ""Amy's pregnant and not pregnant at the same time."" (The point we're talking about, so doesn't count in this instance. Also, notice how he/she just assumed this was the case. OP is trying to use this as a proof for fluctuating realities, yet hasn't even proved this yet. So in other words, is just making stuff up.)

* ""Rory can sometimes remember being a centurion, but not always."" (He sometimes has trouble remembering over two thousand years that an alien plastic version of him in an alternative, erased Universe once lived through, doing mostly nothing but sitting and waiting. Wouldn't it be some kind of miracle for him to have perfect memory of that in the first place?)

* ""Rory thinks the ""I love you"" is focused on the doctor, but then shown its at him."" (Really? That's not even a paradox, it just a mistake. Making a mistake doesn't mean there are two Universes fluctuating with each other, it means you made a mistake. Yet this is his proof? The unstated claim here is that Amy meant the Doctor in one Universe and Rory in another. That's how OP can claim this is in any way a paradox or contradiction that supports multiple interweaving realities. So that makes this a case of circular reasoning. OP is saying there are fluctuating Universes because in one Universe Amy meant the Doctor and in another she meant Rory; and because she meant both, there have to be fluctuating Universes. In other words, she meant both, so there must be flux; yet there's flux, because that's the only way she could mean both. Logical fallacies all the way.)

* ""River was taught to fly the tardis by the best...but not the doctor."" (No, River says she was taught to fly by him, but once made a joke about it, as couples often do, saying something akin to ""You were busy that day."")

* ""I think its safe to say we've all realized at this point there are two quantum realities in flux."" No it isn't! Your ""proof"" for these ""facts"" are not being able to remember two thousand years that someone else in another Universe lived, making a mistake, and a lover's tease? This isn't proof, it's not even interesting. And it in no way means that there are multiple Universes crisscrossing to magically poof a baby in and out of Amy' uterus.

true,InfernoZeus,lfc68,,"Ooh, this is really tough. Even with the shit start to the season, there are still quite a few players who have been consistently good.

* Lucas: Need I say more? He's been a rock in the midfield throughout the entire season; first playing more defensively paired up with Gerrard, and now pushed into a slightly more advanced role along side Spearing (but still tracking back properly and making crucial tackles)

* Meireles: Has great technique and has become a much bigger player than I imagined he would be when we signed him. Really kept us going with a string of 5 goals in 6 games at the start of the year.

* Kuyt: The ever tireless work horse - I don't think I've seen him stop running this season. He's done his usual good work defensively on the right, but this season he's also started to produce more offensively, especially when linking up with Suarez, with whom he seems to share a special understanding.

* Reina: For me, he's the best keeper in the EPL. VDS might be slightly better when it comes to dealing with crosses, but no one beats Reina at shot stopping and distribution. Apart from his error against Arsenal at the start of the season, he's been amazingly consistent and has kept us in many games.

* Suarez: I think if he had been playing for us the entire year, he would definitely be my Player of the Season. He's made it so much more enjoyable to watch LFC play, the constant awareness he has and the ability to spin on a sixpence make him one of the most exciting players in the EPL.

For me, I think it's probably between Kuyt and Lucas.",0,1304506264,null,0,false,0,c1sdbj6,t3_h3nmj,t1_c1sdbj6,t3_h3nmj,1427117938,3,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,3

true,borez,cnty-england,Geordie in London,"I wouldn't be so sure, it's easy here to make snap judgements and assume that this is oil company bullying tactics, but the reality is that if they're running at a near loss and remember North Sea oil and gas is coming to an end, production is down to a quarter of what it was at its peak in the 70-80's, then I wouldn't be surprised if they ( the oil companies ) just pull out. A lot of their profit ( which is never mentioned by the media ) goes back into R&amp;D anyway. 

You also have to remember that these fields are still 40% of our domestic usage ( we import just over 60% ) If they go, your heating and fuel bills will absolutely skyrocket. 

I'm slightly worried by this to be honest, my budget is already stretched to its max as it is, our government needs to seriously sit down and ask the question: "" Are we sure we know exactly what we're doing here?"" because on the outset after the way they slammed this in with the last budget without consulting anyone in the industry, I'm not so sure that they do.

*  10 minutes for a showreel is 9 minutes 30 seconds too long.  Anyone who is looking at lots of showreels will probably close one that long down without watching more than 3 shots.  For 10 minutes it is hard enough to hold someone's concentration with an awesome short film let alone a showreel that is one of hundreds the employer might see in a day.  You want to get your best shots together, not necessarily the most arty ones, the ones that show you know how to tell a story with the camera.
*  Having a showreel that hasn't been updated in 11 months implies that you haven't been working much recently.  Even if you just recut the old stuff and reupload it, try and keep it fresh.

Cutting a showreel is incredibly hard but I recommend looking at loads of reels for successful  cinematographers in your niche.  [Phillip Bloom's](http://philipbloom.net/films/35mm-films/reel/) is awesome (I know his is quite long as well but he isn't using it to get work with.

Under Section 5? It certainly does not. A policeman only has to assume something may cause harassment, alarm or distress. Section 5 of the statute does not require a witness. The police need only say that your conduct took place within the sight or hearing of a possible victim, although it will help to prove their case if they can produce a witness. You even allude to this yourself in the second part of the sentence. Note: 'conduct likely to'.

For the benefit of people who saw the argument made by the 'No2AV - Yes2PR' group (really a No2AV argument expanded and in a different context) that Australian voters wanted to move the FPTP, and thus AV would be unhelpful in attaining PR.

Hard to disagree with an actual survey asking a thousand people, right? Well, except the survey was a choice between compulsory preferential voting (rank ALL candidates) or FPTP - **neither AV nor PR were options!** It's more likely that Australia would prefer the choices they weren't given to the ones they were.

I think you're confusing my post with the one further down saying you were offensive.  I clearly didn't make that claim in my response.

I'm curious about why you're so adamant that there is no possible way in which the pregnancy could be in flux.  As I have stated in other posts, the ambiguous nature of the ending doesn't lend itself to any one hypothesis (yours or the OP's).  So, as far as we know from what has been given to us in these first two episodes,  you making the claim that the pregnancy is definitely not in flux is just as unprovable as the OP claiming that the dual time stream is  definitely what's happening.

Frazer Hines' stories are particularly wonderful to listen to, as he does a spot-on imitation of Pat Troughton, but Louise Jameson's Tom Baker is atrocious.

From [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_Who)

&gt;The series' title theme was composed by Ron Grainer and realised by Delia Derbyshire of the BBC Radiophonic Workshop. **The programme was originally intended to appeal to a family audience.**

-

&gt;Premiering the day after the assassination of President of the United States John F. Kennedy, the *first* episode of Doctor Who was repeated with the second episode the following week. **Doctor Who has always appeared initially on the BBC's mainstream BBC One channel, *where it is regarded as a family show* **

-

&gt;The programme was ** *intended to be educational* and for family viewing** on the early Saturday evening schedule.

-

&gt;Although Doctor Who was fondly regarded during its original 1963–1989 run, it received little critical recognition at the time. **In 1975, Season 11 of the series won a Writers' Guild of Great Britain award for *Best Writing in a Children's Serial.* **

-

&gt;The series has apparently ""mystified"" viewers in Japan where it has been broadcast in a late evening time slot, **leading to some not realising *it is a family show*. **

Time Lords used to have 13 lives."" In Death of the Doctor (a 2010 The Sarah Jane Adventures serial), the Eleventh Doctor responds to a question from Clyde Langer by saying he can regenerate ""507"" times. Early news reports, before the episode was broadcast, suggested he would say there is no limit to the number of regenerations.[10] Writer Russell T Davies explained in an interview with SFX that the line was not intended to be taken seriously and is instead a commentary. He insisted that the ""thirteen lives"" rule was too deeply entrenched in the viewer consciousness for his throwaway line to affect it.[11]

It is most likely my fault.

The problem with S5 POA is the low threashold of [mens rea](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mens_rea) combined with the breadth of conduct which can be perceived as 'threatening, abusive or insulting' along with the absence that a person must be shown to be 'harassed, threatened, distressed or alarmed'.

There is no right not to be offended in English Law and the ECHR. S4a POA covers the right of folk to be protected against harassment and threats. Causing offence, or indeed 'likely to' cause offence should not constitute a criminal offence. In fact throughout British history, causing offence has been responsible for creating some of the greatest social and political change in racial, sexual and gender equality.

It's not just a problem with the police, it's also the S5 part of the statute, and I'm amazed it survived the ECHR and more recently the HRA.

For me, it was Ripley of the *Alien* movies. My world was so chaotic and terrifying that I craved a mother who loved me enough to fight monsters for me. She actually did keep me alive, no fooling.

As I said, I only got into Who a few years ago, and I never really felt a pull toward the Doctor as a father figure until the Eleventh Doctor came around. I am 38 years old, but I (still, desperately) need a father who would go to the literal end of the universe for me. I'm working through my shit in therapy, and sometimes when I feel particularly unsafe or frightened (I have monumental problems with dissociation as well as PTSD, so sometimes I feel, physically as well as emotionally, that I'm a scared little girl), I wish I had a father like the Doctor to sit by my bed and talk to me while I fall asleep. The scene of Eleven talking to little Amelia before he steps into the crack makes me weep like a lost child, because I *want* that feeling, with a wild, searing loneliness that I feel like I'll never fill up.

I've also kind of adopted River as my ""fictional mother."" I adore her. I ship her and Eleven in the same way a child might hope for his estranged parents to re-marry again.

Before The Impossible Astronaut, the last we saw of Mr. &amp; Mrs. Pond was them having a nice little honeymoon on a space cruise ship which nearly crashed on Sardicktown. At the start of The Impossible Astronaut, they're back home, not with the Doctor at all, seemingly settling into a mundane domestic lifestyle. We're missing something vitally important in between there.

It would be easy to handwave the Eyepatch Lady as a posthypnotic hallucination directed by the Silence - but to what end? Why a lady wearing an eyepatch? Why would she say ""No, I think she's still sleeping"" (or words to that effect)?

Moreover, Day of the Moon opens with Rory, Amy, and River apparently [getting killed and surviving, in secret, in body bags](/spoiler), with no ready explanation for what happened to [make the FBI want to hunt them, or why the Doctor is imprisoned](/spoiler).

We've seen [the Doctor die a final death, from which it has been heavily emphasized that he cannot return](/spoiler) - and yet we can safely say that the series is highly likely to continue past Matt Smith's departure. We've also seen a number of things which still do not make any contextual sense - [Amy's pregnancy, the Eyepatch Lady, Nixon's cheerful cooperation with a highly dangerous prisoner in an Area 51-type containment facility, the Silence's agenda, the presence of a Silence at the Doctor's death, Canton's implicit understanding of the situation in the future](/spoiler)... none of it makes any sense. So far, this series is a great big pile of mindscrew moments.

My hypothesis is that some - or possibly *all* - of what we've seen of Series 6 is a dreamlike environment, possibly a shared one, triggered by events not seen between *A Christmas Carol* and *The Impossible Astronaut*, and further complicated by events not seen between *The Impossible Astronaut* and *Day of the Moon*. The key here is specifically the ""I think she's still sleeping"" line, and the hallucinatory nature of the door's peep-hole.

A true family show such as Doctor Who is something that is quite hard to pull off because it must be interesting for all age groups. It is a credit to the writers that they have succeeded in this.

Take the UK, which sex education is fucking awful in. Of course people are doing it as soon as they can, because no-one tells them anything worthwhile about it. The UK has one of the worst rates for teen pregnancies and abortions world wide. Now, compare with The Netherlands, pretty well regarded as one of the best countries in the world for sex education. To quote wikipedia;

&gt; The curriculum focuses on values, attitudes, communication and negotiation skills, as well as biological aspects of reproduction. The media has encouraged open dialogue and the health-care system guarantees confidentiality and a non-judgmental approach.

And for that, they have one of the lowest rates of teen pregnancies and abortions in the *world*.

There's certainly nothing wrong with sex, you could even argue that provided the parents are responsible and capable, whatever age they are pregnancy is not actually a problem, but I'd certainly argue there's an awful lot of things wrong with the frankly Victorian attitude we have in the UK to it; hide it away and hope no-one notices we are actually doing it.

Now yes, that is speculation to a certain extent, but wait, I have evidence. The set for 9/10's TARDIS was left standing since the redesign went into effect. Neil Gaiman's episode was originally going to be the eleventh episode of last season, but got bumped due to budget constraints. So we can surmise that the set was maintained for the Gaiman episode.

true,GreenLaserPen,null,null,"The *resolution* is different (NTSC= 720x480, PAL = 720x576), but they're both 4:3 aspect ratios (non-square pixels).  PAL has more lines of resolution.  This might be the difference you're noticing.

But when you watch *Doctor Who* in NTSC, it's not 25fps converted down to 24.  Instead, a type of pulldown is used (similar to the 3:2 pulldown used to get 24fps material to NTSC's 29.97) in order to ""add"" 5 frames without actually adding any frames.  So you don't have the 4% speed difference that PAL viewers get when watching stuff shot at 24fps (they have to bump it up to 25fps, which makes it run 4% faster).

So you might just be seeing some of the slight image judder that comes with using a pulldown method and repeating fields and all that.  Watching it on a computer monitor at the proper 25fps (i.e. download a torrent, or get a region 2 DVD) might help.

But since *Planet of the Dead* (so for the last 3 specials, and all of series 5 and 6), the show has been filmed at 1920x1080 high def, 25fps.  So the resolution is the same at US HD (1920x1080), but the frame rate is again different.  So you have the same pulldown business going on.

Most Britons with half a brain however, would understand that America is also home to some of the greatest scientists, artists and thinkers the world has seen. America put a man on the moon, gave us Lynch and Chomsky. Americans have much to be proud of but I think that's where we get the big difference between the nations. 

I think the ideas of patriotism are vastly different. Britons tend to be a little bit more subtle with the patriotism as overt patriotism/nationalism is looked down upon somewhat to many. It still has ugly connotations with the Far-Right (a shame) and the meat-headed football ""fans"" who have caused many a national embarrassment abroad. These are generally the two types of Britons you will see waving a flag in the street, grand national occasions notwithstanding. 

I don't know whether it is genuine restraint or post-Imperialistic guilt of the British but the American pride can come across to Brits (and some other Europeans) as overdoing it. We get news reports of people showing blind faith in a flag, chanting USA rather obnoxiously in celebration of a death and it doesn't help. The almost apparent indoctrination of much of the public (from school) there seems to make people believe their nation can do no wrong. 

I have a handful of very good American friends who I am proud to call friends. I know what's behind the stereotype, but that's all it is, a stereotype. I would still say that put into a situation where there are people from all over the world and there are Americans and Brits there, they would gravitate together and not just because of the shared language.",0,1304556129,null,0,false,0,c1shs90,t3_h4a2k,t1_c1shs90,t3_h4a2k,1427120107,23,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,23

He was sarcastic, sardonic, and at times utterly heartless, and you never for a second felt unprotected or in danger with him. He just had a cool and collected demeanor that made you feel confident on the outcome regardless of the odds. This made Parting of the ways all the more tragic and awesome of a finale for me. 

Tenant is kind of crazy and undeceive. I like him a lot, and his last arc was probably some of the best writing. Some of my favorite episodes are with Tenant and coincidentally most of those are written by Moffat.

true,theraggedydoctor,pertwee,Pertwee,"My point being Smith actually went above and beyond what Tennant did. The Archanids queen was the last of her kind yet Tennant didn't show  nearly as much forgiveness as Smith did. Perhaps that was a situational thing but from what I've seen of Smith he is generally a very forgiving Doctor. As for Satan Pit I have a tendency to retcon that episode much like Love and Monsters. There is a certain level of fantasy I can take and Satan Pit pushed me past that. 

I think Smith's, almost childish Doctor, is mean to grow which may explain why he's becoming increasing more aggressive. I don't know Tennant was actually far more prone to genocide then many of the other doctors where. I mean I will admit Pertwee, T Baker, and from what I've seen of Davidson have had their fair share of alien irradication but still Eccelston, the gun ho solider, was still a rather merciful doctor. He tried so hard but things didn't work out for him Tennant was just kind of an ass. 

Locking people in prisons for eternity, trapping a little girl inside mirrors for all eternity. Tennant was more violent then I thought Smith was capable of. I mean in the Lodger is outrightly said he avoided all violence. Smith, to me at least, generally bluffs his way out of most things while Tennant was more in your face about it. 

Though I will admit Pertwee is actually my favorite. He got stuck with really long serials which sucks but as a Doctor I loved him. More then Troughton or Baker. Even more then possibly Smith. If he could escape his Companions a little more then I'd know for sure but for now Pertwee is my favorite. Eccelston was my first.

Part of the 'blame' does lie with Moffat - his episodes in earlier seasons were generally more complicated and also often a bit darker than usual. I think adults responded well to these occasional episodes, whereas they seem to be much more common in the new seasons. Thiss isn't a criticism on my part, but I can see how younger audiences might not like it as much.

I'm not sure how to swing it back the other way though - a dark , mysterious story arc is what keeps adult viewers engaged and I believe was a big part in it's recent success. This makes it hard to engage with too many lighter plotlines.

There's no real way to ever be sure it's a good time to buy. If anyone could tell you for sure which way the market was going to go, they wouldn't. They'd keep the information to themselves and get rich off of it.

So just buy what you can safely afford right now and forget about it. Even if you buy and then prices drop, so what? Unless you plan to re-sell very quickly, you'll be no worse off. 
If it makes you feel any better, you're almost guaranteed to have seen a price increase in any house over a ten year period, regardless of what might have happened in any given year. Someone buying in, say, 1991 would think he'd made a mistake in 1993, because his house would have probably fallen in value. But if he hung onto it until 2000 before selling, that house would have shot up in value, even allowing for inflation.

But even if you buy and prices rise, you're no better off. You don't make money on your house unless it's a second house, because when you sell it you have to go buy another one, which will have also increased in price. You win in the long run because eventually you'll have paid off your  mortgage.

I'd be far more concerned about interest rates than house prices.",0,1304587135,null,0,false,0,c1sjz84,t3_h4ol3,t1_c1sjz84,t3_h4ol3,1427121141,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

We still need a backup striker; Kuyt is 30 and won't last forever, and I think Ngog would be best served by pursuing opportunities elsewhere.

AV will likely collapse today in an embarrassing landslide, as people vote NO out of apathy, ignorance, misinformation or simply fear of change. And despite the fact that the NO campaign has insisted, over and over, that this is not a referendum on electoral reform, it will indeed be used to vanquish any initiative in that direction for quite some time.

I rode the standard yellow from junior kindergarten (age 4) until grade 12 (age 17).

And that on occasion if a student in the special education program had a sibling at the school they both rode the passenger van when they were in or under grade four. 

Also I have a few friends who were in French schools, and they rode passenger vans and short buses because they lived over an hour away from the school and there were maybe 6 or 8 of them tops going there from our area.

Yes, I do agree that the OP has some faulty logic/reasoning for his opinion, and he shouldn't be stating this as if it's fact.  However, it still boggles my mind how someone who watches Doctor Who can't see even the potential for something like a pregnancy in flux.  Sure, you may think it's less likely, but to claim that it's ridiculous just makes no sense.

If, prior to the finale, people had told you that the Doctor talking to Amy in Flesh and Stone was a different Doctor would that have been crazy?  How about the fact that the Doctor saved himself from the Pandorica only by already having saved himself from the Pandorica?  The show is about time travel.  ""Timey-wimey"" things happen.  Just because you don't agree doesn't mean you should get upset and pout that everyone else should just shut up and stop thinking about it unless they agree with you.  Of course, you're well within your rights to go ahead and do that.  It's just a bit childish.  Cheers.

true,nowonmai666,lfc99,null,"""Hate"" is the wrong word! I was very excited when Kuyt arrived; I thought the videos of his Eredivisie (where his goals per game ratio was insanely high) reminded me of Robbie Fowler - every shot was right in the corner, grazing the post on the way in where the keeper had no chance.

But he *did* have a spell in a forward position right after his arrival at Liverpool, and it was for long enough that he convinced me (and Rafa) that he wasn't going to score enough goals there. It's not exactly uncommon for players who score for fun in Holland to come to be unprolific in the Premier League - I'd say van Nistelrooy is an exception rather than the rule. He really did look like £10m wasted.

So I'd pretty much given up hope with Kuyt until he was switched to midfield, where he was a revelation and over the past few years, with only the possible exception of Reina, been by far the most consistent player in the side. I can't praise him highly enough - the only thing he lacks is a true winger's pace, but his intelligence, work-rate and quick reactions to any situation make him a huge asset in that position. And yet, any time Rafa moved him back into the striker's position (which he has when Torres was injured, for instance) not only didn't he look like scoring, the team was also deprived of his industry in midfield.

It's not true that Kuyt never played up front under Benitez; it wasn't really until the second half of his second season that he became a full-time midfielder, although it certainly is true that he was usually asked to play as the deeper of two strikers when employed in the central role, or sometimes on the right side of a three.

In any case, it's nice to see him flourishing at the moment, leading the line with Suarez around and behind him. I agree that it's not quite the same role he's ever had before, and I guess that if Carroll gets fully fit we won't see Kuyt in this position for much longer, so let's enjoy it while we can!",0,1304606466,null,0,false,0,c1skutj,t3_h4o6g,t1_c1skutj,t1_c1skphr,1427121554,2,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,2

Once we started this very messy and poorly executed path down the road to decentralisation of power, where do we draw the lines? 

As for the last question, it's hard to answer because you have brought it back to the point where we are ""united"" where as Scotland and Wales have their own Parliaments where English people don't have their say with slightly less power than Westminister but the English only have Westminister where the Scottish and Welsh do get a say. The idea would be that if a majority of Scottish and Welsh people wanted to use AV they could and it wouldn't effect South England / The Midlands / The North (pulled 3 possible regional parliaments out for the example).

The volunteers working there had to direct each person what sheet went where as it was so difficult to tell them apart.

I imagine that at rush hour when there is a higher ratio of voters to volunteers there could be a lot of wasted votes. I think if the ballot papers handed out were identical across the country then there might be a lot of fuss made about this. It seems a very stupid mistake to have been made.

true,doonjoot,null,null,"OK, before I type this, I just want to remind people that those two arrows next to the post do not mean ""Agree/Disagree"". The OP is asking why people might vote no. Down voting people who explain why they voted no is a little bit silly.

I believe FPTP is a terrible voting system. It fails utterly to provide small parties with the representation they deserve, and it has an alarming tendency to, in effect, hand total and unchallenged power to a single party government. I would support any change, to any system, which stood a chance of fixing these problems. 

AV fixes neither.

(Just to clarify, I don't think the Lib Dems are a small party. I'm talking about parties with five per cent of the vote or less.)

Now there is an argument that we should vote for AV anyway, because it makes it more likely we will get real PR later.

Wrong

No single party government  has any incentive to reform the electoral system. By definition, the flawed electoral system is what put their party in power. Turkeys do not vote for Christmas. Witness Blair's government backing away from their manifesto commitments after being handed a landslide in '97. Why pass a reform that will harm your own chances of retaining power?

As a result, the only election result that will ever lead to PR is a hung parliament, like the one we have right now. And as the Yes camp keep telling us, hung parliaments are actually less likely under AV.

Just as an aside, I have found level of debate and campaigning, from both sides, pathetic. No two pundits seem able to speak about the issue for more than thirty seconds without bringing the BNP into it. Ridiculous arguments about how much the new voting machines will cost are laughable. The Government spent two hundred and fifty million in the time it took me write this sentence. I've heard people say ""under AV you need fifty percent of the vote"" so many times that I can barely be bothered to point out it's not true.

I do wonder if part of the reason the debate has been so terrible is that most of the people on the yes side don't really want AV, and most of the people on the no side don't really think FPTP is defensible.

Tennant was too busy with *Hamlet* to do a full series in 2009, so they did a few specials instead to transition between Tennant and Smith.

Series 4 ends with *Journey's End*, then you've got these to watch:

1. [*The Next Doctor*](http://movies.netflix.com/WiMovie/Doctor_Who_The_Next_Doctor/70122493?trkid=2361637#height1659) is included with Series 4 on Netflix Instant now (it's listed as episode 15 - episode 1 is the 2007 Christmas special, and episode 15 is the 2008 Christmas special, while 2-14 are the actual 13 episodes of the fourth series), therefore I assume you've seen it along with Series 4.

2. [*Planet of the Dead*](http://movies.netflix.com/WiMovie/Doctor_Who_Planet_of_the_Dead/70119509?trkid=2361637) - the Easter 2009 special - isn't on Netflix Instant anymore, though you can get it on disc.  It's not terribly necessary, though, except for the ""He will knock four times"" prophecy at the end.

3. [*The Waters of Mars*](http://movies.netflix.com/WiMovie/Doctor_Who_The_Waters_of_Mars/70128730?trkid=2361637#height1515) is pretty damn important.  It was the 2009 November special (originally written as a Christmas special, but they changed their minds about that).  You definitely need to watch it.  It's still up on Instant Watch.

4. [*The End of Time* (Parts One and Two)](http://movies.netflix.com/WiMovie/Doctor_Who_The_End_of_Time_Parts_1_2/70135902?trkid=2361637) is VERY VERY VERY important.  This contains the regeneration from Tennant to Smith, and wraps up the Time War business.  You NEED to watch this one - luckily, it's still on Instant Watch.

After *The End of Time*, then you need to start Series 5, with Matt Smith!  Unfortunately, it's not on Instant Watch, though you can get it on disc.  Then there's *A Christmas Carol*, the 2010 Christmas special that takes place between Series 5 and Series 6.  And now, Series 6 has just started airing!

So that should get you all caught up, methinks.  And if you're anything like me, you've now become so hopelessly addicted that the William Hartnell serials are next on your list...",0,1304615303,null,0,false,0,c1slpf7,t3_h4w53,t1_c1slpf7,t3_h4w53,1427121955,27,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,27

true,StargazyPi,eu,European Union,"My favourite argument is that it removes the need for tactical voting.

Say A, B and C are running for government. A's and B's policies are quite similar, but C's are radically different. The two biggest parties are A and C, and it is generally difficult for a B to get elected. 

So our voter is faced with a difficult choice: He identifies most with B, but B probably won't get elected. But the voter really, really disagrees with C's policies, and so it seems safer to vote for A. So either he doesn't vote for the MP he wants, or there's a chance that a party he hates gets voted in because his vote was wasted on an unpopular candidate.

AV gets rid of all this shenannigins. You just rank everyone in order, so the voter would just vote B, A. If B gets unexpectedly high turnout, the B vote counts, but if not his vote gets transferred to A, a very similar candidate. His B/A leanings are preserved, without him having to worry about candidate popularity. 

This explains why the Conservatives are so massively against AV; they are the only major middle-right party and so their vote doesn't get split very much with FPTP. Labour and Liberal Democrat voters probably share a lot of ideals, and so the second votes would probably go to the other liberal party.

I think changing to AV would put even more people voting which hurts the democratic process even more.

&gt;How many Doctors has she known? Are we going to see Photoshopped pictures of her and Tom Baker?
We don't know. All I know is that when I was doing the first story with David Tennant and River arrived and she had her blue book, it's just filled with her past exploits with the Doctor. And I was flipping pages sort of matching his face to the faces in the book. **So presumably, she has met many Doctors.** And certainly, in that episode as well, I asked him whether we had done the Pandorica, the Byzantium. There were all these different adventures, and he didn't know what we were talking about. Well now, in the last season, two of those adventures, we've actually now been on.

&gt;I think the thing also that **Steven explained to me is that every time River sort of finds the Doctor, for whatever reason, she's never 100 percent sure which Doctor it is** she's going to be meeting. And what they have already experienced together or not. So even when I come back, every time I meet Matt, I never quite know where we are in our relationship or what we have revealed or what we know about each other.

The cheesy effects are less a problem for me than how the ""episodes"" are put together, which is always, with a handful of exceptions, as 4 half hour episodes. This is actually significantly different than watching a 2-parter of one-hour episodes because the pacing ends up suffering if you're trying to watch an entire story in one go. 

Sometimes there isn't quite enough time in a half-hour to do proper explanations so they rely on you being already familiar with the significant players in this, good lord, 50-year old show. Other times they need to pad out the episode with little asides, up to five minutes, that go absolutely nowhere, don't forward the plot, and are never mentioned again. This can happen enough that it does get seriously distracting sometimes.

One of my favorite examples of this is in The Three Doctors: The Doctor, Jo, and a professor are prisoners in an alien base, and there's like a two minute conversation as the professor tries to persuade the others to make a break for it, and a very basic back and forth ensues ""You can't!"" ""I must!"" until he decides, yeah, alright I won't. And then he goes and does it, and then theres another few minutes of him stumbling around the base, Doctor and the others elsewhere not knowing what's happening, and eventually the guy's caught and brought back exactly where he started from. ""Well, that was pointless,"" he says, and do you know, he was absolutely right.
