To me this seems more of a fair rationale in protecting their network from slowdown during peak hours - it's NOT a sneaky way of making more money from users because there is no overage charges, it seems to me to be exactly what they claim it is.

Also, Virign Media have very reasonable prices, a reliable network and their speeds are realistically close to what they advertise (within 90%, generally).

This show is embarrassing. The presenters all come across as having current-affairs savvy equivalent to one of those WW2 pilots shot down in the Burmese jungle who emerged years later thinking the war was still on. 

David Mitchell is a ridiculously incompetent interviewer. They might as well have employed a female 70's game show assistant to smile and gesticulate as Alastair Campbell gave a monologue promoting his book and his smarmy excuses for war. 

The bit that sticks in my memory from that interview is where Campbell tells Mitchell that the mortality rate of Iraqi children went down after the invasion and removal of Saddam Hussein. This, according to AC, is one of the reasons why Iraqis are better off since the US and British invasion. The response from any remotely clued up interviewer would be that in the ten years before the invasion, brutal UN sanctions driven by the US and supported by UK were the cause of high infant mortality rates. Instead, Mitchell just sits there impersonating a freshly caught cod. 

There must be someone in the UK's media who knows something about current affairs who would like to present a current affairs show.

In the US back around 1910 politicians figured out that if they demonized drug users (at that time a heroin addict went to his doctor, got a prescription for heroin and went to the drug store to pick it up. There were very few users and no crime created by them) and scared the population and promised that if elected they would make drugs illegal they could get elected. And they did.Again and again and again.

Drug laws got tougher, drug use, crime and corruption sky rocketed which meant they could run on anti drug platforms to make even tougher laws, arrest and incarcerate more people and create more crime and corruption.

They were very cynical and very successful.

The number of incarcerated drug offenders has increased twelvefold since 1980. In 2000, 22 percent of those in federal and state prisons were convicted on drug charges.

As I said previously, it would be beneficial to legalise and control drugs (better for the users and the economy as a whole):
&gt; But yeah, if we can control drug use it would be much more effective than just making them illegal. Sell things like weed in chemists, it's cheap as chips to grow in large quantities, slap a tax on it and it would still be cheaper than what people pay for it on the streets, and it would probably be safer than some of the random strands that pop up from time to time.

But the social stigma of harder drugs and the very real addictions that lead to people abusing the drug would still cause issues in the modern day society. Even back in the late 1800's, scenes in books such as Sherlock Holmes looked indifferently on the use of cocaine by the lead character, but the use of opium was seriously frowned upon and seen as an evil habbit by society at large. So on that thought, should certain drugs remain illegal? And if so, who decides which drugs?

The point I was making earlier is that whilst Portugal made drug use legal, the crimes still surrounding the drug trade were still very much present.

He launched into this speech about the NHS being a socialist third world service and how he didn't want to catch one of those superbugs and lose his hand ( being a drummer and all) and how he was going to wait till he got back to the states rather than have it seen to in a British hospital. 

I was so taken aback all I could say was: ""Oh well, enjoy your gangrene "" as I walked off. 

My point being is that his solely media informed opinion of the NHS ( which is to a certain extent fuelled by government reports ) was so off the mark compared to what this service truly is, it was laughable. 

I mean who here hasn't had a lifetime of good service from the NHS? I know I have. 

IMO and experience it's a fantastic service, is it so bad that it needs tearing apart and privatising like the government would have us believe? 

I'm thinking no, in fact I'm thinking that the conservatives actually want it off its books so it's one less thing for them to have to worry about, deal with, and be responsible for... a bit like those forests.

true,freexe,cnty-uk,London,"I do think that we are in a tricky place right now though.

The public sector has been built up to a level that isn't sustainable. Our deficits (both government and trade) are scary and there is a shortage of local workers in many private industries.

1. The government needs to cut costs because it can't afford not to. 
2. It needs to raise money because it can't afford not to. 
3. It can't afford to piss off businesses, especially the financial industry.

Now while all those points are debatable, I understand how 3 would be the most controversial. The biggest problem is that our goods trade deficit is massive, and our services (financial) surplus is good.

&gt; The surplus on trade in services was estimated at £4.6 billion in November,""

&gt; The deficit on trade in goods increased to £8.7 billion in November

[Source](http://www.statistics.gov.uk/cci/nugget.asp?ID=199)

So the financial industry provide a lot of money to this country and is very well versed on how to dodge tax and minimise costs. Trying to tax them more is going to piss them off and will not be very successful. The reason they are set up in this country is because it's a international tax haven. The term, cutting off your nose to spite your face comes to mind.

The other half of this is the goods industry. We as a nation spend far on the export markets than we sell (£8.7 billion more than the £23.6 billion we export). I find that pretty appalling. 

We need to spend less, we need to produce more and we need to keep the financial industry happy because without that £4.6 billion surplus would we be in even more trouble.

Now this situation sucks but it is the situation.  

The other side to this is there are lots of industries that have a shortage of workers. Not just in low paying jobs either (my industry has a massive shortage at the moment and is far from low paying). Hard times are a great motivator to get people to learn new skills and work hard. A good app developer can easily make £400/day at the moment, they can make their own apps and potentially make even more money. The internet makes all ideas international and can potentially help even out this deficit.

For me, it's like we are just waking up to the idea that not every one can be a manager in the government doing good. A noble cause but not everyone can do it.

&gt;Make it easier to expel violent youngsters by stripping independent appeals panels of the right to reinstate excluded pupils.

Its good that it easier to get rid of dangerous pupils yes, but I can't say I am against the idea of independent appeals, I just feel rules need to be more strict and enforced.

&gt;Grant teachers anonymity if they are accused of attacking children, until they are charged by police.

Anyone, accused of anything like that, should be anonymous until found guilty.

&gt;Make it easier to impose detentions by removing the need to give parents 24 hours' notice.

Mixed feelings, sometimes kids forget what they are in detention for. On the other hand there is the practical issue for parents, back on that again though, more parents may start to actually care at that point.

If he still wants to leave in the summer, then fine we can have multiple clubs bid on him then.

35mil is way to low imo, 50mil+ with the likes on Man City throwing crazy money. I'd be interested to see Torres's reaction if Barca/Real also bid for him then. Would he go to another Spanish club other then Athletic?

Torres hasn't been treated as poorly as Xabi was, so this is a bit of a kick in the guts hearing that he wants to leave.

Suarez is cup-tied in Europe right? Surely we wouldn't sell Torres as it would leave us with just N'gog and Kuyt to start upfront :(

Ultimately with globalisation, the multinational corporations and private banks can drive down their taxes, as all nations must compete for their trade and employment, and so must lower their taxes to attract them.

true,TerminusXL,lfc12,,"&gt;Werner and Henry learn the hard way that ""Moneyball"" doesn't work in Football and you can't nickel and dime, since players can get up and leave at almost any time. They have money to spend, but they want to be seen as taking a different approach, producing the first world class team that also isn't associated with large debt values (as they did with the Red Sox).

These two sentences contradict one another.  I feel like your second sentence conflicts with the first.  First off, the moneyball theory does not equal a nickle and diming tactic.  There's plenty of places on the internet where you can read about the theory in earnest (so go look), but never has it equaled not spending money.  It means spending your money smartly, which appeals to small market teams that can't just buy the biggest free agents willy nilly like the Yankees, and who happened to not have a lot of money to spend, so the philosophy gets that unfair label.  Reading your second sentence however, clearly you understand this philosophy can go hand in hand with spending high quantities of money.  Just look at the Red Sox, who employ the tactic, and generally have the second highest payroll in baseball next to the Yankees.  

I want the owners to employ their tactics in the transfer market and in the academies.  Their focus, as it is with the Red Sox, should be building through youth in the academies and spending money (rather small amounts or large amounts) only quality players and not necessarily flashy names and/or quick fixes who are bought for a lot,  and quickly sold for half the price at a huge monetary loss once (due to a lack of research and analysis) they do not fit with the squad.

true,LonerGothOnline,uk,I'm from the Internet.,"I'm unemployed. Living in the UK.

I look on various websites in my jobhunting.

'Previous experience needed' comes up a lot and I have none. some computer jobs that come up reference needing prior experience in some program I have never heard of.

Unfortunately my qualifications are lacking to say the least, and I studied.

At some point I lost confidence in myself at an early age, regarding future career prospects. Now I feel like I shouldn't apply for anything cause some other more apt person might miss out on the opportunity.

I could probably do with losing weight, gaining some semblance of a personality, and smiling more.

but I volunteer at a charity that helps disabled persons learn about computers, many graduates are on facebook now, and many use us as 'daycare', there are a lot of people in the programs... quite a lot.

my future is dim and uncertain, though there is a huge ass book of resources I was given recently from the job center plus office... I'm tempted to learn another language whilst I'm unemployed, and this huge ass resource book should help me with Any plans...

I would recommended just giving this kinda book out to 16 year olds, for the city they are living in. (it is called a 'match' book, as in match resources to what you want to do).

if you have qualifications, experience and training, you're fine... if you're like me, unemployed, uneducated and untrained, then there is that match book, that will help you immensely, and it references 'free' services to help you in whatever you choose to try...

In Sheffield, many 'care' jobs come up, and there are places where you can train for 'care' jobs for free... you can also volunteer for 'care' related jobs... though I think 'care' just means 'care of the elderly'.",0,1296327862,null,0,true,0,c1eomm1,t3_fbf8d,t1_c1eomm1,t3_fbf8d,1426728121,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

He complained that the English language had been corrupted by the British aristocracy, which set its own standard for proper spelling and pronunciation. Webster rejected the notion that the study of Greek and Latin must precede the study of English grammar. The appropriate standard for the American language, argued Webster, was ""the same republican principles as American civil and ecclesiastical constitutions."" This meant that the people-at-large must control the language; popular sovereignty in government must be accompanied by popular usage in language.

You can't dictate what a player wants just because you are a fan of him or the team he plays for. If he wants out, he wants out. Think for a moment from his perspective, he didn't have any Champions League last season, and as things are going he won't have it the coming season either if he stays in Anfield. For a player for his stature, it's not acceptable to say the least. I was worried that he may move out the last time we didn't qualify for the CL, but he stayed. I appreciate it. But if he thinks that its the time to move on now, then let him move. He has his own career to think about. He too wants to win trophies. Of course, things seems to be looking up for the Reds off late with King Kenny doing some good stuffs and with Suarez coming in. But with that too I guess its not realistic to say that we will win something this season or the next (though it may happen the next season, I hope). And moreover, Liverpool isn't all about Torres, I remember how heartbroken I was when Owen had to leave, but then we got Torres. Moral of the story, Torres or no Torres Liverpool will be Liverpool. So cheer up and look at the future. It seems bright (Of course I am optimistic) with the King at charge and even without Torres.

It is because they do not see the UK as relevant place to manufacture. This has been the case for nearly 30 years. In the past it was unions problems but those days are long gone. 

I guess in Germany the bankers are more linked to financing industry and they bankers believe in German manufacturing.

&gt;Perhaps if we didn't have a shortage of skilled workers, and got our spending under control they would feel happier investing in the UK.

Why didn't they invest in the UK before the crash? They had the staff and the money?

I understand your reasoning, but some topics such as History can be furthered simply by bringing up new lines of research or doing studies in your own time and publishing things to local communities or archives. Some Universities commit their students dissertations and whatnot to a local archive for other researchers to look at. In that instance, you are furthering more than just your own knowledge if you do a piece with independent research.

I'd like to believe that 'for profit' organisations always further things, but innovation and the furthering of an academic study are not at all as closely linked as they seem.

There needs to be a clear line drawn between personal property (like your house, your car, your computer etc.) and property which is simply theft (like owning the entire water system to a region, or acres and acres of land). The two are _not_ the same.

Most people want to own something for the utility of that object (i.e. I own a house such that I may live in it etc.) and therefore the vast, vast majority of people have only personal property it is only the sociopathic parasites that own entire areas and systems and use them to exploit their fellow man's basic human needs.

Being really picky, the theocracy bit is shaky. After the Glorious Revolution of 1688, when James II got the boot in favour of William &amp; Mary, Parliament really nailed down the idea that parliament alone chose the king. The 1701 Act of Settlement determines succession. Under its provisions the monarch can't even leave the country without the say-so of parliament. The people, via parliament, are thus source of sovereignty (this was also one of the big themes of the Civil War, but I'm guessing your probably know this). 
When Kings have tried to claim they rule by divine right we've tended to get rid of them. Richard II was forced to abdicate and Charles I got his head chopped off.  (The hereditary rule is even shakier. Elizabeth I, Mary I were legal bastards; Henry Tudor was essentially a usurper - nobody minded as they were the Tudor queens were the choice of parliament and Henry was de facto ruler).
The status of Jersey and Guernsey is also very hard to fathom.  The UK can't arbitrarily overrule their bailiwicks.  Wikipedia has a good legal summary of recent developments (the 2007 agreement).

""Ireland"" is not just a geographical term but is in fact the legal and actual name of ""the Republic of Ireland"" which is in its own constitution called ""Eire"" which translates into England as ""Ireland"". While there was some tension between the UK and Ireland over naming, this seems to have been resolved by the Good Friday Agreement.

Also, being from Northern Ireland I can describe myself as Irish and indeed hold an Irish passport as well as a British one.

One other thing, the ""Commonwealth"" does not just cover those countries that still have Elizabeth I as their head of state but covers a wider range of countries including many in Africa which have an elected head of state. see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonwealth_of_Nations

So you would have people complaining of spending THEIR money on super-expensive stunt casting and two, what benefit would it add?  DW does great on it's own with existing talented writers, why would you want to farm it out for wads of cash?  Also, DW is definitively British, so hiring a US writer will not go over well with UK fans, and even some US fans. 

Don't get me wrong, I like Joss, but DW is not for him.  Let him stick with his own projects.

That is far more valuable than sitting at home reflecting on what you'd like to do. We tend to think that people ""choose"" careers, like they contemplate things for a while and they suddenly say ""structural engineer.""

The degrees have (in some cases) been watered down so much it's unreal. We've had graduates come in who struggle with basic grammar, one CS student (with a first from his uni) who couldn't use a compiler, and a whole load of students come through who just seemed to think the world owed them a living.

Now it's all dried up, and the students who came through at the end of 2010 are fucked. They're much keener than the class of 2008, but their degrees are still useless. There's also a pinch going on in some sectors that means that students are now competing with more experienced people.

true,ADHDgamer,tom-baker,Tom Baker,"According to the show's terminology, when the angels are observed they become ""quantum locked"", meaning that they occupy a continuous position in space. In quantum physics there is such a thing known as the [Quantum Zeno Effect](http://goo.gl/9HzkQ), which is when ""an unstable particle, if observed continuously, will never decay"". The term is derived from Zeno's arrow paradox which states that ""since an arrow in flight is not seen to move during any single instant, it cannot possibly be moving at all"". When we say decay, we are talking about optical decay, which basically refers to an excited quantum system relaxing.

If you look at this through the eye of a sci-fi writer, there's allot of gold to work with, and so I think that with some creative adaptation, you could explain it as this:

* The angels are older than the universe or (very nearly). They are beings containing, or entirely made of unstable particles.
* Because they contain unstable particles, they enter a state where they cannot decay (cannot be anywhere than the place you see them) when observed. 
* Because they are unable to decay only when being observed, breaking them would not stop the particles from moving together again once the observer stops observing.

However since it is a fictional theory borrowing from scientific theory, you could always write in that the angel's structure is held together by some theoretical system (that can't be argued with because it's legitimacy is still being researched) that could exist. For example ""the particles that make up an angel are too unstable to be physically damaged"" or ""there is dark matter that 'glues' the subatomic pieces of the angel together.""",0,1296448179,null,0,false,0,c1eu2el,t3_fbvw0,t1_c1eu2el,t3_fbvw0,1426730677,1,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,1

Only two weeks later, on 16 March 1996, a Gambian asylum seeker, Ibrahima Sey was taken to Ilford Police Station in east London. Whilst incapacitating the man, police sprayed him with CS and held him on the ground for over 15 minutes, and he subsequently died. Although a verdict of unlawful killing was given by the jury at the end of the inquest into his death, no charges were brought against any member of the police force.

Two weeks into the CS trial and there was a killing. So your rhetoric is truthful, however, my assertion is correct. We as citizens need to know our rights, the law, aggressively pursue and prosecute such thuggery and criminality by our policemen. 

I can understand why people balk at the idea of doing this.

The University is pretty, campus-based and with decent bus/train links. Half an hour walk from the centre of campus gets you to a forest with walking tracks. Keele village is adorable and super-pretty when it snows. 

The nearest train station is Stoke-on-Trent, and a direct train to London Euston is only 1 hour 30 minutes.

Newcastle-under-Lyme has plenty of supermarkets and shops to get part-time work in. Stoke and Hanley are not that far away by bus for more shopping -- 40 minutes to the train station.

However, because of the campus-based (and being on top of a hill), you pretty much have to get the bus to go shopping (or find a friend with a car). The shop on campus abuses your wallet because it's so expensive.

There is plenty of student accommodation (cheap or otherwise) in Newcastle, but you would have to get a bus pass if you didn't live on campus. And honestly, when I was there, on-campus accommodation was shite.

The Terraphiles themselves, and Captain Cornelius were great inventions but Captain Quelch and the Bubbly Boys were so weird that I found it difficult to imagine them.

I m not saying taxing the higher earners more would solve our problems.  And taxing  the middle class a little bit more will not reduce the deficit by much.

Its logical that you have more  disposable income when you earn a higher salary, and a rate of 40% for somebody making £45k is harsh when somebody who makes £150k is taxed at the same rate.

OK, the log in is pretty easy and it remembers you so you only have to do it once, you give an email, DOB, name surname and that's it, you're on... a 2 min job. You don't even have to confirm via email. This log in can now be used anywhere for any cloud point as far as I'm aware.

So what's it like? Well compared to BT openzone that basically blocked everything and anything this is like a dream, the DNS servers are fast ( like instant pageload fast ) and as far as I can tell nothing is blocked; youtube, imgur ( unlike openzone ) porn, torrent sites, news sites, controversial sites, ISP sites, banks, payment sites you can get the lot. I even updated all my Android apps no problem in a couple of minutes. Everything I threw at it it returned the site I wanted. 

Youtube and flash were instantaneous and jitter free ( unlike my mac in the house ) so all good too. 

I mean I expected this to be completely crap, but it's pretty damn good to be honest ( although I have no idea how many people were actually using the network at the time, I spotted fifteen or so people browsing on laptops from where I was sitting... it's a big pub ) but yeah, an overall pleasant experience and if this is the future for free country wide wifi access then it's all good in my book. 

Verdict: Went in for one pint, came out after two. All good. It works, and it works damn well.

If I'm understanding it 15% earn between 30K and 44K and 1% earn over 150K. Hence any measure directed solely at those on more than 150K would have to garner 15x per individual more than taxing those on 29K to 44K.

As other have said it's probably not that easy to live at without a car as it's a campus university some way out of the local towns. I also suspect that you'll be disappointed by the local nightlife, the town you'd likely be going out into would be Hanley which has a few slightly tired clubs, the local gig venue seems to of fallen off the tour circuit which is a shame as it's a pretty nice small venue and, er, not the most attractive people in the world.

Stoke on Trent is a fairly gray and dull city with little green space or transport other than cars and buses and although I suspect that you wouldn't have much opportunity to apply your degree it *might* be an interesting case study, it's the 16th largest city in the UK (10th if you include the connected Newcastle under Lyme in the population) yet remains relatively poorly developed compared to other smaller cities such as Nottingham, Portsmouth, Newcastle upon Tyne or York. 

Having said that Stoke on Trent is surprisingly well connected by rail to London; 1:30 to 2 hours, no stops until I think Milton Keynes, and off peak tickets aren't too expensive.

Personally I would pick Bath, it's the nicest city and in one semester you shouldn't have the time to find the place/people stuffy.

Yeah I don't think we have any youth that are right wingers. Kakuta probably was the closest, not sure if he could play on the right (made his mark as a left wing). He's loaned out now.

Ashley Young would have been nice, not sure who else is available that would really be adequate for us.

Unless we took Joe back on loan? hahaha

edit: Just looked at the first team profiles. Yossi Benayoun is a right winger, but unless I'm mistaken, he's done for the year. Ramires is a central and right midfielder if I remember correctly, but I'm not sure if that extends out to the wing. We could try Sturridge there, he is pretty fast but I'm not sure how his crossing is.

What I may have failed to convey is that I ultimately want a world where sexuality is neutral in terms of its perception, where equality reigns supreme. Whilst promoting homosexuality amongst the youth may be the only way to realistically do this, you cannot deny the argument that this could confuse some kids who are straight into thinking that they might be gay when they're not, which could then become an issue for said kids.

I'm all for people fully exploring their sexuality and such, but putting it under their noses constantly may have more of a negative effect than a positive one.

You could teach about his early work, his work on Enigma and Bombe (perhaps in coordination with the holocaust), then ultimately how he was driven to suicide because of his sexuality and the government. I think it would be a fantastic example of juxtaposing modern views on homosexuality with views from a different time and a great way to show how brilliant people were put through hell for no good reason (I think Oscar Wilde could be done as well, but the kids might not relate to him as well as a war hero, especially if the war hero angle was built up first). I think it would be interesting to see how a classroom would react in a discussion on how the Nazis treated the jews and gays, and how we treated a war hero for being gay.

But I'm against the idea of putting homosexuality into education for the sake of it, just as I'm against the idea of putting any particular sexual orientation into history for the sake of it. Henry VIII may have had six wives, but for the most part these were political marriages. There are areas where perhaps the sexuality is peripherally relevant to the discussion (e.g. the Curies in physics or the Fitzgeralds in literature) but it's not really the core.

I don't mind the idea of having homosexual role models in teaching, as long as it's not just because they're homosexuals.

true,Axius,uk,United Kingdom,"I think that European healthcare quality is all rather relative. The NHS since it's inception was entirely comprehensive; every single individual in the UK regardless of income had full access to it. Whatever alternatives or fixes come up, it has to be equally as comprehensive to be remotely marketable as an improvement. That essentially makes it cost more regardless if the government funds it; coupled with what essentially is the fact that an insurance scheme is tied very heavily to income. There are options which could be involved with it too, but I am currently of the opinion that while in the future the NHS could be replaced by such a system, attempting to morph the system into an EU-alike system when we're saying that as an EU member we have one of the highest deficits just seems slightly illogical based on what the inevitable costs will end up being.

To the best of my knowledge, no other European state has gone from a socialist-based widespread healthcare system to a privatised insurance-based scheme, and it is entirely debatable as to whether or not they would have preferred a widespread NHS-alike to the insurance in the first place, but as there are market forces which have to be beaten in order to actually create such a thing, it was already unlikely to happen.

I am wondering though, as to the legality of a political party promising not to touch something or pledging not to but changing their minds when in power.
