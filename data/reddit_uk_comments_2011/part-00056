true,newbill123,null,null,"When the hotel illusion collapses back to the Holodeck, we see the ""Please do not disturb"" sign fall to the ground. It seemed to have come from the room the group had been hiding in. While it may not have been the same sign, we did see the doctor mark his room of fear with a similar (or the same) sign.

My take was that it was the young Amelia waiting in the Doctor's room. Hence, his fear was something like ""she would wait, and he would let her down."" The cloister bell ringing was telling him, he would not make it through to come to her rescue.

Disagree? Sure, then who's greatest fear was the young Amelia waiting, if not the Doctor's?

It wasn't Rory's; his lack of room was explained away earlier (and why be afraid of the young Amelia rather than the old one hitting him with her shoe?)

It wasn't Amy's room; Amy had faith in the Doctor. No one else's room was an embodiment of their faith being broken was it? Luck didn't betray Joe. The hot girls were not related to a broken CIA conspiracy. Rita's room was a father unable to be satisfied by her achievements rather than something to do with her Muslim faith. And the Gorilla was probably not an embodiment of the police girl's broken faith. If Amy saw a younger version of herself waiting on the doctor (who had not let her down to her knowledge), it would reinforce her faith that the Doctor would save her, rather than be her biggest fear.

The Doctor says a bit later, ""We need to see each other as we really are"". After that we start seeing her as the grown up Amy (able to take care of herself) again.

While I really wanted it to be something far more devious and from the Doctor's mythology, I guess I can't see this room being the embodiment of anyone else's fear.

EDIT: BZZZT 100% wrong. This room was Amy's fear. When the Minotaur backs out of the room we can clearly see they are in Room Number 7. Which is the room Amy opened around 27minutes and 02 seconds into the episode. What did you see? ""Nothing. Nothing. I don’t know.

true,hewhoknowsnot,null,null,"* I'm not sure about the fish.  When I first watched it, I thought him telling Amy to get it was a way to distract her/get her mind off the fact another person died.  And then Gibbis eating it later showed the deviousness of his mind.  People on the internet seem to think it means more though

* Not that I can remember on Rory's car

* I hadn't heard that on the TARDIS door creaking, perhaps it's used as a call back of sorts

* The object used to inspire fear isn't real - i.e. the Weeping Angels.  So if it was the Valeyard then the cloister bell wouldn't have to be ringing (but maybe that was apart of the fear mongering).  I'm not sure anyone (maybe not even Moffat) knows what the Doctor saw.  To me, I thought it was Adric since that was the last companion to die and it would inspire the Doctor to leave Amy and Rory.  But that's just a guess

* I think the ""him"" prayed on who had the most faith.  So Gibbis never really succumbed to ""him"" despite seeing his room before Amy/the Doctor because he had less faith in...whatever than Amy had in the Doctor.  Or that's how I saw it at least

It looks like the finale could be mostly/totally between River and the Doctor, though I'd bet the Ponds show up at some point.  So a novel theory involving River sounds like a good bet

Also I hear Eccleston had problems with people who ran the show and that's why he didn't come back. I think his darker angry Doctor didn't fit the tone RTD was going for- if he was going for silly adventure.

But the ninth's personality is one I prefer over ten's (I'm going to get slammed for that one). It fit better with his relationship to Rose than ten's.

This darker side is something that I loved to see. Sure the 10th and 11th Doctors have their moments, but the 9th is the one that truly was traumatized by the war. I understand Ecclestone didn't get along with those in charge and that's disappointing. We got to see glimpses of his trauma (ep. Dalek). Maybe it's just me, but I would have loved to see more of 9 being placed in a real war scenario (Parting of Ways)

I think a lot of the negativity towards him might just be because of the mystery surrounding him. By mystery I mean the fact that we just don't get to see his beginning. It's assumed that the Doctor regenerated to survive the Time War, but we never see it on screen.

Your greatest fear didn't necessarily have to be something that invoked literal fear, but the thing you dreaded most deep down in the pit of your soul.

On a quest? Well if a sort of neverending ""let's see where I end up this time"" quest. He's been on quests before. Keys of Marinus, Key to Time, both of which drove me nuts. You could take lots of classic episodes and turn them into quests.

Superior human strength. Cake. He can handle radiation, regenerates (glorified Christ symbolism), has a respiratory bypass system, and two hearts. Don't need to point out the smart thing. I'd go for Pertwee in Planet of the Spiders to point out courage. The third goes back to face his fears in that one. At some point he even says that courage isn't about not being afraid, it's about being afraid and doing something anyways.

When does the Doctor *not* risk death? Caves of Androzani. Bam. Good of society? Stopping Davros all those times. Tricking the guardians, which is saving the universe. Just quote the 11th about humans: I'll never get done saving you. OH and when he fails to save the universe, he reboots it at the expense of getting erased from time. We could also use Human Nature/Family of Blood.

Strong and responsible leader? Well his ability to walk into any situation and boss people around is easy. Look at the way he takes charge in Midnight (though that didn't go well). The way Pertwee bosses around the UNIT soldier in Spearhead from Space. Responsible? Umm...maybe shouldn't mention that one.

*11 pulls out psychic paper* I think you will find that I am a competent and responsible adult. *he looks at the fuzzy lines* Finally, a lie too big.

Performs brave deeds. Gee. Caves of Androzani again, Planet of the Spiders, End of Time, Macra Terror, Tooth and Claw, Battlefield, Power of the Daleks, jeez, nearly every DW story?

Ideals of a society. This one is interesting. You could point out that on one hand the show generally shapes the Doctor's morals to fit with our ideals in society (because it'd be hard to relate to otherwise) but at the same time, the Doctor *does* have alien ideals.

To put it bluntly, fuck that. The Doctor doesn't have a ""right"" to wield time as a weapon any more than the Daleks or Rassilon or anybody else. Even in attempting to do good with it, time always seems to bite him in the ass; whether it's by losing every companion he has ever had or through his clear inability to ever right all of the many wrongs throughout space and time. Really, nothing has ever demonstrated that more clearly than Adelaide Brook. The Doctor's actions may have altered a footnote in an Encyclopedia, but the net gain from his actions was zero; Brook dies, nuff said. This ""endless, bitter war"" of Lady Kovarian's has been a long time coming, and at this point I can't really say if it is undeserved.

true,synapseattack,null,null,"At the end of this Doctor's journey Gallifrey is some how back, and just as his life is ending he regenerates into a little boy and goes back and joins the time academy (or whatever the hell it is). At this point he is shown the raw Untempered Schism and after seeing it a second time it drives him insane. He pushes aside this kid that was behind him in line and runs screaming in terror. 

Back inside the boy that was so abruptly pushed aside was called up to the vortex. As he gazed upon it a feeling of compassion came over him. He thought about his predecessor and didn't understand why someone would feel such horror when looking at something so beautiful. He heard his instructor trying to get his attention but he paid no attention. Instead he now runs after the childlike Doctor who he has only just met. Out side he spots his quarry.  He walks over and introduces himself.

Hearing someone say his name. Not ""The Doctor"". No. That name everyone knew. This time it was a name he hadn't heard in longer than even he could remember. He was about to ask how, or maybe ""what?"", but shock came over him. Looking at the boy before him, something registered.  This couldn't happen. This wasn't right. This means that it has always been leading up to this. But he knew what he must do. 

The Doctor looked upon his new friend and told him to sit. They talk for a while. The Doctor told his new friend what he saw as best he could. But try as he might he could not give words to the horrors he set his eyes upon. All he could say was ""No one ever sees the same thing in that Untempered Schism. Of those that stare into it, some are inspired, some run away and others go mad. You can see which of those I choose. I ran away. Twice now, both of us.""

""Well only once for me.""

""Yeah... anyway let me tell you something, but I need you to listen closely.""

""What is it?""

""Just listen,"" and with that the Doctor proceeded to relax the boy and slowly break down his mental barriers. Even at a young age Time Lords have some resistances to reprogramming. But the choice was mad. He knew this moment and beyond that he knew exactly what came after this moment. But that couldn't be allowed. He pulled a watch out of his pocket. Flipping it over in his hand the Doctor recalled the last time he used this. That was a long time ago, over 300 years. Setting the watch aside he slowly reworked the memories of the past 45 minutes. Not drastically, but just enough to alter the conversation to be that they barely talked much, instead choosing to sit quietly. 

With that out of the way he decided it was time. He picked up his pocket watch and went back to where he left his TARDIS, leaving his younger self laying on the ground. It was easy to hide the TARDIS really. He kept his so small in this dimension that he could keep it just about anywhere. Going inside he started the process. Looking at his only paper he smiled. He knew what this meant. He knew that when he awoke he wouldn't know that he was on his last regeneration. He wouldn't know that the craving that was inside him was something he could control. He would only know that he hunger. Hunger for energy, regeneration energy to be specific. Picking up his psychic paper he thought at it.

As for point 1. River mentioned that during her time with the Silence it was all ""a bit of a blur"" and that could be used, though a bit throwaway as far as lines go.

Point 2. I think it's more likely that River regenerated into a little girl (not sure if it's Mels or if the girl in New York who gets put into the suit) but a  post-regen Time Lord could easily break out of that suit. It would make sense if the Silence brainwashed her, made her regenerate, and dumped her in that suit with the planted mission to kill the Doctor.

Point 3. I'm pretty sure she got a blue envelope too. Amy and Rory were 2, River 3, Canton 4, and the Doctor 1. Or something like that.

true,meanburrito920,null,null,"&gt;As for point 1. River mentioned that during her time with the Silence it was all ""a bit of a blur"" and that could be used, though a bit throwaway as far as lines go.

When did river say this?

&gt;Point 3. I'm pretty sure she got a blue envelope too. Amy and Rory were 2, River 3, Canton 4, and the Doctor 1. Or something like that.

Right, she got the envelope. But you'd expect that she would remember something about killing the doctor if it was indeed her that did it. Her reaction during those episodes suggest that she was not aware that the doctor was about to die. Furthermore, we know from the tesalacta (I'm probably butchering the spelling) that she was convicted of killing the doctor on that date. So... if it wasn't her in that suit, who could it be? A ganger version of her certainly seems plausible.

true,abw,cnty-uk,Surrey,"Ostensibly because the government would have to be seen to be discouraging the production and use of drugs.  They won't ever say ""It turns out we were wrong and drugs are okay, go right ahead"".  Instead they will say ""We were right all along and drugs are bad, m'kay, but this is the best way to fight this evil"".  In other words, they will only legalise drugs as part of an overall drug reduction policy.  

Now they might do the smart thing and say they won't prosecute anyone for personal use, but the Daily Mail and other shitrags will be screaming headlines about the government being ""soft on drugs"", with a new story every day splashed across the frontpage about how someone once took drugs, overslept, missed their train, and then the **FUCKING SKY FELL IN!!!** all because the **GOVERNMENT IS SOFT ON DRUGS!!!**.  So the politicians, to cover their own yellow bellies, will have to do something so they can claim **GOVERNMENT CRACKS DOWN ON DRUGS**.  That will be in the form of increased penalties for production and supply. 

If the government are really stupid, then that's all they'll do.  The problem will probably get worse because you'll have higher demand (more people wanted to do drugs now that there's no threat of getting caught) and less supply (fewer people willing to take the risk of growing except for the organised criminal gangs who don't give a shit about such things).  The price will go up, the quality will go down, and more money will be channelled into the criminal underworld.

If the government were smart and cared about doing the right thing instead of appeasing the tabloids then it would set up a proper, legal, licensed and taxed production and supply chain.  They'll produce it cheaply and tax it to the fucking limit so that the street price is roughly the same as it is now (remember the government can't be seen to be encouraging drug use by bringing the price down).  

Now the problem here is that if legal weed is selling for £10 a gramme then there's nothing to stop a black market selling it for £9 a gramme, and still making an insane amount of profit (£8.50 a gramme, at a guess).  So the government have to protect their legal drugs racket by discouraging the black market drugs racket.  And they do this by increasing penalties for unlicensed production and supply.

The correct thing to do would be to have legally produced and taxed government weed available at a reasonable price, while allowing production of up to X plants for personal use for those who want to grow their own.  Then increase the penalties for unlicensed commercial production or dealing to discourage the black market.  But you won't ever be able to eliminate the black market unless legal weed is cheap enough to mean it's not worth anyone's time and effort to grow/sell it on the black market.

Needless to say, the chance of any government ignoring the tabloids and doing the right thing for the people is vanishingly slim.  But I hope I'm proved wrong. ",0,1316500344,null,0,false,0,c2l6mhy,t3_kjov8,t1_c2l6mhy,t1_c2l1ffz,1427622772,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

He wasn't technically my first, I caught a couple of episodes with Tennant somewhere previously. But damn it, I loved Eccleston as the Doctor! And his nose...and his ears...and that shirt.

 The entire Doctor Who thing was a little forced and awkward when he stepped in because it was a reboot, nobody knew quite what to do or how it would go down with people. When everyone loved it, then they went wilder and braver with Tennant. If only there had been that amount of confidence in the series while Eccleston was still there, things would've been much different.

Eccleston did a brilliant Doctor - he was just a little dark and angsty and trying to get back into his normal time/space exploring routine and that was AMAZING. People keep forgetting that the Doctor of that period was a war-battered wreck, possibly suffering from some sort of Time Lord PTSD, but was keeping it all under the surface, only ocassionally to pop out. That's why his grins looked forced sometimes and that's why his heart didn't seem into frolicking with Rose. It's not something to hold AGAINST Eccleston - he should be praised for the performance. 

Yes, Tennant is hot (apparently) and Smith is very, VERY cute and brilliant, but neither of them had to bring this to their performance to the extent that Eccleston had.

I can NOT stress enough what a *physical* relief it was to hear Smith's absentminded murmurs and soft, lateral 'L's when he says 'please' and to see the moments where he pauses uncertainly. Now, I know that Tennant's over-the-top shouting and jumping and running and the 'never-stay-still' thing was the PRECISE reason why many adore him - that's cool.

Council leader Tony Ball said it had to make tough decisions for the good of the whole borough! 

I also don't see any objections to the Billericay Council's planning decision to demolish a 400-year-old listed barn on a 10 acre farm site in order to build 70 homes (and trouser 5.5 million).

The idea that this is just all about the lofty principles of planning law is completely ludicrous.

&gt;A historic barn was demolished this year so that up to 70 houses could be built on green belt land once owned by Billericay school. Basildon council recently passed plans to build more than 500 new homes on the site of an old pool in Gloucester Park, a recreation ground in the town.

From what I have seen uni students really need to have this experience so they can actually learn how to function as a productive team member. I can't recall a single intern, fresh from uni, over the past 4-5 years who was capable from the onset when compared to someone who had at least 6 months experience in an office environment.

But that's fine. Because we can train them up, they develop skills that are of actual use, then they can apply what they do know once they have a strong foundation. We're not out to exploit people, but this is a business, we're not taking on people who are capable of fulfilling any set role. We're taking on people who have very little, or sometimes highly misplaced, confidence in their work. 

If you come work here you'll learn how to manage your time, complete assignments to a professional standard, and become a fully functioning team member. If you can do that within 3 months you will be offered employment as we want skilled and enthusiastic workers. If you are not to that standard we will thank you for your time and search for someone else.

I spend a lot of my time training and guiding the interns and I would LOVE to see some good ROI with my time. You're not trapped here and I recommend that you do pursue full time employment where possible.

The whole ""Interns are exploited"" is ridiculous but I can imagine that those unused to hard work would feel that way. I did my first internship at 17 and that gave me the skills to gain full time employment immediately. No one wants to hire someone who can only run not walk and crawl.

There is a tendency in Hollywood to take brilliant foreign films and remake them in English, often in a 'tamer' version, with anything too controversial or edgy taken away - and removing any subtitles, of course.  This kind of thing can tar a nation with the brush of parochialism - it leads to a negative stereotype that some Americans can be afraid of appreciating the works of other cultures until they've repackaged it in a familiar frame.  A mindset that has the ideal of, ""Oh, I love that British show XXX, it'd be so great if it was in American!"".

Doubtless the stereotype is somewhat unfair, as I think *every* nation is culpable of this to a certain extent - we all like our share of familar, easy going fare.  It doesn't mean we can't step outside that comfort zone.

Personally, I love foreign films (I prefer the directness of that title to 'World Cinema', which sounds as marketing-sickly as calling a comic a Graphic Novel).  You get to really listen to the beautiful sounds of languages you might normally only hear in hurried snatches, you get to see the world and it's chaps for the price of a cinema ticket, and I'm a fast reader so it's all good!  

Homogonised remakes are, on the whole, a bad thing that strips all that uniqueness and diversity from the original, and it is quite possibly a backlash to this sort of thing that you see when you suggest an American Doctor.

There are number of particularly good paths, particularly along the west coast (from Swansea/Pembrokeshire), and along the border between England and Wales (Offa's Dyke - check out the history behind this on wiki).  Also, there are hundreds on public footpaths across Wales pretty much anywhere - I believe they are all visible on Ordnance Survey Maps (someone correct me if I'm wrong).

Here are a few links you might find interesting:

http://walking.visitwales.com/

http://www.walking-routes.co.uk/

http://www.nationaltrail.co.uk/

As for locations, Pembrokeshire and Snowdonia are probably the most beautiful stretches of hiking in Wales.  Also, something many people are not aware of, the isle of Anglesey has the highest concentration of prehistoric (Stonehenge-type if you will) monuments in Europe.  It's a small area to walk about, free sites to visit and almost no tourists around.  I particularly recommend Bryn Celli Ddu, Din Lligwy and Barclodiad y Gawres.

There are a reasonable amount of accomodation places, which you can find out about online quite a bit, but don't expect anything fancy of course.  In some regions, you might have to content with just a cabin with no amenities which is free for anyone to stay in.  B&amp;Bs can be right expensive.  I think the first link I sent you should help you determine accommodation stuff.

Should you be worried about time/accomodation, you always take a bus from the south to the north - so for example you can spend some time in Pembrokeshire, then go to Carmarthen and grab the bus going to Aberystwyth, and from there go up to Caernarfon.

If a couple is staying in a loveless marriage 'for the kids' with a little extra money, then I would say that it's likely the psychological negatives far outweigh the financial benefits.

Also, if we make a distinction between couples based on: man &amp; woman = family with kids so extra money, man&amp;man or woman&amp;woman = family with no kids so no money - What about the male/female couples who will be unable to have kids? Infertile couples shouldn't get the extra cash either. But that means you have to give people fertility tests to see if they get a tax break or not.

Surely it's simpler to give a tax break to people with children? Another issue with a marriage tax break is that it's somewhat discriminatory against people who can't afford to get married, or have a 'normal' marriage ceremony like those with a bit of cash behind them can do (but I say this as someone who, should be ever choose to get married, would never fork out anything like the thousands on a wedding like every day).",0,1316513138,null,0,false,0,c2l7d50,t3_kkdw3,t1_c2l7d50,t1_c2l028w,1427623187,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

I got out of that rut because I managed to get on a training course (9-5 5 days a week) which get me in the right mindset, going from not working to fulltime is a bit of a shock to the system.

I do understand the point you're making.  But as with any tax, the money raised from National Insurance (which is arguably just an accounting distinction that is used to make us think we pay less Income Tax) is spread around to many different people.  
  
Saying something like 'I paid into National Insurance so the money I'm taking out of it is mine anyway' is a massive oversimplification, especially when you consider that you'll (hopefully) live long enough to take out even more in State Pension eventually.  You have to accept that, somewhere along the line, at least some portion of the money you are receiving has come from other people.  
  
I think the situation you note, with people who haven't yet worked enough (because they were improving themselves at university) and are therefore ineligible for benefits, actually supports the point I'm making about the current system being suboptimal.  If the government had a guaranteed job/training scheme in place, which bent over backwards to help them prepare for interviews and supported them when they got one, your friends wouldn't have to worry about making ends meet.  Also they wouldn't have their taxes going to people who simply choose to stay on benefits.

The idea of ranking people is flawed because it can't be done in a universal way. Everyone's got their own idea of who's 'better' than who. So, considering that, everyone's on a level playing field, there's no such thing as a 'better' person, just people with different skills, talents and flaws. Even that is a subjective idea. You see? The only arguable way that someone is 'better' than someone else is when things are brought down to moral conduct. And even that's subjective. Everyone with a view on morality have supporters and opponents. So it's all opinion. And since the truth is not based on the democracy of opinions, there's no such thing as a 'better' human being.

They accept no profit (maybe even running at a loss?) for the start in order to get big profits at the end.

If you keep moving that does not work, but they have no way of knowing who will keep moving and who wont.  So right now you can get better than market rate deals because they assume you will end up paying more.

If you force everyone to move, they will know everyone will move.  So the better than market rate deals will disappear.

For me, it is best to be the only person who moves, surrounded by a huge number of people who never move, no matter how high the prices were.  If that were the situation they would pay me to take their gas/electric etc because they know once people are signed up, they wont move.

Local councils, and people afflicted with squatters on their property would welcome a change in the law that would finally enable the police to act to remove people from property they do not own.

true,widgetas,null,null,"&gt; but is there a human right to marry?

Not as such: My point was rather it is a human right to be treated equally with regards to race, sex, sexuality and religion. But as it is wrong to discriminate on those factors, I don't see that not allowing marriage based on one of them can be legal or allowable.

As I said before, I'm coming at this from an equality point of view rather than a tax break point of view. Personally I'm not sure where I stand on the tax as I don't know enough about it, but I'm not sure I approve of tax breaks for a couple that signed a particular piece of paper.

&gt; What about for polygamists?

Good question and something well worth looking at. There are surely groups of people who live together and raise families. As such I don't see that they should not be allowed to enter into some sort of marriage contract. Of course I don't know the nuances of why polygamy should or should not be allowed - other peoples' input would be welcome. However, when it comes down to a one-one marriage, there's no reason not to extend the definition if we (most of us) are agreed that a man loving a man or a woman loving a woman is the same, in essence, as a woman loving a man (and vice versa).

&gt; Will people who previously rejected homosexuality now accept it because marriage is now allowed?

No, but (to blunt) as I put it to a relative who was worried that children would be bullied at school if they had gay adoptive parents: ""Those bullies are fuckwits. We shouldn't cater to the fuckwits."" In general the younger generations are far more accepting of homosexuality than older people because they have been brought up to understand that homosexuality is entirely normal/acceptable. I draw parallels with younger people in the 1970's/80's growing up with race equality lessons etc. In the 1970's no doubt a white child would have been bullied at school for having black adoptive parents. Such bullying would be rare now,  because we didn't cater for the fuckwits! I doubt many people wouldn't agree that it was a good thing to promote racial equality.

&gt; Is it even right for government to legislate social standing?

In some cases, yes. Back in the day, mixed marriage was illegal, *I think* - need to check that. It might have been a long time ago, but that's not the issue. Black people were of lower social standing even so recent as the last 50 years. Consider the signs in B&amp;Bs: ""No blacks, no gods, no Irish"" etc. Race equality legislation: bosh - now practically no-one is openly racist due to racism being illegal, socially unacceptable and as such very rare in younger generations. People aren't being stopped from being racist, but they cannot manifest that racism.

I'm not implying you're homophobic in any way, just commenting on your worries:

&gt; this feels more to me like people pressing an agenda 

This was said of feminism back in the day when women's rights were being pressed.

true,Geofferic,essex,"Bloody Barkingside, Wot!","I think it is a situation where the Travelers and Gypsies have had such a hard time for so very long that they are constantly behaving as if people are attacking them, even when nobody has.

You admit that there may be good ones, but I suggest that most are as good as anyone else.  I have heard nothing but negative comments about people that were raised on council estates, but my wife was raised in a council estate and there's nothing negative or violent about her.  You yourself were raised on one, yet you seem plenty articulate and reasonable to me.

Do you know that they do not speak English at home?  They have an entirely different language, and a different language plus being social outcasts far longer than there have been council estates leads to a different way of seeing the world, a way that sees the world as dangerous and unkind.

It is my belief, and I have much experience and evidence (although, as you say, a different sort of experience from you) that there is a place for Travelers and Gypsies in English, British and European society and it isn't one of complete assimilation.  I believe that if designated areas were setup for them and some means for taxing them to pay for these areas, you could control this problem of overtaking waste lands.  You must understand how difficult it is to tell someone who doesn't have the same view of private property as most Westerners that it is ok for a few rich people to buy up land and turn it into an exclusive golf course, but it is not ok for some poor people to temporarily use land that is not of any value to any one else.  I know that at times they stupidly use valuable land, and that is wrong, but I think that better communication and planning can stop that.

Now, I am not suggesting in any way that the burden should rest on the non-Traveler/Gypsie communities.  Rather, I am saying that at the end of the day it makes no damned difference who made the first concession or who came halfway first or who stuck out their hand in friendship first.  What actually matters are results.  I believe that gypsie/taveler children are vastly under-educated because the education system has little or no preparation for their lifestyle (not because it cannot be done, mind you - Jews have been 'wander' longer than these folks have existed, and education is a priority among Jews and always has been) and their is not a strong ethic of education among the people.  I think this can be changed.  I see no reason why educated, middle class travelers/gypsies cannot exist and thrive.  It is a matter of making it happen, not if it can happen.

And I am confident that if a few concessions are made, if inroads into good education of their youth are made, then you will have an end to the conflict and strife and an interesting, new era in England/Britain/Europe will begin.",0,1316524557,null,0,false,0,c2l80yt,t3_kkksu,t1_c2l80yt,t1_c2l7xwe,1427623506,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

The doctors room is the entirety of the episode after you see him put the ""do not disturb"" bit up. He knows that the only way to defeat the minotaur is to lose faith, so he breaks his faith in himself, shedding off his delusion that his companions will be OK.

Even with the ""7"" on the door, it can be discounted as being ""in the doctors room"".

The other clue to that is when the episode ends, rory and amy are standing further back than they should have if they were in the same positions in room 7 - ie, they weren't actually there.

This is the reason why a lot of landlords seem like assholes They've had their personal property shit up and destroyed so many times by inconsiderate dickheads who think that as they're living there they can treat the property however they like. Eventually they just stop caring about treating their tenants well and expect them all to be as bad as the last lot of dicks they let live in their house. This of course creates a vicious circle / self fulfilling prophecy where the tenants see the landlord treating them badly so treat the property badly in return.

The best way to make sure your landlord treats you good and gives you a bit of leeway on things is to just generally treat them nicely and invite them to the odd BBQ in their own garden. It goes a massive long way to show that you're taking good care of the property to voluntarily invite the landlord over for dinner.

One of these fish (there were two!) was Jim.  Jim is a symbiotic/parasitic type creature who, when eaten, can partially take over the host body.

I never connected the two incidents, but I'll buy the theory for now.)  Jim wanted to get into Gibbis's body because Gibbis was a city planner, and could help him build a dam, or whatever else he needs to build. (For the River?  Or the Pond?)

I would say in this series, particularly the later episodes, the kidnapping of her child, the revelation that Mels is her kid, and then finding out she has to leave her; all these developments were handled the same way. We get one scene of her reaction, and then she's the same character for the rest of her appearances. You'd think River might have been mentioned in TGWW, that she might also be angry at the Doctor because she never got to see her daughter again, but no. 

As for Rory, i think the development of his character organically leads to him being more than a sidekick. If he stays as a bumbling and occasionally heroic tag-along, his character hits a dead end, as we've seen him like that from the start. The writing concerning his character has definitely been more progressive as he's taking on a more equal role to the Doctor. Dunno why making Rory more complex and letting him mature into a stronger role would hurt, it's something we haven't seen on the show before, and it makes sense. Being around the Doctor would mature and develop any character, we've seen that in Martha and Rose. Rory can show us where a masculine character would go in the same position.

I see what you did there...

I think the fan base is going to have to come to terms with the fact that this Silence/River/Doctor's Death arc is going to spill over into the next season. I'm almost certain the Silence will be mentioned, but I doubt the aliens we have dubbed The Silence will take a major role in this finale... Shame really.

I want all the answers now as much as the next whovian, but if Moffat pulls an RTD Miracle Day style finale, I'd feel cheated.

I do have a small theory about what will transpire between the Doctor and The Silence, whether this season or next. In The Impossible Astronaut, The Doctor calls upon the world to instigate the genocide of The Silence. In 1969. In 2011, Amy sees a Silence on the hill above the picnic, yet only looks confused as opposed to murderous... At some point, does the Doctor see what he has become, and go back to give the Silence the chance to leave, as he would have before he became Eleven? 

This theory can be proved or disproved with the ""wibbly wobbly"" rule, so it doesn't mean much. But I don't see how Moffat could fit something better into this finale along with Kovarian, River, Twin Doctors, and Past-Tense Rory... And because we know that the finale involves River and most likely Kovarian, we're likely to lose out on any Silence.

TL;DR Probably no ghastly Silence aliens in the finale :(

In the same way that plenty of people will buy illicit cigarettes off some dodgy bloke in the pub if the price is right.

So I totally agree that the convenience of legal weed will make it harder for the black market to exist, but it will just be a question of price adjustment.  You can still make shitloads of money growing a plant and selling the dried flowers for £5 a gram.  If the government sets the price at £10 then there will be plenty of takers.

true,insllvn,null,null,"The following assumes you are up to date with the episodes that have aired. I have seen up to The God Complex, but I don't believe I have made reference to anything past Let's Kill Hitler. Still, my assessment of thematic elements plays a role in what I have written and The God Complex plays into my analysis heavily. I have not read any spoilers for this series, however, I do make a detailed prediction about a plot twist I expect to see in the finale. If my turning out to be right now will ruin it for you then, stop reading here. You have been warned. 

I've been stuck on how cool a villain the Silents (hereafter this spelling shall indicate a discussion of the memorably forgettable race as opposed to the adherents of the religion) versus how easily and, indeed, monstrously they were defeated. Going straight to genocide isn't very much like the Doctor is it? I suppose an argument could be made that all the pieces were in place, but needn't be set in motion if the Silents surrendered to the Doctor in the knock-off  TARDIS. So, I've been thinking what I would do if I were a species that ruled a slave species exclusively via post-hypnotic suggestion. The Silents have been present since the wheel and the fire, the second component of which the Doctor also played a role. While they may not necessarily have been present during the events of the very first serial, I don't think it is a stretch to say they have been aware of the Doctor for a very long time. This plan to build a TARDIS and do something with Amy and her child so something something something was not slapped together haphazardly. In fact, we have already seen the endgame, but we do not yet know why. 

As Madam Kovarian, who we will come back to, has so elegantly demonstrated, if you want to beat the Doctor, you have to let him think he's won. I propose that the Silents would be fools beyond measure to have no backup plan. How do you insure the fruition of your plans in your absence if no one remembers you? Memetic inception. A religion is a meme repeated until it has a life of its own. That is how one illiterate carpenters son from Nazareth rose to prominence as the central figure of the Roman Catholic Church, a global religion. The messenger does not matter nearly so much as the message. So, if you wanted to make sure that some people were still doing as you instructed without being there directly, you would need to start a religion. I suspect that after a lifetime of post hypnotic suggestion, a person could be made to believe, with every ounce of their being, in anything at all. Then the meme and the message become self-propagating until you have a space church that removes their heads to show utter devotion. Except then they can't see, never mind think, only obey. They cannot kill anyone on sight, if you catch my meaning. 

From Let's Kill Hitler:

The Doctor: What is the Silence? Why is it called that? What does it mean?

The TESELECTA: The Silence is not a species. It is a religious order, or movement. Their core belief is that silence will fall when the question is asked.

The Silence is not a species, except the Silents were a species. Wait. Why did you say that? The Silence are also, presumably, not a whole host of other things? Why, specifically, not a species? Nothing in the Doctor's question suggests that they are a species. He doesn't ask ""Why are they called the Silents?"" or ""Who are the Silents?"" By his own reasoning in Day of the Moon, the Doctor and his companions have long forgotten the Silents. The Silence is Madam Kovarian's movement, but who are the founders? 

So a major theme this series has been the ontological paradox. Amy names River Melody after her friend Mels who is River. The Doctor is killed right after summoning himself and his friends to go fight the fight that kills him. He only starts the fight in the past because he knows of the future he is walking towards on the beach, do you follow me? 

The Silents only have access to the tech that humanity builds on their directions. This is why the baby, not born until the future, is supported in a modified Space Suit, except they also have a TARDIS thing and all the tech inside the suit needed to keep alive the child that isn't born yet. Since we know the Silents to have a role in the creation of the Time Lord child that lives in the Space Suit we can know them to be in league with Kovarian. This makes the pronouncement that the Silence is a religious order, not a species, quite problematic since the two are certainly working in conjunction. 

Thus, I give to you my assessment of the final twist: The Silence, Madam Kovarian's religious order, is a memetic weapon fashioned by the Silents to revenge themselves on the Doctor for a fight the Doctor started only after the memetic weapon had reached fruition, produced River Song and killed the Doctor on the beach. The Doctor started this war because he was a casualty of the war before it began; the ontological paradox that he has used to get himself out of more than a few jams lately has come back to bite the Doctor in the backside.

But I don't think it's folly to claim the 10th is darker, I think it's a matter of opinion. There are many other times the 10th is dark as well, it's just more subtle. For example in Tooth and Claw, a ton of people die, they kill a werewolf, the Queen knights then banishes them, and the Doctor and Rose skip off back to the TARDIS laughing, while the Queen consoles a widow, and founds an institution (Torchwood) to defend against the Doctor.

It's that kind of subtlety woven throughout that makes Tennant the brightest and darkest to me. He laughs and makes jokes, and skips along through war and death and chaos, never looking back because he can't. Smiling because it's even harder when he's not. It's not as upfront and raw as the current Smith, but that's because Moffat is setting us up for the Doctor as a bad guy arc.

Having a meddler, wizard archetype traveling with a white knight clever enough to keep up could definitely work, we've seen how good the beginnings of that type of relationship have been. 

And your point on Amy's non-reaction being down to faith in the Doctor; yeah, that makes sense. But is it interesting, does it give an audience a resolution? It distances the viewer from the character, because she's not behaving in a way you can relate to.

I've never done it myself, but [this website](http://www.go4awalk.com/ask/wildcamping3.php) mentioned the same issue, and seemed to suggest that while it's technically against the law on private property, if you're sensible about it and do it away from houses, stay for a short period and don't leave rubbish behind, it sounds like it would be fine.

[This website](http://www.ukcampsite.co.uk/sites/county.asp?region=wales) also suggests that there are hundreds of proper holiday parks/camping grounds, so maybe you won't need to worry too much about finding a spot with unclear legality.

In Pembrokeshire, Tenby and St. Davids (and its cathedral) are lovely, and have lovely stretches of hike along the coast.  In Snowdonia, I recommend Harlech Castle and Caernarfon Castle - both in towns, but once I a while I assume you'll need to buy food!  Conwy also has a very nice castle as well as a medieval walled town, with the smallest house in the country (Europe? can't remember).  Also, if you go on Anglesey, you can take the obligatory picture of the longest town name in Europe - Llanfairpwllgwyngyllgogerychwyrndrobwllllantisiliogogogoch :)

But that doesn't make him any less a warrior. Of course the man is going to walk away smiling when he's saved countless more lives than were lost. Again, this isn't a matter of how dark Tennant's Doctor was specifically, but instead a matter of the darkness that has always been a part of the Doctor.

Smith's Doctor, though, goes beyond the normal routine. He breaks his own rules (something Tennant's Doctor never did), he goes out for revenge, and he doesn't just fight to help those he cares about -- he declares war. These aren't attributes we've seen in any previous Doctor. If you can think of any other subtleties about Tennant's Doctor that I'm missing, please elucidate them to me. But from what I've observed, the subtleties in his Doctor don't even begin to outweigh the outright darkness that Smith exhibits.

If we're going to talk about never looking back, then I feel it's only fair to mention his consistent bleakness about Rose. Tennant's Doctor just wouldn't stop lamenting her.

You're entirely correct: he went through companions very quickly. But it all felt to me like he was trying to make up for the fact that he lost Rose. It was almost as if he thought he could trick himself into believing he was okay. He didn't stop because stopping would force him to make an honest critique of himself and the circumstances he puts people in. And I'll reiterate: Smith's Doctor was the one who was strong enough and dark enough to do that. I find honesty and sincerity to be much harder than running and lying.

Tennant's Doctor had some very dark bits -- I'm not going to disagree with you there. But, as I keep saying, I feel like those bits aren't specific to his Doctor but instead the Doctor as a character. He doesn't break out of that generality aside from Family of Blood.

The causes of negative attitudes towards travellers are long-standing and go back at least as far as Henry VIII (if you count then in with Gypsies, as popular culture does). Their behaviour towards settled culture is part of a complex history between us and reducing it to ruining land and being a drain on resources is grossly simplistic, and I am trying hard not to Godwin the conversation. If we are to focus simply on your objections then I could say that I don't like all car owners because of the massive damage that they have imposed on the English countryside and cities, and the taxes that I pay to sustain them. But I try not to do that because car owners act like filthy scum for a large number of complex reasons, and shit, it turns out that some of them are surprisingly decent when you get to know them.

The [official chelsea website](http://www.chelseafc.com/page/TeamHistory/0,,10268~1800325,00.html) actually would be a very good resource on the team history, plus it's broken down into decades for easy reading. [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Chelsea_F.C.) is another good jumping off point.

A key moment in recent history (in my opinion becos I'm too young to rmb the 70s) was the appointment of Glenn Hoddle as player-manager in '93, making Chelsea a force in cup competitions as well as an attractive team to join for foreign stars. Hoddle started promoting the European style of play by bringing in players like Ruud Gullit. Gullit later became manager and continued this football renaissance by bringing in skillful, creative players like Vialli, Di Matteo, Poyet and of course Zola. (Chelsea was already playing 'sexy football' while Arsene Wenger was eating sushi in Japan.)

What I do remember, and the internet can't teach you, was that Chelsea was a FRUSTRATING team to watch. They would win against teams like Man Utd and Real Madrid, but then two days later would be beaten by a bottom table team or a semi-amateur team from a little village in Norway.

After that mess ended though, his ""soul"" (for lack of a better term) needed to come to grips with what he had done, with who he had become, and with what he might eventually become, so he regened to 10. 10 always reminded me of a recovering alcoholic.

The Sixth Doctor stops all of this and even thwarts the Valeyard when he tries to kill the High Council.  Leading to the Sixth being offered the presidency but declining in order to run, but when he leaves you see the Valeyard is still alive."")

That above is the story basically, the reasons why the Valeyard does what he does is: [spoiler](/s ""The Valeyard was actually working with the High Council to conceal some bad stuff they did from the Doctor - this is all in the story-involved chaos stuff but it's tough to summarize a season while giving details.  In reward for doing this the Valeyard was to be granted all of the Doctor's remaining regenerations by the High Council thus making the Valeyards existence concrete since his existence was still in flux.  I don't really understand the last part and I don't truly believe anyone does, thus the Valeyard could still exist/come into being.

I agree with a lot of people that the 10th was trying to atone for his past, follow the rules, etc. But in those last few episodes, starting with The Waters of Mars, he starts to fall again. He loses his rules, and for me it's where he almost starts to become ""drunk"" with power. In The Waters of Mars, he breaks a fixed point in time, just because he can. I don't know the quote of the top of my head, but he talks about how he can do and save whatever he wants, how he is a timelord (the last timelord) and basically builds himself up to being a God. I think this is especially interesting considering 11 doesn't really have the same rules. He does kind of do whatever he wants, and continues this slow build up of ""being a god"" I think the key to this series and the key to the 11th doctor himself is that he break out of this rise. Because the power will make him what he despises... Even if he uses it for good. That's why his death is such a sobering and good idea for him to have. It's finally showing him that he isn't a god.

It's very accurate, historically and in tiny details, and it handles situations realistically. Valkyrie in the US was utter crap. I can't imagine Der Untergang being dubbed in English.

Also I can't believe people would say ""It'd be so great if it was in American!"". What does that even mean? *In* American? This will sound really stupid, but it took me a couple months to realize Doctor Who was British. I mean I knew the people had British accents and the show was made in Britain, etc. but I never really made that obvious connection between British actors = British show. Or maybe it's because I never thought of tv as ""British"" or ""American"" or ""German"". It was just tv in ____.

What I've learned though about talking about American Doctors and such, is that, if I say that nothing would change but the accent, people jump to the conclusion (and they weren't rude about it) that I am calling for an Americanization of the show- and that's something that I wouldn't call for. In fact I never saw the point of making an American/British version of an American/British show other than to air it in said country, until I became more aware of the cultural differences in tv.

Other people have already mentioned it, but she was dressed like a model rather than a spy for half the episode, and her acting seemed a bit off. And she was always pushing her hair out of her face. Completely the opposite of everything that made Ros good, really.

- Callum. I hated him. That's more personal opinion, however, because other people seemed to like him.

However, I'm sooooo happy to have it back and cannot wait for the final 5 hours. Like Sanjsanj already mentioned, it reminds me of how much better Spooks can be than any other modern 'spy' show (24) when it wants to be.

Incidentally - A friend of mine was(is?) friends with Vincent Tabak and his girlfriend. Before Tabak pleaded guilty to manslaughter, friend told me that the press were full of lies about him and his girlfriend. I hadn't been following the story but apparently there were numerous reports concerning his girlfriend leaving him, things he'd done in the past etc. It was all bollocks, I was told and she hadn't left him but was sticking by him. I'm not sure about now, of course, but considering the Ian Jeffries saga which you also mention, you'd think they'd have learnt. I remember the day Tabak was arrested - the papers (online) and also telly went all out speculating again and they didn't even officially know who had been arrested at the time.

I find it increasingly hard to excuse the media's behaviour.

true,buildmonkey,eu,Fake Yorkshireman,"Point taken on the racism word. I think we can leave that one now.

&gt;The culture is insular and hostile to outsiders and my dealings with travelers have done nothing but re-enforce the impression that by and large they act like parasites.

Dead right this is a cultural problem. But my overall take is that it hard to judge individuals from a culture with which we have had such a long and damaging relationship by their current behaviour. Obviously individuals are responsible for their actions but it is also necessary to bear in mind where they are starting from. I cannot speak for them but I think it would be fair to describe our cultures as at best estranged. Given the relative masses of the cultures I would also guess that it is theirs that has taken by far the most damage and had to adapt most to survive. My model is that it has reached a point of self-fulfilment. We say “You can’t stay here you lazy, thieving gypos”; they say “Fuck you” and do whatever they feel they need to survive as a rejected culture; we say “Well look at that, a bunch of lazy, thieving gypos!” And so it goes.

Internally their culture may or may not be ticking along fine. I don’t know. With regard to us it is all bent out of shape and that is not the fault of the individual traveller. The ancestors of our culture did most of that bending. To be quite clear, neither you or I should feel guilty about that, but we should bear it in mind. We are judging from a privileged position of being the ‘normal’ (big scare quotes) ones and I feel angry at our shortsightedness.

(I know this bit is going to sound like a David Cameron soundbite generator at first but never mind). I remember a black friend years ago trying to get me to see his theory that West Indian culture had been so badly damaged by slavery that it was often acting against its own best interests and that it would take generations yet to recover. I was talking to a white friend in British Columbia a few weeks ago about the First Nations and was surprised at the contempt bordering on racism just beneath the surface. It seemed to mirror a discomfort other right-on people showed talking about them. It was almost as if people were embarrassed that they had survived to remind us of our ancestors’ murder attempt. The problem she expressed was that First Nations people (all of them, obviously, based on anecdotal evidence about some of them) were abusing fishing rights that they had been granted over and above those of other Canadians and were apparently making shedloads of dodgy cash. My gut reaction was that I would probably do the same if a culture had spent a few hundred years trying to obliterate mine and then, in a fit of guilt, patronised me by giving me additional rights to what I used to own. I would say “screw them” and take them for whatever I could get. When people talked about the drugs and alcohol amongst the First Nations it seemed odd that they wanted to blame people for being from a damaged and deeply fucked-over culture.

Then I come home and the UK is all a-flutter about Dale Farm. Travellers have spent a long time trying to keep their culture alive by hanging together and keeping us out. This may not have been an optimal solution but it has sort of worked and it is what they have learned. Their culture is still here despite us.

true,strolls,null,null,"I think charging the consumer for credit checks is disgusting, but the entire lettings industry does it, so you don't get much choice. I paid c £75 nearly 10 years ago.

I doubt they're making money on the cost of the credit check - yes, phone credit card companies can do it a lot cheaper, but they're checking a much larger volume of people. Banks and so on probably pay a large annual fee for a direct line into the credit-checking databases (and probably make hundreds or thousands of checks per day), lettings agencies probably pay per check, probably less than 500 or 1000 checks per year.

In many ways, having them run separate checks (and having 4 people on the lease) is to your advantage. If the other couple splits up, and one or both of them end up screwing you on the rent, then the separation works to your advantage, because you're not liable for the other parties' rent. You may say ""but we're best friends - we'd never do that to each other"", but unfortunately relationships are often stretched by living together.

If you have the credit check run only in your name, the agency will want only your name on the lease. This adds more complexity should you wish to move out (and the other couple, or your partner, wishes to stay) and it also makes you liable if the other couple (or your bf) screws you over.

I used to do some work for a lettings agency, and the boss there told me that they usually hear requests like yours when the husband / wife / partner / flatmate / whatever has a shitty credit history. So the agency is just as at risk of getting screwed over in these circumstances - the one person who's named on the lease is supposed to be liable, but it turns out they're just as bad as their bf and the couple does a runner when they get behind on the rent. Asking them to ignore the credit history of your flatmates does wave a little bit of a red-flag to the lettings agency. 

You might try talking to the agency and explaining the circumstances, and how you can afford the flat but you think it's silly to pay for the extra credit checks, and that you want it only in your name. If the person you're taking to isn't cooperative, ask if you could speak to the boss. They probably have leeway, if you *look and sound* ok. You could try offering a larger deposit or to pay 2 months in advance, or something.",0,1316559759,null,0,false,0,c2lcyx9,t3_klfj1,t1_c2lcyx9,t3_klfj1,1427625828,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

The theory is mostly based on the fact that Mels said ""penny in the air"" twice in LKH when something major was about to unfold. It draws attention to a moment in time when multiple outcomes are possible.
We've something like this before - [Series 4 spoiler](/s ""when Donna ""turned left"" and created an alternate universe where the Doctor was dead then had to sacrifice herself to set things right."") Now imagine that we had been alternating between timelines all season, though mostly focusing on the option where the Doctor dies to throw us off. It doesn't explain the apple since I'm pretty sure there was only one universe back in TIA, but it does explain why the Doctor solved the Rubik's cube in TGC but not in NT - these were two different universes. I'm guessing that NT belongs with the Doctor living, and TGC with the Doctor dying, since he hinted that he knew about his death in that episode. This would also explain the lack of discussion about Melody - events may have different in each universe up to that point. She still hasn't been saved yet.

I think the ""coin flip"" is whatever happened when River ended up at Amy's house and the TARDIS exploded and all that in TPO/TBB.

Through his interactions with the master and the return of gallifrey he's reminded why things have to be the way they are and he realises that alone he's as much of a danger and as arrogant as any other timelord, the best example is the timelord victorius. In his eleventh regeneration he's accepted that and time and time again he's put amy into known danger just so he won't be alone. Something he's now coming to accept as wrong.

I can think of a few other examples of the doctors personality and emotional health that evolve with each generation but they were the most prominent that came to mind. The way I see it is that the regeneration helps the Timelords deal with ghosts from the past and move on each time without becoming crazy, something that helps with a species as long-lived as them.

Basically, there are no restrictions to the College network as far as I can tell (some colleges, however, do restrict bandwidth and data). I've been here for 4 years now and any connection problems have come from the ISPs supplying outside properties, not college itself. Connection quality varies a lot according to your accommodation, but all houses should have wired connections and most wireless too. The computing office are amazing helpful and will actually come out and fix things relatively quickly if there is a problem, and even actually give you a computer to finish your dissertation if things go belly up at the wrong time. 

There is a University-wide wireless network you will get access to, but in town people tend to use Starbucks for free wifi in my experience.

true,TX1138,pertwee,Pertwee,"The fact that this issue repeatedly comes up proves that there may have been some merit to RTD's explanatory sledgehammer that he employed during his era. Moffat has provided a more than adequate explanation for this issue, but it somehow seems to have gone almost completely unnoticed. Here's why Amy, Rory, the Doctor and River have no further interest in saving the baby:

After Let's Kill Hitler, it was made obvious that River/Mels was woven into Amy/Rory's timeline a great deal more than the Doctor had anticipated when he went searching for her in the first place.
Before the whole 'Mels' debacle, there was a whole portion of River/Melody's early life that was uncharted. There was no way River was going to tell them what happened to her, but there was always hope that post-orphanage River was found by the Doctor and brought back to her parents.

However, once they discovered that post-orphanage River had gone straight to her parents in Leadworth and integrated herself into their timeline, there was nothing further they could do; at this point in time she was now a fully-grown adult with her own personality and memories and would no-doubt oppose any changes to her past, no matter how well-intentioned they may be.

To add to the ever-growing list of problems, it seems that Mels had played a critical part in bringing Rory and Amy together. Removing Mels from their lives by saving the post-orphanage baby would likely result in Mels never having been born in the first place. As shown in TGWW, the Doctor is very much unable to maintain the intricacies of these types of paradoxes, even with the TARDIS.

Finally, there's the element that always seem to be overlooked in this matter; the fact that the Doctor loves River Song. Of all the people in the universe, he is the one who would be most against rewriting her timeline, as he no doubt recalls how strongly she reacted when the Doctor suggested rewriting their timelines in Forest of the Dead. Saving Melody would rewrite not only her timeline, but also his. All those future moments with River would never happen; an entire time-bending relationship rewritten in the blink of an eye.

All in all, everyone has an overt interest in not saving the baby; including River/Melody herself. That being said, with the themes that are currently being raised, and certain spoilers for the finale involving [spoiler](/s ""aborted timelines""), it seems likely that these interests will all be challenged at some point in the future.

If there's one thing that Moffat needs to work on, it's making the explanations to complex issues as clear as possible.

Either way I think all the doctors are on both sides of the spectrum being both extremely good with also being capable of being extremely evil. He has to make the choice and he's obviously not trusting himself to do that anymore, thus he needs human companions. A good example of the 10th Doctor's darkness is in the very first episode with Donna, I forgot the title, but he kills the alien and it's children, during that part I think he definitely loses touch with his humanity, his expression is showing absolutely no remorse and is filled with malice, only when Donna tells him stop does he remember his humanity.

In the episode ""Last of the Time Lords"", the immortal time traveller Captain Jack Harkness expresses concern about how he might look if he lives ""for a million years"", because although he can't die, he is still aging, albeit slowly. He tells the Doctor and Martha Jones that it's a matter of vanity, because he ""used to be a poster boy when [he] was a kid in the Boeshane Peninsula"", as ""the first one ever to be signed up for the Time Agency,"" earning him the name ""the Face of Boe"". This astonishes Martha and the skeptical Doctor.


Writer Russell T Davies, in the episode's commentary, called the implication of this scene ""a theory"" as to the Face of Boe's origins, prompting Executive Producer Julie Gardner to urge him to ""stop back-pedaling"" about the two characters being the same. Davies also said that after writing the scene he inserted a line in the ADR recording for ""Gridlock"" in which the Face of Boe calls the Doctor ""old friend"". However, Davies doesn't like making the relationship explicit, stating ""the moment it became very true or very false, the joke dies"".

&gt; It was widely reported in media and on fan discussion boards that the character played by Claire Bloom would be the Doctor's mother. Ultimately, the woman's identity was left a mystery. A variety of speculation emerged. Some people supposed it to be the Doctor's mother, others believed it to be an alternative world's Donna based on the way the Doctor looked at her after Wilf asked who the woman was, or, by the same logic, Susan, who is the Doctor's own granddaughter. IMdb originally reported the character as being the Doctor's former companion, Romana. This was taken down shortly after it was posted. Julie Gardner in the episode commentary, stated that she would like to believe that this woman is the Doctor's mother, however Davies then stated to the podcast listeners ""It is whomever you want it to be"".

&gt; Similarly, the identity of the other dissenting Time Lord is also left a mystery. The character is mentioned as male by Russell T Davies, but the costuming and camera angles make it difficult to determine gender.

I guess it has to do with the point in the regeneration event. 11 was shot during the initial glow-out stage, pre-change. 10's hand was cut off just after he'd woken up from a rather long time-vortex-energy-purging-nap-and-cuppa, post-change. River was shot post-change too.

Somewhat inconsistent is the fact that 10's cuts and bruises regenerated shortly after he suffered his lethal dose of radiation, but perhaps that was to do with him putting off the transformation as long as was safe.

To be honest, he's been gone for so long that it'll be difficult to tell (and unfair to judge) what his form will be like until he's played a few games. If all goes well, hopefully it'll be like he was never gone :D

If he DOES return in form, then he could definitely be a potential game changer. Goals + assists = points on the ladder. Also, I think it'll be good for Carra to get back into a VC position; he was having a tough old time while Stevie was gone.",0,1316581493,null,0,false,0,c2lfmxa,t3_kmf85,t1_c2lfmxa,t3_kmf85,1427627159,10,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,10

I have hairy toes too when I don't shave them, but we'll just keep that to ourselves, okay? No, underground housing is not normal or average where I'm from, I adore underground living but I am not rich. In fact, it was only through a weird quirk of financing that we were able to afford the house. Banks here in the US set the value of a home by comparing it to similar properties in the same locale. There are very few underground houses in Oklahoma, so our house was compared to the five or so they could find across the state, and the lower price of land per acre brought down the price of our house to practically the cost of empty land in our area of the city. Seriously. 5 acres undeveloped sold recently for $125K and we purchased our house, on 5 acres with a 1200 square foot barn for $145K.  We did not build the house ourselves, but there is an awesome story about how we acquired it. 

It all starts thirty years ago. When I was in high school in 1981 I read an article in our state newspaper about a retired couple who were building an underground house. I fell instantly in love. The concept was fabulous. I began reading all I could about this type of architecture. I drew plans, studied, dreamed, etc. etc. Followed Michael Reynolds' work with his Earthships designs with great interest. About four years ago my husband and I were driving our oldest son to his preschool at the nature center down the road and we saw this house nestled back behind some woods. My husband pointed out the house, and we stared at it and wished it were for sale. Eighteen months later it did go up for sale. We feared we couldn't afford it, but looked up the realtor's info anyway. Luckily, we found that we could afford it, and we made an offer. Offer was accepted and all the inspections turned out favorable. We closed less than six weeks later. I got to meet the woman who built the house at closing. She was adorable. She is 92 now and her husband (whose dream house this was) passed away a few years ago. She was no longer able to live alone in her house. She was very grateful that we found each other because everyone else who looked at the house wanted to give her far less money just for the land and bulldoze the house. At closing she handed me a folder containing their pre-construction paperwork. Included was the original bill of sale ($10 in 1907, btw) for the land, site planning, sun map, architectural drawings, and a copy of the newspaper article I read when I was thirteen years old in high school. Yes, the house I purchased at 42 was the house that I fell in love with 29 years previously from an article in the newspaper. I LITERALLY live in my dream house. Not a lot of people can say that so yeah, I am vibrantly aware of just how awesome this is! :) Thanks for asking!

true,Slotosky,null,null,"Start with ""The Pyramids of Mars."" It's rather serious, and show cases the ""four part formula"" well, and features Four/Sarah Jane. It's sort of a Hammer Horror type show, as that's what the series did at that point...

For moving on from there, here's a basic overview of all of the show's eras...

* **The William Hartnell era** - The beginnings of the series. I'm not a big fan of this era, as it's very sloooooow, and The Doctor is kind of an old fart/asshole, but there are some stories I really like. Unfortunately, they're all silly, so I'll recommend you ""The Aztecs,"" if you want to see one of his episodes, as it's a Historical, very popular, and not that silly.
* **The Patrick Troughton era** - Patrick Troughton is basically Matt Smith, but in the '60s and cooler. He's all silly/bumbly, but then WHOA, he successfully destroys the villains. His era is mostly lost due to tape junkings, but, what can you do? His episodes also suffer from '60s slowness, but I love the Seccnd Doctor and Jamie. My personal favorite is ""The Mind Robber,"" but it might be a bit silly for your tastes, as it has things like Gulliver from *Gulliver's Travels*, and a very cheezy comic book superhero. I'll recommend ""The Invasion."" It's a bit overlong and missing two episodes, but rather serious and very good. It also features the Brigader, who is a BAMF!
* **The Jon Pertwee era** - The Pertwee era really falls into two parts, Season 7, and the rest of it. Season 7 can be a little cheezy, but is an attempt to show realistic scientific earthbound situations. Afterwards, the era gets a bit more comic book with the introduction of the Master. My recommendations - All of Season 7 is good. ""Spearhead from Space"" starts slowly, but is very cinematic (filmed on film) and is a good intro to 3, ""The Silurians"" has the premise ripped off by ""The Hungry Earth/Cold Blood"" and uses it much better, ""The Ambassadors of Death"" is very unrelated, and features a lot of political intrigue and action, and ""Inferno"" starts a little slow but picks up when the Doctor ends up in an alternate universe where his buddies are EVIL! After Season 7, you can see the introduction of the Master in ""Terror of the Autons,"" which is a bit silly (people are strangled by a plastic chair), and the introduction of the Sontarans and Sarah Jane in ""The Time Warrior,"" which is very nice. Also worthwhile is ""Day of the Daleks,"" which features Daleks in a rather unusual plot involving a nice time paradox.
* **The Tom Baker era, part one** - Robert Holmes and Philip Hincliffe present Doctor Who, a rip off of gothic horror films.. well, not from the beginning, and it's a bit better than it sounds. Season 12 is sort of a transitional period between Pertwee and Big Tommy B that features a lot of classic stuff. The Daleks return in the seminal ""Genesis of the Daleks,"" which is actually part of a season long story arc (okay, it's more stories linked together) revolving mostly along a space station orbiting around Earth. It's rather nice as an entire season, as Harry Sullivan, the male companion, is rather redundant, but super likeable and awesome, and all of the stories are good, though ""Robot"" is silly, and ""Revenge of the Cybermen,"" actually isn't good (it sucks.)
After that, the show gets more horrory/darker, and the best of the stories include ""The Pyramids of Mars,"" ""The Terror of the Zygons,"" ""The Seeds of Doom,"" ""The Masque of Mandragora,"" and ""The Robots of Death.""
It culminates in the very awesome, though slightly racist ""The Talons of Weng-Chiang,"" and then was cut in favor of...
* **The Tom Baker era, part two** - Oh dear. The new producer was told to bring in humor. Ericpid won't like this very much... Douglas Adams, the author of the dreadedly silly *The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy* even script edits and writes. How dare he! Course, if you want to see what you think, ""The Ribos Operation"" opens the season long Key to Time arc and is quite nice, and ""The City of Death"" is absolutely charming.
* **The Tom Baker era, part three** - This is Season Eighteen, the beginning of the reign of JNT... The budget goes up, and the stories become more serious, sometimes to the point of having all of the fun sucked up to them, thanks to script editor Chris Bidmead. Basically, this season has an arc about entropy, which will (as you eventually will learn) destroy the universe if some mathematicians stop mumbling formulas. My favorites are the slightly campy ""Full Circle,"" which introduces Adric, a companion hated because his character is poorly developed and badly acted, the stylishly directed (and possibly confusing) ""Warrior's Gate,"" and the somewhat nonsensical ""The Keeper of Traken,"" which you might not like, ericpid.
* **Peter Davison** - From this point on, the series begins fluctuating in quality at an alarming rate for the rest of the decade. Peter is a good Doctor, though his companions tend to crowd him out a bit. His shows fall into three categories: Sawardian Depressing things - stories in which characters die over and over and the Doctor is sad, Awesome 'high concept' episodes - stories where there can be eternal gods racing boats in space, time paradoxes involving an old friend, a personification of evil, and other sorts of coolness. I like these. And, the other ones - these just kinda suck (""King's Demons"")
The best Sawardian one is ""Earthshock,"" which you should try to go into without knowing anything about it.
The best 'High concepts' include ""Castrovalva"" (bad first half, but it greatly improves), ""Kinda,"" ""Snakedance,"" ""Mawdryn Undead,"" and ""Enlightenment""
And, the best other one is ""The Five Doctors,"" which is silly, but also an excellent 25th anniversary special.
""Resurrection of the Daleks"" is needlessly depressing and makes no sense. Avoid it.
* **Colin Baker** - Colin got one season of mostly Sawardian stories, and then a bizarre trial season, and then he was fired. Poor guy. His Doctor is rather unlikeable, and his costume is unbearably ugly. It's probably best that you explore other eras before his.
My personal favorite is ""Vengance on Varos,"" a nice take on the concept of televised executions.
I am also quite fond of ""Attack of the Cybermen"" (guilty pleasure, it's badly plotted, obsessed with continuity, and lacks a moral compass, but works on a visceral level), ""The Two Doctors"" (rather overlong and a bit of a wasted opportunity, but it's the last apperance of TWO AND JAMIE!), and ""Revelation of the Daleks"" (a very strange dark comedy, probably not to your tastes, ericpid.)
* ** Pantomime Bullshit** - Avoid Season 24. Don't question me, just do it.
* **Sylvester McCoy** - The budget is dead. The music is shite. Some of the scripts are a little lacking, but the series gets itself back on course and is headed in a really, really interesting direction... Then it's cancelled. The McCoy stories I can see you possibly enjoying are ""Remembrance of the Daleks,"" ""The Curse of Fenric,"" and ""Survival.""
""The Greatest Show in the Galaxy"" is set in a circus and a bit strange, but it really works, even if it contains the worst rap ever.
""The Happiness Patrol"" is a personal favorite of mine, but too naff for you, ericpid.
Finally, ""Ghost Light,"" which comes in between ""The Curse of Fenric"" and ""Survival"" is very postmodern, consisting of a bunch of narrative threads, but some of them might seem a bit silly to you, ericpid, like the one where an anti-evolution preacher turns into a monkey. (haha)
There's also the Brigader's last apperence in ""Battlefield,"" a mediocre serial, but hurrah for the Brig!

There isn't enough stuff to do as there is in London but still quite a bit to do, we're right by the seaside, Northumberland is a 20 minute drive away and Durham is 15 minutes on the train. 

Newcastle has a very large student population for it's size and both Uni's have lots of societies and large unions.

London is huge, a genuinely international city. There is always something happening, thing to do, whatever your interests. Travel is easy due to the Tube (Metro) and it has great transportation links to the rest of the country. However, some people dp find it too big to live in and it will be by far the most expensive of the three. 

Newcastle is a distinctive town which can be great fun to live in- there's decent enough nightlife and the town itself is pretty good, but there's high unemployment in the area and once the novelty of the place wore off I found it a bit depressing after a while. It isd a long way from the rest of the country if you wanted to see more of England (though closer to Scotland). Certainly the cheapest out of the three. Also worth pointing out that I know many foreigners who just didn't understand the accent.

Leeds is a good compromise between the two in a sense... More expensive than Newcastle but cheaper than London. Again, plenty to do and is famous for some quite boutique shops; the nightlife is fun and varied and it is close enough to places like Sheffield and Manchester to go out there also. Having said that, I never fell in love with Leeds innthe way I did some other towns, but a lot of people on here will tell you that it is excellent.

First, she's making sure all the things that must happen to her younger self occur correctly and in order, so that any paradox is avoided. She's making sure her personal history goes to plan.

Second, by taking the steps needed to keep her history intact, River would appear, to an outside observer, to absolutely hate the Doctor. Who better for the Silence to work with than someone who appears prepared to go to any extreme, kidnapping a pregnant woman and later a child, turning said child into a living weapon against the Doctor, striking at the Doctor through his friends, and so on, in the war against the last Time Lord. Who better to bring into the fight, than one who seems to hate your enemy even more than you do?

But River is actually using her history to fool the Silence into letting her into the top echelon of their organization, so that when the Doctor finally goes head-to-head with them, he'll have a hidden ally on the inside. She's the Doctor's fifth column in the enemy camp.

She's also convincing the Silence that the Doctor's weak point is his friends, where, in truth, his companions are all strong, tough people who are more than ready to do what they need to to support him. The Silence will assume that, separated from the Doctor, Amy and Rory are no problem to deal with. They'll be shocked when the Girl Who Waited and the Last Centurion start to hand the Silence their asses.

Firstly congrats on getting in! And welcome!

I've spent 5 years at Emma so far (4 for undergrad and masters, 1 for start of my PhD) - probably too long but I like it there.

Anyway, I only know one or two people who've had real problems with the internet in all my time at Cambridge. And they were torrenting every night. (The bandwidth restrictions kicked in when they downloaded too much in a month - but they spoke to college, and college just upgraded the contract in their property.) From what you say you want to do, the system will be able to handle this easily.

Anyway, hope to see you around when you arrive (or some point in the year - I'm back and forth from the Large Hadron Collider in Geneva). It's a nice community at Emma, and the computing people are lovely.

Then again, he's had a lot of injuries in his career, so at this age you wonder if each new injury will be the one that does for him. The player he's most frequently compared to is Frank Lampard, who at 33 is now starting to show signs of being past his prime. Gerrard's been out a long time so it will take a few games to really see, but if we're still talking about him getting back to full fitness in November, that's time to worry. But give him 3 or 4 games before even thinking about judging his recovery.

Then again, plenty of attacking players are able to reinvent themselves playing in a deeper role, thereby prolonging their ability to make a top-level contribution. John Barnes became a solid deep-sitting playmaker after his legs were too shot for wing play. Interestingly, because Gerrard is likely to return at the expense of Adam, and because of the differences between Rafa and Kenny's formation, Gerrard is likely to be asked to make such a transition anyway! Previously he has lacked positional discipline in a central midfield role, but he's older and wiser and I'm confident he ca do it.

In any case I grew up in the 80's knowing it as ""firework night"". 

But I could be wrong. It'd be clearer if it were reported in the Daily Fail, then we'd know it was shite.

&gt; Veronica Ward, Southwark's cabinet member for culture, leisure and sport, said: “There is absolutely no truth in the claim that we want to rename Guy Fawkes Night.
“The facts of the matter are that we are currently consulting with local people to see if they want a traditional fireworks display in the south of the borough. No decisions have been taken yet.”

true,borez,cnty-england,Geordie in London,"&gt;why do we need banks to create and lend money when the government could do it. 

Well that's kinda the whole point of QE, the government lends to the banks and the banks supposedly lend to us. Thing is though the banks aren't lending, they're just squirrelling the money away and ( I believe )  syphoning it over to their financial gambling sections, still trying to make vast profits. 

Basically no lessons have been learned here, it's business as usual. 

I'm alright Jack keep your hands off my stack.


 The current system is an insane culture of greed and Cronyism. For example I was reading the other day in the US that S&amp;P have re-rated the toxic US sub-prime mortgage securities business [as AAA.](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-08-31/subprime-mortgage-bonds-getting-aaa-rating-s-p-denies-to-u-s-treasuries.html) Again!

Now forgive me if I'm wrong, but wasn't the knock-on effect of this the main reason that the banks got in the shit in the first place... and they've just given them the go ahead to do it all again. 

Greed is surely blinding these people, but it'll prove to be their downfall. 

Trouble is though it'll take the rest of us with it.

With respect, I disagree.  Kids who don't give a fuck enough to care about pulling and using a knife in a public place will not think any more of pulling and using a gun.  Furthermore, knowing that they're more likely to encounter armed members of the public will only increase the likelihood of them carrying guns in the first place.

I agree that at it stands, criminals have the upper hand because they're likely to carry knives or possibly guns whereas the law abiding citizens don't.  However, I don't think that escalating the arms race is the right way to go.

And in my personal experience, by and large buses in London are much safer than 15 years ago. Personally if that money was there I'd put it into having fast response transport police who can get to the buses/trains quickly, as well as ensuring good CCTV coverage with human oversight. As well as paving the streets with gold ...

Secondly, if you stand up and attempt to physically challenge someone who is approaching you aggressively they are much more likely to attack you. Basic animal dominance. If he had three mates and they were all huge and well armed, then maybe, but by himself, no. By conceding physical dominance he did the right thing for minimising risk, it just doesn't always work.

The problem particularly with these is that they have been spread as investments amongst so many otherwise fine businesses that they will be in trouble as they will not be worth a penny. The corrupt credit agencies are as responsible as anyone for enabling the selling of blackbin bag lucky dip debt at AAA ratings. According to Wiki the CDS market is valued at over 62 trillion, more than the combined worlds GDP, and they are all in effect worthless. 

It was also the perpetual credit binge always had to stop eventually and that is what had maintained increases in growth for the past 30 years as at the same time we were losing industries and should have been suffering then. Instead we all have massive debts. 

QE creates massive inflationary pressures, which is effectively a tax. We could always do QE and put it in a trust fund for charities, small businesses etc to apply for rather than giving it to the criminal banks. QE is better than private banks doing it - do you know how banks create credit out of pledges to repay - effectively legalised counterfeiting?

true,dahud,eccleston,Eccleston,"I think if Nine had gotten a longer run, we'd use ""The End of the World"" as an introductory episode. It features many of the themes of the show, in smaller form. We have the TARDIS shown to be able to go *absolutely* anywhere, even to the extremes of time. We have a colorful and imaginative cast of aliens. The Doctor is portrayed as being distant to events at large, but still caring for individuals, like Jabe. Finally, and most importantly, we are shown that time *doesn't have to happen in order.* The Earth is destroyed, but only in the year Five Billion. We see that everything has an end, and that end could happen now, or later, or whenever we wish to see it, but it will always come.

---

Alas, we do not live in that world, so I'd say the best self-contained episode would be *The Waters Of Mars*. This is a fine character piece for the Doctor and tells us almost everything we need to know about the show. 

* Space and time travel? Check.
* Silly/serious clever man? Check.
* Extremely threatening and slightly goofy monsters? Check.

The only reason I wouldn't show this to a newcomer is that they miss out on so much of the subtext. They don't know who the Doctor is or what the rules of time are, so when the Doctor cracks they think it's just him being heroic. The one time I introduced someone to the show with WoM, they punched the air at the ""Time Lord victorious"" speech, and looked over to me, wondering why I had such an expression of horror on my face.

So, yeah, let's just go with *Blink*. Simpler that way.

true,ZoFreX,eng-GreaterLondon,Wimbledon,"Exactly my preference too, Virgin cable if available, if it must be ADSL then go with Be. Be's customer service is wonderful, and although Virgin's isn't great, to date they have never made me jump through a checklist.

Avoid BT, their limits are incredibly restrictive and on some packages you can reach your monthly cap in just 2 hours of downloading.

Sky I really don't like, but they are popular due to their genuinely unlimited service. If you plug in your own router, they disconnect you, so they are 100% ruled out for me. Unacceptable.

Virgin's cable service is great, particularly if you get the larger packages which have less limits and are on a different backbone that has less contention. It does vary a little from area to area, service was definitely better in Bristol than Manchester for me for example. In Bristol, I *always* got 50mb down, and if the internet went out it meant our power had tripped - in 12 months I think it went down due to a fault at Virgin's end just once. Also the 5 megabits up you can get in some areas now is very, very nice.

Virgin ADSL on the other hand... well, I hate all ADSL, but theirs isn't that great. I particularly don't like that the limits between 4pm and 12pm aren't actually stated, but I do like that whatever you do, the cap is lifted at midnight that day, whereas a lot of providers keep you pinned for the rest of the month. Note that this only applies to their ADSL, their Cable policy is much more open - I've added links to both at the bottom of this post.

[Think Broadband](http://www.thinkbroadband.com/) is probably one of the best resources for broadband information in the UK, you can find tonnes of information out about any ISP, see which things their users gripe about, check reviews, typical speeds, and find out more general information too.

Lastly, some tips for getting the most out of your ADSL if you aren't getting the maximum speed. The first thing to try is to disconnect everything except your net, as other equipment on the loop might be interfering, or maybe the cabling inside your house is naff. The best way to do this is to identify the main telephone socket in your house, where the line comes in. If you pop the face plate off it (you'll need a flathead screwdriver to undo the screws) you'll see that it has a socket inside it that the face plate plugs into. Removing that plate disconnects everything else in your house so only that socket works.

Plug your filter and modem in and see if your speeds are any better. If not, maybe you have a noisy line. Plug a handset in (a decent wired one, a cordless one would be no good for this) and dial 17070, and select option 2 for the ""quiet line test"". As the name implies you should hear total silence, if you hear crackling or beeps or bloops or anything at all, your line quality is probably bringing down your ADSL speed.

The next step is to get it fixed, but you do have to tread carefully. I've heard stories that BT will not be of any help at all if you ring them up and want the line checked because your non-BT-provided ADSL is running slow. What I do is I just complain that the line is noisy, rather than mentioning ADSL at all.

The other caveat is that, if there is no fault on the line, BT may charge you for the call out. This is why it's absolutely paramount to rule out other causes first, although they *should* ensure that you ran these tests on the master socket before calling out an engineer anyway.

I've done this before and it can actually make a big difference to ADSL speed and reliability.

Edit: A few updates:

Apparently Be now have a FUP which is enforced, so that sucks.

Sky won't definitely disconnect you if you plug in your own router, there's just a risk of it. I've read posts online of people being disconnected, but one of my friends did this without any problems. You can always ring them and go back to their router if you do get cut off.

Edit2: As someone has pointed out, for 99% of people the ""you must use our router"" thing isn't much of a downside on Sky, their warranty covers the whole kaboodle and they keep it up to date, and it's reliable.

No, but there must be a high bar for it.

Before we spend taxpayer's money we should ask ""did we need to take this money from people and spend it on their behalf, or could they have spent it themselves, perhaps to better effect?"".

In the case of charitable donations, there is no reason why individuals can't make their own choice, it shouldn't be made for them by government.

&gt; He's free to call for it, you're free to oppose it.

But I'm not free to not pay for it if people like him happen to be in the majority.  If they want it, and there are enough of them, let *them* pay for it.  But don't let them force the minority that disagrees with them to pay for it too.

The tyranny of the majority must be balanced by a respect for individual freedom, otherwise there is nothing to prevent the wolves from voting to have the sheep for dinner.  This respect for individual freedom is what has made the UK such a stable country for centuries.

Me and one other immediately asked where and exited the pub at speed while most people were standing around like lemons.

The thoughts that always go through my head are like ""am I sure?"" ""should I really be ringing 999?"" ""am I wasting people's time?"" ""am I overreacting and going to look silly?""

Edit: Didn't make that last part clear. Most people that waste time or act entitled are being dicks about it, people that call ambulances unnecessarily are usually in no doubt at all that they *deserve* an ambulance to take them to hospital because they've gone into labour. Conversely the people that need ambulances the most are the ones that tend to be uncertain, worrying about wasting the operator's time, etc. If you're worried you might be wasting their time, you should probably be ringing.

There has to be a middle way.

For example - would the story have been as interesting if we didn't have Facebook pictures and sensationalist stories?

Outside in the hall, there is a crib that's been pulled just outside the room. It's been stripped of the sheets and is just sitting there, forgotten. I think this is supposed to indicate that Melody had been in that orphanage since she was a baby. Melody also seemed to recognize Amy when they saw each other, whether she knew her to be her mother or the woman from the picture on her dresser, holding her as a baby. This doesn't tell us how old she is or how long she'd been there, but it might give us some idea of how her years were spent between when she's kidnapped after Amy gives birth and when she finds Amy and Rory as Mels.

Something that I thought was quite strange was how knowledgeable child Melody was of what was going to happen to her when she regenerated. So either she'd done it before, or her caretakers (whoever they were) had educated her about the process. And we still don't know what happened between DotM and the sixth months between when she regenerated.

I couldn't care less how fast they go on a motorway or dual carriageway - if they do fuck up they'll *probably* only hurt or kill themselves and the occupants of their own car.

And on the other one, at the very least they are trespassing (ok maybe not technically), but I seriously doubt anyone would be skulking (and that really is the word - sneaking around low to the ground with hoods up) around someone's property for good reason.

Police won't come out if there's no evidence of something bad going on... so if you call because a burglar alarm is going off, they won't come out unless it's a slow night. However, if your neighbour's alarm is going off and you can see someone on the property, they'll be right over.

Also, it depends how long you're making it. I started the infamous scarf for my stepfather eons ago and quickly decided that 1.) it was a daunting and arduous task and 2.) Baker has about a foot on my stepdad and still keeps tripping over his scarf, so I cut the pattern down to a third or a quarter of it's original size (which, when measured out, will still do three or four loops around his neck and touch the floor).

true,Ivashkin,null,null,"&gt; I disagree when you say it won't help the fact that we're spending more than we have, surely spending less (wars, trident, corporate subsidies) and bringing in more tax revenues (evasion, avoidiance, taxes on the rich). What is the annual deficit? If it is under a couple of hundred billion then the above would do it.

The wars issue isn't simple. I know that the group think on reddit is anti-interventionist, especially when it comes to military force, but I would disagree. Sometimes we do need to do it, but the problem is that we don't have a structure to it, and we don't really have a set of workable plans for what to do after we've kicked someones ass. The best example of this was Iraq, getting rid of Saddam was the right thing to do. But in order to do this we had to lie to people and pretend he was a threat to us, which was crap because he wasn't a threat to anyone but his immediate neighbors and more importantly his own people. And once we'd kicked him out of power, we completely fucked up waging peace, wasted the 3-6 months of good grace the Iraqi's gave us and as a result let the country slide into barbarity, thus giving military intervention a bad name. 

Trident, again I know I'm in a minority, but having nukes does allow us to punch above our weight internationally, and ultimately they might be useful. Are the current plans the best option? Probably not, but that doesn't mean we should scrap them, if anything we might want to examine a joint Anglo-French capability when it comes to nukes.

As for the tax code, avoidance, evasion and subsidies. This has been long overdue, but I think UK Uncut try to make the issue far more simple than it actually is. The tax code needs major work, but it also needs patience and a long term view, if we rush this we'll end up in a worse state than we are now. Simply jacking up taxes on the rich won't work, and it's not going to be a short term project.

&gt; As for becoming more competetive, R&amp;D, investment in high technology industries and other things we already have a base in. Not trolling, what would you suggest to right the problems you have correctly pointed to above?

Unfortunately, the fastest solution is one you want to eliminate, corporate subsidies. But otherwise I would agree, however it's not a short term solution, and we need to re-work the education system to ensure that we have the right kind of skills and attitudes to feed those industries.

My main point here is that we don't have any instant fixes, all these solutions need to be done over the long term, with planning. So perhaps the best solution is to call politicians on their bullshit when they plan their economic solutions around elections. We need to start planning for the long term in the UK, all our problems are linked back to instant gratification fudges designed to gain votes rather than fix problems.

Pretty much everyone except you that I've seen comment on the episode seems to be of the impression that Amy's faith in the doctor was destroyed, but the writer's intent seems to have been to make us realise her faith was *restored* again by the end when she realised he was actually sacrificing himself (for the second time that episode) by putting his own feelings last, just to save her.  As you pointed out though, her blind faith has been replaced by a more realistic one now, a more healthy one, even.

Then again, this was actually how I understood the episode while I was watching it, so maybe the writing was fine.

I also think his speech about vanity being the *only* reason he picked her up in the first place was intended to be a lie, as this was specifically the doctor sacrificing his reputation to save Amy's life.  Am I the only one who saw it that way?

If you like the RTD Whos, I suggest just starting at the beginning. A lot of people say the first season is too cheesy/campy, but before Miracle Day I went back and watched the whole series and thought the only *bad/cheesy* episodes were episode 2 (the monster/alien is ridiculous) episode 4 (same. even worse if you watch the Torchwood: Declassified and see RTD talking about how scary it is), and season 2 episode 10 (pretty boring.) The rest of the show is a bit campy, but fun. 

It was meant to be more ""adult"" than Who, but that just meant more talk about sex. It didn't get **really** dark until season 3 (Children of Earth) and then season 4 (Miracle Day). Both of which I liked (3 more than 4) but didn't like how they lost the fun.

Stand out episode from the original run (before it leapt out of the Whoniverse with the miniseries) are Episode 6: Countrycide, and Episode 9: Random Shoes (which doesn't directly follow the Torchwood team). Season 2 episode 4: Meat, is good but only because it makes Rhys fit into the story, and makes most people like him more than they did before it.

Your second paragraph said what I actually meant to say, so you're doing alright yourself.  I expect that part of his reason for picking up Amy really was vanity - that much was written all over his face - but it was *definitely* also because he was worried for her and wanted to help her.  He just needed to torpedo her belief badly in the moment so that she wouldn't get eaten by the Minotaur.  That surely can't be in doubt.

Perhaps the episode was in some way a test of the viewers faith in the Doctor.  I mean, just because he says he's not a hero doesn't mean he isn't.  I'm sure most heroes would just say they did what they thought was the right thing to do, after all.  

Some people in here have been so quick to judge the Doctor negatively for his actions, when in a lot of cases, he did the unpleasant things he had to in order to save people's lives.  Often, because it was the only right thing to do.

It is all a question of perspective, perhaps, but sometimes I feel like I'm on the wrong planet myself.  Those who described his attack on the Silents in Ep2 as ""genocidal"" seem like the type of people who'd sue a fireman for breaking their window while saving their life.

Which is exactly what I said ""the council can achieve a short term financial gain by selling public land.""

Dale Farm's designation as a greenfield site is spurious - it was used as a scrapyard for more than 40 years - during which time *""Brian White, an independent contractor who worked for Bocking, said Basildon council regularly brought waste tarmac and rubble from roadworks and dumped it on Dale Farm for a period of 10 years until the 1990s.

&gt;In the Doctor Who episode, ""The Christmas Invasion"", the Tenth Doctor, appearing in pyjamas and a dressing-gown, compares himself to Arthur Dent, whom he describes as a ""nice man"", possibly suggesting that the Doctor has at some point inhabited the same universe as the characters in the Hitchhiker's Guide. Interestingly, the Fourth Doctor was seen to be reading and criticising a book by Oolon Colluphid in the episode ""Destiny of the Daleks""; Douglas Adams apparently inserted the reference himself while working as a script editor on the show. Alien activity is also explained as 'hallucinations caused by goverment testing' in a Doctor Who episode, a reference to So Long, and Thanks for All the Fish, which had the same explanation.

There is no right answer to this. Ask me right now, I'd say: HELL YES, bring on the adventure. But I might feel differently if me or my loved ones were put into mortal danger over and over again.

NOTES FOR SUBMISSION TO SELECT COMMITTEE ON ABOLITION OF REGIONAL SPATIAL STRATEGIES AND LOCALISM

Adequate site provision, both permanent and transit, is the answer to the problem of unauthorised encampments. The Caravan Sites Act 1968 required local authorities to provide sites for Gypsies and Travellers residing in or resorting to their areas. Unfortunately the duty was repealed in 1994, and although by that time 350 or so local authority Gypsy and Traveller sites had been constructed in England and Wales, there still remained a significant shortfall in site provision. Many local authorities had ignored their statutory duty and the Ministerial power of direction in S 9(2) of the Act had only been used recently and sparingly. The shortfall remains, caused by the failure of successive central governments and local authorities to ensure adequate provision. This has led to the endemic situation of unauthorised encampments and unauthorised developments, and it is essential that a policy of ensuring adequate site provision is promoted if any positive steps are to be made in tackling that problem.

Experience over the last 42 years leads us to conclude that provision of Gypsy and Traveller sites or the allocation of land for sites in local authority plans, is the key to reducing community tensions and enforcement costs as well as improving the life chances of a highly marginalised minority. Conversely, failure to provide sites or to allocate land for them, inevitably leads to proliferation of unauthorised sites, with disastrous effects on the life chances of Travellers and disputes between Travellers and settled communities. To achieve the goal of eliminating unauthorised encampments, financial support needs to be combined with obligations on local authorities to provide sites based on accurate and fair assessments of need with the prospect of government intervention where councils fail to act. We therefore regret the Government's intention to abolish the site targets developed by the Gypsy and Traveller Accommodation Needs Assessment, and refined by public consultation and redistribution of obligations between local authorities. We also deplore the erasure of the guidance contained within Circular 1/2006. These measures were slowly beginning to have some positive impact on reducing the shortfall. The Government is wrong to dismiss this policy as failed and we urge it to reconsider its pledge to repeal these policies.

A key component of the government's new policy is enforcement against unauthorised developments and encampments but there appears to be no reference to enforcement action that may be taken against local authorities who fail to lift a finger to help Gypsies and Travellers address their sites needs. Nearly one in five Gypsies and Travellers are on unauthorised sites, which are to be the target of stronger enforcement powers.

Under the banner of localism councils are to be allowed to determine the number of pitches they need to develop. This is not ""putting fairness back into communities"" as Eric Pickles, Secretary of State for the Communities and Local Government (CLG) recently claimed (CLG Press Release, 28 August, 2010). The right way is to ensure that local authorities grant planning permission for enough sites to accommodate Gypsies and Travellers, for the simple reason they have nowhere else to go. Letting 368 councils decide individually how many pitches they will allow is a recipe for inaction, and promising undefined financial incentives to councils to develop sites themselves cannot have greater effect than the 100% new sites grant which Mr Pickles has abolished.

The abolition of Regional Spatial Strategies (RSS) will also wreck the work done to redistribute the need for pitch provision generated in some areas with large Gypsy and Traveller communities, such as Basildon. The end of such policies of redistribution are implied in the Coalition proposal that councils should make appropriate provision which ""reflect local need and historic demand"". Redistribution via the RSS has proven popular with a number of Conservative councils who have seen their pitch targets reduced and neighbouring authorities compelled to develop sites, who it has been argued with some justification had managed to avoid their obligations to Gypsies and Travellers in the past. This begs the question of how widely the repeal of RSSs has been discussed with those responsible for local government.

As noted the Coalition government says that site provision must be based on local need and historic demand. In London the Mayor Boris Johnson is seeking to drastically reduce London's identified pitch requirements by claiming that there is not enough land and by dismissing the needs of housed Gypsies and Travellers who have been forced into housing by the shortage of sites and who have a legitimate need to live on sites. The stance taken by the London Mayor is not acceptable in London or elsewhere and it is hoped that it will not creep into new guidance on who is to be included and excluded in Gypsy and Traveller accommodation policies.

It should be noted that a considerable number of Gypsies and Travellers are facing eviction on unauthorised developments like Dale Farm. These Gypsies and Travellers have been left in some uncertainty since the general election and indications of major policy change. For example, talks between Essex authorities including Basildon and the Local Government Association, Homes and Communities Agency and the Government Office East to find alternative sites within Essex for Dale Farm residents have been stalled by the announcement by Eric Pickles abolishing the targets for site provision set through the RSS and Gypsy and Traveller Accommodation Assessments; the announcement has encouraged all local authorities, not just those in Essex, to conclude that they have no obligation to identify suitable land for site development, or to identify sites which could be offered to homeless Gypsies and Travellers, such as those from Dale Farm. If constructive dialogue is to continue in Essex and elsewhere, then the government ought to encourage a moratorium on eviction action to give local authorities the opportunity to adopt and comply with its new policy and reassess the need for accommodation with their areas and to explore the new financial incentives that the government has indicated may be available for site provision.

It should be noted that in its report of March 2010 the European Commission against Racism and Intolerance in its fourth periodic report on the UK expressed concern about the eviction of Gypsies and Travellers. The Commission found (para 153) that:

""An excessive emphasis on enforcement (ie eviction), involving often protracted and expensive litigation, instead of seeking forward-looking solutions in consultation with all members of the local community, has also been shown to damage race relations"".

The Commission recommended (para 156) that:

"".. the UK authorities encourage local authorities to treat enforcement measures—legitimate though they are—as a last resort, and to privilege wherever possible an approach aimed at bridging gaps between communities and finding mutually acceptable solutions rather than approaches that will inevitably place groups in opposition to each other "".

Thus, in the interests of averting costly and dangerous evictions and having regard to principles of proportionality laid down in the European Convention on Human Rights we would argue that the government should discourage forced evictions so that Gypsies and Travellers can acquaint themselves with the proposed new policy regime and work within it to seek constructive alternatives to eviction.

Given the reluctance of local authorities to allocate land for Gypsies and Travellers and the consensual support for the previous government's policies, we believe that Mr Pickles' decision to scrap the existing site targets and the prospect of government intervention where councils fail to act is wholly irrational. The policy which Mr Pickles now wishes to abolish would have ensured that sites would be provided, and thus unauthorised encampments eliminated. However, if there is to be change then in order to avoid a ""Balkanising effect"" of letting individual councils make planning and development decisions, the creation of local partnerships of sub-regions and city regions with statutory planning powers could offer a way forward (see Professor Alan Townsend, Guardian, 21 May, 2010). This is a compromise between RSS and localism. Such a framework could be delivered through the proposed Local Enterprise Partnerships which also form part of the remit of the Select Committee inquiry and which the government has indicated may have a planning role.",0,1316642110,null,0,false,0,c2llke7,t3_kkcuj,t1_c2llke7,t1_c2lgky0,1427629949,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

This is not MMA at all....

What the two 8 year olds are doing is known as 'Grappling'. If you go the US you will find hundreds of thousands of children doing this every day (some as young as five) and it's called collegiate wrestling, it is no different. The main difference here is the cage which is making everyone hysterical. The actual cage itself also widely misunderstood, its not anything to with 'animals locked in cage', it's for safety reasons. Originally we used traditional boxing rings, but the risk is that you can fall out as a lot of throws are used + we 'roll around on the ground' for want of a better expression.

It also not too different to Judo and the root of the particular discipline those kids are practising 'Brazilian Jiu Jitsu' is a direct descendent of Judo. Everything those kids are doing is taught to youngsters under the Olympic body called 'BJA' (British Judo Association). I would say Judo is more dangerous as you are being literally thrown on the floor which can lead to broken bones and dislocations. 

Also you say MMA is Dangerous? Since 1995, there have been 123 deaths in Cheerleading. Cheerleading has also left 782 people paralyzed. Do you know how many deaths or serious injuries resulting in paralyzation there has been in Mixed Martial Arts? Zero. 

I am quite used to people attacking MMA without even knowing what they are talking about and every time the following seems most apt..

	
""There is a principle which is a bar against all information,
   which is proof against all arguments, and which cannot fail
   to keep a man in everlasting ignorance—that principle is
   contempt prior to investigation.""

But thats the point. You're assuming they made a balanced assessment. My local council are trying to make a few streets around my house 20mph speed limits. These very same roads already have speed bumps on that prevent cars from doing 30mph anyway. The pointless effort they are going through to reduce the speed limit shows that they haven't made a balanced assessment in this case. I wonder if that's the case with this road too.

One thing I've learnt, councils aren't that smart.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt;Doctor Who's ratings are in freefall, are they? Well, they are if you believe The Sun, The Guardian, and a number of other newspapers. In fact, this myth is spreading so quickly that people might actually start BELIEVING it! But let's take a look at why this simply ISN'T TRUE.
&gt;
&gt;For the purposes of this, let's ignore all the Specials (the Christmas episodes, plus the 2009 one-offs), as they rather distort averages. So let's just look at each 13-part run, and look at viewings within the first seven days only, so everything is on as equal a playing field as possible.
&gt;
&gt;2005 SERIES (13 eps: Rose to The Parting of the Ways)
&gt;
&gt;Average BBC One final BARB rating: 7.95 million
&gt;
&gt;Average BBC Three rating for first week repeats: 0.73 million
&gt;
&gt;Average audience across all outlets (ie BBC One &amp; BBC Three): 8.68 million
&gt;

&gt;
&gt;Average audience across all outlets (ie BBC One &amp; BBC Three): 8.72 million
&gt;
&gt;2007 SERIES (13 eps: Smith and Jones to Last of the Time Lords)
&gt;
&gt;Average BBC One final BARB rating: 7.55 million
&gt;
&gt;Average BBC Three rating for first week repeats: 1.34 million
&gt;
&gt;Average audience across all outlets (ie BBC One &amp; BBC Three): 8.89 million
&gt;
&gt;2008 SERIES (13 eps: Partners in Crime to Journey’s End)
&gt;
&gt;Average BBC One final BARB rating: 8.05 million
&gt;
&gt;Average BBC Three rating for first week repeats: 1.64 million
&gt;
&gt;Average BBC iPlayer views for first week views: 0.51 million
&gt;
&gt;Average audience across all outlets (ie BBC One, BBC Three &amp; iPlayer): 10.20 million
&gt;
&gt;2010 SERIES (13 eps: The Eleventh Hour to The Big Bang)
&gt;
&gt;Average BBC One final BARB rating: 7.70 million
&gt;
&gt;Average BBC Three and BBC HD ratings for first week repeats: 1.01 million
&gt;
&gt;Average BBC iPlayer views for first week views: 1.14 million
&gt;
&gt;Average audience across all outlets (ie BBC One, BBC HD, BBC Three &amp; iPlayer): 9.85 million
&gt;
&gt;2011 SERIES (first 9 episodes only, for which full figures are currently available)
&gt;
&gt;Average BBC One final BARB rating: 7.64 million
&gt;
&gt;Average BBC Three ratings for first week repeats: 0.99 million
&gt;
&gt;Average BBC iPlayer views for first week views: 1.14 million
&gt;
&gt;Average audience across all outlets (ie BBC One, BBC HD, BBC Three &amp; iPlayer): 9.77 million
&gt;
&gt;The general trends I would note are as follows:
&gt;
&gt;* Even if you just include final BBC One figures, the lowest rated series is 2007’s (7.55 million), and the highest is 2008’s (8.05 million). For all six series to fall within these slim boundaries, is remarkable.
&gt;
&gt;* For the first few years, the slight drop in BBC One ratings was more than made up for by increasing BBC Three figures.
&gt;
&gt;* When iPlayer first comes in (2008 series), we are slightly altering the playing field, as the earlier series didn’t have this as an option. Understandably, this has helped the ‘total’ figures – but even if we assume that a small handful of iPlayer viewers are repeat viewers, Doctor Who is still well up on its 2005 numbers. Indeed, even if we IGNORE iPlayer altogether, and ONLY focus on BBC One and BBC Three screenings, the 2010 and 2011 series are easily on a par with the 2005, 2006 and 2007 series.
&gt;
&gt;* The 2008 series is the standout performer – but only by a small margin in front of the other five series. This can partially be put down to the final half of the series which concluded with Journey’s End, the return of Rose, the return of Davros, the fake regeneration etc etc. Journey’s End was the top rated show of the week, and amassed almost 15 million viewers across all outlets, so this really gave a boost to the series average.
&gt;
&gt;So, why do we get these tabloid reports of Doctor Who's falling ratings? Well, that's because they're reporting OVERNIGHTS – which means the number of people that watched the show 'live' on BBC One each Saturday. The BARB figures I've listed above are FINAL figures, which include those who record the programme to watch back within seven days. Hence, an episode like 'A Good Man Goes to War', shown in June, may have a reported overnight rating of 5.5 million, but its final BARB rating was 7.5 million (plus BBC Three and iPlayer views, of course, which actually take the episode's total audience well over 9 million).
&gt;
&gt;Doctor Who tends to add far more viewers via 'timeshifting' (recordings, repeats or iPlayer) than live shows – or even other dramas – and so when newspapers report overnight ratings, they are doing the series a dissevice.

I said ""I also think his speech about vanity being the only reason he picked her up in the first place was intended to be a *lie*"" but the emphasis should have been on the *only*, and not on the lie.  

What I mean is that he *was* surely telling the truth about picking Amy up out of vanity and a need to be adored, you can see this much from the expression of pain on his face as he admits it, **but** my intented point was that he also picked Amy up for good, selfless reasons as well, such as her family being missing and the crack putting her in massive danger.  

For the sake of saving Amy from the Minotaur, however, it was essential that he deny this in the moment and shake her faith in him, so basically this is quite possibly a redeeming act on the Doctor's part, as he would unquestioningly sacrifice his worshipful standing with Amy if it meant saving her, as well as having the side effect of finally treating her as an adult on his part, too.

With regard to your second paragraph on defensiveness, I like the way the Doctor usually tends to outight lie only when there's a very good reason for doing so; the rest of the time, when faced with a question he really doesn't like, he just changes the subject so blatantly and brazenly that even Rory usually can't bring himself to say, ""Hang on, why can't you just answer the question?""",0,1316648134,null,0,true,0,c2lmedv,t3_kmsxn,t1_c2lmedv,t1_c2lm8wn,1427630419,1,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,1

It has been a shaky start I agree, but first match of the season AT Old Trafford and we hang with them for 60 minutes is not bad. The match against City was forgettable, I agree, but I believe both the subsequent wins were signs of what is to come moving forward. Wolves is NEVER an easy place to go and get three points and Liverpool spent what, 60 million this summer(?), in an attempt to get back into the Top 4 and we all know what happened Sunday.

In my honest opinion, while it is too bad we won't compete for this trophy, the ONLY focus this year should be getting back into the top 4 and getting out of the group stages of the Europa League.

Thursdays is pressure, and it's shit. It's all the college/sixth-form kids getting on 2-for-1 drinks.

Friday night is this new club night called 52 27 or something, they play proper garage and dub and that. It starts off slow but it was a really fun night, everyone was dancing and I was drunk as fuck.

true,Lyme,troughton,Troughton,"It seems almost a consensus that Blink is the scariest episode because of the weeping angels, but I think Midnight is far scarier. I agree with horror writers who say that the scariest monsters are the ones you don't ever see, because your imagination will inevitably fill in with something worse than they could've thought of. In Midnight, you never see the monster, never learn a *damn* thing about it. 

The episode as a whole has a lot more scary elements. You've got an inhospitable, kills-you-instantly environment. Then you have the small group of strangers trapped in the transport vehicle with no escape and any chance of rescue hours away. Then something bangs on the outside of the ship - which doesn't have a window you can open and look out of to see what's going on - and it takes over one of the people in the ship who repeats everything anyone says. All while staring at you in a way that the actress playing Skye manages to make pretty fucking malevolent. 

And that leads to the paranoia amongst the people on the ship and the panic and the chosing sides and making average people plot to do horrible things. 

What really gets me about the episode, though, is after the creature in Skye overtakes the Doctor so he's trapped repeating everything she says. While the people are grabbing him and dragging him towards the door, you can just see the absolute terror in the Doctor's face. Somehow, *that* makes it even scarier, because the Doctor knows how very close he comes to death, and not at the hands of some big epic foe with plans for universal domination/destruction, but at the hands of average people. 


And it's not a happy ending. In Blink, the two main characters get together and live happily ever after. Even those who get touched by the angels still have the opportunity to live out a full life, even if it's in the past. In Midnight, the hostess sacrifices herself to drag Skye out of the ship to save the others, and nobody she saved even knows her name. That's pretty depressing.

true,[deleted],null,null,"How many times have people complained about the Doctor ""lording alien authority"" over humans, and then begged him to save them from the actual monsters?

Does the phrase ""if you could choose who lived and who died, wouldn't that make you a god?"" (with the response being ""I wouldn't be a very good god - you wouldn't get a day off"") not ring *any* bells at all?

How many times has he tried to save the Daleks - even while they tried to kill everyone everywhere everywhen?

How many times has he tried to persuade the monsters to go with him to another planet instead of eating all the humans?

How many times has he saved people - even after they tell him what a monster he is?

How many times have people grizzled that there's always death and destruction wherever and whenever he turns up, and ignored the fact that the Doctor was the one trying to stop it?

I know postmodernism, like bow ties, is cool these days - but there comes a point when you have to wonder why the only people calling the doctor a ""monster"" are people who's plans for genocide were stopped by the Doctor, and wonder if perhaps their opinion doesn't count.

&gt; So, which is it? Is the Doctor worth the monsters? Or his he a monster who people should flee from, especially if he offers you all of time and space? 

He sent Martha walking the earth - not to find a weapon to kill the Master, but to tell a story - and when the Doctor escaped his prison, he committed the ultimate atrocity that qualifies him as a monster deserving of death - he gave the bad guy a big hug.

I may be insane, but if postmodern deconstruction has led people to believe that this is best described as ""what a monster, he turned Martha into a weapon"" then I'd be more than happy to screw the cynical prats investing this planet and sign up with the Doctor.

&gt; Or are we being set up for a big moment of redemption?

Post-modernisim doesn't actually allow heroes, so he's not going to be ""redeemed"" and we're going to have season after season of ""the Doctor is the worst villain in the universe"". I hope that's what you like.

I may have made it clear that I don't think he is in need of ""redemption"" anyway.

An old creature, traveling space, picking up companions, gaining their faith, then witnessing their untimely parting.  This fits both the Minotaur and the Doctor (consider how much larger the Minotaur's ship seemed on the outside compared to the inside due to the constant shifting of the ""hotel"").

What is most revealing is that the Minotaur tells the Doctor that death would be a relief because all he is now is ""instinct."" 

What does the Doctor have left?  He only lives for his curiosity and his natural urge to help others. One feeds the other though and, as he realized with Amy, eventually his curiosity gets someone killed.

true,Dain42,tardis,TARDIS,"And now my actual response to your points. Overall, I agree the Doctor is good. Of course I do. Does anyone here actually ***not*** think that. (Hell, I don't think Moffat thinks the doctor is horrible or bad, even as he's running this plotline.)

But he could, at the least, be called careless sometimes.

Yes, Ten always tried to give his enemies (or those who set themselves up as his enemies, more accurately) a choice and a chance.  But, really, we've seen less of this with Eleven, I'd point out.

And yes, the fact that he's often around when terrible things are happening does result in him getting blamed for them instead of recognized as just turning up at the same time.

But he does put his companions through a hell of a lot, though. And yes, they do come willingly. But, well, he said it, offer them all of time and space, and who wouldn't take it?

In the most recent episode, for example, sure the overall situation was actually improved by his coming. (If he hadn't been there, those people still would have died. And Gibbis would have, too. AND the space-prison-hotel would have just gone on scooping up people to turn into food.) But Amy and Rory weren't. They ended up being put in danger. Again. And one of them got hurt pretty badly. Again.

So we get a sort of Catch-22, if he keeps inviting people along with him, even knowing that in the end, likelier than not, they're going to end up emotionally damaged (at the least) or even dead...what kind of person does that make him if he keeps inviting them along?  (I don't, by the way, think that his companions all end up wrecks...but he certainly seems to feel that way---or at least feels they'd have been better off without him.  And if he feels that way and still continues to do it...it says much the same thing about his character in that respec)

But...we've seen how he gets without a companion...so if he just journeys about through space and time alone...what does he end up becoming?


EDIT: One last thing re: redemption: after the past few episodes, yeah, he could do with a bit of redemption...his behaviour in [TGWW, (spoiler)](/s ""giving old Amy hope only so he could use her and then take it away..."") *was* actually pretty appalling, if nothing else has been.

What he needs is redemption in *his* eyes. Something to tell him that he's not a force for ill, that he doesn't just wreck those around him.",0,1316667681,null,0,true,0,c2lozno,t3_kmv1c,t1_c2lozno,t1_c2lo8jl,1427631630,1,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,1

The Doctor has seen himself as something of a protector of earth and humans, so it adds another dimension of horror to see how his faith in us can be ruined so quickly.

And the *monster*. We don't ever see it. We don't have a name for it. We don't understand the first thing about it, other than it apparently somehow survived in an environment that supposedly no living thing could survive.

true,jimbelk,null,null,"I've dabbled with watching some old Who.  The best that I've seen is Genesis of the Daleks, and the Douglas Adams ones are also quite good.  Overall, old Doctor Who tends to suffer from pacing problems, but it can still be quite good. Here are my experiences so far, in the order that I watched them:

The Pirate Planet (4th doctor):  Hilarious and fun.  Douglas Adams is an awesome scriptwriter, and Tom Baker is the best old doctor.

City of Death (4th doctor):  Again Douglas Adams and Tom Baker.  Much more interesting plotwise than The Pirate Planet, but not quite as funny.

Earthshock (5th doctor):  Reasonably good one with the cybermen.  I wish I hadn't watched this so early, because it helps to be more familiar with the companions.  There's a big plot twist that's not as interesting if you haven't seen the episodes leading up to this one.

The Caves of Androzani (5th doctor).  Unremittingly bleak but reasonably good.  I don't dislike it, but it seems to me that this episode is a bit overrated.

Spearhead From Space (3rd doctor):  The first serial with Jon Pertwee, and the first appearance of the Autons.  Not as interesting as Tom Baker stuff, but the Brigadier is a really cool character.

The Three Doctors (3rd doctor, plus 1st and 2nd):  Absolutely terrible and campy.  Based on this, I have no idea why anyone would ever want Omega to come back as a villain.

The Green Death (3rd doctor):  A bit boring overall.  The third doctor just isn't as watchable as later doctors, and it really hurts the show.

The Ark in Space (4th doctor):  Early Tom Baker serial.  Has a very different feel than the later Douglas Adams stuff.  I liked this one a lot.

Genesis of the Daleks (4th doctor):  Amazingly good.  Davros functions here as the single best villain in any Doctor Who that I have seen.  Completely changed my perspective on the Daleks.

Pyramids of Mars (4th doctor):  Pretty good, again with a high-quality villain.  Vaguely Lovecraftian.

The Talons of Weng-Chiang (4th doctor):  This one was ok, but it dragged on for a bit too long.  Hilariously stereotypical and borderline racist portrayal of Chinese characters.

Horror of Fang Rock (4th doctor):  This is trying for gothic horror, but I found it dreary and predictable.  I miss Sarah Jane!

The Ribos Operation (4th doctor):  Very interesting to start with, but suddenly becomes completely uninteresting when they arrive at the medieval world.  I actually turned this serial off halfway through.",0,1316671060,null,0,true,0,c2lpbu4,t3_knhrv,t1_c2lpbu4,t3_knhrv,1427631789,3,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,3

I'm not saying that the council necessarily *did* make a balanced assessment.  But *if* they did, then I see no problem with speeding motorists getting tickets. 

If the council *didn't* make a balanced assessment (which I accept does happen) then it's a different kettle of fish.

But both cuts are pretty awful. The myopic economic system we have, lead by short-term greedy businessmen and politicians is now seriously impeding scientific and technological development - surely this cannot be allowed to continue, it doesn't benefit anyone!

true,abw,cnty-uk,Surrey,"&gt; Something bad happens regularly enough.

Sadly, yes.  My sister's boyfriend was killed (20-odd years ago, not that it changes anything) by an oncoming driver overtaking another car on a blind corner.  The police reckon the other driver (a young man, no surprise there) was doing about 60 in a 30 limit.  My sister's boyfriend was killed instantly.  The other guy walked away.

I was about 20 at the time and it stopped me from driving like a twat overnight.  The sad thing is that until then I thought I was great driver because I could drive really fast and hadn't ever had an accident.  There's nothing like seeing someone you love completely and utterly devastated to give you a reality check.  I was with her when she got the news on the telephone.  I had to hold her up because she literally couldn't stand up.  Shit.  You never forget things like that.

20 years later, I'm pleased to say that I continue to drive like an old fogey.  Life is too short to worry about getting somewhere 2 minutes sooner.

&gt;  Instead they chase down people on straight highways because it gives them a bigger figure to report.

In my opinion, this is one of the biggest problems with have in society today - the fact that politicians, police forces, schools, hospitals, you name it, are all judged by league tables of statistics that are easily manipulated in order to make it look like they're doing more than they really are.

Being *seen* to be doing something ends up being more important than actually *doing* something.

That vintage Torres was the one man in the world you'd want running on to a through ball - you could argue that Drogba was a more complete striker, but that made Torres the second best striker in the world at that time, if you were playing to his strengths (which we were).

Suarez is a very different player; less clinical in the finish but much cleverer in terms of approach play, passing and awareness. I see him as a player in the Dalglish or Beardsley mould, who should be paired with an instinctive finisher like a Rush, Aldridge or Fowler, who would then be claiming the lion's share of a 50+ goal partnership.

What about Suarez + Torrez then? Suarez's strengths lie in close passing around the opposition penalty area, whereas Torres was at his very best on the break, with space to knock the ball into and outpace his marker. So perhaps that's a complementary combination that should succeed in all types of game rather than a partnership to build a team around.

I think it isn't irrelevant - the council were happy to use this site as a dump. I read on the Save Our Gloucester Park Facebook page: *""Did you know that Ball has plans to build houses on the main road next to Dale Farm, think that's what its all about. Another nice little earner put on hold.""*

What is my 'liberal' interpretation of the other developments in the area? 12,000 people petitioned against Gloucester Park and were ignored by the council - the sale of public green spaces to fund an olympic village for elite atheletes is a bloody disgrace.

Turns out, their policy is two boxes of painkillers max. Doesn't matter they sell a box of 24. If you buy 2 x 12 because they're out of stock, you're at the limit.

Our class based society has now undergone an inversion where showing any interest in food marks you out as a pretentious middle class twat (in my case that's nothing to do with food). 

Increasing urbanisation means that many people no longer even realise that food is seasonal, a Findus hot pocket is always in the freezer aisle so why shouldn't grapes be?

Also the lack of time most of us has does contribute. I'm lucky, I work from home 3 days a week and at lunchtime I can wander down to the market and buy fruit, veg, meat, fish, eggs for the next two days. What I can't buy from the market is bread and milk, there is bread available but £3+ for a loaf which will last 2 days is too much for me.

The market isn't expensive. I bought the following today

* 4 figs for £1.20
* 2Kg of Maris Piper for £1.10
* Punnet of strawberries - £1
* 1 Kg of red onions - £0.70
* 100g of chantrelle - £1
* 4 corn on the cob - £1


The other day I bought a whole salmon which was a decent size for £10 and they filleted it for me. That's a routine deal. My only issue with the fishmonger is the amount of frozen produce, I hate the taste of some fish if it's ever been frozen.

Meat, there's a butchers stall which is all free range. Two chickens for £10 which taste better than the 3 for £10 in Tesco's.

What I'm saying is I think our shape shifted to a 4-4-1 once Alex was red carded and Terry came in. Malouda pushed out wide and Kalou played as a right winger. Both players came forward in attack but that's just how they naturally move, and since we were a man down that's probably what was asked of them, to operate as wingers and wide forwards.

If we took off Kalou, we'd have no one who could play on the right wing. We already had three CMs on the pitch and I think taking off Josh and dropping the wide forwards back allowed us more flexibility.

true,[deleted],null,null,"I worked as a street fundraiser about 6 years ago and couldn't work out how it made any money.

I was paid £7.50/h and on average managed 4 signups a day for an average of £8/month, only 3 of those signups would convert into a proper signup (two payments made).

So in an 7 hour days I was being paid £52.50 and was through an agency so my daily cost was closer to £80. There was one manager out with us to supervise a team of 4 so even if they were paid the same as me the management cost would bring my daily charge up to £100 a day.

So my three successful signups brought in £24/month meaning that it took 4 months just to cover the cost of the day. This isn't taking into account any of the other costs associated with getting the signup.

So my questions are

* How cost effective is direct fundraising compared to radio/tv/letter campaigns?

* Is it actually another way of telling people about the charity in an effort to get them to donate at a later date.

* Why is there no mechanism for one off donations?

* I'd turn away at least 4 people a week who only had building society accounts, does this mean that you are not effectively tapping the poorer end of the market?

* Do you feel the collection density in some areas is such that it's now actively harming charities?

&gt;Warlocks are, among historic Christian traditions, said to be the male equivalent of witches. Likewise, in traditional Scottish witchcraft warlock was and is simply the term used for a male witch.[1]

true,neonmantis,null,Derby International,"1 - It is not cost effective in the short term which is why only the big boy charities do it. You need a lot of cash to front it and you will only start to see income two years on. It worked a lot better before the recession when there was much less of a donor turnover. BUT if you can get a stack of people signed up to regular giving it is one of the more sustainable income streams and you can develop the donor to give more or volunteer. Almost every other income stream could collapse year to year but regular donors are like golddust. 

Anything like TV, Radio or big DM campaigns just take a lot of front loading so it is the charities with lots of cash in the bank, generally. The returns exist, but they are over a medium term of 2-5 years and if you keep them for life then you're set. 

2 - No, it would be far too expensive for that and they are aware that a lot of unsuccesful pitches may actually put people off. 

3 - It's part of the contract between the PFO's (Professional Fundraising Orgs) and the charity. Security in a way, it's also not the charity or the PGO's preferred result so they don't wish to encourage it. Plus they would want all of your details for reciepting and future badgering anyway. 

4 - On street campaigns yes, building societies can only do standing orders and not direct debits. It is the same as turning down cash donations in a sense. Most charities will have a broad range of FR activities designed to extract cash from as many audiences as possible, rich and poor. You don't hear about major donor fundraisers wining and dining the wealthy for the occasional £1m donation every few years. 

5 - Absolutely it is, but it tends to be leviathon sized charities doing it who don't care about local reputations so much. The thing which really gets to me, as a fundraiser for a regional blind charity, we are allowed to hold just two street collections per year, despite the fact we are based there. PFO's pay the councils for the commercial street pitches and can be there every single day forever. That's one more cost you forgot too actually, wherever they are collecting they will have paid to be there. There is massive charity fatigue now and fortunately people are becoming more savvy about who they donate to and why, checking spends on admin and the rest. 

There are some charities (cough, guide dogs, nspcc) who have bucketloads of cash, way too much, yet continue to aggressively fundraise at the cost of other charities more in need of funding. Give me a shout if you need anything clarifying.  ",0,1316705384,null,0,true,0,c2lroxw,t3_knwjp,t1_c2lroxw,t1_c2lr5pb,1427632903,5,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,5

The taboo of physical contact between children and male teachers is ridiculous, sexist and, quite frankly, offensive.

It's also tragic because children love and thrive on physical affection and sometimes they don't get it at home.

true,CharlieDancey,cnty-england,England,"Hmmm. There may be more to this story.

While I agree that, on paper, it all seems very innocent on the teacher's part and excessive on the part of the authorities, to have treated him this way, you have to consider that there are certain social boundaries regarding who may hug whom and *usually* teachers do not hug their pupils or indulge in the sort of horseplay (like swinging kids around) that is perfectly normal and un-weird when the adult is a parent, close relative or close family friend.

Read the following anecdotal evidence and tell me whether, or at what point, things cross the line, in your opinion.

* * *

From the ages of seven to thirteen, back in the 1960's (yes, that old), I was educated at the Dragon School in Oxford, England, where I had a teacher, a Mr. Dyson who used to keenly supervise his pre-pubescent pupils especially with regard to showering and keeping an eye out for boyish high jinks or misbehaviour during changing room nakedness. It was a boy's school.

On one memorable day, took his boys for a cross country run at the end of which he threw himself onto a grassy bank and encouraged the boys to race to jump on top of him in a great big pile as if he was the prize for being first, which everybody did to much hilarity. 

He never *did* anything lewd to any of us, but in his history lessons he had an unusual passion for describing in ghoulish detail medieval methods of torture and execution.

Mild corporal punishment, like a firmish slap on the arse in front of the class for, say, failing to have completed homework, was normal in those days. He would typically carry out such a punishment, in front of the class, a couple of times a week. So one cannot accuse him of wrongdoing for simply having complied with standard practice, and his slaps were designed to sting a bit, but certainly not to injure...

...but they were savoured and enjoyed very much by Dyson, who made a great play of tightening the shorts of his victim over the buttocks to form a smooth and firm target, and he would also expostulate on the technique of matching the curve of his large hand to the buttocks by first placing it on the kid's arse so as to match the curvature, before tensing his finger muscles to hold the shape for the blow, which should, he explained, produce a very specific sound if done properly.

Technique-wise he was extremely good at smacking, which hinted of long practice, and while the blow would shock the victim and leave them with a warm arse for a few minutes, it was not what I would call cruel or inhumane.

He was a good teacher, and despite what we recognised, even at our young ages, as mild perversion, we did not dislike being his pupils.

He was very sporty. He liked running, cycling and contact sports like Rugby (that's American Football without all the showbiz and body armour).

He wore a disgustingly old and semi-rotten sweatshirt when running. His unusually prominent nipples had worn two holes about and inch and a half in diameter right through it, so they poked through like eyes looking through a yellowed klu-klux-klan mask –which was curiously obscene and could hardly have been accidental.

He had an unusually large penis, which hung at around eight inches in its flaccid state, and when indulging in sporting activities his shorts did not seem to have been chosen to conceal or contain the movements of this impressive member. There would have been no mystery about it anyway since he regularly stripped off and showered alongside his boys, even explaining, by way of demonstration, the importance of washing under the foreskin with plenty of soap and hot water. 

I have to remind you that this was the 1960's, and all this took place at an English ""prep"" school –which is like an English ""public school"" but for boys under 14. A ""public school"" is the English term for a private (i.e. fee-paying) school. Confused? I fucking was. Anyway, my point is that a certain amount of violence and sexual perversion has always been accepted in these places, and especially so forty-odd years ago.

So was Dyson a nonce? (English prison slang for sexual pervert, esp. child molester) Should he have been sacked as a teacher? Clearly he enjoyed physical contact with young boys, and he liked to smack them, but in a fairly playful manner. Clearly he enjoyed be something of a sexual exhibitionist. But he did not, as I have said before, do anything that you could call serious sexual abuse. Neither was his corporal punishment what you could call serious *physical* abuse. 

Nobody, as far as I know, was traumatised or seriously damaged by Dyson's peculiar personal style. And he was, as I said before, a very good teacher.

* * *

I found out later that, some years before my time with him, Dyson had been working at another school in Oxford and had been scandalously caught in the act of homosexual fun and games with two boys (though they were consenting participants and in their late teens). 

In an early example of the way the Catholic Church has typically dealt with such matters it was agreed that Dyson would resign from his post and become a monk for a few years while the heat died down. He was then re-employed by my school, presumably on the understanding that he was to refrain from fucking the boys. 

Which he did.

true,JB_UK,null,null,"This submission has a strange title. The Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council is not ceasing to exist, and I'd argue that pretty much anything they fund is a hard science. There are two issues here, first that the EPSRC is facing a 15% real-terms cut over the next 2-3 years, which is bad, if not apocalyptic. It seems that the total budget for science and technology is being ring-fenced, but the research councils [are being squashed by budget over-runs in big science projects](http://www.theregister.co.uk/2011/09/15/phd_funding_cuts/).

Politicians rely on the fact that the majority of people who would vote against them (as a whole) don't bother voting.  As long as the 60% or so of faithful Tory/Labour voters keep making it a 2 horse race, they're laughing.

They know that perhaps 10 or 20 per cent of people are smart enough to question what they read/hear and realise that the whole theatre of politics is a joke.  But they just don't care about people like us.  We can think whatever we like.  As long as it's a 2 horse race, they only need to convince 25% of the people to vote for them.

Hang on a minute, they're not in power.  I agree that they've turned out to be pretty bad as ""hangers on"" and I can't understand why Clegg is so quick to roll over and have his belly rubbed by David Cameron.  But they're essentially powerless from what I can tell.  They've allowed themselves (and all of us) to be fucked over by the Tories and they don't seem to realise the power that they've got in being able to end the Tories' reign of power whenever they like.  That really is a disappointment. 

&gt; I don't see any point in taking part in voting since unless there were to be a major shift/reform in politics, my vote would continue to be meaningless.

I'm right with you there.  But you have to consider the fact that the big 2 parties are relying on precisely this kind of apathy/disappointment to maintain the status quo.  Next time around there will be no significant Lib Dem/other vote and the majority will ping-pong back to the labour party for 5 more years of their silly nonsense.  I'm guessing that's why Clegg looks so sad these days.  He knows he's Cameron's poodle and if he doesn't play along there will be a general election and he'll be joining the dole queue.

true,RenewableTruth,null,null,"Right then, in proper form I shall counter each argument. 

1. An image of angel is an angel...and the angels in Flesh and Stone were originally one Weeping Angel landed onto the planet, and the inhabitants stupidly made images of it....maybe recorded a 5 min clip, and every frame of it became an angel... 

1A. This is sad because it means the person watching the show who wrote this article didn't pay attention to the story line at all. (/s ""The Doctor has a revelation mid episode about no one knowing what happened the the two headed people who used to live on the planet. but wait all the statues have only one head? everyone turn off your light *click* and on *click* the statues moved, they are all weeping angels. not made by the video no these Angels are what destroyed this civilization. Having run out of energy they went comatose and started to crumble. Until the ship crashed releasing radiation and feeding the angels. Only one angel was made from the video and only one other angel was brought to the planet on that ship."")

2. We don't quite know if an angel can look at itself...we know they can't look at each other...but we've never been shown what happens when they observe themselves...since they are aware of their own existence...it's a bit odd to say that they can't observe themselves.... 

2A. Any living object that looks at the Angel instantly time locks the Angel via the Angels self preservation instincts. This includes itself.

3. The angel from the image of an angel is the original angel? Maybe this is not that reproduction method, and merely a projection or fracturing of some sort... 

3A. The image of an Angel influenced by an Angel is an Angel. It is not teleportation the Angels expend energy to create more Angels (presumably a lot of energy).

4. The angel from the image of an angel and the original angel can observe each other as they are one and the same? This would explain how they can move together in Flesh and Stone...and it makes sense to have an army of lonely assassins....because the army is just one individual, otherwise it isn't very lonely isn't it...(the angels in Flesh and Stone also seems more or less hive-minded...but the ones in Blink were just like...hobos wandering around not knowing what to do) 

4A. The Angel's were not looking at themselves they were looking ahead. And even if they were looking at each other they only moved when the lights went out, meaning they would not be able to see each other.

5. The photo that didn't become an angel in Blink just hasn't become an angel or manifested yet...or convenient theory, because the original Angel is quantum locked, it can't manifest?!?

5A. The Angel the picture was based off of did not have enough energy to bring the other Angel to life.

6. The stupid looking at the eyes print an angel onto your brain thing...because the angels usually cover their eyes, so it's rare for a victim to look at their eyes to begin with...I remember there were a few close-up shots of an angel with eyes uncovered....It only works with angels of an image of an angel? the Angel has to be calm (or look calm) to use it...and doesn't use it in hunting mode (as the closeups in Blink shows the angel freezed in the middle of an action)? There was a imprinted brain Angel in blink but it's just quantum locked before it manifested due to the original one being so? Or super convenient theory: an angel only does it occassionally despite that they can? 

6A. The Angel in the video from ''The Time of Angels'' had enough energy to spare in order to implant itself into Amy (it was directly draining the power of the ship Amy was in). It has nothing to do with a quantum lock.

7. The angels in Blink remove someone from the time stream just by touching them, yet the angels are perfectly capable of breaking necks and grabbing Father Octavian. Another glaring inconsistency. 

7A. The Angels need enough energy to initially send someone back in time through which the angel gains a surplus of energy. however the Angels in Flesh and Stone were still very weak as they had been in stasis until just before the events of the episode happened. It is also note worthy that Angels would have the option to send what they touch back in time as we saw in blink, they touched the TARDIS but did not send it back in time.

        While I am tired I am also fairly sure that my arguments are sound. Cheers,
RenewableTruth

Rumors abound that we tried to sign David Silva for 15 million, but the previous owners wouldn't sanction the funds. 

Could you imagine what he would be producing for us now?

Other thing I don't quite agree with was Rafa selling Keane right away. Granted, we pretty much got our money back on him, but even the thought that in our time of need he could have come on and scored one of those ""right place right time"" type of goals surely would have been worth keeping him until the summer right?

On the other hand, if we were indeed going to wait until summer to sell him, he would've been harder to sell, and I'm sure Rafa wanted those transfer funds pretty badly considering the amount of shit the owners were giving him about money.

Such a frustrating time for us. We won't be back up there among the elite like that for another 2-3 years I'm thinking. Unless our team starts gelling quicker than previously indicated.

That previous midfield in particular was arguably the best in the world at that point. Masch wins the ball and gives it to Alonso. Alonso sprays the ball out wide or to Gerrard, and Gerrard feeds the ball to Torres who scores. 

With Carra and Reina, that was a total of 6 WORLD CLASS players playing for us at the same time. Carra now being out of his prime can be excluded from such, but now we've got 2 maybe 3 if you include Suarez.

The surface impression is that he's the goofy fun-loving absentminded professor, but below that there's a *lot* of dark shit going on, a lot more than with 10. In fact, I'd say that 11 is driven a lot by guilt in the current series... and while the speech he gives in the second to last ep in S5 was pretty badass, it's also another case of the Doctor's hubris, like in Waters of Mars. 

What happens when he tries to alter the fixed point seemed to really knock 10 down a peg and shake his self-confidence, which was a good thing that needed to happen. When 11 has these moments it doesn't seem to do that to him at all. We see him feeling guilt and even self-loathing, but in the end, it doesn't seem to humble him at all.

11 sort of seems like he's spiraling dangerously out of control, which I think has been an underlying theme to this current season. There's River's speech in AGMGTW where she says that cultures have used the term 'doctor' to mean 'great warrior' and Rory's anger at him in TGWW at the way he haphazardly travels and causes danger wherever he goes. I think that not only is the Doctor going out of control, but he *knows* he is, and is becoming afraid of what he is turning into. 

I think his breaking Amy's faith in him was another attempt to do damage control, to fix the shit he's fucked up. But I *definitely* do not think that it makes him the most heroic iteration of the Doctor we've seen so far.

The reason it's less damaging for the flowers is similar. Not all flowers will grow in a typical British climate and to grow them here requires you put them in greenhouses. It turns out that the energy used to heat the greenhouses for several months is more than the energy required to ship them from a hotter country.

Also factory produced feed requires fertilizers to keep growing it in the quantities required.

true,danstu,tardis,TARDIS,"The thing that really sold me on it is the wide-eyed glee it approaches its mythology with. It's the type of sci-fi show that's less concerned with explaining how every thing works and more concerned with just pointing out how cool its take on the universe is. It's not at all uncommon for the Doctor to spend a good couple of minutes cooing over how gorgeous the monster of the week when he first encounters him. He almost makes me think of Carl Sagan sometimes, that same unfaltering love of the universe and all its mysteries. There's so many sci-fi franchises out there these days trying to bit gritty and violent, I think it's refreshing to see a show that would rather have some fun with itself.

It's the type of show that is aggressively optimistic about the potential of things, even when the reality of them doesn't match it. Sometimes events let the Doctor down, and often he can't save everyone, but as a character, he never gives up on the idea that life is inherently good. There are some very dark episodes, make no mistake, but they only serve to make it all the more satisfying on the occasions where everything goes right. Watch the two part episode ""The Empty Child / The Doctor Dances"" for a perfect example.

On a simpler level, it's just a fun adventure series. Very quick, witty character dialogues, very British humor, and a universe filled to the brim with unique and interesting forms of life.

Honestly, I'll freely say it's not for everyone. The special effects can be atrocious at times, and the Doctor is VERY quirky, which I could see getting annoying to people, but I think it's one of those shows that even if it's not for you, anyone with an interest in sci-fi should at least make themselves aware of it.

**Acting**.  Those rich, deep, multifaceted characters are brought to life by very talented actors.

It can be an acquired taste, at first, especially if you start watching with the first season (post reboot) which suffers a bit from both pretty bad production values and some pretty iffy writing (both of which steadily improve as the show goes on).  But once you've given it a chance, it's easy to see why it's so popular.

It's a show based on a winning formula.  It's incredibly creative and inventive. It's centered around a very likable and engaging main character, and the ""all of time and space"" premise helps ensure that plots continue to feel fresh, for the most part, even after almost 50 years.  For that matter, the fact that they bring in new actors to play the Doctor every once in a while also helps keep things fresh, since the show kind of ends up re-inventing itself every few years as a result.

It's a swashbuckling adventure show one minute, a screwball comedy the next, and a compelling drama the next.  And yet its flexibility rarely ever seems to lead to tonal shifts that feel jarring or unnatural. 

But, in the end, why should you watch Doctor Who?  Because it is, bar none, the best science fiction show currently on television, and inarguably one of the greatest and most influential of all time.  It's a great show.  Isn't that reason enough?

If he doesn't we're soon going to have more problems with Kranjcar, Dos Santos, Pavlyuchenko and Bassong, and it won't be long before we can add Corluka, Pienaar and Huddlestone to that list.

Maybe you're right though, and we're at at stage where it would be best to keep the things that are working working, and save the rotation for a month or so down the road when we have a little more momentum.

Apparently Gallas is targeting the Arsenal match for a come back, so it might be that he doesn't feature against Wigan, at least not as a starter (he's quality, but I'd really like him to get some game time before being thrown into a high tension derby).

I would be very surprised if King doesn't start, and I don't have any problem with that. We can't go through this season coddling him and keeping him back for the good games.

true,[deleted],null,null,"I agree it's performance-based, but 'bonus' and 'commisison' are not the same thing.

&gt;**Bonus Plans**

&gt;With a bonus plan, each salesperson is typically given a quota for a territory, and incentive payments are tied to performance relative to defined quota gates, targets or thresholds. For example, the salesperson might receive a first bonus payment at 90% of quota, a second payment at 100% attainment, and a third at 110%. Bonus plans typically include a sizeable salary component, so that if salespeople do not sell enough to earn the bonus, they can still earn a decent living.

&gt;Because most bonus plans have a large salary component, such plans are often attractive to salespeople with a longer-term focus who want to stay with a firm and build a career. They also attract salespeople who in addition to selling, are interested in problem solving, consulting and servicing customers.

&gt;**Commission Plans**

&gt;Commission plans pay continuously for every sale. A commission rate is multiplied by a performance measure, such as sales or gross profits, to determine payout. Sometimes the commission rate varies by product or customer. Often, the rate varies depending upon the level of performance attained by the salesperson. For example, a salesperson might earn 3% on sales up to a territory goal and 5% on sales beyond the goal. Many commission plans include a salary component, but usually the variable component is larger than it is in a bonus plan. With most commission plans, a salesperson relies on commission earnings, in addition to salary, as an important part of income.

&gt;Commission plans that pay mostly variable pay with little or no salary tend to attract result-oriented salespeople who believe they can sell anything to anyone. Such plans also encourage poor performers to leave the firm, as they will not make enough money to earn a decent living. However, sometimes such plans generate little firm loyalty from salespeople. A salesperson paid mostly on commission is likely to jump ship if a competitor makes a better offer, and may take many of the firm’s customers.

In some tax codes, they're even taxed differently (though not in the UK). 

I don't know how much difference it makes to the sales force--sales managers claim it matters hugely as to the type of selling technique customers will encounter.  Sales people on commission are often paid minimum wage (or lower where the law allows it) with commission forming an essential part of their earnings whereas a bonus is not figured to be a part of base pay.

I also have nothing against people being paid for raising funds for charity.  I too wish they were volunteers, but it looks like this is the minimum it takes to get people out on the street for eight hours a day actively soliciting donations.

It will be interesting to see what Harry does considering the 120 minutes played at Stoke, but I think we can expect King to play for sure, and rested mid-week at the Lane. This could be a match where we see Harry's real plan for defence come to fruition, as with a European game during the week, we can expect his first choices to play today, with the secondary choices starting in Europe. I'm hoping that due to his recent form, Kaboul will be rewarded with a start today.

The main question for me is whether Krancjar or VDV will start. Something tells me VDV will be favoured, with Harry relying on Walker to control the entire right flank (i've seen him do this multiple times with Corluka in the past). I'm not a fan of this, as I'd like Walker to have the confidence to get forward a lot with someone ahead of him who can drop back when needed (you won't see VDV doing this).

We should cut the cost to the police and legal services of keeping cannabis criminalised, that should prevent some people losing their job .

Also you may be able to get joe public to support the action if it might save their jobs - it might help people to re-access the importance of keeping it illegal in the first place.)

How about - Legalise cannabis, Save police jobs !

It would cut the link to crime that the majority of otherwise law abiding criminals have - I do not break the law at all except the cannabis law (almost daily) 

One other issue that never gets mentioned is the contamination of cannabis -  which is poisoning the very children the government always claim to want to protect when they remove our civil liberties. (the reclassification was done to 'protect the kids..'

The max sentence for growing cannabis is 14 fucking years - It is morally insane that **MY** tax money goes to arrest people like me - who do no harm to society in any way.

- I would prefer if the money I spent on cannabis went to the country through tax  (which desperately needs it) rather than to scum

- decriminalisation would improve relations and trust between youth and police (some may say this is semi urgent now...)

- As I have a job (and have had for over 10 years) I pay my own way (and taxes)  - if I were to be jailed for cannabis the tax payer would be paying for my stay at 'her majesty's pleasure' - is that what tax payers want - do you want to pay for my food and rent???

true,busstopboxer,null,null,"People underrate VdV's work rate - he's not the best ball winner, but he puts himself about plenty, though you're right that he's never going to be covering his full back very well. Been a lot of discussion about leaving him out - nobody seems to have noticed it was him who played Defoe through for the all important second goal against Liverpool. Kranjcar's been great, but he's been getting plenty of minutes so far and doesn't work any harder, so I'd plump for VdV on the right this time out

I'm not necessarily endorsing the change above, with Modric moving wide, certainly not as a permanent change, though it was only at the end of the 09-10 season that he last played there. The reason I wouldn't be surprised if it happened is that Redknapp has outright said he plans to do it - following Parker's debut against Wolves he was interviewed after the match and said he was looking forward to the strength of our midfield with Parker alongside the soon to return Sandro - he specifically said Modric can play somewhere else.

I think playing this way could be a good alternative to our first choice XI, especially playing against a team that will come at us and allow us to break quickly. But as I've said elsewhere, I too would probably prefer if we kept things consistent for a little while, at least until we build a bit more momentum.

edit: Redknapp quote following Wolves match: 

&gt;""When I get Sandro back with Scott Parker in the middle of the park, we're going to be very strong,"" he said. ""Luka can play elsewhere, he can play differently but you'd have two very strong midfield players there that would make us very difficult to beat.""

That was from the Guardian if I remember correctly.

Delivering services for disabled people costs more than lobbying for human rights etc. Other charities will raise cash for research for facilities or even new offices so it can be quite hard work to really know where any donations will end up. 

It is important to note that any charitable donations can be restricted by the donor for exclusive use in a particular area. If you only want your cash to pay for hay for donkeys you can do that, although this may mean that your money isn't able to be used in the way that the charity feels will benefit it the most. Sometimes restricted donations can sit dormant for years, especially if the service no longer exists. 

Some people don't like charities having fundraising departments as they use donations to theoretically raise more cash rather than spend directly on their services. But that, in my view, is a little short sighted. 

For me, one of the most important aspects is the amount of money a charity keeps in reserves. Some charities have millions in the bank yet continue to aggressively fundraise and effectively taking away cash from other charities more in need. 

The charity commisions website is the best you can do but there isn't an a publicly accessible analysis tool available for UK charities, that i'm aware of anyway. Annual guides are available if you're willing to pay. The U.S has a good one, which I now can't find, but stumbled across this, no idea if it is any good - http://www.whichcharity.org/

I also read of a research group who wanted to use MDMA to treat depressives/bipolars but had to stop the research as it was a controlled substance and wasn't worth the trouble - they then switched to an analogue only for it to be deemed a 'legal high' and targeted for regulation so they just stopped completely.

There is no reason that drugs cannot be improved such that we have more of the positive effects and less of the negative side effects until it just becomes another effective tool we can use to exceed our basic potential like computers. 

The law as it stands is not only impractical and costly, but actively impedes scientific and technological progress. Drugs should be in the hands of professional chemists not criminals.

Evil scumbags, it's all about your perspective. As an anarchist leaning techno hippy who hates the idea of work I don't really welcome profits full stop. The big problem I have with them is that they are duplicitous and don't disclose what is actually going to happen to your money. They will harrass people with little money, pressing on them the difference £2 a week could make and they may sign up despite the fact they might not be able to afford it. If they were forced to disclose that your first 18 months of payments will go to charity rapists PLC rather than cancer babies you know that nobody would donate, and if they did still they would just do it directly. 

At the end of the day a lot of charities do a lot of awesome work that wouldn't happen without fundraising one way or another. Should a charity accept donations from dubious characters if it helps them to fulfil their objectives?

true,strolls,null,null,"15 years ago White Stuff and Fat Face were very similar - they each had stores in a number of the French ski resorts and a handful in trendy West London, too.

They made some *really nice* clothes that were pretty much unique - things like wooden or stone buttons or a really unusual cut / material. My girlfriend at the time had a Fat Face collared sweatshirt with a wooden duffle button at the neck.

In particular they did some awesome rugby (or ""crew"") shirts made out of denim, basically. The thickness of the material really showed where they doubled-it up at collars and cuffs - it made for really hard-wearing rugged casual shirts.

I still have 3 of these shirts (Fat Face - I think I must have just missed some of the best White Stuff stuff, because older buddies of mine wore some of theirs) that are over 10 years old, and I still wear them. At the time this particular design was a regular part of their range, and it came out in slightly different colour combinations each year (autumn season, I think). I usually tried to catch them in the sales, but with hindsight I wish I'd bought more of them. They are remarkably durable garments and I like the style (IMO it's timeless). I've also got two Fat Face fleeces that age which are basically too thick to wear outside of the dead of winter.

Quality went down, IMO, with their expansion from a hip London niche into a nationwide chain. 

White Stuff is a reference to skiing, by the way - I think they were originally the ""Boys from the White Stuff"" and they had a t-shirt that with that slogan and a graphic that showed [cascades of snow being thrown up behind the skier](http://i.imgur.com/0InP3.jpg).

Personally I believe that in the UK we are significantly more risk averse than is sensible, horrible though it sounds a few children being killed or worse is a small price to pay for a society where the average child gets to play outdoors and have male adults interact with them and be friendly. And this is taking the fairly big leap that our current policies are even sane, the majority of abuse as I understand it is carried out by close family members, having children isolated from non-family adults increases the danger to them. 


People are terrible at evaluating risk, which is why insurance companies make so much money, they focus on the risks highlighted by newspapers and ignore the much more common but less sensational, terrorism is less of an issue than speeding, so are predatory child molesters.

Also those drugs are largely used because the drugs they somewhat imitate, namely cocaine and amphetamines are not available. If cocaine and amphetamines were available in safe qualities with a reasonable level of taxation as with every luxury then I honestly believe it would wipe out a major source of gang crime and allow the beneficial effects of those drugs to be properly investigated. (There is a reason that businessmen etc. take them, one of the greatest and most prolific mathematicians ever, Paul Erdos, was an amphetamine user).

Our current 'ban everything' approach just doesn't work. It really is a ban everything approach as well, alcohol and tobacco are only legal because prohibition failed miserably, just as the drug war has.
