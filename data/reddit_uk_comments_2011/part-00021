While I'm on the topic, as an American, it bothers me that soccer players get injured so much (especially problem players like Aurelio and Agger).  How is it that NFL players can run into each other at full speed every week and stay healthy the whole year, but Fabio Aurelio can't go 45 minutes without pulling his hamstring?  Do football clubs really suck at medicine and athletic training?  I know the NFL uses state-of-the-art everything with regard to training techniques and stuff, and I also know that having more muscle (which American football players generally will always have more because the nature of the game) helps prevent injury to a certain extent, but this seriously bugs me.

I actually didn't give a shit about the royal wedding and out right refused to watch any of it (although the I caught a glimpse of Kate's sister in the news, damn she is fine!).

Fair enough it's not an opinion, but it's still satirised based on your own personal bias.

I'm also sure that Raddie would say that they had only peaceful intentions, but think about it, they were going to mock **execute** a royal. Peaceful &amp; execute don't fit into the same game never mind the same ball park. If they're against the royal family, fair enough, but the intention to have a protest against them yesterday was intended to cause an insult and my overriding morals tell me that there's a time and a place for those insults, and just under death in the family is such a special occasion as a wedding.

And the thing about our taxes paying for the royal wedding, there was no increased money from the govt to pay for the wedding so the royals had this money already &amp; then it brings about the argument of the money that the Royals actually generate for the British Govt with tourism and the like.",0,1304157870,null,0,false,0,c1rpxsv,t3_gzt3t,t1_c1rpxsv,t1_c1rkke3,1427106727,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

true,DaveLambert,tardis,TARDIS,"&gt;Can anyone explain the scene in the bar with Jack at the end? He didn't seem to recognize The Doctor. And the guy Jack talked to looked familiar.

If you had watched Torchwood, especially the 3rd Series (""Children of Earth""), you'll learn that Captain Jack felt guilty for things he had done, both in the recent past and distant past, in the name of trying to keep the Earth safe. He's sort-of exiled himself from Earth for a bit as of the end of that story arc, trying to work things out in his head.

When 10/Tennant was going to go, RTD wanted him to visit all of his companions at the end, as you saw.  So The Doctor had to go find Jack at an alien bar ""drowning his sorrows"" in order to make that particular visit happen.  And, as you saw, The Doctor was not MERELY visiting each companion, but (with the exception of his visit to a pre-""9"" Rose) he was actively doing something to help them.  What could the Doctor do to help Jack?  Cheer him up?  Okay, let's hook him up.

Regardless of RTD's (or anyone else's) behind-the-scenes reasons for choosing to hook Jack up with this particular person (as noted by others in this thread), it makes sense for the 10th Doctor's *Titanic* adventure to be acknowledged if possible, as it was a rather popular Christmas special.  Kylie Minogue's ""Astrid"" from ""Voyage of the Damned"" wouldn't be available to cheer Jack up, as anyone who saw that episode would know.  But since Jack is ""omnisexual"", and since 10 made a big deal out of wanting to say ""*allons-y* Alonso"" ever since ""Army of Ghosts"" and finally got to do it in ""Voyage of the Damned"", then why not bring back Midshipman Alonso Frame and use him to cheer up Jack?  'Twas very cool with me to do so.

And of course Jack recognized the Doctor; he's just down in the dumps at the moment and didn't particularly want to see old friends at that point in time.  We've all been there.  Hopefully Alonso's sexual healing with Jack is enough to start Capt. Harkness on the road to recovery, because we'll be needing him in Torchwood's 4th Series (""Miracle Day"")!",0,1304165477,null,0,false,0,c1rq4id,t3_h0rha,t1_c1rq4id,t3_h0rha,1427106810,4,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,4

A further ten percent of the country are rabid pro-royalists. They buy collectors plates, and souvenir mugs, they cue for hours at royal occasions and wave plastic union flags. They believe the royal family embodies all that is good and great about Britain.

The remaining eighty per cent really don't give a flying fuck one way or the other. They might remark somewhat bitterly that William seems to have bought a very nice car with our tax money, but they also think all the pomp and ceremony looks quite nice.

And really, even if you do dislike the idea of inherited political power, would you genuinely want to go through with a huge barrage of constitutional reforms? Creating an elected head of state, abolishing the house of lords and dis-establishing the church of England might sound great, but is it really what you want the government concentrating on right at this minute?

b) They wouldn't. 

c) I don't follow. AFAIK and have experienced, the police are 'scripted' to uphold the law. The fact law makers are politically motivated is, IMO, a good reason to have a position of power outside (as far as is possible in reality) of the political process. i.e. A monarchy.

d) The Political Class is a very good point you raise, but as this is about the Monarchy, I don't see it being relevant. As for the 'plutocratic' class, again this isn't linked to Monarchy in this context. Apologies if I have misunderstood you.

e) The fact it is a state occasion, doesn't, IMO, make it a platform for protest. Being funded by tax payers is a disingenious idea. We pay the wages of politicians, does that give us the right to protest at their weddings? I don't think so.

The fact is, this country is open to free speech and protest, very open to our credit, and it is this extreme openness which is the problem here I feel.

true,emmster,eccleston,Eccleston,"&gt;Davies introduced us to a mainstream SciFi world in which sexuality was fluid and characters identified across the spectrum. In Davies’ Whoniverse, characters who had picked a team were still at ease switch hitting or at least flirting with the idea. It made the series hot without resorting to typical sexist and otherizing gazes that permeate Moffat’s world.

I'll agree wholeheartedly that was one of Davies' strengths, making sexual orientation appear to be a non-issue in the future, as well as race, gender, etc. I liked pretending to live in that world for an hour at a time, too. That was a very special thing to a lot of people. 

But, at the same time, I don't think Moffat's doing such a bad job at maintaining that legacy in his own way. Rory's discomfort with naked stranger ass seems perfectly consistent with a contemporary character. And while the lingering shot of Amy's legs may have been a little annoying, at least to me, it felt more like a big clue by four that her police uniform was not exactly standard issue. 

And Fish Custard was funny. You can't get through that scene without cracking a smile unless you're just determined not to like it. ",0,1304183480,null,0,false,0,c1rqzii,t3_h0t7h,t1_c1rqzii,t3_h0t7h,1427107215,2,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,2

So, to recap A LOT of plotpoints.
(There's a ""SPOILERS!"" in the title, so excuse me while I don't black mark it out)

Amy is pregnant:

* ... AND yet she isn't. Only the doctor knows her unborn baby is in a state of flux.
* There were pictures of Amy and her baby in the old house. Where are they from? How did they get in the 60s?

The space suit monster:

* The space suit probably is the monster that was trying to ""eat"" the girl, and it succeeded. She got stuck in it.
* Who was in the space suit back in 2011, because the little girl escaped out of it back in the 60s.
* Did the Doctor leave the suit behind, knowing it could be dangerous?

The little girl in the suit:

* The little girl in the 60s spacesuit is a time lord. We saw her regenerate on screen.
* What was she dying of?
* She is, according to the Doctor, immensely strong as she was able to escape the suit on her own.
* Is it the lovechild of Amy and the Doctor? The doctor already has a regeneration-enabled daughter, does it have something to do with that?

Amy:

* If it is the child of Amy and the Doctor: how did it end up there? Did Amy end up there, too? Is it Amy in the suit back in 2011?
* How much time did Amy spend with the Silence?
* Who was the lady with the eyepatch?

The Silence:

* The freaky ""TARDIS of Death"" of yesterseason is a Silence ship. As the Doctor wondered ""How did that get empty?"" (Edit: if it really was empty)

River:

* They're not just randomly meeting, it is practically sure that they're meeting in reverse order. (Doesn't that make the ""syncing the diaries"" bit useless?)

TIMELORD! YES! It must be that the spacesuit was capable of raising the time baby. Who's is it? Could it still be river song herself? She could be a time lady that just couldn't regenerate after the library due to the force of the death. 

Rory being stupid face. Much better than having an angst filled season. Get that love out there and out of the way right away.

The pregnant/not pregnant spinning between. Was that a cliffhanger or was the TARDIS actually saying she's both pregnant and not at the same time? There's no way that if she is pregnant that anything bad is going to happen to this baby so could the Silence have done something to her while she was captive? Doubt it's that, it's a kids show and raping her isn't exactly PG material. 

So who is this child then!? Exciting!

Ok first the critique. What happened to the silence? Yes everyone could see them and were programmed to kill but then what? Did we burn the bodies? Forget about them? What did we do!?!?

TIMELORD! YES! It must be that the spacesuit was capable of raising the time baby. Who's is it? Could it still be river song herself? She could be a time lady that just couldn't regenerate after the library due to the force of the death. Or is it Jenny?

Rory being stupid face. Much better than having an angst filled season. Get that love out there and out of the way right away.

The pregnant/not pregnant spinning between. Was that a cliffhanger or was the TARDIS actually saying she's both pregnant and not at the same time? There's no way that if she is pregnant that anything bad is going to happen to this baby so could the Silence have done something to her while she was captive? Doubt it's that, it's a kids show and raping her isn't exactly PG material.

So who is this child then!? Exciting!

So The silence make Amy (and possibly River) pregnant, hence the sickness, because they know it will create a weird Timelord / Human hybrid, possibly something done by the TARDIS or just somehow because of the temporal energy. They do this because they are looking for a pilot for their home made TARDIS as seen in The Lodger, possibly for an invasion, possibly to leave. The Doctor is too powerful, he stated himself that if it used him he the whole solar system would explode.

The girl is the Timelord / Human hybrid and quite possibly Rory is not the father, possibly the baby was created by The Silence using The Doctor's DNA somehow? Remember The Doctor's Daughter, Jenny?

I haven't seen the latest episode, but based on *The Impossible Astronaut*, we don't know the MO of the Silents. Their agenda is an unquantifiable value.

The green death - really? You don't think Batman could handle giant slugs and a 1970s supercomputer? Are you possibly thinking of the Adam West version of Batman? Because otherwise, Batman would have this one sewn up in about half the time it took the Doctor.

The Sontarans - I can see some scenarios in which Batman would actually *ally* himself with the Sontarans. Remember that their primary mission is to assure victory against the Rutans. Everything else is peripheral to that.

The Judoon - They're not even bad guys. They're a mercenary police force. Their only objection to Batman might be a directive against vigilantism.

also, amy and the doctor had sex, and she is in love with him, we witness her declaration of love over the transmitter. in the other timeline she still loves rory. amy has always been good at explaining away stuff for herself and others.

Up until the last ten minutes or so of last season, we have *one* timestream, but when the Doctor does his thing by flying the Pandorica into the heart of the exploding TARDIS, he gets wiped from history. He never was. The whole series never happened. Not just the season. Not just since the 2005 retcon, but all the past 31 seasons, all eleven Doctors. Never existed.

So, we now have two timelines.

One - We've been watching this for the past 48 years, with the Doctor. This timeline ends when the Doctor flies into the exploding TARDIS.

Two - The new timeline, with no Doctor, no Robot Rory. Cracks never happened. Amy's parents exist, and she and Rory get married. This is the timeline we should be experiencing now.

However, Amy then calls back the Doctor from memory (as the cracks take time to close), thus creating the paradox of two timelines mixing and in flux? One timeline where Amy and Rory get married (and have a baby?) and there never was a Doctor, and the shouldn't-exist Doctor entering from the previous timeline?

This also fits with ""the greatest man I ever knew"" - because it isn't the Doctor (which, in my opinion, has been a giant red herring this whole time), but something she thinks even more highly of.

As for the child, it's Susan, the Doctor's grand-daughter (from way back). She was kidnapped by the Silence because of her potential ability to fly their machine.

We're a minority here, probably even in our own subreddit. Much like /r/christianity will have a lot more atheists reading it than christians.  

Personally, none of my friends use reddit, even as much as I've told them about it. They look at it as a pointless thing to be a part of. Even though you see interesting things, life hacks, and hawt pr0n... They just aren't interested in it. 

Americans who look @ this site may be able to relate to it more, due to the cultural differences, as slight as they may be. The Americans probably still have a stronger vote in this subreddit, and could be submitting here more so than people from the united kingdom, too. 

Sure, the British are a lot more reserved than many other nations.

Angels only exist when you look at them. Say a Silence looks at an Angel: the statue is there, but they don't exist, technically. As soon as the Silence looks away the Angel can see him...but when the Silence turns back, the Angel doesn't exist anymore. So since it doesn't exist, it's not looking at the Silence - so it forgets about the Silence. Every time the Silence looks away, the Angel cannot remember the Silence at all. They're perfectly safe from Angels.

[citation needed]

Structured overlay p2p networks are pretty solid. Kademlia has been observed to behave very robustly, even when under substantial churn. 

&gt; (…) and is a good way to for lots of data corruption

That's nonsense. 

1. Torrent uses DHT only to store information about seeders. It's something like:

        ( key → value ) = ( &lt;sha1sum of torrent's content&gt; → &lt;ip+port&gt; )

    In that regard it's exactly what tracker normally does and nothing beyond that. 

2. All .torrent files contain list of chunks with their respective hashes. DHT-based peer discovery does not impact this in any way. 

3. Only two transport protocols are used for file transmission (TCP &amp; uTP) and both validate transmissions for any corruptions. 

**An idea** Instead of hosting it 100% on your servers, why not create a Torrent/Magnet with *webseeds*? That way early downloaders can be super-seeded very fast and swarm can be sustained healthy. It should lower your bandwidth use 50-80%, while still offering great download experience. It's just crazy that this is essentially *the* use-case for bittorrent (many people downloading at the same time) and you guys are using exclusively third-party for content delivery.

It's above an old club that has shut down. It has cracked windows with binbags put over them, and that doesn't really keep the cold out when you're training in the winter. But cold weather is good for the immune system. But on the coldest of days, every jab is more painful because of the cold leather hitting you... Colder skin probably bleeds easier, I'm not sure about the science of it. It does feel a lot rougher in the gym though when it's fucking -degrees outside. However, fighting back in these conditions is something you can never underestimate. Given the fact that the ropes have had the plastic rip off them (but not fully - and some parts of them are sharp), so if you lean into the ropes it digs into your back, it's more incentive to box harder. 

You Americans who think the British youth are angry should honestly fly over and go a few rounds with me in the gym. You'd learn a lot about will, staying power, and stamina. You'd also be outnumbered, as we are here... only in a different environment. It would work wonders for your soul.

You could come back to my house afterwards, have some cups of tea, debate our cultural differences and talk philosophy, before going to the pub.

I'm pretty sure I remember it being said more than once he cannot go back and undo things that would prevent a meeting or situation the Doctor himself was involved in to not occur. I believe he gets stuck in the timeline in a way where he is incapable of changing anything that has already happened in part of a timeline he has joined in a significant way.

So, upon meeting Batman it should be impossible for the Doctor to go back and prevent Bruce from becoming Batman (or existing for that matter).

Furthermore, if were assuming their worlds collide or they always existed in the same universe or even The Doctor pops into Batman's reality we have to concede the possibility that Batman has fixed points of time in his life, and the Doctor can't change fixed points in any significant way (Water of mars). Batman is ridiculously important to Gotham and therefore millions of people not to mention how important he is as Bruce Wayne. He has encountered even more influential people and impacted their lives (likelihood of fixed points increasing and increasing) and gone on to things like the justice league. He also has gone into different realities(I remember him meeting another Batman) so he might have timeline-protection from having hopped the dimensional border. 

I'm convinced that it would be impossible for the Doctor to go back and unmake the Batman having after meeting him for one if not all of the above reasons. It certainly isn't a guarantee that he could. We need some Doctor Who scholar for that one. 

Edit: In case someone is going to point out he time traveled and effected the current timeline in Christmas Carol, he went forward there- he didn't go back and prevent something that already happened from happening.

I have so many questions from this episode. I imagine there was a point in the Doctor's future (and River's past) that it was made known that the first time he ever kissed her was the last time she kissed him. The Library may be coming soon for her... This is all speculation based off her expression. 

I believe the child is Amy's. We know the Doctor eventually finds out he is going to die, and how. My guess is that he requests that Amy be a surrogate mother for his offspring. **Sidenote:** Something that plays into this that I'm unsure of is Rory. Was he reconstituted back to full human form after the 2nd Big Bang? I think not, meaning he is still plastic. I seriously doubt he can have babies, thus the only way I can see him agreeing to Amy having the Doctor's baby... Then again, Amy could over rule him at any moment if he disagreed. 

The astronaut suit is made by the Doctor to help his daughter survive until she can grow up and control her regenerative abilities properly. Thus her ditching it at the end of Day of the Moon. 

Why would she kill the Doctor, though? And why is she not with Amy when she is a small child? And it seems that she is traveling without a TARDIS... The only explanation I can think of is that the Doctor built some basic time traveling mechanism into the suit...

River is becoming a tragic character. The ""there's a last time for everything"" scene was heart rending. Nice acting Alex.

The Silent TARDIS in the lodger. The Doctor described this as abandoned and said ""I wonder why?"" I take this to be sarcasm, he knew that it was abandoned because he defeated them in 1969. How many of these ships are there though?

The spacesuit hacking the phone system was a total ripoff of the Omnicom from The Empty  Child. I'm not complaining but it was.

How did she break out? Time Lords aren't known for their superhuman strength.

Did anyone else think she was going to eat the hobo at the end, shortly before the regeneration scene? Did anyone else think ""The Rani!""?

That's an interesting idea. I think she really is pregnant - I don't think they'd bring that whole concept up randomly if it wasn't really going to play into the story. But I also think you're probably onto something. Steven Moffat doesn't seem to do anything small. If they're going to make Amy really pregnant, it's probably because they want to explore crazy ideas of what having a baby would mean to time travelers. Or what a child being raised as a time traveler would be like. [\*cough\*River?\*cough\*](/spoiler)

My take on what EvilDrReef said (and to answer your original question) - the Silence in the bathroom told her she needed to ""tell the Doctor what he must know, and what he must never know."" That seemed to plant an idea in her mind, so even though she forgot seeing the Silence, the feeling that she had something she needed to tell the Doctor grew throughout the episode, until the suggestion caught up with her and she realized that she absolutely had to tell him even though she didn't know why. At least, that was the impression I had. I don't think it was anything about that moment that made her have to tell him then - it was so random how she even ignored what was happening around them, it seemed like she was subconsciously compelled to reveal it based on the Silence's suggestion.",0,1304202816,null,0,false,0,c1rsbq1,t3_gys6y,t1_c1rsbq1,t1_c1raq1h,1427107848,2,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,2

The silence are building a Tardis. Or they have someone building it for them (the Master? That seems like the sort of thing he'd do.) However they got it, they have time travel technology, and therefore have the ability to create paradoxes (I'm under the impression that the other species can't, if only because the Daleks would have no compunctions about going back in time and wiping out each species one by one at their planets birth, whereas the Timelords were dead set against actually changing the flow of time).

Therefore, if they're responsible for the baby Amy is only pregnant if they succeed, which is in flux. The doctor is only able to survive if they're stopped as well, which is how they'll be able to get around that whole ""killed forever"" thing that happened last episode.

Did anyone else find it confusing how the markings (tallies) were on their faces too? If they were doing it themselves to keep an actual tally, you would expect them to do it neatly along their arms for easier counting in the future -- definitely not on their faces. Even when we knew they were writing on themselves, the way they were scrawled all over the body still confused me.  
  
I also didn't really get how they were able to remember what they were doing. I mean, they forget the Silence exist as soon as they look away, but they still knew that they were on a mission to defeat them (or something). When they tested the FBI agent inside the tardis using the hologram, why was it only the FBI agent who forgot? Once the hologram disappeared surely they should have *all* forgot?  
  
~~I was expecting the picture Amy took on her phone in the first episode to come into play with her remembering them, but we never saw it again.~~  
  
I loved how Weeping Angel-esque the scene where the Silence had Amy prisoner was. When they had to keep staring at them, I wasn't sure about the ""rules"" here though; I mean, they weren't actually constantly looking at every Silence (I think there was one point where they all had their backs to the one near Amy), so shouldn't they have forgotten about one as soon as they looked away from it and therefore not looked towards it again? Not to mention, why didn't any of Silence use their power?
  
Regardless of all that, the episode itself was still awesome. I just wish it had ended with the cliffhanger of Amy's potential pregnancy though, rather than that weird/pointless scene with the girl (why did she come out of her hiding place to talk to the homeless guy, only to do her weird energy thing?).  
  
The scene with River and The Doctor after they kiss nearly made me cry! Anyway, I think I'm done poking holes in it now. Awesome episode was awesome.

[This article](http://www.comicsalliance.com/2011/04/29/ask-chris-54-the-mythology-of-jack-kirbys-new-gods/) is a very good analysis of Darkseid, and the other New Gods.

In a sense, Darkseid is *crime itself.*  The other important takeaway is that good is stronger.  Darkseid will never be wiped out, but he will never win out, either.

The events of the fights between Batman and Darkseid aren't really important.  The simple truth is, Darkseid *can't* win against Batman.

[Look at this wanker](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bj4yn1RBxHs&amp;feature=player_detailpage#t=200s) what a fucking righteous man he is. He's obviously a modern day Malcolm X. LOL, he's so secure in what he's preaching, and standing for that he shows his face. Fuck off with your horrible extreme videos of hate. 

By saying this supports the word you tell me on reddit, you're saying you agree that we in Britain live in a 'fascist regime'. so we'll start from there.

The first link you showed me, with the fucking horrible idiots chanting that. Imagine that being shown on the news. Imagine they gathered a following of low lives, and educated people who aren't proud to be who they are, and they chanted that on the international news, DURING THE TIME WHEN OUR FUTURE KING IS GETTING MARRIED? I would have driven down there with a car full of scousers to support those police, even though they are southern faries lolz. 

If you want not be proud of britain, and think you live in a fascist regime, then so be it. 

Don't fucking talk to me about it because I'm proud of who I am, and the country I come form, even if you are some little internet rebel who supports videos uploaded by students who quite frankly, would have been supported by people like me during WW2. 

Notice how he's jumping around trying to exercise his rights by focusing on the numbers of the police there. LOL OMG, I would have just punched him in the face and taken the camera. I would have done this after he harassed police and I found him at a time where I could have taken this action. I mean seriously, if you're English and are posting this shit, I doubt you'd voice your opinion in the local pub.. Even if you're from down South you'd get your face smashed into the floor.
