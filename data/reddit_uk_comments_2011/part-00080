true,etari,tennant,Tennant,"Not everyone has an iPhone, many people do, but not everyone does. The problem is that there are only a few iPhones which have cases that can work for several versions of them. Then take Android, there are dosens of android devises which all have unique sizes and shapes. That's the real problem, each individual phone version way undersells each iPhone version. So that means way less sales for cases for specific droid phones, so companies that make cases don't put as much effort into those.

Here are 4 articles from this year that say that more people have android phones then iPhones:

[Android Saw Twice As Many Buyers As iPhone Over The Past 3 Months](http://techcrunch.com/2011/09/26/android-vs-iphone-sales/)

I don't like to stereotype but I also came across some articles based on statistics of who buys the phones, and iPhones are much more likely to be purchased by women, who are more likely to buy a fancy case. Men are more likely to go with a plain case or no case. And cases seem to be a lot more important to the iPhone user base then Android users, I don't know why, probably good marketing.

&gt;I tend not to like people of African origin - they are generally disagreeable.

You've changed the whole sentence completely, sure the opinions *behind* them remain the same but they are not equivalents.  For something to be considered abuse it doesn't have to involve swearing or be targeted at a person, *both* of those sentences fall under any common definition of abuse.

Your argument seems to be that as long as you don't swear or direct your comment towards someone it's fine but if you do, you'll be punished.  

* i.e. You want to silence targeted opinions

I understand this, it was clear from your initial remark.  Though do please correct me if I'm wrong, of course...

&gt;Can I ask: Do you think racial slurs should be acceptable for use in public? i.e. Nigger, paki, wog etc.?

It depends what you mean by 'acceptable'  if you define it as:

&gt; able to be agreed on; suitable; adequate; satisfactory; pleasing; welcome.

Then no, it is *not* acceptable, but if you define 'acceptable' as:

&gt; able to be tolerated or allowed.

Then I do.  I believe most people are above such things and are fully capable of ostracising a person for vile behaviour.  In fact we saw a whole tram carriage of people united against her (even if most of them were silent) and upon the video being seen by thousands of people she has been nigh on unanimously condemned.  What I don't support is violent enforcement of this ostracising, whereas you do.

Richard Herring wasn't suggesting Ricky Gervais should be punished, he was expressing the opinion that it wasn't funny and he heavily implied that comedians who used such language shouldn't be supported.  In fact, if anything Herring is basically saying what I am here, nowhere does he imply violence be used  to silence the people using mong.

Here is a blurb from a [Guardian article]( http://www.guardian.co.uk/notesandqueries/query/0,5753,-2807,00.html )


&gt;Q - Why are cans of soft drink standardised at 330ml, cartons of juice 200ml and alcoholic beers and ciders 440ml? Is that as much as they think we can drink or is there some other reason?

&gt;&gt; A - DRINKS cans are now made in dozens of sizes worldwide, depending on local needs, from 150ml up to &gt;&gt;750ml. Before the second world war, beer in the US was filled in steel cans which used what had been a &gt;&gt;traditional size for canning peas. This held 12 fluid ounces of drink and the volume and diameter of the can &gt;&gt;was retained when the modern style of so-called ""two-piece"" (with a lid and a body) drinks can was &gt;&gt;introduced in the late fifties. A volume of 12oz is 355ml, and this is still the standard in the US: in Europe it &gt;&gt;was converted to the round figure of about one-third of a litre, or 330ml. Demand in Europe for bigger &gt;&gt;volumes in beer cans lead to the third larger size of 440ml and later the 500ml. Smaller sizes such as 150ml, &gt;&gt;200 and 250ml are employed for children's drinks and mixers where bigger volumes are not required. Regional &gt;&gt;traditions influence can sizes. In Venezuela, 8oz and 10oz beer and soft-drinks cans prevailed until recently &gt;&gt;because they fitted in the local cooled vending machines.*

As for the weaker beer question, it is simply due to government regulations it seems. [Here](http://www.yourdrinking.ie/reports/HPR00520.pdf) is an governmental report on drink strength in the Republic and at various points, it compares + contrasts with the UK.

So the only way I can convince you is to list every single example under the sun? You'll understand why this is the last reply you get from me? I hope that, but don't expect it.

Something for you to consider:    
Can you tell understand the difference between someone screaming ""FUCK YOU, ARSEHOLE!"" in someone's face, and     someone saying ""I don't like you."" from across a table?

&gt; I understand this, it was clear from your initial remark. Though do please correct me if I'm wrong, of course...

For the last fucking time - and I use that word for emphasis - I explained how those two parts of [that sentence](http://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/mt74i/daily_mail_berates_female_tram_racist_for/c33p3wi) were somewhat incorrectly aligned. I believe I have explained that more than once now. But seeing as you are intent upon it meaning something which I have refuted... What's the point? You're not going to listen to me, but for some reason *need* someone who does not completely agree with you to be totally wrong. *shrug* I can understand the subtleties on this issue and where I might have come across as appearing to be in favour of something I'm not. That's why I explained in the first place. So... Keep doing what you're doing, feel free to think I've scurried off because I can't face your repetitions on something I've explained - I give up trying to convince you otherwise. [But bear this in mind, now that I've decided not to play the game anymore.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=fxYXbM52wUs#t=34s)

&gt; p.s. I don't recall her using any swearing in her rant about black people not being British, she did say ""Fucking Polish"", though that wasn't directed at anyone.

You might want to listen to the video again.

&gt; [Fuck off, you ain't British: You're black. You're black. You ain't British, you're black.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=Uy8_Z5b3yBw#t=104s)

It seems there is nothing I can do or say that will make you acknowledge that I do not think that way you decided I do in the *first* comment you made to me. To be honest, that's bloody weird on your part. I wonder if I'd just have said ""No."" you would have accepted it.

So I'm out. After this, there's absolutely no reason for me to continue responding to you. Why should I, when you continually tell me you know my mind better than me, despite constant assurances and explanations to the contrary?

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt;Can you tell understand the difference between someone screaming ""FUCK YOU, ARSEHOLE!"" in someone's face, and someone saying ""I don't like you."" from across a table?

Screaming in someones face is obviously different from saying something from across the table, but that's due to the physical nature of such an act and is completely different to the situation on the tram (She was loud but in no way was she getting physically close to people, let alone their faces), yet you still want her arrested.

There's a difference between those statements yes, one includes a pejorative and the other is a statement of opinion.  The problem is the tram lady didn't use any pejoratives, she expressed opinions (immigrants are ruining Britain, they should go home and fix their own countries, black people can't be British) and used the word 'fucking' to emphasise her anger (though it was not aggression).

Maybe you are just unintentionally seeing abuse and aggression (she wasn't likely to escalate to violence and she wasn't forceful just rather loud, angry and distasteful) where there is none due to the way she expresses herself, however I think that is pretty revealing itself.

p.s.  My intention hasn't been to trap you in a game or wind you up, I just believe there is a disconnect between your apparent support of free speech and wanting this woman arrested for 'abuse/aggression'.",0,1322705475,null,0,true,0,c346fwk,t3_mt74i,t1_c346fwk,t1_c3464vy,1427954223,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

true,atheistmil,cnty-uk,United Kingdom,"My reasons for being a Eurosceptic:

1. The lack of democratic accountability of anything the EU does. MEPs are directly elected but as only 1 of 3 pillars of EU power they don't have as much sway as perhaps they should.

2. Specifically relating to the eurozone - it was doomed before it began it was always a case of ""when"" not ""if"" something bad would happen to one of the PIGS countries. This was hampered by France and Germany breaking the Stability and Growth pact.

3. Following on from above - the EU project is entirely political and for this reason far too much horse trading gets in the way of sensible decision making. E.g. Danone, maker of yoghurts is a ""strategic"" company according to France.

4. The EU as sold to the British in the 70s was that of the EFTA / EEC it was *not* what we have subsequently been drawn in to. Many of the older generations feel that politicians purposely mis-led people because they knew that a political union would have been voted against.

5. As a result of 4. we have not had a referendum on pretty significant Treaty changes which has riled a lot of people. I daresay we'd vote to stay in the EU but by not having the vote we are making people increasingly unhappy.

6. The EU constitution and Lisbon treaty debacle also shows that there is a ""political elite"" running the show with little consideration for what the people of Europe actually want.

7. The CAP. This is a disgrace.

8. In my opinion the EU is too left wing, the majority of the EU countries are not exactly free trade and this does not sit nicely with the majority of the UK.

9. While France and Germany remain allied on European issues it would be hard for any other group to push an agenda since those two countries make up a significant amount of the EU (this is also one reason why the UK has been keen on EU expansion)

When I was a kid I was very pro-American, having been there several times I still admire many things about the place but I do think we align closer with Western Europe these days. 

So I would say I am eurosceptic because it has been poorly set up and poorly thought out.

Agreed. It's *almost* as appalling as the justifications they offer for brutally lopping pieces off of their children's genitalia. I'm all for having a live-and-let-live attitude to religions, but *only* within the parameters of what is considered acceptable behaviour in our modern society. 

In my view, we should no more be allowing the ritual mutilation of children, or the barbaric methods of slaughtering animals, than allowing human sacrifices.

&gt; “Comparing John Maynard Keynes to Mr Muslim shows, in my view, why Richard Dawkins just doesn’t really get it.""

Oh hang on...

Children do not understand religion at such a young age, they cannot comprehend that which they are being given as a label. That is the very simple and obvious point that Cameron and many others refuse to acknowledge. The same way the phrase ""Lib Dem child"" is ridiculous, the same can be said of ""Christian child"" or ""Muslim child"". Considering how many adults struggle with their faith and various aspects of belief, why is it assumed that children can understand it?

&gt; “I think faith schools are very often good schools. Why? Because the organization that’s backing the school – the church or the mosque or the synagogue – is part of the community,”

Well if it's an organisation from the community he's after, then why can't the WI run a school? What about a local rotary club? Hell, the darts team from the local pub can do it!

Or is he coming from a ""Religious organisations are automatically qualified because they claim to be the moral authority"" angle? The general public would seem not to agree with him, if religious affiliation statistics are anything to go by.

What about the *majority* of children who go to those schools that *do not* take any part in church life? Two thirds of schools in the UK are faith schools. I don't think I have to make it clear to anyone that no where near two thirds of UK school children or their immediate families attend a place of worship on a regular basis. [In fact if you consider that these figures could be quite accurate, it would seem that actually something like 2/3 of the population fall into the categories of not actively religious and 
actually non-religious.](http://www.humanism.org.uk/campaigns/religion-and-belief-surveys-statistics)

&gt; He also said they bring the community together.

Only if the community are all the same religion. Those who are not religious seem to fall into the ""Sucks to be you"" category.

&gt; Moreover, he explained, institutions should be free to teach their values to children.

Yes. In church. Not in a school. Only in the last few years have parents been *legally** given the option of removing their children from regular acts of collective worship. When it comes to the general religious teaching, children do not have a choice and nor do parents. As such the kids are forced to sit through it, with often no option of another school: consider the average UK village or small town - how many schools are there usually? 

A school is automatically a place of truth and of authority. There's a reason religious people like children in their sights: Children are credulous in nature. This is why so many people 'just happen' to be the same religion as their parents.

&gt; The church was providing good schools long before the state ever got involved

Somewhat irrelevant.

&gt; we should respect the fact that it’s not just the state that can provide education – other bodies, too

Oh good! So the religious organisations can pay for those schools and the state can provide a non-religious alternative?

&gt; He has also accused religious schools of proselytizing children.

... This is to imply that that's *not* why religious organisations insist on being allowed to put their name over the gate?! Come on.

&gt; “I would never want to indoctrinate children in atheism, any more than in religion. Instead, children should be taught to ask for evidence, to be skeptical, critical, open-minded,""

That, almost that alone, is the major reason faith schools can cause problems.

The (not rare) outright refusal to teach children things they *must* know.

But here's the contradiction: If, as you say, it's true that most faith schools claim they do not *teach* their religion - that is to say they do not try and indoctrinate children - then what is the problem with removing all traces of their religion from the school? That's not to say don't or they shouldn't teach RE, as that subject is very important, but religious education is not the same as religious instruction.

If indoctrination is not the goal, then a dominant religion can go without any ill effects whatsoever.

Hello. Is it? I can't say I've ever seen it discussed before. But there again I've only recently started visiting this sub regularly. 

As for my views on circumcision: well, when it comes to *any* common human behaviour/practise I'm not sure about, I try to imagine how an explanation of it might sound to an advanced alien species. If I think they would probably view it as horrific and/or absurd, then I conclude it almost certainly *is*! I'm projecting my own sensibilities onto imaginary beings of course, but I find it helps me to clarify in my own mind whether I should be opposed to something or not.

&gt;Did you know there's a study that shows increased HIV protection for women who have been circumcised?

No. That sounds like a classic misrepresentation/misunderstanding of cause and effect when examining statistics. If sexual contact is rendered painful or not pleasurable as a result of the procedure – which, by all accounts it is – it stands to reason that women who have undergone it will try to avoid such contact, thereby decreasing the probability of their contracting STDs.

Either way, it's still very wrong to say that proponents of secular schools don't want to provide critical thinking.  It's the exact opposite.  Here's what Dawkins says:

&gt; “I would never want to indoctrinate children in atheism, any more than in religion. Instead, children should be taught to ask for evidence, to be sceptical, critical, open-minded.

&gt; “If children understand that beliefs should be substantiated with evidence, as opposed to tradition, authority, revelation or faith, they will automatically work out for themselves that they are atheists.

The rest of your points completely miss the purpose of the argument;  To sumarise:

Dawkin's thinks Indoctrinating children with your religious (or political) ideals is pretty foul. 

David Cameron isn't right and that he should be better prepared rather than dismissing Richard Dawkins as ""Just not getting it"".

The irony is that Richard Dawkins asked him a pretty straightforward question and David Cameron dismissed his argument and the labeled man as incapable of comprehending the argument; David Cameron is the one that doesn't understand Dawkins and is a complete tool because instead of actually formulating some kind of response he goes in with the emotionally charged Jesus bull that doesn't progress the debate even remotely.

If you don't attack the source of the argument and just attack points in the wording of it then you'll never get anywhere.

Example:

Person A: ""I think Britian should leave the EU.""

Person B: ""I disagree, why do you think that? The EU is an important source of trade, amongst other things"".

I disagree, and I think most other people do too.  People are allowed to raise children how they want.  I made a comment about raising my hypothetical children as christians on [/r/christianity](/r/christianity) a while back.  [Here](http://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/lubd4/honest_question_would_you_be_offended_if_someone/c2vq1kt).  I think it is relevant, as I should be able to choose what sort of school my child goes to, and whether christianity is taught there or not.  As it happens, I'd probably prefer my hypothetical child not to go to a faith school, but that's irrelevant.

I think he is right, though he should probably take Dawkins apart rather than bluster about it.  This addresses the next paragraph too.  I actually don't think Dawkins does get it - he's so convinced his point of view is inherently superior to religion that he thinks religion should be treated in a different way to other forms of thought.

true,lazyplayboy,null,null,"Focusing on that one element (to stun or not to stun) is distracting.

For various reasons in the last 20 years there has been a massive increase in the average size of a slaughterhouse, with almost complete loss of the small 'back-of-the-butcher' type slaughterhouse.

Animal welfare in the large slaughterhouses is pretty poor. They're very noisy. Use of electric cattle prods to move the animal around is usually very liberal. Stunning is usually very effective, but when it's not it's usually not noticed by the slaughtermen. The only saving grace is that the process is mercifully short for the animals.

A traditional smaller slaughterhouse has less throughput, so there is less pressure on getting the animals through quickly and usually their welfare benefits because of this (handlers not so impatient when moving the animals around, more care taken to effect a good stun, for example).

Recovering from a poor stun is probably worse than no stun. The pain associated with the cut from a sharp blade is nowhere near what you might imagine.

true,[deleted],null,null,"Soviet Russia would be a good example. The early years of the Soviet Union were characterized by a desire to create a materialist theory of the universe (which would give philosophical legitimacy to political theory). One mathematician and scientist, Pavel Florensky, actually came up with a theory which described the world along mathematical principle, providing the means to effectively unite all academic disciplines under the materialist banner (in this sense, even disciplines such as art theory and folklore studes - two areas he branched out into - could be understood with this mathematical approach). He lectured on a variety of topics using this theory in the time immediately before and after the revolution.  

Unfortunately, he also could unite an understanding of religion under this (God was related to an understanding of infinity which underpinned his entire system, which he mapped onto semi-patheistic charateristics of Russian Orthodoxy), which he refused to reject (he believed in the integrity of his system so ardently he in fact became on Orthodox priest). The Soviets executed and hid most of his work behind the sensors. 

Now, this clearly is an extreme example but characteristics of it can clearly be seen in modern secular/religion debates: rational scientific critical approaches are seen (understandably) as contradicting anti-intellectual religious tendencies, and this develops into being generally anti-religious in the (mistaken) belief that religion can never be rational-scientific-critical.

1. Oops, you're correct. I think the ""anti-EU"" lot objected because it was a definite move to an integrated and federal state. As per point 4 I think the UK is generally hostile to this. I certainly think we should be given a referendum on it. Equally, it was clear from the ""No"" votes in France, Netherlands and Ireland that there was widespread unhappiness with the way in which things were changing.

4. [Here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom_European_Communities_membership_referendum,_1975) is a link which gives some information about the vote. As can be seen it was clearly a vote for the EEC and not the EU as it has become.

6.  ""I'd add that there is a political elite running being told how to run the UK by big businesses, so I'm not sure what the difference is. ""

Uhm, ok. Tin foil hats aside the people in the UK have the power to vite parties in and out of office. Lobbying happens across the EU as well as the UK. The point was that the EU Constitution/Lisbon treaty was steamrolled over the ""will of the people"". 

8. EU right-wing != UK right-wing; The UK has a greater free market tendancy than many countries in the EU. Take Sarkozy, technically a right wing party but, being French, he is far more protectionist by instinct than the Tories. 

9. Yes, though cant find any suitable references for it. The UK was/is keen for EU enlargement and was a supporter of getting Turkey in as well as most of the former Eastern Bloc.

There are subsidies for public service workers living in London. An ambulance worker will get £4k more than they will anywhere else in the nation.

This is before you consider the fact that London is favoured in basic spending. They get 105% of GDP. I.E. there is more investment into London than into poor areas of the country. This came up when Paxman went on the attack about the Barnett formula and it turned out despite everything London was clear of all the other UK regions by a mile. It get 3% more per person than the next favoured area of the UK. Compound the financial reward of a 3% subsidy over many years and you get massive economic growth. In good times the GDP growth was only coming at around 3%. London gets this over everywhere else every year. The weird extras are laid alongside the basic budget.

Then there is stuff like the Olympics which, despite claims to the contrary, has huge central taxation funding despite localised benefits and an overall detrimental impact on the economy.

I haven't mentioned the BBC and the fact it also isn't counted in that 105% but does 90% of its business in London.

Religion and philosophy always exist in conversation in the world around them. The Catholic Church is largely medieval in its current outlook, much of the Protestant Church being influenced by early Enlightenment thought. Religious thought has developed after this, even if it's major players are stuck in the past. Florensky I've already stated, came up with a system in which religion fitted with a materialist worldview. Zizek is another who has come up with a materialist understanding of the emergence of consciousness and its consequences, and has stated Christianity (in his own understanding of it) to be of fundamental importance in late-Capitalist society. Christianity and existentialism enjoyed close links and this has carried on with [death of God theology](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God_is_dead#Death_of_God_theological_movement) and [theopoetics](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theopoetics). 

Generally speaking, traditional metaphysics has been rejected in favour of speaking of meaning in being, action and interpretation (similar to how these themes have taken over in philosophy from the Idealism of previous centuries).

&gt; At least sending them to a church school will instill in them values that'll protect them in youth and see them in good stead for the rest of their lives; all this useless nonsense about evolution is something they could look into when they're old, it's not at all important whatsoever compared to drugs and hip hop and exploitation and irresponsible politics.

For that matter they can learn about religion when they're old, it's not important whatsoever. Basic science like biology is exactly what should be taught at school, that's what schools are for.

And I'm sure standards have only gone up in the intervening years since I gave that job up.

It is my understanding that stunning equipment has to be maintained and verified functional to a very high standard. Of course there will be occasions when they fail, but I'd like to bet that such failures would be far more likely to be addressed quickly at a large establishment – where economies of scale make carrying sufficient spares more practicable – than at smaller slaughterhouses and back-street butcheries.


And if cutting the animals' throats without stunning them was the only issue, I don't think there would be quite as much controversy as there is. But the fact is halal and kosher methods both call for the animal to be strung up by its hind quarters while it bleeds out, still conscious! For cattle, at least, their immense weight causes their hind legs to snap.

If someone wants to label themselves a cunt then by all means they should go ahead and do so. I'm quite confident that there will be plenty of other people around to point out it's not on.

My point about people being humourless is that people were trying to claim outrage saying that Clarkston was being serious about wanting to shoot protesters. That is not the same thing at all as him making baseless allegations or generalisations about people striking, as you would in a racist joke.

No, conservatism is a far more complex idea in it's most fundamental form than christianity.

Christianity is said to be like the ocean, you can splash in the shallows or swim in the deep water, but there's always more to understand.

A child can get the very simple faith of

1.  I love Jesus

2. Jesus loves me

3. When I am bad, Jesus forgives me.

Lots of christians I know have made their commitments to christianity under the age of six, and I have seen a six year old getting baptised.  I've seen a man with downs syndrome getting baptised too.  People do understand well enough, and no one understands it all completely.

&gt;I'm not being flippant - I genuinely don't see the difference between a child being able to understand a complex religious philosophy and a child being able to understand politics.

:)  There is a difference between complex religious philosophy, and what is necessary to believe to be a christian.

Not only was he exaggerating for a comedic effect, but he was also doing it to prove his point based on support for the strikers! 

Now they're looking at taking legal action! When asked about what Clarkson had breached, the Unison leader replied ""We're taking legal advice to see exactly what he HAS breached"" Wait, what?!

true,ScreamingGerman,null,null,"I disagree on so many of these targets.

Gary Cahill is basically only targeted because he's English. He's not a true quality defender of international pedigree. I've said it a few times around here, but I think Mats Hummels would make a much better target - much more potential there.

Ashley Cole is still a top-class LB, I'd say the best in the world. Bertrand has looked decent, especially for his age. I think solidifying the right back slot is a much more urgent need, something missing from this list.

Why do we need Tiote? Ramires is doing just fine. When Ess returns to fitness we will be even better off. Unnecessary.

Moutinho as I recall, functions more as a midfield engine rather than a creative force. He wouldn't add anything that we don't already have with Ramires, Meireles, Mikel, Romeu and Essien.

I've watched Mueller quite a lot. He's not a Steven Gerrard type player. He is one of the hardest working players I've seen play, but he's really a SS more so than anything, a winger if needed (as he is for Germany, with Oezil taking the AMF role).

I found these targets to just be a rehash of the main rumors that were floated around towards the end of summer, rather than addressing any of the problems we're currently facing. My transfer wishlist would be: a new CB (Hummels), RB (someone similar to A. Cole or Lahm), a creative midfielder (Goetze), and two wingers (Hazard, Reus, Schuerrle).

I'm sad to say I was at a game in his first season, and after a particularly bad 20 minutes, the Kop started chanting, ""Why'd we get a white Brazilian?"" As he shifted in to a defensive role, he showed how dedicated he was to the club and later became a fan favourite. It's not pessimism people are expressing, it's just gutting when you see a player beginning to hit his peak and you lose him.

I also think the fact that we have no other defensive midfielders is frightening to people. Spearing, while a hard-working player, doesn't get near the high passing percentage, number of tackles, interceptions that Lucas does. Of course, I hope he steps up his game, but it won't be overnight. Lucas came to the club as an attacking player and it took close to a year for him to become consistent in his current role. 

He is the backbone of our defence and transistions in to counter-attack play brilliantly. At a time when we are struggling to score goals, we need to be rock solid at the back.

Supporting a club is not the same as false hope.  Of course I want Liverpool to do well, and I have every belief we are in a far better position to recover from this sort of thing than we would have been before. I remember the first time Daglish left the club and went to Blackburn. We were an aging club with little depth and lots of declining ""legends"".

I think the most disappointing thing about last night was that it was the strongest team we've filed in the group stages of the Europa League, and yet that was probably, overall, our worst performance. The shambolic defending inside the first twenty minutes can partly be blamed on Gallas/Corluka/Rose coming back from injury, but tbh they were basic defensive errors, so it was pretty depressing. I thought Bassong was really poor for both goals. I'll be analysing the goals for my blog this evening, so will go into more detail then.

It'll be interesting to see how we handle the Shamrock Rovers game now - whether we'll go with the youngest team yet, or whether we go all out and try to rack up some goals in the slim hope that we still progress.

It's an absurd counter-view to what he had just said - a common comedic tool. When the presenters apologise for his views, he explicitly says they aren't his views, and that he's just 'providing balance'.

It's still not all that funny, but the manufactured outrage that willfully strips the entire comment from any context is ridiculous. I don't doubt that it won't stop until he's banned from ever working on the BBC again.

true,WindyCOYS,flair8,,"Hmm, tricky one. I guess I have to say Coulibaly, almost by default. He's only 16, but he's a strong boy and by all accounts doesn't look out of place against fully grown men in the Spurs XI (reserve) matches. In the two U19 matches I've seen him in, he certainly hasn't shirked the physical side of the game against physically strong defenders. 

He's not a Kyle Walker/Aaron Lennon-style speedster, but he has got that little bit of acceleration that all the best strikers seem to have, and he has the single-mindedness that means that he will always score goals. However, in a way, that's also his biggest weakness - again, from the little I've seen, he seems to have a Defoe-esque habit of not using a better placed player if he can get a shot away.

Aside from Coulibaly there's Kane, who I think is a good technician, but could do with working on his mobility; Lancaster, who doesn't quite seem to be as highly thought of as the others, although I've only seen him play briefly; Oyenuga, who I imagine will move on before too long; Coulthirst, who is progressing reasonably well, but not yet close to breaking through; and then the older two - Obika, who is on loan at Yeovil (where I could see him going permanently), and Ryan Mason, who I think is a fantastic player, but is 1. more of a number 10/link-player, and 2.

Some of the first years - Ball, Smith, Bush, etc - have barely had a look-in, although I've heard good things about Ball.

I am a big fan of Carroll - I love the way he plays the game, always wanting the ball, passing and moving - but I also think Luongo is a particularly exciting player. Every time I've seen him, he's impressed me. Missing the penalty against Stoke in the Carling Cup was a real shame, as it meant that the first time most Spurs fans heard of him was for something negative, but he's a really promising box-to-box midfield player.

Having banged on about central midfielders, we also have some excellent young centre-backs. Veljkovic (who we signed from Basel) only recently turned 16, but he looks like the real deal. Ekong and Yeboah both look useful, Stewart is very composed at centre back (although he seems to always get stuck out at left back), and I think Caulker is a terrific young player. I was also impressed by Under 16 Connor Ogilvie when I saw him for the first time a fortnight ago.

Weakest? Goalkeepers I'd say.

He's a neat and tidy footballer - has a good touch, his short-passing is decent, he gets his head up - but that's where it seems to end.

He has this reputation as a worker/defensive minded player... I'm not really sure where that comes from! If you read some of Zonal Marking's articles about Everton, Michael Cox frequently highlighted him as a weakness to be got at.

For me, he works relatively hard to get back behind the ball (as most players do), but doesn't get close enough to wingers/full backs to affect them, possibly as he is not as athletic as he looks. I realise that probably sounds odd, but essentially, because he is small and slight and looks like he should be nimble, we assume that he is Lennon-esque in terms of pace; he's not. He's actually deceptively slow and doesn't cover ground particularly well either.

Like I say, I think he's a neat and tidy player but I personally don't think he really has either the Bale/Lennon burst of pace/athleticism or the van der Vaart guile or even the Kranjcar ability to beat a man.

Mats Hummels is being tossed around, and I do like his potential. I think Bruma could be a long term answer here, but we need help this season. Another name to throw out there: Mamadou Sakho of PSG. I don't know how easy he would be to pull away, but he's a great talent.

We really, really need a solid RB. The problem is there just aren't many good ones out there. Van Der Wiel is seeming like the man here (almost by default), but he has the same problem as a lot of other options at RB (lapses in defense). Lahm is the only other option I can think of, but he would be overpriced, and I don't think he would ever leave Bayern for Chelsea.

I think our midfield is looking good, but we need a lot of help in the creativity department. I would really like to see Mata slot in at CAM with Ramires/Meireles/Essien and Mikel/Romeu in support. Lamps still has quality, but it is clear that he is not the lock in that CAM role that he has always been. No need to usher him out, as he still has much to contribute, but he needs to share the spot with Mata. They bring two totally different outlooks to the game (Lamps is a scorer, Mata is a provider), and it could bring a whole new dynamism to the squad.

If Mata stays out on the wing, then I think we need a player of his ilk who plays down the middle. Maybe take a look at Lucas of Sao Paolo ([this Lucas](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucas_Rodrigues_Moura_da_Silva)... I know there are a lot of them) or Mario Götze of BVB.

If Mata slots in at CAM, then please god, bring in some wingers. As in real wingers whose job it is to play on the wing. Hazard looks like a great, natural winger who can play wide on the left and come in to shoot with his right foot a la Sturridge on the right side. De Bruyne could bring the same skill set to the team. Eduardo Salvio would bring us some width on the right side and a player who could provide some service into the box (which has been sorely lacking with Sturridge on the right, for all of his goal scoring ability). I would even take Jesus Navas or, god forbid I mention his name, Neymar.

Mata brought some flair to the squad with his summer transfer, and I think we need a whole lot more of it. We are becoming more fluid, especially in our attacking movements, but we are still painfully rigid when compared with a side like Barca or Real or even Liverpool. I know he's a headcase and a distraction, but if it takes bringing in a player like Neymar to really inject some creativity into our side, then so be it.",0,1322768496,null,0,false,0,c34dxv6,t3_mwbma,t1_c34dxv6,t3_mwbma,1427957835,1,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,1

true,markbesada,lfc99,,"I completely understand where you're coming from as far as the turnaround on Lucas is concerned and how that effects how painful the loss is.  I fully admit that I was one of the fans who cringed whenever he started or was brought on early in his LFC career.  In recounting that fact, just a handful of days ago while talking to other fans, I told them I now thought he was one of the most vital, most valuable players on our club and that I thought he seemed to really, truly love LFC.  He has definitely become one of my absolute favorites.  So, like everyone, I was gutted to see him injuried and learn the latest news.

But I don't think it's false hope to think that this injury doesn't absolutely derail our season the way that so many of my fellow fans seem to.  Don't get me wrong, I understand and empathize with thier distress and pessimism.  I understand that perhaps it appears that our defensive options are not on par with our offensive options.

I still think we have the players to get by just fine.  Yes, Lucas is intelligent and highly skilled, but I think a big part of his game is his industry and bravery.  Maybe I'm completely off...and I'm not being facetious when I write that, maybe I really am...but I honestly do think Spearo and Hendo have the goods to fill in.  I honestly do believe that, asked to adjust his game a little, Kuyt can help fill the gap.  For as absolutely brilliant as Lucas is...and he is, don't get me wrong, it is easier to destroy than create.  I know Lucas did a lot to unlock counters, but his primary responsibility came in frustrating the opponent.  We may not be able to do it as brilliantly as he did, but with the players we have I unhesistantingly believe we can get the job done.

Clarkson himself is not some right wing loon. Not only is it blatantly obvious from his demeanour but I have seen him admit several times on various programmes that he clearly doesn't actually believe the crap that he says on Top Gear and in the tabloids. He is a massive troll and I don't know whether I feel more sorry for the left wingers who get all worked up by him or the right wingers who are all kissing his arse.

And that doesn't even begin to cover the fact that this One Show nonsense has all been taken WAY out of context and he was only making a joke.

If AVB gives them plenty of games together as a unit I promise they will get better.  As for RB, Van der wiel does seem like the default option and would probably be a good one.  Inkoom has been thrown around as well since he is a physical RB.  I think I would be ok with either one of those.

As far as the midfield goes, I'm not very concerned about it.  Between Ramires, Essien, Lampard, Meireles, Romeu, Mikel, and McEachran, we've got it covered.  Assuming a switch to 4-2-3-1 in the future (because it better happen! :p), we only need two from that lot and they don't have to be especially ""creative"".

This would allow for a Sturridge-Mata-Hazard/Goetze lineup with De Bruybe being the backup for the wings.  Sturridge and Hazard/Goetze would be interchangable on the wings (right/left).

However, this is more of a wish list in general.  Realistically speaking, we have 0 chance at Hazard/Goetze this Janaury.  It's just not going to happen.

For example Chelsea have an abundance of stars; Romeu, Lukaku, Kakuta, McEachran etc. Arsenal, Man U ,City all have this great abundance of world class prospects waiting to burst through and I just don't believe our kids are up to anywhere near the same standard, lets be honest the team that played against PAOK last night would have been murdered by an Arsenal youth team. They are not good enough technically, especially at just simple passing, they don't seem to understand the concept of keeping possession, too many times Rose/Kane would get the ball and try to get things happening straight away and ultimately lose possession cheaply. Traditionally spurs don't produce their own players, but if we do want to ever have a spurs academy lad in our first team we need to move to the European model of a youth academy and invest much more into it, in terms of quality tactical, visionary coaches and more international talent, at the moment its too typically english kick and run style football these kids have been taught, no tactical ethos or technical training, just bread and butter 4-4-2 ""get stuck in lads"" training.

I totally agree with what you want to see - visionary coaches, European model, etc. I also know that the club agrees. When Frank Arnesen was with us, he brought in Ricardo Moniz as a ""skills coach"" - Moniz uses the Coerver Method (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiel_Coerver) and was, I gather, seen as totally inspirational at Spurs. 

I interviewed our Academy Director, John McDermott, for the COYS forum two years ago, and he said that Moniz had a massive influence on the players and, arguably more importantly, the coaches. He has since moved on, but the coaches now teach some of his methods to our youngest kids. Obviously it takes time for this to trickle down, but the players coming through now have had some of this coaching and, as a result, are excellent technically and consistently more capable of playing tiki-taka than previous cohorts.

I even think that we have Moniz to thank for players like Mason, Pritchard and Carroll - all excellent technicians.

Re: Bostock... I've never been his greatest fan. I think he's a good player in some ways (he strikes it well, he's strong/athletic), but always doubted his awareness of others/team play.

We played Man City with Lucas and Adam in center midfield. This was by far our best performance of the season. Those 2 absolutely bossed the midfield that entire game. Lucas played destroyer and Adam played creator, and the two of them worked perfectly in that space. I think we would have seen that same setup in every difficult match this season.

We don't have another destroyer who can play in the midfield. Spearing, Shelvey and Henderson are all creative attack-minded midfielders. Gerrard is really the closest we have to another destroyer, but even he is more of a box to box type of player and who knows if he will ever be healthy anyway.

I think LFC should look to loan in a holding midfielder from Serie A or La Liga where players like Lucas who play in Lucas' role are all over the place. I am sure we could get a very good stand in for the second half of the season and maybe negotiate an option to buy should Lucas never be the same again...

They will however fight it, deny you permission to leave and the ombudsman (the people you complain to after you've reached deadlock with orange) will do precisely bugger all.

Vodafone did this in September, I've been complaining since but am still stuck with Vodafone. Best advice is to get complaining, go direct to the directors office. Once that reaches deadlock then complain to the ombudsman. Once that fails, complain to OfCom and, once that fails. Complain to your MP. 

In the mean time, while you're complaining, keep requesting a PAC from orange. They must provide this for free and cannot charge you exit fees unless you use it.

true,samsari,scottish,Scottish exile,"It does rather seem like there's one rule for us and one rule for them. However, to play devil's advocate for a second, these two cases aren't exactly the same. In the ""airport-bomb"" case, he was arguably making a statement/threat of intent, ie. something he himself planned to carry out. In Clarkson's case, he was simply stating a personal opinion (yay free speech) that the strikers ought to be executed. Not too different from the thousands of people every day who say things along the lines of ""hanging's too good for them"", right?

Now, I don't really believe this and I think the twitterer was simply made an example of for treading too close to the line. I personally think Clarkson actually crossed that line, and even if he wasn't being serious (which I guess he wasn't) it was in such poor taste as to be wildly inappropriate. I absolutely love poor-taste humour, and I especially love Stewart Lee's brand of subtle ""is he serious or joking?"" delivery, but it all depends on context and expectations and it's only funny when it's ironic. And while you could argue that Clarkson is a caricature that is prone to such peccadilloes so you should expect such japes, it stops being funny and starts being chilling when the irony is missing. He shouldn't be arrested, but he should be sacked for being a liability and unprofessional enough to not realise when to keep his mouth shut.

true,widgetas,null,null,"&gt; They don't have to understand and argue against every objection to believe. 

The problem I have with this idea (which I understand, so we're clear) is that the child is not being given the option of believing or more importantly: not believing. That is to say, the child a common-or-garden religious family isn't given evidence for and evidence against.

As you say: 

&gt; They don't have to understand and argue against every objection to believe. 

Of course not! They are told something, usually by their parents, and they accept and believe it. Why wouldn't they?

The thing is, for me, when someone is approaching an idea then proof and evidence is a very valuable tool. But religion doesn't work like that, as we agree. That is why I think it an awful idea for faith schools to be so prolific.

I would go further than you and say: They don't have to understand and argue against *any* objection to believe.

Like I said before: they're told what to believe and then learn how to keep believing as they grow up.

&gt; Which ones do you have in mind?

Numerous. At the moment in the UK, and indeed around the world, there is a huge range of people who call themselves Christian. Some are among the most peaceful people who could live while others are happy to kill abortion doctors. Some can live with anyone and everyone, regardless of race, sexuality or (non)faith, while others are quite clear who they do and do not accept.

All call themselves Christian and perhaps the vast majority will identify others who do not share their exact idea of what Christianity is will say that the others are not actually Christian.

Saying that Christianity is vast and some aren't as deep as others is, I think, saying just that: ""Well *those* people haven't thought about it enough.""

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt;You have to imagine the Doctors as totally separate people who just happen to share the same memories.

No I don't, because I'm not convinced it works that way. If the different Doctors view one another as totally separate people, why does Eleven feel so much guilt about Ten's companions in Let's Kill Hitler? Wouldn't he just remember it but attribute it to someone else, hence, no guilt? He also *does* cherish the past -- Ten was INCREDIBLY stoked to see Mary Jane again; he had missed her through six generations! And Eleven generally lapsed into serious self-loathing in S5, probably because Ten was so dark, especially evidenced in the Dream Lord episode.

Why do multiple Doctors (Ten and Eleven at least) care so much about being ginger? Why does River feel so similarly about Eleven *and* Ten? She understands regeneration *very* intimately, as she's been through it herself. If regeneration led to a whole new person/identity, wouldn't she have considered Ten a completely separate man from Eleven?

To me, regeneration it looks much more like an extreme, irreversible mood-shift than the creation of a whole new person; separate surface identities branching from a central constant identity. Nine even said to Rose, ""You won't be seeing me again, not with this daft old face anyway,"" before regenerating (pardon the paraphrasing), which directly points to the Doctor being largely the same guy with a different face.",0,1322793113,null,0,true,0,c34i7vp,t3_mvdi9,t1_c34i7vp,t1_c34gh9r,1427959914,0,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,0

I've only seen him in a few games though, but this is what I gather from thigns I've read too. Here's a [vid](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZ99rhcHcvA). I'd mute just to be safe. He'd be a great pickup, but I'd be surprised if he isn't on every major clubs list. I like [James Rodriguez](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceHL_VvyuII) [too](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ROiax20Q_EY&amp;feature=related), probably safe to mute those. I know these types of vids don't tell you everything, but you can get some sense of their style, and at least what they are capable of. 

here's some stats to go with:

Muniain: Age 18, 5 ft 6

13 league starts: 2 goals (one as CAM one playing as a winger); 2 assists (both from starting on the left); 15 shots, 10 on goal; fouled 38 times. 1 europa league goal in 3 appearances. Like to play short passes, and on the counter. Has been an undisputed starter at bilbao for 2 seasons. 

Rodriguez: Age 20, 5 ft 11

11 total starts: 8 goals, 1 assist. Started as LW for all appearances. He has pretty much took over Varela's spot, and varela is a decent player. 4 goals from 4 shots in Liga. Can score with both feet and his head. Supposedly recently signed a 45million euro release clause.

true,aloofcapsule,tardis,TARDIS,"I like Donna and Martha, not a fan of Rose. A friend of mine and I came up with a thought exercise about the companions: The Doctor arrives on a new planet and has business that he needs to take care of by himself. He tells the companion to wait behind on a park bench next to the tardis.

Martha would ask why she couldn't come, and would stay as long as it sounded like a good idea. Donna would bitch and moan about having to stay, and might follow the Doctor anyway, though she wouldn't get in any major trouble. Amy would sit on the bench and wait it out EVEN IF IT CAUSED A PROBLEM(though if Rory is added to the equation this would probably change.) River wouldn't listen to the Doctor in the first place and find adventures of her own.

But Rose--whatever horrible thing that *could* happen, is going to happen to Rose. If she stays on the bench, it will either try to gallop away with her on top of it, or be outright stolen by hoodlums. If she leaves the bench, she will immediately fall prey to whatever problem the Doctor wanted her to avoid, and become the focus of the episode, leaving him unable to complete his business.

This is all just in my opinion but it is what me and my dad started doing, we only get down 4-5 times a year so maybe someone else knows better. Works for us though as we are on the tube for awhile so beating the crowds and getting a seat is great.

Regarding your questions, again there are others more qualified than me but I will throw in my two pence worth. If you are planning on having a drink then get down pretty early 2-3 hours maybe. I am guessing you don't make it down often so you will really want to make the most of it. You want time to check out the club shop before the crowds are there, though it will still be busy. Check out all the Spurs stalls and just generally take in the atmosphere. Head to one of the pubs and grab a few beers. 

Again all imo but this is what we do. I just love to soak up the atmosphere and the excitement before the game.

true,whencanistop,eng-GreaterLondon,Greater London,"This article is poorly worded and its conclusions are off:

The figures are produced by the local police forces.  I'd like to know how often they test bank notes for cocaine, but the sample is going to be biased as they'll be testing the bank notes of people arrested, not of normal people (unless they are testing their own bank notes).

The quotes from the PC have no place here.  They are anecdotal.  He even says so:

&gt; He said there were anecdotal reports of groups of young men for a night out on the town using powder cocaine to block out some of the effects of alcohol so they could carry on drinking – bluntly to help them stay awake.

Police saying this doesn't make it true nor does it mean that its an excuse for police to be heavy handed at late night pubs.

Finally, it does not ""reinforces surveys that show use of cocaine powder in Britain is the highest in Europe"". It would do that if it had a comparable figure with European cocaine stats on their bank notes.  But there won't be, because most European bank notes are interchangable across countries and relatively new.

It's worth noting that the average councillor earns about £6k per year for their duties - plus maybe a small top up if holding a senior office. No one does the job to get rich, and I think it is a bit mean spirited of the National Secular Society to kick up a fuss about something like this.

On the other side of the equation, even were all the prohibition effective in pushing up the price of addictive drugs, what's the likely impact going to be?  Less drug use?  Maybe a little, some people's use is entirely discretionary and if things get a bit tight economically, they'll doubtless cut back, but much of the demand is fairly inelastic, so what happens is increased _harm_, and harm that grows at a rate relative to price but involving much larger numbers.  Why?  Well, if I'm addicted and I want to continue to use my gramme a day, I might need (for the sake of arbitrary example prices) 100 quid a day rather than 50, so the price has doubled, but in order to finance that, I'm going to have to steal goods to the value of 1000 pounds a day because most goods I steal aren't going to be readily fence-able (TVs, Hi-Fis, shoplifted stuff, jewellery, etc.)

Science was a large part of our curriculum, in fact we had three doctors teaching science at our school compared to non at the local state school.

I've got to go to a lecture now, but I'll be happy to answer further when I get back.

I'm also curious to your view on faith schools, do you feel they should be abolished?

I hadn't thought of that, I guess I'm too blinded to the fact that not everyone in the real world would be as outraged as I would be! I guess my question is, though, what's the point of making the movie, then? If it's to appeal to a world-wide audience, the DW name isn't really going to draw people in by recognition alone (a la Harry Potter). If they Hollywood-ize the hell out of it (explosions with terrible dialogue in an effort to bring in the summer movie-goers), the people that DO go see it and want more probably won't enjoy the TV show much. On the other hand, if they used the same actions/writers/etc, it would draw in current fans while broadening the fanbase of the show.

I guess to me it would seem better for the series, and ultimately the BBC itself, if it were to use continuity stuff. I mean, if I'm the BBC, I'm saying HEY let's make a movie, then run 2 years of episodes while gearing up for the next movie, another movie, rinse and repeat.

true,will_lm,null,null,"&gt;If you honestly believe that, you should ask yourself why it is that none of the dozens of examples of Black on White racism on YouTube and worldstarhiphop.com ever go viral.

I just explained to you why going viral is virtually unexplainable. I don't need to ask myself, I already answered it.

&gt;It's largely the mainstream media that gets to decide whether something goes viral or not (I believe the tram video went viral after it was picked up by the BBC),

It was on twitter and facebook on the 27th, and was on the front page of reddit in the early hours of the 28th. It appeared on the BBC late on the 28th, after it had 2 million views on youtube, and she had actually been arrested. So the stats do not back up what you suggest, the reverse in fact.

&gt;and it's for precisely that reason you'll never see a video depicting Black on White racism go viral - it just doesn't fit their PC/Marxist anti-White narrative.

You see, this is the problem with your analysis. You have already decided that this is the result of some anti-white, cultural marxist conspiracy, no doubt orchestrated by the jews. I've chatted with you before (on one of your old accounts) and I've seen other chats you've had, and it always comes down to this belief of yours that there is this massive anti-white conspiracy. And if I disagree, then I am just another fool, because you're the guy that has the answer.

Well I am sorry, but I don't buy that. And linking me to some dodgy website isn't going to change my mind. Perhaps I am just a fool, but I have never seen any evidence of your theory that is at all convincing. I am not saying that it is absolutely 100% not true, because I can't say that of anything, but from what I have seen there is absolutely no evidence that it is true. I suppose you can take some comfort in your belief that you know the truth, you're the truth teller, the critical thinker, and you've got the real answer. And I suppose it might be frustrating for you that no one is listening. I can imagine how that might feel, and I don't think it would make me very happy.

So I am torn here between having some sympathy for your position, as a (self perceived) lone voice, unlistened to and unappreciated, and a complete revulsion at the place your beliefs have led you to.

It depends on their expectations. Doctor Who has enormous brand recognition in the UK. If they intend to make a modest film targeted at the home market, there's no issue. If they want to crack the US market, it wouldn't hurt to have the director of Harry Potter in charge of another British family franchise.

&gt;If they Hollywood-ize the hell out of it (explosions with terrible dialogue in an effort to bring in the summer movie-goers)

Yates' track record on Harry Potter suggests this isn't going to happen.

&gt;On the other hand, if they used the same actions/writers/etc, it would draw in current fans while broadening the fanbase of the show.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt; Quit and get another job? Didn't you JUST make a point about the lack of job opportunities in this country?

It was a comment of sarcasm relating to the fact you CAN'T just quit and get another job so you should be damn grateful for the one you DO have.

&gt; # You think the reason for striking makes no difference and people should never strike? ""Oh you're lucky you've got any job"" - in that case, let's scrap the minimum wage and you can go work in a field, how about that? Any job is better than no job at all, right?

Suits me fine, you're damn right any job is better than no job at all. By this sentence you clearly look down on people who work in a field as you deem it to be beneath you, or a job that's to be sniffed at.


The fact I detected you were female is not misogynistic at all, it was a bang on statement based on the fact you blew my initial comment well out of proportion, instantly reacting to it as if I was personally attacking you. Which is a female trait, there's nothing wrong in being a female is there? Or did I miss something? 

I stated a fact, and that makes me a misogynist? That's odd. 

You referred to me as HE. Using the same process that I used to determine you were a woman, yet you call ME a misogynist? You're logic is odd, but then again, you are someone defending people who go on strike.


Everyone works for a living and their are people who are a fuck tonne worse-off than you, and by complaining about whatever problem you have with the amount funding you recieve or the way your funding is distributed is completely trivial and is an act of pissing on the bonfires of all the homeless and jobless people of the world.

Right now, you are proving to everyone that you're a shit professional, and that anyone else can do your job better than you do, because all they need to do is turn up for work. That's what YOU are doing, nobody else. 


If you understand the situation with the lack of jobs for everyone in the world, then why not show some respect and stop going on strike for something that isn't even threatening your job.

I like this plan- you've got some good classic in there and such. The only problem is this idea of the 8th Doctor regenerating into 9 and then 9 goes to the other universe *while* the 8th is in the alternate space.

His body may be different but it's still *his*. You can't really trap ""the rest"" of 8th's incarnation in the alternate space while also having him on the outside, new incarnation or not.

Pick Tottenham because of our tradition, our fans, our amazing players, our ability to succeed despite being fiscally conservative, or any other better reason. I'm sorry if that sounds assholeish, I don't mean it that way at all. I am glad you've chosen Spurs and just want you to know that there are many, many great reasons for your decision. 

That being said, what you should know is the reason we fans can sometimes be so pessimistic despite our apparent success. I hate to be that guy to say this, but Spurs have a history of being the great underachievers. In past seasons, aside from the triumph of finishing 4th in 09/10 and success in the CL in 10/11, Spurs have constantly not fulfilled the potential of their squads. That's not to say the mood isn't changing - optimism is slowly overcoming pessimism as us faithful begin to believe that we have finally assembled a squad capable of challenging at the top. But I just thought I'd warn you that we are always sceptical of success, but for this reason, we are all the more appreciative of glory. I posted this in another newcomers welcome thread and think it applies here:

&gt; A true fan is disappointed more than they are happy, and the loyalty through the disappointment is what truly matters


Welcome to COYS!

EDIT: One other thing I remembered: if you're going to follow Spurs' transfer activities, do yourself a favor and wait until the last week/day of the transfer window to start reading anything or getting your hopes up about a player.

true,bloodfyr,mcgann,McGann,"I dunno. I've only seen parts of most of that list, but I've seen all of RTD and all of Moffat so far. I don't feel like typing the whole thing out, so here's some copypasta from when I last had this discussion on this subreddit. It was in reference to a screenshot of the last episode of the Davros two parter, where the Doctor and all his companions are helping to fly the TARDIS: 

""This scene, I felt, epitomized everything that bugged me about RTD's time at the helm of the show, specifically Rose's reappearance. Her leaving the show was a really emotional moment, one that resonated with the Doctor for a long time (the consequences of which really overshadowed Martha as a companion). She left in one of the most complete ways that a character can leave, short of dying. She's in a different universe. She's on the other side of a break in reality that cannot be crossed no matter what. The Doctor has lost a character that brought him back and saved him from the darkness he suffered through as a result of what he did in the Time War. He's better for having known her, but he's once again in an emotional hole for losing her and has to deal with the fact that he'll never see her again.

And then when she comes back, all of the emotional value of that departure is forever gone, replaced instead by cheesy fake ""warmth"" at suddenly ""ROSE IS BACK OMGOMGOMG!"" that can't hold a candle to the investment I had when she was gone. For good. Never coming back. Ever. What makes it worse is that the HOW of her return is never really adequately explained. She's seen skipping all over time and space in our dimension hunting down Ten, and violating what the Doctor said required the Time Lords to accomplish.

In addition to the above...the presence of all of these characters in the episode more than overshadows the return of one of the Doctor's oldest and most deadliest enemies. It flat out ruins it. Because there has to be screentime for the Doctor's shock at Rose and at Jack and at Martha all being there (and for Jackie's screaming. God, I hate that woman.) on top of all the narrative...there's not enough screen time for Davros to be anything but a Machiavellian Bond villain, sitting in a big chair and stroking his cat as the hero is dropped into a pool of sharks. I really felt that in this episode, his return was a really cheap move that did nothing more but add a sense of shock value to the episode (""HOLY SHIT ITS DAVROS!!!""). The villain could have been anyone, even someone made up for that episode, and the episode would have been exactly the same.

As I think back to RTD's years and compare them to two years of Moffat...it really seems to me that RTD consistently forgoes genuine character advancement in favor of these happy, cheery, huggy and (as mishagale puts it so perfectly) self-congratulatory moments. I think its connected with his problems of scale. Each season finale got more and more grand and ridiculous until the whole of reality was threatened on almost a daily basis, and so each of RTD's moments of character happiness gets grander and more ridiculous until we have the sickeningly sweet scene in the picture above, where real character progress is avoided in favor of ""happy huggy"" moments.

I apologize for the rant.""

tl;dr - Both writers have their shitty episodes, RTD's need for fake emotional warmth and cheesy monsters instead of real character investment means he has way more. ",0,1322873856,null,0,false,0,c34see7,t3_mx06f,t1_c34see7,t1_c34r71i,1427964773,0,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,0

I try not to re-watch the parts that I find irritating, so I only ever watch that two-parter up until the Reality Bomb™ is set to detonate. From the moment Donna regains consciousness, the episode goes into a nose-dive that the series doesn't really recover from until *The Water's of Mars*.

I did recently re-watch *Smith and Jones* and *Gridlock*, and I found myself rather enjoying RTD's writing for the first time in a while. I guess it helps to try and watch only the episodes that you remember enjoying the first time, as the only episode I've re-evaluated for the better is *The Girl in the Fireplace*.

All post-revival finales are largely awful though. They all seem to follow the same tired, boring script that the writer churns out as a mindless crown-pleaser (how many times did Earth need to be invaded by classic enemies while people run around screaming and pointing at the sky?). The only 'Episode 13' I can bear re-watching is *The Wedding of River Song*, as it's absolutely brimming with wonderful ideas, concepts and characters (even if it is a partial re-tread of *The Big Bang*) and helps close most of the series' questions in a satisfactory manner.

I think I may have been a bit harsh on RTD in recent years, as he did write some wonderful non-finale episodes. I think that *The End of Time* has consistently clouded my judgement on the issue, as I consider it the absolute worst RTD-penned script. Moffat remains my favourite post-2005 writer, but if you can wade through all the rubbish written by Davies during his time as showrunner, there are some absolute gems that will likely be better-regarded in the future.

I particularly loved The Big Bang. It told such a great, random story with basically four characters and a broken Dalek. I also tend to have a love for plots where you only see half the story at first. The scene with Rory and dead!Amy and Eleven hopping back and forth in the beginning is hilarious and really sets the stage for a quick story. I liked *The Wedding of River Song*, but kinda felt it was trying to cram too much into the episode. It might've made a really cool three-parter when combined with the episode before it. 

RTD had some great scripts. *The Christmas Invasion* is easily my favorite. I deeply love Ten despite feeling he's gotten some of the worst writing in the history of the show. *Smith and Jones* was great, as was the premier of S4 with Donna. But he also had serious trainwrecks: The Titanic episode, *End of Time*, *Love and Monsters*, *Fear Her*, etc. I don't think there's been an episode during Moffat's run yet where I truly disliked it to the degree I despise those.

I agree. Brits also take more time writing before filming. 

American comedy is changing. The old sitcom rule that everything needs to be tied up into a family friendly moral high is pretty much over. 

Those examples are pretty terrible, but I understand you were using them to illustrate your point. 30 Rock, Community, Arrested Development, Louie and a few other shows (just leaving this open ended because I'm sure I've forgotten something) are game-changers. Shows like Whitney are the last gasps of 20th century television. Modern Family is kind of like a hybrid that is probably going to be the last successful show with this model.

The empire hastened the development and spread of technology that improved life for many while at the same time oppressing many more, sowing the seeds of civil war and ultimately playing a big part in creating a shit state of affairs for millions (see Africa).",0,1322895413,null,0,false,0,c34uyna,t3_mycat,t1_c34uyna,t3_mycat,1427965981,12,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,12

But a more awkward question is should it be banned from state schools and under security conditions? Are we allowed to discriminate against someone wearing one?

In my mind there is a world of difference between the Hijab and the Niqab.

There is an assumption that Westerners are new to face covering. As if it has no cultural meaning. I don't think this is true. It comes from an assumption that Western culture is suprior through neutrality, ""anything goes"" and non judgemental. I reckon face covering already has cultural meaning in the West and its connotations are negative. It goes against a Western notions of openness, communication and sexual equality. It is a classic intercultural miscommunication.

true,Ardal,yorkshire,Yorkshire,"This is 100% correct and should be shouted from the rooftops. As a railway safety manager for over 20 years I had to try and pick up the pieces of the lives of drivers utterly devastated by this selfish act. As a train driver you are not able to brake harder (harder than an emergency brake application) or swerve to avoid something. 

The result of this a driver does all he can and then gets to sit there and look directly at another human being about to be exploded all over the front of the vehicle s/he is driving, then they have to communicate the occurrence to several differing parties, protect the train and carry out a number of (necessary) tasks. 

The driver is then alone or with the company of a conductor(untrained in counselling) for considerable lengths of time until a driver manager can get there with a replacement driver.

Then the poor bastard often has to undertake a drug &amp; alcohol screening (for their own sake to ensure there can be no suggestion of impairment later) then the police want a full detailed breakdown (did the person wave, were they facing you, did they squat, how large a bang was it, did they go under the train, was the body in one or more pieces etc) if there is anything slightly suspicious about the death (person not moving or laid over the rail before impact) this questioning can go on for fucking ages. 

The Driver Manager will also need a drivers report for the internal investigations and will have a significant additional workload which ultimately add to the figures or 'railway fatalities' that each year results in the government asking ""what are you doing to prevent these"" 

After the Driver has his/her drug screening it takes 3 days to get the result so they are not permitted to drive until that result is known, this does not really matter as they won't be driving but it psychologically leaves some sort of impression of blame on many of them. 


After a number of weeks of professional counselling (time depends on individual) the driver attempts to return to work on a reduced driving programme with the support of a mentor driver in the cab at all times. this return to work programme takes several weeks (again dependent on individual) at the end of which time the Driver Manger must assess the competence of the individual and specifically measure the impact of driving over the same location at the same speed at the same time of day or night to ensure PTSD does not kick in. 

Very often PTSD does kick in and the whole thing returns to the start of the cycle with the Driver at home undergoing counselling for weeks.

Often a driver never makes it back and his/her career is fucked by some selfish cunt who wanted out.

So yeah, Clarkson is right here not because of delay (fuck delay someone died) but they are selfish cunts for ruining the lives of others, often permanently. ",0,1322917415,null,0,false,0,c34w9lu,t3_myn5e,t1_c34w9lu,t3_myn5e,1427966671,54,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,54

true,lanzalaco,null,null,"I specifically asked Santanders Richard McNicol in newton mearns for a debit card where i could never be overdrawn or incur charges. The debit card chip developed an intermittent fault. The branch counter staff Fiona McGregor advised me to keep using it ""just to test it"". I ended up 21 pounds in debt for 5 days as a result. The card was never supposed to allow a debt to occur. That is the point of a debit card.

My statements now says they have charged me 160 pounds for this and will ratchet it up at increasing amounts every 4 weeks if it cannot be paid. Effectively loan shark payments that will spiral to hundreds or even thousands of pounds very rapidly over nothing but a minor glitch. It does not even matter whose fault these glitches are. They give no warning of the charges or this charge accumulation which is highly suspicious. I found out purely by accident. If it had been after the new year i noticed, I would be into the hundreds of debt over nothing.

Santander now appoint branch managers suited to blatant denial of any fault on their part. Even if you take in evidence they sit and deny everything you say, and refuse to wipe a debt over nothing pulling you into a spiral loan shark style. I caught Santanders Marcus stewart out on two blatant lies. He told me to call customer services to resolve it when the previous day he commented clearly in the branch to his staff that customer services did not work. I mentioned the scandal in the papers and TV to him. He replied ""I dont watch TV or news"". He also denied all the evidence i presented of the faults they had made, even with printed evidence in front of him (which he refused to look at) and said the entire affair was ""my responsibility"".

I asked for no overdraft yet they have a variety of faults in the santander system that can produce a minor debt and cause this. They do not tell you this has occurred. Some people have debts approaching a thousands pounds over small errors before they realize a problem occurred. Santander have no functioning customer services to deal with it. Their UK manager has been questioned by the treasury select committee about this in may this year. 

The system has turned into a scam, after the banks lawyers figured out how to beat down the infamous OFT charges case on a legal technicality last year, the banks are becoming worse as now there is no legal recourse to have charges returned as previously. Their response is to kick in loan shark techniques. These banks should be taken apart completely or nationalized. It is clear from this they are far too clever in what is clearly now a sociopathic style when regulation attempts are made.

I have put their names in, because public naming and shaming is the only recourse we now have in this situation. All statements are accurate, and my case is being considered as part of a class action suit by the consumer action group.

If you're completely new to Spurs, these guys will naturally stand out in our games:

Modric: Not going to get a hat full of goals or assists in a season but a good enough playmaker for Chelsea to offer £40m for his services in the summer. We said no. Watch what the little guy does with the ball and you will see why.

Bale: Until 2 years ago (at left back) he had the worst run of games in the premier league any player had ever seen (22 losses). Manager Harry Rednapp moved him to left wing, and now he's nominated for Fifa pro World 11 2011. He attempted more dribbles than any other player in the league last season. Aston Villa a few weeks ago played 2 x right backs in order to try and shackle him - unsuccessfully.

Van Der Vaart: We somehow stole him from Real Madrid for a measley £8m. The guy has scored more goals for Spurs since his arrival than he's had hot meals in London. He comes from a humble gypsy background but speaks 4 languages fluently after playing football for Bayern Munich, Ajax, Real Madrid, and now Spurs.

However, not all big players might go to the CL teams; some of the bigger players (*cough* Drogba *cough*) might want to go to Russia, the UAE or even China - where it might not matter or the teams won't be so worried about the players being cup-tied. Also, they are still not cup-tied for the FA cup (Budweiser Cup?) which is still somewhat of a plus?

Also, if players aren't signing contracts, it is a waste to let them leave on a free; I'd rather make some money off them while they are still under-contract.

What is surprising is the list of names in the article: Cech, Ivanovic, Bosingwa, Alex, Malouda, Kalou, Anelka, Drogba - the last two having effectively announced their exits. IMO, I'd keep Ivanovic, Alex &amp; Kalou till the end of this season and see if I can ship off Hilario, Bos, Malouda, Drogba &amp; Anelka in January. I'd keep Cech but bring on Krul (Yeah, just finished watching the match!) just to keep BOTH of them on their toes and performing competitively.

One problem is that people don't take responsibility for their own actions. Especially while drunk! 

A ban on advertising wouldn't stop people from drinking, but it would stop officially sanctioned encouragement of alcohol brands. For example when this government tried to tackle binge drinking they had the big alcohol companies and health charities round the table. The charities walked out simply because price changing wasn't considered as an option, which is something all the charities were campaigning for. I disagree with price per units that Scotland is enforcing, because it isn't fair to try to price some people out of the market. But to ban advertising is an attempt to change the fact that alcohol is ingrained in this countries mentality. It helped with tobacco, addiction is now seen as a health concern, and to an extent frowned upon, but importantly it is still legal.

Not everyone has a religion and not everyone needs one. The assumption by various religious groups is that their position is the default and everyone else is somehow different/abnormal.        
Prayers are religious. A local council is not. Some councillors are religious, some are not. Some local people are religious, some are not. Why must the religious people be catered for, particularly in something like a local council chamber that is decidedly *not* a religiously oriented or motivated place?

Why should there be prayers said: what do they actually do? Why should one particular religion be catered for (generally)? As the report says when a different religion had a go, someone walked out!

Something to remember is that this case was not 'started' by the NSS, as it says in the article. Clive Bone, a member of the council, asked the NSS to intervene (when his complaints were ignored, I believe). Various alternatives are available: Councillors who want to pray can do so somewhere else beforehand. The issue arises because some want to keep it *in* the council chamber, so that other people will either have to sit through it in silence or wait outside until they've finished. Added to the problem is that, I believe, in some cases people are not allowed into the chamber once the session has begun - when the prayers are included *in* the session, then there is no way of avoiding it.

Check out the [Black Box](http://www.facebook.com/groups/8235480687/) in town, it always doesloads of really fun events and nights. Every Tuesday in the House Bar in Stranmillis theres a night called ['Intertuesday'](http://www.facebook.com/groups/intertuesday/), where international students and professionals tend to meet up in an effort to meet people. I go the odd time, I always meet nice people when I go. 

[The Empire](http://www.facebook.com/belfastEmpire) does a comedy night which is pretty good, can't remember which night it's own thou! Depending on what age you are and what scene you like, a lot of people I know like [laverys](http://www.facebook.com/laverysbarbelfast) and [Limelight](http://www.facebook.com/pages/The-Limelight-Spring-Airbrake-Katy-Dalys-Auntie-Annies/126786220710192), both kinda mid 20s venues. Laverys also have a pool room on the top floor. Theres loads of places to eat, But [Maggie Mays](http://www.facebook.com/pages/Maggie-Mays-Malone-Road/131737150239807) is great for a cheap feed, esp a Sunday hangover fry! 

Theres a few other events that go on depending on what your hobbies are. Theres [St Georges Market](http://www.facebook.com/pages/St-Georges-Market/129811503726965) Which you really should check out on a Saturday morning, and theres the [black market](http://www.facebook.com/groups/38214185333/) that runs 1 sunday a month at the black box. Also the [Duke of York](http://www.facebook.com/pages/The-duke-of-york/185331278168655) is another lovely wee pub round that area, and John Hewitt is right round from there.

If your into films, or design, theres [The Devour Film Festival](http://www.facebook.com/filmdevoursff), [Refresh](http://refreshbelfast.com/), [Pecha Kucha](http://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100001117937511) and [shooters in the pub](http://www.facebook.com/groups/156216921076267/) (film makers/actors) that are all around that area. I know theres a bunch of guys who meet in [The Garrick pub](http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=87406901663) every Thursday I think it is (I'd need to confirm that) who are comic book writers/drawers. All great ways to meet people. Also theres the dragon slayers at queens uni that do role playing board games and console games every month too. 

So I could go on forever here, but I'll leave it there. If you'd like anymore info on where to go, just ask. Theres a NI reddit meet up every so often so you should prob keep an eye out for that too.

true,[deleted],null,null,"Well it started in October so not one single agency worker has yet reached 12 weeks.

Secondly, it only entitles them to the same **BASIC** employment conditions - basic pay, the same holidays and hours.

There is a loophole - Swedish Derogation. To put it simply, it means that the AWR rights to equal pay of an agency worker no longer exist when agency workers are employed on a permanent basis by their umbrella company or temporary work agency and receive pay in-between assignments.

Its not all bad news though. There are conditions to this – with the first one being that the agency worker needs to be genuinely employed by the umbrella company or agency with a permanent contract of employment in place and that the contract was entered into before the beginning of the worker’s first assignment so technically they cannot now use the derogation on people already at your company through the agency..

Other considerations include:
* For agencies or umbrella companies, **they will obviously have an obligation to pay agency workers during non-working periods**, as well as:

* Ensuring that reasonable steps are taken to seek suitable employment for the worker

* Making sure that any available work is offered to the worker

* **Paying the worker a minimum amount for an aggregated period of not less than four calendar weeks (subject to National Minimum Wage)
The ‘minimum amount’ must be at least 50% of the worker’s basic pay while on assignment. However, it cannot be less than the national minimum wage (in the UK, £5.93 an hour for workers aged 22 and upwards)**

So as long as the agency worker is aware of the benefits of the Swedish Derogation, it isn't necessarily a bad thing especially in the usual post Xmas lull where using the derogation means they'll still get some pay if there's no work.

The new contract will be them signing up to an umbrella company.",0,1322935464,null,0,false,0,c34xxwg,t3_mytkv,t1_c34xxwg,t3_mytkv,1427967460,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

I agree with your other points, however. People tend to look at me slightly bemused when I remind them we're in a theocracy (of sorts).

Interestingly, even though we could/can say councils *are* religious (due to the UK being what it is), many councils do not have any sort of prayer or religious influence anyway, having done away with them years ago (if they had them in the first place). Glos. County Council ditched them again on Wednesday, after they were reintroduced a while ago following a previous removal a short time before that.

If councils can remove them so easily, then I would say that it's unlikely that prayers are enshrined in law.

true,widgetas,null,null,"I don't mean to be flippant, but then I'm sure you'll agree that if principles are nothing to do with it then councils can have Rastafarian ceremonies before meetings. Or Scientology equivalents. Or Cheondoist prayers.

The point is that there are a good many people who are not religious at all and certainly not the religion that is supposed to be the foundation for everything dear in this country (which it is not, but that's another story). If prayers are a *must*, then I think it's only fair that all religions get a go. This is a similar argument that can be used to continue to allow Bishops in the Lords: If they're in there with *very* few CoE attendees then let all religions have representation. Suddenly it's not such a good idea, when you consider that Imams will be there as well as Rabbis, Rasta clergy, perhaps Scientologists, Baptists, Methodists, Catholics ad infinitum.

This isn't just something that can be dismissed with a ""Well X is the religion of the land and most people are X."" It doesn't matter: democracy doesn't, or shouldn't work like that.

If we take your statement and develop it slightly: Well, only councillors who *do* attend the prayer and actually pray can be allowed to be on the council. From that soon you could have a similar situation to a number of states in the US: Only Christians should be allowed to be councillors. 

No need to take those issues to court because the council should be spending money on services and not principles?

That is not intended to be a thin end of the wedge argument but we're talking about actions that are discriminatory, which prayers before meetings are, and only allowing one particular religion to hold sway in other matters is an issue along the same lines. If you would agree that not allowing an atheist or Muslim councillor is obviously discriminatory, then why is having a Christian ceremony, that some councillors are either excluded from physically (standing outside) or have to endure (silently), any different?

Incidentally slaughtering chickens is a religious ceremony - would that not be allowed before a council meeting? For anyone who thinks that would be ridiculous but is OK with prayer - don't forget that are many people, like myself, who see those two actions as being more than similar: They are both actions intended to appease or appeal to a specific god to guide people or events in the right direction. If you think otherwise, I'd be happy to hear why prayer is so different.

If the response is ""Well prayers are harmless"" then it is also harmless to do away with them. What are they doing there apart from giving Christian councillors a feel good feeling or similar? The Christian councillors are not voted in, or paid, to be religious: They are elected and paid to serve the community. They can be actively religious in their own time, or at prayers *before* meetings preferably outside the chamber.",0,1322938633,null,0,false,0,c34yct4,t3_my4sv,t1_c34yct4,t1_c34vhll,1427967657,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

As I'm live on the other side of hte pond, compounded with the fact that I'm relatively new to the sport, I don't have any hard loyalties with any club.  

For the most part I'm free to appreciate whatever team that for whatever reason I find endearing (however, there are three teams in the 3 big leagues that I have a particular fondness for, and I'll root for them over any of their opponents).  In short, I'll root for the beautiful game.  So for example, I became very fond of Arsenal because of their team (but in recent history, their fans are doing a great job of diminishing the affection I have from the team); coincidentally fan bheavior is also what prompted me to take an interest in Chelsea: the Torres move.

He got so much irrational hatred from Liverpool fans that I developed such a strong deisre to defend Torres, and subsequently, I  developed a fondness for the team.  I also had tremendous respect for Ancelotti, and a very strange fondness for Villas-Boas.   So those are the reasons that I root for Chelsea right now.

So yeah, I'll come in and check up on this subreddit once a week or so, along with Arsenal and a few other clubs (I've posted a few times in this sub-reddit).

It's very easy to accuse me of being a fairweather fan (though in all honesty, I don't see anything wrong wtih that, the majority of a sport's followers are fairweather), but that's really not that accurate.

Serials like the Reign of Terror, the Web Planet and the Massacre of St Bartholomew's Eve required a constant effort of will to pay attention.

It is hard to get admission on a PGCE programme, but once you get the PGCE the job market is good (because admission on the programme is limited based on the current job market). It has become much harder in recent years because teaching (which starts at £21K) has gone from a poorly paid profession to an excellently paid profession due to the job market.

Here's the thing though: if you don't have the right to live and work in the UK (i.e. a British passport or residency permit) - there is basically no way it is gonna happen in the current economic climate.

The Highlands something or other is probably Highland Park, which is a nice malt whisky and probably twice the price of Bells. Often spotted on sale at this time of year.

Whisk(e)y for absolute beginners, starting with Scotch:

There are malts and blends. Blends are mixtures of different whiskys, and relatively cheap; malt whisky is the good (expensive) stuff. 

If your parents like neat whisky (or with a little ice or water) they'd probably appreciate a malt. Can't go wrong with Laphroiag (except for spelling); Glenkinchie is splendid, Highland Park is alright, Glenmorangie is  reliable. There are hundreds of others. If they're seriously more interested in the taste than brand-purists, a supermarket brand *malt* is probably pretty good value for money. (Look for ""10-year"" or ""15-year "" MALT on the bottle; it'll be priced a few quid cheaper than the other malts, but don't buy a blend by mistake.)

If I were you I'd go to a few supermarkets and window-shop the malts - see what's on special offer. I've usually managed to get a decent bottle on special in the run-up to Christmas.

Whiskey with an e is Irish. In terms of value for money, it's absolutely brilliant. Priced halfway between the Scottish blends and malts usually; for taste I actually prefer it to some of the malts and all of the blends. Bushmills (older the better) is bloody fantastic, and I am completely reconciled to the fact that it will probably be the end of me; Jamesons or Powers are also alright &amp; far better value for money taste-wise than any cheap Scotch.

If your parents like to mix whisky (coke, lemonade, ginger etc.) do not buy any of the above: buy a non-insulting bottle of a blended whisky (I'd go for Famous Grouse, but Teachers or Bells will do if on special). 

American whisky (with the exception of Jim Beam which I am fond of for rather sordid nostalgic reasons) is mainly produced as a specialist cleaning product, for the carburettors of German cars. The Germans produce wine as a courtesy to Americans, and for the same purpose.

Hope that helps. Oh, and keep out of the specialist malt shops north of the border, they're full of tossers.",0,1322953537,null,0,false,0,c350c7x,t3_mywlq,t1_c350c7x,t3_mywlq,1427968592,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3
