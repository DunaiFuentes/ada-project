true,janoo1989,tom-baker,Tom Baker,"I'm not saying I agree with anything you've said but I'll let it all pass except for the part about Rose's relationship being more powerful than the Ponds. They really went off the wall with the emotional attachment when it comes to Rose Tyler and I think that's what most people see as powerful. While I do agree that Rose/Doctor was terrific (a large part of the show's initial success is owed to this relationship), I must say that the Doctor's relationship with the Ponds is far more nuanced and mature. It's less patronizing; which is what makes the argument that *Doctor Who* is now more angled towards younger fans quite ironic. In fact, the more popular complaint comes from people saying that the show's gotten too dark; a complaint that's quite. 

Anyways, what I appreciate most about the Ponds and the Doctor is how despite how platonic it's become, the importance of these 2 people to the Doctor remains incredibly apparent. This is why the final scene of the episode was especially great. It was poignant, subtle but still powerful, attributes that the RTD *Who* never really even tried to pull off. There's a dignity and grace to it.

As for River Song, that's a relationship that's completely different. It's completely mad and impossible, which is why it's so damn fascinating. Also, unlike Rose, River has no qualms about expressing her feelings for the Doctor. What's enigmatic is the Doctor's feelings towards her. It's fantastic!

i guess the whole 'there's nothing stronger than a mother's love' trope doesn't really resonate with me, and that was the whole point of this episode. i really, really fucking hated madge. i don't know why they would make a character that unlikable. and the weak/strong gender thing made me cringe because HELLO, reverse sexism is still bad, guys! 

plus the science was just...not science. the doctor is just falling? and swimming? through the vacuum of space? not dying? yelling? and BREATHING????? for the first 30 seconds or so of the episode? which (i'm sure i don't have to point this out) makes no scientific sense at all. if i missed some kind of explanation for this, please let me know. pretty sure time lords can't breathe in space either. i don't normally nitpick about plausibility in sci fi, because saying that's a losing battle is kind of the biggest understatement of the century, but come on. this is like elementary school science. and later madge's husband somehow manages to follow them through the fucking time vortex in his damaged WWII fighter plane? how. why. these questions are never answered beyond ""madge did it WITH THE POWER OF HAVING A VAGINA! PLUS CHRISTMAS!"" my suspension of disbelief simply doesn't stretch that far. 

good points: visually, it was pretty. humany-wumany was super cute. bill bailey only got about 30 seconds of screen time, but they were the best 30 seconds of the episode. amy/doctor hug thing felt real and cute and gave me fuzzies. amy saying they always set a place for him was heartwarming. the end where the doctor sheds a tear and it finally really snows for him was touching.

*Niiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiice*

With the still frames, it's tough to blame either Terry or Bos. I thought Bos was a bit slow accelerating with Bale though, I believe he does some stutter steps towards the top of box as if to feint a cut in and shot, and Bos reacts slowly once Bale pulls away towards the touchline. I'm not sure if I'm remembering correctly or if the frames don't quite show that.

However, you really have to question what Ivanovic was doing. He doesn't make an attempt to catch Bale, he doesn't cover the middle/Adebayor or even pretend to cover a trailing person. Surely he'd be closer to Bale if he were providing double coverage or a failsafe is Bale beat Bos. He was caught ball watching on the play and it's simply unacceptable at this level.

Was hard to see, but I thought Cech made a mistake on the play. Can't blame Terry for this, or Bos really. Terry was in prime position and Bale put in a great cross.

This definitely exists but it isnt that out of the ordinary. In Canada, for instance, I understand that every school day begins with the national anthem. 

At least in my school it wasn't required, and there were some kids who remained seated for the pledge, and nobody really cared. It's more of a tradition that we do out of habit without thinking too much of it.

I think that the rest of the world ends up with a slightly skewed (but not completely wrong) view of the culture of the United States from our media. Fox news, train wreck that it is, will obviously get more attention than MSNBC or CNN just because they and their demographic is just so much more grotesquely fascinating than the more sedate and reasonable American, who I truly feel is the more numerous.

Dont get me wrong, the type of blowhard American you are talking about definitely exists, but I think they are often seen as the standard when even most of us laugh at them. This is a huge country with a huge variance from region to region. If you came to Portland for instance you might be shocked at how viciously people attack their own country on political and moral grounds.

true,douchebag_karren,null,null,"So I was watching the merlin marathon, before this and right before I watched this was the episode that Morgana has the preminiton that Gwen will be queen. So watching this I figured they would just reuse the same footage. Oddly enough they didn't, which I find mildly interesting. there are small changes, Arthur and Gwen kiss in real life, when they didn't in the premonition, Arthur's hands move differently to take her crown, Merlin is dressed differently and in the premonition they sit as the camera moves back, while here they stayed standing. it makes me wonder if this was deliberate to maybe see that Morgana doesn't perfectly see the future, and maybe somethings can be distorted. 

Now that Isolde is dead, I wonder if Tristan will be joining the knights as he does in the legend. 

I really wish it had been Gwen to save Arthur, Not Isolde, just so he would have a different turning point to letting her back in, besides seeing isolde die.

* **Series 1 - Episode 1 ""Rose"".** It's the beginning of the reboot. 

Upsides : ""Normal"" starting point. You get to see the series in order. Everything is explained, and there are very little references to older episodes (and nothing critical, just a few jokes). The show keeps getting better as you watch (for most people anyway)

Downsides : A few bad episodes and several meh episodes, especially in the beginning. Seriously, the farting aliens are just terrible.

* **Series 5 - Episode 1 ""The Eleventh Hour"".** New Doctor, new companion, new head writer, it's like a small reboot.

Upsides : A lot of excellent episodes in series 5 and 6, so less chances to get discourages by the few bad episodes for the early series. New companion and new doctor, which mean less references to older episodes...

Downsides : ...but there are quite a lot anyway. Also, *you don't get to see the beginning of River's story arc*. I put this in italics because I think it's really important. Seeing series 6 before the first episode with River might spoil the effect the episode is supposed to give.

If they're going to have such a system with competition for school places then I don't see anything (technically, legally) wrong with renting out your house for a year and moving closer to the school you want your kid to go to. 

However I think the case earlier this year of the kid who wasn't allowed to go to the school she lived next door to was fucking ridiculous - instead she had to travel miles each day. That would never have happened in my dad's day, nor mine, probably - except in the case of an exceptional grammar school for gifted kids, you all went to whatever school you lived closest to, just like your neighbours. 

I'm halfway inclined to think the best fix is just to go back to kids going to their nearest school and doing away with competition for places, because this would lead to parents getting more involved in the problems of failing or inadequate schools.

Once you've put it in a decent padded bag that will provide adequate protection, and perhaps added a second lens, a dSLR is surprisingly bulky.

In the daylight, summertime, 9  times out of 10 a compact will take photos which are just as good. Maybe go for something advanced which will give you a little extra ""creative control"".

I think the test would be to see if honour killings are a typical feature of Muslim religion even when it is disconnected from old traditions. So if there was support for honour killings amongst African-American Muslims (who I *think*---I could be wrong---have relatively little to do with the historical traditions that are shared by many Middle-Eastern Muslims), that might indicate that support for honour killings was indeed more to do with Islam than conservative Middle-Eastern traditions commonly associated with it.

One might also look at support for honour killings amongst non-Muslim people from the Middle-East, or try and see if stronger support for honour killings correlated with intensity of religious belief or practice.

That one used to get (or still gets?) honour killings in Sicily and and various other parts of Europe certainly indicates that it's far from being a problem unique to Islam.

I liked some of the one liners, the general 'boys adventure stories'/narnia theme, Bill Bailey cameo, ""hold on tight and pretend it's a plan"", ""happy crying"" and the Ponds. 

Didn't like the fact that it dragged quite a bit. It was cheesier and campier even for Doctor Who but Christmas episodes always end up being a whole lot cheesier and campier so that's to be expected. Christmas episodes always feel like fan service for Kids, which is fine I suppose. 

But overall I quite enjoyed it. Not perfect or the best, but watchable. One thing I haven't seen people comment on is how the Doctor is still in hiding. He never introduced himself to anyone as the Doctor. Instead he was the ""caretaker"".

It is odd that AVB's men are struggling so much finding net (apart from sturridge--but even a few of his goals are mop up counter attacks).

I think that team needs Essien back, and as much as it hurts to say, Lampard isn't getting the job done.  Mikel needs to go, and because Mata and Malouda basically play the same style and position (although Mata will drift inside more) we can let him go and take a decent transfer fee.  They could do the same with Kalou and allow him to leave.  If they did that, it might give more confidence to both Torres and Drogba and confidence is sometimes the biggest key for a striker's output.

As far as needs, I think that with all of the focus on the midfield, AVB needs to look for a midfielder that will compliment Ramires and and Romeu for the future.

Lukaku needs to go on loan, because lets be honest, he may be the future, but unless he's making strides in the training ground he is not getting the playing time to be truly improving.

Upon landing, he realized that the glowing light he was following (a real UFO by any interpretation) could be a threat, so he told the crew to hide in the plane while he checked it out.  He then learned it was piloted by his wife (the love of his life, the woman he would do anything for).  He understood that the government would never allow her to live a normal life at home with her children again if they knew what she had done.  He could keep this secret.  Of course he could.  His love would see to that.  But the others.  They may not feel so strongly.  Sure, in the joy of the moment, they may claim they would never tell.  They may even mean it at the time.  But eventually, the would all talk.  They would be sharing a drink with an old war buddy and mention how they got home, and that was unacceptable.  So when his wife and children weren't looking, he got back in the plane and ensured they would never speak of it ever again.  His wife would never have to know.  Clearly the plane had been damaged.  It's not as if she'd be able to tell the difference between flak injuries and bullet holes.

Not necessarily so, instinct certainly says otherwise but of course it depends on how one defines the term and how many generations you care to count. I would say *this* is not even close to capitalism. Capitalism should be inherently risky with incumbents always fearful of any challenger in a 'free market'. Dynasties should fall as quickly as they rise and spoils of the father shouldn't echo too far down the generations in the most part. That was true in the late middle ages where wealthy families could appear due to the low hanging fruit of the new found lands and the rapid emergence of technology, but a bad storm or better tech could bring a swift end. Of course then came the beginnings of the corporation, single currencies, and more significantly chartered monopolies. Fiefdoms inevitably returned, that's if they even went away: Elizabeth Windsor is still the greatest land owner in the world.

&gt; Money and Experience that parents have, buy their children a better future.

The law of diminishing returns is at work here, I mean, after a particular point do subsequent millions afford access to greater prospects and education? I think what the article is focusing on is that 1%, those that can buy access to legal privilege and monopoly to entrench their dynasties to the point where ownership is the only prerequisite for success.

It's sad that I am genuinely not surprised by this result. 

Fans can make excuses all they like.. ""away teams get so lucky"", ""we get bullshitted with ref decisions"" ""that wasn't a red/penalty"".. you know, at the end of the day, ref decisions are no excuse. For the most part it is an even amount of bullshit dealt out to all the teams. 

It's time to recognise that, attacking, we just aren't good enough. As it is, we don't deserve to be in the top 4, and if this performance persists, we won't. Ever. It's a joke. Liverpool have me wondering why I bother even spending almost 2 hours of my day watching our pathetic attempts to break down Sunderland, Fulham, Stoke, Wigan, BLACKBURN.. the list goes on. Why even fucking bother when I know that the best I can POSSIBLY hope for is a 1-0, and usually a goalless draw or a 1-1.

Change is needed. We need to eject the freeloaders, the shitbags, and bring in genuine talent. Carroll is shit. No offense to the guy. Big money transfer to a big team, everyone jeering your price tag, I'd probably choke too, but the fact remains that he isn't performing and he doesn't work well with Luis. Henderson and Adam (bar his OG today) are actually coming along, and more power to 'em, and Enrique's well publicised success is clear to everyone who can bear to sit through a Liverpool match. Downing - no. Downing is performing worse than Carroll, who has at least scored a few goals. Downing needs to go. 

At this point many of you are probably screaming bullshit and cursing me with obscenities. I don't care. Face the truth. Competition this year among the top teams and all teams for that matter is stiffer than ever. EVER. Other teams buy quality South Americans/Spaniards with amazing ball control and real potential. We buy English. Not on. And this is down to Kenny. A king among the club he may be, but it is clear to all that he wants Liverpool to have lots of Brits. Maybe in midfield or defense I can see this. But leave the forward play (strikers,wingers) to the experts, to the lads with real pedigree in the field, the South Americans and Spaniards, maybe even Italians and Germans. The fact id England is shit at striking (bar maybe Rooney), so we have to shop elsewhere. 

Okay, so Carroll and Downing might have potential, but frankly the other teams are passing us out fast enough - we don't have time to discover that potential, which in itself is minute. They need to go. ASAP.

Christmas needs to be the turning point.

We NEED to BUY a winger and one or two strikers. Cavani would be the ideal partner for Suarez. Cavani is like Carroll, only amazingly good. An absolute tank with something known as ball control, the two Uruguayans would dominate up front. I'm also a big fan of Bojan, but I doubt we'd get him, but it'd be great if we did. There are lots of good wingers, but maybe someone like Robinho? We'll see, as long as he isn't English.

Also, MAXI NEEDS TO BE A FUCKING CONSISTENT STARTER WTF KENNY?!?! JUST BECAUSE DOWNING IS ENGLISH DOESN'T MEAN HE GETS TO START EVERY GAME! MAXI SCORES ALMOST EVERY GAME HE PLAYS MORE THAN HALF AN HR IN AND YET YOU LEAVE HIM OUT ALMOST EVERY TIME. 

INB4 Maxi haters: Yes, most of his goals don't require the most amazing of finishes, but the fact is he scores the goals, just like Javier Hernandez.",0,1324926159,null,0,false,0,c3bbmq9,t3_nr5mk,t1_c3bbmq9,t3_nr5mk,1428078460,6,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,6

Yes, because I've been fantasizing for years how it ought to be.   The Doctor should visit her in the year 2212, with London rebuilt as a shining futuristic city, and it would turn out that he's been back to visit regularly through several of his incarnations.  This time, though, she's called him because there's a problem and she needs his help.  It turns out there's a conflict between Earth and some alien race, and humanity is mistrustful and paranoid, having survived and overthrown a complete Dalek takeover of their world.  How this conflict gets solved will decide if humanity joins the Galactic Federation as a peaceful world, or becomes an imperialist conquering threat.  Only the Doctor and Susan can save the day.  There's a happy ending and the Doctor tells Susan how proud he is of her living up to all his hopes for her.

No, because if they really do bring back Susan, it won't be like that at all.  Instead, the whole thing will be Susan pining away because her Grandfather never ever came back, and she's done nothing all this time but wait for him, and the Doctor wracked with guilt because he let her down like he always lets everyone down, sob sob sob, life is so tragic, much rending of garments, Susan forgives him but then is killed off senselessly, everyone else has a long cry about it, the Doctor goes away feeling sad, but it's all okay because this was her choice.  And I go off and throw up.  I prefer my fantasy version.

On the other, the more I scrutinize the episodes, the more it seems like it was *always* The Doctor in the Tesselecta.

One of the major contributions is the fact that the TARDIS is missing during the Impossible Astronaut. Which would mean that it was inside the Tesselecta(As it was during The Wedding of River Song). There was also a lack of an actual connecting scene.

true,beard-maketh-the-man,eng-yorkshire,Yorkshire,"It was a combination of diet and exercise.

Been hovering around /r/fitness reading any advice I could get.

Getting a physical job kick started it for me, hard labour all day combined with 7 miles cycle each way.   So that got me fit.  Then I just reduced calories.

I would eat a 3 egg omelet for breakfast.  Peanut butter sandwich (wholemeal) with some fruit and seeds as sides, plenty of water during the day.  Then when I got home I stuck to lean meats with veggies and potatoes.

Nice and simple, all very boring but it worked.

Sadly I lost my job so the amount of exercise I get has been greatly reduced.  Once the holidays are over, time to get into the gym and get back on the cut calories diet.  Going to start walking and might have a go at jogging (C25K program).  

The commute each day has really got me into cycling, really enjoy getting out on the bike.  Shame it's been so shitty this past month.  Really looking forward to the summer, want to get a road bike and really start knocking some miles out.  It's great getting fitter, I guess you're like me and avoided exercise but once you get into it, it's a great feeling getting a good sweat on.

I'm pretty ignorant about this too, I'm afraid. I suppose you're right to conclude there's been no close equivalent to pope / Patriarch of Constantinople / Archbishop of Canterbury type thing in Islam since the last Caliph.

Maybe look at who British Muslims typically regard as their earthly religious leader(s), and see what they say about honour killings. I'd be surprised if they were in favour of them.

If Rose saved her father, then her new-timeline self would have no reason to go back to that point; and therein lies the paradox - there is no simple, logical timeline where her father was saved _and_ she went back to that day.

Based on that second point, my wildly speculative hypothesis for why Rose touching Baby!Rose was a problem is that, already being in a paradox-tainted timeline, some variant/related law to the (mostly absent in the new series) Blinovitch Limitation Effect kicked in, making Rose-Rose contact a very volatile temporal situation.",0,1324938685,null,0,false,0,c3bd4rz,t3_nrg7u,t1_c3bd4rz,t1_c3bcwii,1428079158,4,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,4

So, basically your list, but with AGMGTW switched out with those last three.

If he likes it then, you can just have him keep watching from ""The Beast Below"" onwards.  This way, he gets invested in the show before actually starting it with Matt Smith's Doctor, and he also gets to meet River before starting Series 5, which is important IMO.

Plus, you get plenty of action, meet every (major) companion (since 2005), and has plenty of ""Holy fuck the Doctor's awesome,"" particularly with his ""Look me up"" and ""Hello, I'm the Doctor"" speeches from the last two episodes on the list.

So then he can watch Series 5 and 6, catching up without missing any of River's story, then go back and watch all of Series 1-4/Specials while waiting for Series 7 to start.  (You don't want to risk them starting with Series 1 and not being caught up when it comes back!)

...Seriously, though, don't use AGMGTW.  You don't want to spoil River for a new viewer.

true,ghostridethewhip,null,null,"It was a pretty awful game, in that it was both boring to watch and not well played. There were a couple of good moments from Chelsea, but most of them were moments of individual brilliance (i.e. Torres chest control to shot right at the keeper). We were lacking in creativity, but we were lacking in appropriate tactics/pace/ball control/attitude as well. The first goal came out of nowhere, and then we looked content to close up shop and walk the ball around the pitch for most of the rest of the match.

My biggest problem with this Chelsea squad is that we lack killer instinct. Chelsea teams of the past, even when in a bad run of form, had that edge, so that when we went up a goal we knew we could go on and get another one/two/three or more goals to seal the game. As a spectator this season, I feel uncomfortable when we are up 1-0, almost as if I anticipate the other team will even up the score.

Today, we went up 1-0 and were very, very patient in defense and in attack. That would be all fine and good if we were creating something on the offensive side of the ball, or if Fulham were not threatening at the other end. Instead, we knocked it around slowly and eventually lost possession when a frustrated Bosingwa or Sturridge or Luiz sailed the ball into the stands as they tried to make something happen all by themselves.

As much as I hate to agree with the extremely annoying color commentator, he is right that we should have pressured the ball more and tried to pick up the pace from back to front. Yes, Ramires would have helped in that capacity, but Romeu/Meireles are not exactly slow.

When Rose touched baby Rose, that didn't cause a paradox. The paradox that caused all the scary bat chronovore things to appear was a time traveler, like Rose/The Doctor, going back across their own time line, saving Pete Tyler, thus eliminating their whole reason for traveling back there in the first place.  Time goes all rippy-wippy, and chronovores appear. The contact between Rose and baby Rose was never the cause of the paradox. It did cause an amplification of the existing paradox I imagine, allowing them the chronovores through, but the paradox had already happened.

In Kazran's case, the Doctor went back specifically to meddle in his timeline, and any paradoxes created probably weren't as big as someone significant as The Doctor/Bad Wolf crossing their own timelines after a much longer journey together. The contact wasn't that significant. Who knows, it might have amplified some existing paradox, but it would be like multiplying 1 times 2 versus 50 times 2.  The multiplication is the same, but the starting number makes the end result much bigger.

It felt too ham handed. The dialogue sounded like we were supposed to laugh at every line, and everything everyone said was supposed to be a joke or throwback or catchphrase. I didn't think it was funny. 

My suspension of disbelief instantly popped when the Doctor fell to earth dressing in a space suit. The stupid white men killing trees, and women being smart enough to pilot a mecha from beyond the 51st century that normally takes about 10 years was just too heavy handed. Then there was the whole rewriting time to get her husband back. All the really cliche emotional things that didn't really strike a chord with me.

I mean their dad is dead. They are in a wooden time machine piloted by their mom. The completely natural fact of life that people die in the war seems less traumatic than your mom carrying an entire forest in her head and time traveling.

true,TheDirtyFlipFlop,null,null,"If by drama, you mean soap opera, then yes, Moffat has made the show extremely ""dramatic"".  

I mean honestly, Moffat took Doctor Who from a show that was about the Doctor's adventures, and turned it into something that should be found on daytime television.  He forced River on us so hard, that I feel like I should file a police report.  River is good in small doses, but to base an entire series around her?  Bleh.  Not to mention Rory and Amy.  They were so weak as companions.  Pretty much all Rory did was die, and Amy added nothing.  My favorite episode of series six would have to be ""Closing Time"" because we finally got a break from the two of them, at least for a little bit (could have been much better if Craig didn't destroy the cybership with love).  Don't even get me started on the season finally of series 6.  That may have been possibly the worst episode that I have ever seen, followed closely by ""Let's Kill Hitler"".

I cannot stand what Moffat has done to the show.  Don't get me wrong, he is a good writer, but he is TERRIBLE when it comes to plot.  He's great with filler episodes, but ask him to write anything more than that, and it is pure drivel. 

As for the Christmas Special, I actually thought it was fairly good, at least until the last ten minutes when, OF COURSE, he just had to throw in Rory and Amy again (Side note: anyone else think its weird that Rory and Amy don't really care that they don't get to raise their child?) 

I'm not saying this to piss people off, and I want to apologize if I came off as a bit sarcastic/rude to LibraryDrone, but I just really hate what has happened to this show.",0,1324961873,null,0,false,0,c3bg5zt,t3_nr1rr,t1_c3bg5zt,t1_c3bczfn,1428080589,1,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,1

true,stop___grammar_time,tardis,TARDIS,"I agree. Rose's family sort of adopted the Doctor. Look how they interacted with him: Jackie seemed to treat him like like just another one of Rose's boyfriends, even after the revelation that oh, by the way, *he's a centuries-old alien who travels through time and space.* Hell, even Mickey, Rose's ex, whom she seemed to have a good, normal, healthy relationship with, which *she abruptly left in the middle of an alley after an alien invasion, during which he was abducted and cloned*, accepts him as a friend. Even both versions of her dad seemed to think that he was OK.  
Rose's arc was very Disney fairytale-like: Handsome stranger sweeps young girl off her feet, charms her while having a bunch of adventures along the way, they declare their love for each other after a particularly traumatic event/adventure at the end of the ~~movie~~ arc.

Compare it with the Ponds: He first meets young Amelia, seven years old, no parents, raised by just her aunt. He imprints on her, and she grows up obsessed with him. We then meet her again as an adult, at a point where she's convinced the Doctor's imaginary. His apperance not only undoes years of therapy, but rekindles her obsession with him. He reappears the night before her wedding and whisks her off, an event she's been waiting twelve years for. Amy's geeking out, travelling with her ""imaginary"" friend, who's everything she's imagined him to be. She gets caught up in the fantasy and the excitement, and throws herself at him sexually. He rejects her advance, and brings her fiance on board to ground her in reality. She gets the hint, and realizes that this is her *reality*, not the fantasy she's had since childhood. From that point on, she takes her relationship with Rory seriously, and actually gets to know the Doctor as a real friend as opposed to treating him like the person she imagined him to be. Amy looks up to the Doctor as an older friend and guardian. 

The Doctor however, still sees Amy as that little girl who served fish fingers and custard to him, as shown in Let's Kill Hitler. The Doctor has essentially adopted Amy as family. He treats Amy more like a daughter, and Rory like a son-in-law. 

**TL;DR:** The difference: The Tylers (and Mickey) essentially adopt the Doctor. He's like ""the daughter's boyfriend"" with them. The Doctor however, adopts the Ponds. He's more like ""the cool foster dad/father in law"".

It also depends on how you manage the GP surgery.

true,brisingre,null,null,"Those are some bad episodes, with the exception of the Dalek double, which I really liked. The setting was cool, the characters worked, it all held together pretty well. 

But they all had something redeeming them. 

Fear Her was probably Tennant's worst episode, but it had one of Tennant's best moments, lighting the Olympic torch. Really drove home how different he was from Eccleston's doctor, this sort of eternally carefree maniac, who does what he does because he absolutely loves it, rather than the battle-scarred adventurer of the past season.

Idiot's Lantern was funny. This wasn't funny. Maybe it was just funny because of how ridiculous it was, but it made me laugh, and this just made me worry about the writing on Doctor Who.

Closing Time had all the same things wrong with it that this had (It was sappy, and it didn't make a lot of sense) but it was less sappy than this was, and it made more sense than this. Hell, it made it right to the end before it did anything unbearable, right until he resists a cyber conversion by the power of love it's a pretty good episode. Spooky, revisits a character I rather liked, all of the Stormaggedon stuff was funny... This episode got bad as soon as the kid opened the box, depending if you're going to be a stickler about the Doctor breathing in space.

And this isn't the worse Deus Ex this show has had by a long shot. But Deus Ex doesn't kill an episode on it's own. If it did, the show would be unwatchable. Deus Ex is fine in the Series 3 finale. I mean, power of prayer is a cop-out, but it's a cop-out to a series of three of the best episodes of Revival, and they at least handwaved it in a way that didn't make me want to scream at my TV. The Series 1 Finale tempered its Deus Ex (Heart of the Tardis) with one of the smartest things ever done on the show (Bad Wolf paradox) and, while that doesn't negate the Deus Ex, it saves the episode. The worst finale in terms of damage from Deus Ex is Series 4, IMO, but it's still better than this. This doesn't really have anything going for it after the Doctor gets that suit off. It just gets steadily more contrived and less interesting. It's a not-terribly-interesting premise, with a bunch of not-very-interesting-but-very-contrived twist and a terrible, unsatisfying, nonsensical ending.

This compounded with wing-attack being especially hard due to Mata's sub-par performance and Sturridge's over-confidence with the ball made scoring especially frustrating.

I think there was a lot of high power politics in the wake of each debate eg Guardian / BBC desperate for a viable candidate in the aftermath of a Labour demolition in order to keep public spending high.

I just recall Clegg always using the same patterns.

1. When you got to the detail of some wishy-washy policy - ""we'd get everyone round the table and come to a solution"". Read: we've not thought about it in any detail.

2. When we got to a point where Labour and the Tories were quite different - &lt;shrugs_shoulders/&gt; ""look at these two always arguing, Uncle Nick will sort out the kids"". Read: playing to the cheap seats.

I saw both of the above enough times to draw the conclusion that he was a shyster. I think now many agree with me as he's not done much at all and was basically lying to get into power (not that Cameron or Millibean are exempt from this accusation).

I genuinely thought his debating style was really weak and that he was a ""low quality thinker"". I've not seen anything to change my mind.

I also knew the economy was going to head south rapidly as the election was fought on spending pledges that could never be met. For this reason I'm not in the insane camp that thinks Clegg should be hung from Lib Dem HQ for not spending loads of state money. It's just not there.

Lets take your worst case scenario - and lets assume the economically impossible happens, in that a hospital chooses to put half its resources at the service of private insurance.

What happens to the money they make? It gets reinvested back into the hospital - and you end up with a bigger hospital with more staff carrying out more operations.

Is that a bad thing?

In reality, the NHS would ever be in that situation as the private medical providers aren't large enough to require that level of capacity. However, it does allow individual specialist hospitals to raise their income - so you end up with more treatments at no cost to the taxpayer.

About half the NHS budget has always gone to private companies - ever since it was founded that rule has held true.

Most GPs and Consultants are privately employed and run a business selling services to the NHS.

As most of us think the NHS is wonderful - and yet it can only be so because half its budget is spent on private providers - what is so awful about those private providers?

This is a fallacy as we don't know what the NHS would be like if it wasn't so privatised - contracting out cleaning etc. could certainly be argued to have damaged the NHS, and likewise the way in which GPs are employed is simply a rather one-sided compromise the GPs were able to achieve over the post-war Labour Government which has also become a lot more private with the advent of Thatcher and Blair etc.

Cheap tricks are nice, but if you string a whole episode out of them (which, save for the last 5 minutes, this one did), it's too much, and the whole thing feels fake and off and manipulative. Same problem with making the Doctor too quirky and fast-talking and ridiculous - it's better in small doses.

It's a Christmas episode and obviously aimed at kids, so we all shrug and move on. But as a regular season episode? This isn't really what we all tune in to Who to see, I think. 

The last Christmas episode was similar, and had a lot of story/continuity/rules of time travel problems - but the story was much more solid and grounded in a relatable character arc and had better narrative, so the audience is more willing to overlook it (IMO).",0,1324996481,null,0,false,0,c3bj6zy,t3_npoza,t1_c3bj6zy,t1_c3b516y,1428082100,7,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,7

There is no way that reallocating resources in this manner will benefit those who do not pay directly for their healthcare, and to me it suggests an underhand way of reducing opposition from doctors and the healthcare profession through attempting to bring them on board by promising they can generate more revenue from private work, in turn increasing their wages. The kind of thing I personally expect people who don't understand the value of the NHS would attempt.

It flies in the face of the original ideals behind the NHS, of universal healthcare for all. This creates a two-tier system where half the hospital and resources are for paying, first-class customers and the other half are the 'freeriders'.

Good point.  If you can get away with being a sole trader then it is a lot easier.  However, you should also bear in mind the risks.  

As a sole trader you can be sued for damages and *personally* held liable for any debts.  With a limited company you could, in the worst case, lose the company and all its assets but you would at least get to keep your house, car and other personal property.  Either way you should have public liability insurance and possibly also professional indemnity insurance to avoid the worst case scenario.

The other benefit of a limited company is that people tend to take you more seriously.  More so if you're also VAT registered.

Hahaha.  Right.  Except that those NHS services will now only be available to NHS patients for half the time so waiting times will be roughly twice as long.  Or if you don't want to wait you can pay (or have your insurance company pay) and jump to the front of the queue to use the same NHS facilities, but ""privately"".  In which case the PCT will cancel the NHS operation they had planned for tomorrow and fit you in instead.  They'll keep on doing this (because earning more money is *good* for the NHS, right?) until they've used up their 49% quota and then, only then, will the NHS patients get a look in.

When the NHS was created, the average lifespan was lower and the number and types of treatments it could offer were relatively minimal. Free healthcare for all who need it was a manageable thing. Over the past few decades we've seen a ballooning in the treatments available, a postcode lottery and back door privatisation.

There needs to be a proper re-evaluation of what the NHS does and doesn't do, and how it does it.

On there you will be able to get to the London Eye, the German and other cultural market stalls and the Tate Modern. There are also some brilliant restaurants along that stretch.

true,onbetamax,uk,Sheffield,"A few months ago I spent a month and a half in Toronto. There are a few things I noticed that were quite interesting. (I have no idea where in Toronto you're from but this might help)

Firstly, waitress service in bars - Don't expect it here in the UK in most places. Our barman/barmaids get paid badly, and we DON'T tip them. It is not as nearly a desirable job here as it is there. Because of this, you go to the bar and get your own beer (and don't be rude to them either. I've worked in a bar, and if someone is rude, they won't put up with it because they are waiting for a tip. No tips mean they just won't serve you.)
Speaking of Alcohol, its MUCH easier to get here. You'll enjoy that ;)

Secondly, even in Toronto, people are friendly compared to here (I know Torontonians have a bad reputation in Canada). Don't be offended if people are rude in London. It's kind of the same deal that Londoners tend to be more rude than the rest of the UK. 

Thirdly, in Toronto, if you are walking down the street and need to cross the road at a junction, you just step out and the cars will wait (Unless its a main road of course). DO NOT DO THIS IN LONDON. You put a foot on the road without the lights being on red or it being a Zebra crossing and you will get flattened. Be careful.

Finally, use your accent, it will help in making friends, but don't be offended if everyone thinks your American. I will apologise in advance for this. Also I apologise for my country if you are offended by bad language. We're not to an Irish/Australian level, but you'll probably hear a lot more Fucks thrown into every day conversation than back in Canada (This is just personal experience though, so maybe this was just something I experienced).
Hope you have a great time here though! best to stay SW rather than SE. Welcome to our country!

true,aussie_gecko1892,null,null,"SORRY, FOR SOME REASON MY THOUGHTS WERE NOT POSTED WITH IT. THIS IS WHAT I THINK.

OK, so I have been hearing a lot of people go on about how Liverpool is just not good enough at the moment and how terible we are, especially those against Andy Carrol. I want to post my opinion, and then hear yours.

Firstly on the team as a whole and the results we have been happening. I fell the answer to our form is simple, confidence, we don't have enough of it. At the beginning of the season we brought in many different players in many roles, including Stewart Downing, Charlie Adam, Jordan Henderson and Craig Bellamy (I haven't heared much about Jose Enrique and personally I think he is playing really well). these players are all in the middle of the park and have to work well together to be a better team. at the moment, there connection is good, but not as good as it could be, and I think it is due to lack of confidence in not only the team, but themselves.

take Stewart Downing, he is a great wide man, gets to the line, holds the ball up, and can hit a ball (just summary qualities). however, he has not scored for liverpool, because of this, his confidence has to be down and he is not playing at his best. I really feel people need to get off of his back and give the guy some encouragement, he needs a goal, he needs confidence. this can be said for everyone really from the midfield up. Liverpool have the best defensive record in the league, however we have one of the worst scoring records, and that is where we need to improve, but that will not come with new players in at the transfer window, but with the team pulling together, sticking to it, and getting the goals.

As for Andy Carrol, he is a great player. people are saying he is the worst 35million dollar player ever, and personally, i think not. firstly, on that money factor, with no time to debate to get Newcastles main striker in a few days needed direct money, and with Torres for 50million, we could afford it. however people are not seeing that and so he has to bear that price tag with everyone saying he is bad and not worth it. that does not help. once again i must say that his confidence is down, and he just needs to get it back. as for carrol as a player, he is fantastic, and for anyone who knows anything about football, might just agree with me that he is not as skillful, but a more active version of Berbatov. he holds up the play well, releases it when he needs. has good vision, can strike it well, puts pressure on the defence more that a lot of forwards, can head the ball and has good movement off the ball. however, fo those who dont know the game that well, they dont see this, so they think he is crap. he is not, i can tell you that.

i would also like to point out that even though Carrol is tall, does not mean that Liverpool has to play the ball in the air to him all the time, he is good with his feet and we need to recognize that.

one last thing, Luiz Suarez is a good player, very skillful, good vision and just good on most counts. where he fails is in his slight lack of teamwork and holding the ball up. sometimes i feel that instead of taking on the man to find the shot, suarez could just knock it back. he has had way to many shots, not enough of target, adn less go in. yes he is good, but if he can calm down just that little bit, not always try to find the smallest gap and just go backwards instead of forwards all the time, we might be better off.

so basically i put down our lack of scoring, and not being able to finish off games to confidence, and thats it.

true,langsea24,null,null,"I think we are fooling ourselves saying that we need to buy anyone in the next transfer window. It might actually be the worst possible thing we could do now, even with Suarez being banned. We bought so many last window that they haven't had the proper amount of time for total cohesion of playing style. It's unrealistic to believe that an instantaneous increase of winning statistics would materialise when most of our midfield and frontmen had never played together before this season. I would put our lack of goals down to lack of cohesion and this can only be increased through increased play time. You add more new signings and you only decrease the current cohesive play and decrease our chances of scoring. 

Look at our defensive line and GK: best in the league and this is because 4/5ths have been playing together for many seasons. While Enrique has taken up the challenge of molding well with the rest of our defense, I think that comes mostly from having that cohesion already in place from previous seasons. 

What we need is more time and not more signings. I think those LFC fans out there that discredit our current team and have requested for unrealistic signings in the next window are fans that lack the passion for the team and for the game.

You've probably seen this quote a lot this campaign but here it is again: ""If you can't support us when we draw or lost, don't support us when we win."" -- Shankly. To me, saying we absolutely have to sign someone in the next window is not showing your support for the current squad. We may not be where we want to be, but if you can't see that we have been improving then you are blind to the actual game.

true,binlargin,eng-lancashire,Lancashire,"IR35 can fuck you if you're not careful, it applies to each contract you take.

You need to make sure that:

1. You're not getting the same benefits that a permanent employee would get and a visitor wouldn't. For example this could be access to a gym, cafeteria, parking space and so on.
2. You are providing a *service*, not a person. In practice this means having a replacement clause in your contract, where you can send someone else with the same skills in your place.
3. You aren't being told when to turn up and leave. If you're expected to be in the office 9:00 til 5:30 or need a sick note for not turning in then you're fucked.

If you pass all of these then you're exempt from IR35, which means you pay employer's NI on the wage you pay yourself rather than on the money paid directly to your company, and take the rest in dividends (wife on minimum wage plus 50% of dividends, rent your home office to your company and so on)

Also keep in mind that it's not a matter of the contract, it's about the actual practice. If your contract dodges IR35 but in practice you're acting like a permanent employee then you'll probably lose if it ever goes to court.

If you're caught out then you will be fined 100% of what you owe, plus you have to pay back the tax, plus court costs etc. So if you work for a year and save £20k because you dodged IR35, you'll have to pay that plus £20k in fines, plus court costs; it will cost you about £50k.

First of all, it's the Christmas special so it has to include some ""Christmas miracle"" element in it, that's the goddamn point of it. Second, the people complaining about Moffat are the people who were fine with Davies turning the show into a soap for people who were horny for Tennant. I disagree with people who think that the whole Bad Wolf/something on your back thing was so brilliant, it's really not that clever and it's tedious, especially when Moffat did it all once again with the cracks. And the complaint about the few character traits and mentioning Sally Sparrow and Madame de Pompadour as counter examples seems ridiculous to me, since Pompadour seems to me to have only one trait, which was repeated ad nauseam in the Davies tenure (girl falls in love with the Doctor, this only brings her misery and Tennant looks into the horizon), and the only thing that they seem to concentrate on is that they are portrayed as being ""badass"" without any real development to back it up. And the other complaint that OP brings up is as non-valid. Just how many ""Anyone else want to see more of this guy?"" posts were there during season 6? Canton III, Commander Strax, Madame Vastra and Jenny, Dorium Maldovar, Vincent van Gogh, Rita, Idris, Craig, Lorna, etc... Those are all secondary characters that at least 1 viewer got to care about. As for the episode, it was fine, in my opinion it was great. The visuals were pretty good, and in the beginning the special  effects were as cheesy as they are supposed to be in Doctor Who, but later on got really good. I really like that alluding to classic literature seems to be the Christmas tradition now. There's always a purpose for each character in any show, and the ones in this episode did their job just fine. The boy was there to be curious and irresponsible so they'd get thrown into the major situation. People can't really complain about that when we had episodes like Midnight, where everyone there was only there to be reduced into a frightened mob. I liked the girl's character, and I really liked that she reminded me of the older Dunphy daughter from Modern Family mostly in the beginning. I like that this special seems to be as much as a one-liner gold mine as the last one. Mostly, I like the show, I think the current one is definitely the best Doctor out of the new ones, and for me the show keeps getting better even thought it's really not aimed at me, which encourages me to stop overreacting when in the end, what I'd be about to do is complain about being disappointed with a children's television show.

The moment when Madge had the ability to drive a gigantic futuristic walker because she once was in a plane with her husband just lost me. I felt this episode was very much a Dr Who episode for kids, which isn't always terrible as kids enjoy Dr Who loads as well. But, usually Moffat is able to write episodes that everyone can enjoy but i thought this one in particular was just pandering to the audience. 
Even though there have been several bumps in the quality of Dr Who episodes of late, ""Lets Kill Hitler"" and the other episodes which started the second half of season 6 were terrible i'm sorry. I hope Moffat stops phoning it in, i remember how much wit and intelligence he can write with. Maybe he was focusing on Sherlock and Tintin too much.

Also, it would be best if this was done as a surprise regeneration - the current actor wouldn't announce that they were leaving, and the new actor would only be credited as his fake character during that season.

Rather than these beings learning our language, it's probably more likely that the Doctor's influence throughout the Earth's history caused us to learn it.

* Martín Montoya (20), a speedy right back who defends well and can push forward, he also recently debuted for the Spain NT despite being a Segunda Division player (Barça B), which is very rare; and 

* Alberto Botía (22) a big (187 cm) CB who has been on loan at Sporting de Gijón for the last two seasons and has been a starter on Spain U21.

Those three young players would greatly improve any team. All of them are long time La Masía players, who deserve to be on big clubs, but have not had space on Barcelona's first team because of the tremendous quality ahead of them.

The Doctor and Jack flirting, and especially that kiss (the Doctor sure didn't mind, look at his expression!)

Sure they aren't the world's best company (and for every example of someone living in $country with 10000Gbit broadband, there's an example of someone in a rural part of that country with a worse service than we have), but thanks to privatisation (and allowing competition) we have a highly competitive industry with low prices and better availablity (no waiting lists).

I have no complaints about the National Grid or the local distribution network operators either (the ""issue"" with energy costs is a matter for politicians and crippling taxes/feed in tariffs/green subsidies and those who generate the electricity, not the distributor).

The water company for where I live has spent billions ripping out ancient plumbing and replacing it with new stuff, and have also helped greatly to improve our beaches and rivers. We haven't had a hosepipe ban since the 90s and no real issues with water quality to speak of.

It's very strange to say that all privatisation must be good or that it all must be bad. It works well for some industries and not for others. Certainly, at least in the way it was privatised (instead of a monolithic ""BR plc"" like Deutsche Bahn are), it hasn't been too great for our railway network. 

But remember that a lot of the management of the network lies at the feet of our wonderful politicians. They decide what Network Rail is going to spend money on (i.e. what'll get the most votes in a few years' time), they decide what trains the train companies can use, what trains they're allowed to buy (look at the Intercity Express shambles - we can't just buy trains, there has to be a politically motivated programme with lots of red tape to get them), what routes they can run, how much they can charge, almost everything is micromanaged by the Department for Transport.

We did, after all, survive with a privately owned railway industry for decades (up until nationalisation in the 1940s).

And about trying classic, start like this:

First of all, watch the first one, An Unearthly Child (just part 1). You need to know where things started. And then watch Genesis of the Daleks.

I had tried to watch classic many times, failing with four different stories. Until I watched Genesis, then I began hopping all over classic. Now I've seen all of it and am onto the radio dramas. So watch Genesis, and then go chronological. Or you can try dabbling by watching the best of each Doctor, in which case...

**William Hartnell, first**- The beginnings of the series. It needs forgiveness as it's very slow, and the Doctor is kind of a jerk at first, but there are some stories I really like. The Aztecs. It's a historical. Something DW doesn't do anymore.

**Patrick Troughton, second** - Patrick Troughton is basically Matt Smith, but in the '60s. He's all silly/bumbly, but don't let that fool you, he kicks butt. His run is mostly missing thanks to the BBC but there are reconstructions. And they also suffer from '60s slowness. Watch: The Mind Robber. Tomb of the Cybermen. And if you can do reconstructions: Power of the Daleks. And the War Games last.

**Jon Pertwee, third**- A weird run as most stories are on Earth (for story reasons explained). You meet the Master. This is when things really start to modernize and feel like they were made in the 20th century. Spearhead from Space, his first story. Inferno starts a little slow but picks up when the Doctor ends up in an alternate universe where everyone is evil. Like that Star Trek story. The Time Warrior introduces the famous companion Sarah Jane. Curse of Peladon, The Three Doctors, Day of the Daleks and last Planet of the Spiders are also good.

**Tom Baker, fourth** The most famous run. This is when the writing enters a higher standard in Doctor Who. There are so many fantastic stories, and it's the run in which Genesis of the Daleks occurs. One of the most famous classic stories, and the one that got me into classic (above). So I say Genesis of the Daleks, Robots of Death, Face of Evil, Warrior's Gate, Deadly Assassin (for Time Lord history if anything), Horror of Fang Rock, Sunmakers, and of course lastly Logopolis.

**Peter Davison, fifth** -Earthshock, Castrovalva (2nd half picks up), Kinda, Snakedance, Mawdryn Undead, Terminus, and Enlightenment. And The Five Doctors, which is the 25th anniversary special. EDIT: wait, how could I forget Caves of Androzani?! The last 5th Doctor story.

**Colin Baker, sixth** - Just want to say, Colin got fired. Poor guy. His Doctor is a drastic change with the flamboyant technicolor dreamcoat and bombastic crazy personality. If you can get used to him, he cracks you up and makes you laugh. He's a bit abrasive but so is the first doctor. His best is easily Vengance on Varos and Attack of the Cybermen, and Revelation of the Daleks. And if you want to try Trial of a Timelord (which is an entire season) it's pretty good. The Vervoid one is the weakest story I think. The sixth is the most underappreciated and maybe disliked Doctor. People say his era is crap, so when I went into it I was worried but pleasantly surprised. Because his era is NOT crap, it's only got a couple real stinkers, like any run does.

**Sylvester McCoy, seventh**. Personally, my favorite Doctor. This is easy. Remembrance of the Daleks, The Curse of Fenric, The Greatest Show in the Galaxy, Battlefield. Good mention to The Happiness Patrol, Ghost Light, Silver Nemesis. This is the era where they really try some crazy radical stories.

true,TLKv3,null,null,"I figured I would slowly suffer from the downvote oblivion of the Moffat fans but that comes with a different opinion. Not saying you're wrong, but to me Moffat is horrible.

And for the record, Moffat is ""Showrunner"". Which means HE has the final say in every written creative direction the show takes. HE decides the hierarchy of the actual Series' plot. HE decides what should happen in each episode to dictate the future endgame. HE approved of lazily copping out and deciding to reboot time and space TWICE in a row in order to write himself out of a corner.

One day I honestly hope that every current Whovian who thinks Moffat is some form of God incarnate for this show gives their head a shake. Moffat has done nothing with this show but make it the River Song Show since the moment Series 5 began. You realize since Series 5, about 10-12 episodes all had River Song as a character right? Most of the time as the main focus point? She's had an entire Series worth of episodes just to in the end say ""I'd change time to save you, screw the rest of reality, I love you forever and ever Doctor."" Seriously? You think THAT is a creative and unique vision for a show about a time traveling alien?

And, while we're on the topic. You used a WRITTEN LINE from the show to explain Moffat's showrunning actions. That's like if George Lucas wrote Luke Skywalker a line in the very last movie saying ""This whole time was just dumb luck."" It's the most obvious thing pointed out about something that should never need explaining. Worst of all, it's the writer/showrunner who APPROVED that line in the first place you're trying to defend. HE wrote that line for The Doctor to say, The Doctor didn't just come up with it on his own.

Moffat has been nothing but a fanfiction writer with the permission to do what he wants with a show that deserves better.

&gt;In Doctor Who, it is established that due to their alien biology, Time Lords such as the Doctor can survive in the vacuum of space without the need for external protection.
However, while Time Lords do not need space suits, they still need oxygen to breathe. There was one notable instance in which the Fifth Doctor had to go outside a ship into the vacuum of space, but all he took with him was an oxygen tank from a medical kit. Other episodes establish that Time Lords have a ""respiratory bypass"", which allows them to survive being strangled. Its not clear if this means a Time Lord can survive for even longer periods in space, although they would be unconscious (whereas the Fifth Doctor needed to repair something on the outside of the ship so he had to stay conscious, so he took oxygen with him).",0,1325026406,null,0,false,0,c3bnfsw,t3_nsdrg,t1_c3bnfsw,t1_c3bmk2h,1428084090,3,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,3

true,codine,uk,United Kingdom,"Sure - start off by reading this link [here - bbc news.](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-11762636) The metaphorical shit hit the fan for the UK Govt when the Court of Appeal rejected ministers' pleas to hear secret evidence in closed courts.  This meant that should the UK wish to accuse someone of Terrorism, then the accused *would have the right to face their accuser in court*, as frankly is correct and fitting in a modern, civilized state.

However, since the majority of evidence against these accused originates from the USA, this means that anyone accused of terrorism in the UK can say 'Ok, who's saying that, and I'd like my defense to ask them some questions thankyouverymuch!'.  

That scenario was enough to make the CIA and FBI recoil in horror - there is no way in hell the CIA is going to stand up in a foreign court and make accusations *and worse, be asked questions about how/where the information came from*.  

Worse (for the Govt) however was the danger that while the CIA might easily refuse to turn up in a UK court, the UK intelligence agencies (MI5-6, etc) could *not* refuse, and the danger there was with them stating under oath 'The information came from the USA via method A,B etc etc'.



Thus, the USA flat out refused to play ball with the UK Govt and started threatening to withhold future information, and the UK Govt, finally backed into a corner they could not wiggle out of, are 'forced' to pay millions in compensation to people who had been locked up, tortured and denied a trial for years.  *Anything* to keep them out of court where the whole sordid affair would see the light of day.

However, getting back to the original issue, there is a 'nice' fall back plan already tucked away in 2003, UK's 2003 extradition agreement with the USA.  Using the 2003 agreement there is 'no need' at all for the UK or the USA to have an embarrassing situation in a UK court, since the UK Govt. can simply just put them on a plane to the USA, and wave their hands helplessly saying '*well, it's in the treaty, we have little choice'*.

&gt;McKinnon could have been prosecuted here and face justice but the Americans don't want that; they want to destroy him

Wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong. If you want to know why in detail see [here](http://jackofkent.blogspot.com/2010/06/skeptic-looks-at-mckinnon-case-part-two.html). In short, the CPS just did not have the evidence to successfully prosecute and it wasn't until quite far through the proceedings that McKinnon seemed willing to plead guilty, by which time it was arguably too late. The idea that this is just a case of the US trying to destroy someone who broke their security is completely ignoring the severity of the crime and the entire proceedings that has led up to where the case is now.

If I could make every person in the UK read Jack of Kent's wonderful series on the proceedings I would. Not only to make the general legal process a bit clearer, but also to get rid of this complete and utter ignorance, perpetuated by the Daily Mail &amp; Co campaign against extradition, about what is actually going on.

Edit: I should also add that as the ultimate parent comment said, this is nothing like McKinnon. From my limited understanding of it, the O'Dwyer case appears to be essentially a case of the US claiming international jurisdiction (which some would argue doesn't exist). The McKinnon case is absolutely within the US jurisdiction and would require extradition with any reasonable extradition treaty.

Edit 2: It also turns out that my original post, in which I claimed that McKinnon turned down a quite favourable deal in which he would have been able to serve the vast majority of his sentence in the UK was correct.

In my opinion, he's making a classic error which is to compare apples and oranges.  The two incarnations of the show (classic and ""NuWho"") are totally different beasts and don't necessarily stand up to the comparisons he was throwing at them.

Personally, I find classic Doctor Who to be old-fashioned, tedious and poorly made.  But, and here's an important point, that's because I didn't watch it as a child.  I suspect he's looking at it with a pair of rose-tinted glasses and thinking how much better it was when he was a nipper.

As I've enjoyed NuWho so much, I decided to watch a couple of classic stories:  The Dæmons and The Pirate Planet.  I made it all the way through The Dæmons but found it to be far too long.  What occurred in five episodes could have been comfortably done in two or three.  As for The Pirate Planet, I didn't even make it to the end.  This will be seen as sacrilege, I know, but it simply wasn't worth the effort I was putting in to watching it.

Conversely, one of the criticisms I'd level at the current Doctor Who is that sometimes it's just too damn fast!  Occasionally, it'll whip along at such breakneck speed that I find myself wishing they'd slow it down a little and take their time telling the story.  A happy medium would be nice.

I think that Moffat has done good things for Doctor Who.  Of course, some episodes are rather forgettable, but others have been fantastic.

Would Doctor Who benefit from some tighter writing at times?  Yes.  Would it benefit from a bigger budget?  Undoubtedly.  Has Moffat completely ruined it?  Absolutely not.

&gt;If you want to throw out adhoc arguments for/against privatisation, here's another one: BT.
Sure they aren't the world's best company (and for every example of someone living in $country with 10000Gbit broadband, there's an example of someone in a rural part of that country with a worse service than we have), but thanks to privatisation (and allowing competition) we have a highly competitive industry with low prices and better availablity (no waiting lists).
I have no complaints about the National Grid or the local distribution network operators either (the ""issue"" with energy costs is a matter for politicians and crippling taxes/feed in tariffs/green subsidies and those who generate the electricity, not the distributor).
The water company for where I live has spent billions ripping out ancient plumbing and replacing it with new stuff, and have also helped greatly to improve our beaches and rivers. We haven't had a hosepipe ban since the 90s and no real issues with water quality to speak of.
It's very strange to say that all privatisation must be good or that it all must be bad. It works well for some industries and not for others. Certainly, at least in the way it was privatised (instead of a monolithic ""BR plc"" like Deutsche Bahn are), it hasn't been too great for our railway network.
But remember that a lot of the management of the network lies at the feet of our wonderful politicians. They decide what Network Rail is going to spend money on (i.e. what'll get the most votes in a few years' time), they decide what trains the train companies can use, what trains they're allowed to buy (look at the Intercity Express shambles - we can't just buy trains, there has to be a politically motivated programme with lots of red tape to get them), what routes they can run, how much they can charge, almost everything is micromanaged by the Department for Transport.
We did, after all, survive with a privately owned railway industry for decades (up until nationalisation in the 1940s). No one can deny that the likes of Brunel and the GWR (and others) weren't at the forefront of innovation.

On a side note having a condom break isn't rape here.

The 2003 extradition law Blair passed was not thoroughly thought through. Even the American Government thinks it's unconstitutional and thus won't sign it.

The most worrying part of this is that as a citizen of this country I assumed I had the protection of the police, courts and foreign office. But it looks like I am subject to the laws of another country, a country that will not extend their constitution to me and is known to be extremely corrupt.
If a British man was extradited to Iran for calling the prophet Mohamed a paedophile, the whole nation would be outraged. Yet some how an equally ridiculous case involving an equally corrupt state is going on with almost no public uproar.

I hope this lad is not extradited, who knows what will happen if they get hold of him. There are people serving multiple century long sentences over there.

true,unhOLINess,tardis,TARDIS,"When exactly in my post did I ever say that RTD was a better writer overall? My complaint was that Moffat did not live up to the episodes he's written in the past.

I worded the section on ""flat"" characters poorly, and I think I'm using the wrong term, but just so we're clear on definitions:    
A flat character, in my opinion, is one who has a small set of defining character traits, whose thoughts aren't really explored, and who doesn't change throughout the episode.    
A round character, contrariwise, is one who the view genuinely can sympathize with, whose way of thinking is explored more intimately, and who either changes or has more of themselves revealed throughout the episode.

The point that you made about the overabundance of ""DAE want to see more of _____"" is precisely what I'm talking about. Moffat has had a tendency lately to throw in characters with no intention of developing them at all. They are simply present to show off they're initial character trait(s) and be off. Thin one, Fat one, Canton III, Madame Vastra and Jenny are perfect examples of this. This episode, unfortunately, was a perfect example of the fact that, when characters like these really are fleshed out, there isn't a whole lot more depth to them. 



Finally, I would disagree that Madame de Pompadour had only one defining character trait. The Girl in the Fireplace is my second favorite episode precisely because of her character. ",0,1325034145,null,0,false,0,c3bojud,t3_nsdrg,t1_c3bojud,t1_c3bl22k,1428084627,4,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,4

Don't be surprised if the path leads across someone's front lawn, but remember that this is one of the situations where you do smile and say hello.

You mentioned bureaucrats: difficult to give specific advice, but I've almost always found that the ones working for central govt (e.g. tax) are helpful and pleasant to deal with.

Mobile phones: these are usually either by direct debit or prepay and should be cheaper than you are used to. If you move companies, you can take the number with you (for contract phones - not sure about prepay).

Internet access: ADSL is cheap, and there probably over a hundred ISPs. However most of them will require that you have a BT landline phone as well. Cable is often an alternative, depending on where you live.

Etiquette: with a foreign accent, you can get away with anything (even talking on the tube). Just don't try to start a conversation in a gent's lavatory.

Any aspect of the show has some flaws, but I think this person has taken the issues of Doctor Who under Moffat and blown them out of proportion.

Also, we've got to consider the differences between today and the times of classic Who. We've got a very broad audience to pander to. Doctor Who always has, but now it's larger than ever. With the technology of today, Doctor Who can pretty much go worldwide to all ages. It's a lot safer to stick to consistently good stories than to try a hit-and-miss routine of the 80's. This is purely a budget thing, not a failure in writing.

Plus, audiences are a *lot* less tolerant of bad special effects, so a lot of radical ideas are off the table- like Planet of the Giants with Hartnell. A classic sci-fi cliche, but one only explored twice in DW's whole history. (*well* more like four times a bit sort of but not really)

As for exalting stories like Talons and Carnival of Monsters, they were good, but not *that* good. Carnival definitely had a good twist and concept, but the outside events of the so called revolution weren't really developed that well. Talons is something that I liked, but lacked the big punch to really make the story a top in my book. And I know I'll get slammed for this, but I didn't really like The Pirate Planet.

I can say though that I'm glad someone had the guts to post up a very controversial opinion and challenge some ideas. The author of the blog has points but they don't warrant the kind of reaction I'm reading.

Let's also take note here people: It's pretty much an axiom of fandom that the current show runner will take all the flak for any and all flaws a fan may find in the show.

I received your reply in the fortunate location of a bookstore which had the Keynes book. From what I understand, economics is my weakest subject. I feel that I have a very strong understanding in politics, a mild understanding of philosophy, but a very limited understanding of academic economics.

Do you feel that admissions to Oxford is based more off of what the student knows and their passion for the topic, vs. having all A's on the a-level?

Edit: I've found reading lists for each of the three branches, but they require an Oxford login.

Edit 2: I found another reading list that doesn't require a log in. http://www.ppe.ox.ac.uk/index.php/how-to-prepare-for-ppe

true,PupinTheTurd,tardis,TARDIS,"Everyone is entitled to their own opinion I guess. I don't think for a moment that Moffat is perfect but I've been enjoying his tenure more than RTD's. A lot of that comes down to Matt Smith and a lot of it comes down to River Song (who I enjoy watching).

My main issues with RTD was the over use of the Daleks and the fact that every finale had to be bigger and more epic than the previous. Which frankly got a little tiresome, it would be nice to see a finale that doesn't rely on the universe or time being riven from whatever mechanism is being used this time.
Moffat seems to have fallen into that trap somewhat. But I'm not sure how to take it because upon looking back on the last two seasons it seems to be that Moffat spent two seasons undoing everything RTD did.

* Season 1 - He resets the universe
* Season 2 - He resets the Doctor (which I'm all for I do feel he got a little too rockstar).

So did he fall into this trap in order to commit a reset and perhaps we will see something new from here or not?

I grew up watching Tom Baker's doctor, my wife and I enjoy watching the older stuff. And as mentioned else where in this thread they do drag things out sometimes and things that take five episodes to do could have been done in two or three. There are elements (like the Key to Time series) that I liked, it's about stopping a big bad but it doesn't go epic! Epic! EPIC! like some of the newer stuff has.

Well, that's what we're here for. I'm someone who LOVES Matt Smith's take, was thoroughly done with Tennant and count my second favorite as the 9th doc (the 4th tops the list) and *I think this episode was lackluster.*

They can't all be block busters but it was tame even by Christmas standards, with no human anchor-- the mother didn't have the charisma or the writing to carry this episode. The Doctor's lines were brilliant, the kids weren't too annoying but the whole thing felt ruddarless and lacking in liveliness. 

As usual, we start with a burst, lose energy by the middle and at the end all that build up didn't hit the climax we were expecting. Sounds like the MO for this showrunner.

I thought Eccleston did a good job of showing that he loved her and couldn't be with out her.

I don't think the Swedish prosecution are arguing that all that happened is the condom broke.

The second thing I'm less sure of. Why should it matter what the law is here, when Assange was very much in Sweden? When you enter a country do you not agree to abide by their laws?

I'm less sure of this, because lots of countries have ridiculous and unjust laws, but I do think a country should be permitted to make its own laws---democratically of course---and even quite restrictive ones if it thinks it needs them to reduce rapes, and then ask people who visit it to abide by them if they choose to enter that country.",0,1325046828,null,0,true,0,c3bqd0i,t3_nsnmt,t1_c3bqd0i,t1_c3bod8c,1428085530,4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,4

true,pork2001,null,null,"A key problem for me with Moffat is that he misuses the genre. I'll explain: professional authors in the world of imagination differentiate between science fiction, science fantasy, and straight fantasy. Science fiction deep down is based on logic; you set a believable premise and then move ahead based on it. That premise must be rational and not supernatural. In fantasy, the premise can be supernatural and can be unconnected to the real world. And then there's the bastard child, science-fantasy. It uses the trappings of science and the irrationality of fantasy. And THAT is the domain Moffat has taken the Doctor into. His stories completely rely on irrational premises. 

Moffat's stories are fundamentally dishonest, and cloaked in melodrama. He flings events out without any rational justification even with suspension of disbelief. When he features fleshless skulls chomping on a villain, weeping angels made of stone that mobilizes when you don't look at it, and endless technobabble, it ruins the story for me. Moffat is neither fish nor fowl, neither real science fiction nor straight fantasy. His season ender featuring time stopped at a little after five - if time has stopped enough that clocks don't run, well, hearts aren't going to beat, legs aren't going to move; it either needs to be frozen, or active. Not a bastard mix. His work is full of handwaving, and that's why I don't like him.

What Moffat is skilled at is creating melodrama, but the route he takes to achieve it is to throw all believability out the window.

I guess it's our blessing that the way he's been playing can be considered ""under form,"" but I do agree that something has to change. I don't think dropping him is the solution, though. The simple fact of the matter is that other players who could play up top, Kuyt, Carroll, Bellamy for example, just aren't going to create those chances. They all have their uses, but chance creating isn't what I would call it. Until Gerrard is back to being a regular in the squad when he gets the injury fully behind him, Suarez is truly the only creative player out there. That's another issue entirely, but I don't think taking out the most potentially dangerous player we have at the moment is the solution.

I also agree that he tends to be a little wasteful, so hopefully we bring in somebody clinical in January to partner him. That'll be a different sight.

Yes, Rose's relationship with the Doctor was powerful (and I really wish Moffat would let that show but he wants to keep his Doctor seperate but that's a whole other issue I have with him) but I think 11 is feeling relationships more powerfully. While 10 certainly possessed powerful emotions, as all the Doctors do, (and Tennant expressed those emotions damn well,) 11 is more emotional and much more a child at heart. I think part of this was the Doctor's desire to both separate himself more from his own emotions but be closer to others which is conflicting, but 11 is full of contradictions.

true,Outgraber,troughton,Troughton,"   A very interesting article that made me think but I hardly think Steven Moffat has ruined Doctor Who. He has his strengths and weaknesses. His many mysteries had me awaiting each episode with breath baited, he is a master of dialogue and has a tremendous imagination but his character development is wanting. Virtual quantum characters pop in and out of existence and it's all tremendously exciting but it sometimes seems like dessert all the time. 
   I haven't viewed all of the old Whos (I'm in season 16) but I don't think they compare to the reboot as far as writing goes. I have enjoyed them but I think the new Who is an improvement. The only thing I don't like about the new Who is the Doctor's increasing omnipotence and the Tardis'. The Doctor's Tardis was originally just one of many and an outmoded model at that but lately it seems to be able to do just about anything including help reboot the universe. 
   The great thing about this article is it has people thinking and reexamining which is a good thing since we have a long wait for more.

You suggest that my opinion is flawed because I've only watched two classic Who stories.  What do you think is the optimum number of classic Who stories that I should watch in order to be allowed to formulate an opinion?  4?  8?  12 and a half?  Or are there very specific episodes that I simply have to watch before my opinion can be regarded as worthy of consideration?

&gt;Saying the only reason someone could like the original show better is because of childhood nostalgia...is a poor way to make any sort of argument. And in this case it's demonstrably wrong because there are people right here who've discovered original Doctor Who as adults, even within the past year or two, and absolutely love it.

Well that's all fine and dandy, except I'm not talking about other people, just the guy who wrote the blog post.  What I actually said was, ""I suspect he's looking at it with a pair of rose-tinted glasses"".  You see?  It was a suspicion, based on what I've read from the guy.  For me to read one blog post and then make a sweeping generalisation about ALL classic Who fans would be utterly ridiculous and deserving of scorn.  It's a good job, then, that I didn't.  You may disagree with my opinion, but please don't put words in my mouth.

In an [earlier post](http://richardhcooper.blogspot.com/2010/05/doctor-who-forest-of-weeds-and-roses.html) of his he said, ""My reaction at the phrase “beyond redemption” was “WHOAA!” Surely the show I’ve followed all my life wasn’t that bad?""  That suggests to me that, yes, this is a show he's watched since he was a child and, accordingly, has PERHAPS taken on that patina of an innocent time when summer seemed to never end, and there was always another Tom Baker adventure to watch on the TV.

I challenge the BBC to run one of the classic Who serials on BBC1 at peak time and see what people make of it.  I suspect that opinion would be widely divided amongst the adults, but I'd be really surprised if today's generation of children were remotely interested in it.

true,LokianEule,mccoy,Time's Champion,"First I have to ask- is this your first episode of Doctor Who *ever*? Because you know that this was 1974 and nowadays in 2005-2011+ that the show isn't like that?

Okay, first of all, Davros is pretty much in power. There's a council of twelve sure, but really, I think that everyone knows (and it's well established) that Davros has them under his thumb. That being said, you don't want to go against the guy who makes all the weapons.

Second, if you're really meaning the Kaleds and not the Thals, that's because they've been in a 1000 year war of attrition. Nowadays on Skaro, everybody uses propaganda, everybody kills each other and thinks nothing of it. The society of Skaro is supposed to be modeled on Nazi Germany really. I mean the soldiers are even wearing Iron Crosses in the unedited version.

The ""intelligent aliens"" thing was just to catch our attention. For one thing, we know he's wrong in the context of the show, and second, who is this Davros who claims he knows everything eh? I think it's time we meet him! The Doctor had a mission to do, he wasn't going to try and discuss intelligent aliens with Davros, he had to stop some from coming into existence.

Sure repeatability. But this is sci-fi and we stretch it a bit. It wasn't so much about being for science as for survival. That's what Davros is all about, survival. And Davros is supposed to be the smartest being in the universe (excluding the Doctor). His work is supposed to be revolutionary and beyond everyone else. They may be all sciencey in Skaro, but really, it was just about winning the war and ensuring survival. Hang science! We need the practical.

As for the final form of the Daleks, the main contention the characters start having with Davros later in the story is that after they develop the final form of the Daleks, Davros starts to alter it even more, removing emotion and any sense of morality (not like the Kaleds had much of one to begin with).

And one last thing: Are you referring to the Daleks when you say ""ridiculous robot""?

-Yes, these were the first two episodes I've ever watched. I realize that the series is probably higher budget and whatnot in the reboot, but from what I gathered the 4th doctor seemed to be the most iconic, so I figured I'd get the best feel for the show from that series.

-1) I was referring to the bit where he introduces the ""destroy everything"" button (which interestingly enough was actually a ""destory everything"" button. At that point I was fully expecting someone to try and push it only to realize it's a fake)

2) good point, but that still doesn't explain why the Kaled remnants didn't give a shit that there were basically &lt;100 of them left. Also, would anyone really be expecting an end to the stalemate?

3) good point. Still, it was a bit annoying

4) Yeah, but still: he could have revived the Dalek project and the Doctor should have realized that when he was destroying the nursery.

-I was referring to the episode ""Robot"", you know the one where someone's Halloween costume wreaks havoc.

true,LokianEule,mccoy,Time's Champion,"Oh, well Genesis kind of is quintessential *classic* Who for all it's flaws. It's probably padded two episodes longer than it should be, but it has Daleks and wrote Who history so we love it.

For quintessential new Who, the episodes Blink and The Girl in the Fireplace will do it for you. They're both tenth Doctor stories. As for which is most loved of new Who, it's a bitter battle between 10 and 11.

The ""destory everything"" button- is that the capsule thing? Because I'm sure that's not in the first two stories... or is it?

The Kaleds and the Thals both probably notice the population decline. In fact, in the radio drama ""I, Davros"" in the days leading up to when this story takes place, Davros presents this issue to the council and points out that the Kaled race is doomed due to declining birth rates and radioactive fallout.

Both sides are probably so war mongering and so wrapped up in it that they don't look at the bigger picture. They're both super determined to not achieve ""peace"" (a word that is socially condemned in the radio drama aforementioned), but they want to exterminate the other side utterly. Neither side trusts the other to hold true to a cease-fire, so their only option is to keep going. It *is* a war after all.

As for reviving the Dalek project, the Kaleds barely have the weaponry to maintain the war without resorting to bows and arrows. The Dalek took up a huge chunk of the Kaleds' resources, there was no second chance. By this point both sides are on the brink of destruction.

And really, since Davros *does* survive into later stories of classic Who and new Who, he *does* bring the Daleks back. A lot in fact. The thing is, when the Time Lords and the Doctor set about on this mission, neither anticipated a being like Davros who was smart and nigh impossible to kill for good (as are all awesome villains).

First of all, finish Genesis of the Daleks. It's good! Then after that, watch the first *episode* ever, An Unearthly Child (just part 1). You need to know where things started.

And a quick rundown of the Doctors..

**William Hartnell, first**- The beginnings of the series. It needs forgiveness as it's very slow, and the Doctor is kind of a jerk at first, but there are some stories I really like. The Aztecs. It's a historical. Something DW doesn't do anymore.

**Patrick Troughton, second** - Patrick Troughton is basically Matt Smith, but in the '60s. He's all silly/bumbly, but don't let that fool you, he kicks butt. His run is mostly missing thanks to the BBC but there are reconstructions. And they also suffer from '60s slowness. Watch: The Mind Robber. Tomb of the Cybermen. And if you can do reconstructions: Power of the Daleks. And the War Games last.

**Jon Pertwee, third**- A weird run as most stories are on Earth (for story reasons explained). You meet the Master. This is when things really start to modernize and feel like they were made in the 20th century. Spearhead from Space, his first story. 
Inferno starts a little slow but picks up when the Doctor ends up in an alternate universe where everyone is evil. Like that Star Trek story. The Time Warrior introduces the famous companion Sarah Jane. Curse of Peladon, The Three Doctors, Day of the Daleks and last Planet of the Spiders are also good.

**Tom Baker, fourth** The most famous run. This is when the writing enters a higher standard in Doctor Who. There are so many fantastic stories, and it's the run in which Genesis of the Daleks occurs. One of the most famous classic stories, and the one that got me into classic (above). So I say Genesis of the Daleks, Robots of Death, Face of Evil, Warrior's Gate, Deadly Assassin (for Time Lord history if anything), Horror of Fang Rock, Sunmakers, and of course lastly Logopolis.

**Peter Davison, fifth** -Earthshock, Castrovalva (2nd half picks up), Kinda, Snakedance, Mawdryn Undead, Terminus, and Enlightenment. And The Five Doctors, which is the 25th anniversary special. EDIT: wait, how could I forget Caves of Androzani?! The last 5th Doctor story.

**Colin Baker, sixth** - Just want to say, Colin got fired. Poor guy. His Doctor is a drastic change with the flamboyant technicolor dreamcoat and bombastic crazy personality. If you can get used to him, he cracks you up and makes you laugh. He's a bit abrasive but so is the first doctor. His best is easily Vengance on Varos and Attack of the Cybermen, and Revelation of the Daleks. And if you want to try Trial of a Timelord (which is an entire season) it's pretty good. The Vervoid one is the weakest story I think. The sixth is the most underappreciated and maybe disliked Doctor. People say his era is crap, so when I went into it I was worried but pleasantly surprised. Because his era is NOT crap, it's only got a couple real stinkers, like any run does.

**Sylvester McCoy, seventh**. Personally, my favorite Doctor. This is easy. Remembrance of the Daleks, The Curse of Fenric, The Greatest Show in the Galaxy, Battlefield. Good mention to The Happiness Patrol, Ghost Light, Silver Nemesis. This is the era where they really try some crazy radical stories.

true,frankster,null,null,"In the long run, it probably makes most sense if hospitals can balance lucrative private work with less rewarding NHS work. This could allow private patients to subsidise the NHS to some extent.

However the issues with this are:
1) hospitals are built to service NHS demand, not NHS demand + private demand. To some extent private demand cannibalises NHS demand, but not entirely. This means we would need more NHS hospitals built.
2) the NHS hospitals have been built at public expense for NHS patients. any private work done at NHS hospitals should be paying rent for this which should be returned to the taxpayer (government). otherwise public buildings could end up subsidising private healthcare.
3) issues about who gets priority - private patients or NHS patients.

TBH if there was any one thing in the reform proposals, then this is the measure I think they should take and abandon the rest of them. But I believe there should be a ramp up period over several years where it goes from whatever the current limit of private work is(10% ?) up to this 49% figure.

true,Axius,uk,United Kingdom,"Labour needs a new direction that throws out the old Blair/Brown schism and takes a hold of the roots of the reason for the party's existence - the working men and women of the country want representation. Not the mega-corporations or the oil traders or the banking barons; the people who work 9 til 5 in a job, getting by, who don't feel the Tories represent them.

They've strayed from this, and they're lost. I don't understand why they are, and I am beginning to think it is because they are full of people who went into politics as a job rather than with an aspiration to change things. 

People can say what they like about the unions, but their voters are working people who know what they want to hear from a party leader. Ed Miliband may not be popular but he was saying things they wanted to hear, and now he's in Parliament as the Labour leader, he's fallen on his arse and is struggling to represent anything that he tried to claim he would because he seems to be too scared to state his views.

Frankly, I'd rather if Ed was meant to be 'Red Ed' that he'd actually just BE that. There's a fear of conviction to ideals in the Labour party; something of a total lack of passion for achieving anything. It's not good.

They need idealists. They need people who are passionate about change that would benefit society. People who will do exactly what they say they will, no spin, no lies, just straight talking who can cut the PR spin of the Conservatives into ribbons because it really isn't that hard to do.

I have to say I've got more sympathy for the ideological roots of the Labour party than I have for their current attempts at being a political party. I don't want a populist party that jumps on the next big bandwagon.

true,syntax,cnty-scotland,Stravaigin,"So, this is an interesting point, and I believe that the general idea has a number of flaws, which I shall reiterate here.

1.  This minimum price - as desrcibed it appears that it applies at Retail level.  Therefore one presumes that retailers will be allowed to purchase stock at a price less than that.  This then codifies in law (for, I believe, the first time) a distinction between Retail and Wholesale purchasers.  How is this expected to interact with places like CostCo, which clearly have a mix of customer types?

2. This creates an entirely new class of offence, that of making insufficient profit.  If a retailer wishes to object to this, it's not difficult (and is, in fact, entirely accurate) that the government is mandating a price, and they are not allowed to make less profit than that.  An act illegal for shops to do on their own.

3. Such central price controls have, in the past, always caused the creation of black markets, and I see no reason to expect this occasion to be different.  Except that it's a lot easier to make profit on a black market if one doesn't pay the duty, and given that they would be breaking the law, why stop at breaking one law?

It's explicitly intended to be a regressive measure, and that's worrying.",0,1325077199,null,0,false,0,c3bt4gh,t3_ntj1y,t1_c3bt4gh,t3_ntj1y,1428086835,31,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,31

Interesting. 

&gt; up to those elected to deal with politics i.e. the politicians.

So those people aren't swayed by anything? Not lobbyists? 

The fact is, democracy is flawed because human beings are flawed, our language is flawed, our ability to perceive things is flawed, our ability to understand an increasingly automated world is flawed. The systems in which we live are now too complex for our small minds to understand.

We either accept this and continue with democracy or we work towards a technological panopticon, an automated 'intelligent' system that adapts itself to suit us - the direct descendent of things like Google, Facebook, Wolfram Alpha and so on. This is probably inevitable.

Democracy as we know it will be gone within our lifetime, so enjoy it while it lasts, even if it is wielded by those with whom you disagree. There will come a time where individuals, and governments, are fundamentally unable to deal with the ever increasing complexity of the systems that now define our world. We can see it already in the responses to the financial crisis - where automated financial systems work faster than we can find solutions, where an errant algorithm can destroy a bank, a market or even a country. Corporations, especially financial institutions, are already a form of rudimentary AI - eventually our governments will have to follow suit just to keep up.

Two things that wouldn't be effected if there were a free trade agreement, so you do well to put them aside.

&gt;the EU represents the UK's ability to remain influential and relevant on the international stage.

No.  The EU represents the EUs ability.  The EU does not represent the UK, and the UK can hardly be considered to have a consensus with the rest of the EU.  The EU is now obligated to act on behalf of the EU and not the UK, so if ever the two priorities should cross then the interest of the EU is a priority, and when the UK's economy is not indicative of the EU's, which it is often not, then that is a problem.

I'm stumped with the need for 'influence' on the world stage though.  I don't agree with what you're saying;  Britain would still be part of the G8, it would still be a permanent member of the UNSC, it would still have the world's #1 finance district, it would still have its culture, and I don't think the Commonwealth is as toothless and without prospect as you make out, the UK would have a seat at the WTO and would be at liberty to negotiate its own international trade agreements best for itself without having to doth a cap to a trade commissioner - but all *that* aside if Britain slips into an influence wilderness -so what? 

What happens *if* Britain stops influencing international matters?  It doesn't mean trade will stop.  In fact living conditions and social provision might even improve.  Maybe Britain should be reviewing and downscaling its defences, giving up the seat on the Security Council or at least encouraging more permanent members, cancelling Trident and leading by example in that regard. 

I don't think Britain would lose influence.  In fact I'd argue it would gain influence.  That being said, I think Britain has considerable more influence at the moment than both Switzerland and Norway, but if Britain losing influence meant settling for a similar standard of living then I think you'd have a really compelling argument to walk off the world stage.",0,1325084670,null,0,true,0,c3btqp9,t3_ntgxg,t1_c3btqp9,t1_c3btkyg,1428087129,7,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,7

Total transfer net spend throughout two transfer windows - probably somewhere around 40m. Which is fine, considering how the team had to be pretty much rebuilt.

Whether some of the players justify their high cost is another issue altogether. 

League position - 6th, with 4 points off the 4th place. If you take into account all the time we've hit the woodwork, the MotM performances opposition goalkeepers have had against us, the fact that we've been without Gerrard - is it really this bad? Sure, we've struggled against the park-the-bus teams. We lack plan B in attack if they're defending with 10 men in the box. That's something we'll need to improve. But if you only look at the numbers, is it really that bad? 

Last year we finished 6th with 58 points total. This year, 18 games gone, we have 31 points. Even if we only keep up this form, we'll finish on ~65 points - which could very well be enough for 4th spot in itself. However, I've no doubt we'll improve.

If you think about it this is exactly the right time for the UK to negotiate a similar trade agreement.  The rest of the EU certainly can't afford anything else rocking the boat.  Business as normal and we'll keep contributing to the single market running costs, and you can negotiate away a federalised Europe with all its crisis managing powers  without the UK stepping in the way.  The best time to renegotiate is when their house is on fire; and certain EU countries are very close to the Euro inferno.

I'm not sure where the original commenter got their information but Norway also even contributes to less developed countries through the Norway grants.  It's just much, much cheaper and it means they have far greater autonomy.

- It's special circumstances are exactly what led to the head to head in Europe before Christmas.  An entity in its own right the world's largest financial district.  I see no reason why when the UK is oligarch destination #1 that it shouldn't rock Switzerland off its perch.

- Then there is its farming and agriculture; which has grown into farms polar opposites to the small holdings we see in Europe in the likes of Germany and France, the antithesis to what the pro-small holding CAP is designed to help, whereas the fishing industry which does have a cultural inheritance UK is likewise poorly represented by the heavily industrialised CFP.  Britain is on the flip side on both.

- Then culturally Britain is the number one exporter.  Hands down.  It's ties and role in the Commonwealth certainly shouldn't be downplayed, no other EU country has remotely anywhere near that relationship, nor the relationship with the anglosphere.  Britain's cultural, media, press, commonwealth/anglosphere, the pervasiveness of British art and creativity, the language even the legal system, means that Britain is not about to become irrelevant any time soon.  Like Norway and Switzerland, Britain has far more to fall back on.

- Britain's manufacturing doesn't need a trading bloc.  When you provide precision engineering which only a few countries can provide you don't need a trading bloc, if anything it can be seen to hinder.   A specialist service doesn't need generic representation of several countries, it won't represent its interests.

Granted Norway has a small population and large oil reserves, but with all that has been argued contributing to  Britain's unique position, the discovery of what geologists consider could be the world's fourth largest oil field in the Falklands is only the cherry on the top.  

There's an elephant in the room.  With the big EU countries you can quickly argue a very real benefit specific to that country.  You can argue advantages and disadvantages but there's always one benefit, in addition to the four freedoms which come with the EEA, for why the EU can be considered to work specifically for them...with one exception.  The only reason we can have this discussion is because when you take away the four freedoms of the EEA, which countries don't need to be a member of the EU to get, the UK is left hazarding guesses on what its advantage is!  Switzerland and Norway do have unique reasons for not being part of the EU, but none more so than the UK.

No.  That's how you negotiate business, war time or in peace.  Friend or foe.  British representatives are there to get the best deal for the people they represent.  Period.

France doesn't go to the CAP AGM and announce that what they're receiving is obscenely bloated and they'd like less.  It asks for more.

When Spain was begging for their problems to be taken into consideration long before this crisis even hit, nobody went with the Scrooge on Christmas Day approach.  They were told they had to muddle through on their own, that there'd be no concessions.

When the US market bubble popped and Washington asked their friends to bring their inflation in line to help steady their market, they didn't say okay because they were good friends, which they are.  They said no.

You negotiate to get the best deal, and even the best deal still isn't a bad deal for the French, they still get UK trade, they still will get UK common market contributions if they follow the current EEA model.  There will still be UK grants.

&gt;It doesn't just not need Europe. It simply does not need anyone. My point was that the UK is not in a comparable situation.

I believe I've answered that elsewhere on this thread.  I don't know if it was to yourself or not, I suspect now it was.  If not it raised the same point.  [EDIT] Y'up, it was.",0,1325091273,null,0,false,0,c3bulck,t3_ntgxg,t1_c3bulck,t1_c3bu4jl,1428087530,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

I think your picture of the US as a blood bath is so over the top. There are dangerous places to be in the UK. Someone was stabbed in broad daylight on Oxford St on Boxing day. I'm not going to deny that violent crime in the US is absurdly high and scary, but petty crime is far, far, far lower than the UK simply because of the style of society. (UK is more on foot than the US, allowing for higher petty crime in the first place.)

I find people here friendlier. I don't like the religiousness, the guns, the lack of human rights for anyone not a white hetrosexual male....

**Never** hail a cab, get a few local numbers or ask behind the bar if you're in a pub. Try to stick to one local cab firm - they'll get to know you, prices may drop and if you lose anything in one you're more likely to get it back. Hailing a cab will tend to be double the price, and also can be risky.

Learn to love London buses, Croydon Tramlink and the Overground (Specially in SW London) - The Tube is not always the best option.

www.tfl.gov.uk is your best friend when it comes to planning journeys in London. get the London Travel Android/iPhone app too.

If you're near Tooting Broadway, The Antelope is a good pub to get an idea of what an English pub is, with a good selection of Ales too (6 taps on a weekly rotation).

What the French want is a French-German driven United States of Europe that projects French power. They are not remotely interested in free trade, which is the British tradition, their tradition is [*dirigisme*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dirigisme) or what you and I would call central planning of the economy. They have not the faintest care about what it would do to their UK trade. Trade is a thing that Brits and Dutch care about. 

Renogotiation of the treaty. This is basically heading around the capitals of the other 26 signatories and asking them to be generous. To allow the British to dodge some of their commitments under the Lisbon treaty. For nothing. For free. With no Quid Pro Quo. Why would anyone do that? They already *have* a British signature on the treaty they wanted. Why would they pass that up so the Brits can have a treaty that just has benefits but none of the costs? Countries are in trouble, yes they are, but that is *less* generous to a British begging mission, not more.

Yes, the UK should remain in the EU, but I fundamentally oppose joining the single currency and do not believe it can ever be beneficial for the majority of people. I also have strong criticisms with the way the EU is run, believing too many of the decisions are made in an undemocratic way and the whole system is lacking in transparency.

true,Rotgrub,null,null,"&gt;When Britain trades with the US, China or India, or anyone for that matter, it trades as a block with the combined clout of Germany, France, Italy, Sweden etc.

Which is exactly my point.  When you're a specialised economy in precision engineering, pharmaceuticals and luxury goods, with a world unique institute in the role as the number one finance center (much of which otherwise avoids the EU), exactly as the UK is, you don't need a trade bloc.  You're the only shop that sells what they want.  You certainly don't need someone acting as a go between representing the EU as a whole when your economy, culture and national product is unique and not represented by the bland  homogenous whole.  What you need is a specific voice which is something the EU doesn't provide.  Britain being part of the EU means it giving up its WTO seat.  If it meant there being an EU seat and  constituent member seats then that would be fine (with provision to capitalise on its special global positioning with the Commonwealth through history), but it doesn't.  The EU doesn't get its own seat; it takes all the seats of its members.

In the steel tariff dispute it was the WTO that stopped the US, yes the EU petitioned alongside several other countries, but several other countries that weren't in the EU had the choice to speak for themselves, to align with the EU or not.  The UK didn't.  And since the UK economy is so different from anything else on the continent people have to realise that in represting what is good for the EU might not always be good for the UK, and in which case the UK can be considered to be giving up their seat for something that is not going to argue in its interests.  In fact, the Commissioners are required to swear by it!  That's unacceptable.

&gt;The question is 'Is Britain a stronger country inside or outside the EU?' Is Britain capable of negotiating better terms for it's industry with India and China inside or outside Europe ?

And because of its unique role in the world, because of its unique position, history, links, trade and culture the answer is a categorical, 

              Britain is much more capable of negotiating better terms 
              for itself outside the European Union. 

There's no doubt whatsoever in it.  None.  Other EU countries, yes.  The UK, no.      
The UK is special in this regard and for the benefit of all, the UK, the world, and indeed the EU, it is better sooner than later that this is recognised.


Even you just argued that best terms should not be argued for the UK when in Europe if, as I put it, their Euro house is on fire.  Well, there's always going to be problems, crises and political wobblings going on somewhere in Europe.  So if the UK is constantly biting its lip because someone, somewhere is having trouble and not negotiating the best deal, if UK representation in the EU constantly finds itself outside the mainstream, and if the UK has a unique economy and manufacturing base then the EU could never hope in its wildest dreams to properly represent their interests.  Especially so if it then restricts its voice in the WTO and stops it from capitalising on its unique EU position in the Commonwealth, which, again, it does.

But notice I earlier said each country has a specific reason to themselves for being in the EU.  Everybody gets one perk that applies specificially to them, except the UK.  Germany as a manufacturer and powerhouse specifically gains from the ECB setting interest rates across the Eurozone.  France reaps the CAP wholesale.  Spanish fishing works the CFP,...,  but when talking about specific benefits to the UK we're talking about a trading bloc which applies to everyone and represents the UK economy least!

There is an elephant in this room, and it has nothing to do with the matter of the EU being too difficult for the average voter to understand.  It's to do with the fact that the EU isn't geared for the UK and there used to be compensation for this.  The rebate.  Only that's all but gone now.  Every informed person knows this to be self-evident truth, even those that are pro-EU:  the UK has the worst deal of all the EU states.  Somebody has to, but in this case it is the UK - and we all know that if we're being honest.",0,1325095114,null,0,true,0,c3bv7sj,t3_ntgxg,t1_c3bv7sj,t1_c3bum6x,1428087840,5,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,5

true,bowling4meth,english,Straight out of Surrey,"You are correct about the French view of what the EU should be. The purpose of the EU from France's perspective is a means of containing Germany and using German economic power to manipulate other states in France's favour. In practice France is not as effective at this as it likes to think it is, which is why the EU isn't a force on the world stage. The EU is too easily made incoherent by it's membership and lacks the leadership of a stronger political union. However, it does have a huge market in it's favour and can use trade to it's advantage.

Where it gets interesting is that the Germans have been pretty much funding everyone's bailouts with the UK and other countries chipping in now and then. Germany's position on the EU is that it likes the EU as it allows it's export oriented economy to continue to flourish as everyone in the EU gets nice german imports without tariffs or import duty. However, the German people are starting to see that the export market isn't that hot right now when you tot up the costs of bailing everyone out so they can retire up to 10 years before the Germans.

Under normal situations renegotiation of UK membership with the EU would be fought tooth and nail by the French, but we have certain options on the table to renegotiate with the nuclear option of withdrawal, leaving Germany more or less solely on the hook for funding EU bailouts. If we were to withdraw from the EU before it's stabilised it would cause a massive crisis and we would in many respects suffer for it. The question would be whether or not we would suffer more than by staying in during the collapse or putting our feet further into the fire.",0,1325095433,null,0,false,0,c3bv9sv,t3_ntgxg,t1_c3bv9sv,t1_c3bupwc,1428087871,6,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,6

true,Rotgrub,null,null,"&gt;What the French want is a French-German driven United States of Europe that projects French power. 

And I want a pony.

Just because France wants something doesn't mean it is ever going to get it, and a federalised EU which is driven by and projects French power just isn't going to happen.  It would be much more likely if it wasn't staring down the double barrels of its own economic crisis of pensions and debt coming to term.  Not likely, but at least more likely.

&gt;They have not the faintest care about what it would do to their UK trade.

They might be detached but that's not an argument, the French economy most certainly will care, French business will care, when it takes a turn for the worse.

&gt;Renogotiation of the treaty. This is basically heading around the capitals of the other 26 signatories and asking them to be generous. To allow the British to dodge some of their commitments under the Lisbon treaty. For nothing. For free. With no Quid Pro Quo. Why would anyone do that?

Erm, no.  Negotiating terms with the UK as part of the EEA and out of the EU.  Those that choose to stay can do what they want with EU treaties.

&gt;Countries are in trouble, yes they are, but that is less generous to a British begging mission, not more.

Who's begging?  Britain's far better placed out of it than in it.  The EU gains far more by Britain being part of it than not.  Britain has been proven right by not joining the EU.  They're certainly right to use their leverage now to get the best deal they can.

France can't go ripping up or denying EEA trade agreements now.  It'd draw much more criticism which would only push their pipe dream aspirations even further away.

Perfect timing for the UK to strike a perfect EEA deal, to introduce the extra regulations it wants on banks, and to revitalise and to take control  of the fishing industry back. ",0,1325098077,null,0,false,0,c3bvqrs,t3_ntgxg,t1_c3bvqrs,t1_c3bupwc,1428088101,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

It's possible it's PTSD stemming from your sexual assault or whatever it was.  That would totally do it for many people.

true,Rotgrub,null,null,"&gt;Europe has not really operated in this way, although most people will agree that 'realist' policy does still go on at many levels. 

Who cares how Europe likes to think it does business if negotiating terms for the EEA and leaving the EU.  Get the best deal.  You can't say Sarkozy was operating on compromise and quid pro quo when David Cameron went with a list, and by all accounts was willing to settle for a fig leaf, and was given a response of 'No'.  One of the requests was for the UK to be able to extend regulations on British banks extending maximum capital reserves.  Where was the Quid Pro Quo there?  It would have made no difference to Europe.  They did what they considered would have been best for their own goals.  They were going for the best deal for them.  Wouldn't expect any less, and they shouldn't expect the UK to do any less either.  UK representatives are there to get the best possible deal for the UK - if they don't have the minerals for that then they shouldn't be representatives.  No equivocation.


It's not about guilt, or friends or enemies, tough times or good times.  It's a simple matter of a UK elected representative representing the UK to get the best deal for the UK.  Nothing else, nothing more, no ill feeling.

This is the perfect time for the UK to negotiate a Norwegian style EEA membership for the UK,  complete with similar if not scaled up  UK contributions and grants.  It would also be in the EU's interests to settle terms early with the UK because the longer it goes the more the UK can tighten the screw the weaker the trading bloc appears; and UK trade is dropping with the EU.  The longer it goes on the less contributions the UK can expect to pay.  The sooner it goes through the sooner those remaining in the EU can start overhauling and remolding the EU in earnest, and addressing the real pressing problems.

&gt; It's not really beneficial to 'put the boot in' and try to get the best possible deal every time you negotiate.

It certainly is when negotiating terms for a free trade agreement!",0,1325101060,null,0,true,0,c3bwahi,t3_ntgxg,t1_c3bwahi,t1_c3bv16h,1428088338,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

NO.  That's the whole point.  It is on offer because at this time, in these circumstances Britain has all the required leverage it needs to get exactly, or near as dammit, what it wants.   It's not a case of offering it, Britain puts it on the table and nobody else can afford to take it off, not at the moment.

&gt;Then what's the point ? Why contribute the same and have less of a say on how it's spent.

Scale up Norway's contributions to make a UK equivalency, so in relative to our size and GDP, and it still becomes a tiny, tiny fraction of the current cost and in return the UK gets control of its fisheries, its agriculture, its trade agreements, its duty and quotas.

Norway's GDP is approximately a tenth of the UK's.  It's annual contributions are approximately €250 million.  Britain's EU budget deficit alone is a helluva lot more than €2.5 billion a year - and there's no real reason why it should even be scaled up that much in reality, since they're only paying for some of the running costs of the common market.  Britain may well be expected to carry a bit more of the slack than what Norway currently is, but there's only so much slack to pick up.  In reality you might only be talking of a factor of three or fourof  the Norwegian contribution.  So scaling up from a similar deal with Norway, all things fair and above board,  Britain is much better off and still gets all the positives it currently receives with the 4 freedoms.  All of them.  It also now would not only not contribute to the EU budget, but neither the CAP or CFP...and the CFP has cost Britain's fishing industry about 100,000 jobs at a time when fish prices are at a record high and when there's massive waste.

Added to that, all the little EU projects, all the NDPBs and Quangos set up by European bureaucrats which the UK government currently has to fund domestically in part - they all melt away.

- More jobs 
- Less costs
- Less bureaucracy
- Less waste 
- With *ALL* of the benefits; ECHR, freedom of movement for goods, capital, services and people
- And no more EU-UK arguments

It's a no brainer.  It's a win-win for most in Europe too because Britain will be at liberty to negotiate its own deals with the Commonwealth, which will inevitably open up a new market for Europe.  If Britain can establish these new and emerging markets, which it is uniquely positioned to do, the EU in turn will double tap as they expand.

Any EU country, if put in the same position as the UK, would do and feel the same way as what the majority of the British people feel.  Leave the EU; make a free trade agreement.  ",0,1325105584,null,0,true,0,c3bx3xa,t3_ntgxg,t1_c3bx3xa,t1_c3bwixx,1428088780,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

Its much 'fluffier' and does not even scratch the surface of the history in the way DWM does. I'd 100% say that for a whovian, DWM is a much, much better publication.

I actually think they are going about it totally the wrong way, it will make a minor impact on the total amount someone drinks each week, but my estimate would be 1-2 cans of lager a week less. ( an example)

If they really want to make an impact on drink related problems, they need to focus on the pubs and clubs. Many moons ago, it was considered bad form and bad practise to serve someone who was obviously out of their box drunk, or to allow them to buy drinks for friends who were in that state. Nowadays it seems as long as they are conscious enough to slur their order, you can serve them. No one cares as they then kick them out of the clubs, onto to the streets where they are then police/paramedic problems.  But the government ( and previous) seem intent on staying away from the whole responsible practise for pub/clubs owners, why, I have no idea. 

Their current ideas ignores that the vast majority of people who drink alcohol are not drinking it excessively on regular occasions. It also ignores the point that most of the alcohol related problems, including alcoholism is not exclusive to the poorer end of society, and the homeless.

true,Barrowmaaaaaan,silence,Silence,"I've been chewing on this for hours (because it's *very* chewy) and I might have come up with a possible solution.

it would have been horrible to show kids bravely moving on from the tragedy of a lost parent only hours after learning he was certainly dead.  That's just not how it works when you lose a parent and any real world child would probably feel a little betrayed by that ending. I know I would have.

But let's say we, and the children, knew that he was missing from the beginning. Maybe they read the telegram because they know something's wrong with mummy. The story would then have been about the sickening, frightening feeling of not knowing overlaid by having delightful, miraculous things shown them by a madman in a box. The mother is pretending to be happy for the children's sake, the children are doing the same for her. I can't imagine that playing out as anything but nauseating and grotesque.

So maybe the kids know from the beginning, or the middle, that he's definitely dead. We want to make an emotional bridge between that point and the place to begin to move on. What's the Doctor's purpose in this scenario? How would it play out? 


Maybe the children learn right after the opening credits that their father is dead. Some months before Christmas, and the scene is played with raw realism. The emotional discord between this and the pre-credits scene might be that gut-punch you want. 
A bit of the scene might show the mother, while to all outward appearances grieving, is in denial. She cannot let him go.
Then it's the Christmas season and we see the remnants of a family. The mother yells a lot because she's beginning to hate the children for being alive, and not being him. She's horrified by this, but can't seem to stop. Some adults will empathize. 
Then something miraculous happens (the TARDIS shows up in the back yard, perhaps.)  and the Doctor comes in acting all enthusiastic and puppy-like  and working wonders for the edification of the children. When he realizes they aren't edified, he deflates. He learns what's wrong and feels very sad because he realizes that his bag of tricks is useless, even irrelevant, in this  instance.  Those adults who have been unable to help a heartbroken child will be able to empathize. A second gut-punch.
Some stuff happens, the children's interest is engaged and they get glimmer of an idea that there's a whole lot to see out there. At the beginning of the show the father is in the back yard doing some astronomy. (or, as the boy called it 'agriculture.') Daddy would have loved this.
More stuff happens and mummy is shredding inside because it's increasingly difficult for her to deny. Her husband will never see this miraculous universe with all it's wonders and the knowledge is killing her.
She almost doesn't want to help the trees, but her natural kindness, curiosity and helpfulness kicks in and....
All those beautiful life-forces are released to a marvelous place thanks to her but the she and the kids need to get back home. She focuses on the one thing that will bring them back and... she sees him die. (the part where she begs 'don't make me see him die' ripped my guts out) She sees his life-force and knows that's what she's been holding on to and there's no way to bring him back but she *can* send him off through time and space to meet the trees. (*We* know he'll learn of their adventures from the forest. The family knows he's going to see such miraculous things and they are all very happy for him. The Doctor has renewed faith in his own particular vortex of chaos and recovers his sense of wonder because some humans are just so fucking cool...)

I'm keeping the part where he goes to see the Pond's but leaving out the tear because that was just lame.

So. That's the best I can come up with, and I think we can all be glad I'm not a script writer.

The TARDIS explosion caused the cracks; again, not surprising, given the Doctor fishing a chunk of it out of one.

So, the four ways companies (via their the marketing people) attempt to distinguish their vodkas are by trumpeting the base substances they ferment and then distil - in effect trumpeting the imperfections in their distilling process, by harping on about how many times they distil (you're never going to get beyond 95% pure ethanol without a different process, and you're still aiming towards 100% pure ethanol), by ridiculous notions such as filtering over diamonds etc. (filtering is valid, but the idea of using diamonds or whatever is obviously pure 'adding value') or by things they choose to add at the end of the process (which may well make for a nice smooth or different flavour but are in effect polluting the vodka to make some sort of mixed drink if they actually add any flavour, again the ideal is a neutral spirit - a dilute pure(?) ethyl alcohol base for mixing drinks).

Anyone that specifically opts out of organ donation either doesn't understand the magnitude of what organ donation would entail (stupid), or understands but doesn't care and has decided to put themselves in front of others, even in death when nothing scientifically matters (bad).

It's not a legal requirement because governments tend to respect the ideas and beliefs of their citizens, even if they're wrong. There's also a traditional aspect to it, most people want a burial ceremony or some sort, it makes them feel comfortable.

What you want no longer has any bearing after you die, especially if what you want directly prevents the well-being of others, and indirectly causes death. It shouldn't matter what you want, you might want to rape people, but we don't let you because that action causes direct harm to others. Not donating your organs causes indirect harm to others.

The problem we have here is that you think we should let people make the choices they want to make, even if they're wrong, whereas I think that's fucking ridiculous generally, even more-so in this situation given that YOUR ORGANS COULD SAVE SOMEONE'S LIFE.

On the contrary - I think it's a great quality. I've been studying hypnosis for many a year now and I've got a tone of voice I use on a susceptible work colleague that pretty nearly makes her cack herself when I say ""Wake up, wake up - you're late for work!"" (in the middle of a shift). Causes considerable headfuck if you voice act it convincingly.

Anyway.. that's great information. I haven't seen the ""filtered over diamonds"" (hilarious) marketing but I have seen the ""triple filtered"" on even the cheapest vodkas so it kinda pisses me of (a tiny bit) when Smirnoff stick obvious bollocks into their campaigns like that. I feel like they are basically saying ""You are a dick. You will fall for this shit."" every time the advert comes on.

But I think you'll find it is. We all have different ideas of what is right and wrong. You will find something acceptable whilst I will find it totally abhorrent. As you say, we should all do what we think is right. Some people will think it right that they be left in one piece after they die.

&gt;Not donating your organs causes indirect harm to others.

That is not a fair argument. There are many things I could have done differently that wouldn't have resulted in me getting attacked and my jaw broken last year... but in no way am I in any possible sense responsible for the actions of others. By not donating, I wouldn't feel in any way responsible for the fact that someone might die without my (or someone elses) heart/lungs.

They practice a religion and have no qualms donating their organs, because they want to do as much good as they can.

This isn't about differing ideas of ""right"" and ""wrong"", saving lives is empirically the right thing to do. You should feel responsible for the potentials deaths of people that could have recieved your un-donated organs after death. If you don't, then you're a bad person.

In other instances I'd agree with you, say giving to charity, because that money you don't donate to charity is tangibly worth something to you right now. By giving up that money, you're giving up a part of your worth. By not giving up your organs, you aren't retaining any worth, you're just letting people die who might otherwise have not died.

I disagree about the canon. Doctor Who has about the same canonicality as other franchises. There was great debates about Uhura's and Sulu's first names, both given in novels, before they were confirmed in the movies. If for example a novel gives Sulu's first name, and Rodenberry agreed with that name, is it canonical? Is information given in one cut of Blade Runner canonical, if it's not confirmed in other cuts? How about the name of the company in the Alien franchise? In Alien it's listed as Weylan-Yutani on props, but never named in the dialog. In Aliens it's given as Weyland-Yutani in dialog. Is the Weylan-Yutani spelling canonical, or is it a mistake in the props department which we should ignore?

It's shit, this country needs serious educational reform. They crush the creativity out of students, I loved science up until A-level. That's when I twigged that a science degree would be three more years of this shit, which I didn't want to do, so I stopped.

Also, I don't know about you, but I went to a sixth form college with over a thousand post-16 students, so each teacher had multiple classes and most of the classes were full. This means that the teacher doesn't care about individual learning as much; the ""teach by rote"" method basically gets the necessary amount of students through the exams with minimal effort.

Now you can say that this is less than what has been spent on bailing out banks, but I don't think you can claim that this is less than vast volumes of money.

I'm not saying that this is wrong btw - indeed your link suggests that we are getting bang for buck, but we should consider wider issues. Having an NHS based on bang for buck alone is a bad idea (as we may be talking about people's lives). Having an NHS that spends over a hundred billion pounds might or might not be a bad idea (for example if there's management we can cut or if there's non-essential treatments we can privatise such as [homeopathy](http://www.britishhomeopathic.org/getting_treatment/homeopathy_in_the_nhs/)).

The reform we need has to account for human factors - for example the case of whether or not women should get boob jobs on the NHS - and balance this against treatment demand, importance (in terms of life) and cost. It's not an easy thing to do and I suspect that anything we do now will become irrelevant in several decades time at most, which is why the process for such evaluations would also need to be streamlined and almost continuous, or at least able to deal with newer more effective treatments as and when they arrive.",0,1325127009,null,0,true,0,c3c0c31,t3_ns84k,t1_c3c0c31,t1_c3bv60n,1428090309,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

The Doctor's body gets crushed by barometric pressure underwater when his diving bell gets smashed by a giant Macra. The explosion from his regeneration creates a familiar looking crack in mid-air which lingers for a second, then spreads into a spiderweb pattern as the surroundings flicker and disappear like an old TV being switched off to reveal that the former surroundings were a hologram, and they're in a tank. The ""glass"" shatters outward to reveal they're in a gigantic ship which belongs to an alien race of food merchants who were supplying the Macra to a restaurant. Also, the ""water"" was actually the hypercompressed gasses that the Macra feed on which dissipates from liquid to gas form and gets vented into space. 

My twelfth Doctor: Wears a bathrobe/dressing gown all the time. Underneath the dressing gown, he wears a matching, well-tailored and pressed waistcoat and pants in dark colors and pinstripes, with various styles of dress shirt, all tastefully matching the waistcoat and pants. With the shirt, he also wears several different kinds of ties similar to ones his previous regenerations  wore(string tie, cravat, bow tie, necktie, etc.), always with whimsical patterns like smiley faces, christmas trees, polka dots, etc. His robe is always tied at the waist, although that often comes undone during action sequences. He has a familiar pocket watch (read:Time Lord pattern on the lid) on a chain in his waistcoat, which isnt his, he's ""Just holding for someone."" It doesn't do anything to him, as he often uses it to check the time. He always wears wing-tip shoes, except when the story calls for other more appropriate footwear. 

He always keeps a towel draped over the rail in the control room, as ""a good friend always told him to know where one is,"" although he doesn't know why. (A nod to Douglas Adams, Hitchhiker's guide author and former writer for Doctor Who) He's genuinely forgetful and easily distracted by ""cool things,"" unless there's danger around, in which case he easily focuses and exhibits his usual genius. Despite his forgetfulness and habit of being easily distracted, he carries himself fairly seriously. 

He's gone back to using Venusian Aikido and brags about it, although he's not often good at it, citing ""lack of practice over a few bodies. Or centuries. Both, I think."" as an excuse. He's also clumsy, citing having ""been in so many bodies"" he ""can never remember how long (his) arms and legs are."" For example, he'll often reach for something and miss it completely, either under or over-reaching.

I would use the excuse that a normal human body couldn't house a Timelord properly or something, I don't know spacey-wacey, anywho cloning is a success and River is downloaded from the Library mainframe into the new body, but shit goes wrong, and there is a big explosion, both are severely injured and have to regenerate. So I need a Doctor and a River I guess. Now freshly regenerated Doctor and River are going to be the type of people that really cause a ruckus. It has always kind of bothered me that for as much running as the Doctor does, why does he always have a big bulky coat. I think a short trench-coat styled waist-coat, still with the big collar, but slim-fitting enough that he can move and maneuver in it, probably olive-green. A tan button up shirt, with pockets, black slacks, a small-ish straw sombrero and of course running shoes. River's wardrobe would probably vary, much like Ramona II's did. The Doctor would have the strictest attention to every detail, while constantly passing himself off as an ignorant buffoon. He would say off the wall things, like say they are surrounded by an army of Judoon and about to be executed, he would go on and on about having left water boiling for tea in the Tardis, and if he didn't get back it was going to burn up his favorite kettle, and he liked it because Gandhi gave it to him and it had little pictures of elephants on it.",0,1325132174,null,0,false,0,c3c125b,t3_nue9o,t1_c3c125b,t3_nue9o,1428090642,1,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,1
