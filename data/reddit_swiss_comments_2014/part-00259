true,ruggar,null,null,"A political system must provide rules. These rules must be acceptable and legitimate. What many people forget is that these rules must satisfy other conditions:

1. They must be fair which is why they are subject to examination by courts. In Switzerland, this is particularly tricky because some rules have been voted on by the public, which gives them supreme democratic legitimacy. Imagine you find 51% of voters (not the people) who manage to push through a law that calls for the extermination of a small group of the population.

2. The rules must assure a certain continuity. If you can change or decide on any law at any given time, basic freedoms and rights like the right of ownership or the right to a fair trial might not be guaranteed. This is mob rule. Considering how much the public opinion is influenced by the mass media a news channel could easily use public outrage over an incident to gain a majority for a law that would be unacceptable in the long run. The slowness in reaction of the political system assures that these short-lived changes in public opinion are absorbed. Otherwise we have ""fast reactions"" like 1933 in Germany.

3. Delegation of leaders or public servants leads to a ""sublimation of interests"". Simply put: your immediate interest will always be to pay less taxes, increase rents for you and your friends and reduce public services for others. We can observe this kind of pursuit of very basic interests with phenomena like grass-root movements such as the Tea Party in the USA. They are reducing federal and state budgets to reduce taxes but then go on to complain about failing infrastructure.

4. Accountability: representatives can be held accountable for their decisions. The citizen voting directly over whatever he wants can't. He is free to make absolutely uninformed decisions on subjects affecting others. I wonder how many wheelchair parking lots there would be if the champions of the handicapped didn't have an entry point to the political system.

Generally, the necessity for representation and a ""slow"" political system is the result of the lack of empathy of the common voter with the rest of his fellow citizens. 
If you say that reddit is a good way to aggregate interests, have a look at it. Imagine a country run by these people. Furthermore, there are mods and rules on reddit controlling that the whole thing doesn't get out of hand. As in a political system.
