This made me chuckle. :D

As far as Zürich is concerned, I came up with a few more things:

* When you take the Polybahn, you'll end up right in front of the Federal Polytecnic University ETH which is right next to the University of Zürich. Both nice and impressive buildings. University also has a (free?) natural history museum. Quite small but very good.
* Check out Bürkliplatz, it offers a nice view of the lake and mountains.
* Uetliberg. Awesome 360 degree view of the surrounding region and the city itself.
* Consider taking a boat tour on the lake and/or the limmat river.
* Just get on a tram and go through the city, you'll see tons of things that you'll find interesting.
* While in the old town, also check out Lindenhof (location of the former Roman fortification).
* The zoo is also nice, they just openend a new elephant house, that thing is giant! There is also a really big building with a rainforest inside. Cool stuff.


Other Stuff:

* In the Interlaken region I can also recommend Blausee and Kandersteg/Öschinensee. Kandersteg offers a variety of outdoor activities, such as hiking and via ferrata. There is also a ""secret"" government bunker there where the Federal Council would be evacuated to in case of emergency. Unfortunately, you won't be able to look at it.\^^",0,1405455990,null,0,1405457010,0,ciycis3,t3_2acyo7,t1_ciycis3,t3_2acyo7,null,1434731419,2,false,Switzerland,t5_2qhp6,2

That's actually very unusual. It's most likely because it's prime holiday season right now and many people decided to go for a last minute trip because the weather was so crap until today.

&gt;I found out the hard way that many of the rectangular ""U.S. to Euro"" electrical plug adapters on Amazon will not fit in the 3-prong recessed outlets that comprised 95% of the outlets in my hotel rooms.

A [europlug](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/63/Euro-Flachstecker_2.jpg) should actually fit. What doesn't fit is a type-F  ""Schuko"" connector. That one's only common in the EU.

&gt;but don't be shy about asking for the check if you're ready to leave.

That's how it works in most restaurants. Staff will actually wait for you to tell them that you'd like to pay.

 [**Bottom quark**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bottom%20quark): [](#sfw) 

---

&gt;The __bottom quark__ or __b quark__ (from its symbol, *b*), also known as the __beauty quark__, is a third-generation [quark](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quark) with a charge of −^1⁄3 [e](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elementary_charge). Although all quarks are described in a similar way by the [quantum chromodynamics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_chromodynamics), the bottom quark's large [bare mass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quark#Mass) (around 4.2 GeV/*c*^2,  a bit more than four times the mass of a [proton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proton)), combined with low values of the [CKM matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CKM_matrix) elements *V*ub and *V*cb, gives it a distinctive signature that makes it relatively easy to identify experimentally (using a technique called [B-tagging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B-tagging)). Because three generations of quark are required for [CP violation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CP_violation) (see [CKM matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CKM_matrix)), [mesons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meson) containing the bottom quark are the easiest particles to use to investigate the phenomenon; such experiments are being performed at the [BaBar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BaBar_experiment) and [Belle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belle_Experiment) experiments. The bottom quark is also notable because it is a product in almost all [top quark](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Top_quark) decays, and is a frequent decay product for the [Higgs boson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higgs_boson).
