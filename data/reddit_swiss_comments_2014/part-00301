false,Formagella,ti,Ticino,"bachelors in switzerland are mostly in the local language, I don't know if the specific bachelor you're talking about is also offered in English but I think not since you complain that the information is in German. 

My suggestion: get a bachelor's degree in a good uni elsewhere, then a master's degree where you want, since it's the master's that matters anyway and they're offered in English in way more universities. 
UZH doesn't rank bad but St. Gallen is better, at least within Switzerland. 

If they admit you to a master but want you to follow certain bachelor courses to fill holes in your previous bachelor (this happens when you transfer universities), you risk that they are in German though. 
Try to get in contact with other italians who did this (lots of them) to see whether this happens, and with which couples of universities. 

Start learning german immediately. You need to write and read mostly, so standard german is your objective. Also for bureaucratic purposes you need that. The lessons are probably in german since there are german students too. 
To truly integrate in the society, you'll need swiss german, but that will come naturally if you live there and know standard german well.
