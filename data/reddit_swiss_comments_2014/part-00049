Why aren't we able to have negotiations right now? (Yes, Burkhalter is travelling right now, but that's more damage control...)

Contract is contract.

The problem with having negotiations is that nothing is set yet in Switzerland. We don't know how the new rules / laws will be put into effect, there are no numbers being given, etc..

So everyone is talking in a vacuum. 

Real negotiations will only be possible after those things have been addressed.

The breach of contract, however, is already in place, no matter what the numbers will be, as the Personenfreizügigkeit means no limits, none, whatsoever.

As the German professor goes... he might be overreacting, it might also just be the final straw for him.

I agree with you on the vacuum, haven't really thought about it that way. However, wouldn't it be wiser to not just cancel all the negotiations now and let some time pass? See in which direction things are going? Is it really necessary to demonstrate power like that? If the EU really, really wants to force something onto Switzerland, we don't really have a chance.

Same for the EU: their reaction is understandable, but still I find it unnecessary.

As for you: I'm truly sorry. I can only speak for myself, but I never wanted anyone to feel unwelcome here. I never wanted anyone to leave.

Madame, Monsieur,
 
L'acceptation de l'initiative populaire sur l'immigration de masse du 9 février 2014 aura des conséquences encore incertaines sur l'association de la Suisse au Programme-cadre de recherche ""Horizon 2020"", respectivement sur les modalités de participation des chercheurs suisses à H2020:
 
Communiqué du Secrétariat d'Etat à la recherche (SEFRI): http://www.unige.ch/unilist/sefri.pdf  
 
Veuillez noter les points suivants:

- Les contrats FP7 ne sont pas affectés par cette situation et le financement par la Commission européenne est assuré jusqu'à la fin des projets;

- Pour les soumissions H2020, le SEFRI recommande de participer activement et sans restriction aux appels à propositions en cours;

- Le SEFRI conseille de prendre en compte les éléments suivants pour le cas d'une éventuelle non-association de la Suisse (statut de pays tiers):
    - Composition minimale du consortium - prévoir un minimum de 3 institutions de 3 pays membres de l'UE ou associés à H2020 en plus des partenaires suisse;
    - Coordination d'un projet - selon l'état actuel des vérifications en cours, la coordination d'un projet peut être assumée par un partenaire d'un pays tiers, mais il pourrait convenir de prévoir qu'un autre partenaire issu d'un pays membre ou associé soit en mesure de reprendre la coordination si nécessaire;
    - Bourses ERC et actions Marie Sklodowska-Curie - préparer et soumettre les projets conformément aux conditions/échéances fixées par la Commission européenne et aux informations fournies par le Secteur Recherche/Euresearch.
 
Pour toute précision et tout conseil:

Par ailleurs, pour votre information, vous trouverez ci-dessous le message adressé ce jour par la vice-rectrice Margareta Baddeley à nos étudiants:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chères étudiantes, chers étudiants,

Le résultat des votations du 9 février sur l'immigration en Suisse peut susciter des questions concernant votre statut actuel et futur. Nous tenons à vous fournir les informations dont nous disposons à ce stade:

Pour les étudiants étrangers qui souhaitent faire leurs études en Suisse, la possibilité d'obtenir des visas d'étude n'est pas remise en cause par ces votations. Leur statut ne devrait donc changer ni dans l'immédiat, ni ultérieurement en raison de ce vote.

Les séjours 2013-2014 à l'étranger des étudiants suisses ""Erasmus"" ne sont pas remis en question. Pour les années 2014-2015, les participants suisses peuvent répondre sans restriction aux appels à proposition actuellement ouverts dans ""Erasmus+"", sous réserve de la conclusion d'un accord dans un délai utile. 

Le Rectorat suit bien entendu la situation de près et fait tout ce qui est dans ses pouvoirs pour que la tradition d'ouverture et d'accueil de l'Université se poursuive et afin que les étudiants et les chercheurs de l'UNIGE puissent poursuivre leurs cursus et leurs échanges en Europe dans les meilleures conditions possibles. 

Pour plus d'information, vous trouverez à l'adresse ci-après les informations délivrées le 17 février par le Secrétariat d'Etat à la formation, à la recherche et à l'innovation (SEFRI): http://www.unige.ch/unilist/sefri.pdf

En vous remerciant de l'attention que vous porterez à ce message, recevez, chères étudiantes, chers étudiants, nos salutations les meilleures.

The free movement of persons within the EU is one of the cornerstones of the EU. I'd even go as far as to say that the belief that people being able to live and work wherever they want is a GoodThing^(tm) is one of the most fundamental beliefs in the European idea.

The harsh reaction from the EU might be more understandable that way.

*As for the professor*

I agree that the ""farmer's boy from Obwalden"" comment was in bad taste, but it actually is part of the problem.
Switzerland has 23.3% foreigners, but only 3.5% unemployed. There is no crisis and that has to do with the foreigners being needed.
I invite you to look at any bigger company in Switzerland and try to exchange all the foreigners with Swiss people.

""But it has nothing to do with them! The are already here!""
Every company has fluctuations in work force. People get old and retire, foreigners might go back to where they came from, female coworkers get pregnant and leave, and some just decide to change companies.

You need to replace those, while you want to have a growing company and a growing Swiss economy.

Not gonna happen.

*As for the ""it's nothing personal""*

Sorry, but right now, I don't see a way to not take this personal. My wife and I have lived here for 8 years now. We integrate ourselves as good as possible, both our kids are born here, I work, pay taxes... the lot

Under the surface, there are troop mobilizations, naval deployments, logistical preparations, etc, all of which are incredibly difficult to hide from even the most rudimentary intelligence apparatus.  Consider a single company of men: 500 to 1000 troops.  Can you imagine 1000 people keeping a secret as large as 'We're going to war'?

This was the reason the army chose the Gripen.  As for abolishing the air force altogether:  There is a world of difference between supplementing our air defence with friendly air power on occasion and outsourcing our air force entirely.  First and foremost, should the diplomatic situation change, we could have a 24/7 air force tomorrow.  If we need to build an air force from scratch, it would take years of training, procurement etc, by which point there may not be a Switzerland to defend.  The entire swiss army is based on this idea of doing things cheap and having spotty defence but being ready to mobilize entirely on short notice.  That's why we have 400 tanks but only have 9 to 5 air cover, and why we have stockyards full of Duros and Pirhanas without tires.

Second, it is cheaper to maintain our own air force than to pay France, Italy and Germany to patrol our skies for us.  They do have 24/7 air cover, and they certainly aren't going to sell that service to us at a loss.  I think it's been twenty years since the last hijacking in swiss airspace, and any other time airspace control is important we have plenty of time to prepare: eg, Davos, the Syria talks in Montreux.  The times where 9 to 5 coverage is insufficient are few and far between, and certainly not frequent enough to justify the increased cost of outsourcing and/or 24/7 air cover.  Bear in mind, it takes nearly 15 minutes to scramble a jet, and it takes less than 20 minutes for a Boeing 747 to cross Switzerland at cruising speed.",0,1392826749,null,0,false,0,cfja9jn,t3_1y91ah,t1_cfja9jn,t1_cfj9quk,null,1432465989,1,false,Switzerland,t5_2qhp6,1

&gt; Personally I don't think we should renegotiate the free migration agreement, but I can respect that some people want to do that. The question is, how if not with a vote like this?

There was a way - well there could have been a way. In 2007, the contract became fully active with EU15, seven years later they (politicians, not the foreigners) got the people to vote against it. Voices remained unheard. This is what differs us from the surrounding countries. Swiss can step-up and kick politicians legs if they happen to ignore everything. To my believe, that's what happened. People were fed-up with the government. But the point is, the vote was worst for them. Without, the vote, they could have gone to Brussels before and come back with nothing and say ""Look we have tried, we got us not much but a bit (you always get at least a bit in negotiation)"". Now it is a strict ruling, the poor diplomat going to Brussels has less room for negotiation.

&gt; Yeah, I agree. It's too early to draw consequences for both sides, but with Croatia entering Schengen and us not going to sign the free immigration agreement with them, real consequences will arise soon.

Not sure here. No offence to Croatia, nice country beautiful, a lot to offer, but also a lot of needs. There will be a way to handle a delay. The question is, will Croatia put pressure on, or the EU in the name of Croatia.

&gt; But back to research: It's extremely important for Switzerland and we're a top player in research. Losing funding one way or another will be painful. Know-how is one of Switzerland's top exports.

&gt; It was probably the thoughest political decision I ever made-I'm only 18 though and disn't have to vote on EU-Beitritt or Schengen...

The reason why I have voted empty for Billaterale-II (plus the arguments were absolute contrary)

&gt; I was and still am worried about so many people coming to Switzerland, but it's more because of overpopulation and less because of ""loss of cultural identity"" (or whatever you call that).

This is an interesting point. How would you define our cultural identity? I agree there is one, but I also think if you are born, raised, educated here, you share the same cultural identity, but yet you're not Swiss unless you apply for citizenship.

&gt; I also think that ""shoveling"" people out of second/third world countries into first world countries is not the ideal long-term-solution.

I see I'm not the only one concerned about the media reports that Germany is recruiting nurses in China, while we hire them the personnel away. ""Good for us, good for Germany and sucks to be Chinese"":That's really not ideal.

&gt; In my opinion ""multicultural society"" shouldn't mean ""we have lots of different mini-societies"".

But that's normal to happen if you migrate to another country, you feel secure among people of your language, your background etc. It's a question of isolated those ""mini-societies"", as you call it, are. In fact, Swiss-Clubs in foreign countries are among the oldest around and in New Glarus (USA) kids learn Swiss-German in School. =)

&gt; According to the article, the EU announced this.

Think of the EU like [Medusa](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medusa). Who speaks for the EU officially? Is it Barroso, President of the EU Commision, is it Venizelos, President of EU Council, who shall it be? The man I heard the clearest was Jean Asselborn, Luxemburg Minister of Foreign Affairs and Immigration (check out the immigration numbers of his country, you will be surprised - something our politicians never told us)

&gt; Yes, politics should not be based on fear-that's why the opponents have to do a better job at explaining their arguments and bringing them all to the table. I haven't heard half of the contra arguments until after the vote!

I have to be honest, that was quite a shocker to me to read. Nothing against you, but it says a lot about our media and our beloved Sirs and Madames in Berne...
