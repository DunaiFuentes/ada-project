Sehr geehrte Damen und Herren

Nach einiger Nachforschung habe ich herausgefunden, dass ich mit meinem Smartphone LG Nexus 5, nicht kontaktlos über NFC bezahlen kann, obschon NFC Payment Software wie z.B. Paypal, sowie ein NFC Chip, vorhanden ist. Zudem habe ich in Erfahrung gebracht, dass nicht mit dem NFC Chip im Smartphone selbst der Datenaustausch statt findet, sondern über eine separat angeforderte SIM Karte.

Nach weiteren Nachforschungen konnte ich nicht nachvollziehen, wieso die Daten auf der SIM Karte 'sicherer' als auf dem Gerät selbst sein sollten - was gemäss der offiziellen Seite von Tapit der Fall ist.

Ich bitte Sie daher um ein Statement, wieso nicht der interne NFC Chips des Smartphones benutzt werden kann, in dessen Zusatzmodul die Daten ebenfalls verschlüsselt gespeichert werden (FIPS 140-2 wenn ich mich nicht irre).

Vielen Dank bereits im Voraus für Ihre Antwort.

I will not be voting as I am not a Swiss citizen.

My interest in gold was a byproduct of attempting to understand the causes of the 2008 financial crisis. I came to the conclusion that fiat currencies are tools of governments which they can use to fulfill election promises, redistribute wealth, enact policy, and centrally plan economies. Without fiat currencies governments have less power. Gold and other forms of hard money limit deficit spending and therefore make all governments, not just the US, more fiscally responsible. Gold benefits individuals while fiat currencies benefit politicians and bankers.

With this post I was trying to gauge what the gold sentiment in Switzerland is like and if these responses are any indication it seems as if the gold initiative has little chance at passing. There is a lot of hyperbolic talk about this vote on many goldbug sites who seem to think that the initiative has a good chance at passing. I doubted these claims as I believe the vast majority of citizens are not concerned about monetary policies and will be greatly influenced by politicians and central bankers.  I find it ironic that the very redditors who dismiss my arguments and are defending the wisdom of central bankers never addressed the pro-gold comments in the linked video made by former chairman of the Federal Reserve Alan Greenspan himself. I suspect that many of these redditors have the most to lose should a gold initiative pass.

false,csssss_,world,Auslandschweizer,"Hi there! I work in the payments industry (as a Security Engineer). Let me shed some more light on this.

***How do contact-less payments work?*** Contact-less payments are standardized by a body called EMVCo. In order to pay at contact-less locations, you must have an NFC card or device that implements the contact-less EMV standard. This is pretty much the same standard that is used for contact chip cards (for debit/credit cards), except it's contact-less. In the end, payments via NFC still need to be routed over a network rails that support EMV payments such as Visa or MasterCard.

***Why can't I use PayPal?*** As far as I'm aware, PayPal does not support contact-less EMV payments. It only supports sending money (via NFC) between two devices that have PayPal installed. Therefore, you can only use it with merchants that use PayPal to accept payments. What you're really looking for something like Google Wallet or Apple Pay.

***Why am I forced to use Tapit?*** Most likely because Tapit has an exclusivity contract with Swisscom. It's similar in the United States, where Verizon had an exclusivity contract with Softcard and therefore you couldn't use Google Wallet on Verizon phones for a long time. This has been an ongoing battle between Google and providers. If you think this is stupid, that's because it is.

***Sidenote: What is FIPS-140?*** It's a federal U.S. government standard specifying functionality for cryptographic hardware modules. In order for a module to be certified, it has to implement certain algorithms and fulfill certain standards. It's also not a very good standard (most of these kinda suck). But it's a requirement to have this for PCI compliance (industry body governing payment card security standards).

However the case with Google is that they do not offer drivers (on nexus phones) to contact the SIM-card to communicate with the credit card programs that are installed on the SIM. There is probably a long fight behind that the operators didn't allow google to install their stuff on the sim, and now google is preventing it from the operators as well. Also even if you think of all android phones the same, Sony, Samsung and HTC all support different standards for communicating with the SmartCard. These standards are driven by for example GSMA and Google.

Then why SIM and not XYZ? Let's face it, SIM is the only asset that Swisscom (or any telco) has in your phone, that is something they must leverage to differentiate from competitors. Also If you think of the chip on your credit card and the SIM card: these are actually very similar UICC-chips, thus it is a logical development going towards this direction. Swisscom approach also allows multiple credit cards to be installed on the SIM. These credit cards can be virtually from any bank (provided they set up their system to personalise credit cards on SIMs). These UICC chips also support a lot of asymmetric cryptography, so that only verified payment terminals are able to do payments.

What google is doing is that they have something called a ""proxy-card"" in their wallet, thus you do all the payments with google-credit card and you just feed money to this card from your other cards. This enables google to take the Issuer fee on all your purchases. As you can imagine the Swiss banks might not be super happy about someone forcing them to change their business and premium models. 

I agree that at the end of the day the customer does not really care who gets to make profits out of their purchases. We just want to get our cigarettes/train tickets/coffee and be done with it. However all the businesses should consider the fact that if you don't stagnate your own business model, someone will do it for you. And I believe that in few years there will be global mobile payment solutions that enable us to pay everywhere - with every device. These local solutions are a step on that way. Maybe some of them manage to become local standards, but as of now I only see Apple as a strong contender for a global solution.

Once you record a transaction with a terminal (NFC, chip, web form), you have to submit it to a payment gateway that will actually process it and make the monies disappear from one account and appear in another.

In Switzerland, you have Telekurs, Datatrans, Postfinance (for the Postcard). It's a lucrative business because they get a % on the transaction fee. 

Swisscom wants a part of this transaction fee. So they create a  payment platform, with a system (the app) that will allow them to receive the transaction request, and they will process it (through the credit card the user registered). 

If Paypal wants to do the same, they have to make sure either they or one of their intermediaries contact SBB or the payment provider they use and give them a way to send the transaction data and to receive monies.

As far as I am aware, the Nexus devices work with other NFC Payment apps (Paypal, CurentC etc), so storing the information in the software does not seem to be a problem, only storing the information on your sim card.

I understand Swisscom wants to push a standard they can profit from, but please do not screw over the costumer. All NFC payment stations support Apple Pay, Google Wallet and CurrentC out of the box, the only thing needed is to flip a switch in the software (active API) - current situation in the US and their push with CurrentC. So to exclude devices, only because the OS prevents access to a component that is not build to be written to in the first place, does annoy me.

false,groie,lu,Luzern,"Nexus devices use something called [Host-based Card Emulation](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/connectivity/nfc/hce.html). Basically one could say that the device connects to the Payment Issuer (google in the case of Google wallet) and fetches a list of payment tokens that can be used to authorise payments. When these tokens are running out, the application fetches more tokens.

With this approach the credit card information is stored in the cloud - not on the SIM. As we've seen with current breaches to for example iCloud it could also then be possible to steal this information from the Cloud. As all the information is stored in the same cloud, it becomes very interesting target as you could in theory get hold of lots of credit cards with one successful attack. However when this information is stored on the SIM, the most likely attack vector is to steal your phone or your SIM card and try to use that. This naturally will only expose the credit cards of a single user.

Now I must say that I am not sure how google exactly stores this information in the cloud, I expect they use different cryptographic keys for each user/card, thus adding an extra layer of security.

SIM card approach also has the advantage that it does not require your device to be turned on to function, it can power up almost entirely from the contactless field. In practice you will be able to do payments even if your phones battery is dead. This is something you will never be able to do when you need to power the main processor of your device to conduct payments.

I personally feel that the SIM based approach offers superior security and convenience of use. However the road of getting the right device, the right SIM, the credit card installed on your SIM can be a cumbersome one.
