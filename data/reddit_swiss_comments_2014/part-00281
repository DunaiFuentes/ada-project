false,rouerie,null,null,"Hello - first post, hope I'll get this right.

If your friend had an accident and was insured against accidents via his health insurance, or through the school or received unemployment benefit (""Arbeitslosenentschädigung"") at the time of the injury, then he's eligible for a daily allowance (""Unfalltaggeld""), plus the accident insurance covers his medical costs even if the surgery happens months after the fact.

If he had no accident insurance, or the injury is not due to an accident, then check if he has a sickness daily allowance insurance (""Krankentaggeldversicherung."") 

Judging by the comment below, he was not employed at the time of the injury, so I am going to assume now that he didn't have a private insurance, as it's horribly expensive. Therefore, if he was not insured against either accident or long term sickness, I think the best bet is the Social Affairs Office (""Sozialamt"") and filing for help there. 

The Unemployment Insurance does not cover job seekers who are sick for longer than 30 days (long-term illness makes you unable to seek, ergo no allowance can be paid out.) 

I saw someone mention the state disability pension fund (""Invalidenversicherung"") as a possibility.  Unfortunately, that insurance has very strict regulations, and you have to be unable to work for a minimum of 12 months before your eligibility for a disability pension or daily allowance can be evaluated. 

TL;DR: there are super many variables when it comes to insurance, but I'd just go to the local Sozialamt. Every commune has one, they're generally pretty quick, once you fight through the administrative maze traps. :) Good luck and speedy recovery, OP's friend!

(Small print: Please note, for the sake of keeping this simple, I have not detailed some of the Disability Pension Fund's programmes, minimum waiting times, or the two types of daily allowances they pay out, because in this case, neither would apply. Also edited the first sentence so it doesn't sound like a standard health insurance automatically insures against accidents, too. It does not.)",0,1411504671,null,0,1411505373,0,ckqlnlr,t3_2h8z6r,t1_ckqlnlr,t3_2h8z6r,null,1426856942,5,false,Switzerland,t5_2qhp6,5
