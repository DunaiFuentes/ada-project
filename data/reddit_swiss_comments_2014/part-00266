I would suggest that you first get a job in Venezuela make some savings and learn one of the two language. 

However if you want to do it finding a job will be absolutely necessary, living in Switzerland is very expensive especially in comparison with Venezuela. Contact all the international corporations, try to get a paid intern ship or a apprenticeship.

If you really want to study here you should contact all the schools that offer a degree which interests you and ask them what would be necessary to be accepted. All will require some form of entry exam. This will most likely take a lot of time and you will most likely have to live in Switzerland for that. 

Once you are accepted to a school you will be able to get a scholarship (my friend who was in a similar situation as yours receives about 18k a year).

But I think the most important thing is don't just ask here on reddit, but actually contact schools and institutions. Contact the Swiss consulate in Venezuela and ask for resources. Do it by phone if possible or at least by email. They should be able to help you in English.

Good Luck!

No breaks in residence or L permits. But, if you want the normal C permit, then your years as a student don't count anyways so it doesn't matter if you get an L. Then you need 5 years with a B obviously. You will be entitled to unemployment after graduating. You can even get a B permit extended during unemployment but the process is very arbitrary. It depends on your canton and your ""integration"" level. When you first become unemployed you are going to want to make the best show of being integrated you can. You're going to want language certificates, you'll need to apply mostly for jobs in Switzerland, you'll want to correspond with the unemployment office and the Migrationsamt in German. You should definitely apply for the scientist placement program through RAV. This will make you look integrated and it will fill up the hole in your CV. Best of luck with all this.

true,beRsCH,ge,Genève,"The political system hasn't evolved since 1848. The number of signature needed to start an initiative/referendum hasn't changed since back then. So while in 1848 gathering 100'000 (out of 2 million people?) was something very hard, with now 7 million people it's relatively easy, hence why we now vote on everything, but it historically wasn't always the case. Also the Swiss population was used to vote the way the government would suggest until the last 20 years maybe when we have seen individuals/opinion group/""opposition"" political party actually starting to win referendum.

Politicians aren't brave enough to adapt the threshold of signature to the growing population (which would in theory mean less stupid initiative).",0,1410386234,null,0,false,0,ckerzy4,t3_2g12kc,t1_ckerzy4,t3_2g12kc,null,1427084035,5,false,Switzerland,t5_2qhp6,5
