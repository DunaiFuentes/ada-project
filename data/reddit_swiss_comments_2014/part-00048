Take a look seriously.

Lugano looks pretty dramatic because of the steep slopes, kinda like Montecarlo. 

As far as the city goes, expect the typical lombard lake city but with swiss prices. I don't know about stuff for tourists there as I live in the north. 

Since there are trains every 30 mins during the day from there to Lugano, if you haven't seen medieval castles you might do a quick stop in Bellinzona and visit the biggest one which is Castelgrande which is right next to the train station which is in the middle of the historic centre. You can do it in half an hour if you plan well I guess, or take a full hour. It depends on what kind of ticket you're traveling on I guess. If you have a ticket to lugano for the intercity/eurocity you can't do this I think, you'd need two separate tickest maybe. Go look for some pics, it's nothing spectacular compared to the landscapes in lauterbrunnen and other popular places but it has nice walls and it's on a hill in the middle of the city so you can see over the city, there are elevators to get up there.
