Thought I’d give my take on that. I’m Swiss, from Geneva, and lived in Zurich for a while.
While I was in University, I had the chance to go study abroad myself. And went to Sevilla, south Spain.

Dude, I cannot recommend enough for you to go to Spain. Life there will be a permanent party. You'll have cheap accommodation, sex, sun, beach (and other homonym), cheap food and good vibe.

When I was working at EA, I also had the chance to live in Madrid for a while. It is awesome as well, especially in fall/winter.

If you're student and you're 22, don't give too much thinking. Go either to Spain or Italy ;)

If you endeavour to do this tour, you will enjoy an awesome view from mount Säntis – well earned though – and the ""hotel"" Bollenwees is very reasonably priced (as far as I remember, have to check on that) and from the foot of mount Säntis you can either get back to Brülisau (if you have a car) in under an hour by PostBus and train or to St. Gallen by PostBus.

(1) If you are in Lucerne anyways you might want to look into the Swiss Museum of Transportation which focuses on transportation (thanks, captain obvious) and has great exhibits in maritime, earthbound and airborne transportation over the course of Swiss history.
(2) If you like the mountains and good scenery I can only highly recommend a hike in the Alpstein, which is the Appenzellese part of the Alps. One place I can recommend in particular is an Alp called Bollenwees which lies beside a beautiful lake called Fählensee. The nature around there is great, but expect a hike of about two hours to get there. Two hours might not sound like much but factor in about 2500ft of altitude difference and you have yourself a handy package. But there is always the option to rest, as everywhere in the Alpstein, about every two hours you have an inn or a restaurant to sit down... Also if you have the time to make it in two days, you can rest at the guesthouse on Bollenwees and walk through the Saxerlücke either to Stauberen and Hoher Kasten or you could walk over Rothstein Summit down to Wildhaus and into the Toggenurg region, which is very rurual and yet very picturesque.
Those are my recommendations, I thought I had to advertise the region where I come from a little bit, and I once had an American friend here with whom I did the (2) tour and he was blown.
