true,jixani,null,null,"Yes, there is a nice hiking trail down from the Schynige Platte down to Grindelwald. It is not as spectacular as the trail from First to Schynige Platte, as it leads mostly through forests and lower meadows, and I think it adds around 90 minutes to the trail.

There are also alternatives, you can hike down to Grindelwald from Faulhorn via Bussalp, or there is also an interesting (but steep) trail down from Männdlenen to Burglauen, from where you can take the train back to Grindelwald.

One issue that you need to research is snow; I am not sure how much snow there still is on the trail, the trail is mostly marked through markings on rock, so you'll need a good map and experience if there is still snow on the ground.",0,1399751390,null,0,false,0,chemvkg,t3_257u2k,t1_chemvkg,t3_257u2k,null,1433738751,2,false,Switzerland,t5_2qhp6,2

true,whitepalms85,null,null,"In the UK UKIP is considered to be a party for uneducated racists. In Switzerland this is 27% of the population and SVP is actually even more extreme than UKIP. I just think it's funny that the public in Switzerland still lives in this delusional bubble. The fact is that Switzerland is now the most right wing and racist country in Europe. And neither the left wing nor the other right wing parties have the balls to point it out. They still accept the SVP as a legit party. I also think it's funny that the Swiss tend to talk about the 'stupid Americans' when in fact the Tea Party is pretty much the SVP (just a bit more religious and less racist instead). The whole thing is getting more and more embarrassing. I've been asked 'if Switzerland is racists country' so often in the last two years and at this point I'm not even denying it anymore.

A violation of our neutrality might harm the trust the world puts in us. And trust is important for the international organisations active in Switzerland, as well as for the banking business, the undeniable backbone of Swiss economy and also, due to Switzerland managing ca. 30% of the world's privately owned wealth, our best protection against any intervention from outside. Far more effective than any army, since anyone attacking Switzerland will instantly piss off A LOT of very wealthy and powerful people and organisations all around the world...
