The real reason why the US pays more than 45% more for healthcare than the next country in the world (funny: that would be Switzerland) is not because it's healthcare is the best. It's because it's totally out of control - no oversight, no laws, no nothing - because the private insurance companies are in control. in fact (i happen to know quite a bit about this topic), the system is so fucked up that as a doctor, you CAN'T make enough money to pay your bills (for rent, machinery, employees) if you don't get subscriptions for almost every patient - because THAT's where the money is. Unthinkable here. A hospital in the US charges 300 to 700 dollars (insane difference in price already) for an antibiotic IV which I just happen to know costs 12.50 wholesale. Price for patients/insurance in Switzerland for the SAME product? 65 francs. So you see, maybe, just from this example, that things can be deeply rotten in free market systems (they usually are). No one fixes that in the US. Obamacare is just a little band aid - very important for many poor people, but it doesn't change a damn thing. It's absolutely not what a party like the SP or even the fdp would say when analyzing the bloody mess (a sort of money eating inefficient black hole) that is the health care system of the United States.
