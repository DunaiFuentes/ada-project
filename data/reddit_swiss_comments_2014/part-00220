If you look at that compass: The FDP is your party. It stands for liberal values in economy and society. For my taste, that they focus to much on the economical aspect at the moment.
More social and green party which dislikes conservatism as well is the GLP.

Are you sure you disagree on the policy content or is it more a matter of how they do politics? In a (comparably) liberal country like Switzerland the job of a liberal party like the FDP is just preventing additional regulations 80% of the time, especially since most other parties show a remarkable willingness to regulation in pretty much everything. Opposing regulation by cooperating with big companies is highly effective.

This might give you the impression that the FDP is just a ""party of big companies"" or way to passive. Also IMHO FDP politicians don't brag half as much as others about their achievements. Assessing the FDP only through media is probably impossible since most of the time they prevent overregulation or adapt out-dated legislation instead of innovating the government, which simply doesn't catch as much public attention. Since this party is so reactive, their members (and their ideology) are very heterogeneous. I recommend evaluating individuals instead of parties. If you want a bad example, pick any of the cantonal FDP politicians in BL: None of them lives up to any expectation one could have about a libertarian.

Should you seek a more progressive party only the JFDP might satisfy you. Don't be fooled by the GLP, they've done nothing that would legitimate the 'L'.

On a side note: Switzerland is luckily still liberal enough that innovating society privately (as in ""no government involved"") is way easier than doing it by politics. This is another reason why the FDP might look so passive: Most of their members prefer to innovate society without public administration instead of discussing their ideas with the fellow half-socialist colleagues in parliament.

true,cazzovuoi,null,null,"&gt; I'm in favor of drug legalization because I think the individual should be as free as possible. Basically I only hold an individual accountable according to the NAP (non aggression principle). 

yes yes, I understand. I just wanted to highlight that the FDP doesn't follow these principles at all, and that there isn't really a party which strongly supports this view, even though the Junge FDP might come closer.

Yes it is a ""Gesellschaftsproblem"" in the sense that the society is either restrictive to the individual (the individual is forced to fit into a societal scheme) or liberal to the individual (not constricting him in his choices). Gesellschaftsliberalismus is more or less an accepted term for this, I believe. (Even though from a strict standpoint the liberal would argue that this view is wrong and that one must look at the individual being free or non-free, rather than the society being restrictive or allowing.)

May I recommend a blog to you? http://arslibertatis.com is a Swiss liberal (in your sense) who discusses liberal principles a lot (although recently he has started to venture more into arguing for arguing's sake).

As a classic liberal/libertarian I believe that society does have no right to control the individual. So it's not really a gesellschaftsproblem in my intergretation.

Thanks for the link I'll take a look at it.

Sorry but I can't take the nzz article serious when we had definitions for social liberalism and classic liberalism for a long time.

true,cazzovuoi,null,null,"&gt; The beauty about the Swiss way of voting is, that you can vote for persons only and specifically for issues. I don't vote for any single party myself.

May I highlight that this is not fully true? Specifically a personal vote is only actually a personal vote in elections without lists (such as the Ständerat) but not in the Nationalratswahlen or other (Kanton, Gemeinde) list elections. Voting for a person in the Nationalratswahlen does the following:

* it adds one vote for the list the person is on (i.e. for the party)
* and it adds one vote for the person on the internal ranking *within that list*.

The competition *among lists* decides which party gets how many seats and only then, *list-internally* the seats are distributed according to ranking. Therefore, if you vote for an eccentric party member who happens to support your views very well, but is unlikely to get elected (this is true for most people on a list except the top candidates) your vote ends up supporting the party's top candidates. I highly advise against voting for a specific person on a list (party) whose views you like if you disagree with the party's main line. It may feel cool but it ultimately works against your interest.",0,1406848582,null,0,1406849073,0,cjdh9wg,t3_2c8y4e,t1_cjdh9wg,t1_cjd3mpa,null,1435006669,1,false,Switzerland,t5_2qhp6,1
