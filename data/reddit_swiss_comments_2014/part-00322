Hong Kong has a population density of 6,544 people / square kilometer. Switzerland's population density is around 188 to 200 people / square kilometer. This translates to roughly 260 to ~280 to million inhabitants in Switzerland if we were to look at the entire area of Switzerland. Now, obviously, Switzerland's ""usable"" area is smaller. Ecopop cites 15‘700 km2, which is roughly 40% of the entire area, so now we're talking about 104 to 112 million people. Ok, let's be even more generous and use the current 'Siedlungsfläche' of roughly 3'100 km2, which translates to around 7.5% of the total area, now we're talking about a Switzerland with around 20 million people. 

So in the most generous case, a 'Hong Kongized' Switzerland should have at least 20 million inhabitants. How realistic is that? Last year, Switzerland grew by 100'000 people. If this keeps steady it will take us around 120 years to reach 20 million people. If we use a growth rate of 1.2% and compound the results, it would still take at least 75 years.

We're caught between a rock and a hard place: Tying the Frank to the € at this point is a necessary evil, but not doing so would put us in really deep shit. 

Unfortunately, there is no magic bullet by which a healthy export-based economy surrounded by bigger economies based on less-than-healthy fiscal policies (and that applies to both the € and the $) can keep its currency strong and not have its exports suffer, which in turn would lead to us importing the recession. This isn't terribly hard to grasp as a concept, so I'd be surprised if the initiative got any chance of passing.

The fact that the BNS can actually tie the Frank to the € with fairly minimal expenses through merely announcing that it intends to do so illustrates just how credible it is in the international currency market and that we are actually acting out of a position of strength. A weak economy and fiscal system would never be able to do that.

I am not questioning our lack of natural resources, nor did I mean to imply that the Nordic countries didn't have any. However, you make it sound as if the latter were the sole reason their system works. And I would just have to disagree there because in my opinion, they manage a large amount by having higher taxes. Hell, they all only have VAT way over 20% alone! Plus things like sugar taxes and not even taking into account a higher percentage of normal taxes. This leads to basically everything being heavily subsidized by the state which is a good thing for the majority of people because only the rich can be mostly independent of public funding. Note that I'm not implying that we should adopt this, it's just to prove my point. And all that without even getting close to our millionaire density.

Heh, it's funny you should mention that... But, it's not about the Nordic countries and it's not about deterring your personal responsibilities to the government. My point still stands that more tax income - in our case from rich people is good for everybody. After all, the rich do also profit from things like infrastructure and schools. The amount of taxes or the method in which they are being taxed is definitely up for debate, I give you that. I guess it's just a matter of opinion if those who have more should also give more.


&gt;Tough of course, having a high VAT isn't very socialist at all, because it hits the poor disproportionally more than it hits the rich.

This is true but it's also very selective reasoning. Since the rich do not qualify for getting help and subsidization in social matters, it cancels that effect out again. After all, VAT is only a small part of how taxation works.

It is true however that in the ""Nordic"" system the middle class generally pays more than they get but it creates a higher equality.
