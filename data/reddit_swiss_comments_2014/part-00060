true,CalibratedChaos,ag,Aargau,"I'm opposed to the initiative, full stop. 

So here is why: I run a business in Switzerland with about 100 employees. Our average salary is around 6500 CHF/mo. Within our sector, (SWISSMEM) we already have a minimum wage set at 3,850. (In eastern Aargau we are at the same level as Canton Zurich.) so first of all, the 4,000 number is already higher than we have agreed to in our collective bargaining with labor. So the number of 4,000 is already troublesome in that way. 

In the last three to four years, as the euro has fallen, the cost of labor as a percentage of revenue has increased 20% for us, purely based on the appreciation of the Swiss franc. Given that, like most manufacturers, the vast majority of my sales are into the Eurozone, this has been incredibly painful. Our payroll costs are now nearly half our revenue. And let's not forget that our access to the Eurozone is under threat, thanks to the SVP's immigration initiative. 

I have spent the last three years trying to raise my prices (ever negotiate a price hike in the automotive industry?) and get cost out any way we can. We've stopped hiring to replace people who leave. We've invested heavily in new equipment to improve our products and find new margin. And we are still struggling hard every day to keep our head above water. So why do we want to make Switzerland less competitive?

We're owned by an American private equity firm. We have a sister factory elsewhere in Europe. They can do math. We can consolidate in our other European location, slash our overhead, and add a few million to the bottom line. We haven't, yet, because we don't want to put 100 people on the street and kill the technical heritage. But, we are a lot closer to the breaking point that we want to be. 

This isn't America, where people are getting crushed into poverty at minimum wage. This is TWICE the minimum wage in Germany, which competes awfully well with Switzerland in quality and service. How do I tell a German or a French customer he needs to pay so much more than a local vendor? 

This isn't the sort of thing that causes us to lay people off at the margin. This causes us to shut our doors. Though I don't think this, alone, is fatal, if you put this in the context of the other initiatives and the overvaluation of the Swiss franc, this straw will break several camels' backs, and ours might be one.

&gt;

&gt;A **Directorial Republic** is a country ruled by a college of several people who jointly exercise the powers of a [head of state](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_of_state) or a [head of government](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_of_government). This system of government is in contrast both with [presidential republics](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidential_republic) and [parliamentary republics](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliamentary_republic).

&gt;In political history, the term **Directory**, in French Directoire, is applied to high collegial institutions of state composed of members styled director. The most important of these by far was the [Directory of 1795â1799](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Directory) in [France](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France). The system was inspired by the [Pennsylvania Constitution of 1776](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania_Constitution_of_1776), which prominently featured a collegial 12-member Supreme Executive Council with a primus inter pares President. Variants of this form of government, based on the French model, were also established in the European regions conquered by France during the [French Revolutionary Wars](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Revolutionary_Wars).

&gt;In the past, [Uruguay](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uruguay), [Yugoslavia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yugoslavia) (after [Tito](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josip_Broz_Tito)'s death), [Ukraine](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directorate_of_Ukraine), and other countries were ruled by directories. The government of the [Soviet Union](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union) could in some ways be characterized as a directory, but it developed in a much different pattern discussed in the article on [Communist states](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communist_state).

&gt;The sole country now using this form of government is [Switzerland](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switzerland), where directories rule all levels of administration, federal, cantonal and municipal. The [Swiss Federal Council](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swiss_Federal_Council) is elected by the Parliament for four years (its members cannot be dismissed), and is composed of seven members, among whom one is President and one is Vice-President, although these are relatively symbolic. There is no relationship of confidence between Parliament and the Federal Council. It is a shared system of government that reflects and represents the heterogeneity and multiethnicity of the Swiss people. Direct popular elections are used at the local level.

true,Aethec,vd,Vaud,"Laws are created when a need for them arises.

After coal companies (and others) started paying young children peanuts for exhausting and/or dangerous jobs, child labor was banned; even though they were providing money for their families, this was disastrous in the long term, and even sometimes in the short term because of accidents.

Speaking of accidents, when it became obvious that some professions were really dangerous, laws were passed to protect workers and ensure that they wouldn't be left handicapped and penniless if an accident occurred.

The number of hours a worker can do in a week was limited because without such limitations, companies were forcing workers to do a lot of hours to be employed, which had bad effects on their health both physical and mental.

Anti-monopoly laws were written because large companies started abusing their position to jack up prices; anti-cartel laws appeared once it was clear multiple companies were teaming up to make sure they had a monopoly and wouldn't actually compete with each other.

Environmental protection agencies (and related laws) were built to prevent companies from destroying the Earth in the name of profit.

Discrimination against some customers because of hate (e.g. racism, xenophobia, homophobia, ...) led to anti-discrimination laws that forbid people from refusing to serve a client based on their appearance, religion, sexual orientation, etc.

It's a game of cat and mouse: companies find ways to make money that have bad long-term effects, the government creates laws against that, the companies find other ways, ... unfortunately, there doesn't seem to be a better system.",0,1393710388,null,0,false,0,cfrywld,t3_1z6by3,t1_cfrywld,t1_cfrxmkh,null,1432616145,3,false,Switzerland,t5_2qhp6,3

true,canteloupy,vd,Vaud,"Discount supermarket chain LIDL is paying all employees at least 4000 fr a month now for full time. If they can do it, it's a big hint that most large employers can do it too.

I think that in this day and age when low income people need subsidies for their health insurance and we're complaining about employers hiring foreign people for lower wages than Swiss people, etc, we need some sort of practical solution to these problems that doesn't involve scape-goating anyone and actually implementing a better way to distribute money. 4000 isn't that much. It's 23.5 fr an hour. How much is a person's time worth? What about a woman who is leaving her baby at daycare to go to work, how much is an hour of that worth?

We all know employers would like to pay less, but let's be honest, most of those who are paying less than 4000 are pushing it. Even cleaning ladies can make 23.50 an hour if we're really honest about our capacity to pay them.",0,1393716869,null,0,false,0,cfs1bu7,t3_1z6by3,t1_cfs1bu7,t3_1z6by3,null,1432617286,2,false,Switzerland,t5_2qhp6,2
