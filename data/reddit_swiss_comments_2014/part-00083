true,whitepalms85,null,null,"The best solution from the Swiss point of view would be if the EU introduces some kind of EU wide restriction on migration for all members (e.g. that member can regulate migration above a certain threshold or so). This would mean that the Swiss government could implement the initiative simply by including these EU migration restrictions into Swiss law. 
Even though no totally unrealistic, the probability for this scenario is rather low. 

The UK seems to be the only big, influential country in the EU that pushes for restriction on migration (the Netherlands and Denmark are also under pressure from their right wing parties though but less influential) and the political process for that is long and unsure. Scotland will vote on independence this year (only indirectly related) and UK elections are in 2015. Cameron promised to let the Brits vote about remaining in the EU in 2017 earliest IF he wins and his plan is to get some commitments out of the EU concerning migration so that he can present some arguments to stay in the EU. Labour and the Liberal Democrats announced that they won't held a vote if they win. At the moment Cameron is only slightly ahead in surveys so the outcome of the election is rather unclear (but the recovering economy might help them). Even if the British vote on the EU membership it's unclear whether the EU will make commitments. However, Switzerland will probably be running out of time before this all happens and we might end up with a situation where Switzerland violates the contracts but neither the EU nor Switzerland are willing to cancel them so the EU might introduces further sanctions or so (we become the Iran of Europe ;)). The Swiss government and several political parties could prefer such a scenario and let the people vote on the bilateral contracts again with a clause that gives the contracts higher priority than migration quotas basically making the SVP initiative useless. The Swiss people are probably more willing to accept this if they see the negative consequences as I think a lot of people underestimated the negative effects (a lot of people think we could pick a fight with the EU as we're doing well anyway which is not entirely wrong but a bit naive). Currently, every week some politician or expert or whatever is coming up with a new solution but so many things are still unclear that it's all speculation.

 [**Switzerland–European Union relations**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switzerland%E2%80%93European%20Union%20relations): [](#sfw) 

---

&gt;

&gt;__Relations between Switzerland and the European Union__ (EU) are framed by a series of bilateral treaties whereby the [Swiss Confederation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switzerland) has adopted various provisions of [European Union law](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union_law) in order to participate in the [Union's single market](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_market).

&gt;In February 2014 the Swiss voted in a referendum to introduce quotas for all migrants in Switzerland. Such a quota system would, if implemented, violate the agreement between Switzerland and the European Union on the free movement of persons, and require the renegotiation of the various bilateral agreements between [Switzerland](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switzerland) and the [European Union](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union) if they are to remain in force.

This has come up again and again. Fact is that the Billaterale are the result of negotiations. We do not cherry pick! We want something, they want something. This is what we agreed on. It is often put as if the Swiss enjoyed all the benefits and the EU endures all negative effects. This is just not true.

true,whitepalms85,null,null,"Sure, the EU didn't agree to the bilateral contracts simply because they wanted to be nice. But it's more a question of how realistic it is to believe that the EU will make commitments without getting something for it. If Switzerland doesn't want to fulfill the contracts anymore than the EU can either refuse to negotiate new ones (that's their current position) or ask for commitments.

If the EU doesn't negotiate than the Swiss can either cancel the contracts or violate them. If we violate the contracts then it's clear that the EU will introduce some kind of punishment.


The EU will only negotiate if either the political situation in the EU changes (e.g. England &amp; friends force migration changes) or Switzerland pays some very high price for it. I think a lot of people don't realize that the EU isn't the same anymore as it was in the 90s when they were looking for members. A lot of the ""assets"" Switzerland can bring to the table aren't that great (e.g. the banking secret is dead anyway) and Switzerland depends much more on the EU than the EU depend on us.

Also, Switzerland is behaving very aggressively. Imagine just for a moment Switzerland would have done something nice for the EU in the crisis instead of trying to squeeze more out of them (e.g. some help for Southern Europe or so).  Then Switzerland would be considered a friend and EU politicians can rather allow exceptions for friends than for purely their own benefits maximizing business people. But the Swiss are so hostile towards the EU that such a thing is unthinkable. 
Switzerland is basically saying fuck you to the EU in the middle of a crisis because of some rich people problems while other countries are at the brink of collapse. I think a lot of EU politicians see Switzerland as a spoiled rich kid with too much confidence but few real power. We are really not that important to the EU and we don't give them any reasons to be nice to us.


Also I don't think it's not very smart to pay a very high price just for some restrictions on migrations. We will probably end up paying more than all the negative effects of migration cause.
