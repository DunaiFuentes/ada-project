I also disagree vehemently about you stating that Belgium is in a similar position as Switzerland. Belgium have a lot of young stars in the top leagues of Europe, not just playing in, but stars in. Switzerland have elevated themselves into a top soccer country in the world, but I can't fault someone for thinking they will struggle in their group. Obviously, they could lose to Honduras - but I think that is amazingly unlikely. France have looked unbeatable, so I don't disagree with the author's premise that Nati will be fighting it out for second.

true,throwaway_engine,null,null,"And I sincerely believe you! I'm sure there are good people working there. I've also talked to some people from the former Swisscom Innovations (in Bern), and they did work on some cool stuff. 

To be honest, I think these same HR problems exist in other large companies as well, especially if they are not exclusively IT companies (e.g. banks, etc.). They have to hire lots of different people, so they don't really specialize the interviews for each field and interviews end up being very general.

I *did* think the mixup was funny, but I was just too stressed out to be thinking of laughing. After all, these HR type questions can be quite difficult to answer well compared to technical questions.

In the end, the main reason I declined was that I didn't get the feeling the technical guy was very motivated, wheras I could feel genuine excitement at other companies. Of course the guy could have just had a bad day, I will never know. The OPs experience may also vary, depending on who he meets at the interview.

true,raskalnikow,zh,Zürich,"Before Napoleon Bonaparte, VD wasn't a free state on its own. Back then VD has been occupied by BE (Berne-City ruled basically over BE, JU and VD). Somewhere around the French Revolution (/uprisings) VD declared independence - in the spirit of the French Revolution. The Bernese rulers quickly retracted, b/c they feared a French intervention in favour for their now-brother-state VD (République Lémanique). After the French invasion of Switzerland, Napoleon created the République Helvetique (Mediation) and the formar independant R. Lémanique was given a new name (Canton Léman) and incorporated as equal Canton.
Later the French Empire collapsed and the Swiss reorganized their territory, but kept many ""big"" decisions of Napoleon - like the new Canton Léman (now called Vaud).

The words on the flag: ""Liberté et Patrie"" (Freedom and Motherland [literally ""Fatherland""]) reflect the struggle for independence and clearly are inspired by the french ""liberté, égalité, fraternité"".

The green colours (and the Tricolore) in Swiss flags often indicate Cantons/ entities newly founded in the course of the french regime (and its aftermath).

tl;dr: VD it is about the French Revolution (and their own vaudoise revolution).

true,buyacasha,zh,Zürich,"My process was very straight forward. The first interview mainly consisted of your usual soft skill HR questions plus some light introduction to the technical side by my future manager. The second interview was an hour long talk about the tech aspects of the job where I was asked tons of questions. All in all, it was a very pleasant interview process. I personally despise whiteboard interviews because I really don't see what these would tell the interviewer apart from the question whether or not the applicant gets nervous in that weird made up situation.
