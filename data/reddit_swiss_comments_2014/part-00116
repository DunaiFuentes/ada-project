true,unicornsworshipme,zh,Zürich,"Even if you manage to get a rental car on a Sunday you won't save much time. Sure, the trip by train is 1h to 1.5h longer, but you can just hop in a train in Lauterbrunnen and don't have to go to the car rental place first and have all those rental hassles. Oh, and the probability for traffic jams on a nice sunday is pretty high. So if you don't have too much luggage, take the train.

SBB.ch says the trip from Lauterbrunnen to Vaduz is 4.25h. My advice: Invest another hour! (In the timetable form enter ""Meiringen"" in the ""via"" field.) The Interlaken-Bern-Zurich route is faster, but if you travel via Meiringen and Lucerne you will enjoy a very beautiful trip. Do that, it is worth it!

You also wrote that you are interested in the Klausenstrasse which indeed is very nice. But be aware of two things: This is a detour, if you want to travel as fast as possible, i wouldn't recommend it. Also don't do it if you are afraid of heights.
