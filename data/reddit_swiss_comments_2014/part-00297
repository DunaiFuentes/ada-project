- Vaud: Riviera is full of rich people, progressive. Montreux Jazz Festival &amp; Paleo Festival. Gros-de-Vaud (north) is full of conservative farmers. They are proud to have chased away Bern's occupation of their land.

- Valais: Half french, half german. Catholic conservative. Hunters. Inbreeding. Good wine. Most Valaisans work in Geneva to make a living and go back to their villages during weekends to pay less taxes.

- Fribourg: 60% french-speaking, 40% german-speaking. Catholic conservative. Almost no night-life. Good cheese. Pigs.

People walk by some beggars in Geneva. One man stops and give him a few coins.

Another man stops and shout at the man who gave the coin. Because the more people give money, the more poor people come begging in the streets of Geneva.
