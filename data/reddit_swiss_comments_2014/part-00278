There's this mentality by a lot of companies that make you feel that you're more of an nuisance than a welcomed customer. Quick example: I was shopping for a new kitchen (everything) and asked a few companies for a detailed quote until a certain date. Very few even bothered to respond, one came back a week later and could not believe I didn't wait for him. The concept of having the customer dictating the terms was foreign to him.

It's been 3 years now. Granted he's not doing a marriage visa because he started the process before he met me and it might be different in Switzerland,  but I'd be prepared for a lot of waiting.
 
Now about Switzerland.  He is from the German part, and I love it there. I'm surprised there haven't been more comments about Swiss German. You can't learn Swiss German unless you go full immersion basically. My German teacher (from Germany) had lived in Lucerne for 5 years and she could understand Swiss German only in the Lucerne area and she still couldn't speak it. I could write a book about how frustrating it is to try and learn a language that has no standardized spelling and every town (and sometimes individual person) has their own dialect.  

But, if you learn Standard German you can speak to everyone in the German part and it is a beautiful language.  I recommend learning Standard German first and then trying to learn the dialect of wherever you end up once you're there. 

""Swiss French"" is the same as standard French as far as I can tell except for a couple numbers and words. Basically the difference between Canadian and American English. I've also heard that the Swiss speak french a little slower and softer than the French, so it's a giod place to learn the language.

Is the climate significantly warmer? Like, is there snow in the winter? Is there especially hot summers? And how does that compare to your region?

Thank you SO much for taking the time to answer these. I can't say enough how valuable this information is for me. 

How would you say the difference in political opinion manifests in daily life? Like, for instance, I'm not LGBT, but I'm LGBT-friendly. Does the conservative side have less openness in that regard, for example? I'm just trying to better understand what the implications to that are.

If its truly the same all around, I would choose to learn Swiss German and Italian/Spanish. I like the economic benefit of knowing German and I like the life benefit and travel benefit of Italian/Spanish. My mom spoke French, but I have less interest in the language (although its all, admittedly, pretty arbitrary).
