true,P1r4nha,zh,Zürich,"You are right and on a large scale my idea of distinguishing different kind of foreigners doesn't make much sense. With over a million foreigners in Switzerland, even the 80'000 more in the last year are almost negligible.

Let's look at Zurich though and where people are going to live when they want to live and work here. Since Zurich doesn't construct high buildings, it's easier to find housing in the suburbs around Zurich and Winterthur. That means that fresh immigrants are more likely to be in suburbs and only after being better integrated, might actually be able to move closer into the city (one reason is that many places are advertized to friends and coworkers first).

If we look where in Zurich people voted yes, and where they voted no, we see that only the city voted no, while the suburbs voted yes.

So when we look at immigration patterns of foreigners, rather than the absolute number of foreigners we might actually find a positive correlation, rather than a negative one, as was shown in the graph posted by OP.

I can't exactly prove that unfortunately, because I don't have the data, but I've seen a graph where they did something like that for Zurich and it actually did show a positive correlation of yes votes and freshly immigrated foreigners.

&gt; Yes it is a fundamental principle in switzerland, but that doesn't mean we shouldn't critize it, question it and change it for the better.

You sure are right with that one. It is an important part of a healthy nation to discuss and redefine fundamental principles. But I would exclude the definition of democratic decision and the people voted 'nay' so we have to accept it. (if you follow the comment section in our news papers, it's funny to see how many have no idea what democracy is...)

&gt; &gt; We have solidarity not just in health care, but pension, public transportation, tax system, education system (why the hell should you pay for schools if you have no kids? Because it's a solidarity act and helps to keep our schools somewhat cheap and education at a fair level). I could go on whit that, but I'm sure you find some good examples yourself. The imporant is find something that others pay in solidarity for you (or will do in the future) and appreciate the solidarity we built among our values, among our consitution.

&gt; Yes, these are good examples and I profit from some of these things too. For example our education system. I just got accepted to a university and only need to pay 1200.- every year. That's nice and it's really convinient. The question is, would it be cheaper for me (as an individual) if I paid for it myself but wouldn't have to pay taxes (for art projects I don't enjoy, Healthcare I don't need, etc.)?

Good for you! You get to experience ""solidarity by law"" yourself. You want to know if it wouldn't be cheaper if you paid it fully? I guess you have no idea how much a student costs per year, let me help you with that....an MSc. student in engineering costs yearly 20k - 30k. With your 1200.- you don't even pay 1%! It looks like you have never spoke to a student at a US Uni... 

And that amount is just for the place of study, if you would accumulate all the benefits you get as a student, that will sum up. Let's just name a few: ""half-fare rate in public transportation"", ""lower health insurance costs"", ""lower rates for museum, concerts, art and so on"", ""cheap meals at Uni"", ""possible accommodation help (financially)"". I don't want and can't put a price tag on everything, but lets just say it's a lot you get as a student.

Your thought now is, that as you would - over all - pay less if all that stuff was not included in tax or the regular prices (that's part of the calculation of shops giving you student reduction). You are missing one very important point. Not everyone in Switzerland is of great wealth and could just easily drop 20k+ at a University for a year of study. Plus having additional 25k living cost over the year. This is what your idea is about. You need the money in advance and if you fail or if you realise this is not your field of study, you may have not enough money to start over again with another studies. And you endup without education that made you valuable for labor market. This is why I said as a libertarian, I support solidarity in some sort. Your example is at best, because it directly affect the value of the only natural resource of Switzerland, the human capital.

&gt; Sorry if my post says otherwise, my fingers seem to be too fast sometimes.
Better leave that behind if you want to excel ;-) Profs will challenge you if you use strict language as in your first post and you can't win that argument because your position is fixed. Anyway, it was great to have a discussion with someone who is capable of building an argument. I really wish you all the best with your studies and don't forget, we have to pay prices for the one who can't afford it all - and they are not always in a poor country, but under us.

No problem, thanks for responding.

&gt; You sure are right with that one. It is an important part of a healthy nation to discuss and redefine fundamental principles. But I would exclude the definition of democratic decision and the people voted 'nay' so we have to accept it. (if you follow the comment section in our news papers, it's funny to see how many have no idea what democracy is...)

Yes, I fully accept the decision and the vote. I didn't mean we have to discuss this example at the moment, I meant we have to be able to discuss fundamental principals our society is based on like solidarity without being labeled as egoistic. Friedrich Nietzsche - The Dawn - Aphorism 297

&gt; Good for you! You get to experience ""solidarity by law"" yourself. You want to know if it wouldn't be cheaper if you paid it fully? I guess you have no idea how much a student costs per year, let me help you with that....an MSc. student in engineering costs yearly 20k - 30k. With your 1200.- you don't even pay 1%! It looks like you have never spoke to a student at a US Uni...

I already have a bachelor degree in Computer Science, so I'm well aware of the cost involved. I would say that for a bachelor degree the cost would be up to 500'000 (if you had to pay and there was no government to cover a big part of the cost. In the US you have to pay up to 100k a year if your studying at an elite university).

Yes, we have to pay for people who are of worse, but I would prefer if I wasn't required to do so but would be able to choose who to support and where my money would go towards. I would probably end up paying a similar amount but I would have the closure of knowing what I support. Thanks for replying, I fairly enjoyed the discussion. You seem to be open-minded.

Don't think because of the rally from EU, the media, the opponents etc. is reason enough for yes voters to keep their mouth shut? Go on twitter and read the stuff with #abst14. In general I think it is okay to feel mad it one voted against the MEI initiative. But the lack of respect given to the opponents (and currently more in focus by the one who lost on Sunday) is shocking. We have been proud on our nation to have a direct democratic system and now we call each other retard, dumb, racists and much more.

At the end I think, we all have lost on Sunday and I feel a shamed of us as a nation - not because we have accepted MEI, I can respect that, I have to respect that - because we act like little dictators.

I have friends voted on both sides and I would like to give you some of the topics we have talked bout.

Yes voters were:

* mad about the lied number in the first vote (I think it was 2002). That number said 10000, you could expect more but in fact it's now 160k netto and 80k brutto
* mad about the lie that the economy needs all the people coming. Remeber only a small part is working, the rest is family
* mad about the fact, that our government does not bring the contract to actual use. Many arguments that fall under this point came from [that article](http://www.tagesanzeiger.ch/news/standard/Diese-Fakten-bringt-die-Zuwanderungsinitiative-ans-Licht/story/26741991) [side note, some even got me mad. like the social aid that was unlawfully given, or the extended residency permit which should not have been given)
* a lot was about the feeling of betrayal and to some points I was just speachless. What do you want to answer a mad civilian that feels lied to, betrayed and can show you exact that points, that this was not just made up. In fact this is probably a reason why the MEI was successful, because the opponents did not take care on that points

No voters...:

* were generally concerned about the consequences
* had warned that the EU is not able to understand the problem of the Swiss
* shoed that Luxemburg had an even higher migration (the only EU country in front of us)
* (many) thought as well that politicians should go to Brussels and talk about the contract (i will come back on that a bit later)
* said that the economy needs those employees, and even if just parts of the 80k brutto migrants are laborforce
* said that politics should take real action to deal with the migration and its negative consequences (living costs, transportation cost etc.) but not in form of cancelling the contract
* were often arguing with common sense (a failure done by so many)

That's pretty much most that I can recall, we had some good whiskey later ;-) I hope you might find a well-educated yes-voter to bring up his mind here. But I don't think that's going to happen...

Something that made me angry on Sunday was, when I actually read the [Personenfreizügigkeits Abkommen](http://www.admin.ch/opc/de/classified-compilation/19994648/index.html) we have since 2002. I was too young to vote at that time. This is what article 18 says (keep in mind the voices of EU/CH politicians over the past six years and especially the past 7 days):

&gt; Art. 18 Revision
&gt; Wünscht eine Vertragspartei eine Revision dieses Abkommens, so unterbreitet sie dem Gemischten Ausschuss hierzu einen Vorschlag. Die Änderung dieses Abkommens tritt nach Abschluss der jeweiligen internen Verfahren in Kraft; hiervon ausgenommen sind Änderungen der Anhänge II und III, die vom Gemischten Ausschuss beschlossen werden und sofort nach dessen Beschluss in Kraft treten können.

How many times have be been told, there is absolute no option to talk about the contract... Seems like our politicians have no idea about what they speak. I actually don't expect all the EU politicians to know that contract. But I have to admit, after I read that article, my first thought was ""We could have avoided what just had happened..."".

Overall I found the reactions on both sides too crazy. Blocher mentioned in the TA interview he'd expected the contracts all being canceled by now. The left is whining about things I don't think will happen by a long shot.

There are many EU opponents (not just in Switzerland) who view the EU as an anti-democratic bully. Invoking the guillotine clause would only reinforce that sentiment and give fuel to those in other countries that are seeking to leave the EU. On the other hand they also can't be too lenient as it will make them appear week. This would also strengthen the separatist movement. The EU is in a really difficult spot, and I do think we will have the upper hand in the negotiations as long as we play it smart.
