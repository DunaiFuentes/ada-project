---

&gt;

&gt;The original Bircher-Benner recipe is proportionately the opposite of most muesli available in today's supermarket varieties, calling for far more fruit than grains. One serving based on the original recipe consists approximately of:

&gt;


&gt;* 1 [tablespoon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tablespoon) [rolled oats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rolled_oats), soaked in 2–3 tablespoons water

&gt;* 1 tablespoon [lemon juice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lemon_juice)

&gt;* 1 tablespoon [cream](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cream)

&gt;* 200 [grams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gram) [apple](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple) (about one large, preferably a sour variety), finely grated and mixed with the above directly before serving

&gt;* optionally topped with 1 tablespoon ground [hazelnuts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hazelnut) or [almonds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Almond)

&gt;The original recipe used sweetened [condensed milk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Condensed_milk) instead of cream, a compromise due to hygiene concerns regarding [fresh milk products](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raw_milk) in 1900 (bovine [tuberculosis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuberculosis) etc.), before [pasteurisation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pasteurisation) and [refrigeration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refrigeration) became commonly available. The original recipe also advised to soak the oats in water overnight as raw oats need a lengthy soaking to soften them before eating. This long soaking time is unnecessary with modern rolled ""quick oats"", which the manufacturers already soften through a steam treatment. While [phytic acid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phytic_acid) is an [antinutrient](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antinutrient) and strong [chelator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chelator) of important minerals, it is removed during the oat groat's dehusking step (and mixture with lemon juice).

Some places i liked were:
The top of GrimselPass (between Berne and Valais)
At the hammetschwand lift area. Near Lucerne
At Sanetsch, Bise de Savièse and Grand Dixence (Valais)
Moléson (near Gruyères)
Creux du Van (near Neuchatel)
All these are easy/medium trails, nice to enjoy the scenery.

People seem to like Lauterbrunnen area a lot.

I hope other guys near the german region can give you closer tips.

In any case, this website is quite good
