[Link NZZ] (http://www.nzz.ch/meinung/debatte/goldinitiative-und-vollgeld-initiative-1.18283455)

After doing some reasearch in the interwebs, honestly i dont know what this is all about really, it seems highly complicated to me.
I think putting this infront of the public is the wrong decision, most people of our society dont even understand the risk or effects or the mechanics of these things. Damn, thats why we have the SNB in the first place, to regulate the system and deal with stability issues. Why does the sovereign have to vote on this? I certainly would feel uncomfortable voting, and it will most likely be ending up in some propaganda biased initiative again, where people just vote what they have been told by some bünzli politician.

On another personal note, the SNB and Swiss Franc is chained to the Euro and the Dollar, and in turn to the FED and EZB. 
GUYS, DID WE ALREADY FORGET ABOUT 1.20CHF DISASTER A FEW YEARS AGO?
Where the SNB activity needs to buy a massive amount of other currencies to keep the CHF down? If it goes higher then 1.20 CHF / 1 Euro, the whole export industry will complain again that no other country will buy again. And we already know that import winning never go inline, companies just keep the gain for themselfs.

So, sorry, i wont sign it, nor will i vote yes for it, because:

Many people have no clue about economics. There is a reason it's a subject at universities and people take years to learn it. 

&gt; We allow a certain type of company (banks) to create money out of ""thin air"" (2.5% minimum reserve requirement)

This is false. 

Only the SNB can create money. They are selling that money (usually through [Swaps](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swap_%28finance%29)) on the market for banks to pick up. This is also how they can regulate the market (sell less money, increase the price, buy it back/wait for the bonds to expire).

If you think about it, a minimum reserve makes no sense if the banks could create their own money because they'd just use the money they just created as a part of their reserve. Even if that reserve had to be physical in your example, the banks would just hoard every bit of cash they can get because it would allow them to create even more money. 

You are correct on the 2.5% although [Basel III](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basel_III) worked to increase that margin. 

&gt;  I want this vote to happen so that more people will actually take some time to inform themselves and form an opinion.

If you want to work as a cashier at a local store as Migros or Coop to scan the items the customers want to buy, you probably are best advised to just step in and ask, if they have any vacancies.

As I am also looking for a job (financial area), I can recommend you to use the following sites if you want also a job in this particular area (which is currently quite hard):

http://www.jobdirectory.ch/de - offers great overview, what jobs are open at bigger banks, such as UBS, CS, Cantonal Banc of Zurich, and many more.

http://www.stellen.ch/ has a great variety of job offers, you just have to select on the left the area and define the wanted region.

http://www.stellen-zuerich.ch/ as one of the biggest cities is Zurich, you might end up also using this site, which only shows jobs in and around the city.

http://www.jobs4finance.ch/de/ I have also saved, but never greatly used it.

There are also a few agencies, which will gladly try to find you a job (as they get a provision for every person they find a job). such as:

http://www.schoepferjobs.ch/

http://www.pagepersonnel.ch/?language=en

best is to have your CV ready and apply by email or website of the firm.
