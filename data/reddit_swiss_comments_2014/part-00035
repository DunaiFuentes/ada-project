Many flats stay within companies because nobody wants the hassle of putting it up on homegate or equivalent.  The moment you advertise a place, you'll have a hundred people calling you, so they get advertised internally.  That's how I found mine.

 [**Rumspringa**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rumspringa): 

---

&gt;**Rumspringa** (IPA: [rəmˈsprɪŋə], Pennsylvania Dutch: [rʊmˈʃprɪŋə]), also spelled **Rumschpringe** or **Rumshpringa**, is a term for [adolescence](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolescent) used in some [Amish](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amish) communities. The Amish, a subsect of the [Anabaptist](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anabaptist) Christian movement, intentionally segregate themselves from other communities as a part of their faith. The Rumspringa normally begins around the age of 14 to 16 and ends when a youth chooses [baptism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baptism) within the Amish church, or instead leaves the community.:10–11 The vast majority choose baptism and remain in the church. Not all Amish use this term (it does not occur in John Hostetler's extended discussion of adolescence among the Amish), but in sects that do, Amish elders generally view it as a time for courtship and finding a spouse.:14 A popular view exists by which the period is institutionalized as a [rite of passage](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rite_of_passage), and the usual behavioral restrictions are relaxed, so that Amish youth can acquire some experience and knowledge of the non-Amish world.
