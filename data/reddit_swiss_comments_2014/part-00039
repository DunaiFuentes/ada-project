Swiss Italian is, as far as I'm aware, very similar to northern italian italian. Swiss French is basically standard french with a few minor differences. Swiss German however is a bit more complex:

Native Swiss speak a very heavy dialect, known as Swiss German or Alemanic. This is basically ununderstandable to Germans. However, every single one of them, except very little children, can also speak the standard language, although often with a heavy accent. This is because we're forced to speak it in school.

This map is about the regional unofficial languages: 
http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6b/Alemannic-Dialects-Map-English.png

Swiss german/Allemannic is basically the most used language and mother language of most of the people in the swiss german area. Everybody uses it. 

In Ticino, which is most of the italian area, only 50% of people are sons of 2 natives, so I guess that's about the proportion of people who speak the local dialects of Lombard. It's often used in informal settings, not just in the family. It's way more vital than in Lombardy.

Look at who votes for this. Their jobs are not threatened by the foreigners, they live in secure conservative areas where everyone is white. They just get worked up thinking somewhere some immigrant who had the gall not to be born in this country is having a little too good a time using some taxpayer money. They want their Swiss white and rich and that foreigners should always remember who their superiors are and that they could be kicked out any minute, even the kids.

They want to pay their cleaning lady a shit wage but when employers start to pay even the Swiss lower salaries they scream that it is the foreigner who is responsible for accepting such conditions. But heaven forbid we had minimum wage or unions because they have been convinced by our good ol boys in the right wing that those are anathema.

They dream of an independent Switzerland who could trade with Europe on its own terms, as if that were even possible.

They defend the right of the majority to oppress minorities by consensus. Women are allowed to work of course but do we really want to encourage such selfish behavior using tax money for daycare? But of course in case of divorce these ladies should just get a job...

I am familiar with the US quota system having gone through it myself, and I would imagine that the Swiss system would work somewhat similarly. In the US the quota sets the upper limit of how many working permits of a given class can be approved in a year. Your employer petitions the government for a visa on your behalf, and has to show that you are qualified for said job (this addresses your concern about the government not being able to asses who is competent and who is not). After that it is first-come first-served until the quota is reached. This means that in reality there is no preferential treatment given to startups since both startups and large corporations should have equal chances as long as the petitions are filed early enough. As you said, this would still all be contingent on the government setting the quotas high enough. I am not too worried about this aspect since it's in everyone's best interest to set the quotas sufficiently high for professions where there is a shortage. I might be overly optimistic in all of this, but my basic point is that this new system can be set up in a way that works. As you said, it will be impossible to say what would have been.

The areas I'm talking about include development, systems architecture (not sysadmin stuff - since that's subject to a natural process of automation), and other higher-value positions, particularly for experienced workers.  So not recent graduates - your friends wouldn't be affected.  Yet.  

Particularly in high-cost areas like Zurich or Geneva, this sometimes heavily impacts older employees.  Nobody's having trouble putting food on the table, and I know that in this time of caring so much about other people earning ""too much"" it's not very popular to argue for high salaries for experienced specialists.  But we shouldn't be encouraging mediocre pay for good work.

Part of the issue is that large firms have increasingly tended to choose ""strategic"" outsourcers - basically, body shops that are able to take an increasing cut of rates charged to customers by insisting on hiring its own people as lower-salaried, permanent staff.  Rates for skilled consultants have also dropped precipitously due to this - I've seen places advertise for contractors with huge batteries of skills at sub-500CHF/day, for jobs that should be paying 2-3 times that much (if that seems like a lot, I can gladly give you a rundown of the economics of it.)  

Some of it is long-term fallout from the often obscene rates charged in the early 2000s, but that doesn't even come close to explaining it.  I've had trouble finding skilled staff, and it's causing long-term damages because firms are profiting from an existing pool of skilled employees without investing in future development.

&gt;**Direct democracy** (also known as **pure democracy**) is a form of [democracy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy) in which people decide (e.g. vote on, form consensus on, etc.) policy initiatives directly, as opposed to a [representative democracy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representative_democracy) in which people vote for representatives who then decide policy initiatives. Depending on the particular system in use, it might entail passing executive decisions, the use of [sortition](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sortition), making [laws](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law), directly electing or dismissing officials and conducting [trials](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial). Two leading forms of direct democracy are [participatory democracy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Participatory_democracy) and [deliberative democracy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deliberative_democracy).

 [**Democratic deficit in the European Union**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic%20deficit%20in%20the%20European%20Union): 

---

&gt;The concept of a **[Democratic deficit](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_deficit)** within the **[European Union](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union)** is the idea that the governance of the European Union in some way lacks democratic legitimacy. The term was initially used to criticise the transfer of [legislative](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legislative) powers from national governments to the Council of ministers of the EU. This led to an elected [European Parliament](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Parliament) being created and given the power to approve or reject EU legislation. Since then, usage of the term has broadened to describe newer issues facing the European Union.

It depends.  You can't really translate it into the same as ""salary"" because it doesn't factor in holidays and sick leave (unpaid), insecurity (contract jobs tend to be one month's notice period, and time-limited) and education.  Often you're also responsible for paying your share of the employee salary deductions (a good rule of thumb is about 20-25%, rather than around 10-15% of the total) and if you're already going through a middleman, you generally don't benefit from tax breaks given to Einzelfirma or GmbH (i.e. your business expenses like training, laptop, etc.) and you don't get any of the goodies that companies give their employees, 4 weeks paid vacation, and others.

So for some grossly oversimplified, awful math, that's about 2k/week = 8k/month = 96k/year = 88k/year after holidays = 84k/year after misc. expenses (sickness, training, etc.).  Reckon another 2-4 weeks lost for military.  Then add in 1-3 months downtime / job search.

This varies enormously from person to person, but the final result is that someone with 10+ years of serious experience in a field that's strongly in demand should not _have_ to make these kinds of calculations.

I was getting around 1200/day for longer projects back in 2002, and that was after the dot-com crash.  I can also only judge salaries from what I was offered then and what I see big firms paying now for cutting-edge skills and experienced professionals.

For the Commission it is a problem many have raised but I would be more in favor of them adopting some kind of parliamentary control over all Europe-wide decisions as has been suggested (http://www.presseurop.eu/fr/content/article/3892891-comment-resorber-le-deficit-democratique).

I am as you could guess very much in favor of something like the US of Europe, where states would have well-defined rights but a more formal federal government. Obviously the merits can be debated but it's in my view the only way to oppose other major world powers. European countries individually can have no such power.

I believe that if Swiss firms continue their wage policies for certain sectors (again: I mainly know IT, and in some industries, so take this with a grain of salt) we will be at this point within 5-10 years.  

There are too few, and just to be clear, I am in favor of allowing immigration of skilled workers for exactly the reasons you say.  

The problem is that many companies do not hire people at the wages and rates required to motivate people to get into and stay in certain sectors, and then they bring in people from abroad who may not be familiar with Swiss price levels.  I remember working for a certain medical firm that relocated all of its staff a German research center to central Switzerland.  One guy told me that he pays more in rent than his wife, a qualified pharmacist in Germany, earns in a MONTH.  

Point is, immigration is good, but it needs rules and a system - and not least, companies that understand the long-term impact of their actions.  Good luck.

&gt; For years now we've been cutting off education money and now suddenly we start to wonder why we don't produce enough high skilled workers out of our own Universities/FHs?

If you're looking for an argument from me, you're not going to get one.  It's infuriating.  And don't forget apprenticeships.  I spent fucking MONTHS to get my department to cut through the red tape and bring in a few Lehrlinge.  Think there was any chance of that?

_Edit:_ just to be clear:  I am very, very biased.  I was an IT contractor/consultant for a very long time, and I got my start in a period when you could get a good job by being able to spell ""IT"" and having a pulse.  Pay in the late 1990s and early 2000s could be utterly stupid if you knew how to market yourself.  I won't argue that.  But I think that a lot of companies have lost sight of the fact that really good people are hard to find - and that you need to pay them very well, if you can afford it, if you want to help keep up the supply to your industry in the long run.

We are putting a lot of important trade at risk with this initiative. The thing is, the EU has a lot more leverage over Switzerland than vice versa. Our political and especially our economic strength are very heavily dependent on relations with our close neighbors. Now that we have voted to breach the Schengen Agreement, the EU has a nice free pass to put increased pressure on Switzerland concerning other hot topics like tax havens.

I do not in the least envy the Federal Council their task of making the most of this foreign political mess. What they have to do is damage control of something they fought quite strongly.

My own personal opinion is less on an economical and more on a moral scale. I feel this kind of initiative, like most proposed by the SVP in recent years, is based on fearmongering, the ""them and us"" attitude. We are a large economic hub, even a kingpin in a number of industries and businesses. Nearly our entire wealth and prosperity come exclusively from interactions with foreigners. With other human beings. Yet in stead of welcoming people into this system that we've mastered on so many levels, in stead of attempting to integrate them into it for the benefit of everyone, it appears a good number of people believe themselves entitled to ride out this wave of success without moving over a little bit to leave room for others.

There are a number of reasons why I feel strongly on this subject, but one of the main ones is the fact that I have a good deal of experience with it. I was born in Switzerland to US-American parents and have spent all 22 years of my life here. Until I was 18, I didn't have Swiss citizenship. As an American, I didn't suffer very much prejudice (although post-9/11 things started going downhill with the Afghanistan and Iraq campaigns dominating international news), but the small amount I did experience made me feel very sorry for people moving in from ""undesirable"" localities, particularly Balkan countries.
