&gt;__Ovaltine__ (__Ovomaltine__) is a brand of [milk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milk) flavoring product made with [malt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malt) extract (except the blue packaging in the US), [sugar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sugar) (except in Switzerland), and [whey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whey). Some flavors also have [cocoa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cocoa_solids). Ovaltine, a registered [trademark](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trademark) of [Associated British Foods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_British_Foods), is made by Wander AG, a subsidiary of [Twinings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twinings) which acquired the brand from [Novartis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novartis) in 2003, except in the United States, where [Nestlé](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nestl%C3%A9) acquired the rights separately from Novartis later on.

TIL Ovomaltine is called Ovaltine outside of Switzerland: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovaltine 

&gt; Ovaltine was developed in Berne, Switzerland, where it is known by its original name, Ovomaltine (from ovum, Latin for ""egg,"" and malt, which were originally its main ingredients). Soon after its invention, the factory moved out to the village of Neuenegg, a few kilometers west of Berne, where it is still produced.
&gt;
&gt; Ovomaltine was exported to Britain in 1909; a misspelling of the name on the trademark registration application led to the name being shortened to Ovaltine in English-speaking markets. A factory was built in Kings Langley, which exported it to the United States as well. By 1915, Ovaltine was being manufactured in Villa Park, Illinois, for the US market. Ovaltine was later manufactured in Peterborough, Ontario for distribution in Canada.

That's what all the racists say and it doesn't make any sense. In fact the opposite is true. You're basically saying that we should tolerate racism and xenophobia as long as it isn't too obvious. That's why most of the players of our national team had to grow up with billboards in front of their playgrounds saying 'No to foreigners / Albanians'. But I guess this isn't racist enough for you?! SVP &amp; friends can spread their racism but pointing out racism is 'overdoing' it. All you're saying is 'I'm not a racist but I'm just asking why so many of 'them' are in 'our' national team'.

It does make sense. If you are accusing everybody of racism just because they are talking about different ethnic groups or something, you're disqualifying yourself. It shows that you can't differentiate between racism and talking about races.

&gt; You're basically saying that we should tolerate racism and xenophobia as long as it isn't too obvious.

No. I am saying you should differentiate.  Show me one phrase I wrote that was racist or xenophobe. There isn't a single one.

&gt;All you're saying is 'I'm not a racist but I'm just asking why so many of 'them' are in 'our' national team'.

Actually, the article stated that there are so many of 'them' in the swiss national team. Is the writer racist too?

I guess you've been a victim to racism. I'm sorry that happened to you. But those accusations aren't going to help you. Maybe you should try forgiveness.

I know this might not change your opinion about me. But I'll try anyway. I have friends from the balkan. My girlfriend is from another country and has another skin-color than me. I've spent a lot of my life outside of switzerland with many various kinds of people with many different ethnicities. I am not your typical swiss. I am a very open-minded guy with a lot of love for other peoples cultures and heritage.
