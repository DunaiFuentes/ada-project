true,alexrng,null,null,"one of reason against the knob: kids. once they're big enough to reach that knob you're screwed. this just as a side note, in case you'll have kids in the future you'll maybe think of this again ;) (you will still leave the keys near the door, just out of reach of your probably three year old - and once the kids old enough to understand to not leave the apartment all on its own, you just plug the keys back into the lock from the inside and be done with it)

and how comes that not everyone in the WG has its own key to the door? that is silly. 

in the apartments we rent out we always ask how many people will be living together and hand out the correct amount of keys. if not enough keys are available, we just order more keys from the manufacturer and hand those out. if people leave and the next one doesn't need as many keys, the ones that are too many get locked up in a safe. those extra keys are also very handy if one looses its key to have a replacement key right away.

if one who rents an apartment would like to install their own lock, then we simply take out the old lock and lock it in along with the keys, in case it can be used somewhere else. (unless it's an old one, then we just throw it in the trash)

as for which part of the lock gets precedence if the keys are plucked in, this is up to you. we usually install no-precedence locks though (yep, they exist), unless it's specifically asked for by the one renting the apartment. in that case they get a replacement lock which usually has inside-precedence. only one case of outside-precedence ever occurred. if i'm not mistaken it was an elderly couple where one partner had alzheimers and would otherwise leave the apartment constantly and get subsequently lost in the city, if the partner went out to work.

true,elFlexor,lu,Luzern,"&gt; I would have voted no due to environmental issues.

This is a very valid reason not to have a higher tempo limit especially since it won't avoid congestion, however:

&gt;If you look at Germany, having no limit [...] makes it far more dangerous.

This is simply not true. If you compare road deaths per vehicles in use in Germany and Switzerland, you will find both figures are very similar. In fact, in 2004 Swiss roads were more dangeours than German ones by this measure.

Also your assessment of driver mentalities during rush hour seems very subjective. I can assure you from experience that the impatience and straight up stupidity expressed by Swiss drivers on the Nordring each day at 6pm is in no way inferior to Germans driving at this time around Munich - if not even worse.

I won't take any side here, but consider this about public transport: The more people use it, the more it sucks. At the same time, the less people use the roads, the better it is for an individual to use them. This also works the other way and there is clearly an optimum load for both of them. There is no question that our infrastructure - both public transport and roads - is in constant need of upgrade and restoration.

Widening the already bursting highways to be able to cope with the amount of traffic going through each day and improving rail services so commuters aren't forced to stand like sardines on an hour-long trip are both equally important. At the moment, I feel like we're running close to max capacity in both of these worlds.

Show me that the majority of people on the streets drive careful enough then you can have 140. If that's not the case the cost/benefit doesn't add up. More crashes to save a few minutes?

true,Syndic,so,Solothurn,Well if the speed limit is raised to 140 then they just drive 155 - 160. Those who already drive that fast won't suddenly keep that speed just because it's now legal.

true,flawr,null,null,"As an adrenaline junkie I like driving fast and fast cars. But rationality tells me otherwise: 

The breaking distance when driving 140 instead of 120 will be  1.36 = 14^2 / 12^2 times longer (it is proportional to the kinetic energy ~ velocity^2) while the driving time is only shortened by the factor 1.16 which would make accidents more likely and more severe. (But keep in mind that autobahn-accidents are less likely than accidents in the city.)

An argument that supporters of this campaign often bring up is (basically) ""higher speed limits = less driving time = less cars on the road"" - which is just false. Studies show that the optimal velocity concerning the throuput of cars is about 80 - 85km/h. (This includes calculations about how people react in the formation of traffic jams as well as the likelihood of accidents that cause traffic jams. The basic ideas are pretty obvious: ""higher velocity = more cars"" but also ""higher velocity = more distance to the next car needed = less cars"") but I think some people do not consider the rational thoughts and just follow their emotions. Or try to gain votes by advocating ideas that pleases many people in our society.

Because of this I am really looking forward to self driving cars who do not rely on human reaction.",0,1401358873,null,0,false,0,chtvt7i,t3_26omhc,t1_chtvt7i,t3_26omhc,null,1434002649,13,false,Switzerland,t5_2qhp6,13
