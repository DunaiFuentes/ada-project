true,DeepDuh,zh,Zürich,"&gt; What does a set of typical Swiss people pay for their health care?

I'd say the range is from ~ CHF 150 to ~ CHF 300 per month and person for the mandatory insurance. That's ~5-8% of a typical income. It depends on: 

- Your age (younger is cheaper)

- Your gender (male is cheaper)

- Your chosen deductible (amount you pay annually yourself for medical services). Goes from CHF 300 to 2500.

- Your chosen model for non emergencies (call an insurance number first &lt; only choose certain certified doctors &lt; have a 'home doctor' of your choice pass you on &lt; choose any doctor / hospital).

- Your insurance company (people can switch to the cheapest every year, but many will miss this, which is an important part of these company's strategy). 

Some notes:

- Dentist is not included - need another private insurance for that if you want. Most Swiss don't have an insurance for dentist services.

- Apart from the mandatory system there is the the compulsory 'private' and 'semi private' system (bad naming, every insurance is privately organized anyway). Private is about twice the price. You get your own room at the hospital, better doctors and a golden casket for when those can't help anymore /s. IMO the worst aspect of our system.

- Apart from the base deductible you also need to cover 10% of the exceeding amount, up to a certain point (I think CHF 10k a year or so). Once you've paid that much for your services, everything else is covered fully, even if it costs millions.

&gt; And to what extent are these labeled as taxes?

Not included in taxes at all. You make a contract with a private insurance company, the government regulates the part about those contracts being mandatory, their pricing range and what they must include.",0,1388749878,null,0,false,0,ceg8t37,t3_1uazem,t1_ceg8t37,t3_1uazem,null,1431780041,2,false,Switzerland,t5_2qhp6,2

true,SoulLink,null,null,"Check out this website: http://en.comparis.ch/

It is the central hub for anything insurance related.

&gt; What does a set of typical Swiss people pay for their health care?

Between 200 and 600 CHF monthly for the basic insurance. The amount you pay depends on your age, your postcode, your insurance company [(60 with subsidiaries)](http://www.comparis.ch/krankenkassen/anbieter/default.aspx), your insurance model (Standard, Family doctor, HMO, Telmed, Other), your deductible (300, 500, 1000, 1500, 2000, 2500) and wether or not you want an accident insurance.

This Basic Health Insurance is mandatory for everyone living in Switzerland and [it always covers the same things](http://en.comparis.ch/krankenkassen/info/glossar/leistungen-krankenpflegeversicherung.aspx). [Here an example what the insurancy company pays](http://en.comparis.ch/krankenkassen/info/glossar/kostenbeteiligung.aspx).

In addition to this you can buy additional insurance policies. They cover things that are not covered by the basic insurance (like the dentist or private room in the hospital etc.). You can buy them from any insurance company, they however do not have to offer or sell you anything. Those policies can cost from 20 CHF monthly up to a lot monthly. (Can't find any numbers ;)).

In 2012 every swiss citizen cost 3259 CHF for the insurance company, which is a new record high. There will soon be a vote up to replace the current insurance company system with just one state-run insurance company + companies which offer additional policies. As currently healthcosts are constantly rising and so are health insurance premiums. 

&gt; And to what extent are these labeled as taxes?

They are not taxes. All the companies are privatly owned and run but the [BAG](http://en.comparis.ch/krankenkassen/info/bag-schweiz.aspx) makes sure that the companies act in accordance with the law.

true,Motzlord,tg,Thurgau,"&gt; The monthly fee (premiums) is at least SFr 350 for a cheap company (that's still pretty expensive), but usually we will have to pay more.

This also depends on where you live (cities = more expensive) and how old you are. Also, if you have a higher deductable, the monthly fee will be lower. The cheapest you can find in a big city such as Zürich is around 200 CHF. But that is with a deductible of ~2000 CHF so if you suddenly get something serious, you're fucked. However, accidents are covered by a separate accident insurance which if I'm not mistaken your work has to offer if you work at least a specified amount of hours per week.

true,Aethec,vd,Vaud,"Frankly, the EPFL deals (via Poseidon) aren't that great. The only 15'' laptops are Macs (which are super-expensive, for obvious reasons) or Lenovos with insane graphic cards designed for professional use (NVIDIA's Quadro line), which means they're also expensive. 

Also, the deals are updated once a year maximum, often their rebate is less than what they say it is because the public price changed.

They only offer ""professional grade"" laptops because others apparently break down too easily, which means the base price of the laptops is absurdly high, e.g. the Thinkpad T440 i5 which was added recently to Poseidon's catalog has a retail price of 1,900 CHF for a dual-core processor and an integrated graphics card. (for comparison's sake, I paid 1,250 CHF for a Dell quad-core with a discrete GPU and an SSD cache a year ago)

In the case of Lenovo, I am not sure to understand. The warranty is the standard one, and you can even buy additional coverage from them. Why should Poseidon be involved?

I had screens changed on two different Lenovo machines, after ~18 months of usage in both case, and had a power block changed. Since I am super careful with my machines, and did nothing wrong, they did not argue and it was covered by the warranty.

However, if *you* ""break"" the machine, how can you expect them to cover it? You can buy an additional coverage for that sort of things, but it is a different matter.

In any case, to come back to the topic of discussion, AFAIK, Poseidon acts exactly like a shop, and sells you products (machines, warranties, coverages, etc.) that the manufacturer proposes.

For Lenovo for instance, they specifically state [on this page](http://poseidon.epfl.ch/english/faq/purchases-and-warranties/lenovo/my-lenovo-laptop-appears-broken.html) that if the laptop is broken when it is delivered to you, **you have two business days to contact the vendor** and **you have six days to notify Lenovo**.
