Maybe you should read [**that**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_to_roam). The english wiki isn't as detailed as the german one where you can read much more about your rights. 
There it is written that everybody has the right to camp for one or two nights on uncultivated ground. If the spot is near some appartements / buildings then you'll have to ask the ground owner. It further says that you should dig the ground just as much as needed and have to take care that you don't chance the visual appearance of the place where you're camping. Some cantons have different rights about camping but as long you'll stick to some basic rules (don't disturb anyone, don't leave your trash there...) you won't have problems. Have fun.

&gt;

&gt;The __freedom to roam__, or __everyman's right__ is the general public's right to access certain public or privately owned land for [recreation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recreation) and [exercise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exercise). The right is sometimes called the __right of public access to the wilderness__ or the __right to roam__.
