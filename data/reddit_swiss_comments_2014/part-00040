Yep.. I am one of those asshole Germans..

We integrate ourselves as best as possible. I don't speak Swiss German, but we did our best to learn and I can understand it no problem, so Swiss people can just go on talking and a lot appreciate that.

Now.. why I am not speaking Swiss German is simply because I was already over 30 when we moved here, and I come from an area of Germany where very exact standard German is spoken. I can't even attach myself to intra-German dialects.

Also: The Swiss are very divided over whether a German should even *try* to speak dialect, and quite a few I talked to were absolutely *HORRIFIED* of Germans even trying to.

So.. me and my wife live here, we have a few Swiss friends (which is hard to do, as the Swiss keep to themselves very much), our kid goes to a Swiss Krippe and talks Swiss German when around other Swiss kids.
I get to pay taxes *WITHOUT* being able to vote.

Now, isn't that nice? Having 23% of your population getting to pay taxes but having no say in whatever is happening in the country?

And the days of foreigners being lowly manual workers are over, so you get quite a chunk of money from those dirty foreigners with high paying jobs.

These people also create jobs, as the numbers of companies being founded by foreigners is much higher (per capita) than by Swiss.

But yeah.... let's get shat on instead.

Over the last years, the anti-foreigners sentiment experienced by foreigners has just grown. I had to see graffiti with ""Germans out!"" (Deutsche raus!) even at ETH Zurich University. Media love bashing foreigners more and more. I can be glad I am not of eastern European decent, but as the third most hated group of foreigners (taken form some article a week back), being German in Switzerland feels oh so good.

If all this is getting a cross as being a bit angry or bitter ... so be it.

Then maybe some arrogance and general rejection of the EU. The initiative really only targeted the PFZ. If read naively, the measure doesn't seem unreasonable, but that's only when you don't think about how the EU might react. It's possible that people were okay with taking that risk.

true,smacksaw,null,null,"&gt; Prosperity is only possible with trade and mutual respect / trust.

Apparently there was a lack of reasonable limits in lieu of what you said: ""mutual respect/trust"". Initially Swiss voters expected more moderate immigration numbers and got many magnitudes more than they bargained for.

It kind of reminds me of what Mexico tells the US: ""Mexico doesn't have a Mexican immigration problem, the USA has a Mexican immigration problem.""

It's that sort of glib defiance that allows Mexicans to extract wealth out of the US economy and export it back home rather than Mexico increase it's own prosperity and create it's own wealth. They're basically saying ""Look, Jose and Maria, we can't help you nor are we gonna try. You're on your own.""

So when the US has integrated treaties like NAFTA and a common border and Mexico doesn't respect US law and the US can't trust Mexico, what do you get?

The US is a disaster because it has disorderly immigration. It lacks an effective guest worker (unskilled especially) visa program and has a serf class of mistreated Mexican migrant workers. They get no respect because they can't get proper status and you only need to sample the rhetoric of right-wing Republicans to know how trustworthy they think illegal workers are. 

There's nothing wrong with codifying into law sensible immigration guidelines. ",0,1392027032,null,0,false,0,cfbljen,t3_1xfeu5,t1_cfbljen,t1_cfavv8j,null,1432332741,2,false,Switzerland,t5_2qhp6,2

 [**Black sheep**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black%20sheep): 

---

&gt;

&gt;In the [English language](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_language), **black sheep** is an [idiom](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idiom) used to describe an odd or disreputable member of a group, especially within a [family](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family). The term stems from the genetic effect in [sheep](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheep) whereby a [recessive gene](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recessive_gene) occasionally manifests in the birth of a sheep with black rather than white coloring; these sheep stand out in the flock.

&gt;The term has typically been given negative implications, implying waywardness. It derived from the atypical and unwanted presence of other black individuals in flocks of white sheep.

&gt;In [psychology](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychology), the black sheep effect refers to the tendency of group members to judge likeable ingroup members more positively and deviant [ingroup](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ingroup) member more negatively than comparable [outgroup](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ingroups_and_outgroups) members.

In my opinion, one of two scenarios are most likely: One, the Bundesrat will set the number of work permits high enough that it does not really hurt the free movement of people, so the EU can turn a blind eye and that's it. Of course, the SVP will exploit this claiming that the Bundesrat is ""yet again violating the will of the people"", positing itself for the next general election - which, of course, was the whole point.

The other baseline scenario is this: Switzerland will try to start negotiations with the EU, which will go nowhere. The main problem here is precisely that other EU countries are also involved in discussions to limit the free movement of people, so the EU cannot compromise with Switzerland without risking that EU member countries would start asking for similar exceptions (they learned their lesson from the  Savings Directive!). So, in two to three years time when the time limit of the initiative expires, Switzerland will enact laws that restrict the issuance of work permits in line with the initiative. This will prompt the EU to claim a violation of the bilateral contracts and to suspend the whole package - however, this will most likely also involve additional negotiations and will be a prolonged process taking two to three years, so we are now talking four to six years from now.

When we arrive at this point, the Swiss economy may well find itself in the ""perfect storm"": General uncertainty, loss of export markets and restricted demand on the property market could well combine to fuel a housing crash and an economic downturn. However, four to six years are an eternity and a lot can happen in the meantime: Swiss voters can change their mind, the EU itself might limit the free movement of people due to pressure from e.g. the United Kingdom, the economics on either side of the border can change, the EU might disintegrate as some of its critics claim or hope etc.

&gt;The problem is caused by Swiss politics and not by foreigners..

Meh. It is caused by the massive amounts of foreigners coming over, but it's something politics should be able to solve. Contingents are an option, but not a good one. 

&gt; The foreigners get here because there is demand for their workforce, not because they have all agreed on making your housing space scarce and barely affordable. 

Some. The unemployment rate is easily twice as high for foreigners in Switzerland.

Bigger demand, lower supply, higher prices.

Either way, I believe that the initiative was a very bad idea, but it was time for the politics to pick up the problem. It's just not possible to have the landscape we have and add 70k people every year, a growing number.

Switzerland is not a member state, but has a number of contracts (Called the Billaterale I and II) with the EU regulating trade and other relations. One part of these contracts is that Switzerland too is part of the PFZ-Raum. This has lead to a huge number of immigrants (Around 80'000 per year) to Switzerland. The initiative that was just passed will cause Switzerland to renegotiate the contracts with the EU and reintroduce caps on immigration.
The big question mark is that the Billaterale contracts are packed together (Guillotine clause). Thus, in theory, the EU can negate all contracts when Switzerland tells them that they will no longer adhere to the PFZ. How the EU will react is yet to be seen.

Civil rights take years to be accepted, people are really slow on the uptake on some topics. There are also certain areas where a myopic grass-roots view is detrimental in the long term. Take for instance urbanization projects. If you ask people individually it's always NIMBY that wins, and that's how you end up with huge urban sprawl like in the USA, with crappy public transportation because nothing was planned.

You need the two aspects. Also, pure democracy results in oppression of minorities without some safeguard clauses. Centuries ago those minorities were protected in the form of cantonal votes, to prevent large cantons from ruling over smaller ones. Now the main dividers of society are different than regional divides, they are class divides, race divides, religious divides transcending cantonal borders. And with the majority rule we see these minorities losing rights more and more. It's frightening to think that theoretically we could vote on kicking out all the gays if we so chose, without a safeguard somewhere.

So we have to recognize that even though we may cherish direct democracy, we should be wary of using the voice of the people as the sole arbiter of what is good. The fact that this is also heavily weighed by participation numbers should also give us pause to think.

I personally think that if we have to vote on something that goes counter a treaty we have ratified or an international convention (human rights for example) that we are supposed to adhere to, that we should vote on the initiative but also on repealing the said text. Then people would be forced to say indeed they don't want the European cooperation agreements, or the European convention on human rights, etc., for the initiative to be formally accepted.

Because they lost. The left is generally speaking very pro EU and I guess they feel betrayed by the voters. They are also afraid to be put in the racism corner so they feel the need to speak out loudly.

&gt; I mean, people are demonstrating in Basel and Zürich. 

No substance or relevance here. Just the normal mumbo jumbo of kids.

&gt; I don't want to pick sides here, but 80k a year seem like it was A LOT.

It is. At the core, it is very very valid for a country to limit immigration. What disturbes me is the style of how the campaigns are fought.

&gt; Is it really that bad to set a number, just to have some control over the immigration?

No, it is not. People seem to forget that Switzerland is not part of the EU and has every right to control immigration. As I said before, the big questionmark here is how the EU will react. This might cause quite some problems for a small country like Switzerland. 

&gt; Swiss media describe a lot of disagreement coming from Germany and other EU states and some say that this initiative may have terrible economic consequences. Do you know about this?

The EU is controlled by pro EU beaurocrats and professional politicians, don't forget that. As for the consequences, as I said before all contracts from Billaterale are connected. So when Switzerland terminates PFZ, the EU could in return terminate the other 6 contracts as well. However, this would have a negative economic impact on the EU as well and only bring them the benefit of sending a strong signal. Given that they act rational, I don't really see that happening.

The only part where I think you are not correct is that ""it typically gives you enough time to jump through all the hoops"". The visa has to be renewed after 3 years (renewal was subject to quotas when I did mine), but the green-card process took around 4 years, and I was only able to apply after having been on an H1-B for 2 years. The timeline for the green-card is also subject to preference (education, job, etc) and can sometimes be much quicker and sometimes much longer.

I know the L-1 is another possible path, but given the required preconditions it is not something that is available to most people. There are also the O visas, which are even more difficult to obtain (and also subject to quotas from what I understand, but I could be wrong).

It's pretty hard though to get all the info right. In general the permits are issued on canton level.

* If: ""I as a layman do not know the consequences and neither does anybody else at this point"", the initiative can't be a very good thing, when you don't know the consequences. That's why I call it stupid. In a clever move, you always can at least aproximatly estimate the consequences. Also, I think there is nothing good in this initiative, since it's xenophobic, as it has been pointed out and an economical catastrophy, as it will turn out to be pointed out.
