I had forgotten stuff being sent to me to germany (Paid 50 Francs for next day delivery) and it went straight to the customs office for over a week before they even notified me.  As I had no way of proving that it was actually mine, the only way to get it back was to either pay customs for it (about 20% of value) or to not accept the delivery and thus send it back to Switzerland.

If there is any other way than sending it from Switzerland, I would strongly encourage you to do it that way. I think sending it from a EU country (France?) would be a lot easier.",0,1413587228,null,0,false,0,clcho7q,t3_2jjsm8,t1_clcho7q,t1_clcfdy0,null,1426475711,6,false,Switzerland,t5_2qhp6,6
