true,awh444,usa,USA,"Hey there! Half Swiss guy reporting. I live overseas but I've visited 3 or 4 times now.

I speak only English and Spanish, and honestly the language barrier wasn't a huge problem for me. It's a little bit of a challenge sometimes in terms of sign-reaading and the like, but generally most people will be able to speak English and everything is fairly straightforward. In terms of expenses, everything is fairly costly. It's a pretty high cost of living, and food/activities/travel isn't cheap. Prepare to shell out a decent amount. There are plenty of ways to stretch your dollar if you look in the right places and aim for lower-budget options, but consider yourself warned.

Friendliness (or lack thereof) is one of the main criticisms of the Swiss people. It's true, compared to many other Europeans or Americans, it can seem like they're unwelcoming at times, but it's easy to adjust to. Especially in the regions frequented by tourists, I've found the Swiss people to be very kind and accommodating, if not a bit straightforward.

Switzerland is absurdly easy to travel without a car. Trains are everywhere. They're clean, on time, easy, and frequent. I would use them whenever you can, which won't be difficult. I would say you could travel the country fairly thoroughly with no car. Even where there are no trains, there are other options. For example, I once found myself about 20 minutes outside of Zurich and discovered that I could get into the city by train, bus, or boat, all for the same cost and roughly the same travel time.

I can't speak too much to the actual areas you should visit, but you will find outdoor adventure options aplenty. The scenery is beautiful and the trails are incredible fun everywhere I've hiked. There's nothing quite like it. I've had great times in Grindlewald and Lenzerheide, but those are a bit more touristy, so you may want to investigate further as to local options.

Best of luck with everything!

Edit: In addition to visiting the mountains, I'd say no trip to Switzerland is complete without visiting some city areas. Zurich, Lausanne, and Lugano are all fantastic places to visit, among others. Swiss cities have a great modern vibe in an old-world setting.

So just some notes: Berne is a great place to visit. The city itself is a World Heritage site, in the canton there is the Jungfrau region with places like Grindelwald and Interlaken – so they are very tourism-oriented. Also the people from Berne are said to be a bit friendlier and more open to strangers than in the rest of Switzerland.

Berne is pretty central and a great base for a holiday in Switzerland. In about an hour you can travel to Lucerne, Zurich or Basel, and Geneva and Lausanne can be visited on a day trip.

Don't bother not having a car. Switzerland has great public transport. Check out [sbb.ch](http://www.sbb.ch/en/home.html) (Swiss Railway company). The timetable will help you plan your trip.

A) don't worry about not having a car; trains and buses are exellent (even if not too cheap as everything here)
B) language barrier.... In the cities, it won't be any problem and you will get around just fine with English (especially if you talk to people under 60) In the countryside you might have some problems, but you probably just have to ask a few people until someone dares to talk English to you ;)
C) Expenses... You do not need any additional expenses that you wouldn't need in the States, but expect everything to be twice as expensive as the in US (for a meal plus drink (no refills here either ;) ) in a restaurant expect at least 30 bucks. A starbucks drink: 8$ for a tall)
D) You can actually go hiking everywhere. I have been hiking in the Wallis, the Graubünden, the Tessin/Tecino and a lot of different cantons and everywhere it's just lovely. You don't have to travel far from the cities until you find trekking paths or something. 
E) Visit the cities! Zurich is lovely (haha, I might be a bit biased...), Lucerene is the typical tourist destination, Lugano is lovely also (in the very south in the italian speaking part and thus has a bit of a southern italian feeling, but still swiss efficiency)

For your questions, everybody else already answered quite accurately: you should be able to get around with english quite easily, expect everything to be very expensive, most people are rather 'distant' but not unfriendly at all (except maybe some 60+ old people who panic when spoken to in english), public transportation will get you everywhere (check http://www.sbb.ch/en/home.html, it's pretty straight forward) and you can hike pretty much everywhere. If you have any serious troubles, don't shy back from calling 117 (police, but they'll handle everything for you).",0,1396281508,null,0,1396282141,0,cggi5f3,t3_21sogd,t1_cggi5f3,t3_21sogd,null,1433147827,1,false,Switzerland,t5_2qhp6,1
