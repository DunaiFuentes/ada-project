The hike goes onto a nice peak with a nice view, while remaining accessible for normal people. There are some Swiss alpine club huts in the area (Rothornhütte, Schönbielhütte). The huts are accessible easily. They are mostly used as stepping stone to go up to a high peak (Rothornhütte -&gt; Rothorn), but you don't have to have to hike the peak.

I also remember an excursion, where we (group of three men) hiked the Bishorn (4000m) to glide down using paragliders. As it was high, we hires a guide, but found that it was not really necessary. The weekend we got up there were maybe 100 people hiking the same trail, so we had company. Also the Bishorn has the reputation to be an easy hike, very true, there is no difficulty.

If you go to Lucerne, consider visiting the Hammetschwand lift. You can take a boat from LU and ride the small gear train to the top before hiking to the lift.

What you should do and see: 

* Travel to Locarno from Berne to via Brig and Domodossola to Locarno. (Domodossola is actually in Italy, but you can buy a regular ticket from SBB). You will travel through [Centovalli](http://www.myswitzerland.com/en-ch/centovalli-onsernone.html) which is a spectacular ride. 
* Enjoy Locarno and Ascona which are both nice towns.
* Also visit the slightly bigger Lugano.
* Visit at least one of the following mountains in the Lugano area: Monte Brè, Monte Generoso or San Salvatore. If you like to hike: Go to San Salvatore and walk down to Morcote. Morcote is very nice. 
* As an alternative: Take the boat from Lugano and go to Gandria (also tiny and beautiful)
* If you are into castles and stuff: Visit Bellinzona. It has three castles which are Heritage sites.
* Drive back via Gotthard. The pass (but also the tunnels) are very important in Swiss history.",0,1406569681,null,0,false,0,cja6m79,t3_2bymx0,t1_cja6m79,t3_2bymx0,null,1434942199,7,false,Switzerland,t5_2qhp6,7

But hey, Switzerland is paying ~ 40 Mio CHF per year in development aid to Nepal anyways, so it seemed a fun idea to get some exchange back. However, and that's the kicker, the Bundesamt für Migration prevented the arrangement from happening. The reason being that Sherpas would need an official working permit, which cannot be granted, since a) road building is not one of the core competencies of Sherpas and b) Sherpas do not offer any advanced qualifications that can't be met by a local person.
