Typical leftish bullshit statement - you can make up as many 'rights' as you want, it still doesn't change reality.

true,whitepalms85,null,null,"&gt; I did not find any data to confirm your claim and I am pretty sure it's not true. 

To be fair, my statement was wrong in a sense that not all of the flats are 'owned' by the government but just some and others are (directly or indirectly) subsidized. 

[Currently a quarter of the flats are 'gemeinnützig' and this will increase to a third.](http://www.limmattalerzeitung.ch/limmattal/region-limmattal/ein-anteil-von-15-prozent-ist-wenig-realistisch-128216907)

&gt; The reason rents are high is because it's an attractive place to live and work in and there is a limited amount of space to do those things in.

Not really, you could just build higher. I don't even mean skyscrapers simply add a few floors. Zurich is build extremely low for a city. Also not everyone has to live directly in the center. There is still plenty of space.

&gt; Unregulated, the living space in Zurich would be way more expensive and a lot of people could not afford to live in the city anymore... This would be worse than the present situation, in my opinion at least.

Why? Prices would only increase temporarily because it would make building additional flats more attractive too (which would decrease prices in the long run). Also there is no right to live in the center of city with the highest live standard on the planet. It's not the Oerlikon is hell or so. People just want to live in the city without paying for it. Why do I have to subsidiary the flats of other people? Basically, you need connections to get a good flat in Zurich, which it totally unfair. Even if I work hard so that I can afford a good flat, I won't get one just because some other lazy guy is friends with someone. That's not fair at all...

I am definitely considering it. Have you been there? What would you recommend as ""base camp"" - Klosters, Davos, St. Moritz, something else?
