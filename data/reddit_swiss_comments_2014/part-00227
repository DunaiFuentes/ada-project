I really like the val des Dix and it's neighbor, the val d'Hérens, with the [Grande Dixence dam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grande_Dixence_Dam). A nice tour you can do in two day is going from the Dam to with a night at the [Dix Hut](http://www.cabanedesdix.ch/) or simply going to the hut from Arolla and back the next day, if you don't want the long flat walk next to the Dix lake and the transport problem you might have. It's about four hours each day but it is in high mountain, the conditions might change really fast, so don't go there with no equimpent at all (good shoes, clothes for all weather,...)

You can find a good amount of hike on the first site and if you want more info on a region, call the tourist office.

&gt;

&gt;The __Grande Dixence Dam__ is a concrete [gravity dam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravity_dam) on the Dixence River at the head of the [Val d'Hérens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Val_d%27H%C3%A9rens) in the canton of [Valais](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valais) in [Switzerland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switzerland). At 285 m (935 ft) high, it is the [tallest gravity dam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tallest_dams_in_the_world) in the world and is part of the Cleuson-Dixence Complex. With the primary purpose of [hydroelectric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydroelectric) power generation, the dam fuels four power stations, totaling the installed capacity to 2,069 MW, generating approximately 2,000 GWh annually, enough to power 400,000 Swiss households.

&gt;The dam withholds Lac des Dix (Lake Dix), its [reservoir](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reservoir). With a surface area of 4 km², it is the second largest lake in Valais and the largest lake above 2,000 m in the [Alps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alps). The reservoir receives its water from four different pumping stations; the Z’Mutt, Stafel, Ferpècle and Arolla. At peak capacity, it contains approximately 400,000,000 m^3 (1.4×10^10 cu ft) of water, with depths reaching up to 284 m (932 ft).  Construction on the dam began in 1950 and was completed in 1964, before officially commissioning in 1965.

true,buyacasha,zh,Zürich,"&gt; Again: she's a secretary, not a member of the parliament.

Of course, I get that. It would be ""worse"" if she was the president of a major party, it would be less of a problem if she was the intern that brings the croissants once a week. In my opinion, she has enough affiliation with the parliament for it to be a problem.

&gt; Does this mean that you should get fired from your job as soon as your hobbies/ideas become public?

Depends on what they are. The very fact that we are having this discussion right now and that she has been on the front page of several national newspapers makes it evident that it is in fact a problem. Whether it should or shouldn't be really is irrelevant to me.

&gt; Actually, I'm not so sure about this. I bet with you that a majority of folks in this country watch porn regularly and don't have a problem with her stuff.

As I wrote before, we're definitely getting there. But we are absolutely not there yet. Sexuality and it's public expression is still somewhat of a taboo.
