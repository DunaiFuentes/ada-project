Relevant quote:

&gt; It's impossible to make a post on the Internet about the financial crisis, or even anything economic in general, without being bombarded by ""Peter Schiff was right!!11!!"" videos.[14] For the new Austrians (i.e., 19-year-olds who read a few newsletters over at the von Mises Institute and think they have achieved enlightenment), the Austrian-influenced investor Peter Schiff's prediction of the housing bubble was vindication of all things Austrian.  
They believed they had finally shown all other economic theories to be utterly bankrupt and discredited. This is massively ironic for a number of reasons.  

&gt; First, Peter Schiff is still horrifically wrong about many things.[15]

&gt; Second, Austrians have continuously predicted the economic end times and Weimar-style hyper-inflation as they will never be satisfied with the American economy until all regulation is lifted, the Fed is abolished, and we return to a gold standard. Only then will doom be averted. Of course, it's easy to be a Cassandra when all you predict is doom. (In short, even a stopped clock can be right twice a day.)

&gt; Third, they overlook the metric buttload of economists and financial guys who also saw it coming.[16] Those guys just weren't put on CNBC alongside the Wall Street cheerleaders. Even one of Dubya's own economic advisers, Greg Mankiw, warned of problems at Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac back in 2003.[17] Hell, firms like Goldman Sachs were shorting their own securities[18] — the bubble was apparently not a big mystery to insiders.

&gt; Fourth, the Austrians claim that their immutable laws of economics are not ""scientific"" in the sense that they are not empirically derived like the laws of physics, and thus are not subject to falsification and do not make predictions, but ""illustrate history"" (whatever that means). Yet they are now claiming victory over finally making a correct and falsifiable prediction!

Unfortunately Austrians is a broad term, of which includes and is dominated by ideologically Aristotelian normative anarchists, of which that premise in itself (that is believing that normative ethical laws can be identified within secular society), greatly questions whether any of them understand Mises's epistemology in the first place.

Just to defend Mises (Not the Mises institute) for a second though:

&gt;  immutable laws of economics are not ""scientific"" in the sense that they are not empirically derived like the laws of physics, and thus are not subject to falsification and do not make predictions, but ""illustrate history"" (whatever that means). 

Immutable laws are reference to the proposition that ""humans act"", which is an Analytic Proposition, and can thus be considered apodictic in that sense. Mises does explicitly state though that proving the pan-physical doctrine is of course possible (not plausible), and so there is falsification.

There are no exportable natural resources in the country, we make our money from services and exports of value-added manufactured goods.

The Frank is a fiat currency, but due to the Swiss fiscal policy, it is more credible than pretty much any other major currency on the market.

Now, in order for our economy to function, we need to be able to sell our products on foreign markets. In order for that to be possible, our products need to be priced competitively. If the Frank becomes more expensive, our exports go down, and our economy contracts. That's why the Swiss National Bank has vowed to keep the Frank above 1.20€. I don't particularly like this fact, but it's better than the alternative. Considering its international credibility, the SNB is able to achieve this with fairly minimal expense -- it is, in fact, acting out of a position of strength.

If we were required to hold a certain percentage of our reserves in gold, the SNB would lose all credibility regarding this minimal exchange rate, the value of the Frank would skyrocket, nobody could afford to buy our exports, and the Swiss economy would collapse. That's not worth it just in order to cater to your warm-and-fuzzy political feelings.
