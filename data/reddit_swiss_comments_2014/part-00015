In three days you can cover lots of terrain in Switzerland. Do you travel by car or train ?

You talk about night in Italy for a Night. This probably implies a car. It also my be a distraction (detour to get to Italy).

Some suggestions:

* If the weather is nice travel to the Pilatus: www.pilatus.ch. Excellent view of the alps. Just 2h travel time by train from Zürich main station.

* Spend a night in Interlaken/Wengen/Mürren. Also 2h by train from Zürich.
Options: Take the Montreux-Oberland-Bahn on the way there. This is a big detour, but very scenic.

(1) There is an offer aimed specificaally at international tourists called the Swiss Pass, and it comes at a substantial price. It costs CHF272 according to the SBB website and is basically a ticket that allows you to board and get off wherever you want, whenever you want. I though would say that you are much better off buying one of those, just to put it into perspective, a return ticket to Lugano is CHF124, a return ticket to the base station of the Schilthorn funicular is CHF85, and you get 50% off the funicular fare.
(2) If you want to view the weather forecasts there is the webpage [MeteoSchweiz](http://www.meteoschweiz.admin.ch/web/en.html), which is the government meteorological organization with daily, very accurate, forecasts, also available in english. I also seem to remember that there is an archive if you wanna have a look at the average march temperatures. Though be aware, it can be very cold, espescially on Schilthorn, which is just shy of 10'000ft in altitude, and even in march it can get to temps as low as -20 centigrade or just under zero farenheit, if that gives you a better comparison.
