true,P1r4nha,zh,Zürich,"I guess it might be doable technologically, but I wonder if it's feasible to vote on all these things. Most issues are boring and quite clear cut and asking the people for their opinions would be a huge overhead. How much time would you give the people to discuss the issue before they can vote and how long can they vote until there is a decision made?  
In the current system if the parliament actually does decide something you don't like, you do a referendum. If they won't discuss the issue you feel so strongly about, do a initiative.

I think it does make sense to not let anybody post an proposal, but that there needs to be some organizing effort beforehand, namely gathering the signatures. It's a selection mechanism that would need to be replaced with something else if we would switch to a totally direct system. Or else you would have to vote (signature-wise) on hundreds of ideas every day and probably several dozen issues and laws.

This would slow down the whole system even more and I think only very few people would actually use the system and be well informed on all matters of politics.

Nevertheless, technology does help us to find representatives that seem to think similar on the same issues as us. We can easily look up what they will vote on, and who voted what on which issue. The source material is there, there is even video of many legislative meetings. And the best part is you can get all this information quickly and easily. You can contact each and every one of your representatives easily via email and the nice part about Switzerland: You can easily run into them and have a beer with them, talking about issues.

Our politicians are also not professional politicians so they're less out of touch then the ones of other countries (at least relatively).

Where I would like to see technology moving into the lawmaking cycle, is at the voting booth. Instead of sending letters or throwing little pieces of papers into ballot boxes, we should just develop a secure, open-source voting system, but keep the rest of the system the same.",0,1409405090,null,0,false,0,ck4lczy,t3_2f02s0,t1_ck4lczy,t3_2f02s0,null,1427284256,6,false,Switzerland,t5_2qhp6,6

I'd like to address a few things.

First of all: the current system isn't bad at all. I just think, it might be better. Yes, we've got Referendum and Initiative, both quite good instruments to take influence. But frankly, would you really consider going through all the paperwork and pain to use one of those instruments if it wasn't for something that really really bothers you - or even then?

You are absolutely right, you can't go through the process of voting for every little thing. And you certainly can't expect people to have an opinion on every little thing either. That's why the voting process would be different. No big national votings for small stuff. It would happen online, without much effort and only by people who want to participate. I'd call this the dynamic parliament. Just a bunch of people coming together to discuss and decide a certain bill (a bunch of people means everyone who wants to participate). If anyone's got a problem with that afterwards, there will still be a Referendum! Only certain things would have to be decided by the whole nation (just like it is today).

Actually, I wouldn't change much. I'd just replace the parliament by those ""dynamic parliaments"". There would still be a Bundesrat, there would still be a Referendum. There will still be certain bills that have to pass national (or cantonal) votings.

1. In regards of voting via electronic means, I'm a bit worried that it could be exploited/compromised.

Things might turn into a ""shithole"" as you say, but I'd rather have an honest shithole than nothing at all. It almost seems like some kind of social experiment and it probably shouldn't start with all the power at once.

The second point might just be the biggest weakness of the whole system if not done properly. It has to be designed very cautiously and carefully with several layers of security built in. If the system can be compromised or even if it's not easy to use by everyone, the whole thing cannot work at all.

&gt;

&gt;The USA PATRIOT Act has generated a great deal of controversy since its enactment.

&gt;Opponents of the Act have been quite vocal in asserting that it was passed opportunistically after the [September 11 attacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/September_11_attacks), believing that there would have been little debate. They view the Act as one that was hurried through the Senate with little change before it was passed. (Senators [Patrick Leahy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Leahy) and [Russell Feingold](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell_Feingold) proposed amendments to modify the final revision.)   

&gt;The sheer magnitude of the Act itself was noted by [Michael Moore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Moore) in his controversial film *[Fahrenheit 9/11](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fahrenheit_9/11)*. In one of the scenes of the movie, he records Congressman [Jim McDermott](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_McDermott) alleging that no Senator read the bill  and John Conyers, Jr. as saying, ""We don't read most of the bills. Do you really know what that would entail if we read every bill that we passed?"" Congressman Conyers then answers his own rhetorical question, asserting that if they did it would ""slow down the legislative process"".  As a [dramatic device](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dramatic_device), Moore then hired an [ice-cream van](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ice-cream_van) and drove around Washington, D.C. with a loud speaker, reading out the Act to puzzled passers-by, which included a few Senators.
