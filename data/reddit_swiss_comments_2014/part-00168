true,rmesh,zh,Zürich,"&gt; Everyone is hyping Belgium who is in a similar position, but dismissing Switzerland altogether.

Exactly! Just look at [this AskReddit-thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/27yijh/who_do_you_think_will_win_the_world_cup_and_why/). Everyone (well, the serious one's at least..) is gushing about the Belgians being the underdogs, whereas *not one* person thinks Switzerland could be winning. I think we're being fairly under-estimated by others.

Now, to be honest, as much as I'm a fan of our Nati here, I think we can all be realistic here and agree that we won't be winning this thing. But alas, this doesn't mean we won't advance! I think we now have the best team in regards to the last few world cups and I think we might as well have a chance at the achtelfinal.",0,1402666384,null,0,false,0,ci6j11z,t3_27u4rt,t1_ci6j11z,t1_ci4rifg,null,1434221223,1,false,Switzerland,t5_2qhp6,1
