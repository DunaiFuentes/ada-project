But in reality, Ecopop just tries to emotionally convey that it will solve these problems (and others), but actually just introduces a stupid, steel-hard limit on immigration in the constitution (which is a big deal) coupled with a just as stupid and rigid minimum to spend on ""familly planning"" in foreign aid.

If we want to tackle the above-mentioned real problems, we should introduce suitable legislation piece-by-piece for each problem seperately (higher price of gas, higher taxes for foreign companies, state-sponsored affordable housing reserved for low income, etc. (debatable)).

false,hikari-boulders,null,null,"It's value could be derived from the fact that other nations don't view the Swiss franc as ""imaginary ballooned value"", and will not attach a small price to the Swiss franc. 

For example, why did the Euro fall from 1.80 CHF to 1.20 CHF? One day, the Euro had a ""value"" of 1.80 CHF and everybody believed in the magic Euro. Then some newspapers printed that, in fact, the greeks don't like to work until the age of 65 and the spaniards have a high unemployment and god knows what's going on in Italy.
Suddenly people asked ""why is the Euro 1.80?"" Boom, its value drops doooooown. Theoretically it could drop to 0.01 CHF which would be akin to thinking ""I don't really believe that the EU has anything of value"". With a gold standard this could never happen, as the value of the currency can never drop below the value of gold.

But let's take another, less apocalyptic, and more realistic example. Let's say we have 20% of our Aktiven in gold and the other 80% in ""belief"", and we are not allowed to sell the gold. For simplicity say the SNB has 1000 CHF in Aktiven, and hold 200 CHF worth of gold, and 800 CHF in ""belief"". For an outsider this looks like Switzerland has 1000 CHF of ""money"". Why would you want to sell the gold? Obviously you want to sell it so you can give it to someone. Can't you just give him something out of the 800 CHF?",0,1415628398,null,0,false,0,clydfu6,t3_2lrels,t1_clydfu6,t1_clybdhc,null,1426097355,1,false,Switzerland,t5_2qhp6,1
false,markus_b,vd,Vaud,"On the Swisscom network it probably is. If you are a SwisscomTV subscriber, then you are probably even happy about it and would be very rapidly very unhappy if the TV you are watching is stuttering.

I don't know where the potential bottlenecks are these days. I suspect the downstream bandwidth is probably sufficient, so it is not you watching Netflix vs your neighbor watching SwisscomTV. 

But if Netflix grows rapidly it may be that the incoming link into the Swisscom network is not expanded fast enough, like it happened in the US with several carriers. So it would be you watching Netflix vs your neighbor watching Amazon video. Which one should QOS prefer ?

In the US the solution was TWC/Verison/etc ex-torquing money from Netflix to increase the interconnection bandwidth. Actually, as Netflix I'd add these interconnection fees directly to my customers bills. If you are on TWC you pay an additional 30ct 'TWC tax'. This mostly to show to the consumers how shitty their ISPs are. We'll see what happens here. 

There is one important difference: Here in Switzerland I can change ISP, this is very limited in the US. Most places here have one cable (often Cablecom) and multiple DSL providers.
