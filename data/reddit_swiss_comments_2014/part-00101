true,Georgy_K_Zhukov,null,null,"[Quoting from here:](http://candrsenal.com/rifle-swiss-karabiner-1931/)

&gt;The key difference in the K31 is its shortened bolt. In the earlier Model 1911s, the bolt body protrudes from the collar, along with a long, Mauser-like extractor.  For the K31, the extractor was mounted flush with the bolt body and both were set down inside the collar.  This not only shortens the bolt but also strengthens the action by providing forward locking lugs flush with the bolt face.  Another small but important change was the handle being changed over from somewhat fragile bakelite to strong aluminum.

&gt;Redesigned from the simple lever mechanism found in the Schmidt-Rubins to provide a smoother pull, the trigger of the K31 utilized a two stage design, with the trigger spring connected to a sear that made contact with a lug on the striker. The receiver was also shortened just under two inches thanks to the reduction in the length of the bolt and  received a bluing often remarked on for its appearance of depth and all feature a ‘Swiss Cross on a Shield’ stamping. The redesigned bolt and receiver also allowed the magazine to be seated further back, just in front of the trigger, as opposed to a few inches up as found in the Schmidt-Rubins.  This further improved the rifle as centering the cartridge weight means that empty or full, the gun has the same balance.  Although designed with a removable, 6-round box magazine – same capacity as the earlier Model 1911s, the Swiss soldiers were not generally issued with extra magazines, and instead would reload their rifles using stripper clips.",0,1397084436,null,0,false,0,cgohcn8,t3_22lt89,t1_cgohcn8,t1_cgoh7cm,null,1433285827,1,false,SwissGuns,t5_2wug1,1
