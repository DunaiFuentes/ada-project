I use a great Canadian company called ""AdFree Time"". For $2/mo they reroute my DNS (basically location info, but not the stream itself) to any country I choose! I have an Apple TV and use it to watch the Canadian Netflix for show X, or the US Netflix for show Y...Brazil, Sweden, etc. there's even an option to block the subtitles!! I highly recommend the service (has an app too) as it is easy and cheap to do. 

Furthermore, I use moreflicks.com to search all the netflix libraries to find the shows that I like to watch--then I change the country on AdFree and a few minutes later it's playing.

true,ArthurTrollington,null,null,"She will likely be nervous about your country and thus it's best to greet her in traditional Swiss garb. You find examples of that [here](http://www.jodlerfest-davos.ch/). 

Also, her stomach will probably not be used to American food. Try to serve cheese fondue every night, or at least until she's adapted. For snack times, make certain you get lots of ""Swiss Cheese"" from your local grocery store. You can also help her feel welcome by playing Alphorn music or Swiss Yodelling at mealtimes.

Swiss people won't be used to traditional US cutlery, so it's best to just leave out two Swiss army knives, rather than a knife and fork. She'll be truly grateful for this little piece of home.

This one is important - make certain that she has a cuckoo clock in her bedroom. Many Swiss people can't sleep unless they have this comfort near to them.

As a Swiss person, she'll offer to hold your valuables while you go and do dangerous things. This is normal. If you want to seem particularly cultured, set your gold jewellery out in her room with a sign saying ""Raubgold"". It will help make her feel as though she's a valued member of your household.

Finally, don't expect her to have the same sense of timing that you do. Make certain you tell your Swiss guest that things will be starting at least an hour before you actually want them to be ready. She won't mind the last minute delay and will actually appreciate having the extra time.
