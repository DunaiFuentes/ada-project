&gt;

&gt;The __Trummelbach Falls__ (In German: *Trümmelbachfälle*) in [Switzerland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switzerland) are a series of ten glacier-waterfalls inside the mountain made accessible by tunnel-lift and illuminated.

&gt;The Trummelbach alone drains the mighty [glacier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glacier) [defiles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defile_(geography\)) of [Eiger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eiger) (3970 m), [Mönch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C3%B6nch) (4099 m) and [Jungfrau](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jungfrau) (4158 m) and carries 20,200 tons of boulder detritus per year.

&gt;Its drainage area is 24 km², half of it covered by snow and glaciers. The falls carry up to 20,000 litres of water per second.

&gt;

&gt;__Le Locle__ is a [municipality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communes_of_Switzerland) in [Le Locle District](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Le_Locle_District) in the [Canton of Neuchâtel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canton_of_Neuch%C3%A2tel) in Switzerland.

&gt;It is situated in the [Jura Mountains](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jura_Mountains), a few kilometers from the city of [La Chaux-de-Fonds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Chaux-de-Fonds). It is the third smallest city in Switzerland (in Switzerland a place needs more than 10,000 inhabitants to be considered a city).

&gt;Le Locle is known as a center of Swiss [watchmaking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watchmaking), even cited as the birthplace of the industry, with roots dating back to the 1600s.  The municipality has been home to manufactures such as [Mido](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mido_(watch\)), [Zodiac](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zodiac_Watches), [Tissot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissot), [Ulysse Nardin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulysse_Nardin), [Zenith](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zenith_(watchmaker\)) as well as [Universal Genève](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Gen%C3%A8ve), before the latter company relocated to [Geneva](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geneva). The town's history in watchmaking is documented at one of the world's premier horological museums, the [Musée d'Horlogerie du Locle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mus%C3%A9e_d%27Horlogerie_du_Locle), [Monts Castle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monts_Castle), located in a 19th-century country manor on a hill north of the city  Restored historic underground mills (grainmill, oilmill, sawmill) can be seen in a cave located about one kilometer (0.6 miles) west of the city center.

true,blackkettle,null,null,"I think 'very, very, very loud' is probably a little over the top.  The hostel is probably in a super old building though that is not well insulated against sound.  Aside from the once-every-three-years summer festival, most of the festivals here are pretty tame in my opinion.

Here is a link to the Niederdorf festival:

Yeah it's loud as they play music outside and as you can see from the program they finish only around 2am. I don't know where exactly your hostel is, but if it's the one in the Niederdörfli you gonna be right on top of it.

It's not a big party like the Züri Openair that will also be on that weekend and also not like the Zürifäscht which doesn't take place this year, but it's a bit more alternative and comfortable. People will sit and listen to the music and it's overall quite cool.",0,1408996297,null,0,false,0,ck089sr,t3_2ejwtq,t1_ck089sr,t3_2ejwtq,null,1427363111,1,false,Switzerland,t5_2qhp6,1
