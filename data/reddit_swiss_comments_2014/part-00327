Also it's true that the rich are getting richer relative to the rest but this is also a bit of a questionable measure. E.g. equality is increasing on a global scale. Not too long ago, rich people would earn firms that were mainly doing business in their home country but that changed since the 90s. It's not very surprising that someone that owns a global business is now much wealthier. Owing a global firms means much more profit than owning a local firm because it's  much bigger market.

You are correct. However, us Swiss have gotten a bit more accustomed to the German version, so it's just a small faux pas these days. And it depends on the situation. If you're shopping and the cashier is young (assuming you are) then it's perfectly fine to say ""Hallo"" and ""Tschüss"", this basically applies to all other circumstances where you'd have young people (no matter if your age or younger) as well. But don't say ""Hallo"" when going to an interview, for instance. ;)

But: If you can't say Grüezi without sounding like a German, then don't. Then some people will probably smirk. Just so you know, it's not pronounced ""Krühzih"". Depending on the dialect, it's more like ""Grüätzi"". And the G is really a soft sound, not hard like a K.

Grüezi means Guten Tag, so it's more formal. The problem is that Grüezi seems to be kind of hard to pronounce for Germans, also a lot of Germans say 'Grüüzi' or something like that. I'd rather say Guten Tag, (Guten) Morgen or something like that. Hallo is less common in situation where you don't know the person but still quite okay, especially with people younger than 40. Tschüss is quite informal, I would rather say 'Auf Wiedersehen', 'Schönen Tag'. I never use Adieu, it sounds a bit outdated to me but a lot of people still use it.

That's very true. The Swiss are very extreme when it comes to regional differences. Basically everyone hates everyone, we're worse than the Scots. E.g. countryside people hate people from the cities ('arrogant hipster and banker that think they know everything'), city people look down on countryside people ('uneducated, racist farmers'). Inner city people make fun of suburb people ('wannabe cosmopolitans'), suburbs look down on city people ('leftish students that all depend on the state'). Cities hate each other too (e.g. Zurich and Basel people don't like each others). Everyone hates Zurich. Zurich looks down on everyone else. Also all the different languages kind of hate each other (e.g. the German speakers think that the French are all lazy left wingers, some far right magazine called them the 'Greeks of Switzerland'). The people from the countryside are even more extreme, if you're from a different valley, you're a foreigner. Obviously it's not open hatred and you shouldn't take it too serious but the Swiss are very anti-integration e.g. even after 10 years in Zurich a Basler will remain a Basler. It's not like in Berlin or London, where you're kind of automatically a part of it.

Assuming you're gonna be in the German-speaking part: One difference that often eludes Germans is that speaking dialects has no rural/uneducated/primitive connotations whatsoever. They are spoken everywhere by everyone through all social, education and income classes.

Expat Germans I have interacted with in Switzerland and elsewhere have a tendency to compare whatever they find to the way it's done in Germany. Resist that temptation. Nobody cares how you do it in Germany, and pointing it out sounds like *""und morgen die ganze Welt.""* You can lose a lot of sympathy and goodwill that way.

E.g. transferring from a BSc business at FH to MSc economics at a uni is not possible but MSc in business is fine (I think you need a GPA of 5 minimum, uni Zurich makes you do two additional semesters, I think St. Gallen even three but Lucerne is just one). However, this is just the concept, for specific information you need to check the websites of the schools or even contact them because it all depends on you subject, the school and so on... As a general rule: it's harder to transfer to school the better their reputation and if they are public (e.g. HSG and ETH make it intentionally hard).",0,1414950715,null,0,false,0,clqx6w0,t3_2kzjf3,t1_clqx6w0,t3_2kzjf3,null,1426227399,2,false,Switzerland,t5_2qhp6,2
