---

&gt;Because 70mm film and projectors are costly and difficult to mass produce, IMAX debuted a digital projection system in 2008. It uses two projectors that can present either 2D or 3D content in [DCI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Cinema_Initiatives) or IMAX Digital Format (IDF) (which in itself is a superset of DCI). As of 2012 [update], IDF uses 2K-resolution [Christie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christie_(company\)) projectors with [Texas Instruments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_Instruments)' [Digital Light Processing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Light_Processing) (DLP) technology alongside parts of IMAX's proprietary formats. The two 2K images are projected over each other to make the image brighter.

true,P1r4nha,zh,Zürich,"&gt; If you think about it, a minimum reserve makes no sense if the banks could create their own money because they'd just use the money they just created as a part of their reserve. Even if that reserve had to be physical in your example, the banks would just hoard every bit of cash they can get because it would allow them to create even more money. 

I think it's a misunderstanding of what ""creating money"" really means. A bank can lend more money than it borrowed from the SNB, but that doesn't mean they really created that money, some people probably would call that ""creating"" though.

Obviously this process is entirely controlled through the SNB controlling the interest rate of the money they lend away.

2. They interviewed me too. First I had to write a small text about me (what I do / what I like ... [will be shown to the voters of your town]) and then they asked me questions like:  
- What would you do if you accidentally broke your neighbors windows with a ball?  
- How to use public transportation?  
- How does the education system work?  
- Some geographical questions like: What would you show to a visitor of your town (like attractions ...)  
- What do you study or where do you work?    
- Are you in a local club?    
- What are you going to do in the future?  
- What is the emergency number for [...]?

So overall pretty easy, BUT let me tell you this: they will try almost everything to not give you a passport.  
3. In some areas the voters will vote for or against you. So you can repeat the whole process again in the far future.
