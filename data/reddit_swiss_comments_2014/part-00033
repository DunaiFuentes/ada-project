true,NyoTheNeko,vd,Vaud,"So I am going to vote no for the abortion thingy (come on, we don't need a debate about being for or against abortion in 2014), no for the trains (because a LOT of rails that are in dire NEED of getting better are untouched by this thing. This infuriates me! Moreover, they want to make us pay more taxes (well, less money on our salary at least!) for something that doesn't mean a lot better to me) and then yes about immigration.

Now, before you hit me, let me explain this yes to you. Because I sure as hell do not like to be voting like UDC/SVP but if you read the thing closely, even if their posters are absurd and stinking with racism, you see that on the contrary, the initiative makes a lot of things better. I mean, sure there is a consensus to be installed, but the text doesn't say of how much and it can be as heigh as you want! Moreover, having the bilateral arrangements seen again seems like a very good plan to me!
Because as I read a lot of you saying, voting yes would mean to close Switzerland to foreigners, but it seams like the contrary to me! Right now, Switzerland is closed to ALL non-EU citizens that want to work and INTEGRATE here. Which means 80% (random number, but you get the point) of our immigration, which do NOT come from the EU! Thus, they have less chance to have a happy life and jobs here, BECAUSE of these bilateral arrangements! If everyone had the same chance to get a job in Switzerland and have a happy life here, I'm all for it!

So I have to say, I am kind of sad to see so many people say no here, because it just means you don't see the long term good it can do, but just UDCs/SVPs hate-filled campaign.",0,1391472696,null,0,false,0,cf6c8f0,t3_1vh6qx,t1_cf6c8f0,t3_1vh6qx,null,1432239929,0,false,Switzerland,t5_2qhp6,0
