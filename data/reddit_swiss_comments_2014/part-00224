Corviglia has the widest runs but it's expensive. Arosa is pretty much the whole package but a bit cheaper. Last year they merged with Lenzerheide so the area is HUGE.

maybe that's a realistic goal.

&gt; companies that once invested in the region

probably pretty impractical, but still manageable (with huge effort). Just think of the very complex - almost inceptive - structure of modern global multi-brand, multi-branch businesses: e.g. let's say Chrysler (Automobiles) buys some products from an Israeli factory AND has given them some credit to build-up their capacity... Does this mean **Fiat** (the **Italien** Automobiles, which owns Chrysler) should be on your list?

&gt; companies owned by a Jew

besides the really gross taste of Antisemitism (boycott the Jews!) and historic cringe-worthyness (Reichskristallnacht!), this point is clearly impossible to perform.

I see two reasons: 1. USA (= Lots of products are imported from the USA, and as there are many ppl of Jewish descent...), 2.
