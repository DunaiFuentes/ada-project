**Weather**

Weather in Switzerland tends to be unstable because of the close mountain ranges. Whenever you visit there's always a substantial chance for bad weather. It is thus recommended to have a somewhat flexible schedule: Visit the mountains when the forecast is good and have a few activities planned for when it's not. For example, visiting the old towns in Gruyere, Berne, Lucerne, Zurich and Locarno (among others), Museums (Fondation Beyeler, Basel; Kunsthaus Zürich; Rosengart Museum Lucerne) and castles (Lenzburg, Chateau Chillon in Montreux) are good ways to spend rainy days. Staying in Berne or Lucerne is a good way to have most of that in reach of a daily trip while being close enough to the mountains to make it there in time (get up really early!).",0,1416316102,null,0,false,0,cm5wxg9,t3_2ml8qp,t1_cm5wxg9,t3_2ml8qp,null,1425967709,7,false,Switzerland,t5_2qhp6,7
