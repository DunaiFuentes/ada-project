- Gruy√®re plus Mol√©son Mountain. (Not too far from GE)
Morning you can visit Gruy√®re, less tourists.
You can check the old village, the Castle (the video presentation is nice and quite poetic), the Giger (the creator of alien) Museum and Caf√©. Dont forget to try the meringue avec double cr√®me there.
In the afternoon you can drive to the bottom of Mol√®son, about 15 mins from Gruy√®re.
There you can climb with a small tram and then telepherique and hike on the top or just hike bottom to the top if you are up to it.


- Neuchatel lake plus Creux du Van.
Also not far from GE (less than 2 hrs driving).
Creux du Van offers an amazing scenery and you can hike there.


- Lucerne plus Hammetschwand Lift.
Lucerne is considered by some as the most beautiful city in CH.
The transportation museum there is nice if you are into it, good for a raining day.
The Hammetschwand Lift is the highest elevator in Europe, you can drive there or take the boat from Lucerne to the bottom of the mountain, then take the small geared train to the top and hike the rest


- Fribourg has a nice old city
- Berne too, also forget the bears there. They were always sleeping whne i visit, lazy bears. lol


- You can take the boat from GE to Montreux if you like.


- FurkaPass and GrimselPass
if you like driving and scenery, you must check out FurkaPass and the Glacier.
From GE you drive through Valais, go direction Brig then follow the signs.
Then you can come back through GrimselPass to arrive near Interlaken.
Lauterbrunnen is not far.


- in the Valais you have some nice places to hike like: Sanetsch, Bisse de Savi√®se, and the dam (which i always forget the name, damn)


- Schwarsee is a nice and pictoresque little lake, very popular.
You can swim, At the top of the telepherique you can rent and descend with some kind of offroad trotinette, quite fun.
There are trail tracks there.
