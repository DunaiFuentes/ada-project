You'll get your mountain trip in at the same time as snowboarding, so why not 2 days of boarding. :)  I'd spend the first day traveling to a resort, next day boarding, and then the last day boarding and returning by train.  Hotel shouldn't have any problem holding onto your luggage for the day you need to check out.

Don't worry about rental.  There are well stocked rental shops at every resort.

If you must stay in Zurich, ski on the weekday days and go to someplace that you can reach in ~2 hours by train like Titlis/Engelberg, Flims Laax, Lenzerheide, etc.  Means you do have to get up crazy early to get to the slopes early, though.
