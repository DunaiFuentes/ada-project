The same way the canton of Vaud refres to itself as the 'état de Vaud', this time in French ('état' translates to 'state').

There are plenty of examples of things named with 'staat' (all examples concerning Berne):
- Staatliche Komissionen
- Staatsschreiber
- Staatskanzlei

The same applies to Vaud, here the third sentence of its constitution:
'Le Canton de Vaud est l'un des Etats de la Confédération suisse'

For me the phrase 'Kanton Bern' and 'Staat Bern' or 'canton de Vaud' and 'état de Vaud' are synonymes. 'Staat/état' are used widely in other contexts, while 'Kanton' is used exclusively in the Swiss context. It may well be that not all Swiss cantons use Staat in this way, but Berne and the French speaking cantons certainly do.
