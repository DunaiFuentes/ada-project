History is very interesting providing that you are someone who has an ""open minded"" spirit and are willing to learn about things that don't always concern you directly. But a teacher will almost always be a deciding factor in the ways you handle and learn about anything really.

Bad/uninterested teacher = Less interest and less will for the students to be involved and learn. It is a very difficult job and things can go south really quickly.

When it came to slavery he said it was a dark chapter and he is not advocating segregation or even slavery at all.
