Great point, but a big difference is that the market for Euros is so large compared to the physical gold market, buying euros will therefore not affect price as much as in the case of gold. 

SNB could be a big winner btw, if Swiss people vote yes. If other central banks start buying after SNBs large purchases are finished (20% peg to the monetary base), the price may remain high. But I feel this will not happen for many reasons. Most central banks do not care about gold and I don't see any sign of this changeing in the coming years. So who will keep the price high after SNBs peg is reached? Who will take their place?

BE: Berner Platte has already been mentioned. Try to get Zungenwurst and sour turnips (""Sauerrüben"") with it. I don't care for sauerkraut, but I'd kill for sour turnips. The dried green beans are also pretty darn excellent, so insist on that.

There is plenty of good wine grown on the North Shore of Lake Bienne. Now is also the time when they cook saucisson in the alambic used to distill Marc (""Treberwurst/Saucisse au marc""). Highly recommended. Then head North towards Bellelay and get yourself some Tête de Moine.

Lake Thun produces some esoteric, but surprisingly good red wine if you can get your hands on a bottle. The whites are not terribly good IMO. As long as you're near the Highlands, it is mandatory that you try Hobelkäse.

VD: Sausage country. Saucisson vaudois, saucisse aux choux, boutefas and so on all need to be tested, preferrably accompanied by a Papet vaudois. In addition, Lakes Geneva and Neuchâtel produce plenty of fish to try. Perch fritters with Tatare sauce are always nice. L'Etivaz and Vacherin Mont d'Or cheeses are highly recommended, too.

As for wine, plenty of whites to choose from -- Lavaux if you like them dry and flinty, La Côte if you like them to be a bit more mellow, and Bonvillars if you want to go where nobody else goes. Not to forget Boxer beer in Yverdon.

GE: A nice Longeole suggests itself, as does Cardon Epineux. Entrecôte Café de Paris is another classic. Plenty of wine grown around the Canton, too.

VS: Raclette, tons of different dried little sausages from the German-speaking (?) part (Gommerli, Randenwurst etc.), dried meat. Plenty of wine to go around here, with quite a few excellent local varietals you won't find anywhere else in the world (Petite Arvine, Humagne Rouge, Cornalin, Lafnetscha just to name a few).

NE: Saucisson neuchâtelois, dry white wines and probably the best sparkling wines in Switzerland. Absinthe is legal again, too.

GL: Glarner Pastete is a hidden gem.

JU: Saucisse d'Ajoie, Damassine, microbrews from brasserie des Franches-Montagnes.

GR: Nusstorte, Pizzoccheri, Maluns, Capuns, barley soup. Molino di Poschiavo makes great old-fashioned pasta. Some very good red wines, too.
