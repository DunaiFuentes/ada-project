Next to marriage, being rich and student visa there is one more chance: An extraordinary or unique education. Switzerland tries to attract talents all over the world and we really have trouble finding the proper know how in the small, local population. That's why highly educated people from the US have absolutely no trouble finding a job and a visa here. I don't know your background, but that would be another venue to get here. Given your age, you probably don't have the high education required (yet). Unfortunately being an English speaker isn't quite so unique though.

true,[deleted],null,null,"Ok, I'll add my (biased) $0.02; I'd explore the east of Switzerland, so Grisons, Appenzell, St. Gallen etc. There are stunning hike trails in Appenzell, one I can absolutely suggest to anyone is to hike from Brülisau to Bollenwees (steep ascent, ca. 2.5hrs) and to Fählensee, the scenery is absolutely stunning there. Also there is many beautiful mountain passes to travel, my favorite route is to go to Disentis, over Lukmanier summit and St. Gotthard into Lucerne. I'm not too much into paragliding though from what I've heard there is numerous flying areas around the Alpstein mountains, at Kronberg or Schwägalp for example.

Edit: The Rigi thing I think is unrealistic, the ascent is quite long and there's hotels up top so there will certainly be quite a bunch of people there. For food, there's many good restaurants in Switzerland, I can think of two off the top of my head, for one the Restaurant Sein in Zurich, awesome atmosphere, great food if you're in for something new, or for something more ""traditional"" Facincani in St. Gallen is amazing, really nice people with great Italian cuisine, though the restaurant is small so you might have to reserve. For typical Swiss it has to be said that there's no typical Swiss food, as it is highly regional. In Appenzell for example, you can seldom go wrong with a Käsefladen, which is a pie made with Appenzell cheese, cream and onions (the one at Plattenbödeli on the trail to Bollenwees is outstanding).

true,GoEKniGhtofNi,lu,Luzern,"Hi there! What a nice idea! I'm sure you will have a great time. Get a swiss pass (tourist ticket) for the time of your stay. Almost all trains, busses, ships and cable cares are included.

As for your proposal on mount rigi, I would recommend you to go for a sunset proposal. During summer time, sunrise is very early (around 4:30 - 4:50). Sunset gives you more time to enjoy the view of the alps and find the perfect spot. As you worte yourself, mount rigi is quite popular with tourists, however, they tend to leave at the evening with the last cogwheel train down to Vitznau or Arth. 

So here an idea:

Starting point: Lucerne (which you should check out too)

Around 09:00, take the lake cruse ship to Vitznau (http://www.lakelucerne.ch/en/special-offers/detail/article/rigi-rundfahrt.html - just one way) 

Take the cogwheel train from Vitznau to Rigi Kulm (station on the top). Get off and walk to the very top, next to the antenna (you'll see it).
Enjoy the view of the alps. 

Walk down to Kaltbad. On the way you pass some restaurants, where you could have something to eat. You'll pass several benches to sit down. You could ask her then, if you feel the time is right. If not, go take a swim at the Spa at Kaltbad. (http://www.mineralbad-rigikaltbad.ch/index.asp?chglang=en&amp;kat=home). You could book a hotel room there too: http://www.hotelrigikaltbad.ch/index_e.php

With the hotel roome booked, you could go for a late night walk and ask her at nightfall or, if you feel the time is not right yet, get to bed and wake her up at 4:15 for the sunrise proposal ;-)

I hope this helps. Had to write this on my mobile.
