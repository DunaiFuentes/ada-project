How you spend your free time here is kinda dependent on your interests and your budget. Skiing is obviously a fantastic way to spend February. It can get pricey and if you are on a tight budget you may not get to go as often as possible. There are loads of indoor Kletterhallen, but outdoor options might be more limited. There are some outdoor bouldering walls where I work at Hönggerberg. If you are a student you can participate in climbing groups there ([link](http://portal.asvz.ethz.ch/sportangebot/bergsport/Seiten/Boulderanlage.aspx)). That's probably a nice way to meet people.

false,whitepalms85,null,null,"&gt; ever more concentration of economic activities in one place is not sustainable

It is. Economic concentration is much more sustainable. Not sure, where you got this idea from. E.g. proximity to your workplace reduces energy use. If everyone would be evenly spread out then we would need much more infrastructure. Cities are actually very economic.

I really don't understand what are you trying to say in the rest of your answer:

&gt; Think also about how capital based rents can work if there aren't ever more credits taken out in the system. 

Are you talking about how the return on capital would be if there were no debt? Why would there be no debt?

&gt; As there are not ever more ppl coming to Switzerland (as you mentioned), how would that work out?

I don't know, again, why would there be no debt and I'm pretty sure more people will come here (or are you trying to say that people don't come here if there is no debt? I don't get it)

&gt; I offered a long term outlook (50 years+) to change the rents to a system where you pay much, but nothing gets lost by hoping somebody in the future pays more for a house or shares

Nothing gets lost because nobody is hoping that some will pay for them?! Are you trying to say that people will save more?

&gt;  but somehow, magically, this money has the same purchasing power compared to energy.

That sounds indeed very magical, why would money have the same purchasing power as energy?

&gt; Which is getting scarce and Switzerland with its high energy infrastructure needs that desperately. 

So you're against immigration because we can't produce enough energy? Well we could just import it, or build new nuclear plants or put more solar panel on root tops. I mean this is kind of a legit concern from a pure Swiss economic point of view but nature really doesn't care about it. This energy would have to be produced somewhere anyway. If you're concerned about nature than you should be concerned about how this energy is produced and not where (if you don't care about nature then this is totally irrelevant).",0,1414541899,null,0,1414542113,0,clmp7xw,t3_2k6xzv,t1_clmp7xw,t1_clmm3vi,null,1426300168,1,false,Switzerland,t5_2qhp6,1

false,whitepalms85,null,null,"&gt;  I read somewhere that after Zürich got rid of ""Pauschalbesteuerung"", contrary to popular belief, tax income did not collapse.

Of course not, but like 2/3 of them moved away and close to no new ones came. Overall it's a net loss. People are just envy and like bashing rich people but it means less tax income and hence higher taxes (or less services) for everyone. Making the rich poor really doesn't make anyone richer here. Also it's not like these rich people are causing any problems. Again, it's mainly people hating them. Just seems pretty irrational to me.

&gt; You actually have to ask yourself if it is morally acceptable, for people with a lot of money to come live here and pay a fixed amount, so they get out of proportional taxes.

Well, you could also ask yourself how moral it is that just an ever smaller portion of people is paying taxes while the rest is profiting from it. The whole proportional taxes thing isn't very morally sound anyway. The most logic thing would be to say that everyone pay for what he/she causes. Then you could argue that this is unfair, because some people have more potential / had better chances and so on. So everyone pay the same percentage. Fair enough. But then why would the percentage be even higher for people that are already paying more than everyone else? That's just greed, honestly, how would you feel it that rule would apply to you (btw. I'm not rich)? Also people that are 'pauschalbesteuert' already paid taxes on their income, so why would they have to pay taxes twice?

&gt;  The biggest problem hear is the ""poverty scissor"" becoming more and more open.

What's the problem here? Nobody is getting poorer and we're already the richest country on the planet. So it's a problem that not everyone can be a billionaire? Sorry, but people that say that are just greedy and want get something without doing something for it. Honestly, if you're so concerned about being rich, just go to uni, study finance and become an investment banker or so. Uni is even (almost) for free here in Switzerland, it's not like you're from some poor town in Africa without access to education or so. Also Switzerland is one of the most equal societies, so again, this 'poverty scissor' is just left wing populism.",0,1414543342,null,0,1414543546,0,clmq0xl,t3_2kgkgk,t1_clmq0xl,t1_cll8r8o,null,1426299781,2,false,Switzerland,t5_2qhp6,2
false,P1r4nha,zh,Zürich,"To a certain extent that's true. Only does the initiative do the exact opposite of changing that. 

Proponents of the measure all live in their own houses with a big garden. The idea of Ecopop is to make this lifestyle possible for everyone in Switzerland, because living in the city is oh so horrible. 

The lifestyle they think of is only possible with less people, but has nothing to do with ecology or preserving the environment. It's only preserving their wasteful lifestyle which is indeed not sustainable once global population has reached 11 billions and the people in China and India want a great lifestyle with house, garden and organic food. 

But even if that's not enough, the initiative additionally takes away money from our efforts to try and make up for the exploitation with development assistance. 

If you want to improve the global situation you have to teach Swiss people to life more sustainable and to buy local and fair trade. Closing the borders for immigrants won't change a thing and wasting money giving out condoms even worsens the situation.
