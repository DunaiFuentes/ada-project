&gt;

&gt;__Delegative democracy__, alternatively known as *liquid democracy*, is a form of democratic control whereby voting power is vested in delegates, rather than representatives. This term is a generic description of either already existing or proposed popular control apparatuses.

Lucern is a very pretty town and great medieval wall walk.

Nearby, take the trams from Kriens to Mt. Pilatus, then take the cog train down the other side to Alpnachstad.

Take the lake boat from Thun to Spiez to Interlaken.

It's pricey, with two different private trains, but go up from Interlaken to Lauterbrunnen, then from there up one of two ways to Kleine Scheidegg (and down the other way).  From Kleine Scheidegg one more train takes you into the mountain under the Jungfraujoch... where you can trek around on the glacier and enjoy views to 3 countries.  Perhaps a once in a lifetime thing... but I've done it twice!  On the way up and down are numerous amazing pastural vilages with great shops and hiking trails criss cross the entire region.

Take the train to Meringen.  Nearby is the Reichenbach falls of Sherlock Holmes fame (hike up and/or incline).  Also is the amazing natural glacial cut of Aareschlucht Gorge - walkways along the river and the second most amazing train I've ever seen (next to the Jungfraujoch above!)

I've also been to see Roman Ruins, and ridden the Glacier Express and Goldenpass scenic trains.  I reserved the ""up front"" seats on the Goldenpass... what a treat!

Frankly, just riding the trains around on a pass and stopping in many of the towns and villages is great fun.
