1) (And most importantly) Rumours are imo not newsworthy! The media is supposed to tell us facts not rumours! I am sure, that even if they state that it's just a rumour, they still form public opinion and I think a large percentage of people who read that are now 100% sure that these people all are FCZ-Hooligans. For that reason they risk starting a witchhunt without having any significant proof. Now also Blick.ch seems to have indirectly quoted the comment above [Link](http://www.blick.ch/news/schweiz/zuerich/hooligans-kommunisten-wirrkoepfe-wer-sind-die-idioten-von-zuerich-id3348703.html)
At least Blick.ch seem to have found an additional source.   
Of course a witchhunt against Hooligans, which is a very obscure group and which has a very bad reputation anyway, is not that bad (It is also very easy since noone wants to defend hooligans. This is probably also the reason 20min published this report without any sort of factchecking). In other cases however this kind of ""journalism"" can lead to severe damaging of someones reputation. 

2) The author of this article has no way check if the source ot this rumour is in anyway trustworthy (no offense to whitepalms85 ;-)). It could possibly be that someone who has an interest in spreading this rumour wrote the comment above, trying to bash the accused group. (Which again is probably not true here, but could well happen in another case). Plus, if they absolutely have to report on rumours, I think it should come from someone who is an expertof the scene, or at least from someone who was personally present that night. I think it is a very slippery slope if news-outlets start quoting people who cannot be held accountable for their words in any way. Because then people can just say whatever they want about whoever they want in the media without having to bring up any kind of proof for their statement. 

3) 20min has no (at least no personal) way to check whether they actually quote the person correctly. As we now saw in the responses of whitepalms85 above, they **did not quote him correctly**. They did not contact him to check if they can use his words in the newsarticle or if they understood him correctly.

Sorry for the long rant, but these are the reasons i still stand behind my statement, that  I think that this is terrible journalism.
