Edit: Looked it up. It's 14 volumes, edited by Peter Keckeis, published 1985-1988 by Ex Libris, Zurich.

The dahu is a strange animal, half-goat, half-wolf, but its most striking particularity is that, having evolved to the Valais slopes, it's fore and hind legs on one side are a lot shorter than those on the other side, allowing him a better grip on the mountain.

The dahus came in two species: clockwise and anti-clockwise. However, this great animal is now extinct, mainly due to how easy it was to hunt it: shout ""dahu! dahu!"" behind it and it will turn around - and crash to the bottom of the slope.",0,1411711774,null,0,false,0,ckswgt6,t3_2hh1vn,t1_ckswgt6,t3_2hh1vn,null,1426817006,12,false,Switzerland,t5_2qhp6,12

By all means....continue to keep silent and look the other way.

&gt;it's just some stupid young guys getting excited by the fire and yelling ""fuck all you sons of bitches"",

Or....it might be a couple of young Islamic supremacists expressing their contempt for the infidel country in which they now live. The Swiss have a right to know what kind of people are inhabiting their country.
