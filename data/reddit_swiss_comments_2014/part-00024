true,anonlymouse,be,Bern,"Honestly, the friends we made is the only really good thing I can say about it, (and the salads at lunch). I got bullied by a first grader, who was still up to it when I visited Switzerland again a few years later, so nobody at the school had done anything about him, and both my kindergarten teacher and my brother's 4th grade teacher were pretty terrible. Some of the other teachers were certainly better, but with how you get the same teacher throughout all the grades (in the public school system it resets every 3 or 6 years, so that's a bit easier to survive if you get a bad one), if your kid gets a bad one you're going to want to pull them out and put them in the public system. 

Our friends had 4 kids that went to that school, the one that was my age was lucky as she was the teacher's pet, the one a year younger than us ended up getting pulled out as she had troubles too.

It's called ""going off on a tangent"" and we Swiss are masters at it. Especially in conversation with a foreigner, this character flaw is taken to new limits.

I think it's best to think off a Swiss person as a really pious priest who will lecture you at length about the ""way things are done here"" whenever he or she has the opportunity. 

So in your case, your first mistake was answering the question of why you moved here. You should never answer this question since this is nothing more than a trap question, no matter what you answer, there is guaranteed a Swiss to will use this opportunity to dump his general unhappiness with his life in form of a rant upon you.

Now notice how /u/raskalnikow answered your question. He went off on a tangent and opened a huge can of worms, namely that Switzerland doesn't know separation from class and ideology, and this only now changing due to, OH SHOCK WHAT A SURPRISE, foreigners moving to Switzerland.

Firstly from a historical perspective, this is simply wrong. Switzerland was a conglomerate of patrician republics where the urbanized elite dominated the vast rural populations.

Secondly, from an educational perspective, Switzerland's system with its early split between the Realschule and the Sekundarschule (and gymnasium) is exactly that, a class separator. I don't know too many countries where at the age of 12 it is decided whether you'll end up becoming a hairdresser or a doctor. Needless to say that children with immigration backgrounds or coming from poverty usually end up being sent to the Realschule. 

Thirdly, as a Swiss, his answer is especially funny because compared to other countries, there are actually quite a lot of Rudolf-Steiner schools here in Switzerland, or other alternatives such as the Montessori system. Almost everyone knows somebody who went to a Rudolf-Steiner school.
