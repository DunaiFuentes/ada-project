My advice (as a grad student) is to consider not only the quality of the programs in your field at various institutions, funding and costs, etc, but also where you want to live and work post-grad.

You are paying 69 chf for a 20 Mb download /2 Mb upload connection with Swisscom !!!! it's nearly a robbery

For example, with upc cablecom for 55 CHF you have a 35/3.5.( for 65 CHf a 75/7 , for 79 chf a 150\ 10 connection).

Any way, take a look at comparis.ch  (search for internet providers)

This site is for compare prices and services. You can check all the ISP company, maybe in BERN you can find better one than upc cablecom.

true,_Ganjalf,null,null,"With a Swiss passport you can travel all around Europe without needing a VISA. For working around Europe it's not that easy, you still need a special VISA, like I'm Swiss but for work in Italy, for ex, I need to have a particular permit. (Switzerland is not part of EU).

The majority of  schools are in the German and French side of the Country so you need the know the language too. (some university due English classes too, not everyone). 

School are cheaper compare to US but the cost of living is really high, not easy to find part-time jobs too, especially if you don't know the language.

Be careful, because a lot of Swiss school have problem to be recognized in Europe, so inform yourself very well.
ex: My Uni bachelor it's not always recognized in all European Country.
