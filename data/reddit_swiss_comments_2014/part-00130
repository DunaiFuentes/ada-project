true,Wodashit,cern,ATLAS,"Mhhh, so if I understood correctly what you said you are able to run your script but don't know how to add the correct information in the header to have access to the TGraph and TCanvas classes?

If this is the case you just have to put

    #include&lt;TCanvas.h&gt;
    #include&lt;TGraph.h&gt;

Doing so would give you access to those two classes.

Does that answer your question?

By the way your script is in C++, Emacs is just the name of an editor and I guess it's because people have shown you how to connect yourself to lxplus and run root from there.",0,1399495694,null,0,false,0,chc55e0,t3_24zc9p,t1_chc55e0,t3_24zc9p,null,1433695628,2,false,CERN,t5_2r692,2
true,tangerinelion,null,null,"CINT is horrible and I wish it would die.  Until then, you have two ways of running C++ code in ROOT (and even then, certain parts of standard C++ do not work - pointers to member fields do not work yet pointers to member functions do.  Virtual inheritance is largely broken but only if you override a function.).

First is if your script looks like this:

    {
         double x[10];
         double y[10];
         TGraph* myGraph = new TGraph();
         // etc.
    }

versus

    void myFunction() {
         double x[10]; double y[10]; // etc....
    }

then you indeed have a script.  Or what some folks like to, mistakenly, call a ""macro."" (See below).

With a script you would launch ROOT and run it as such:

     .x myScript.C

and it does some stuff and whatever variables you declared in the script are now accessible names.  It's as if you had typed each line in one-by-one into the ROOT console.

With the latter you'd execute it as such, preferably compiling it:

    .L myCode.C+
    myFunction()

If you do this then you need to include the headers for whatever classes you use; as you've already been told.  You do not do this for the script style of writing.

**Protip** For most cases your data is coming from some sort of ROOT file with a TTree inside.  If this is the case then you should try as much as possible to take advantage of the TTree::Draw function.  Suppose you have a TTree with a bunch of entries of (x,y) positions and then some associated event data.  If you want a plot of (x,y) points you can do this:

     myTree-&gt;Draw(""x:y""); // Note the use of the colon

If you wanted the (x,y) positions only in the case that some other variable, z &gt; 1, then you can do this:

     myTree-&gt;Draw(""x:y"",""z &gt; 1."");

And lastly, if you wanted to plot the average value of y as a function of x in the case that z &gt; 1, then you can do this:

    myTree-&gt;Draw(""x:y"",""z&gt;1."",""PROF""); // Creates a TProfile 

These are all helpful things to do before you go ahead and write some sort of script.

**Second Protip** If your data isn't in a TTree format but instead in some stupid text file, convert it to a TTree.  If you had this data:

    x      y     z
    2.0   3.0   4.0
    // etc.

Then you would want to read it in line by line, create an event for each line and write out a TTree.

    TFile* f = new TFile(""output.root"",""RECREATE"");
    TTree* t = new TTree(""myTree"");
    Double_t x,y,z;
    t-&gt;Branch(""x"",&amp;x);t-&gt;Branch(""z"",&amp;y);t-&gt;Branch(""z"",&amp;z);
    std::ifstream infile(""data.dat"");
    while(infile &gt;&gt; x &gt;&gt; y &gt;&gt; z) {
       t-&gt;Fill();
    }
    t-&gt;Write();
    delete t;
    delete f; // Closes file - lots of people seem to not understand TFile::~TFile() first calls TFile::Close().

---------------------------------------------------------

In C, the word ""macro"" is well defined.  It has been defined since the 1970s and well before ROOT was even conceived.  Here is a macro:

    #define max(x,y) ((x) &gt; (y) ? (x) : (y))
