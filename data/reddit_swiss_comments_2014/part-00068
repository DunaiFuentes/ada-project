true,SoulLink,null,null,"&gt; TLDR: How/when/where should I buy train tickets for traveling around Switzerland?

Where ever and whenever you feel like it. No reservations needed, our trains aren't as full as any news suggest and when the train is full it isn't possible to reserve anyway. 

Tickets can be bought online, with your phone, at the station and in the train (but they don't like that so much).

There are plenty of nice restaurants along the lake side. There is a nice bike path all the way around (you can rent bikes from SBB). Taking a boat ride to Friedrichshafen is nice, too.

Not sure about nice restaurants in the Alpstein. There is quite a traditional place called ""Schnuggebock"" near Teufen, it's pretty nice as far as I remember.

true,unicornsworshipme,zh,Zürich,"Let's talk about Schwingen.

The Schwingfeste usually take place in summer. The best thing to do is to visit a Bergschwinget, meaning attending a match that is held in the mountains. So don't bother visiting a city to do that...

Since Schwingen became very popular in the last few year it might be difficult to get tickets. E.g. seats at Brünig, Stoos and Schwägalp seem to be sold out. You might still get some tickets at the day of the match (esp. when you are okay with standing rooms). Alternatively try the matches on [Rigi](http://www.rigi-schwingen.ch/), [Schwarzsee](http://www.schwarzseeschwinget.ch) or [Weissenstein](http://www.weissenstein-schwinget.ch/)

Note that it says Schwing**feste**. Of course there are the fights, but there you'll witness lots of folklore and culture. The Feste usually start early with mass, than there will be music, maybe an Alpaufzug, the matches and lots of beer and Schnaps. So you should invest the whole sunday for a Schwingfest.

Schwingfeste are easy-going. You'll meet lots of rural people, not everyone will speak English. Don't feel intimidated though: People attending Schwingfeste see themselves as a big family where everyone is friendly and open to anybody else.
