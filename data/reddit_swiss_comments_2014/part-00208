true,ltouroumov,vd,Echallens,"&gt; 1) How do you fit your paper money in your wallet? The bills are too fat for my wallet.

As a swiss I have the opposite problem: Too many damn coins. I usually pay with bills then I remember I have like CHF30 in 5/2/1/.50 coins that weigh a ton.

&gt; 4) Am I the only one being fooled by doors? It is difficult to tell whether a door is push or pull, making myself look stupid on a lot of occasions.

Sometimes I have to try 3 times pull/push/pull harder. Damn four dimensional doors. That aside in french: Tirer -&gt; Pull / Pousser -&gt; push

&gt; 5) Everyone speaks different languages, yet people still find a way to communicate effectively. It is awesome.

I feel pain for the people who have to translate every single official text in three languages. Meaning we have three versions of our law each with its own subtle variations.

&gt; 6) The whether is bi-polar. One second it is sunny, the next second it is humid, thundering, and pouring rain.

Mountains + Clouds = Microclimate heaven.

&gt; 8) Do Swiss people normally drink from the faucet? I'm guessing the water is much cleaner here than in the USA, but it is still odd for me.

The Evian bottled water is just tap water from the city of Evian. Depends on where you are there could be lots of minerals in the water that leaves a white coating or rim on a gless as it dries.

&gt; 9) Water from the faucet gets extremely hot/cold very fast. I love it.

Water pressure tends to be higher than in other countries. When I went to the UK, the water pressure in the shower was so disappointing (they also didn't have the [mixing lever](http://www.bellabathrooms.co.uk/media/catalog/product/cache/1/image/9df78eab33525d08d6e5fb8d27136e95/e/o/eon-single-lever-mono-basin-mixer-tap-pf305_6.jpg) on the tap)

&gt; 10) Everything is expensive.

That's what you get in a country with a GDP per capita of [$81'000](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_GDP_%28nominal%29_per_capita).


&gt; 11) People do not seem to like eye contact here. Am I just creepy?

Swiss are shy I guess. Though it depends on where you are, I hear they are more friendly on the east of the [röstigraben](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R%C3%B6stigraben). Just a different definition of personal space.

&gt; 13) I've asked for water at restaurants, but had to pay 5 CHF+ for a bottle when I simply wanted tap water. Oh god. I also bought a giant pack of sparkling water on accident. Bullshit!

Sometimes it's cheaper to drink [Rivella](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rivella) (allergy warning: milk based) or [thé froid / ice tea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nestea) (which translates to ""cold tea"").

&gt; 14) Everyone here is so damn gorgeous. I have yet to see a fat person, and it makes me sad.

80kg (~180lbs) for 175cm (average height, ~5ft9) is overweight around here so standards may differ from country to country. And apparently we have a big problem with obesity.

Also maybe, healthy food culture. We don't tend to use corn syrup for soft drinks. There are LOTS of regulations around food with what they can contains in terms of sugar/salt/etc ...

true,pagkatapos,vd,Vaud,"The security is insanely lax. I usually bring in a bottle of water to fill up during the day. Then I buy beer at some sports club, just because they're happy for any monetary support. If you can't be bothered, buy a whole glas of wine so you can chill out longer without going back for new beer.

When I go in I pick up a map from the info center along with some ear plugs. Then I invariably get a free portable ash tray from one of those eco stands at the back 'cause this is a green festival and love thy earth (and the voluntary cleaners!), etc., etc.,

The crowd is varied (all kids under 12 are free!) and if you want to be physical I'd suggest you go way to the front, in the middle people are chill and have their personal space already. If you're lazy right next to the handicap places are usually good to chill out, they've got the best views while sitting and enjoying that wine. And if you're elderly or have two kids under the age of 10 there's the tribunes for you to sit on.

My fave things to eat are the churros and the amazing cheese naan. Then I usually end up drinking a half a litre milkshake because the milk bar is a convenient place to regroup and while waiting for some lost friends it suddenly seems like a good idea... trust me, it isn't.

Basically there's a lot for you to do, but if you don't want to do it, Paléo's a pretty lovely place to do nothing. (And seconding the la Ruche comment.)",0,1405981562,null,0,false,0,cj3uowu,t3_2bak8x,t1_cj3uowu,t3_2bak8x,null,1434828694,3,false,Switzerland,t5_2qhp6,3
