true,chromopila,zh,Zürich,"I don't feel like doing anybody's homework, but I can see how finding ressources about Swiss German can be hard, so here it goes:


First off: It might help you that a friend of mine which emigrated to Sweden thinks that the difference between Swedish and Norwegian is similar as the difference between Swiss German and High German(whatever that means)

&gt;  i need to know some of your most used slangs

According to my sister the expression I use most is

Steil gah = steil gehen = lit.: To go steep fig.: to get drunk or to go partying


&gt; maybe things that are stereotypical but correct

Germans make fun of us saying we end our sentences with ""oder?"", and many Swiss really do. ""Oder"" acts as a placeholder for ""oder etwa nicht?"" which means pretty much the same as the English ""isn't it?"".

&gt; a joke or 2 that only swiss people know

I don't know how good your German is, and even it would be 10/10 it wouldn't probably help too much, but when it comes to ""fun with words in Swiss German"" you should check out Mani Matter(the inventor of Punk music *and* Hip Hop), unfortunately he died 40 years ago. A little more modern are Swiss hip hop artists. My favourites are Sektion Chuchichästli they're really worth  a listen. Unless you don't want to listen to the same laid back beat for a whole album.

&gt; maybe you could explain something that people think of you that isnt true at all,as a swiss of course

That the Swiss dialect is a primitive abomination of High German. Yes we have next to no tenses(why bother about grammatical times when we have our awesome watches), the case structure is next to non-existent and our way of pronouncing words might make the average German think that we survived an abortion. But guess what: simplification is a sign of intelligence, and we have the most beautiful vocabulary of all languages ever. Seriously, what other language has words like ""gagele"" for rocking a chair, or ""göötsche"" for playing with water?

&gt; and how to speak like a true swiss,and not just a german who uses swiss slang.

Use Swiss grammar, Swiss vocabulary, learn some new vowels. I only met two Germans which I didn't immediately recognise as Germans. One is from East Prussia, the other from Mähren, go figure...

I would agree, but a German who I recently had a drink with described our language much more flattering.
