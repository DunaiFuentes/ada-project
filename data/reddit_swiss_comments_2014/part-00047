I'm not that sure if I count as well educated though-in retrospective I would have probably voted no. It was probably the thoughest political decision I ever made-I'm only 18 though and disn't have to vote on EU-Beitritt or Schengen...


/u/086 brought up some arguments already, these are pretty much the ones I based my decision on. I was and still am worried about so many people coming to Switzerland, but it's more because of overpopulation and less because of ""loss of cultural identity"" (or whatever you call that).

 I also think that ""shoveling"" people out of second/third world countries into first world countries is not the ideal long-term-solution. I work as a cashier part-time and have a lot of customers who speak very little, if any, german. As far as I know, many of these people stay in their groups (many germans have mostly german friends). In my opinion ""multicultural society"" shouldn't mean ""we have lots of different mini-societies"". I admit there's probably a better solution to that problem than sinply reducing the number of people coming to Switzerland.

And yes, I'm surprised by the EUs reaction. Seems like a child that had his toy taken away to me... According to the article, the EU announced this. Why have I never heard about that before the vote? I'm no SVP-supporter, I think their way of convincing people is often disgusting. It's just that the SVP had numbers on their side that seemed pretty convincing to me, while the opponents mainly argued along the lines ""the SVP is a bunch of xenophobes who will ruin our economy"". Never having lived in a time where swiss economy was not thriving, I found that pretty hard to grasp. Also, from the last big votes, the opponents should have learned that SVP-bashing is not going to work. I think too many people are comfortable with the feeling that we're all rational grown-ups who won't support such a stupid idea and then they don't vote-I'd bet pretty high that most of the people who didn't vote would have written no on that piece of paper. Yes, politics should not be based on fear-that's why the opponents have to do a better job at explaining their arguments and bringing them all to the table.

I agree. The interview was just that. But I also found it revealing, because it sounded really different than what we heard from the SVP before the vote.

&gt; What do you mean by that?

Personally I don't think we should renegotiate the free migration agreement, but I can respect that some people want to do that. The question is, how if not with a vote like this?

&gt; I'm sorry to hear that. But let's be honest, that's not because of the contract, that's because of the hurt ego involved. Examples of hurt egos are easily found in the comment sections of the newspapers and/or some newspaper articles...

Yeah, I agree. It's too early to draw consequences for both sides, but with Croatia entering Schengen and us not going to sign the free immigration agreement with them, real consequences will arise soon.

Then when you read that the Europe threatened the Switzerland if we voted yes, I don't like threat that's not how it works, I spend a long time looking for why I should vote no, and the mainly reason was the Europe will not appreciate it, that's not how you convince someone to vote for you.

On your overpopulation argument: Yes, we have a relatively high population density, but we have almost no negative consequences of that. Our infrastructure is really, really good and we have the money and the plans to improve it even further. The environmental aspect of our immigration is negligible at this point in my opinion.

More interesting is the argument of the enclaves or a ""ghettofication"" of immigrants who don't speak the language and otherwise don't integrate. I see this as the only real danger we're facing at the moment. Switzerland pressures foreigners to integrate/assimilate a lot, but doesn't offer a lot of help to do that on a private level (Swiss mentality is rather cautious and reluctant), but also on an institutional level.

I'm actually surprised we don't have more problems given that we don't do a lot in this regard for our foreigners. Other than just forcing them to understand us. I agree however that we shouldn't create mini-societies when trying to achieve multiculturalism.

Information flow during the campaigning was weird. I agree with that. The media seems to focus a lot more on the vote now that it's over compared to before the vote, which is of course useless, but not surprising given the result.

&gt; Since it became associated with EU research framework programmes in 2004, Switzerland has derived a positive net
financial return from the FPs. In other words, the amount of FP project funding secured by Swiss researchers exceeds
the financial contribution that the Confederation has paid the EU: with FP6 (2003–2006), for instance, Switzerland
paid the EU a total of CHF 775.3 million whereas Swiss researchers secured a total of CHF 794.5 million from the EU.
This corresponds to a net financial return of CHF 19.2 million. With the current FP7, Swiss researchers have secured a
total commitment of CHF 1.56 billion from the EU (as of the cut-off date). This is already double the amount secured
under FP6, and FP7 is not yet finished.
There are two reasons why it is currently not possible to estimate the absolute financial return from Swiss participation
in FP7. First of all, FP projects tend to run over a period of several years. It will take about two years after the
end of FP7 to know the full amount of committed project funding. Secondly, Switzerland's effective contributions
to FP7 will only be calculated after the official close of FP7. The net financial result from FP7 will therefore only be
known in 2016.

Sicher. 

&gt; Seit der Assoziierung im Jahr 2004 verzeichnet die Schweiz einen positiven finanziellen Rückfluss aus den FRPs. Dies
bedeutet, dass im Rahmen der Beteiligungen an den vollständig abgeschlossenen FRPs eine höhere Summe in Form
von Projektfördermitteln in die Schweiz geflossen ist, als der Bund in Form von Pflichtbeiträgen an die EU bezahlt hat:
So standen in den 6. FRPs (2003–2006) den Schweizer Pflichtbeiträgen von 775,3 Millionen Franken Fördermittel von
794,5 Millionen Franken gegenüber, die Schweizer Forschenden gewährt wurden. Dies entspricht einem Nettozufluss
an Forschungsmitteln von 19,2 Millionen Franken. In den zurzeit laufenden 7. FRPs konnten Schweizer Forschende bis
zum Stichdatum europäische Fördermittel im Umfang von insgesamt 1559 Millionen Franken verpflichten. Dies entspricht
bereits vor Ende der 7. FRPs einer Verdoppelung der in den 6. FRPs erhaltenen Fördermittel.
Der absolute Rückfluss aus dem 7. FRP kann derzeit nicht geschätzt werden, und zwar aus zwei Gründen: Erstens
dauern FRP-Projekte typischerweise mehrere Jahre, womit die verpflichteten Projektfördermittel erst ca. zwei Jahre
nach dem Ende des 7. FRP vorliegen werden. Zweitens stehen auch die effektiven Aufwendungen der Schweiz für
die Beiträge ans 7. FRP erst einige Zeit nach dem offiziellen Abschluss fest. Somit kann der finanzielle Rückfluss für

Switzerland was getting from FP7 far more than it was giving. According to [this interim report from the confédération, section 4.6.2:](http://www.sbfi.admin.ch/themen/01370/01683/index.html?lang=en&amp;download=NHzLpZeg7t,lnp6I0NTU042l2Z6ln1ad1IZn4Z2qZpnO2Yuq2Z6gpJCEdH93hGym162epYbg2c_JjKbNoKSn6A--)

&gt;&gt; Turning our attention to current data available for FP7, we find that the proportion of FP7 funding secured by Swiss
researchers stands at 4.25% (i.e. CHF 1.56 billion out of a total of CHF 36.67 billion in FP7 funding awarded thus
far). Switzerland's contribution to FP7, based on data from 2007 to June 2012, is currently estimated at 2.8% of
the total FP7 budget. Switzerland's financial return coefficient for FP7 therefore currently stands at 1.52 (i.e.
4.25% divided by 2.80%).

so if it were confirmed that we are not involved in H2020 as we were in FP7, it will be a loss of several hundreds millions CHF for Swiss research.

Now, this is a petty and stupid move from the EC. Scientific collaboration should not be used as a bullying tool. Beside, regarding ""modern sciences"", the EU gets far more from Switzerland than the other way around.

First, you can work in Switzerland as much as any citizen from outside the Schengen zone. Given the number of foreigners who came to Switzerland before the Schengen agreement, it is clear that it is not so difficult. Second, there is not a ""mentality"" here. The ones for Switzerland staying in the EU framework programs are not the ones who voted ""yes"" in the recent votation.

Personally, putting aside the current crisis, I would prefer a system where each country gets back the money it puts, with a scientific evaluation at the EU level so that it breaks local academic political games and facilitate scientific collaboration. This was the situation for Switzerland in FP6, and for Israel in FP7, and it works fine.

If you put in common ""all the money"", by definition you are going to give even ""more money to the rich"", who will attract top-researchers, and the system will go on increasing the contrasts, emptying the poorest countries from all their good academics.
