- Cervelat. Mustard: See above. 

- Eat the above with a healthy dose of fresh bread from a local bakery (you'll find many as long as you aren't in Zurich - Zurich is sort of a bakery wasteland). Ask for 'Ruchbrot' to get something typically Swiss that's absolutely delicious. 

- You'll find free to use grill places everywhere - there's probably an official map for that somewhere. Hint: Bratwurst *must* be grilled, Cervelat *can* be grilled (or cooked or eaten raw). 

- For when it's not Wurst, have canned Ravioli, preferably from Migros. Because tradition. Add generous amounts of pepper, but no salt. 

- When you cook inside, at least once you'll have to prepare [Älplermagronen](http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%84lplermagronen).
