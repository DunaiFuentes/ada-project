The swiss franc is currently fixed to the euro (meaning the national bank of Switzerland will keep buying euros to keep a stable exchange rate). And the euro is fixed to the US dollar. 
Soo since the dollar is about to crash it will pull the euro down with it. And therefore also the swiss franc.

But if our money is not just fiat money but backed with something real like gold, the whole forthcoming economy crash will have much less impact on Switzerland.

Will the national bank of Switzerland have less options to juggle the numbers? Of course because you can't work (gamble) with gold sitting in a safe. Is that a huge problem? Well the ""experts"" tell us it would harm the economy. 

But I don't care about the economy, I care about the people. Looking back in history it's the times that the people suffer the most when the economy thrives. So maybe we should care more about the people and sustainability than for the economy.
