I have [such a plan with UPC-Cablecom](http://www.upc-cablecom.ch/en/internet/products/internet-150/) in the canton de Vaud. After three months of usage, my stats say that I have a median download speed of 142Mbs and a median upload of 9.1Mbs. My latency is ~10ms. So yeah, you can have that.

This was obtained with a speedtest web site which uses as a reference server a server from my ""line provider"" (who is not UPC cablecom). So these stats are the best I can achieve. To test in more realistic situation, I downloaded once a ubuntu DVD at an average speed of 112Mbs with bittorrent.

On saturday evenings the bandwidth can get a bit worse, and it often drops to ~70Mbs.

I also have a server running 24/24 with a dynamic DNS and several check of other servers every hours or so, and I am notified by mail as soon as the connection comes back if there is a problem, and there is none.

Edit: [Here are the graphs, because I am a nerd.](http://imgur.com/a/3CsJW#0)

Edit2: The strange shape of the latency curve is due to the fact that the speedtest web site uses two servers for the test, and pick 90% one which gives a latency of ~15ms, upload ~9.5Mbs and download ~155Mbs, and 10% another one, with a latency of ~10ms upload of ~10.5Mbs and download ~140Mbs. I guess that my ""real"" max upload speed is ~10.5Mbs and download ~165Mbs.

You can become a teacher here in a regular school if your German is good enough, Swiss German is absolutely not needed, but obviously very advantageous.

But I understand what you mean, and it's not even the first time that I've had this type of misunderstanding. It's quite sad, really, how people assume that I'm uneducated just because I make different choices than them. I have great faith in the scientific method. People are usually surprised that I vaccinate my children, give them fluoridated toothpaste and have never given them any homeopathic ""treatment"". I say wanting my children to grow up surrounded by trees instead of iPads, and wanting them to start reading at 7 instead of 4, doesn't make me ignorant, just maybe non-average. But people are always afraid of ""different"" and it's easier to face those fears if you can use blanket terms for all kinds of different and label them as ""crazy"".

We like this school because we want our children to go to a Waldorf school. There are four Waldorf (Steiner) schools in Zurich.

As to why we want a Waldorf school, the answer could fill a book!

true,giggles91,vs,Valais,"I don't know about having to speak the local language. When I was in high school we had french teachers who hardly spoke any German because they were from the french part of Switzerland, and this was in a German speaking school. I can imagine that you could get a job as an English teacher even if you're German wasn't very good, but only for advanced classes, say the last two years of high school, because they have enough basics to follow the lessons completely in English. I think the bigger problem for you would be to show that you have all the diplomas to become a teacher here, because university is not enough to become a teacher in Switzerland AFAIK, people have to complete a year at the ""Pädagogische Hochschule"" after their university degree to become a high school teacher usually.
