Gruyeres is very cute storybook village and it's maybe 40 min by car or an hour by train from Lausanne.  There is a cheese factory and a chocolate factory nearby and the Geiger museum as well as a cute castle.
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gruy%C3%A8res

Chateau Chillon http://www.chillon.ch/en/index.cfm is near Montreux and a close train ride away.  While you are there take a stroll through Montreux as it's the epitome of the ""swiss riviera"" Also the train ride from Lausanne to Montreux is lovely as you will pass through the vineyards and have an exquisite view of the lake.

Ouchy http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ouchy is the waterfront area of Lausanne and can be reached by the metro.

http://www.lausanne.ch/mhl the Lausanne history museum is nice.  There is a model of the city from 1638 in the basement and you can watch the audio-visual presentation in English.  It's near the cathedral and the views of the city are nice from there.

One of the closest places to get up into the mountains from Lausanne is http://www.leysin.ch/en/index.cfm  there is a nice rotating restaurant there.

I would probably avoid Geneva as I personally don't find it that interesting.  It's really a matter of taste.  Do you prefer outdoor activities, seeing the mountains/glaciers, etc... Or are you more of a history person?  Maybe food is your thing?

As you are young, the Flon area is where most of the nightlife is concentrated.  There is a lot of nightlife there as it is a college town. One of the biggest nightclubs in Switzerland is http://www.madclub.ch/
