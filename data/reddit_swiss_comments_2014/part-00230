true,Motzlord,tg,Thurgau,"&gt;What is the best way to go about looking and applying for a full time job?

Look for adverts online and in newspapers. Problem is though, for most jobs you'd need to speak German (Or French/Italian, depending on the region). If you're just looking for *any job* then it would greatly benefit you if you knew German (and/or Swiss German). If that's not an option right now (although it is a must if you really wanna move here), look for positions in your field of expertise. You might also wanna do a Master's degree here. :)

&gt;I have read through other posts related to this topic and understand that EU citizenship is a big help with regards to gaining the right to work and live in Switzerland.

Yes. Basically you can just waltz in and apply for a ""looking for work"" visum which should be valid for 6 months and you should usually get it without any trouble.


&gt;I am also aware that the cost of living in Switzerland is ~20% higher than where I am living at the moment.

Yes, but so are the wages. Shit is expensive, but you're also paid well. Just to throw a number out there: A cashier earns about 25 CHF per hour. But, your point gains significant relevance if you don't have a job. Try to find a job as soon as possible. Staying here without a job will be very expensive and eat through your reserves extremely quickly. Already your compulsory health insurance will cost you at least around 220 CHF a month. It would help if you had connections and could stay at someones place. :)

Also, be aware that it's not easy to 'survive without job' as foreigner here. Either make sure that you have a big enough bank account to handle 6 months without income or, which is always better but also more difficult, try to find a job before you move over.

Even if you're willing to settle for the cheapest everywhere, you'll need at the very least 2000CHF/month.
