&gt;Try building a Catholic church in Saudi Arabia, they would cut your head off

Try voting in Saudi Arabia and you won't be allowed to. Does that mean we shouldn't give Muslims the right to vote? Saudi Arabia is a theocracy, we shouldn't take example on them.

The biggest Muslim country in the world, Indonesia, allows the building of churches.

&gt;We are too liberal and tolerant.

LOL we are the most conservative country in Western Europe. Societal progress like women's votes or gay marriage arrive here decades after other developed countries have got them. And that's not even talking about the rampant xenophobia, the places (in your canton) where the town votes to see if you can be considered swiss and if your name ends with -ic or you are Muslim you can forget it, or the Minaret ban.

And so should you. I don't want to stereotype, but I'm hardly surprised it's a person from the Waldstätten making these comments. That or Appenzell...

I don't want to debate or reiterate the Minaret ban. I just want to tell you my experience during the discussions of the ban:

A lot of my friends knew from the beginning that they want to vote ""No"", and they also did. After the ""Yes"" was voted on the Minaret ban they had this wonderful idea. (I don't know where they got this idea from. Someone must have farted it into their brains). All of them found it a super duper idea. They saw something wrong with our voting system and the fix seemed obvious. The ""Yes"" was voted because (so  thought my friends) a lot of people assumed ""Minarett = Muezzin"" and the Muezzin will cry out 5 times a day. My friends wanted to include some form of knowledge questions to votes. For example: You can vote ""Yes"" or ""No"", and next to the vote are 2-3 simple questions like ""Do you know that BlaBla"" or ""Did you know that actually BlaBla"". The system would be super, because then only ""votes which got the answers right should be counted, all other votes should not be counted"".

I just wanted to tell you this story to show you that the ""obviously right decision"" (like a ""No"" to the Minarett ban) should not necessarily be enforcable somehow, because the consequences might be too grave. A ""bad thing"" like the Yes to the Minarett ban should be accepted as a necessity to all the good stuff we have: the directest democracy, the division of powers and concordance systems we have in place here in Switzerland.",0,1417601306,null,0,false,0,cmjsl55,t3_2o3a32,t1_cmjsl55,t1_cmjs216,null,1425705531,2,false,Switzerland,t5_2qhp6,2

&gt; LOL we are the most conservative country in Western Europe. Societal progress like women's votes or gay marriage arrive here decades after other developed countries have got them. And that's not even talking about the rampant xenophobia, the places (in your canton) where the town votes to see if you can be considered swiss and if your name ends with -ic or you are Muslim you can forget it, or the Minaret ban.

I don't think Switzerland is worse/more conservative/more xenophobic than the other western-european countries. I think the German proverb *The grass is always greener on the neighbours lawn* fits quite well here. Womens vote arrived very late because our democratic system is very slow and Switzerland lacks a lot of the historic context other countries who introduced it earlier had and which affected the emancipation (impact of world wars, basic political system, et al.). Gay marriage might not be legal yet, but from my experience the Swiss are tolerant towards homosexuality and homosexuals have almost equal rights  especially since the [registered partnership](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Registered_partnership_in_Switzerland) is allowed (they still don't have some of the rights a hetero couple would have, but I hope they'll get them as soon as possible).

&gt;the places (in your canton) where the town votes to see if you can be considered swiss and if your name ends with -ic or you are Muslim you can forget it

That's just as much generalisation as saying all muslims are violent.

One thing I also disagree with is this sentence:

&gt;I'd wager it'll be majority non-religious by the end of this century, like everywhere else in Western Europe

Considering there's still quite a lot of religiosity in western Europe I think it will only partially be non-religious, religion even has potential to increase again (e.g. in times of crises, humans tend to seek religion in troubled times).

Steg is one of the best places to buy Computer parts  (always check toppreise.ch any way, because some parts are cheaper in other stores)

Be careful over 62CHF you start to pay a lot of taxes trough mail    (like  12 chf + 10 + 8% of the merchandise price)... like for a 140 Euro (small package) I had to pay 50 chf of export duty, f insane!!!!

A lot of those company misleading costumers by putting ch on their address and most of the time they are from Europe = you will get screwed if you purchase over 62 chf.

Another solution is to use indabox.it  ( not too big packages)
Praticamente fai spedire il pacco presso un loro centro ritiro (di solito un bar) e tu vai fisicamente a ritirare il pacco presso questo posto in italia.
Paghi solo 3 euro per ritiro e non devi pagare le sovratassse della dogana. Stai solo attento a non superare i massimi legati alla dogana fisica che devi passare che, mi sembra, sono attorno ai 200 chf .

Ho usato questo servizio una decina di volta e funziona bene, non puoi farti spedire pacchi troppo grandi, ma é un servizio utile; specialmente perché eviti i prezzi assurdi dello sdoganamento via posta
