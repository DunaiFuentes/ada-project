A friend of mine has a 5s with sunrise. I have swisscom. My connection is sometimes better, but this usually isn't somewhere you are often, like in the woods or somewhere on the countryside.
One of the biggest advantages in his and my opinion is the phone insurance for I think 12.- CHF per month and 50.- to replace it, but you can replace it with any damage. In example, with his 4s the screen got broken, so he held it underwater had a complete broken phone and got it replaced. He had like 3 to 4 4s in his 2 year subscription, his 5s, ironically, didn't break so far.

**Home internet:**
My buddy also has the sunrise home internet. It works well so far, but I have the better speed with my swisscom. Also the Swisscom TV is much better than the sunrise equivalent. For home &amp; landline I advise you to use swisscom. We had problems with our swisscom internet once and after sending us a new modem, which didn't change anything, they sended an electic who replaced the cables in the house, so no mistake by swisscom.

true,unholy-web-worker,null,null,"Software developer from Austria working in Switzerland here. Can't give general answers but can share my experiences:

* I have never experienced any form of discrimination - a colleague from Germany claims otherwise though.

* There is an open job market but it is highly competitive. Companies will take their time to make a hiring decision and if they think that there is no 100% match than they'd rather leave the position vacant. Be prepared to spend quite a while searching a job.

* Conditions are you have to have a) a signed contract of employment and b) a place to live, to get a residence permit. This will change soon I think (they canceled the free movement contracts with the EU). Getting a flat in Zurich was as hard for me as finding a job, be aware of that.

Some notes:

* Be careful when it comes to recruiters, ask what fee they will take from the employer, if they manage to arrange a contract. I once had one that demanded 18% of my first years salary - some companies will not consider you, if it is that expensive and you can't simply apply for the same job on your own.

* I would not advise to learn Swiss German. I am a native german speaker and after 2 years have still trouble to communicate with the Swiss. There is not that one Swiss German one can learn but more one dialect for every valley.

* The Swiss are correct in everything they do and they seem to lack any form of humor when it comes to correctness. Get used to it. Enjoy it. (There is a BIG plus side to this.) Be aware that unpaid bills, missed appointments, poorly parked cars or misunderstandings with the rules of garbage collection *will* have consequences.",0,1408693217,null,0,1408694230,0,cjxahjn,t3_2e7wb7,t1_cjxahjn,t3_2e7wb7,null,1435374784,10,false,Switzerland,t5_2qhp6,10
true,Kapensteijn,ag,Aargau,"Sounds like you have a solid plan and a solid background (in a couple years). To answer some of your questions, as immigrant from an EU country myself:

* The Swiss people as a whole can come over as a bit xenophobic, you might hear some discriminating things on the radio for instance, not to mention the result of the mass immigration initivative referendum. However, as individuals, I have found pretty much all Swiss people are very welcoming and friendly, as long as you contribute something to society (in the form of labour usually) and make an effort to assimilate. 

* Having looked for jobs in an engineering field in the last months I can say almost every company has a need for software engineers. In my region there is ABB, Alstom, Google, IBM, Rheinmetall, and many, many others. You just have to be sure to bring something to the table that not many others can.

* At the moment it is still relatively easy to work in Switzerland as an EU citizen. Basically you apply for a job, go through the recruitment process, and once you get a contract, that is basically your entry ticket into Switzerland. With the contract you can get a residence permit, bank account, and place to live. In a couple years things might change due to the aforementioned referendum, although I think for higher educated EU personnel, it will largely stay the same.

* I'd recommend learning German first. More people speak it, also in Switzerland, so it will be of more use to you. It's also easier to learn while not in a German speaking country. The Swiss German is something you need to pick up while here. If you've mastered the basics of German in the first place, you'll make your way through Swiss German in no time (if you make a bit of an effort that is)",0,1408694167,null,0,false,0,cjxapca,t3_2e7wb7,t1_cjxapca,t3_2e7wb7,null,1435374815,7,false,Switzerland,t5_2qhp6,7

&gt;__ESA/390__ (Enterprise Systems Architecture/390) was introduced in September 1990  and was [IBM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM)'s last [31-bit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/31-bit)-address/[32-bit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/32-bit)-data [mainframe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_mainframe) computing design, copied by [Amdahl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amdahl_Corporation), [Hitachi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hitachi,_Ltd.), and [Fujitsu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fujitsu) among other competitors. It was the successor of [System/370](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System/370) and, in turn, was succeeded by the [64-bit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/64-bit) [z/Architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z/Architecture) in 2000.

&gt;Machines supporting the architecture have been sold under the brand __System/390__ (__S/390__) from the beginning of the 1990s. The 9672 implementations of System/390 were the first high-end IBM mainframe architecture implemented first with [CMOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CMOS) CPU electronics rather than the traditional [bipolar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bipolar_junction_transistor) logic.
