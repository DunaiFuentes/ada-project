&gt;__Think of the children__ (and similar phrases citing the __interests of children__ including __what about the children__) can be used to justify why something should, or should not, be done. When used as a plea for pity, this [appeal to emotion](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appeal_to_emotion) can constitute a potential logical [fallacy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallacy), while when used as an appeal for sympathy for weaker members of society, or the [social good](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_good) of the long-term health and viability of a society, it can constitute an argument for [social justice](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_justice) generally accepted as appropriate.
