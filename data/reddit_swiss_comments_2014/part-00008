And then there is nature which is extraordinary! It sounds to me that zurich is a great city but not the best on the wallet if im going to be stationed there for 5 or so months. 
Also to mention, that the study visa permits me to work 15 hours per week during the semester. Is this a significant amount of money I will be making?",0,1389306578,null,0,false,0,celmwzd,t3_1us9ux,t1_celmwzd,t3_1us9ux,null,1431873839,1,false,Switzerland,t5_2qhp6,1
