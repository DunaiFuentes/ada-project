They take HD pics of your package as it arrives so you can read the label and stuff. They give you tons of shipping options, ranging from $10 to $100 it you want it in 3 days insured. Also they have their own insurance that involves opening your package and taking pictures of it, in case the items inside it get ""lost"". Really neat stuff.

Also, on Amazon.com (don't know about the others .fr .de...), there are usually different sellers for the same item.

Ingredients: 

* 250g old brown bread cut in small slices
* 25g butter
* 2 apples cut in small pieces
* 1 tablespoon sugar

For the topping:

* 6 eggs
* 200ml full-fat milk
* 1-2 tablespoons of sugar

Some cinnamon to sprinkle on top.

1. Roast the bread in the butter until it turns light-brown. Add the apples and continue roasting. Stir in the sugar.
2. Mix the eggs, milk and sugar. Pour them over the bread. Continue roasting on small fire until the eggs solidify.
3. Serve the resulting ""Vogelheu"" and sprinkle cinnamon on top.
