true,Castillion,sg,Rorschach/Basel,"This is a really interesting discussion, you get me to think about a system I didn't question for the last decade... It's almost like /r/changemyview.

First of all to make sure we have the same understanding of the election system. I thought it works like this (at least for the national council):

A vote for a person, let's say Hans Muster CVP, counts as a vote for the party (CVP) and a vote for the person (Hans Muster). In the end the seats will get distributed first according to party (most party get most seat and so on) and then to the persons with the most votes inside that party.

If I fill out the whole ballot with people from CVP, but write EVP in the top most field as the party vote, EVP will get no votes because the top field only accounts lines that you left empty. So in this case all my votes would go to CVP first, regardless of my EVP party vote, then to the persons names.

Now my vote for Hans Muster CVP will look like that in the end results:     
CVP = 50'000 votes + mine    
Hans Muster = 5'000 votes + mine

So my vote for the person will have a much higher impact (1/5'000) than the vote on the party (1/50'000). It will not change the position of the party as much at it changes the standing of the person. So the ""loss"" of a vote to the ""wrong party"" will be negligible compared to the ""gain"" of a vote for the ""right"" person.",0,1409851175,null,0,false,0,ck9343f,t3_2fg1l0,t1_ck9343f,t1_ck90uve,null,1427198567,2,false,Switzerland,t5_2qhp6,2

If you have not specified a party vote, they will simply be lost.

However, assuming you dislike Hans Muster CVP even though you like his party, then mark your ballot CVP and/or vote for other CVP candidates without striking Mr. Muster, your vote could still go towards him.

About the striking part: I imagine striking does the same as leaving a field empty. So if there are ten open seats and you write 9 CVP names, leave one line empty but give your party vote to CVP, then CVP will get 10 party votes und 9 people will each get one. If you take the prepared list of CVP and strike through Hans Muster then CVP will get 10 votes and each of the 9 candidates will get one. Exactely the same situation. So either way the situation is exactely the same for Hans Muster.

Because as far as I know your vote cannot suddenly go to another person.
