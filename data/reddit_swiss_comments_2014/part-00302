Not true.

Everyone with a basic understanding of the swiss labour market, including SECO, is very well aware of this.

false,nearly_god,null,null,"Oh, give me a break Mr. [MCG](http://i.imgur.com/hgxw1lC.jpg). Let's deal in facts not in feelings:

* Unemployment according to the [ILO-Standard](http://www.ilo.org/ilostat/faces/home/statisticaldata/datamapper?_adf.ctrl-state=e7pnl4jm3_4&amp;_afrLoop=341663027778102) is at 4.1% in Switzerland ([see here](http://i.imgur.com/y1LcEXn.png))
* It is true that unemployment in France and Italy is above 10%, but at the same time unemployment in Germany and Austria is approaching Swiss levels (see image above).

One of the main reasons, why unemployement is so low in Switzerland (Germany, and Austria) is that there is an alternative to academic studies. The dual educations system allows us to make manual labourers just as (or more) qualified and highly skilled as college graduates. Allowing companies to pay them a decent salary, because their labour produces enough value.

* In 1990 there was a housing crisis in Switzerland ([40 Milliarden einfach ""verbrannt"", NZZ](http://www.nzz.ch/aktuell/startseite/40-milliarden-einfach-verbrannt-1.13429281)). During the current crisis, apart from the year 2009, Switzerland has been constantly growing and has remained largely unaffected.
* There will always be people who are not fit to compete or worse people who do not want to work. But there is nothing that would amount to a problem that cannot be solved in Switzerland.
* Damned if they do, damned if they don't. If the French were also using ""your"" restaurants, ""your"" hotels, ""your"" theatres, you would be complaining about that instead.

Another reason why Switzerland does comparatively well is our tax system, we attract many companies and high value indiviuals with low taxes. Switzerland lures them away from other countries, gets a few additional tax dollars, which allows it to have lower taxes for all companies and individuals, in turn becoming more competitive over all. That is obviously not a model that can work for all countries, but it works for Switzerland. (Whether this is ethical is another question).

The pressure you may be feeling is the effect we are all feeling. Life for employees has become more competitive, job security is a term that makes hardly sense anymore. Rents have gone up in areas that are highly desired (mainly urban), whereas in the countryside they are still laughably cheap. We use a lot more space than we used to. Mobility has increased steeply, we travel further and more often then we used. Immigration is just one factor in this development. I'm not saying it doesn't matter, I'm saying eliminating it will not solve any of your problems, but it will undermine our economy and thus will make the unemployment figures you seem to be wishing for real.
