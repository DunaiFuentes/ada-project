true,[deleted],null,null,"Too bad that we already export all the good souvenirs all over the world. It would be hard to find something that you couldn't find in the US as well.

That said, I'd still get a nice Swiss Army Knife (Victorinox). Either a small one to carry around everywhere (~18$) or one of the regular large ones (~30$). They are really nicely built and last forever. I use mine all the time. Prices are about the same everywhere, you can even get a small selection at the local supermarkets.

If you need a watch, Swatch makes good cheap ones starting at ~40$. While they are not Omega/Rolex/etc. the quality is good and they do last. I don't think you could get higher quality at that price.

If you like peeling vegetables or potatoes, you can get the best peeler in the world for just CHF 1.90. [Some guy became a millionaire](http://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/1sym2i/interview_with_joe_ades_who_became_a_millionaire/) selling these in New York for 5$ each. Just note: You'll want the [original one](http://imgur.com/Ge39vT5) from Migros or Globus, not any of the Chinese knockoffs (which funnily enough, are more expensive). For reference: the model is [Rex, made by Zena](http://www.zena-swiss.com/de/produkte/wissenswertes/rex-sparschaeler).

Maybe you need a metal water bottle? The traditional [metal Sigg bottles](https://www.sigg.com/en_ch/content/?page=en/collections/classics/) have been around forever.

Some other Swiss things that will unfortunately not fit into your budget: [Freitag](http://www.freitag.ch/) messenger bags (made out of used truck tarp, all the rage here), and [Mammut](http://www.mammut.ch/) climbing and outdoor gear.

And of course edibles which you don't want (why, oh why!)
