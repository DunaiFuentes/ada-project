true,giggles91,vs,Valais,"Hi there, I'm a bachelor student at EPFL.

I'd say if you already have something temporary for the first few weeks or even months then it's much better to look for something permanent once you are in Lausanne, since it's pretty hard to actually get something if you're not able to be here in person. Also it's risky because you won't know what you're going to get if you're actually getting something. It took me only around 3 weeks to find a flat in Lausanne, so I was lucky. It depends a lot on how much time you have for the search. Also it will be easier for you to find something since you have a stable income, most agencies ask you for proof that you have sufficient income if you want to get your own flat.

EPFL has a good site with tips and links for housing: http://logement.epfl.ch/housing but you need a GASPAR Account (some kind of EPFL online authentification that you either already got or will get soon) 

To learn some French I advise you to use www.duolingo.com . They have a pretty awesome French course and you can learn some basics rather quickly, all for free. You can take (free?) classes on campus once you're here.

Also EPFL is awesome! It's a really dynamic university where a lot of cool stuff is happening currently (Human Brain Project, construction of the SwissTech Convention) EPFL also hosts the biggest Open-Air-Festival in Europe organized by students, called [Balelec](http://www.balelec.ch), taking place in May.
