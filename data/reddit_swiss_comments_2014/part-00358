false,LaoBa,zh,Zürich,"From the 1992 editon of Van Dale Groot Woordenboek der Nederlandse Taal (an authoritative dictionary):

**Zwitser**  
1. zie bij **Zwitsers** 2. huursoldaat; -(ook) livreibediende: (zegsw) *geen geld, geen Zwitsers*, wie geen geld heeft, kan geen macht uitoefenen, zich niet van de dienst van een ander verzekeren; (gew.) *zo zat als een Zwitser*, zie bij *zat*; (gew) een baard als een Zwitser*, een lange zware baard; 3. ben. voor de leden van de pauselijke garde (waarvoor vroeger Zwitserse huursoldaten werden aangeworven).

**Swiss** 1. see **Swiss** (adjective) 2. Mercenary; -(also) lackey; (saying) *No money, no Swiss*, who has no money has no power, can't assure himself of the service of others; (local use) *As drunk as a Swiss*, see under *drunk*; (local use) *A beard like a Swiss*, a long, heavy beard; 3. Name for the members of the papal guard, which used to consist of Swiss mercenaries.

So we see that these expressions in Dutch most likely date from the time when the most Swiss people in the Netherlands were Swiss mercenaries, with beards and occasionally drunk. Large numbers of Swiss served in the Dutch army between 1666 and 1829.  

In older dictionaries we also find that the word Zwitser was used in Dutch for a dagger (the [Schweizerdolch](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swiss_dagger) used by the Swiss mercenaries), (in certain regions) for persons with certain undesirable traits and for cowherds (in Limburg only). Interestingly enough, the Dutch also used the verb Zwitseren (""to Swiss"") of cursing, again probably based on the behavior of mercenaries.",0,1417201559,null,0,false,0,cmfgqsj,t3_2nh2ik,t1_cmfgqsj,t1_cmdijzg,null,1425799568,2,false,Switzerland,t5_2qhp6,2

Edit: And maybe look at [the Reddiquette](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette), it exists for a reason and you might learn something. 

Relevant exceprs from the Reddiquette:

&gt;Please don't  be (intentionally) rude at all. By choosing not to be rude, you increase the overall civility of the community and make it better for all of us.

&gt;Please don't  conduct personal attacks on other commenters. Ad hominem and other distracting attacks do not add anything to the conversation.

&gt;Please don't insult others. Insults do not contribute to a rational discussion. Constructive Criticism, however, is appropriate and encouraged.

&gt;Please don't make comments that lack content. Phrases such as ""this"", ""lol"", and ""I came here to say this"" are not witty, original, or funny, and do not add anything to the discussion.

&gt;Please don't complain about other users reposting/rehosting stories, images, videos, or any other content. Users should give credit where credit should be given, but if someone fails to do so, and is not causing harm, please either don't point it out, or point it out politely and leave it at that. They are only earning karma, which has little to no use at all.

&gt;Please don't complain about reposts. Just because you have seen it before doesn't mean everyone has. Votes indicate the popularity of a post, so just vote. Keep in mind that linking to previous posts is not automatically a complaint; it is information. 

&gt;Please do remember the human. When you communicate online, all you see is a computer screen. When talking to someone you might want to ask yourself ""Would I say it to the person's face?"" or ""Would I get jumped if I said this to a buddy?""

&gt;Please adhere to the same standards of behavior online that you follow in real life.

&gt;Please read the reddiquette. Read it again every once in a while. Reddiquette is a living, breathing, working document which may change over time as the community faces new problems in its growth.

To my knowledge CERN is mainly focused on running and improving the colliders. There are a couple of the very best scientists (after their PhD) which are funded directly by CERN.  
The big majority of experimental and theoretical particle physicists working at the CERN experiments belong to one of the many institutes around the world which are part of a collaboration. Those institutes are mainly part of universities and funded by national science funding agencies.  
Those teams collaborate with each other and often have someone directly at CERN. Usually, if you do your PhD for instance at ATLAS, your home institute sends you to CERN for a couple of months.  
I don't really know what's the situation with the theoretical physicists. While I as an experimental particle physicist with a big LHC collaboration don't really need to be at CERN (the data goes to the worldwide LHC grid anyway, we see each others at international conferences and in daily video conferences etc.), theoretical physicists have no reason to be at the experiments whatsoever. There are a couple of theorists at CERN anyway, but it's likely very hard to get a fulltime position there. I think many if not all are paid by their home institutions.  
If you want to have a look and be directly at CERN, apply for the summer student programme. Otherwise - if you want to do particle physics with the CERN experiments - look for an university with a group that matches your interest. They are very likely to have positions to do an internship, a bachelor thesis or master thesis. Next step will be PhD. If you performed well with your masters task, chances are high your group leader will find a way to keep you as a PhD student (and pay you or find a scholarship suitable for you).",0,1417215308,null,0,false,0,cmfn57x,t3_2npca1,t1_cmfn57x,t3_2npca1,null,1425796559,3,false,CERN,t5_2r692,3

**Driving on the side walk**

Let's take [this situation](https://www.google.ch/maps/@47.3834247,8.548216,3a,75y,8.98h,69.64t/data=!3m4!1e1!3m2!1sqd3EBCPVv_lJiBSbCb3cBA!2e0?hl=de). The street is narrow as fuck, there is no way you can get past these cars without having to evade to the side walk or on the lane where trams are driving to the left.. and we know how dangerous the tram lane is.. even for cars.  
Also the side walk is super broad. [Here](https://www.google.ch/maps/@47.3825189,8.5481938,3a,75y,64.71h,91.45t/data=!3m4!1e1!3m2!1sWBBz9ZAyBprYlnqZTSxG1w!2e0?hl=de) a car even parks on it and people can still walk past.

There are numerous situations in Zurich where the side walk is so fucking broad the planers put the cycle lanes on it. Like [in Gessnerallee](https://www.google.ch/maps/@47.373898,8.5334539,3a,75y,218.59h,80.26t/data=!3m4!1e1!3m2!1s6rEksSyFuuMzH1e_X8MYRA!2e0?hl=de).  
I mean seriously. What is this?

Then later after the crossing we see [this](https://www.google.ch/maps/@47.3720848,8.5321047,3a,75y,218.59h,80.26t/data=!3m4!1e1!3m2!1s3qu2m2nX5Yzj3-XEhMapbg!2e0?hl=de), all the while cyclists have to drive on the narrow side walk. Cross a dangerous street where the countryside people from central Switzerland sometimes race on. I see these as ""go fuck yourself"" for cyclists all the time.

[This](https://www.google.ch/maps/@47.37077,8.5495049,3a,75y,254.08h,82.21t/data=!3m4!1e1!3m2!1sGpxvb3j4uo9lwF-o_x-mOg!2e0?hl=de) here on the other side of the street is another classic. There is no space for cyclists at all. During rush hour you have to either evade to the left (tram lane) or right (side walk). [See how narrow this is?](https://www.google.ch/maps/@47.3703844,8.5489389,3a,75y,204.32h,67.39t/data=!3m4!1e1!3m2!1sRnioF_Grv1nBL3zC1Cd91w!2e0?hl=de) Fuck this.  
A bit further [down](https://www.google.ch/maps/@47.3686994,8.5474492,3a,75y,211.24h,80.51t/data=!3m4!1e1!3m2!1syvj2U5GBdFK4XUVdCDmfvw!2e0?hl=de) the fucking side walk is wider than the street. And you almost *never* see anybody walking there while the lane is so narrow that a cyclist can't pass. Of course we have to drive on the side walk.

**Pedestrians not looking**

Ever crossed [this street](https://www.google.ch/maps/place/Theaterhaus+Gessnerallee/@47.3716356,8.5429869,3a,75y,190.57h,83.6t/data=!3m5!1e1!3m3!1su9JbLVWXSgUAAAAGOw1p4w!2e0!3e11!4m2!3m1!1s0x47900a05b3c9f8c7:0xf1c18ad7dce9ff1d?hl=de) without looking? Also not using the crosswalk at all? You wouldn't be the first: like every second pedestrian who crosses the Limmatquai I almost hit.

I gotta say, almost half the pedestrians already have one foot on the street until they look if something might be approaching to hit them. This is especially problematic because bicycles are quieter than cars and we're driving on the right side of the street.. usually just there where your foot is.

That said, when you look and it's clear you want to cross.. Yeah, to everybody who then doesn't let you cross: ""go fuck yourself"".

**Driving on the cross walk**

I hate that too. But honestly, most of it is due to the streets being really stupid lain out in Zurich. It's the same for cars only for them it's a bit less horrible to have to drive huge detours to get where they want to go.  
[Like HB](https://www.google.ch/maps/place/Theaterhaus+Gessnerallee/@47.3783503,8.5412226,3a,75y,88.97h,88.87t/data=!3m4!1e1!3m2!1sDHkkX_vvpeXjMLGJKBxeeA!2e0!4m2!3m1!1s0x47900a05b3c9f8c7:0xf1c18ad7dce9ff1d?hl=de).

Good thing they improved HB recently. It's not on Street View yet, but the bike lane is safer now.

If turning left would be easier I bet cyclists wouldn't use the cross walk as much. Zurich is not really bike friendly that way.

**Other stuff**

[This](https://www.google.ch/maps/@47.3979968,8.5355675,3a,75y,73.72h,71.93t/data=!3m4!1e1!3m2!1sh8Ua090tI5hOHIQR94ZTog!2e0?hl=de) is another favorite ""go fuck yourself"" moment. The bike lane just stops. You can see it down in the corner.

This is what I don't get, and why a lot of other cyclists drive me mad: **You are the same traffic as cars are!** Just like cars and scooters and trucks and trams. You're not entitled ""to get past these cars""! I don't like it either, but if there's a column of cars waiting without a bike lane being there you have three options:

* If the cars leave a lane *on the right side* with enough space for you to pass through, you may overtake them. They are not required to do this, it's not mandatory.
* Wait in line! Stop, put your foot down and wait for your turn to advance.
* Get off the bike and walk.

We bikers have the same rights on the road as cars (except for driving on the Autobahn). But at the same time we have the same duties, too. Think about what would happen if a car hopped on the sidewalk for a bit (e.g. at Europaallee where it is wide enough).

----

That said, you've touched on a lot of points where I totally agree. Pedestrians at Limmatquai (my route for commuting) are horrible, most of them don't realize it's a street and not a pedestrians area.

I don't see a problem here. The bike lane is just merging into the regular road. They could have painted the lines a couple of meters further up to the other merge ahead, though. But you missed my absolute favorite fucking stopping bike lane (on my former commute):

[This glorious example at Shilcity](https://www.google.ch/maps/@47.3601857,8.5229033,3a,75y,51.41h,70.9t/data=!3m4!1e1!3m2!1s0NYNQWmkmjGlNuPdelsocQ!2e0?hl=de).

Not only is there fucking tree in the way, you're ending up right in the middle of the bus stop with a high sidewalk step so you can't just drive down into the street (which you only can do if there's not a bus parked there anyways). Every other meter of road around Sihlcity has terrific bike lanes, but these 10 meters of turning right into Manessestrasse have the worst.

Wait, do I get that right. OP is suggesting an exception and the above sentence would call for an exception of that exception?

In general, I think some traffic laws of the US are worth considering (e.g. turn right on red, or right overtake on highway). Creating different means for the same signalisation according to your use of transportation is sure a new path for us. Considering that we can't even drive correctly in a roundabout or with trams, I personally believe it would not gain in a security benefit. But that's obviously not the point of OP's suggestion. The point is that cyclists can move quicker and more efficiently by having to stop fewer times. The benefit would probably be measurable for bicycle couriers in the city, but that's also the major cyclist group ignoring red lights, or traffic rules in general, on a regular basis (at least what I have seen in Zurich). The bottom line could be: gain of quicker bicycle travel for few, imposing new risks for many.

After all, what would help is that we all try to recall what it means being on a different vehicle. Since I regularly cycle myself, I am a different driver. I now realize more why the cyclist is in the middle of the road (for his safety in curvy downhill streets), that I overtake a cyclist only if I can fully drive on the left side and that I have to assume most drivers don't understand my situation while on the bike. So after all, instead of proposing a new regulation, I would propose to get drivers on the street on a bike and have them realize what it feels like being on the street.
