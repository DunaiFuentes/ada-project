true,brumgabrasch,null,null,"I'm no expert, just keep in mind that a river is not like a swimming pool. It can be dangerous if you are not a decent swimmer. Actually every year a few people die in the Aare. Most of them are not good swimmers and overestimate their abilities or are drunk.

There are a few bridges on the way. Take care that you cross them well between the pillars. The current is quite strong and colliding with a pillar is not healthy.  If it's sunny and hot, keep in mind that the water can be still quite cold if you fall in. Check your route on Google Maps and compare it with the Aarekarte. Remember where you have to get out. The best place in my opinion is the Eicholz.  At the Marzili you must get out! There are places where it has vortex (Wasserwirbel). I was never in one. It was told to me to keep calm and swim below the surface away. I don't know if this is the right thing to do.  There are barriers to slow the current at the side that reach into the river. Therefore stay in the middle. 

Don't get me wrong, with some common sense it is pretty safe. A lot of people do it. You just don't have the safety of a swimmpool with life guards. I think for people living close to rivers this is clear.",0,1403544041,null,0,false,0,ciez0io,t3_28s5mb,t1_ciez0io,t3_28s5mb,null,1434367294,1,false,Switzerland,t5_2qhp6,1
