true,Formagella,ti,Ticino,"it's still an insult and you can be sued for that. 

Asylum seeker or foreigner are not races. 

When it comes to citizenship though, there's where the sentence gets sketchy. Because albanian might be the citizenship but it might also be the ethnicity. 

There are many countries named after their titular nation. 

From a rational one-fits-all point of view they are right. Citizenship is in general and in most places in the world unrelated to ethnicity/nation. So it's not a racial insult to say e.g. south african, because maybe it's a white guy, maybe it's black, maybe someone hates just the british ones and not the afrikaaner so it's not even about skin color. 

A difficult example: Saumakedonier is not a racial slur, because macedonian is a citizenship and not a race. But then, if you want to racially insult a macedonian, you have to refer to his ethnicity. That means:
1. bulgarian
2. albanian
3. gypsy

now if you say some racial epithet about gypsies, then it's a racial slur. But then, it should also be that way when you say albanian or bulgarian. 
But albanian and bulgarian are citizenships too. 

So the insult to an albanian macedonian is also racially motivated only if you know beforehand that the guy is not also a citizen of the country named after his ethnicity? 

It's weird.
