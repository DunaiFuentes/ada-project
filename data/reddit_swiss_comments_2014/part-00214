&gt;

&gt;__Alemannic__ (German:  *Alemannisch* (help·info)) is a group of [dialects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialect) of the [Upper German](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upper_German) branch of the [Germanic language family](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germanic_language). It is spoken by approximately ten million people in eight countries: [Switzerland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switzerland), [Germany](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany), [Austria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austria), [Liechtenstein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liechtenstein), [France](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France), [Italy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy), [Venezuela](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venezuela) ([Colonia Tovar dialect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colonia_Tovar_dialect)) and the [US](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US) (by some [Amish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amish) groups). The name derives from the ancient Germanic alliance of tribes known as the [Alamanni](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alamanni) (""all men"").
