Lausanne is a great, vibrant city, so you should enjoy your stay there, but there is also a lot to experience nearby. If you enjoy history, then you will find yourself tripping over it frequently; for example, I happened across a plaque marking the place where artist Gustave Courbet lived until his passing, just down the street from our place (in La Tour-de-Peilz). Yesterday, I found [this plaque](http://imgur.com/UqkFxSn)

I'm Swiss and I have been living in Lausanne for the past 10 years or so. I have studied 5 years in the university of Lausanne.

Lausanne is a great city. Although finding a place to live in is a pain in the ass so I hope you have that covered for you.

It is a quite expensive place but if you have the means then you'll have a lot of fun. There is two canadian bars that I know of, the ""gosses du québec"" wich is a typical sport bar I'd say, hold by a canadian and another one where I've never been to which is near the ""place central"" but unfortunatly I don't know it's name.

Other wise there a lot of different type of places to go to at night, ranging from the nice little bar to huge night clubs. If you want some tips for nice places just ask away. My personal favorite is the Pi bar, a small bar not too far away from the center that has a huge beer choice and beer tasting first mondays of each month.

I think the city is quite safe and very nice looking. Be sure to enjoy the lake during the summer time with bbq and swimming!

The university is very nice, it's a bit out of the city. It's very near the lake. It offers a lot of sports and activities so be sure to check them out : [http://sport.unil.ch/](http://sport.unil.ch/)

There is a small (very small) market on the campus and 2 bars (be sure to check Satellite which is very a very good bar, kinda small but has a huge beer selection at low prices!
