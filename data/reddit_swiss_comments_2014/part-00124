I am swiss, I am native swiss german speaking and I think it's something we have to change about our culture, though.

After living abroad for almost a year I went back to Switzerland for a visit. My plane arrived in Basel from where I took the train to my hometown. Shortly after the train left, the conductor entered the wagon and started checking the tickets. The train was headed to Olten. When the conductor checked the ticket of a guy of arabian descent he looked at him and said in a simplified, wrongly stressed, and broken swiss german: ""dasch falsche ticket. Dasch diräkt Delément. Muesch andere kaufe"" to which the guy replied: ""oh das tuet mir leid, i han gmeint das giltet au wenni öber Olte fahre."" in an absolute perfect basilean dialect. This guy made a mistake, an honest mistake that can happen to people that don't take trains very often. I was embarassed.

So regular tickets per adult, 2nd class, about:
Zurich Airport =&gt; Lauterbrunnen CHF 79
Lauterbrunnen =&gt; Zermatt CHF 87
Zermatt =&gt; Geneva Airport CHF 97
Total = 263

There is the Swiss Pass (http://www.swiss-pass.ch/en/swiss-pass), which allows unlimited travel on almost all public transportation, 50% on cable cars. Good if you want to go up to Mürren for example.

It's CHF 272 for 4 days, or 204 if your under 26. Plus you get 10% if you're in a group of 2 or more. So 272*0.9 = CHF 245. Which is slightly cheaper than individual tickets.

It's also annoying for all other team member because they have less time to focus on their own stuff. You would always prefer a team of people that doesn't do military.

That's not true at all, sorry. You're not from Zurich and/or you haven't worked in a lot of differen companies, right?

Doesn't that prove my point? I'm doing Zivilschutz and I met a ton of people from HSG and ETH there. They aren't left-wing / anti-military types, but they know that the army is just lost time and a disadvantage in the job market.
