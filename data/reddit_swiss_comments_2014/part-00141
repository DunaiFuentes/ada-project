No, they argued against it because it goes against the ''principe de proportionnalité''. That's a very important part of our legislation and it sucks that we have this piece of crap in our Constitution now.

There are still quite a few people that earn 3500-4000 but really not that many that earn &lt; 3500. Also they could have done something smart such as defining the minimum wage as 50% of the median wage in any canton / region. This would have hedged the minimum wage against inflation, would have reduced the critic that it's inflexible as it had an adjustment mechanism for local differences and 50% of the median income is in line with minimum wage in other countries (oppositions couldn't have campaigned against ""the highest minimum wage on the planet""). Recent studies actually found that low minimum wage don't have a negative effect. Economists usually say that high minimum wages destroy jobs, not any minimum wage (e.g. as in this [article](http://www.economist.com/news/leaders/21591593-moderate-minimum-wages-do-more-good-harm-they-should-be-set-technocrats-not)).

&gt; If you can say with 100% confidence that there will be no conflict in Europe in the next five to ten decades, then yeah, sure, we can scrap it.

There's a logical mistake in this argument: We can't predict the future especially not if you're talking about such very long time horizons and therefore we don't know which knowledge is relevant. Sorry, but 5 -10 decades is completely absurd. Even one decade is extremely difficult. But how can we maintain the right knowledge if we don't know who the enemy will be and how we will have to fight them? Just look at 'little green men' in Ukraine and how wars are fought in the media as an example. Does the Swiss army have any knowledge from the past to fight such a threat? Don't think so, look at how badly they looked in the media during the campaign.


I think the army is just maintaining some knowledge but not relevant knowledge. I don't think it makes sense to have an army against undefinable threats. The Swiss army should focus on real threats such as terror and cyber attacks and scrap all the old stuff. I'm fine with them having some fighter jets but just in cooperation with other countries to secure the airspace from terrorist and not an air force that would fight other countries.


There also a lot of corruption and crony capitalism going on. Firm that produce weapons and the army people pay and lobby for an army just because it's good for them, not because it's makes Switzerland more secure.

No, but there is a multi-billion program to upgrade the army's telecommunication capabilities, multi-millions projects in the cyber defence domain and the Sicherheitsverbund : http://www.vbs.admin.ch/internet/vbs/de/home/themen/security/svu14/uebersicht.html

So no, no one huge big ticket item, but a ton of initiatives addressing the various issues in that domain. It's by far not perfect, but you can't claim the army hasn't recognized the problem and isn't moving to address it.
