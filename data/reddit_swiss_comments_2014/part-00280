As I was planning to return to Switzerland after that to work, I decided to get my military service out of the way during the summer holidays of 95. We told the embassy who informed us that as I was going to Switzerland voluntarily to do my service, the state would pay for my flight there and back. Additionally when it came time to discuss me becoming a corporal with my Lieutenant, all he said was: Well you don't want to become a corporal and the state does not want to pay for you again, so we will not be forcing you to do so.

Yeah train tickets can get expensive pretty quickly. If you stay I would suggest you buy a *Halbtax*. It's about CHF 200.-, i think, but you just pay half price for tickets.

I wouldn't be worried about being exposed by the police, and if you are, just tell them when you call.

Don't let it go on too long, the sooner you call the cops on them, the better. Here, it took over a year to get them evicted from the building and it was a horrible until they finally got forcfully removed by the cops. If you want more information or anything, just let me know. 

Edit: We (other tennants from the same building) forced the Landlord to terminate their lease and have them evicted. We more or less threatened to pay rent to a ""Sperrkonto"" and only release once the issue was dealt with. That helped get things moved along. It sucks to do, but will be worth it in the end.
