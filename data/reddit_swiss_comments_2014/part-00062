true,TryingToHideHere,ag,Aargau,"I'm guessing the fear of sabotage through foreign combatants fighting for Switzerland would be to large. I don't think they would allow you to join. Lots of people I've talked to have expressed that they would rather fight a guerilla war against any invaders rather than mobilize with their respective companies to die a pointless death. I don't think the Swiss armed forces would actually stand a chance in case of a serious invasion by any one. So guerilla would appear much more reasonable to me than anything else.

true,fusionove,ti,Ticino,"&gt; They decide after 6(!) weeks who is going to be an officer!
