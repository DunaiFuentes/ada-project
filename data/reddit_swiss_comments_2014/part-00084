If not, they'll need to send someone that connects your line in the cellar (Given that you have a phone or fibre line that goes to the appartment. But I've never seen one without.).

For the options: Cablecom is cheaper, but if you run into a problem they are often a nightmare to deal with. Swisscom is a bit more expensive, but generally more stable and better service. 


Edit: One thing to add. If the landlord tells you the Cablecom connection is already set up, then he is adding something like a 25 SFr. hidden charge to your rent every month because you can watch TV.

With Cablecom you would get a wireless router to plug in. Some configuration and safety details and off you go. I imagine your place has phone lines, so Swisscom installation shouldn't be any more involved. They may try to charge some kind of ""connection fee"", but it's a racket (usually. These days.), and you could counter with ""oh, well, I'll talk with Cablecom then, they promised free connection"". 

I can vouch for Swisscom as fairly reliable and their customer support has been pleasant. Haven't heard anything negative about Cablecom.

I wasn't hinting at him trying to rip you off. This is just the way it usually works. The landlord usually makes a deal with cablecom for TV and connects every apartment. It is entirely possible of course that your connection really is physically disconnected in the cellar, but I've never seen that in any appartment. I had to seal it off every time in the apartment because of the way the coax cables are laid out. So best just check, I really doubt what your landlord said here!

A few days I guess. The last time I ordered something from cablecom it took a few months and a lawyer... (Yes I hate that company) ;)

The exposure for banks is significant because they generally take on significant maturity risk with lending activities, that is the cash deposited can be demanded at any time but they maybe have lent that cash out for a mortgage that takes 30 years to mature. This risk is why deposit insurance exists, preventing bank runs. If the banks held 100% reserves that would prevent bank runs too, but what other business is expected to hold 100% of its liabilities in cash? That's simply unreasonable.
