The NZZ is undoubtedly the bestt newspaper Switzerland has - and it needs to maintain that high standard. Great to see their associates taking a stand against giving it away to the radical conservatives.

Just to tell you how shitty Markus Somm is, let me rant a little. This isn't objective,, but my parents used to get the BaZ each morning and it's kind of sad that it's become as shit as it is now. So my views are *somewhat* one-sided.

As somebody living in Basel, the BaZ has gone to shit under Somm. It never was a great newspaper to begin with, but since that cunt took over it's turned to complete shit. Here is an overview of the assholish dicks Markus Somm hired:

- Michael Bahnerth: By now kind of well known in Basel, as he's written [this unresearched, sexist and offensive piece of bullshit](http://bazonline.ch/basel/stadt/Eva-Herzog--Annaeherung-an-eine-Unnahbare/story/21799182) about Eva Herzog. She (understandably) didn't want to talk to a newspaper controlled by that fuckwit Blocher, which he doesn't understand. What are her motives for turning down his request? 

&gt; Haben sie ihre ersten ungelenken Interviews als Regierungsrätin traumatisiert? Fühlt sie sich unsicher mit den Dossiers ihres Lebens? Hat sie mal im Bett mit einer lesbischen Freundin gekifft?

- Mischa Hauswirth: This little cunt was hired simply to constantly write about how horrible life in Basel is. The thing that pushed me over the edge with this fucker was when he [wrote about refugees](http://bazonline.ch/basel/stadt/Basler-Asylheim-wird-laenger-offen-bleiben/story/17091096?track) living in a house close to where I live. In the article, some SVP guy and a random anonymous person (representing the whole fucking neighborhood and surprisingly 100% in line with the SVP shithead) gets to speak. Nobody else. And the truth is, you don't HARDLY even notice the refugees. The whole fucking neighborhood is way too diverse for that. But goddamn, I'm scared every time I leave my flat about being mugged by some refugee from Eritrea. Sure.

- Aaaron Agnozzola (or something like that): This little dick is an actual member of the SVP and gets to interview other little dicks from the SVP, [like their Prophet](http://bazonline.ch/schweiz/standard/Eine-Sache-falsch-eingeschaetzt-zu-haben-ist-ja-noch-keine-Todsuende/story/17101622?track) or local asshole Sebastian Frehner. Apart from that, he specializes in criticizing the AWFUL INCOMPETENT left wing politicians because of how parking spots are administered or how a tram is being built (or whatever, these are examples that just come to mind, didn't necessarily read that shit).

- Dominik Feusi: What a cunt. Member of the [""Ordnungspolitischer Blog""](http://www.ordnungspolitik.ch/author/dominik-feusi/), whatever the fuck that exactly is supposed to mean. In it, meaningful articles are posted, e.g. ""Von Thatcher lernen heisst Siegen lernen"" or ""Machtkartell von Mitte-Links"". Here are some of his last articles he wrote for BaZ:
* Aus Asylanten werden Sozialhilfefälle (10.12)
* Bund finanziert Wellness für Schwule (09.12)
* Das bundesrätliche Wohlfühl-Kartell (28.10)
* «Was für eine perverse Idee» (09.09, about the Kantonsfusion, something BaZ was campaining strongly against)
* Das Machtkartell von Mitte-Links (Oh look, the same as on his ""liberal"" blog)
* Warum wir Amerikaner werden sollten (about why we should rather join the USA than the EU)

- Nina Jecker: This cunt focuses on how BAAAAD it has become in Basel. Junkies everywhere! Look at [her page on BaZ](http://bazonline.ch/stichworte/stichwort/autor/nina-jecker/s.html) and tell me this type of ""journalism"" is not politically motivated.

- Daniel Wahl: Gets to write about how BAD everything is. [Here is one of the many reasons](http://www.tageswoche.ch/de/blogs/schrotundkorn/607524/) to hate that cunt.

So all in all, I'm glad that fucking asshole Markus Somm has to go to work in that part of Basel which allegedly is [essentially run by terrorists](http://bazonline.ch/basel/stadt/Basler-Muslime-rufen-zum-heiligen-Krieg-auf/story/18444809) (it's where he moved the headquarters to, Kleinbasel).

I really like the NZZ - hopefully they won't follow Baz or Weltwoche into being national conservative shit papers.
