One of the busiest bridges in Basel, Johanniterbrucke, has an intersection which sorely could use stop signs or yield marks or something. I've seen so many accidents [there](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Basel,+Johanniterbr%C3%BCcke/@47.5644679,7.5837035,3a,75y,128.7h,90t/data=!3m4!1e1!3m2!1sFRt5Dz68uEoYEPtO-pNtcg!2e0!4m7!1m4!3m3!1s0x4791b9a6f59429ab:0x89bbf93a317fde3c!2sJohanniterbr%C3%BCcke,+Basel,+Switzerland!3b1!3m1!1s0x4791b9a7b05b8df1:0x1dc495120b0d541d).

Most of the traffic lacks bike lanes. You share the lane with cars. There are seemingly 100 tram lines coming through the intersection at different angles and the pedestrians are running across the streets at completely random places to catch their tram.

Switzerland has relatively low taxes already and offers much more than just that to a rich person. Safety, a stable political situation, good financial services and insurance companies, fantastic infrastructure, low VAT, low crime rate, great nature, reliable government services and more. 

If you've ever waited 8 months for an ADSL connection in Germany and when you finally got it, it ran at only one tenth the advertised speed, but there's nothing you can do because the alternative would be no Internet connection at all, then you know there's a big difference between here and even our closest neighbors.

Well, the voters decided, but I don't think it would've hurt. Numbers from cantons that already dumped flat rate taxes showed that even though rich people moved to other cantons, tax income was actually higher than before:

At the end this vote was BS for  part of the Switzerland, it should be a Cantonal choice due to the huge difference in the matter.

Any way, in general, letting rich Company and rich people paying less taxes is totally fucked up and stupid.

If certain Company don't wont to pay the right amount of taxes to establish  their business here:   fuck them!!!!!!  we don't need this kind of Company, we can survive without them and find others who are willing to pay taxes like everyone else.
