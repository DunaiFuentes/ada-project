They must also tell you where this person moved if you have a justified reason (which is the case here). So if he did move to another place in Switzerland you can go and request the same information from the new town/city again.

Do you know if he lived in the city of Zurich or somewhere else in the Canton (like a state/province) of Zurich? If he did live in the city the best way to find out is to contact their Residents’ Office which can be reached under this phone number: +41 44 412 11 11
They should be able to help you. Be aware that they state that due to data protection laws they are not allowed to give you this info by phone. But I'm sure they're able to tell how you would have to request it (I assume by letter or similar). Also be aware that there will almost definitely be a small charge for the info, according to their website www.stadt-zuerich.ch (partially available in English) this cost will be between 10 and 30 Swiss Francs (120-370 South African Rand).

Let me know if I can be of more assistance.
