true,netheranthem,null,null,"Hello there!

I've been using my insurance extensively (sadly), so I hope my experience will be of use to you. The cheapest insurers (like Assura and CSS) are attractive, but you'll have to sue them to get your money back if you get in a weird case (For example, some providers didn't want to reimburse me things that were covered by the basic insurance, I'm still in the process to this day) To avoid that, consumer ratings on comparis.ch can be helpful.

Also there are three schemes of insurance.

- LaMal (Regular Coverage)
- Family Doctor (You have to get recommended to specialists through your family doctor. Not recommended unless you know the guy already).
- TelMed (You have to call the insurance before going anywhere. This is the definition, for me, of hell on earth).

If you can afford it, I'd recommend LaMal, so that if you've got a problem, you can go right away to the specialist and get treatment. In some cases, it is quite important for your health, or most often it already benefits your comfort! (Also, if you don't work yet, as it's been said previously, get the accident insurance atop of the regular health insurance. It's pretty cheap anyway, but it is probably the most important part, as accidents can cause serious or even life-long injuries that diseases only rarely cause. Plus, accident coverage is usually more thorough, so declare any in-between case as an accident).

When it comes to the franchise, if you don't spend that much on medicine / treatment (say less than 1000 bucks a year), I recommend you take the 3000 francs franchise. Otherwise, after some point, 300 francs is best. You'll have to calculate it depending on your situation, but if anything happens, this is a detail you can change every year. I myself was under 3000.- before I had to take more medication, so I went down to 300.- the next year. Me and my parents always calculate those kind of things, and it never made sense to take a franchise anywhere in between (unless you're really short and can't spend 3000 francs if something serious happens, but then you should get some savings and go to 3000 francs the year after).",0,1403197878,null,0,1403198126,0,cibqkm2,t3_28gope,t1_cibqkm2,t3_28gope,null,1434311252,2,false,Switzerland,t5_2qhp6,2
