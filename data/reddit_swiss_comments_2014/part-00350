The SNB Billanz has increased from 100 billion to 500 billion. If inventing new money *on this scale* is the opposite of ""slowing down"", then I'm all for slowing down.

Sure, we can discuss about imaginary numbers and future prices of gold etc. But ultimately that doesn't affect many people directly. What is much more interesting to look at is how the everyday Swiss citizen will be affected and that is directly tied to his or her ability to keep their job. ""You gonna lose your job."" is not a cheap cop-out, but the end result of a complicated discussion about economics. The end result for non-economists.  
I gotta agree, that I usually don't like the threats of economists either, but with the gold initiative it's pretty obvious that it's not an empty threat.

Money is basically just negative debt or the promise that debt is payed back after a certain time frame. Money supply is controlled by interest rates that incentivize how much credit/debt everybody gets.  
That's how money is created: By causing more people to owe you more by increasing interest rates. That's also by the way why in early day banking interest rates were heavily disputed. Sharia Law forbids interest rates and also the Vatican back in the day forbade it.

Anyway, what the gold initiative will do is bind the SNBs hands, which you clearly seem to be for, even though it only has to do with imaginary numbers that don't directly effect you. It will also create a guaranteed buyer of gold on the market, which basically makes the SNB the victim of speculators. Also I question if the gold price is really as [stable](http://www.macrotrends.net/1333/gold-and-silver-prices-100-year-historical-chart) as everybody says it is.  

Also the value of our money comes down to trust. Trust that we can pay our bills. However we're ***NOT*** allowed to sell any gold. How the hell are people going to trust a currency that is backed by gold that cannot be touched. Is it really backed by 
 gold if the gold can't be used?

Some people say the franc will gain so much value that it going to destroy our export industries and basically put people on the street. Obviously certain proponents of this initiative hope that it will mostly be foreigners that lose their job and that it will slow down immigration rates. This makes sense, because whenever our economy was booming compared to our neighbors we had an increase in immigrants.  
And this was basically the main point I was hinting at when I said anti-growth people could be for this initiative: It probably crashes our export industries, put people on the street and immigrants will leave.

You know who will leave as well? Well educated Swiss people who are not bound locally to their jobs in Switzerland. This will cause a brain drain and damage Switzerland's most important asset: Know how.

Sure, if the Franc does not gain that much in value, it will only limit the possibilities of the SNB. It will lose control over its own businesses and foreign gold speculators will gain that control.
