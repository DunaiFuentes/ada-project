To get your spoken German going, you need some kind of immersion program. It's how I learned, and it makes all the difference. 

The difference between high German and Swiss German is closer to the difference between Spanish and Portuguese. My own command of Swiss German remains tenuous - I frequently have remind people to switch when they push me too far from my zone of knowledge. As one of my German colleagues put it, ""in one year you understand Swiss German, and in two you understand Dutch."" You can, legitimately, make it without Swiss German, but you do need to be prepared for the language's prevalence, because if your spoken German isn't cracking on all cylinders, you are really going to do your head in. 

I appreciate that you are really trying to have a plan and work your way there methodically. What I see, though, is that you have picked a very small, distant, isolated target to shoot at. You really have one site at one potential employer. Either he takes you or not. If not...then, well, you are low on options. Honeywell has a site in the French region, but it's not manufacturing. And it's French. SAFRAN? French. Dassault? French. Fokker? Rolled into Airbus, now French. GE? They are JV'd with Snecma in France. Thales? French again, though there is German presence. Rheinmetall? Maybe, but that's Germany. Airbus Munich? Ditto. Any of these options still leave you outside looking in, trying to knock on the same door. 

If your plan works - brilliant. If not...I don't see a plan b. And keep in mind that all Swiss manufacturing has a HUGE black cloud over it right now thanks to the aforementioned immigration vote. And this was after the currency put it on the ropes. Me and every other manufacturer in Switzerland were staring death in the face in 2011 just on currency. 

Whilst I appreciate that you are really trying to make this happen, it's a huge ask. Even with the preparation, you need a lot of things to go right. Give yourself more options than UAVs. Work on a Latin language, as the European aerospace industry is really French, British, and, Italian. Work on getting in the door with a multinational near you, and then try to transfer, or at least have an ""industry experience"" line on your CV, rather than just excellent, but unique (therefore lesser known) diplomas. This would be a stronger strategy than to tailor yourself to one very specific scenario.

I have been living in the Lucerne area for the past five months having transferred here from NJ. The company took care of all of the difficult stuff for me, like getting a B permit, temporary accommodation, moving my stuff finding permanent accommodation with a hired consultant and even tax advice.

I also agree that it is a good idea to visit here as much as you can before moving. I went with work a number of times for two/three weeks at a time, and got an idea of how the country works, how the people are etc.

I disagree with a few points that were mentioned: ""Discover how expensive things are, how short the shop hours are, how NOTHING happens on Sunday. Get a few passive aggressive notes. Get screamed at in traffic. Experience the social isolation. Live without a decent hamburger available.""

I think that your experience here will largely depend on how much work you want to put into it. The comment that NOTHING happens on Sunday is actually not true. This is the day I have found when the Swiss are most active, going to the beach by the lake, hiking in the mountains in the summer, skiing in the winter etc. It is a much better way to live in my opinion than going to the mall. Social isolation is also not a necessity, I have found that the Swiss can appear sometimes cold on the surface. However when you get to know them they can be quite friendly... it may take a bit of work and a few invites for beers, but the ones I know at least are pretty cool. Also there are tons of expats here to hang out with even if you don't make many Swiss friends.

Another nice thing about Switzerland is that you do not have to sit in traffic.... I have loved it since I got here, riding the train everyday. I don't own a car anymore but rent when I need one (which is almost never). It is cheaper and much less stress.

If pitching a tent is allowed... well, I've been camping in the swiss mountains for years but never found a good resource on where exactly it is allowed and where it isn't. 

Laws themselves are different from Canton to Canton, so it's hard to tell. But there is no switzerland wide ban on camping outside of campsites. According to the SAC leaflet (linked below), it is completely banned in the Canton of Obwalden, but other than that it is fine outside of protection/hunting areas, above the treeline, for a small number of people, for a single night.

Other than that, the only way to really find out if it is allowed at a specific place would be to call the guy in charge of forest/nature protection of the relevant canton and ask them.

Also try to ask farmers or SAC hut managers (if there are any nearby) if there is a place nearby where you can pitch your tent.

Maybe you should read [**that**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_to_roam). The english wiki isn't as detailed as the german one where you can read much more about your rights. 
There it is written that everybody has the right to camp for one or two nights on uncultivated ground. If the spot is near some appartements / buildings then you'll have to ask the ground owner. It further says that you should dig the ground just as much as needed and have to take care that you don't chance the visual appearance of the place where you're camping. Some cantons have different rights about camping but as long you'll stick to some basic rules (don't disturb anyone, don't leave your trash there...) you won't have problems. Have fun.
