Radium decays to lead via a chain of alpha and beta decays [[1]](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a1/Decay_chain%284n%2B2%2C_Uranium_series%29.PNG) [[2]](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4e/Uranium_series.gif). A [piece of paper or a few cm or air is a strong enough radiation shield](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha_decay#Toxicity) to protect you from alpha particles. (This is why I wouldn't worry too much about the 300μSv/h just yet) After the first alpha decay it turns into radon, a radioactive noble gas. This gas also occurs naturally and is [well known to accumulate in houses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radon#Accumulation_in_houses).

[Beta decay is essentially an electron traveling at high speeds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta_decay). A few [meters of air or a few mm of solids/liquids will protect you from beta radiation](http://sciencedemonstrations.fas.harvard.edu/icb/icb.do?keyword=k16940&amp;pageid=icb.page102829&amp;pageContentId=icb.pagecontent270778&amp;state=maximize&amp;view=view.do&amp;viewParam_name=indepth.html#a_icb_pagecontent270778). Alpha and beta decays usually are accompanied by gamma ray emission and this one is unhealthy. The radiation dose decreases at a rate roughly relative to the (distance from radiation source)^2
. (It actually decreases faster due to earth, walls, ... that are in the way of the radiation)

If you live in an afflicted area, measure the radon levels in your house (especially in the basement). Then make sure the drinking water isn't contaminated with radioactive material ([consuming alpha radiators is very unhealthy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radium_Girls)). If none of these is too high, then just remove the radioactive material from the dump, let the media do some fear mongering and get yourself a rent reduction.

Let me give you some contra to the reasons you listed:
 ""school for the adult life"" - This is told quite often. This is absolut bullshit. I don't really know what you are supposed to learn there.. Discipline? You will learn that you know everything better and the guy yelling at you is a complete idiot. And even if you would learn something important there, it will never be worth the months of bullshit you will experience. I even read about a study once, where they compared men, who went to the army with men who did not. The men who were in the army didn't really mature in their service time.
""visit the « raw » country"" - I don't really understand this point I have to admit.  If you want to see the country you should go hiking trough switzerland for a month or so and not visiting a kindergarden, where you will waste your time.
""take pride for beeing in a certain corps"" You will find some friends there. You have to because you are 24/7 together with the same people. You have alot of memories together and went trough pretty bad shit. But you will also meet a lot more asholes, who just want to fuck you over.

And think back to your childhood: Do you have a lot of bad memories? Probably not, we prefer to remember the good stuff. The same is with the military, when old people talk about it. Bad stuff doesn't seem so bad if it is long ago, but good memories last.

If you want to have school for the adult life, go traveling, go somewhere far away you don't know anyone and work there for a few months. You will learn alot more and usefull things, you will have a great time and you learn also something about a new place.
Anything you can learn in the military you can experience somewhere else, better, faster and more efficent. The military is not worth its time

Let me tell you about the contras:
* You will waste a lot of time. 
* You will most likely not learn anything usefull
* You will probably have some of your worst moments in your life 
* You will have to follow stupid senseless orders. You will spend hours and days doing stuff and being inefficent in your tasks because you have your orders.
*  You will run to wait and wait to run.
* While you are in the recruit school you are at least doing something and maybe get a bit fit, the time after that is just a time of boring nonesense, where you do absolutely nothing(or drinking). (depends a bit what you do)
* your social life will be dead. You will come home on the weekend (at least in the RS) go to bed to sleep a few hours, get drunk in the evening, because you need it. Then you will sleep half of Sunday and then you are depressed for the rest of the day

Got way to long, **Summary**: Do not go, because it is a waste of time with a lot of bad experiences. You can learn stuff you are interested in better somewhere else

In Switzerland as a PhD you're not so much a student, but rather an employee. That means you get a salary. How much, you ask.

Right now you might think, ""holy crap that is a fuckton of money"". And in most places in the world you would be right. For Switzerland, I'd consider it (more than) decent pay. A starting engineer would make between 100-120k per year, so for a PhD, it's not too bad.

It's not really a scholarship but an actual employment contract (e.g. you could get fired, but not very common). To simplify it a bit: E.g. you're 60% employee of the university and you will have to do university stuff (e.g. assist in research but also mark exams, admin. stuff and so on). 40% you're a student which sometimes includes PhD classes but mostly it's supposed to be the time spend to write papers. In practice both areas overlap or are sometimes almost the same (especially if you do something applied). However, 100% employment is unusual even if 'being employee' and 'being student' is hard to separate.

[This](http://www.numbeo.com/cost-of-living/city_result.jsp?country=Switzerland&amp;city=Zurich) should help you to get a feeling for Swiss prices and you can compare it to your home country/city.

Pro:

- good friendships, a lot of fun with same/ similar aged people

- extra 3 weeks distance from work helps you to free your mind

- you go on beautiful places where you never ended in civil life (mountains, landscapes)

- free ""holidays"", I always enjoy the extra sleep you get there

- experience no one can take you away. When it's raining or cold winter and you have to spend hours outside, or sleep in just a sleeping bag, or walk 20kms in the summer heat it sucks horribly, but for me as and office employee it's some kind of adventure. And when you look back, it made you stronger and mostly the good memories stay in mind

contra:

- it's a waste of time. Three weeks being away from home, not able to be some kind of productive can hurt. Especially when you're in school and could use the time to learn / have a girlfriend etc.

- military rules are ridiculous, mostly they are far away from any sense. ""it is like it is"" is a sentence which you'll hear often and makes me rage

- hygiene is a problem, you often have less time for take care on this and it stinks horribly, also you have to be comfortable to sleep, shower spend your day with strangers

- it is no life lesson. This talking from the elders is just bullshit. Everythings commanded, you life just along the rules and give away all the responsibility. Everytime I spent weeks in military I come back as a lazy hippie

- some things just suck. Standing in a line for one hour, let some higher miltary people check your outfit or sleeping on horribly cold places, 50 meters away from some warm shelters is just stupid.

true,mobus,null,null,"Just read the other comments, and, if your decision isn't made yet, would like to give you a few arguments ""pro"" army, for the moment I'm leutenant in the army with still 2 month to go before the WK's (splitted my time because of my studies). 

1) you have in front of you the opportunity to ask yourself if the country you live in is just a place that you occupy for a time with no special attachement, or if it is ""your country"", that provides you with security. This security is brought to you by the civilians authorities that, for the moment, think that having an army is necessary to have a safe land. (not speaking about the fact that the army is already useful today, helping the civilians authorities in case of emmergencies, big manifestations, and such stuff that requires lots of mens, materials or knowledge ) (not speaking ether about the fact that the army is the only reason the confederatio helvetica exists today, it was in fact a military alliance in the first place (and for hundreds of years).
This country, your country asks you to do something in return for the prosperity, the welfare, the security it's provides. The people we voted for (the politicians) (and more than 55% of the voting people from switzerland last september) think having an army is useful, necessary, and that the young peoples should serve in this army. I believe It is our right and duty as citizens to go and serve as our authorities told us to (even if as citizens we question the choices that were made).

2) you are 17 years old, maby you allready know what you want to do later in life, if so, just take a few minutes to check what your passions/goals are, and if the army could help you fulfill them : they are great to teach you useful things : driving big trucks, planes, machines,  using specific materials, working with dogs, horses, so on (such formations take often years and lots of money in the civil world). The formation you get for working with mens (if you decide to go up in the hierarchy) is really appreciable, you wont get 60 mens under your command in the age of 20 so easilly (except as a boy scout leader maybe, but that is an other topic). The army can be a place to get that expercience (other places will also teach you that, sadly at great cost and time (between 4000 and 10'000 in the private for a degree in ""group leading"").

3) making friends, experiences, learning to know peoples, cultures, the contry you live in : in the army you will surely get to live your worse experiments in live, it will be hard, you will surely suffer mentally and physically (depends on what you do) and after that you will feel a certain sens of accomplisment (I have done it, it was hard but I'm capable of that: what almost every elderly man talks about), you could get this kind of experience elswere, but, will you seriously do it !??
You will meet great peoples, live incredible things with them, become camarades. 
You will also meet the dumbest people you have ever met, and you will learn to deal with it (dumb chiefs are also present in the civilan world (and dumb people even more I fear). 

4) I would carfully consider the choice of civil service, I already heard of numerous peoples saying they regret a bit choosing this way, because the job offer aren't so easy to find (except of course cleaning the ""oldpeoples houses""). It seams to be difficult to find a real interesting job in your region and going to foreign countries seams to be quite difficult. The amount of time you will have to spend is 1, 1/2 longer than in the army, and I would advise you to be sure to have finished your days before you come on the worksmarket (a company can understand you'r going in the army for WK, but going to clean oldmens butt's during one month is, from what I heard, in certains companies not so appreciated).

5) money, you will get more money in the army than travelling the world (about 40'000.- if you go to lieutenant), you could as well gain more working in a private firm.

Hope this post helped you to fix your mind (or at least see both sides of the mirror), don't worry, whaterver choice you make, you will have the opportunity to have a great life (army, not army, civilian service or not). to all other peoples that think army is not useful, not up to date, not capable of defending us, or simply a waste of money, if you want to discuss the point (arguments after arguments so on) no problem, make an other tread only about this question it's not really the best place to debate, this boy just wanted an advice (I'm a bit busy with exams for now but end of june would be fine ;).

What happens when hit with with high energy particles is (unlike a sunburn) they 'burn' all the way through you. During everyone's life time you are exposed to at least a few really high energy particles that kill off several cells but in most cases your body can repair this. In the case of standing in the collision point, the frequency of this damage is severe. The most intense 'burn' or path would be the two opposing beam directions. Any interaction would likely cause molecular and genetic damage. From here it is a question of how well your body's immune system responds to repair this damage.

finding the spots is easier when you know a few things about Switzerland. We have pretty strict laws for forest protection, therefore forest areas have not likely changed in 50 years. And old buildings have an architecture style unique per region. We had to learn them in school. The rest was just identifying fix points and then triangulating possible locations. Google earth is your friend ;) The one in the Emmental was a lucky punch, I set the view angle in  google earth to south and randomly browsed around for 5-10 minutes and found it.

Since then, we can go to war in a desert, but hopefully we wouldn't be attack here, as our equipment is sub optimal for our climate.",0,1401751197,null,0,false,0,chxlg8p,t3_273sxj,t1_chxlg8p,t1_chx5lsy,null,1434066710,1,false,Switzerland,t5_2qhp6,1

To be honest, I don't know either. Usually a company has to proof that they couldn't find an EU/Swiss employee to be allowed to hire a non-EU/Swiss person but the higher qualified the person the easier to proof this. Either the universities are except from the rule (I think so) or researchers are automatically classified as so specialized that nobody else could do the job. Either way, ETH couldn't be a top university if they wouldn't allow non-Swiss/EU PhD students.

Yes, if you're used to an average student life standard it's actually quite an increase. And compared to PhD programs in most other countries it's very good too. Lot of people in Zurich without a university degree earn that much or even less, so it's not even a low standard. But of course compared to what you could earn in the private industry (especially considering that PhD student were usually very good MSc students) it's rather low.",0,1401752492,null,0,false,0,chxm092,t3_2746ay,t1_chxm092,t1_chxl3dq,null,1434066975,3,false,Switzerland,t5_2qhp6,3
