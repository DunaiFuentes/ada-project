To me it seems like the author is putting both, the green excuse of the Ecopoppers and actual green policies in the same corner, but then describing how different their positions are anyway. And thus kinda making the case for the Green's argument that Ecopop wasn't green in the first place.

There is no real argument why the two parties are put in the same pot, except for both of them calling themselves ""green/eco"". The surprise then is that the conclusion suggests the opposite. The same name seems to be the only reason why, in the author's opinion, both green policies and Ecopop are bad ideas. The same arguments that the Green party used are used to reject Ecopop, but then the Green party is rejected without making any new arguments.  

To me the author seems to preach to the choir of the young FDP/Libertarian group without actually making their own case.

But instead of just leaving this criticism here, let me make my own case, unlike the author does:

Green policies have always been about sustainability. Instead of ""finding the whole of humanity appalling"" green policies are about sustainable growth that allows for a thriving society without leaving bad consequences for other (poorer/younger/yet unborn) people to be dealt with. It accepts this challenge as something hard, but doable and I personally see progress, the economy and technology as important factors in solving this challenge. Stifling growth and progress in general does not solve the problem.

During the Ecopop campaign we realized that the leader of Ecopop is dreaming about a Switzerland where everybody can build their own little houses on their own little properties (kind of like the American dream), while totally ignoring the fact that city dwellers have a much smaller carbon footprint that people living in his dream world. This goes hand in hand with the Libertarian philosophy of not having to take responsibility for your own neighbor and, in general, for society at large.  
Of course you're ""more free"" if you have your own property with your own house, but you're also causing more costs when it comes to providing the infrastructure you'll be relying on either way. Of course we can also start providing for ourselves: We could all be farmers and grow and breed our food ourselves. Heat our houses ourselves with wood we found in the forest next to our properties. That would mean even more space and resources every single one of us would need. But admittedly, it would also mean that you are more independent and free of other people.

I don't know how far the freedom loving people want to take this, but at some point you have to realize that the technology and many resources we use in everyday life today are the products of a functional society. This is why I don't understand this negativity towards society. Our lifestyle is literally the direct product of a contributing society and its cost is that we have to give up some of our independence.

In the end we probably all agree that extremes aren't working out either way and thus I reject the suggestion that any green policy has to be rejected and unfettered economical growth is the way to go.",0,1417681806,null,0,false,0,cmkst0t,t3_2o87je,t1_cmkst0t,t3_2o87je,null,1425614515,7,false,Switzerland,t5_2qhp6,7

false,immerc,null,null,"Definitely.  Specialisation requires you to be dependent on others and they depend on you.  That forms a community of people who support each-other (even if they don't necessarily realise it).

In some ways these interdependencies make things more brittle because a truck driver's strike over issues that you have no control over might affect the food you can buy at the supermarket.  Or a choice that a group of farmers make over the crops they choose to plant can affect what you eat without you even knowing.

On the other hand, it's also a support structure.  If you're farming only your tiny plot of land, and it has a bad year because of drought or pests, you don't starve.  If one modern farmer's land has a bad year, it might really hurt his income, but there are enough other farms spread out that it won't affect the entire community's food supply.  Oversupply thanks to production efficiencies also allows for a social safety net so that farmer isn't ruined either.

Luckily, the modern world allows you to make some choices.  If you want to be more independent, you can get a plot of land, grow some of your own food, put up solar panels to generate your own electricity, and so on.  But not everyone wants to make that choice, and it's a mistake to think that those who choose to live in a city are living a less environmentally friendly life as a result.
