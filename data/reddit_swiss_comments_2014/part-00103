My personal favorite is Philipp Löpfe (an economics sector editor). You can pretty much tell that it takes him 1-2 days to read The Economist and rip off an article. He does that very consistently also with other English Newspaper (e.g. FT). And often he doesn't even name them as a source or quotes them out of context (e.g. Economist has a pro/contra article on banking regulation, Löpfe only quotes a pro regulation argument and write something like ""even the ultra neoliberal Economist wants to nationalise all the banks"", which is clearly not what they wrote).

My girlfriend and I are both remote workers. Of the nine days that we are in Glarus we will work for four, leaving five for exploring. We can work from anywhere, and Glarus came up randomly. 

A few weeks ago we were in Emmental where we went on a beautiful hike up to 1200 meter, with only a tidly bit of snow. Afterwards we went to Andermatt. Above 1500 meter it is a completely different story. Skiing galore!

We are not afraid of a bit of snow (careful though). I guess we are hoping for good sunny weather, making even the dullest valley walk beautiful.

They used two examples for ""investigative journalism"" when they announced the pay wall: SECO and Mörgeli, a minor (but admittedly entertaining) scandal about some regional politician. That's the best they can do? Quite telling...

And their economics/business section is just terrible. Actually they announced that Lukas Hässig (the insideparadeplatz.ch guy) was hired to ""increase the quality""?! So it's clearly going to get worse. All they do is rich people and banker bashing 24/7. Everyone with an undergrad in Business/Economics can tell that the writers of theses articles have absolutely no clue of what they are writing about (maybe except for the people that work for Finanz &amp; Wirtschaft / run the NMTM Blog) but that doesn't matter because it's about distributing a political opinion, not news.

They take articles from news agencies, add a misleading title and a few sentences of political opinion / populism and call it journalism. Also, I met these people when I had to organise PR events for a tech company. They are all very eager to get the free lunch in the fancy hotel and spending their time surfing the web during the event instead of working. At the end, almost all of them just copy the PR texts and add few lines of big company bashing to make it look a bit more critical so that they don't come across a completely buyable. But they all received brand new mobile phones for ""testing"" and 2/3 apparently ""forgot"" to return it (and obviously the company wouldn't ask them to return it, so the deal is de facto ""a nice lunch and a mobile phone for a PR article""). Ironically, in most of the financial companies they always criticizes such corruption would be clearly banned... speaking of moral double standards...

But again, to be fair, Weltwoche and BaZ are mainly concerned with foreigners bashing so they aren't any better, just a different political position.
