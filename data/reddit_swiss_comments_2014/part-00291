&gt;Wie sehr sind Sie an Politik interessiert?

&gt;...

&gt;Falls Ja, mit welchem Alter hat das Interesse ca. eingesetzt?

(that wasn't a yes/no question. How about ""Sind Sie an Politik interessiert?"" - ""Ja, sehr"", ""Ja, etwas"", ..., ""Nein, nicht sehr"", ""Nein, gar nicht."". then the ""if yes"" part would make sense.)


&gt; Finden Sie politische Werbung eher hilfreich oder eher unangebracht?

Only 2 options --&gt; make it into a radiobutton. If you want additional information, add another question that asks exactly that.

&gt;Glauben Sie, dass Sie sich von politischer Werbung eher nicht oder eher schon beeinflussen lassen?

(answer is yes or no. ""Hey do you want chocolate or vanilla ice cream?"" - ""yes."" Wat.)

&gt;Haben Sie für die ""..."" gestimmt?

yes or no question, but there's a text area.


&gt;Sollte die Unterschriftenhürde für Intitiativen und Referenda erhöht werden?
Finden Sie dass zu viele Initiativen vor das Stimmvolk kommen?


Which question do you want to ask? Isn't it possible that one agrees with the first question but not with the other? Or the other way around?

Getting a good job in Switzerland is even hard when you already speak the language, so I can only assume that getting one when you don't speak German is even harder.

The thing that you should be doing is sending the following things:

* Application letter or Bewerbungsschreiben

**Basically write a [letter](https://www.manpower.ch/fileadmin/user_upload/documents/Candidats/CV_lettres/Brief_Elektroinstallateur_DE.pdf) that corresponds to the job that you are applying to. Writing a letter in a way that it feels like it's been ""mass produced"" will lower your chances, so keep writing a new one for every job you find. Tell them that you are willingly to work for one week for FREE in order to show that you are capable.**

* A CV or Lebenslauf with a nice photograph

**Should look like [this](https://www.manpower.ch/fileadmin/user_upload/documents/Candidats/CV_lettres/2014/DE_CV_TEC.pdf), but you can create one freely as long as it contains the relevant info.**

* Recommendation letters or Arbeitszeugnis

**Ok, this is the MOST IMPORTANT thing in a CV according to many companies. A recommendation letter in Switzerland describes how you work and what your competences and what you did in your former company. Ask your employers in Portugal to write you some of these letters in English, tell them to write that you were an excellent worker and so on. Ou podes falsificar como muito pessoal faz.**

* Diplomas

**Currently the working market in Switzerland relies extremely on these diplomas, they want diplomas for every stupid shit that you can do. Can clean a toilet? Get a toilet cleaning diploma from some Weiterbildung school in Switzerland... Ok, I'm joking but they really want to see those diplomas. HRM in Switzerland are basically groups of people that only know what you can do based on your paperwork, not on your actual skills. So they usually just throw away any CV that doesn't appease them even if you have tons of skills but are missing diplomas.**

Don't send with email unless the job is actually far away, if it's near your house go there personally and give them the job application.

Yeah, that's basically it. You can easily find a job that doesn't require skills at all, if you really want you can ask Hotels, Restaurants or even construction companies if they are looking for someone. Warehouses usually look for tons of unqualified people as well.
