Rest assured that skateboarding isn't associated with Americans or being annoying. Well, maybe by an Appenzell dairy farmer or two, but not by the broad public. In fact, skating's having another popularity wave here right now.

&gt;Does the academic record matter a lot?

Here's some insight into the selection process for you, from a former technical student, and recently technical student supervisor (I've seen both sides of the application process within the last 3 years):

First qualification: you must be of a nationality which is entered into the TS programme.

Second qualification: you meet the minimum requirements (are a student of at least 18 calendar months), and do not exceed the maximum requirements (are not a PhD student - with various exceptions and addenda). If you're studying an undergrad degree for 18 calendar months, you pass.

Third qualification: a project supervisor likes your application.

So, after the first two qualifications (which you meet), you are put into the pool of applicants. From there, HR has little to do with your selection. Project supervisors (and there are a lot at the TS level) filter applicants based on their checkbox interests (selected in the application process), and from there try to identify specialities that match their project. 

This selection by supervisors depends entirely on the supervisor's discretion. One of my friends, for example, was told by his supervisor that he searched for the word ""python"" and was selected on that basis. Another friend was selected because he mentioned Perl. Another because she was studying a business-oriented degree. My supervisor selected me because I had some barely relevant programming experience (Java experience, when I ended up using a C/C++ like language), but appeared quite social. 

My (UK) university friends and I each applied because we wanted to do our ""year in industry"" as part of our optional sandwich degree. 

**N.B.**, If you want to apply, then do. The only thing to remember on the application, is BE HONEST! If you have no experience in Perl, don't mention it, because you may end up doing nothing else! Perl and Python are very popular here for the physicists' custom applications. Control systems run in a customized C++ like language. If you know FPGA, or other hardware-level design, that'll be a big hit for the engineering department.

Also, don't be afraid. When you are taken for a student contract at CERN, you are expected to be a student - to learn whilst on the job. Don't freak out if you are doing something you're not confident in...that's why you're there!

All of this shows that wild camping can require a lot of specific research to be within the rules.

Google is your friend to find information, there are lots of articles about the subject with specific information. Most of it is in German, though, locally this will be the same. You'll find signs explaining what is permitted or forbidden, but all in German.

---

&gt;

&gt;The freedom to roam is guaranteed in [Switzerland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switzerland) by the [Swiss Civil Code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swiss_Civil_Code). Some [cantons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cantons_of_switzerland) however have more detailed regulations concerning the rights of access of otherwise not authorised people.

&gt;The Swiss Civil Code provides that forest and pasture are accessible freely for everyone, as long as there is no excessive usage. Except in special cases like the protection of young forest or [biotopes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biotope) it is not allowed to fence in forest areas. This also applies to private property. However, it is possible to make activities with excessive usage and possible potential to cause damage (e.g. events in the woods, access with cars) dependent on special authorisation. Similar regulations are in place for land which is not usable (e.g. stretches of water, rock, snow and ice), regardless of the land being unowned (i.e. being under the control of the canton and not able to be claimed as private property) or being in private hands.

&gt;It is further possible for the canton to restrict the freedom to roam to protect nature (e.g. the gathering of mushrooms, berries, wood, etc. in forests).

Overall, what does it teach you?

- Belair (where the stores are)
- Cathedral St Pierre and its diggin site underneath. (You can visit the tower too)
- Old part of Carouge (saturdays morning you have some nice ""marché"" there with ethnical foods and a nice ice cream place called Manu (or Gelatomania, cant remember which one))
- Le Jet d'eau
- Le Salève (even tho is in the french side, you can take the cable cabin to the top and have a nice view of GE)
- You can rent a bike (for free i think) and pedal through the city. GE is mostly flat.
- You can take a boat and take a tour to Montreux
- Nyon is a nice little place to visit, just 25 km away. There is also an amazing ice cream place there. :). I use to go and rent a small pedalboat and do some dives in the middle of the lake with good weather.
- if you like, there is the Knie Circus in Plainpalais now. It is like the 'official' Swiss Cirque. Not my cup of tea. :/

- You might consider to visit Yvoire (in the other side of the lake, french side)
