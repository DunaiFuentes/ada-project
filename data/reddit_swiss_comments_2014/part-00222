You definitely made a point here and I agree. However, I don't think that this reflects their ideology. Take the UBS bailout: Of course the FDP would never agree to systematically bailout insolvent companies, however in a ""too big too fail"" situation, caused by political pressure abroad and insufficient competition in the market (which could have been prevented by adequate policy) they will make compromises to clean the mess up. 

When it comes to legislation I think the FDP does a (comparably) good job in preventing such situations, if however the government messes up, they are still willing to make compromises in individual cases to mitigate the damage. When one fails to establish an order where ""too big too fail"" scenarios don't happen, one probably has to bite the bullet and bail them out, even tough it generally conflicts with the long term strategy. I don't see this as an inconsistency but as being very careful about ones own ideology. Even as a liberal you probably shouldn't say ""we never bail out private companies"" if you managed to make your economy dependent on one big company alone. What you would say is ""we must make sure that we're able to let any private company go bankrupt"". You have to make sure the necessary conditions for your ideology to work are present before you embrace it to the fullest: You wouldn't want to let the only hospital in the country going bankrupt just because you're a liberal when the actual problem is that there's only one hospital.

I'm pretty sure I could do the same with tax breaks, if I knew a concrete example.

&gt;Liberal has lost a lot of it's meaning. Democrats in the US are called liberal today. That's why there's a distinction between classic liberalism and what we call liberalism today.

I can see the benefits of helping a company is too big to fail but in the end it can happen again and again. But I don't think they should have done it. Of course there's gonna be some chaos but in the long run I think not helping banks would have been the better thing to do. But as I said I can understand the position most FDP politicians had.

&gt; Even as a liberal you probably shouldn't say ""we never bail out private companies"" if you managed to make your economy dependent on one big company alone. 

The problem in my opinion is that too much regulation in the finicial sector supports the monopoly the big banks have. You can't create Bitcoin atms without a licence given to you by the government. Less regulation in the finance sector would lead to more innovation and smaller companies and overall in a more diverse market.

&gt; You wouldn't want to let the only hospital in the country going bankrupt just because you're a liberal when the actual problem is that there's only one hospital.

I'm not sure. I think sometimes there needs to be some chaos for people to actually realize that there's a problem. As a liberal I wouldn't support regulation which means that a monopoly is unlikely to happen (or atleast that's what liberal economic theory says, which I believe to be true). I mean sure a bailout is the better thing to do momentarily but people have to realize that these monopolies/too big to fail companies shouldn't exist in the first place and I think if you bailout companies people don't really realize that. Or they don't take the right conclusions from these sort of situations.

I fully agree and I believe most FDP politicians would too. So no real discrepancies when we strip away the momentarily issues.

&gt;&gt; You wouldn't want to let the only hospital in the country going bankrupt just because you're a liberal when the actual problem is that there's only one hospital.

There's another aspect to the hospital story I chose. Only one central hospital usually means that it is a state monopoly and politicians would be responsible for failure or success. One could also argue that politicians are equally responsible for such an outcome if their regulations leads to such a monopoly (e.g. in the finance sector). It's not like they just bailed out a company that messed up on its own. Considering all the regulations in the finance sector politicians are also responsible for the bad outcome. As a politician you can't just ignore your contributions to the disaster ans say ""Oh, we've a no-bailout policy, sorry crashing the finance sector, let's build a new one instead of fixing it."". As a liberal you must also ask the question ""Given that I already regulated an economic sector, to what extent am I responsible for its performance and does this weaken the usual non-interference principles?"". It's not what you usually ask as a libertarian since you focus on not regulating in the first place but that's not the world we (currently) live in.

&gt;I'm not sure. I think sometimes there needs to be some chaos for people to actually realize that there's a problem.

Or they don't take the right conclusions from these sort of situations.

Altough this is an interesting idea, it's not a liberal or libertarian position (please correct me if I'm wrong). Do these ideologies even imply anything about this issue? To me this seems more like a (unfortunate) historic fact than a principle one should embrace. I agree that this is a huge problem. I would even say that this 'public ignorance' is becoming a threat to democracy itself, but I wouldn't frame it as a question of being liberal or not. Therefore I would expect a liberal/libertarian party to have a clear opinion on this.

&gt; Well I would love to just say 'liberal' but as long as people attribute that to parties supporting regulation and a welfare state I'll stay with 'classic liberalism' or 'libertarian'.

That's what makes being a politician and libertarian/liberal so hard. You're not in favor of regulations but you have to accept that regulations can lead to bad situations and the state has to step in again even though you never supported the regulation in the first place.

Liberalism doesn't discuss bailouts because without lots of regulations you wouldn't have these situations in the first place (according to the economic theory behind liberalism).
