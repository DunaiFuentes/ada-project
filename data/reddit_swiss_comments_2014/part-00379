On a train, everyone loves window sits.


Imagine a car with 2 sits on one side and 1 seat on the other. The numbering would be:


w 1 3 (c) 5 w

w 2 4 (c) 6 w


Here, when two people travel together, they can have consecutive sit numbers AND have the same position (window or aisle): (1,2) or (5,6) or (3,4).


So as a passenger, traveling with your partner, when you get your ticket you see sits 5 and 6 and you know you are together and you are both on a window sit. Groups of 3 also sit together: 1,2,3 and 4,5,6.


Now let's add a set of sits:


w 1 3 (c) 7 5 w

w 2 8 (c) 4 6 w


The logic here goes for the groups of 3 people: 1,2,3 and 4,5,6 are for groups of 3. Two sit on windows and one sits on isle. 7 and 8 are for individual passengers. ",0,1418722152,null,0,false,0,cmwf4y4,t3_2pet7y,t1_cmwf4y4,t1_cmw41lo,null,1425374947,4,false,Switzerland,t5_2qhp6,4
