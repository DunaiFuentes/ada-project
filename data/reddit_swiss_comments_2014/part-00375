Unless I was lied to by the shipping company and customs this is actually not true. They told me several times not to put stuff inside of the car or it would not even get loaded onto the boat because it wouldn't pass customs in Europe.

false,knpee,null,null,"Sorry for the slow reply. The company I used was I Luv Moving (http://www.yelp.com/biz/i-love-international-moving-los-angeles-3). Here is what I can tell you about them...

Before we signed with them they were super responsive and helpful. One of the guys came by our apartment to look at everything we were going to ship and give us a firm estimate. The nice thing is that you will not pay more than the estimate even if it ends up costs the movers more to ship it (unless you add more boxes after the estimate of course). They were also flexible in price... I got a cheaper quite from a shittier company, and I luv moving ended up matching it when I mentioned it.

The estimated delivery time was 7 weeks, which turned out to be pretty accurate. The quote they gave us was for door to door service. That means we just had to put the lose items into boxes, and then professional movers came in and packed and loaded all the furniture, etc. They also picked up the car at my apartment and drove it to the port of long beach themselves. On the Swiss side everything was delivered directly to my new apartment. Unloading was also included in the price, but there were two stipulations. They had to be able to park the truck within 50m of the entrance, and they would only carry furniture up two flights of stairs. If your apartment is higher up you'll probably pay extra. Finally, the quote also includes 30 days of free storage at the origin port if thats something you need. The storage was very handy because in our case we did not have an apartment in Switzerland lined up, and we did not want the stuff to show up without anywhere to pit it.

They were also supposed to handle all of the customs legwork, which didn't turn out that way (but was still pretty easy). The US moving company sub contracts the various parts of the delivery to other companies. That means someone like Schumacher Logistics (one of the largest in Europe, I think) will truck your belongings from whatever European port your stuff arrives at to Basel, where it will go through customs. This was really the worst part of the experience because there was apparently no clear communication between I Luv Moving and the local delivery company. The delivery company had me fill out the Swiss customs forms again (which was very easy) and harassed me about their payment a few times. If that happens to you just tell them to talk to the US shipping company if you have an all inclusive deal with them. This part really was't so bad, but it just resulted in a lot of back and fort phone calls and some additional paperwork. Once all the papers were in order, clearing customs was no problem at all.

As far as the car goes, you should be aware that no Swiss insurance company will insure it until you have passed inspection and have Swiss plates. If you can convince your US auto insurance to add a specialty insurance that gives you coverage you can drive your car with the US plates in Switzerland for up to one year (as long as your US registration is valid the entire time). The crappy thing about the inspection is that many cantons have a fairly substantial backlog, and you can't schedule an appointment until you have a ""Stammnummer"" for your car. And you don't get that number until the car clears Swiss customs. So that means that your car could be sitting in your driveway for a month without you being able to drive it.

The moving company did not give me any indication of what was required for inspection in Switzerland. They specifically said that all they do is move the stuff and handle customs. Making sure the car is legal to import into Switzerland was my responsibility. With that having been said, if you know what Kanton you are going to I would just call up the Strasenverkersamt and ask them if you have questions. Especially if you are in a smaller Kanton this should not be an issue. If you want to make this process easier you may want to contact the manufacturer of your car, or the Swiss general importer of the brand, and ask them for a European manufacturer shield. If you get one of those it should list all specs of your car, which will simplify the inspection process. In my case I had no such shield, so the inspection place sent me a list of the data they needed, and I sent them pictures of the various tags on the car that were relevant. Not sure if that works everywhere (again, I moved to a small Canton, so they probably have more time on their hands), but the guy at the Strasenverkersamt was very knoledable and knew immediately that the California Emissions data I sent him complied with EU norms.",0,1418375798,null,0,false,0,cmsowyy,t3_2owo3f,t1_cmsowyy,t1_cmrmggi,null,1425471599,2,false,Switzerland,t5_2qhp6,2

Edit: There you go. I've made this recipe many times, it's pretty much fool-proof. 

Ingredients:

* 250 g butter (at room temperature)
* 4 eggs
* 250 g sugar
* 1 pinch of salt
* Zest of one lemon
* 1-2 tablespoons of lemon juice
* 500 g white all-purpose flour

Preparation:

1. Mix the butter until it is homogenous. Add sugar, salt and eggs and continue mixing. Add lemon zest and juice.
2. Gradually add the flour through a sieve while continuing to mix.
3. Cover and let sit in the fridge for two hours.
4. Form the dough into hazelnut-size balls.
5. Heat your iron, add the dough balls (one per bricelet) and bake. You'll have a bit of a learning curve until you figure out the exact time, it's usually between 45 and 90 seconds depending on how dark you like them.
6. Let cool and keep in an air-tight container.

Variants: 

* Use orange or lime zest/juice instead of lemon
* Add a little vanilla extract and/or a dash of kirsch, Grand Marnier or limoncello
* Add a little cinnamon
* Come up with your own variant",0,1418395031,null,0,1418407960,0,cmstktb,t3_2p1ztm,t1_cmstktb,t3_2p1ztm,null,1425469423,10,false,Switzerland,t5_2qhp6,10
