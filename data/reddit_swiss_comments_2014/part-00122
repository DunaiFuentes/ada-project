No, because it's not the state's job to guarantee that you as a ""Hausarzt"" can always operate. If you fuck up your business, that's your fault.

No, because 4000.- is too much. There's no way most companies are able to pay that much where I live. 4000.- Is what one gets by doing a 4year long apprenticeship in IT. How are you going to pay 4000.- to the guys who didn't finish an apprenticeship? Also It's against the whole idea of free market (and minimal state regulated) capitalism.

Well, I really believe you voted no for the wrong reason. Back in the late '80 (I think it was in 1989), the army tested the F/A-18A, but and got the F/A-18C ten years later. There is no reason to test an aircraft but not be willing to get the upgraded version when it is delivered *10 years* later. In fact, you never get the very same aircraft you tested, but always a better version of it.

Beside this, the pre-production Gripen E are being constructed at this time (you need about 2 years to build one), and all major new systems have been tested already on a flying test bed.

true,someotherswissguy,ne,Neuchâtel,"&gt; What would switzerland do if Saab wasn't able to produce the Gripen? It's not like we have the power to destroy them. It would be an image damage for them, but they would still have part of the money and we would still walk away without a jet...

Switzerland got a rock solid contract with the Swedish state. We're not even dealing with Saab directly. In the worst case, if the delivered aircraft don't meet the specification, the army could simply send them back to Sweden and get all of the money back.

true,pseudoRndNbr,null,null,"&gt; Well, I really believe you voted no for the wrong reason. Back in the late '80 (I think it was in 1989), the army tested the F/A-18A, but and got the F/A-18C ten years later. There is no reason to test an aircraft but not be willing to get the upgraded version when it is delivered 10 years later. In fact, you never get the very same aircraft you tested, but always a better version of it.

Yes, that's why I think we should get the F/A-18E because the F/A 18 is a better jet overall.

There's no right or wrong reason to vote yes or no for something. It's just a yes or no, nothing more nothing less. Everything else would be subjective interpretation.


&gt; Beside this, the pre-production Gripen E are being constructed at this time (you need about 2 years to build one), and all major new systems have been tested already on a flying test bed. Saab has also a record of delivering what they promise, when they promise it and at the cost they promised, and this unlike many other competitors.

Sounds promising, let's hope they can keep there record of delivering what they promise
