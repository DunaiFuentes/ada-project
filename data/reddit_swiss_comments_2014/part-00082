true,whitepalms85,null,null,"Background

Switzerland has a long history of being neutral, independent, passive and peaceful (e.g. the last war was 160 years ago as we did not fight in the world wars). However, there is this cultural conflict between people that see Switzerland as an open place where everyone is welcome and people that want to stay more isolated (maybe except for trade). These conservatives are mainly represented by the Swiss Peoples Party (Schweizerische Volkspartei, SVP), which is a former farmers party that has been transformed to a mainstream right wing populist party by the influential billionaire Christoph Blocher in the early 90s. He's biggest success was wining a referendum in 1992 stopping Switzerland from joining the European Economic Area which de facto became the EU later. Ever since the SVP is campaigning against everything that could bring Switzerland closer to the EU or lead to more foreigners entering Switzerland. They claim that the EU is undemocratic and overly bureaucratic and that joining them is similar to losing our sovereignty.
To compensate for the disadvantages of not being a EU member the Swiss government signed different bilateral contracts with all EU member countries giving us (and all EU citizens) similar rights as full EU members in several areas (the contracts are quite complicated and include economic, political, cultural, legal... issues). The Swiss accepted these contracts in a referendum in 2000 and additional contracts in 2005. The contracts include ""free movement"" rights that allowed EU workers to work and live in Switzerland without a work permit. The Swiss confirmed the expansion of this free movement to additional EU member countries in a 2009 referendum. The contracts are designed in a way that cancelling one contract would lead to the cancellation of all contracts as they are considered to be a bundle and not single agreements. 


Immigration

Switzerland has one of the highest shares of foreigners in Europe (22%) and the second highest net migration rate in Europe (about 1%/year; or 80k in a 8 mio people country). Migration used to be high during booms and low in recessions but due to the economic problem in the EU and the relatively good situation in Switzerland, migration remained high in recent years. However, unemployment remained low (4-5%, ILO standard) but the Swiss are used to even lower rates. Most migrants are relatively well qualified and come to Switzerland to work in ""good jobs"" e.g. for international companies. This is especially true for Germans that were one of the biggest migrant groups in the last years. Recently there were some reports about more low skilled migrants from Southern Europe coming to Switzerland, Portuguese are a big migrant group too.
There was a very long debate about pro/contras of migration because of the referendum. The arguments included reasonable points (e.g. the cost and planning of infrastructure for additional people in a small country, benefits of more labour for companies, benefits from bilateral contracts...), more simplistic points (e.g. ""they take our jobs"", ""foreigner increase the rents"", ""we don't have enough space""...) and straight populism (""Muslims want to destroy Switzerland"", ""take away our culture""...).
The Swiss show an odd behaviour towards foreigner. There are a lot of foreigners living here and you hardly see anyone being openly racist. However, the Swiss are very proud and nationalistic and differentiate even among themselves (e.g. people from Basel don't like people from Zurich). Being Swiss is like being member in a private club that is hard to join. Even though the SVP isn't openly racist they are clearly targeting closet racists and there are quite a few here even though is a bit of a taboo topic. However, the SVP campaigned relatively moderate this time as they knew that they needed additional votes outside their followers (they have 27%) and there were a lot of more reasonable topics to talk about such as job losses, rents, traffic jam…, all apparently caused by foreigners. Also there is a big cultural difference between the cities where most foreigners and more open-minded Swiss live compared to the countryside where the SVP has its stronghold. 


SVP initiative ""against mass immigration""

In Switzerland everyone that can collect 100k signatures can trigger a referendum on whatever they propose, it’s called an “initiative”. The SVP initiative “against mass immigration” is relatively simple: 1. Within 3 years the Swiss government has to introduce some kind of quota system that regulates all migration (EU and all others). 2. The government is banned from signing contracts that aren’t in line with this. 3. Companies can only hire foreigner if no suitable Swiss workers are available.
All other mayor parties, the government and all mayor business organisations opposed the initiative but the Swiss people accepted it by 50.3%. 
The main reason why most other parties opposed the initiative is that it violates the bilateral contracts with the EU. Most of them consider the contracts to be vital for our economy and fear negative consequences. The situation is complex and the SVP doesn’t fully deny this but basically they claim that the government should renegotiate the bilateral contracts with the EU to get a special ruling for migration. The EU strongly opposes this as they see free movement as a core pillar of their system and point out that the Swiss already have more special agreements than anyone else due to the bilateral contracts and that the Swiss can’t just get all the benefits of the contracts but be exempt from whatever they dislike. However, it’s unlikely that either the EU or Switzerland will cancel the contracts as this would cause economics troubles for both sides (e.g. the economy in Southern Germany is closely interlinked to the Swiss). But it seems that the EU is taking certain measures such as excluding Switzerland from further EU research grants harming Swiss universities. 
Considering that the SVP always opposed the bilateral contracts and that they might get cancelled, the SVP considers this to be one of their biggest victories since 1992. That said, the SVP is closely linked to businesses and openly admitted that they want companies still be able to hire foreign specialists and intentionally didn’t define exact quota in their initiative (theoretically the government could set the quota to an absurd high amount making the quota redundant).
Basically Switzerland has now entered a poker game with the (much stronger) EU hoping either for some compromise that enables face saving for everyone or that the EU will change their migration rule anyway as other countries such as England ask for changes too. However, the EU is scared of the populist right wing movements in Europe and not very open towards such changes.


What it is really about?

There was a loud outcry when the initiative passed and soul-searching in Switzerland has just started. The society looks much split now between people that are more and more hostile toward openness, globalisation and free markets as they feel that they have lost out in the last years. Whereas a lot of people in urban areas feel offend by the initiative as they have a lot of foreign friend and their jobs and lifes depend on an open society. A lot of Swiss apologised to foreigners for the “other part of Switzerland” which again caused outrage by the conservatives. There are no clear cut lines but there are pattern such as cities vs. countryside, German-/Italian-speaker (voted yes) vs. French speakers, young, educated (voted no) vs. old, no university degree… and so on. At the end this is probably not so much about migration or the other (more or less) rational argument but about a changing society in which a lot of people are against change.",0,1395586328,null,0,false,0,cg9rkdu,t3_211335,t1_cg9rkdu,t3_211335,null,1433031347,25,false,Switzerland,t5_2qhp6,25
