&gt;

&gt;__Panix Pass__ or __Panixer Pass__ ([Romansh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romansh_language): *Pass dil Veptga*, German: *Panixerpass*) (el. 2404 m.) is a [Swiss](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switzerland) [Alpine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swiss_Alps) pass between the cantons of [Glarus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canton_of_Glarus) and [Graubünden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graub%C3%BCnden).

&gt;The pass was an important trade route from the canton of [Glarus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glarus_(canton\)) to [Italy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy). It connects [Elm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elm,_Switzerland) in the [Sernftal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sernftal) in Glarus with [Pigniu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pigniu) (Panix) in the [Vorderrhein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vorderrhein) valley of Graubünden. It is not passable for automobile traffic.

&gt;In October of 1799, Russian General [Alexander Suvorov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Suvorov) [made a strategic retreat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suvorov%27s_Italian_and_Swiss_expedition) from the [French Revolutionary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Revolution) forces south over the pass and regrouped his forces in [Austria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austria).

Other activites ranging from eating, watching tv, talking to people etc are obviously fine. 

About the bar scene - it depends what you are looking for. There are tons of bars where you can sit down and have a drink, with varying ambiance and opening hours. If you want to shake dat ass you are limited to very few options such as the A2 (not very spectacular and a bit further out), the Pickwick's (way too cramped though), the Nordstern (hello drugs!) or the Balz Bar (I've only been twice and have nothing to nitpick apart from the occasional hipster invasion). There are others, but in general (and despite what I just said) there aren't that many great options in Basel unless you have a group of friends (then everything is great) or connections to the illegal party scene (which are fun until right before the police show up). Most clubs will be open until 3-5 am, some even longer. 

Public transport is great. At night during the weekend there are special night courses called the ""TNW Nachtnetz"". Usually they only depart once per hour though, so you may want to inform yourself and write down your time so you don't miss it and don't have to party for another hour (the horror!).
