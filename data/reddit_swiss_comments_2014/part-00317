Let's assume you mean that by the result of 3 years of the both ways migration the growth should not exceed 0.2% or 16000.

Okay. A thought experiment.

Let's assume the rate of immigration to emigration is 2:1, twice as many people want to get in. [See](http://www.bfs.admin.ch/bfs/portal/en/index/themen/01/07/blank/key/02/01.html).

Year 0. Starting point. Everything zeroed.
Year 1. 50K new permits are optimistically issued because we have two years to catch up. 25K permits were ""closed"". Balance: population: +25K, from them 9K hanging permits.
Year 2. 10K new permits issued because it was too much last year. 5K people left. Year's balance: +30K. Overquote: 14K.
Year 3. Which hunt. No permits issued because by the end of the year 14K people **must** leave the country no matter what. We've already reduced in-flow so cannot really expect that much people to voluntary leave. We need to make sure we fit the quote. Being humanistic, we start with single people, then expel whole families. Quote reached. Next year we can issue 50K permits again.

This is too risky.
Safe way would be following.
Year 1. Issue 33% of the quote. 5333 permits.
Year 2. Issue another 33% plus as much as left during last year.
Year 3. Issue last 33% plus again whatever became available.

Which totals to **very roughly** maybe 8K permits a year.

I don't think you get the point (neither do most Swiss people).

The baby boomer had less children than their parents that's why there are more old people than young people. Furthermore, the life expectancy increase. If the birth rate had stayed the same, we wouldn't have an issue. The irony is that the whole 50+ generation kind of is the problem (not the foreigners) and instead of allowing it to be solved by foreigners, they basically force the young Swiss people to pay for them so that they can retire early in a pure Switzerland without a high population while the young people have to work their asses off to pay for the old peoples luxury life.
