You don't need to be well-known to have a Ph.D Thesis or a master one or have written some programs or being a lawyer, an architect, etc. So, there are more people that you pretend in that situation.

I would agree on that if they didn't recently modified the law making ""keeping your own name"" subject to a fee, which is small, but still, IMO, in line of principle wrong.
