false,Syndic,so,Solothurn,"That's your argument for how moderate or lack thereof Muslims in Switzerland are? A chart of the whole world? You seriously try to deviate the level of moderation in Switzerland by using global numbers? From 1.6 billion to 400k? Come on, that has to be the one of the biggest generalization I've ever heard.

Level of moderation varies a lot between different countries (as you'd see on the survey you rely on), the more westernized the more moderate. So those numbers don't represent Swiss Muslims in the slightest. But hey, let's pick the numbers which at first glance support your point the most, right?

And on the first two topics: I really don't want to know how many Christians in Switzerland think that they are superior to women and would agree to Christian laws. I'm sure there are more than you'd think.",0,1419580950,null,0,1419586182,0,cn5n4df,t3_2q2f7y,t1_cn5n4df,t1_cn4ya38,null,1425212352,1,false,Switzerland,t5_2qhp6,1

On the contrary, it would confine them into their house with no more contact to our culture.

But at least you can tell to yourself that you've done something against those scary Muslims, right? You even think that this would shut down Islam. Do you imagine that those nutjobs who actually force their women to wear such a thing would see your point and get less conservative?
