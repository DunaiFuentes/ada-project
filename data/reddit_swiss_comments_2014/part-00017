Thanks alot for the explanation, this clears things up a bit but at the same time raises more questions.

&gt; Beginning yesterday, we had seen some congestion on upstream networks in Paris (https://twitter.com/CloudFlareSys/status/423903478872698880[4] ) which resulted in slowness to all domains using CloudFlare that were accessed through Paris. This congestion should now be clear.

We (UPC Cablecom customers from switzerland) have had the slowness issues to i.imgur.com for almost 2 months now, and not just yesterday - as you can see from the other thread. Should we keep monitoring the situation and raise a ticket with Cloudflare again if the problem persists?

No to the immigration initiative. This is not even remotely a solution for the problem and it causes so many other problems that you can't even consider it a pacebo. I have an economic background and following discussions on this subject is truly rage-inducing. It's also a very shitty campaign (fearmongering galore) and deserves a slap in the face just for that. 

I haven't decided if I'm in favour or against FABI. I like our rail infrastructure and agree that it needs to be improved, on the other hand you can't keep taxing the motorized traffic without giving it anything in return (especially the Gubrist area and Zurich-Bern desperately needs to be improved). I agree that too many people are commuting and the best way to adress this issue is by increasing the cost of mobility, but the biggest commuting target is Zurich which couldn't hold all those commuters anyway (and its already expensive housing prices would climb even more) which means people would have to settle for the surroundings - so they are still commuting. I will have to follow the discussion on this some more before I make a decision. 

As a resident of Basel-Stadt I also get to vote on the ""Frauenquote"", that is that every executive of a company closely affiliated with the canton needs to be at least 1/3 female (and 1/3 male). I will be against this because quotas in general are proven to reduce quality and I think it's the worst thing for a businesswoman who worked hard to be considered a ""quota"".

They are not real numbers for you either, actually. Real numbers mean, that you understand 1 and 0 (or yes and no) as elements among other numbers as 3, -2.31, pi, e and you can add, subtract, multiply and divide with them. In this world, division with 0 does not make ""sense"" as it would lead to weird stuff.

In the programming world, you don't understand 0 and 1 as real numbers, though. A bit-shift or a bitwise-or is defined for 1, but it's not defined for a number like pi; you can't even represent pi properly. So you are using not real numbers; you use numbers that look, on the surface, similar to the real numbers, but there are caveats (like 0.1 \* 7 - 0.7 != 0). So you already use a different understanding of numbers when you think as a programmer.

Now that we have established that there are more than one meaning of 0 and 1 (one as real numbers, one as, for instance a float, one as an integer - which all behave differently), we can define our own meaning of 0 and 1.

I now define, just as you did, no=0, yes=1 but with a little twist. In my world, the / operation behaves just like subtraction:  
1 / SVP(no) = 1 / 0 = 1(yes)  
1 / SVP(yes) = 1 / 1 = 0(no)  

You might ask why this does make sense; well... we often denote the inverse an element x with respect to some operation by 1/x or x^-1 . You know already the example of multiplication with a real number. You take 4 and multply it by an element: 4\*3 = 12. And now you do the inverse of that: 12 \* 1/3 = 4. So you're back where you started.
If you did CS, you might know of matrices: A\*B = C. And now C\*B^-1 yields A.
Now we can think of 1/yes as the inverse of yes - in this case no. And vice versa 1/no yields yes.

[Math stuff]: On the other hand, I'd like to say that this will not yield a group. There are two *basic* notations for groups; additive and multiplicative and the above definition does not make sense in either (0 does not exist for \* and / is the inverse in the \*-notation). This does not mean, though, that we can't define the / operation as our group operation.
