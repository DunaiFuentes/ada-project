In 2014, Switzerland has 33436 thousand ounces of gold. An ounce is worth 1150$. (value =~ 38'451'400'000).

I disagree; the history of the great depression in North America paints a starkly different story. For example; in 1921, the US had the greatest stock market crash in its history, to this date, as the cycle stemmed from World War I. The length of the business cycle was about 6-9 months, and the government did not have any interventionist policy at the time. During the great depression; you saw a less severe market crash, and what stemmed from this was heavy government involvement. That depression lasted around 15 years, and was an admitted failure by its architects.

A fun fact about gold when price controls were set:

&gt; In 1933, Roosevelt became President and appointed Morgenthau governor of the Federal Farm Board. Morgenthau was nonetheless involved in monetary decisions. Roosevelt adopted the idea of raising the price of gold to inflate the currency and reverse the debilitating deflation of prices. The idea came from Professor George Warren of Cornell University. When Roosevelt told Morgenthau he was thinking of raising the price of gold by 21 cents, his entourage asked him why. ""It's a lucky number"", Roosevelt said. ""Because it's three times seven."" As Morgenthau later wrote, ""If anybody knew how we really set the gold price through a combination of lucky numbers, etc., I think they would be frightened."" [4]

Hypothetically if tomorrow, 1 Swiss franc was worth 1000 euros the Swiss citizens would be able to purchase all types of goods and services from most of the rest of Europe for a fraction of what it costs currently. Imports would surge. Exporters would greatly suffer and so would tourism. So what? If your franc can buy nearly 1000x more today than yesterday you don't need tourism or exports; you would essentially be sustaining yourselves on the backs of the rest of the continent. The rest of Europe would be giving you real goods and services in exchange for pieces of paper. Your standard of living would be fantastic.

What would happen if the opposite would happen? Let's say the franc lost 99% of its value overnight. Exports would increase but Swiss citizens would not be able to buy much from the rest of EU because of the low value of their francs. The Swiss would be working long hours in exchange for Eurodollars. You would have full employment with little time for vacation and a lower standard of living. 

Of course these are extreme examples but they prove a point. In the real world, and without central bank intervention currencies would find their market exchange rate to balance trade.
