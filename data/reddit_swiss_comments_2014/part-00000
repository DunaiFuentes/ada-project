It's quite a tourist attraction. Besides that, near Zurich grows a special kind of tree, the *Rutus Cashusforallus*, on which plentiful money prospers for anyone to pluck. If you're lucky you can pluck a 1000CHF bill but they only grow around christmas time which unfortunately just passed. But you don't need to sing or read anything to pluck things there.
