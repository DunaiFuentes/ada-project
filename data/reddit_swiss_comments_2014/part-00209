So you certainly had a Chasselas wine. On the label the you'll find the place of origin, maybe some fantasy name, the name of the wine maker, etc. There are some known named regions, like Dezaley from between Lausanne and Montreux.

I do have favorite wines and wine-makers from the region, but I drive there, taste it, buy and get home with a boot full of wine :-). There are some good wine-growers in my village too, so I don't have to drive far.

I'm sure there are online wine shops, I don't know them. The problem with wine is that shipping gets expensive fast, so it is not worth it for the Swiss. Also, most wineries are small and used to sell locally. Some do have a deliver organisation or even deliver themselves around the country. Also they tend to speak french only. So shipping wine around internationally is not something they get into easily.

Your best bet is to find a Swiss specialty shop in your area and see if the have some. There are online-shops who internationally too, like http://www.switzerland-wine.com (I have no affiliation and don't know the company).
