St. Gotthard is good if you stay off the motorway until you're at Göschenen and leave it again after you leave the tunnel because it lets you enjoy the drive and the landscape, but that's my opinion.

Furka is really good because you drive up the valley pretty far and the railway tunnel only cuts through the top.
