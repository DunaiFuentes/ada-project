true,Icebein,null,null,"Swiss guy here, let me add some things to this:

- I don't know the Swiss Pass, but I really encourage you going everywhere by public transport. Sometimes a car is faster but often there is a lack of parking spaces or they are expensive. Also pretty much every road here is as small and crowded as downtown San Francisco.

- Migros and Coop are the two biggest supermarket chains in Switzerland. Denner is somewhat the cheaper stepchild of them. In rural areas there are also Landi and Volg. And yes, the opening hours are way shorter here. In urban areas they are open from 8 am to 6 or 8 pm, in rural areas they may make lunchbreaks and close down at 4pm on saturdays. On sunday, nearly everything is closed. Watch out for gasstations, they often have little supermarkets that are open from 6am to 10pm, on sundays from 8am to 9/10pm. And yes, you can get alcohol from there as well.

- The mentioned two-prong plug works, I do have similar ones for my devices I bought in the USA.

- No washcloths and no hand soap in hotels is strange, but again, in rural areas it can be common. Switzerland has a high standard, but sometimes it astonishes me how low the standard in hotels can be.

- Cash is king. Credit cards are not used that often and not for paying small amounts. Your observation is correct, there are almost no change machines. The last one I saw was dismounted some 10 years ago.

- Say please and thanks, be polite. Swiss people are reserved but friendly. If you put a little effort in your conversation they will appreciate it.",0,1405083034,null,0,false,0,ciufefc,t3_2acyo7,t1_ciufefc,t1_citx2fz,null,1434662174,2,false,Switzerland,t5_2qhp6,2

One milliard francs yearly to fund 7 TV channels and a dozen of radio stations. A lot, imo. Maybe somebody's even watching them, I don't know. But also I suspect they show ads.

So what I think rational thing would be:
Use taxes instead of the annoying billag.
Reduce programming to news and social/cultural programmes.
