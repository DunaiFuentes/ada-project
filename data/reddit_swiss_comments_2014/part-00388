The films title is called ""Muggeschiss"", which litterally translates into ""a flies crap"", describing something buggering, but at the same time of absolutely none importance. One can make a drama out of a ""Muggeschiss"", or one could get a whole days workload because of a ""Muggeschiss"".

IMO, the film is about a rather ambivalent trait the swiss have, the desire to be as perfect as possible; always seeking the optimum way to handle things. See our political system, which at it's core are 7 people seeking optimal consensus, or simple things like household helpers like the [Sparschäler](http://www.kitchenfriends.ch/uploads/pics/sparschaeler.jpg) or [Betty Bossy's Ham-Croissant-Portioniser-and-Cutter](http://www.cantadou.ch/webautor-data/7/gipfler-von-Betti-bossy.jpg). Typefonts are also a good example where most perfectionism is required, and where one swiss guy was brilliant. Helvetica (the worlds most seen font probably) or Frutiger are good examples of how most attention to details can lead to a ""perfect"" product for a specific purpose, Helvetica for maximum versatility, Frutiger for maximum readability. Things like that (..or our trains, our watches, our fancy banknotes) make me proud and feel that we swiss are of some importance to the world, although we're so small. We are able to make perfect things.

**BUT: Perfectionism leads to pedantism.**

In order to maintain our self-image and outher-image of beeing (almost) flawless, we try to point out every ""Muggeschiss"" we find, in order to distract from what we don't want to concur with in general, but seemingly refer to a little nuisance, which by beeing corrected, will create a little loophole where we can hide in. There is always a sidestream that flows into the same direction as the mainstream, but it is easier to get out of.
I don't want to brag (how could I ever), but isn't this a perfect strategy for politics, work-relations, and even for friends? ;-)

Conservatives want to maintain the remains of a so called safe and sound world which has been transformed due to WW2, globalization and transnationalism.
