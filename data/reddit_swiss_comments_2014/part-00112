true,Panaetius,zh,Zürich,"Two of my coworkers are muslim (From Afghanistan, one of them got hsi citizenship a couple of months back) in zurich, both of them very liberal. I.e. they don't drink alcohol, don't eat non halal meat, but they don't pray 5 times a day, joke about the hookes living next door like everybody else and no one really cares about their religion. At least I haven't witnessed any occiasion (and they've never mentioned any) where it was an issue.

Basically, don't talk about your faith unless the topic comes up (Swiss generally don't talk about religion too much). If it does come up, more often than not people will be curious and ask you questions and that's it. Just try to not take it too seriously, if at all possible. 

Also, more often than not, people are trying to be tolerant. So if they actually do something to offend your faith or anything, it's often due to ignorance and not malice, so try to shrug it off and not make an issue out of it. Like if someone is offering you a meat plate and you're not sure if it's halal, just politely decline and they'll usually leave it at that after declining once or twice (second time for ""Oh but this here isn't pork, so it should be fine, right?""). They won't hold a grudge or judge you for it unless you make it an issue. At least that's how it's been in my experience with my two coworkers.

Basically, as long as you don't make a big deal out of your religion, other people wont either, at least in public (some might think differently about you once they know, but there's nothing you can do about that, sadly).

LGBT rights are mostly tolerant, though it depends a little on the canton you're in. For instance same-sex civil unions are different from canton to canton afaik. There's  LGBT clubs and LGBT parades and stuff in most bigger cities.

Again, don't rub it in peoples faces if you're gay. Heck, even my gay friends dislike gays that walk around in pink and ""behave gay"".

French in the french part is fine, there may be slight dialects but nothing that should be any problem. And english is usually enough as well.

I don't think speaking arabic will give you an advantage as a designer. Getting a job as a designer isn't easier or harder than most other jobs afaik, but it depends on what you do. In recent years there's a lot of people doing design stuff as a hobby (let's be honest, every kid with Photoshop installed is a designer nowadays), so you have to be good to be hired. As for art, there's art scenes on most bigger cities, but there's kind of a divide in my experience. There's lots of artists that do it more as a hobby and aren't too successful. They'll have exhibits in galleries and stuff like that, but usually they have to pay for them themselves and the people just go there to look at it and they'll rarely buy anything, if at all. And then there's the big artists, the ones that get asked to exhibit somewhere and actually get paid for their art, and those are far and few between. People are supportive and they'll tell you how beautiful your paitings are and so on, but if you tell them that this particular painting costs 300 bucks, they'll be like ""ooohh, I'll have to think about that"" and that's the last you see of them. At least that's how it is for the 4 relatives of mine that do art and exhibits and so on. Or in other words, everyone loves art but no one will pay for. Then again, I think that's the case for most artists.

But as far as art is concerned, being arabian might help with the ""foreign"" aspect, to get people interested.

I don't know of too many art events (at least not in zurich), usually it's lots of smaller events throughout the year (think exhibit in a gallery with maybe 20-50 people). But there's cultural events, like concerts, film festivals, stuff like that.

About animal shelters, maybe [this](http://adopt-a-pet.ch/sites/tierheime.html) might help you get started.

On a side note, a lot of swiss are kinda stuck up. So if they're bothered by something you do, more often than not, they'll not mention it and just talk badly about it behind your back, while being all smiles and giggles when talking to you. It sucks, but oh well. If you think this is happening, it's usually best to just ask them if somethings bothering them (in a polite manner, not like ""whatcha looking at, eh?"") and you can usually clear it up. This is more for the workplace, friends and so on, no way can you please every random person on the streets :) But still, always try to be polite and considerate of others and it'll get you a long way with swiss people. And when I say stuck up, I mean it. Small stuff like talking loudly on your mobile phone, or not saying thank you when you get your food at a restaurant and so on. Not trying to scare you or anything, and it is a minor issue, but still, if they're people you'll be spending some time with (like work buddies), you might as well try to not let stuff like this become an issue.",0,1398014734,null,0,false,0,cgxeu3m,t3_23i8fg,t1_cgxeu3m,t3_23i8fg,null,1433441159,15,false,Switzerland,t5_2qhp6,15

A lot of art. Check out the Kunstmuseum in Zürich.
Jean Tinguely in Basel. Fondation Beyeler in Basel. Fondation Pierre Gianadda in Martigny. Paul Klee museum in Bern. Just to name a few.
A lot of big artists come to Zurich (Hallenstadion) or Basel (There's an arena there) and to Geneva as well. However we have a lot of small things going on that are worth checking out. Especially in Zurich.

LGBT rights: Probably easiest in Zurich. Pretty much nobody cares. The French part seems more judgmental to me (source: lived in Fribourg for 10 years and am a lesbian). The innermost part of Switzerland where there's nothing but cows, farms and mountains aren't known for their tolerance either. But overall I've never had any problems travelling around with my partner. There are a lot of LGBT clubs in Zurich. (I currently live in Zurich, so it's what I know best)

Language: Standard French is enough. Most people here know basic English or even know English pretty well. My partner is British and so far never had a problem getting around. If you are in the German part of Switzerland French won't help you though, you're better off with English and should start learning German. If you're in the French part. Basic French and English will get you through. Italian is the least used of the 3. Plus most Italian speaking people know some or even good French.

Religion: I've never encountered a problem with muslims. Again Zurich is very tolerant. The French part is very tolerant. However, the country at the moment seems to drop more and more into the right wing corner. But overall foreigners are perceived as a bigger problem than muslims. 

Jobs: You need a permit to work in Switzerland. So not that easy. Once you've got a job permit however, with English and Arabic as languages, plus basic French you shouldn't encounter too many problems. They either won't care or it'll be an advantage. 

Animals: There's a lot of shelters that are always in need of people to help them walk the dogs, etc. So you will have plenty of choices.

You're more likely to have issues with being a stranger (not necessarily a foreigner, being from another part of Switzerland could do it too) than being gay.

Standard French is fine, they don't really have dialects the way they do for Swiss German.

Being gay probably goes a long way to defying stereotypes, but also you probably shouldn't follow the Quran much. You don't have to read too far into The Cow to see where Islamist terrorists got their ideas. If you're really liberal you probably won't have much trouble, but any indication of fundamentalism and strong adherence to scripture will give people around you (justified) concern.

As for being a Muslim, I am also veiled, and i understand what you mean that if I am not an asshole about my religion then I should be fine (and I am not not an asshole, I promise!)

Thank you for allowing me to ask more questions! Be ready for the flood :P

* I heard all shops close early and on weekends, does that apply for restaurants too? Are there no 24/h mini-markets or anything?

* How important is it to have a car there? Or can I rely completely on public transport?

* How is the geek culture? Any comic-cons or the likes?

* Uhm, what are the Switzerland policies regarding drugs? I am only talking weed here, nothing dangerous :P

* What's a certain swiss meal that may not be very famous but is a must-try once I'm there?

* Where I am from it's pretty common to have an full time maid living with you, even for middle-class people. Is it the same in Switzerland? Or do they have part-time maids? Or is everyone expected to do their own home chores? *shivers*

* All the comments are about how rigid the swiss are. Can you tell me what do they do for fun :D ?

* What is the most famous swiss Movie/TV series? I would like to at least know that and not be so ignorant!

I think these questions should be enough for now (I'm sorry &gt;.&lt;) Thank you so much for everything!

Gas station shops tend to be open 24 hours or at least until late and also major rail stations (Geneva, Lausanne, Bern, Zurich, Basel) will have shops that are open until late (8PM very late for us Swiss) and on Sundays. The airport also will have shops open on Sundays and later during the week. Otherwise be prepared to find that all shops Friday evening and Saturday throughout the day are swarmed with people who seem to buy food for a whole week.

Car: Depends on where you live. We have such great public transport. It will get you anywhere. However if you live in a small village and need a bus to get you home it's quite possible it will only be once an hour after 6 PM and the last one will be before 11PM. Which means then a car might be required. However if you live in the city, then the car is unnecessary.
We have a car sharing service called Mobility. You become a member and then can get a car at nearly any rail station and other places for a small fee. It works out very cheap if you only need a car a couple times a month. https://www.mobility.ch/en/private-customers/

Geek culture. There's some manga and anime things happening. Rarely. We have a few comic shops. But also rare ones. I haven't heard of a comic-con happening yet. I'd say we aren't that geeky. But who knows, maybe I am in the wrong place.

Drugs: Uhm. Ha! Weed. A lot of people smoke weed. And the police almost never interfere. It's silently tolerated. It is however illegal so just because it's usually silently tolerated doesn't mean that you can't get into trouble if the police officer has a bad day. Selling however is not at all tolerated. So make sure you don't get caught selling anything ever.

Fondue. Raclette. Züri Gschnätzlets (veal cubes with a mushroom sauce, quite famous dish in Zurich). Rösti (a potato dish). A lot of cantons have their own sweet desserts (like Bern has gingerbread with hazelnut etc.). Cheese obviously. Our cheese counters are ridiculous. Älplermagronen (a kind of pasta).

Maids: NOPE! Do your own home chores ;) We do have cleaners who you can hire and they come in once a week for a few hours. However, maids are a thing purely for the upper class and by that I mean the unreachable upper class. 

Fun: Sports. Seriously, we're quite outdoorsy. Hiking in the mountains (such beautiful places). We have some weird sports: Schwingen (farmers wearing leather shorts, throwing each other onto their backs, whoever stands last, kind of like Sumo wrestling, just the people weigh less). Swimming in lakes and rivers in the summer. 

TV: Pingu (claymated penguin for kids) - uhm, it's the only thing I can come up with haha! We do not have a lot of TV Films going on. Some sitcoms and soap operas have been made. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Swiss_films As you can see not a lot is on here in general.

It's actually great that you told me that it's hard to make friends there, I might have been disheartened and thought there is something wrong with me if time passed by and I didn't really make many friends since I am a very social person. But if that's the way they are then I shall be respectful and try to be the best of me I can be and hopefully end up with great loyal Swiss friends!

It's interesting that there are some xenophobic &amp; anti-islam messages. But I understand that, some people give Islam/foreigners  a bad name and you can't blame people for fearing what they don't know and only see the bad part of.

 I will make sure I respect their hesitation and maybe I will be one of the people who give Islam/foreigners a good name!

true,Panaetius,zh,Zürich,"By veiled, do you mean wearing a hijab or a burqa?

Because a burqa would definitely be a problem. It's not something you see that often around here and it comes with a lot of negative opinions for swiss people.

The hijab shares some of the same issues, but to a lesser degree. 

I mean, it's is a pretty noticable feature that distinguishes yourself and swiss people are kind of xenophobic. Usually not in a bad way but more in a ""being cautious with what you don't know"" kinda way. Which wouldn't be a big deal if we weren't kinda private as well and coupled with this (like, asking a random stranger questions about themselves is considered impolite), well... I think you can see how that could make things difficult.

As for stereotypes, there's no stuff like ""All black people eat only chicken and watermelons"", but the stereotypes are more along the lines of preconceived notions. Like, a veil is seen by a lot of swiss as a symbol of oppression of women by men, so if they see a women wearing a veil, they will see them as victims of a sort and the notion that some muslim women chose to be veiled because they like it, or for traditional reasons and so on doesn't even enter their heads or at best seems absurd to them. And even if you tell them that no, you don't get beaten with a stick at home, some swiss will have a hard time believing you or still remaing sceptical and suspect an ulterior (and more sinister) motive.

I'm a little exaggerating here, but that is along the lines of what goes through a lot of swiss people's head when they are confronted with someone wearing a veil. And, well, it is a stereotype and generalizations are rarely a good idea, but there are cases where it's actually true and if those get public, you will read about them in newspapers, so it's not something completely unfounded. And stereotypes with a sliver of thruth to them are harder to overcome than completely unfounded/idiotic ones. I mean, basically it's a stereotype of concern for you, so I'd try to not be offended and take it for what it is.

Another stereotype is that muslim women tend to marry muslim men (I have no idea how true or false that is), so swiss guys probably won't hit on you when you wear a veil. I'll leave it up to you if that a good or a bad thing, I guess it can go either way.

So it might make it harder for swiss people to approach you, as always, more so in the countryside than in big cities. And since first impression always matter, it will make a difference to how people approach you. Especially in the older generations. 

But well... its difficult. Asking other people personal question being considered inpolite, combined with the fact that talking about your religion without being asked about it being ""bad manners"" too, combined preconveived notions... I think you see my point.

Historically, equality betwen men and women in switzerland has been... well, complicated. We were pretty late to grant women equality (and we're still not 100% there, like unequal wages and so on). Women fought hard to get the right to vote, which was introduced in 1971 on the federal level, but the last canton to follow suit was Appenzell in 1989 (against the will of their male population), so that's about 50 years after Germany and the USA did it. On the other hand, we were one of the first countries to do so by popular vote, with 65% of the population being for it ([See this](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Frauenstimmrecht_1971_de.svg), Appenzell is the dark red canton) if you're interested in the vote results), we have had several female presidents so far. What I'm trying to tell you is that, given this history, and since a lot of the women who fought for those rights are still alive, coupled with the ""Veils are signs of oppression"" stereotype, might lead some of the older generation of women to be extra skeptical of it and see it as a step backwards (ironically enough...).

I guess the best way to deal with that (And this really is just a guess, I don't have any female muslim friends to draw experience from, at least not since I've been 9. Maybe that'll change in the future :)) is to just be yourself and if your veil does come up as a discussion topic, take it with humour instead of making excuses or anything. Just show people that you're an independent woman and that they don't have to worry about you and it should be fine.

As for designers, most designers and artists I know are very liberal, and have more feminist tendencies than the general population, so being veiled might be more of a challenge around that crowd. Then again, if you wear a colorful hijab or something it might give you bonus points for being progressive? I couldn't say, just my guess.

On the plus side, as a woman you shouldn't have to worry about the ""Muslim people are terrorists"" stereotype, though that shouldn't be too common anyways.

Lately there's also been a lot of discussion in europe about muslims not integrating well with our culture (If you ever read /r/worldnews , you'll know what I mean..), with britain being one of the more prominent examples, but the general sentiment going around in most of europe (the right wing party in switzerland recently succuessfully pushed for a limitation of immigration, there's was a unconstitutional ban on minarets and so on). So this is definitely something to look out for as well. No one cares that you're from a different culture and that you do things differently where you're from, feel free to do them here as well (as long as they're not illegal/amoral to us), but if there's some swiss thing, give it a try and go along with it. Try our food, go out for drinks with your coworkers (even if you don't drink), check out some uniquely swiss event. Visit the mountains and enjoy the landscape. But from the sounds of it I don't think you'll have any problem with that :)

I hope this helped. 

TL;DR: People will approach you differently if you're veiled but if you're open and confident about it, it shouldn't be too big of a problem.",0,1398082306,null,0,false,0,cgy164z,t3_23i8fg,t1_cgy164z,t1_cgxzb05,null,1433451879,3,false,Switzerland,t5_2qhp6,3

I am not much of a sports person, but I think living in a very hot country may have contributed to that. I'm sure when I move and see the amazing scenery in Switzerland I will be more active! (or maybe just stay home because it's so cold.. I can't even imagine seeing the snow for the first time!)

true,Formagella,ti,Ticino,"being more outgoing than average will probably be good for you though, because when people see a veiled woman they might associate it with being conservative and think of stuff like avoiding all physical contact with men and all that jazz so they might restrain themselves, like if they're talking to a nun. 

So you have to show what your social boundaries are with action or people will stay even more reserved than if you were just another stranger because e.g. they have no idea about what they can joke about without offending you. Being bubbly will break the ice much faster (if we're talking about young people and not 50 years old co-workers of course). 

Taking the initiative means that you also risk crossing lines too early but I don't know anyone that would hold a grudge about it, just don't ask private stuff in the beginning or put people on the spot. 

Don't be discouraged by cold response (as long as it's not because they're offended). ",0,1398084295,null,0,1398084526,0,cgy1n56,t3_23i8fg,t1_cgy1n56,t1_cgxzfgy,null,1433452102,1,false,Switzerland,t5_2qhp6,1

true,Formagella,ti,Ticino,"there is much more wage equality so nobody normal can afford even a part-time maid. It's something for the superrich. 
A millionaire might be a millionaire just because they own their own home in a place where prices went up or own a family business, so don't be fooled by the statistics, these people might very well be unable to pay for a maid unless they make sacrifices. 

Older people with good wages often have a cleaning lady that cleans once a week for a few hours but that's it. If you live alone in a flat just forget about it, you waste less time and stress by just doing it yourself. 

You don't need a car but if you're in a small city, there might be a bus only every 15 or 30 minutes, a train only every 30 minutes, and at night it decreases, with the last bus runs usually between 23 and midnight. So it can become a problem if you like going out at night. It costs a lot to own and park a car though so avoid it for now and think about it only after you've been working a few months.
