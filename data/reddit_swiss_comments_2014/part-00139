However I wouldn't worry about that. You are never required to speak it since Swiss people in Zürich are perfectly fine understanding standard German or English. You also don't really need to understand it, if you don't mind asking people around you to switch.

There is not really a formal study. There are some Swiss German courses, but I think people take those just for fun.

true,Soarele,null,null,"I did an exchange with D-ITET at ETH during my undergrad and had most of my courses in German. Only one of my professors was actually Swiss and he ended up being easier to understand than some of the others as he tended to speak High German a little slower (to compensate for his accent?). Sometimes a Lehrassistent would begin a tutorial session in Swiss German, but whenever this happened someone in the lecture hall quickly asked them to switch to standard German.

When I was an exchange student I was also permitted a certain number of course hours with UZH's Sprachenzentrum and ended up taking two courses. The first was a pre-semester intensive course (two weeks of ~6-7 hours of German class a day, level determined by an exam on the first day) and another course during the semester called ""Dialektverstehen und Deutsch im Schweizer Alltag."" The course emphasized understanding spoken Swiss German (primarily Zürichdeutsch) and covered things like vowel/consonant shifts from Standard German, common words/phrases, basic grammatical differences, etc. There was not much emphasis on actually speaking dialect, however. 

Overall I'd recommend both courses, but you need to make sure to sign up as early as possible if you plan on taking them, spots fill up really fast. You can also sign up for a tandem partner for language practice (German &lt;&gt; English, Swiss German &lt;&gt; English, any language pair you can come up with).

If you have any other questions about what it was like being an exchange student there or want some materials on learning Swiss German (from the class and elsewhere), just send me a PM and I'd be glad to help.",0,1400290580,null,0,false,0,chk01aa,t3_25pfeb,t1_chk01aa,t3_25pfeb,null,1435493357,3,false,Switzerland,t5_2qhp6,3
