Je n'habite malheureusement plus à Lausanne depuis de nombreuses années, mais pendant ma vie étudiante j'ai travaillé à Zelig, le bar de l'UNIL. J'y ai découvert beaucoup de gens très ouverts et sympathiques! J'y retourne de temps en temps pour rencontrer des anciens amis. Je suis sûr que si tu traines dans le coin, tu joues au babyfoot, bois une bière, tu rencontreras pleins de gens prêt à discuter!

*Congratz on your initative !
Sadly I dont live in Lausanne anymore, but during my student life, I used to work at Zelig, Unil's student bar. There I have discovered many friendly and open-minded people. I go there once in a while to meet old friends. I'm sure that if you hang around there, play a bit of foosball with the locals, have a beer, you will surely meet a lot of people willing to help you!*
