true,birra_80,null,null,"Since Brazil chose Gripen the Swiss no is not a disaster, its not good of course, but the program will continue, thats whats most important from a Swedish perspective.

It might not have been framed as it by the no side, but the referendum was really not so much about buying Gripen or not but rather if Switzerland should have an air force. Without a replacement for the F-5s the F/A-18s will use up flight hours quicker and will be increasingly expensive to maintain and will most likely be at the end of their service life around 2025 (F-5s before that). Since a sovereign nation needs to be able to control its airspace it would not surprise me if Switzerland ended up leasing Gripen C/Ds akin to the Czech republic.

In the long run, the no vote can very well end up being more expensive than a yes. With the no, offset deals that would have gone to Swiss companies may end up in Brazil and i would guess that the chances of pilatus winning a deal for a future trainer for the Swedish air force is not increased. If Switzerland decides that it needs new fighters, Gripen is probably still the best choice, but no longer being a launching customer leaves Switzerland in a worse bargaining position.

But then again, most of the people that work low level jobs in Switzerland, and therefore do not have nearly that much money saved up, are either natives or commute from Italy or France, and I got the impression that they'd love to move to Switzerland if they could afford to.
