true,curryfication,null,null,"I recently moved to Zürich from Germany, so I might be able to answer a few of your questions.

Taxes: You'll have to pay the [Quellensteuer/witholding tax](http://www.steueramt.zh.ch/internet/finanzdirektion/ksta/en/spezialsteuern/quellensteuer.html) from your salary. Normally this will be deducted from your monthly pay and you don't have to do anything, since your employer will normally handle this. The amount you have to pay depends on things like marrital status and if you pay church taxes etc. so I can not really tell you how much it will be in the end. For me its about 8%.

Health insurance: You are required to get a health insurance within the first few months of your stay. A cheap one will be about 350 CHF per month. However, if you have a portuguese health insurance you can apply for an exception. I think you might have to meet other criteria for this though, such as short term stay (under 3 years) and/or a job in academia.

Parking: I don't have a car, but I was given the choice of renting a parking spot with my appartment, since there is an underground parking garage that belongs to the appartment complex. It would have been another 150CHF a month on top of my monthly rent. Otherwise there are white and blue parking zones in the city. For the blue ones you can park for free for an hour (...I think...), for this you have to get a [Parkscheibe](http://www.kc-werbeartikel.com/bilder/produkte/gross/Parkscheibe-Eiskratzer-Duo.jpg) and place it in your window (to show the time you arrived at the parking spot. As a local resident you can also pay to get a card that lets you park in the blue zones (more than just an hour). For the white zones you have to pay during the day (there will be a parking meter nearby) and after 7pm you can park for free. For the city itself I would not recommend going anywhere by car anyway. There are a lot of Trams and buses you can use (although I have to tell you public transportation is quite expensive in this country).

Car: For a short term visit it is okay to have a foreign license plate, but since you will apply for an Aufenthaltsbewilligung I don't think you can keep using it. Since I don't have a car I can't help you more with this point.

Rent: Here, it highly depends where exactly you want to live. I have an apartment which is a little bit farther outside of the city which costs me roughly 1000 CHF. I also know a few people who live in nearby cities such as Baden and commute to Zürich (for Baden this would be about 15min to mainstation).

Electricity/Water: I have some sort of automatic payment thingy for my ewz bills, so I actually don't know what that totals up to. I'd guess its around 40CHF per month, but I might be wrong here.

Internet: I pay about 300CHF a year just for my cablecom port and another 80CHF monthly for internet. On top of that you will have to pay the radio license fee (Billag). This will be around 200CHF per year (depends if you have just a radio or also a tv or both).

Food: I eat lunch at the cafeteria at my workplace, which is subsidized, so it costs only around 10CHF. Of the top of my head I'd say I probably spend another 300CHF on groceries a month, but I live with my boyfriend, so this might be less for a single household.

Get some Zweifel crisps (Paprika ones are awesome), make sure to buy some Ramseier apple juice and if you are into cheese you'll have the opportunity to buy some decent cheese (they sell 2012 L'Étivaz at some MMM Migros at the moment). Cailler and Villars chocolate are probably a good buy since I don't believe you can find any outside of the country.

**Tours &amp; touristic activities**:

Make sur to visit the International Olympic Committee Museum as Lausanne is its ""home"", it's in Ouchy and I heard a lot of great things about it. You can also board a steamer and take a trip on Lac Léman, since you have a pass this should be sufficient.

If you have to withdraw currencies from your bank account, I suggest you do it in America directly or try to see if any bank can help you with your request (BCV, UBS, etc..). The exchange rate is roughly $1 for 1 CHF I believe.

Weather is nice although we had a few thunderstorms lately. You should be fine with summer clothing, I'd suggest you bring a jacket just in case.",0,1404484800,null,0,1404485003,0,cioezr6,t3_29sxv1,t1_cioezr6,t3_29sxv1,null,1435481390,1,false,Switzerland,t5_2qhp6,1
