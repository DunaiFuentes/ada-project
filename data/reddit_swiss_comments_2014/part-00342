I'm not sure if this is necessarily down your alley, but I worked at Tissot (you probably know them) in a small town called Le Locle in the mountains of Neuchatel. Easily one of the best, if not the best experience of my student life. I stayed in a hotel for a week and got up each day to walk to the headquarters up the mountain which took about 15 minutes. The people there are EXTREMELY nice (very attractive female employees if you're into that haha (especially at the international sales floor). I loved being independent and after ""work"" taking a quick train ride to La Chaux de Fonds for a drink or something. I would order pizzas to the room, and my (hot) coworkers even invited me to eat with them. At the end of the stay with them they gave me gifts and stuff.
