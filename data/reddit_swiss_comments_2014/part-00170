true,unicornsworshipme,zh,Zürich,"Stop shopping around. There is a fixed price for Swiss Pass (like for all tickets in Switzerland), so you won't find different prices at different resellers / websites. So [this is all you need](http://www.swisstravelsystem.com/en/home/tickets-en/ticket-overview.html).

Swiss Pass is a pretty decent deal. CHF 552 is not cheap (that's the price for 22 travel days), but just to get from Zurich to Lausanne is CHF 71. And this is for two hours on the train. 

You might want look at Swiss Flexi Pass. With Swiss Pass you can travel every day, with Swiss Flexi Pass just a certain amount of days. So if you just plan to visit a couple of cities/towns this might be the better option. But it only makes sense if you travel far. E.g. a day trip from Lausanne to Montreux and back only costs CHF 24.80, so if you use the Swiss Flexi Pass for that you just waste money.

What I would do: If you already know what you want to visit in Switzerland go to [sbb.ch](http://www.sbb.ch/en/home.html), use the timetable and the ""buy"" button to calculate the total costs of your trip. Maybe you will find out that the Swiss Half Fare Card (CHF 120 for one month) is the best deal anyway.

Some other tipps:

* Swiss train prices are fixed. So Zurich – Lausanne is always CHF 71 on any train, and it doesn't matter if you buy the ticket one month in advance or like two minutes before the train leaves.
* Just buy 2nd class tickets. 1st class is a little more comfortable but it's hardly worth it. Really. 
* sbb.ch not only shows you train connections, but also buses, ships, montain railways... the whole public transport system actually. So make sure to also get the app when you travel in Switzerland. It's basically on every Swiss smartphone, too.
* If you have any questions/problems when travelling in Switzerland just send a tweet to @RailService.

Generally, the southern part of the old city is very scenic and a lot of the tourist attractions are there, such as the Abbey. There is also a cable car there that travels up to St.Georgen (a quarter / borough of St.Gallen) and the ""Drei Weiheren"", a recreational area where many locals hang out during the summer. The cable car is currently in revision but I think it should be fixed by July. 

However, the walk up to St.Georgen leads through a ravine that is actually very interesting, many mills were in operation during the industrial period, powered by water, and the path has some nice urban decay and there is a somewhat eerie ambiance to the place. Of course if the cable car is operational you can take it the way up and then choose to go by foot on your way down. Might be easier :)

The ""Drei Weiheren"" provide a nice view over the city and you can see as far as Lake Constance and Germany. There are a couple of artificial ponds up there that date back to the industrial age there where you can go for a swim if you're not afraid of 'nature' (these are natural swimming pools, so no chlorine water). If the weather is good the place will be absolutely packed. If you're adventurous and the weather is good, buy some sausages and meat, then hike the 1km or so from the Drei Weiheren up to the top of the ""Freudenberg"" (a hill). There is a public fireplace and chances are very high that someone will already be bbq-ing up there, so join in and make some friends! And it's absolutely glorious when the weather is good. You'll be able to see the Säntis.

If you have some more time I recommend taking the train to the canton of Appenzell and do some hiking there. There are some breathtaking views to be found. For instance: http://www.myswitzerland.com/en-ch/interests/hiking1/hiking-and-aescher-cliff-restaurant.html

&gt;

&gt;__Fathers' Day__ is a celebration honoring [fathers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Father) and celebrating fatherhood, paternal bonds, and the influence of fathers in society. Many countries celebrate it on the third Sunday of June, though it is also celebrated widely on other days by many other countries. Fathers' Day was created to complement [Mothers' Day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mothers%27_Day), a celebration that honors [mothers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mother) and motherhood.

No, this is not the Swiss way of doing things. We compromise and find solutions that are mutually satisfying. Here, this means the freedom of posting and commenting in any national language. While /r/t0t0zenerd went against that, so do you by suggesting we should ""adjust"" to the Germanic majority.

&gt; I count the swiss-french to the french too when it comes to behavior

After suggesting that the French ""shit on EVERYONE else"", this is clearly insulting and disrespectful.

&gt; yes, I do think too we should all write in english on reddit.

Extending the same logic, should we do this in our country too? Let's ban all cultural nuances and dialects and simply standardize everything and everyone?
