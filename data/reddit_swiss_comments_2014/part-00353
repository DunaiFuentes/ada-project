IMO the problem is that the SNB just sold huge amount of gold between  2000 and 2004. From the article:

&gt;The SNB officially went on to sell 1,300 tonnes of Swiss gold between 2000 and 2004 as a part of the gold price supression program.

The initiative comes down to one question: What do you want on your assets to be backed with? If you don't trust the value of the Euro, the current policies are risky. Shifting the weight over to something more stable would be great, the question is if gold is more stable or not. However that ignores the ramifications of what happens to our export industries when we're no longer pegged to the Euro.

If we don't have to buy gold, we have to sell Euros. If the EU is going to recover and thrive in a couple of years everybody will hate on the SNB because they sold Euros when the price was low, if the EU is going to crash again and more and maybe even split up (and more chaos that we cannot predict) we'll be going down with them with the current policy. I'm not sure gold would help us then anyway. The initiative is again written with an isolationist's mind. To become more independent from the EU and its economy, we would first have to find other trade partners. Then we wouldn't care us much about the value of the Euro. Then we wouldn't need pegging and also nobody would care about gold.

One last point about selling gold: I'm okay with it. Their task is to give us price stability and when trading with gold achieves that, so what? I don't like that we have to tell them that a fifth of their backing has to be gold.

Tragic Turn of the Gold War

In the nineties, the gold war entered what may be its last and most tragic phase. Gold-rich Switzerland became the main target. War preparations are often made a long time before actual hostilities begin. The groundwork was laid many years ago when it was suggested that neutral Switzerland join more international organizations. The battle for Swizerland’s gold opened when the country became a member of the IMF in 1992. A few years later, in 1996, the SNB radically changed its gold policy.

Late in 1996, the Swiss government, in co-operation with the SNB, came to the surprising conclusion that, in today’s world, a 40% reserve backing of its currency was no longer necessary.

For decades the SNB had been considered as solid as the rock of Gibraltar. Not that its record was impeccable, to the contrary, it blundered repeatedly. But, it had in its coffers 2,590 tonnes of gold representing the golden guarantee. It was the fourth largest gold reserve in the world, equivalent to 8% of total official gold, or almost as large as the reserve of Germany, a country 10 times larger than Switzerland. The Swiss National Bank decides to give up its independence because of its own blunders

Things were going to change. In the early 1990s, the Swiss economy was not doing well, and unemployment was uncharacteristically high. The SNB knew that the most expeditious tool to weaken the franc was to drop the golden link, i.e., to reduce monetary discipline. The golden link had to be eliminated anyway because Switzerland had surrendered to the rules of the IMF by becoming a member. Chronology of the swiss monetary drama

1992

Switzerland joins the Bretton Woods Institutions

”All Warfare is based on deception” – Sun Tzu (China, 500 BC)

”The Swiss National Bank has no intention of selling any gold” – SNB Board member, June 20, 1992

The end of the Swiss Franc’s historic tie to gold was brought about in 1992, and not in 1996 or 1999. The decision was taken when Switzerland joined the IMF. According to IMF articles of agreement adherence to a gold-backed currency was prohibited, and Switzerland fell to its knees under the leadership of its Federal Councilors EU-favorer Flavio Cotti and the social democrat Otto Stich. The only ones who did not know what was going on were the Swiss people. They were never told the truth.

In recent years the government and its growing bereaucracy built up a powerful PR machine for the purpose of direct intervention. It is now the order of the day that before each plebiscite this opinion-making propaganda machine is deployed, and heavy pressure is put on citizens to follow government proposals. The whole exercise it not only illegal, but it is done at taxpayers cost. This is no longer a democracy.

How could the Swiss be lured into giving up their gold standard? The easiest way was to let them join the IMF, although it pretends to be in favor of strong currencies, explicitly states in its articles of agreement that member are prohibited from tying their currencies to gold. They can tie their currencies to anything else, to Special Draing Rights etc, but not to gold. This is how tha Swiss franc lost its unique status. And that is why Swiss banking will gradually lose its powerful position.

It was a sensational triumph for the manipulators. They had finally achieved what they wanted for so long: the complete abolishment of gold’s monetary role. From there it was only a short step to convince Switzerland to sell its gold, thereby pushing the price of gold further down into the abyss. The Switch was thrown and the manipulators only needed to wait. The gold wars were entering their most decisive phase

I don't really want to forbid people to post their articles that are related to the votes, but it would be great if discussion on certain perspectives could be x-linked either in those main threads or into the side bar.

So for instance all popular posts on Ecopop would get a special mention in the sidebar or the corresponding vote thread.

You can use all trains, trams, buses and ships within the zone with that.
