true,D49A1D852468799CAC08,zh,ZÃ¼rich,"&gt;How much of a language barrier will I face? 

As much as any other foreigner who speaks little French and less German. As a traveller, it won't be a big problem. Living here would be more challenging though. 

&gt; What kind of expenses beyond food and housing should I expect? 

Again, depends on whether you are planning to live or are just coming for a visit. Plan on expensive health insurance if you are coming to live. 

&gt; Is the region friendly to travelers? 

Yes. 

&gt; And how easy is it to get around the country without a car?

Probably the easiest country in the world for getting around without a car. ",0,1396294110,null,0,false,0,cggodod,t3_21sogd,t1_cggodod,t3_21sogd,null,1433150828,1,false,Switzerland,t5_2qhp6,1

Generally good information in this thread so far. Use your Swiss passport when you enter Europe. Use your US passport when you enter the US.
