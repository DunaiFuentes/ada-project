what is this left-wing circle-jerk? 

Do you realize that the 60k (1/4 of the workforce) cross-border commuters in Ticino + tens of thousands of independent italian artisans who work temporarily (who pay no VAT btw and many of them are fake independents) are causing massive salary dumping? 
And they keep increasing. At the same time, residents who are without jobs are increasing. 
7.7% of resident foreigners are unemployed, because they get fired first when a low-cost cross-border commuter comes by. 

Traffic wasn't a problem a few years ago, and they said they wouldn't increase, and yet their numbers are exploding. Schengen bans any limitation on the G permits. 

The cost of life is the same as in the other cantons, Ticino is very urbanized, has lots of foreigners and property prices are high, yet because of the Schengen rules we can't put any limit on workers who live in Italy, and so the youth have to compete with people willing to work for 1500 CHF/month, because that's a good wage in Italy. 
Programmers with university degrees get paid as low as 2000 CHF/month. 


Add in the fact that these people all go to work in their cars, 1 person per car, because there is no decent public transport in Italy and they live in the small villages around Varese and Como, a very restrictive geography and you have a traffic problem. 
We're building a new rail to connect the FFS railway to Varese to try and ease the issue and what happened? They're going to be 2 years late or so with it if they don't drop the project completely, all because of italian red tape.
