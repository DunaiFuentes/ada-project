true,Julices_Grant,null,null,"What everybody seems to be forgetting is the language. I'm Swiss but I lived one year in Germany where I made lots of German friends, but mostly because I worked my ass off to understand German and speak it correctly in order not to be a burden.

See, if you can barely speak swiss-german/French, it'll be hard for you to make friends, because let's be honest, I don't want to talk English with my friends.

I remember a few weeks ago I was at a small party and this guy brought his exchange Australian friend along. We were all speaking French and the dude  couldn't speak one word of French. In the end, it was sort of shitty because the guy didn't understand anything and you couldn't expect the whole 10 people to speak English. Some of us made an effort and talked with him for a few minutes but you know, it wasn't the same.

My point is, I don't want to speak English and I don't want to repeat each sentence ten times for you to understand. I don't mind if you do mistakes or ask questions as long as I understand what you mean.

TL;DR: learn the language if you want to make Swiss friends.

Wonder why everyone has Interlaken on the bucket list. Need to figure that out once and for all. Considering the fact, that there are several languages spoken and also considering the fact, that there is a rather mild climate in the southern part you are only hitting the German part of Switzerland.

I read, that this trip is part of some kind of tour. But if I were you I would definitly spend some time in Lugano/Locarno (https://www.google.ch/search?q=valle+vercasca&amp;qscrl=1#q=valle+verzasca&amp;qscrl=1&amp;spell=1) as well nice climate and also for hiking, biking, shopping (e.g. Milan is about 30 Minutes away)
From the French part I'm the wrong guy to ask. But there's Gruyere, Geneva, Lausanne, Montreux, that are rather nice places.
