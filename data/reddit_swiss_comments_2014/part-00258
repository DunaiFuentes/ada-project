Here you might find several possibilities to take a cablecar round trip up a mountain. You won't have any problems finding a typical village and just spontaneously stopping anywhere. As other say, eat a Bündner platte (cold cuts) and capuns. The following day travel to Ticino via the San Bernardino route. Stop first in Bellinzona and see the castles, spend the afternoon in Lugano, shop, and take a walk in town and by the lake.

true,DeepBlueNemesis,bs,Beide Basel,"Being a captain (dt: Hauptmann) is vastly different than being a regular lieutnant. As a captain you have experience organizing a whole company (100+ people) and planning on a greater scale than one afternoon. Even though army organization usually sucks, having experience like that sets you apart. 

And the electronic warfare specialist doesn't have to be a l33t h4x0r. He has experience with hardware, knows his way around computers and various forms of security. This means he needs less training and guidance which is something to consider. For example, being an ABC specialist in Spiez is actually a thing that will help you nail a job in a bio or chem lab. 

These things are not dealmakers though (just like having to do WKs is no dealbreaker) but they are things that you definitely have to put onto your CV because they *will* help you. To use an example from civilian life, if someone puts ""Leiter einer Pfandfindergruppe"" into his CV that tells me that he has experience with organization, that he bore responsibilities in the past and the he may have people skills (dealing with kids and other leaders in meetings). I don't know how deep those skills run but that's what the job interview is for.

So while the army does not have the place it once held in the job industry they may still equip you with useful skills that are of interest for civil employers and you would be naive to outright dismiss it. 

*This message was brought to you by a guy who hates the army and has experience in HR and the job market*


Edit: But (to answer the question in the OP) it is probably not worth going to the army just to learn those skills, you could learn them elsewhere and probably be better off with a similar time investment.

For the ride, you can easily plan your way between the resorts and use the list to pass some climb. They have their big tour, 90km with the lifts.

I have done a few ride there, not lately, but you can easily go to Champéry, take the cable car to Croix de Cullet and start from there. Ask for a good ride in any bike shop, they would hapilly provide you with good tracks. Also you can get a map from here: http://map.geo.admin.ch (http://map.geo.admin.ch/?X=119134.00&amp;Y=552730.00&amp;zoom=5&amp;lang=en&amp;topic=ech&amp;bgLayer=ch.swisstopo.pixelkarte-farbe for the Porte du soleil region).

Or if you want to try other ride, you can go to [Mountainbike land](http://www.mountainbikeland.ch/en/mountainbikeland.html) and choose a few stages/tour they have. On the map there you can see places where you can rent/repair/eat/... But the Portes du Soleil aren't part of this network for the mountainbike, so you can't see their ride there.",0,1409751054,null,0,false,0,ck7z3r9,t3_2fa8js,t1_ck7z3r9,t1_ck7y969,null,1427219545,2,false,Switzerland,t5_2qhp6,2

Honestly, if I need to hire somebody and have the choice between an officer and a basic fusilier of otherwise similar qualifications, take a wild guess who will get the job.
