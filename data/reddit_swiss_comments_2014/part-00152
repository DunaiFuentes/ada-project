true,Euksel,null,null,"&gt;you as consumer should only care about the running costs and should only pay this amount. And in this comparison the train is extremely expensive (plus unflexible and sometimes with Stellwerkstörungen). 

If we only care for ""running costs"", this would not only involve petrol for cars: It would also include insurance, tear and wear on certain parts (such as the occasional repair), the necessity to change tires at least twice a year and more.

To simply say ""ticket price == petrol price"" is highly unfair to the public transport. Cars have lots of ""hidden"" costs that you don't encounter on a daily basis. You won't get very far just with petrol.

Unflexible: I would tend to disagree. While there are certainly issues with the system in some places, if your car breaks down you're going to have more than 15min delay (and on top of that, additional costs). Seen from this point of view, even 30min of delay are actually a miracle when you think what all has to be done in order to *have* a train going.",0,1401402837,null,0,false,0,chudil9,t3_26omhc,t1_chudil9,t1_cht7pnv,null,1434011010,2,false,Switzerland,t5_2qhp6,2
