true,unicornsworshipme,zh,Zürich,"IMO by looking for vegetarian restaurants you might miss something. I mean you can eat vegetables at home, there is no need to travel for that.

I advise you to study Swiss cusine instead. While we tend to eat lots of meat a fair amount of our traditional dishes are vegetarian. You probably know Fondue and Rösti. But also stuff like Raclette, Älplermagrone, Risotto, Flour Soup from Basel, Ribbel, Zwibelechueche, Musli, Älplermagrone, Pizzoccheri and Pizokel come to my mind. Or just grab a nice loaf of good Swiss bread and some cheese and have a picknick. 

Don't fence yourself in. If you just visit vegetarian restaurants you'll encounter food vegetarian restaurants tend to serve. Don't get me wrong, i like Tibits as well. But if you want to experience Switzerland, go out and experience the food as well.

Of course, you sill want to ask the waiter if the Älplermagrone are vegetarian.",0,1406062514,null,0,false,0,cj4tffc,t3_2bc0uw,t1_cj4tffc,t3_2bc0uw,null,1434846957,2,false,Switzerland,t5_2qhp6,2
