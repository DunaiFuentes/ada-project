Already did (on test datacenter): Active directory, domain controller, dhcp boot, file sharing, group policies (mailny for automated mounting of drives), iscsi lun, install and use sql database, server core instance, powershell. And I already destroyed about 5 server instances ;)

Microsoft provides excellent documentation over technet, which helps a lot when you do not want to ask a collegue every 5min.

FYI: you can get MS Server 2012, exchange server, sql server etc for free for evaluation purposes from MS. Install it over hyper v and it even boots at login in the background (helpful if you do not have a spare machine). You can use it for 180 days, and by then, you probably destroyed it anyway ;)
