false,whitepalms85,null,null,"I work in finance and never heard of them. But just by looking at their website and linkedin:

&gt; MWC group 

Maybe I'm being unfair here but having looked through their CV on linkedin I find them a bit odd. They are all British and none of them seems to have worked in Switzerland before MWC. Not that this is necessarily negative but it's still a bit odd that they hire no locals with knowledge of the market here. Also their backgrounds aren't very impressive and sometimes quite weird. They all have a very sales related background and some worked in industries outside finance, some have trading/broker backgrounds. None of them worked in private banking, tax law or something like that before. Again, maybe I'm unfair here but my guess would be that they are going to be very focused on sales. Maybe they are have more an US type broker-client relationship model, where basically your adviser actively trades and invests for you. Maybe it's just expats in Switzerland that had to deal with all the issues of moving here and decided to make a business out of it. They present themselves very adviser like / conservative but the website looks quite cheap with a lot of fluffy language.

&gt; Thun Financial Advisors

I'm a bit confused about them because Thun is a small city in Switzerland but they seem to be based in NY without an office in Switzerland. I think the founder is Swiss and that's probably the connection to Thun. However, their backgrounds looks much more convincing to me. There were all mid-ranked people at banks / big four and have experience in finance, tax and so on. I would rather go with them.

I know financial advisers in Switzerland but they are more focused on Swiss people. However, I would recommend advisers instead of banks to be honest. Maybe [http://www.englishforum.ch/](http://www.englishforum.ch/) is a better place to ask your questions than here as most people here are Swiss and don't know so much about expats matters (especially US tax related things).
