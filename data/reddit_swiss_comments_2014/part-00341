If you want to educate kids on these new technologies you have to train the teachers even more.

This is one of the things where I find Japan has an advantage - bureaucracy is more complicated there, but the way you're treated is completely standardized and so once you're used to it, you know exactly what you get. That's also true for pretty much any kind of service you can get in Japan. It takes getting used to, but employees treating you like an overly polite robot can often be a blessing.

Still, if I want efficiency, I'd usually take the Swiss way, there's just a slight risk of them messing things up and everything becoming slow. I've found that being overly *nice* to them (which is a bit different to just being *polite* if you know what I mean), they tend to treat you better and quicker. Tell them you're sorry that your case is so complicated, for example (which is already a bit unusual, most people are not so quick with saying sorry). Swiss civil servants will often even complain about the system themselves, which can be a fun quick way of reminding them that you're all just sitting in the same boat and try to get by.
