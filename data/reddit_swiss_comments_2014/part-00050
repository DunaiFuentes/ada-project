I absolutely agree here! You named a very important point, that Notter didn't. **signing a referendum**. By reading his words, it came to my mind his idea was different. His idea was to bring it up to the table again, no referendum, nothing. Just go back to the state of February the 8th and start again. This is the only part that I did not like, because it is the only part that tells me, he is not willing to accept any other result than what is in his opinion right.

I think you are right, and I think it should never be done. It could either backfire hard or cause people not to vote any more in the future. Because our system does not work that way. A referendum on that vote needs 100k people signing if coming form the people, that's our system. And that way it was done multiple times. He named one example himself. Womens right to vote. An other one, we have voted several times to change or cancel military service. We could also go forward and propose a vote to change the Swiss system, who ever does that is doing political suicide. :-)

Without the deal it's going to be more complicated for everybody involved to do anything really. It's going to get more difficult for universities to do student exchange and joint research projects, it's going to be more difficult for businesses to get their workers from a diverse pool, it's going to be more difficult for the private citizen to travel and find a job.

Not impossible. Of course not, but more difficult. The bilateral agreements relieved this stress and now it looks like it's coming back.

With the vote earlier this month, we forced the federal council's hand to renegotiate this great deal with *less* to offer than before. The ball is in their court and they have to find a way to get an even better deal coming from a worse position. That actually sounds impossible to me and you can hate on the council as much as you like, but they don't have much of a choice now.

Our best option is being able to sell the argument that the bilateral agreement and the free migration agreement are separate and can be renegotiated individually. Burkhalter is doing that right now. He's doing damage control, trying to explain that the vote *only* wants to change immigration laws and nothing more.

The problem *is* actually that we're a special snowflake because nobody understands our position, there is no precedent for a contract like ours and it's very easy to look like an egotistical cherry-picker.

The EU understands the agreement as one package and if you want to change one thing, everything is on the table. They can't really be faulted for that because all member states got this deal. We want an even more special deal now, than we had before and I don't think we can do that with giving up a lot of things now for free. Why? Because we're in a worse negotiating position than ever.

To the omnipresent horizon 2020 programme aspect: Budget: 80 billions with Switzerland spending 4 billions. Former EU research programmes showed that Switzerland basically get the same amount back that they spended. So if you spend it directly to Swiss research institutes it won't have severe consequences.

His last paragraph is surprisingly reasonable, given the many false assumptions he makes in his article.

In this case, a majority voted for something, unless you believe they were stupid/misinformed/manipulated - because that obviously cannot ever happen to any significant degree to the side that is ""right"".

Istanbul is a great falafel place, a real falafel, and quite inexpensive too. Right in the center near the train station. Its actually a sit down restaurant. 

Dean and David are just around the corner and offer nice wraps and veggi curry for decent prices.

Indian food is always a safe bet, several good indian food places in EVERY city in Switzerland. 

There is alpnermagronen(sp?) in most swiss restaurants, just ask them to hold the bacon/ham. Its a mix of potatoes and pasta, with fried onions. Quite tasty.

Pizza is really good in Switzerland I find, with at least a few veggie options in each place.

If you have any specific questions about Lucerne, just ask!

The reason behind all this is that once of the core tenets of the EU is free movement of people. As far as the EU sees it, Switzerland is trying to get the economic advantage of free access to the EU market without paying the price of the following the other rules, and letting Switzerland ""cheat"" like that threatens the whole structure of the EU, because most of the members would love to pick and choose which aspects they sign on to.",0,1392930323,null,0,false,0,cfkflz1,t3_1yehiw,t1_cfkflz1,t3_1yehiw,null,1432485774,2,false,Switzerland,t5_2qhp6,2

The vote about immigriation wasn't coupled to the bilateral agreements willingly, it just happens that one of the bilateral treaties that Switzerland concluded with the EU included the freedom of movement of the people in the EU (ability to live and work wherever they want), and since the initiative would limit the freedom of movement of the people inside the EU into Switzerland it would need to be renegotiated.

* Did I miss something or get something spectacularly wrong in general?

The SVP promised (lied) that the initiative would be compatible with the bilateral treaties and that Switzerland would be able to renegotiate the free movement treaty with the EU easily, which doesn't seem to be the case.
