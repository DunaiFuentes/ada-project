true,markus_b,vd,Vaud,"I think the CFF do a good job, in general, you get from point A to point B in the allotted time.

Years ago they introduced a timetable called 'Taktfahrplan', roughly translatable to 'bar timetable'. The main invention was that trains left every hour at the same time. So you know there is a train from Lausanne to Bern at 20 minutes past the hour, from 06:20 in the morning to 22:20 every day. This greatly simplifies taking the train as you only have to know how many minutes past the hour your train leaves. Before this departure times were arbitrary.

So the entire train system is finely honed since years within this hourly system. It is very interlocked too, one late trains may cause other trains to have to delay too. So if there is a problem somewhere it rapidly causes delays all across the country. So most days this works perfectly with all trains on time, but once in a while a problem somewhere gets the system out of whack and half the trains in the country are late.",0,1389703509,null,0,false,0,cep8b8b,t3_1v445z,t1_cep8b8b,t3_1v445z,null,1435531274,9,false,Switzerland,t5_2qhp6,9
