Government paying 70 out of 350 or 200: This is not stupidly subsidizing a private company for multiple reasons. First, the amount you receive is *not* determined by federal government, nor by the canton. It is determined by the municipalities (Gemeinde). The municipalities have all the freedom to do what the want to do. Secondly, the amount of what you are receiving, in all municipalities I know of, is determined *only* by what you earn and where you live, and not by what plan you have. Privacy laws forbid municipalities to store information about which citizen is at which company. Thirdly, and very importantly, it is *not* subsidizing a *private* company with taxpayers money. You don't know if the poster above has healthcare plan with a private company, or with a publicly owned one.

Also, as I've said above, *no one is stopping federal government, the individual states (cantons), municipalities (Gemeinde) or other private institutions (e.g. unions/Genossenschaften) to offer their own healthcare plan.*

That's one out of 6. But they're practically invisible in society and media debates. People who are poor die sooner and have lower quality of life.
