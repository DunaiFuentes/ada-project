We were not as active as our surrounding neighbours but before the Congress of Vienna in 1814/15 Switzerland was not a neutral country and it supplied a lot of mercenaries to warring nations (most notably the elite guard protecting the French King who were massacred during the French Revolution, still remembered in the fameous [Lion Monument](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lion_Monument) in Lucerne, and the Swiss Guard protecting the Pope to this day).

I don't think that our form of government is the main reason we haven't been at war for so long. I'm unfamiliar with the exact details, but if the Federal Council (our ruling body consistend of our 7 ministers) decides we are at war then *maybe* the parliament will get to have a say but there will certainly be no popular vote after that (it would take too much time we presumably do not have in case of a war) but from there on out it's general mobilization and fighting. 
I think the actual reason that we haven't been at war is that **everyone** agrees that we are a neutral country. Our politicians included. That's why the only reason for us to be at war would be if we were to be attacked, which hasn't happened in the modern era. Just proposing an offensive war in earnes is political suicide, and preparing a campaign takes some time so it would allow enough time to be voted down or more or less immediately be recalled.

Also, there is no secession possible like the USA could do. Over there is an article where a convent or a delegation could decide to change or dissolve the Union. No such thing here, Switzerland (as in the Confederatio *Helvetica*) is for eternity.  
Some even say that the Signature of the constitution by the Cantons after the Sonderbundskrieg anno 1848 was a violent overthrow and revolution by progressive liberals, not a true democratic way of doing things. The threat was clearly Europe, falling into nationalistic movements. A weak Switzerland wouldn't have stood the influx of foreign capital and ideas. The counter movement was the introduction of more federated (not: federal) powers and the plebiscite. We also have to remember that parts of Switzerland remained parts of the German Holy Roman Empire *after* 1848, just for that. 

I would like to weak Bern even more. Just like the Tea Party in the US hates D.C. There are far more Swiss (mostly those earning money and understanding politics, not the 20-something useless commie Rumspringa) who agree with the demands of those fundie-groups of the US. UKIP, FPÖ, Lega, Front-National are all very anti-foreigners, but the core of their bemoaning, that the EU is a futile, arrogant and overdimensioned behemoth. The Swiss see it in their confederation: Bern was a tiny capital with a federal budget of a few millions/year. Now its over 60 *Billion* Swiss Francs that are shuffled around. Now imagine the numbers in 30 years for the EU. And no recurse whatsoever! No referendum on taxes, rates or fees! The horror!
