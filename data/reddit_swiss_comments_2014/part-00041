I personally don't like these aggressive anti immigration campaigns either. However, the core of the matter isn't xenophobic in my opinion.

A lot of Swiss universities are now investing into research programs they hope to get funded full or in part by the Horizons 2020 initiative of the EU.

Programs get accepted (yay!)
The whole bilaterale thing crimbles and funding is canceled by the EU (noooo!)

It's always a good thing to get more information.

&gt;In the very following sentence I call myself a layman.

It's a thing of logic. If you say everyone is an expert, this means all. All includes everything. So no thing can not be not included. This makes it paradox, if you exclude yourself from being an expert. It wouldn't mean ""all"" anymore, but mostly. You then should say: Most people ""become economy and international relations experts in the wake of such initiatives"".

&gt;However, the core of the matter isn't xenophobic in my opinion.

It is. It's the whole thing again of: ""I am from the inside, and you are from the outside"", or ""I am that thing (eg. aric), you are a differnt thing (eg. jewish), and therefore I am better (or anything like that)"".
The inititive is builded upon a very nationalist thinking. Only then you get the categories of ""insider"" and ""outsider"". It's not even argumented on a systematical ground! Eg: ""we are part of a functional group of people, and this group cannot contain more members"". That would at least make sense. But it is in the end nothing but a statement with a truth condition, meaning it can be either true or false. I would say it is false, since no reasonable argument has been given, why no more members can be included.

You know that when you migrate to Basel, that you have **dead sure** 100 other humans from your nation already there and thus somebody to connect with and to meet (other) foreigners, Basler and Swiss fellows? We have ppl here from every nation of the world.  
If you are a Turk in Entlebuech as displayed or in West-SH, Thal, Glarus etc, you only have your three other families and you *probably* belong to the poorer population. Thus you end up likelier to do illegal, unwanted or highly creative stuff, which is suspicious in every remote or rural region.

Oh, and the other reason: Almost all immigrants believe into ""Wachstum, Wachstum über alles"", just because their families experienced a wonderful hundredfold better live in three generations, just as the Swiss did, but the migrants experienced it in 30 years.  
Basel had immigrants since forever. About 50% since before WWI; some think that because of the more slower pace 150 years back, the share was actually that since 200 years. Curiously Basel and Zürich are also politically most inclined to green ideas, several initiatives proof that. But those committees aren't the same citizens as those immigration-liberals. Mostly, they are professionals, who want to have energy security or some buck from the state too or to revive local contractor economy. It depends.

true,I_fucked_OPs_Mom,null,null,"Not true at all. In fact Martin Schulz, who is German and leads the EU Parliament, called to caution and measurement before condining Switzerland for the irresponsible vote of last Sunday. 

You really swallowed the SVP pill, didn't you? Switzerland wanted all of the benefits of being a EU member (--&gt; access to a market of 500 million inhabitants for it's products and services) withouth having actually to join. They even could put up trade barriers to protect their farmers and enjoy cheap imports. 

They crafted a deal called Bilateral Agreement, the EU said 'Well, the Swiss have come up with something very reasonable, let's go for it'. There was not much negotiation at all, the Swiss got **exactly what they wanted**. Now that they are facing more immigration from the EU (all this with an unemployment rate of less than 4%), suddenly this is not good enough. 

If the EU tells Switzerland to go fuck themselves (and they most likely will), in about 10 years you can enjoy buing your tomatoes for 10 CHF per kg, along with failing health services, and crappy customer service in general. And enjoy your retirement money, if there is anything left after they increased your AHV contribution quota by about 1/3 or more. Should I go on? 

You people really shot yourselves in the foot. 

EDIT: I might add that the situation you have with immigrants in Ticino is a bit different than it is in the rest of Switzerland, especially with Italians commuting and eroding wages on the long term since they can live with a much smaller income in Italy than the Ticinense in Switzerland. This is a legitimate concern and should be addressed (and there are legal means to do it, like decreasing the number of permits), it also explains the high outcome of yes votes in Ticino. 

But these are other means than effectively breaking the agreement with the EU. Switzerland worked hard to achieve this result, the benefits outnumber the costs by far. And the costs could have been dealt with.

The hate is when you start thinking you need to get rid of those different looking guys, which is the conclusion the drawing is supposed to lead you to.

So maybe xenophobia is better than your definition of racism, which must be something like apartheid or slavery. It is still a pretty ineffective way of taking decisions, and makes you easy to manipulate by cynical politicians. 

Anyway the SVP has earned its xenophobic credentials through years of campaigning. Any other party would back down and apoligize if anything they did was racist, the SVP thrives on being called racist. It's the reason for their success, which began around the time they started to absorb all the far-right parties. If you can't see that you're just kidding yourself.

We have solidarity not just in health care, but pension, public transportation, tax system, education system (why the hell should you pay for schools if you have no kids?

Short something about the conservatives. ""Against"" is again a very strict word. I do have a contrary point of view. Mainly because in Switzerland we have a low aboriton and a low teenage pregnancy rate. That's pretty good and impressive. What I loved the most was the fact, that I had to belive none of them ever had to go thorugh the process of an aboriton. I never had any doubt they were able to put themselves in the situation of being a young man/woman that had sex, something got wrong (we all know what and how can go wrong), that went for the after-sex pill and that still got pregnant (there is a possibility of this to happen). However, this is the great thing about this coutry. They went on the street, got the signatures, put all stuff toghether and we had a vote.

Yes it is a fundamental principle in switzerland, but that doesn't mean we shouldn't critize it, question it and change it for the better.

Yes, these are good examples and I profit from some of these things too. For example our education system. I just got accepted to a university and only need to pay 1200.- every year. That's nice and it's really convinient. The question is, would it be cheaper for me (as an individual) if I paid for it myself but wouldn't have to pay taxes (for art projects I don't enjoy, Healthcare I don't need, etc.)?

No, I am pro abortion. I am against paying for an abortion even if it was not me who got pregnant or my wife/girlfriend/sex companion. I don't draw a line. I am against every form of solidarity, that means everyone pays for what they need.

Swisscom in Ticino already hires Italians **only if** they move from Italy to Switzerland permanently (or at least until they leave or get fired).

Actually, I have nothing against Italians moving to Switzerland and contributing actively to the Swiss life. Italians already pay a small part of their taxes to Switzerland.

The main point is the average wage. Italy of course has way lower salaries than Switzerland, this makes almost any Swiss/Ticinese employable man and woman way too expensive for companies.

I'm an IT consultant and there are actually no jobs in IT, zero, nichts, nada, available now in Ticino with a decent retribution. Why should any company in Ticino give higher wages when you can pay someone from Como like you could pay a Migros shop assistant?

I regret that you're angry about it, but you vastly underestimate Freddy Blaser and Hansueli Schweizer.  ""They"" understand very well that there will be consequences - it's a common mistake politicians, particularly in big countries, make to underestimate the intelligence of voters and to not credit them with the ability to make these decisions for themselves.  Many of us take voting quite seriously; we are provided with extensive information and arguments about the things we vote on, including strong counter-arguments.  In this case, they were _very_ explicit about what the possible results might be.  You don't just get a box to mark ""yes/no"" with a fat red pen.  That isn't how it works.

You also massively overestimate the impact the SVP stupid-campaigns had on voters.  Maybe they were the straw that broke the camel's back, but at worst, they touched up on something that was already present.  Many Swiss voters (myself included) believe that uncontrolled immigration over the last years, while being great for the overall cultural and economic landscape of the country, has had detrimental effects on several aspects of the job market, such as salaries, competitiveness, quality, etc..  Unfortunately these concerns are often derided as ""takin' err jerrbs"", which again belittles legitimate worries.

Switzerland didn't vote to put up a Berlin wall.  Nor did it say ""yo, you, Johnny foreigner, GTFO, we don't want you"".  Simply put, the country voted to put controls in place, and that we're going to decide what those controls are.  And yes, there'll be consequences - we can only hope that the EU is mature enough to accept a democratic decision and work together with the Swiss to figure out a pragmatic outcome rather than decide to throw a temper tantrum like a five-year-old who didn't get his way.  

Leave that to the Americans, Europe is better than that.

If you feel personally attacked, that's unfortunate, but it's also your decision.

These initial overly emotional reactions, as you say, will settle.  But I would have expected more statesmanlike behavior from the equivalent of Juncker.  

I see a number of interesting results already, though.  

First, a lot of EUians (what _do_ we call them?) seem to be very warily paying attention to Brussels' reaction to the Swiss popular vote.  I think the EU has to tread lightly - its democratic credentials have taken massive hits in the past, for example in the way the Irish vote on the Nice treaty was handled.  Given that there's already a lot of Euroskepticism among EU populations due to perceived (right or wrong) lack of democratic accountability, a vindictive reaction to the Swiss vote could backfire heavily.  It's also encouraging to see so many EU citizens disowning the angrier reactions as inappropriate.

Second, and I'm not sure what to make of it, there seem to be noises from non-fringe groups in several European countries saying, hey, you guys basically did what we've been thinking.

And third, to their credit, several German left-leaning parties and politicians have stated that, despite their disappointment in the result, they'd like to see more popular democracy introduced in their country.
