She then contacted her legal defense insurance, which are now asking you to either send the customer the iPhone or reimburse the money to the insurance by Dec 8. The letter is signed by two lawyers.

The people writing the letter are not a legal entity, just a private insurance, so this document is just a warning and not some sort of binding court order. I assume they will take legal steps against you should you not comply though. I'd suggest you verify the contact and banking information to make sure the letter is legit, then contact ricardo.ch and talk to an attorney if necessary.


Edit: Assuming the letter is legit, and assuming what I'm writing below is true, I would suggest that you write them back by registered mail that you refuse to comply with their request because:

* You have no ricardo.ch account and have now contacted ricardo.ch about this issue (include a case number).
* You have not sold an iPhone on ricardo.ch or anywhere else during the time in question.
* You have not received a payment of CHF 670 or any other amount by their client during the time in question.

Adapt as necessary if you do in fact have a ricardo.ch account but never sold an iPhone to their client during the time in question. It's their job to prove that you owe their client the money, not vice versa.

Edit 2: If they then still think you owe their client the money, they will most likely send you two payment reminders (""Mahnung""), which you can ignore, followed by a payment summons (""Zahlungsbefehl"") from a government office. The latter means that legal proceedings against you have started, and you need to dispute the debt. Consult [this site](https://www.ch.ch/en/receiving-payment-summons/) for further information.

That Miss M. got scammed and paid the scammer by banktransfer.
The scammer didn't deliver. She contacted her legal insurance company so they would pressure this person into delivery. 

Legal insurance is handy because they take legal action for you if you need it. You only have to pay a monthly fee. I'm not sure if you have that in the UK.

I don't think that you're in trouble, but it's better to clear things up.
