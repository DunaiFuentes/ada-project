In an international comparison: Not really, but with a narrower horizon there are significant differences.

&gt; What subtle differences are there to be noticed?

They're not all that subtle. First difference you notice is the language. The Swiss dialect is not easily understood by Germans. On the other hand Swiss people often do understand Germans better.  
Unfortunately there is a kind of animosity towards the German language, so Germans are immediately identified and sometimes shunned just because of the way they speak.

Then Swiss people are usually a bit more subtle, indirect, stuck-up, formal, private and colder than Germans in the way they talk to each other and conduct business in general.

Swiss people don't like Germans for their harsh words, while the Germans use this kind of language to be a bit less formal and when they're in a good mood. This good mood is then answered with a cold shoulder by the Swiss who find the behavior impolite.

And I guess there's a lot more, but I'm really the wrong person to describe this, because I'm part German and I don't mind Germans in my country.

true,Wh1sperw1nd,gr,Graubünden,"I once talked to a foreign exchange student who was studying economics. There are actually courses on how to do business with the Swiss.

From what he told me I remember that the Swiss are remarkable in the way that they always go to negotiations with a compromise already in mind which they will be pressing towards. Appearently it is in other countries more usual to go to negotiations with the for the party most favourable position in mind. This is probably a reason why Swiss diplomats are popular mediators in international conflicts.

Another point I remember was the Swiss attitude towards work in comparison to the German attitude. A typical German works very diligent and thoroughly. He also shows much commitment when it comes to the optimisation of his specific work and cooperates easily when confronted with management decision that will change his work environment. The Swiss on the other hand work just as diligent and thoroughly as the Germans and show great commitment towards optimisation as well. The major difference is that they have a greater desire to be involved when it comes to management decisions. This mirrors in Swiss society. A big majority of Swiss workers work in small to medium sized companies where they can involve themselves more easily. Swiss also have a statistically bigger job satisfaction than most other peoples.

One important point when dealing with the Swiss is that when they say they will do something then they will do exactly that. For the Swiss it can be very confusing for example when foreigners say things like ""we should totally have lunch together some time"". The Swiss guy will already make plans in his mind to when and where they should have lunch whereas this sentence was more of an empty phrase. Appearently the Austrians are especially quick to agree to do business in the future but don't necessarily mean it. The Swiss business man then returns from the meeting and is confident that his Austrian colleague will call him pretty soon but in reality never will.

One last thing I got as an advice for dealing with Germans: when a Swiss guy asks you about the status of a project then it means that he is worried. It means that he wants to be reassured that things are going according to time table and that there are no complications. Germans are used to a much directer tone.
