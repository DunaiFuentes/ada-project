The EU *clearly* limits national sovereignty of its members. It's like the whole point of it. That's not even remotely a question.

Let's not act like Switzerland's wealth is founded on them. Switzerland did very well before and will do well after (if they're cancelled, which they aren't as of now). Also, let's not act like the EU isn't getting a lot out of those agreements either. 

&gt;Just consider education: Switzerland saves billions on the long term in education, because a career in, say, Medicine, comes at a price to the state.

Immigration has a lot of positive consequences and also some negative ones. Pretty much everyone can agree on this.

&gt;The reason is quite simple, you Swiss are way to entitled and like to have your arse wiped by everyone, so you have to get workforce from abroad to do the ""dirty jobs"" for you.

You sound like a grade A asshole. What about go fuck yourself?

What about... no? Immigration will not suddenly stop. Actually, nothing says that it will even stabilise or go down. The economy will still get all the foreign workforce they need. I don't think you know what you're talking about.
