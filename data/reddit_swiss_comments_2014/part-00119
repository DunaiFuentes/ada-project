true,dreamscapejanitor,null,null,"i think the issue with switzerland's music scene is that  it suffers from not having enough people supporting it. There are many different ways to support a music scene, but all those ways pretty much lead to more bands being formed, which in turn leads to a scene finding its own individual sound. 

anyways, this has forced a lot of the swiss music acts to become popular by appealing to the lowest common denominator with family-friendly, generic pop/techno/whatever sound (a good example would be DJ Bobo and these DJs who can't seem to plug in their equipment correctly). Instead of crafting an original sound with good songwriting, they try to get people with copious free time and money to waste on their music (mostly teenagers).

That being said, there are some bands from Switzerland who work damn hard at making good music. One example is Disco Doom, who make really cool shoegazy alternative rock stuff. I highly recommend them.

No, I do not ""get the idea"". Comparing the Montreux jazz festival and soccer matches is border line bad faith.

I find mind-blowing that it is accepted as a inevitable fact of life that a sub-population systematically causes damage and that the cost is for the taxpayer.

I have no problem to pay for police forces to deal with the unexpected and the inevitable ""evil"" of society. Soccer fans and hooligans are neither unexpected nor inevitable. They should be dealt with prior to the events, not by pouring money for damage control at every single match.

I think most has allready been answered, but some things I would like to add.

Music

There are many music festivals (most in the summer) with big national and international musicians. But also lots of advertising and security people. And lots of drinking ( and puking &amp; pissing everywhere). It's usually between 2 and 4 days and costs around 200 SFR.
But there are also small ones, usually in the mountains and you have to hike there. Those are very beatiful, with not only bands, but also workshops, poetry slam, doing art, dicussions, everything :-)
I will not post the links here because they usually stop as soon as too many people go there, but I will write you if you're interested.

It seems you are very interested in learning about switzerland and trying not to make mistakes, I think with this attitude everything will be allright.

okay, nothing to see here. move along.

in all seriousness though, we're setting up tax paid military to secure Davos. every single time.

as for soccer specific issues recently discussed (my guess is you're talking mostly about the cup finals in berne, yes?) then it should be clear that several things went afoul by the organisators themselves. how they could have let the visitors walz over the bridge and not reacting yet before the match? no idea. how the soccer clubs did not just stop the match upon the first ""fireworks"" being lit inside the stadium is beyond me. and how none of the clubs managed to stand in front of a press agency and simply state to send any cleanup and repair checks (and all things stolen) to them is also beyond me.

but beware of generalizing. police forces *do* charge soccer clubs for their work. but usually it is not the full amount, thus why tax money is involved. and also it should be noted that while doing this securitas work the police is bound and cannot respond to other matters.

though i actually prefer police on the streets during those events more than securitas, since securitas are often not well trained and can make things go for the worse easily. 

another solution could be to hire some Hells Angels though, like some festivals do. many fans might think different of throwing something at one of them...",0,1398635452,null,0,false,0,ch3ltxb,t3_243uq6,t1_ch3ltxb,t1_ch3kmpm,null,1433548043,3,false,Switzerland,t5_2qhp6,3
