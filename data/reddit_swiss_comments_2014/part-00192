&gt; And by your logic: In my opinion I am not doing anything wrong and my opinion is as good as yours, right?

I obviously meant that your opinion is just as valuable as any other opinion in a vote but not more valuable. That doesn't mean that your opinion is just as good as mine. It means that I view it as equally valuable, but not necessarily equally good/bad in a vote.

If someone doesn't care enough and/or doesn't inform themselves about an issue/vote, their vote should not be used. It just wouldn't be fair to everybody else out there who cares and informed themselves just as much as you did.

I'll try to make you think about it with the following simple scenario:

There is a village. Only 6 people live there.

* 2 lazy people
* 1 dumb person
* 1 smart person
* You
* A Miliarist

Let's say they have a vote about wheter or not they want to start an attack on some friendly tribe.

You are against the attack but the militarist manages to get all the votes from the lazy and dumb people.

4 people vote for the attack and 2 against it.

Do you consider this fair?
