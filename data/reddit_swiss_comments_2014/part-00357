Also; the laws around running banks vary greatly depending on region. FDR at one point banned the ownership of gold. In fact even in modern times, a person was charged with counterfeit for minting ""Gold Liberty Dollars"".

&gt;Also: There's no word of any length of blade in the actual Waffengesetz

This I did not know and that kind of baffles me. However, I do think that this is probably how our legal system works - the EJPD (Eidgenössisches Justiz- und Polizeidepartement) interprets the law here and makes certain things more specific because our law isn't clear enough about it. How exactly this works, I don't know. Maybe there is also a judge and/or a verdict behind that. I am not sure how exactly this works but I know as much: Just because it's not in the law doesn't mean that there hasn't been a previous decision by a judge somewhere.
