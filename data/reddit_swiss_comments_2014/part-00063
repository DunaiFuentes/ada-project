The whole strategy is that if the security situation in Europe would deteriorate, then the government would allocate resources (money and manpower) to the army to rebuild a war capable army.


What annoys me a lot are dear Swiss citizen who whine that the army costs too much yet find it completely logical to complain that said army is not good enough at the same time. Let's face the truth, the Swiss army budget has halved since the 90s if you take inflation into account and it has made a lot of compromises to minimize the time it requires from citizens (that 6 weeks officer selection process is a direct consequence of the army being told to find a way to not take ~50 weeks to make an officer) so it's no surprise said army cannot maintain a cold war readiness.


If you want cold war readiness then you'd need to double the army's budget (at least), increase the amount of days served by everyone (back to 4-5 weeks training courses from the 2 we do now) and put up with a lot more army nuisances (big formation manoeuvers tearing through fields and the like).

In my opinion though that's not really the army's fault but the politician's fault. It's them that ought to have told the army to maintain 24/7 airforce coverage and also them that ought to have proposed which other capability they were willing to sacrifice in exchange.


The big problem is that our government decides which list of capabilities the army has to provide and then, in a completely disconnected way, also arbitrarily decides how much money the army gets. That'd be like if you could go to BMW and tell them you want a BMW M5 with the luxus package, hand them 10'000 CHF and tell them to make it happen.
You shouldn't be surprised if the BMW ""M5"" you get is actually only an older used standard 5 series with an M glued in front of it.

Ideally the politicians should tell the army what they want and the army would give the politicians a price tag to force the politicians to explicitely abandon capabilities in exchange of cost reductions.

Some friends and I were cooking some meat over a campfire by the Limmat (on Werdinsel). Just beside us, there was a larger group of rowdy-looking individuals who seemed to be doing drugs. At one point, a girl in her bathing suit runs over to our group and starts screaming for help. A man from the other group is chasing her and, when he caught up to her, starts hitting her, pulling her hair, dragging her around by her hair, etc. He pushed her onto our fire (bear in mind that she was in her bathing suit). He kept calling her a whore and she kept apologising and wouldn't let go of his leg. The fight was pretty brutal. A couple of us tried to intervene and break it up, but the guy just swung at us violently. So we called the police. When they finally arrived, they did nothing. They asked us to explain what had happened and then they said that we should just leave and forget what happened. They said that they wouldn't deal with this situation because it wouldn't help anything anyway. They said they didn't want to take up holding cells at the police station because, basically, it wouldn't deter these people from doing the same thing again.

This experience turned me off from the police here, but it's not the only bad experience I've had.

The punishment for such things is not even a prison sentence, and they probably just don't pay up fines since they're on social aid. Also the girl wasn't going to press charges against the guy who gives her the drugs so it would be a waste of paperwork. They have these anger attacks all the time and the police is powerless. 

In the second case, you got the local cowboy team. Here the local cowboys tackled a teen-age girl in a bikini who was bathing illegally (near the port you can't do that) at night to the pavement. 
In another city, they took a drunkard who was making a rumpus at the train station and beat him up and let him go on a road away from the city. 
In another case, the lynx team (an intercantonal group in inner switzerland) mistook two innocents guys in a car for their target. These guys wear no insigna and have their faces masked and are trained to arrest dangerous criminals, the two guys reacted because they failed to identify and were beaten up by the policemen.
