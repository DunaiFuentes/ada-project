Everyone hires foreigners for all kinds of jobs - not just manual (or close to manual labor) or programming. Accounting, HR, administration, controlling - all kinds of paper pushers. Not very specialized either.

The companies get applications and they like the idea that those people would work for less money. Of course you find one or the other company that doesn't do that because foreigners are evil or whatever.

I do (partly) agree about the linking those issues, but it's part of the whole picture I think. It's about making Swiss employees unattractive - salary is one thing, being around all the time is the another. It all adds up.

I've seen SMB project managers rage when they found out that one employee isn't going to be around when the customer wanted him to. And they did cover by getting a foreigner to do it.

This is post cleaning. The rifle is in excellent condition. The barrel was really dirty when I got it but it cleaned out easily enough. I bought the walnut, handpicked version from Aim Surplus. Shipping was fast and customer service was excellent.

Actually the swiss army knifes (or Sackmesser, as the locals call it) are quite handy. If you buy one, I would go for the smallest one with a wine bottle opener. Thats the reason I bought one ;) it's ideal as keychain and it is really handy. But outside of Switzerland it's probably a bit uncommen to walk around with a knife... except it's more a tool as a knife.

 [**Tête de Moine**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T%C3%AAte%20de%20Moine): [](#sfw) 

---

&gt;

&gt;__Tête de Moine__ is a type of cheese manufactured in Switzerland. It was invented and initially produced more than eight centuries ago by the monks of the [abbey of Bellelay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bellelay_Abbey), located in the community of [Saicourt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saicourt), district of [Moutier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moutier), in the mountainous zone of the [Bernese Jura](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernese_Jura), the French-speaking area of the [Canton of Bern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canton_of_Bern).

&gt;Traditionally, the cheese is prepared for eating in an unusual way: the cheese is carefully scraped with a knife to produce thin shavings, which is said to help develop the odour and flavour by allowing oxygen to reach more of the surface.

&gt;There are two [explanations for the origin of the name Tête de Moine](http://www.tetedemoine.ch/en/history/the-origins), which translates literally as ""Monk's Head."" The name was first documented in the records of *Mont-Terrible*, a Department established by the French when they annexed the region from 1793 to 1799 at the time of the [French Revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Revolution). The first theory is that it is a mocking name bestowed by French occupation soldiers who compared the method of serving the cheese to shaving the top of a skull to create a monk’s [tonsure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tonsure). The second explanation is based on tales from the Jura region which refer to the number of cheeses stored at the cloister “per tonsure”, or per resident monk.
