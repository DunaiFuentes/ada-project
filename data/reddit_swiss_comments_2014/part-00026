&gt;

&gt;The **Lauberhorn** is a mountain in the Bernese Alps of Switzerland, located between Wengen and Grindelwald, north of the Kleine Scheidegg. Its summit is at an elevation of 2,472 m (8,110 ft) above sea level.

&gt;The mountain is best known as the site of the Lauberhorn alpine ski races (German: Lauberhornrennen), held annually above Wengen in the Bernese Oberland. The downhill course is the longest in the world; its enormous length of 4.455 km (2.768 mi) results in run times of two and a half minutes (about 30–45 seconds longer than standard downhill races); top speeds approach 160 km/h (100 mph) on its Haneggschuss, the highest speeds on the FIS World Cup circuit. The Lauberhorn downhill run is said to be the most picturesque in the world, surrounded by the Eiger, Mönch, and Jungfrau above the Lauterbrunnen valley, and usually held under brilliant blue skies in mid-January. It is also known for its spectacular run arrangements as the Hundschopf, a signature 40 m (130 ft) jump over a  ...

true,markus_b,vd,Vaud,"The Berufslehre is a way to learn a profession. It sort of compares with college, but with much more practice and much less school. It is widely available to young folks in Switzerland and Germany for professional education.

The duration is from 2 to 4 years, depending on the profession you want to learn. After finishing you'll pass a test and get a countrywide recognized diploma. Classical professions are mechanic, electrician, clerk (office or sales). During the apprenticeship you will work in a company (on the job training) and go to school 1+ days a week. You'll get a small salary.

What profession are you interested in ?
Where in Switzerland are you located ?

You probably need to speak/read/write the local language to succeed.",0,1390861988,null,0,false,0,cf0enlq,t3_1wb61c,t1_cf0enlq,t3_1wb61c,null,1432134015,6,false,Switzerland,t5_2qhp6,6

If you're willing to travel further, Leysin is a great resort, and so is Verbier (although it's more expensive). ",0,1390862970,null,0,false,0,cf0f4r8,t3_1wa2ok,t1_cf0f4r8,t3_1wa2ok,null,1432134209,1,false,Switzerland,t5_2qhp6,1
