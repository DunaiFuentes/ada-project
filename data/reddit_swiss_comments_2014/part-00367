&gt; Second, pandering to the SVP will not work, because it misreads the nature of the party’s appeal to a core of disgruntled, down-at-heel, poorly skilled voters, in bad jobs or no jobs. Having been most damaged by the downturn, then by austerity, they will be the last to feel the benefits of the recovery. Their main complaint, echoed across the Western world, is against powerful and irreversible economic trends—globalisation and automation—from which they are the losers. Their antipathy towards the EU and immigration is part of a wider deep-seated insecurity that is hard for any politician to assuage. SVP’s solutions would make the disaffected worse, not better, off, as business and jobs migrated elsewhere. Besides, many such voters trust establishment politicians from the FDP/CVP and SP so little that they would not believe them even if they did promise the same sort of things as Blocher, SVP’s blokeish leader.",0,1417841786,null,0,false,0,cmmp1ja,t3_2oaa95,t1_cmmp1ja,t1_cmlijxz,null,1425578180,1,false,Switzerland,t5_2qhp6,1

I was travelling from Bern to Geneva last night. 
The train had only two stops.  Fribourg and lausanne. 
Upon arrival at Geneva,  I noticed my laptop bag was gone :(
My alienware laptop,  with 4 hard drives all gone. 
12 years of my work,  history in photos,  and everything else gone. 

I reported it to the police in Geneva,  and I was planning to to do the same at Sbb but it was closed .  Gonna go to SBB station today to report it. 

It couldn't have happened in Geneva because I had full situational awareness of my surroundings when train was arriving. 
It probably happens in lausanne.  Or fribourg perhaps I'm not sure. 

I'm sure those of you who experienced this understand my depression now.  As said  before,  it is not about the hardware,  rather the history I lost.  I feel like I just lost my identity and History. 

If anyone has any suggestions what I should do.  Please please please let me know. 

I have a question. Someone said SBB returned their back empty. 
So does that mean,  the culprits open the bag at the station itself then dump the bag? 
Did you happen to know what trash or what area SBB said they found the bag.  I could go and check that general area. 

Thanks guys for help, 
:(
