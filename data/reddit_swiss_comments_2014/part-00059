For skiing, from Lausanne you have the best of both worlds, you can go to french ski slopes over Geneva (Chamonix, Megève, Contamines, Les Gets, etc.) or even better, the ski slopes in the Valais to the east (Diablerets, Leysin, etc.) or even take the Goldenpass Express from Montreux for an unforgettable view and great slopes in the Bernese ""Oberland"" (Zweisimmen, Gstaad, Schönried). Count at least 100.- CHF / day for skiing.

EDIT: Completely forgot about the weather question. September/October are mostly still bearable (between 10-20 degrees celsuis), but for the winter you better pack some warm clothes and gloves especially if you intend to use a bicycle (since Lausanne is a sloped city, maybe a bicycle isn't ideal).

Italy however gets 2.445, that's average wage. not minimum wage.

Well then, why pay even 3500.-? After all, the boss could pay him 2000.-, surely that's still better than being unemployed. Then every boss will do that because it's cheaper, and the government foots the bill with welfare.

We're in Switzerland, not America. The point of life is not to work like a slave for a ridiculous wage while thinking you'll one day live your dreams and become rich.  
The minimum wage should be the wage required to have a decent life; that includes hobbies and not having to spare every cent you can to afford food or rent.

Lidl advertised that heavily. They're doing it because they think people will come to Lidl more if they feel Lidl treats its workers fairly. (IIRC Lidl hires some workers for undefined hours of the week, always on call, and fires them if they can't be there enough; not what I'd call fair, and not what you'll find on advertisement billboards)

There's plenty of ""intuitive"" and ""basic math"" stuff that simply does not apply to economics for various reasons. It's intuitive that iPhones are more expensive for the same service than other phones, yet people buy them. It's basic math that nobody should buy product ""family packs"" that cost more by the kilogram, yet people still do.

Also, raising prices is not impossible, especially when your consumers get more money to spend.

What I'm asking for is simple: Do you have actual evidence, i.e. data from real life, that a minimum wage increases unemployment?

Right-wing economic groups (e.g. Economiesuisse) have been telling us for years that everything the left does for workers will cause unemployment and a bad economy, yet I didn't see the country crashing when we adopted paid vacation, basic workers' rights or more recently the Minder initiative.

I'm an evidence-based person. If there's no evidence that a minimum wage harms the economy, or if there is evidence of harm that's too small when compared to the benefits a minimum wage brings, go ahead and implement a minimum wage.
