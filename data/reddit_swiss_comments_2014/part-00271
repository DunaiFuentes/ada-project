Generally speaking, you will not be offered another contract by your project, even if you excel in your work. Most students re-apply after finishing the student contract (usually to a fellowship, though there are plenty of other ways to go).

My position, like many others, is unique, so I won't go into detail, but I'm now on an external contract (associate).

Regarding transfers: group and department transfers are possible, but I believe only on staff contracts (which are 5 years, and *very* difficult to get). Pretty much, the flexibility of your work is down to the flexibility of your project/supervisor. Again, don't lie on the application or in your CV, and you'll be fine.

2. Technical student
3. Fellowship
4. PhD/Staff

If you disagree with increasing taxes, running deficits and extending welfare programs, voting for the Republicans is the only viable choice in their two-party system.

&gt; Obama is more right wing than the Swiss FDP could ever be

I don't recall the Swiss FDP ever paying more than market price for old cars to get them off the road, trying to introduce socialized medicine, increasing unemployment benefits to over two years, or support quantitative easing and running a deficit as a matter of course. Obama isn't a socialist, but he's definitely considerably left of center on both fiscal and social issues. He wouldn't fit into the FDP; if you want to express his views in Swiss political terms, the right/pro-military wing of the SP would probably come closest to his stance.

&gt; The US with their ridiculous 2-Party-System are royally fucked.

I was wondering how long it would take until I could add anti-Americanism to the palmarès. I assume your next talking point will be how Israel is literally Hitler?",0,1410740241,null,0,1410740508,0,ckigc7h,t3_2gd1o4,t1_ckigc7h,t1_ckig30d,null,1427010086,0,false,Switzerland,t5_2qhp6,0
true,rockenrohl,null,null,"I have lived in the US myself for years. Of course things - in the population, on a local cultural / political level - are endlessly more complex. That doesn't change the fact that the GOP of 2014 (and before, but not always) is a farce. Bought &amp; bound by interest groups - &amp; sadly, that's a fact (not that Democrats are not guilty of this).

Which brings me to another point: Your idea that I might be anti-American. Ridiculous (on the contrary - I love the US, their culture, their literature, their art - etc.). That doesn't keep me from worrying that things are going to get real bad sooner than we think. What we're witnessing - in my humble opinion - is not normal politics anymore. It's not people working together trying to come up with solutions for the folks who elected them. On the contrary: More and more, it's every man for himself as well as the men who paid the bills on the way to get to the top.

Israel: I'm not even answering that. I'm not a particularly big fan of some of their recent actions, but - would I have had a better idea?

it really does sound very unique (and a bit complicated, to be honest). but i am sure that while working there, everything gets explained and all is clear :)

&gt; Generally speaking, you will not be offered another contract by your  project, even if you excel in your work.

is this really the reality? i mean, if i really do excel in what i do, there must be somebody that acknowledges that, and tries to keep you in the team. maybe not a direct contract of any kind, but they might push you to apply for another step (referring to your career ladder) and even give you a nice recommendation letter. or is this, too, not the case? it sure sounds like a common sense.

In almost all cases, yes. It can happen that your supervisor particularly wants you to stay on and finds a way to make it happen, but it is by no means the norm, and you should expect it won't happen. This is really because of the way the contracts work, and it's why HR will tell you the same thing.

You apply, and get put into a pool. Your supervisor requests you as a preference for their project, but may or may not succeed, entirely dependent on the selection committee. The selection committee is there to make sure the most appropriate candidates get assigned to the most appropriate projects, and that's it. If they decide someone else is more appropriate for your supervisor, or that you are more appropriate for a different project, then that'll be their decision.

Certainly, that career ladder, as you call it, is a series of different contracts, each individually applied for, with absolutely no assurance that any contract's project has any relationship with the last.

Just the way it is. And yes, it makes much more sense after you've been here a few months, and talked to people on different contracts.",0,1410765938,null,0,false,0,ckiq0pd,t3_2f5o1k,t1_ckiq0pd,t1_ckiin21,null,1427005559,1,false,CERN,t5_2r692,1
