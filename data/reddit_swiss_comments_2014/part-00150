&gt;

&gt;The __Swiss Path__ is the name given to a special national path in central [Switzerland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switzerland) opened in 1991. It makes a loop around one arm of [Lake Lucerne](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Lucerne), starting in [Rütli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R%C3%BCtli) and passing through Bauen, [Flüelen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fl%C3%BCelen), [Sisikon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sisikon) and [Morschach](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morschach), finishing at [Brunnen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brunnen). The total length is around 35 km (22 mi), taking 2 or 3 days to complete.

&gt;The route recognises each of the cantons making up Switzerland, with markers announcing each canton along the route. The length of route for each canton is proportional to the population at the time of building, and the order is determined by the order in which the cantons joined the Swiss federation.

Not just that, but he also managed to fill the vacuum left when the traditional liberal and centrist conservative parties (FDP, CVP) moved left or abandoned a lot of their concerns about growing government spending, taxes, and regulation - they kind of lost their directions, similar to the FDP in Germany, as the middle ground became less attractive to many voters.

Many younger people don't remember the rise of the Auto-Partei - this was originally a very simplistic, single-issue party of drivers angry at perceived hostility against cars - which eventually merged partially into the SD and partially into the SVP when many of its members decided they wanted to be angry about more than traffic issues.

This is a problem, because for a lot of voters it meant not having a credible choice any more when it came to, say, wanting to be against EU membership or increased federalization or the growth of bureaucracy, without the baggage of the SVP's right-wing xenophobic lock-up-all-the-drug-addicts crap.  In the end, I think many voters opted for what they perceived as the less worse combination, much like a lot of Republican voters in the US (e.g. I know people there who hate the social conservative shit, but who feel more directly affected by topics like taxes, so that's how they vote).",0,1401261760,null,0,false,0,chsy454,t3_26jal3,t1_chsy454,t1_chsm2c5,null,1433986296,1,false,Switzerland,t5_2qhp6,1

2. the strong amount of deviation of the SVP's cantonal sections.

I think \#2 comes from the fact that the SVP has always had different focuses in different areas - e.g. the classic split between the ""Zurich"" and ""Bern"" factions.",0,1401263620,null,0,1401263809,0,chsyhy4,t3_26jal3,t1_chsyhy4,t1_chsychv,null,1433986476,1,false,Switzerland,t5_2qhp6,1

true,P1r4nha,zh,Zürich,"It's an interesting speech. I like the beginning better than the end. Also the examples are clearly chosen from him, but that doesn't matter, there are enough other examples he could have brought up with which I would agree more.

I guess it's important to see that absolute independence is something unachievable, for individuals as well as a nation state and especially for a small country like Switzerland in the heart of Europe. But the companies, allies and organizations we make ourselves dependent on, should be carefully chosen. Maurer mentions accepting future, unknown laws of our allies. Yeah, I don't agree with that either.

It's also nice that they realize it's not about friendship, but mutual interests which can change depending on geopolitical developments. The resulting conclusion that our way of negotiation should be more about the balance of interests rather than who is nice to us seems to be more than reasonable.

What he doesn't mention much is the interaction between international corporations and their and foreign governments. This idea goes against globalization and economical liberalism, which is probably why he doesn't talk about it, but I see it as equally if not more dangerous when a foreign government is representing the interests of a corporation rather than that of their people.

I'm sure I'm missing out on a lot of other points. I also want to mention the loss of privacy laws in Switzerland. That it seems like we need to protect ourselves individually from our own and foreign governments when it comes to our privacy and not our government making steps to protect us.",0,1401269360,null,0,false,0,chsziar,t3_26oi8k,t1_chsziar,t1_chsyv33,null,1433986952,2,false,Switzerland,t5_2qhp6,2

All his points are wrong:

* 'Machtpolitik' is not a new thing, it has always been there. But now countries actually collaborate more than ever, it's getting better not worse. We have less conflicts than ever before and it's a fact that small countries such as Switzerland, Singapore or Denmark are some of the richest on the planet and have higher life standards than big countries. There's no increase in 'big countries squeezing small ones', he's just doing a SVP campaign speech here. Also free trade actually increased because of organisations like the EU. There's no proof for what he claims, his facts are wrong.

* There's no proof for an 'economic war' and the banks are not an example for it because they did actually do all these things they are accused of. He's completely making up a conspiracy theory here. It's hilarious and freighting that such a person would run our country. Also there is no proof that economic wars necessarily lead to real wars. Russia / Ukraine so far actually shows the opposite. Sanctions are used instead of tanks.

* The loss of sovereignty for countries in Europe lead to the longest period of peace for centuries. What's wrong with that? Again, he's stating things that are factually wrong.

* Then he brings up the banks again. What would the SVP say if e.g. there would be an entire industry of German companies that specialises in advising people in how to abuse the Swiss social system? Nobody is banning the banks from doing business, they are just not allowed to help people avoid taxes anymore.
Also we don't have to make the change other countries demand but then we have to life with the consequences. But that's a typical SVP problem. They always say 'we should do what's best for us' and if another countries don't agree with it, then they are the evil ones. Nobody is blackmailing us, there are just actions and reactions. We can't do whatever we want end expect everyone to agree with it. If we want to help people avoid taxes than the other countries don't want to operate a financial system with us anymore. It's our choice which road we take.

* The conflicts he mentioned aren't 'beyond our perception' but simply made up by the SVP. That's why we can't see them, because they are not there. It's quite embarrassing that he uses this argument. It's a religious argument. It's the same as saying 'god is there but you just can't see him'.

But either you have a lot of traffic, in this case probably you have to drive much less to 140 on average because of people driving not all at the same speed or there is not much traffic, but then is the time savings of 16 percent not that high...
Google says that driving from St. Gallen to Geneva is a distance of 360 km. -&gt; (360/120 - 360 / 140 ) * 60 ~= 26 min

true,SiriusCH,ag,Aargau,"130 might have worked, although I would have voted no due to environmental issues. But that is just because I put this ahead of aspects like time and the other maybe positive aspects. Additionally I am also pro public transport and think driving by car should be made inconvenient, or at least not promoted. But public transport should.

Again concerning the ""tempolimit"" if you look at Germany, having no limit in places, or 130 does not really make it much better. And it makes it far more dangerous. It anyway mainly only works when there are 3 lanes. Which is rarely the case in Switzerland. Especially during high traffic tailgaters and impatient drivers in Germany produce a lot of traffic jams. At least this is my opinion. While in Switzerland the people are much more used to drive with a constant 80-120 in high traffic. Being able to do this is very useful in preventing traffic jams. So I think it should just stay at it is.

Thats only practical for people that live in citys. I, for example, live on the countryside. If I want to use the train or the bus to get to the city of Bern, for example, it would take me 1 hour or more. With the car i'd be there in 15-20 Minutes.
