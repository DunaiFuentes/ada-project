true,electrodraco,bl,Basel-Landschaft,"You have to keep a few things in mind:

* The psychological test repeats question in different formulations. If you don't answer the test consistently, they'll notice.
* During breaks they will probably observe if you if the test results are ambiguous. Faking social anxiety and chatting with a couple of strangers is a big no-no.
* You'll be invited to a personal meeting with the chief psychologist since your test (hopefully) raised some flags. They will ask more detailed questions about your problems and probably also want examples. Make sure you actually know how a person affected by the anxiety/disorder/whatever you try to fake would say in such a situation. Preparation is key here.

If you do this successfully they will probably release you on the first day with 2xUT. However, visiting a psychiatrist of your choice beforehand and letting him handle the situation has, as far as I know, a 100% success rate and you don't even have to attend the recruiting event.

true,whitepalms85,null,null,"I got away really easy. Just mark in the psychology tests that you have problem with authority, drugs and weapons. Then you will get a meeting with the psychiatrist. You don't have to exaggerate too much or so, just tell them that you can't deal with it if they yell at you especially when you disagree with orders. Tell them that you can't deal with such situations and that you don't want to have a weapon in your hand in such a situation. Also tell them that your a drug user and that you can't always judge situations very well.

This will almost automatically dismiss you. They can't let you serve if you warn them that you could hurt someone with a weapon and that you get aggressive in a military environment. Think about some examples in advance, your story should make sense.

However, I know some people that told some totally over the top stories that they hear voices and see things and so on. I highly doubt that the psychiatrist believed that, but usually they still let you get away with it because they don't really want to force you anyway.
