1) That's cool.

2) 3/4 is relatively alright - but don't worry, not too much weightage on scores. More about meeting the requirement.

3) Highlight this both in CV and Motivation

4) WRITE TO THE ADMINISTRATION.

If there's one thing you should know about switzerland, it's that no one will tell you anything - unless you ask. 

Ignorance is not a defence in this country, and they take this extremely seriously. If you do not know something, it is because you did not bother to.

Write to them, and ask them if they will allow you take these courses as supplementary courses - maybe spend a semester before your actual masters to take them and a basic german level course - if you've got the time that is.

5) If you'd like to do your Masters here, I'm getting the feeling you'd like to work here. So German is going to become essential and some point.

6) The GRE.

If you're going to do stats, I'd suggest you ace the GRE - i.e. at least &gt; 161. Ideally 165 and above. (out of 170). This will be hugely in your favour.

Note: Unlike the U.S. or even the U.K. - Universities in Europe tend to accept you if you ""meet"" the requirements, regardless of your grade. This is because the workload will automatically weed out anyone not cut out for the programme.

I wish you the best of luck mate. And if you're around this time next year, give me a shout out and we'll grab beer.

Like hotdog says below,

7) Finances. I'd set aside at least 1000 - 1200 a month on expenses. And that's on a budget. If you're living ""normally"" I'd say that would even come to 1600 - 1800 a month. CHF.

true,YeaISeddit,bs,Basel-Stadt,"On the money issue. OP will need to apply for a D visa and once in Switzerland, a B permit. The university will handle all of this, of course. But, some important things to keep in mind will be that, in order to get the B permit (renewed yearly) he will have to demonstrate financial means of supporting himself. At the moment this is 21k CHF on a bank statement. Once in Switzerland and having applied for the B permit he can work for 15 hours per week and full time during semester breaks. It can take well over a month, sometimes over two months to get the B permit, so there will be a long stretch at the beginning where he can't work. There can be delays with the renewal that could keep him out of work when the second year comes around as well. If OP finds a job that is 15 hours a week and a full time gig over breaks he will be bringing in around 15k CHF per year at a minimum. This will basically be just enough to break even if the OP is slumming it. He still needs a 21k buffer just to get his foot in the door, though.
