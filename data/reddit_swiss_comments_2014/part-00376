false,Solitaire_Nemesis,null,null,"I would say that it is not worth it in most cases. I had a Mustang in CA, and looked into bringing it back when I moved. It turns out that between all the things I would have had to change (from the tires to the lights and even the exhaust) and the administrative hassle, I would still have had trouble in the winter due to the lack of a corrosion resistant coating on the undercarriage and the need for snow tires.
I would only recommend it if the same model or something very similar is currently being sold in Switzerland for a much higher price than in the US, if you absolutely have to drive that model, if you recently bought your car (&gt; than 6 months or you'll have to pay the import taxes), and that it still has very low mileage (&gt;10000 miles). 
In most other cases it is not worth it. For cool american cars, you will run into the following problems:

-Homologation and associated part replacement costs
-High annual taxes (based on curb weight and power)
-High gas prices
-High insurance for exotic cars
-Moving costs
-Getting help in the future when you have a problem with the car.

When I looked into it, moving was the easy part! Had I decided to do it, my movers would have been able to bring the car for a relatively low amount in addition to the rest of my stuff. Moving cost is not really proportional to volume/weight. Once you decide to move things with a container, you might as well cram as much stuff as you can in that portion of container you are using! It would have been an additional ~2000$ for me.
If your car is not a standard car being sold in Switzerland, the homologation will be time consuming and most likely expensive (exotic Mustang: check). There are people that will organize this for you, but they are pricey. I was quoted ~7000$+moving+taxes.

In addition to that, I would look into swiss taxes (https://www.ch.ch/en/vehicle-tax) - CHF1100/year for me.
Also ask for an insurance quote (https://en.comparis.ch/auto/) - CHF1500/year for me.
And finally call a few garages to see if they would be willing to help you with your american car (claim you are already here and have an issue that needs fixing now, other wise they'll just say yes regardless ;) )  

Doing a few of those things will make you realize that every time you need to do something linked to bureaucracy you will have to jump though a bunch of extra hoops because you don't have a standard car. Do you really want to deal with this every few months?

I also realized it would become a hassle to sell the car in Switzerland. For me, that was the deciding factor, and once I got over it I realized how much of a pain all the rest of those issue were.
My final recommendation: sell your car, and get excited by buying a different car here!",0,1418474472,null,0,false,0,cmtoie4,t3_2owo3f,t1_cmtoie4,t3_2owo3f,null,1425454793,2,false,Switzerland,t5_2qhp6,2

Try to sort your accommodation out as early as possible. The Geneva area (including France around it) does not have too many flats/apartments available. The belief that France is cheaper is mostly wrong (people usually forget that they have to pay the taxe d'habitation at the end of the year which usually boils down to one or two extra months rent). And additionally, the infrastructure in France will require you to have and maintain a car - you generally don't need this in Switzerland. Try to find a flatshare or so, that usually works out quite well.
