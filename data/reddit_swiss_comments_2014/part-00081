January and february weren't colder than november/december (late autumn-early winter) but that's it. It also snowed a few times in the lowlands in February (in the south, the north got barely any snow). 
It's just a couple degrees of difference from the usual. 

Basically there was rarely freezing in the lower areas, while usually it goes below freezing (like -1°C or so) at night, and there are a few very cold days where during the day it barely gets above freezing. There was none of that this year, temps were usually comfortable. 

But the valleys in the region got record amounts of snow. 

The last week of winter was mid-spring warm (max of 20-24°C), but lasted only a few days and now there are the usual early spring temps. 

In summer there are maximums of 25-30°C every day if there's just thunderstorms and not proper rain (this can be 2-2.5 months long if there's no rain, usually there are a couple weeks of rain in total though, when it's a bad summer it can even be a whole month) and it rarely gets below 18°C at night in July, so it's a vastly different thing.
