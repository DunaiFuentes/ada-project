Monthly cost:

Rent - CHF 3000

TV, Water, Gas etc - CHF 200

Food - CHF 800 - 1200

Car - CHF 600 - 1500 (i drive an SLK 300 and calculate around CHF 1500 a month for amortisation (6year lifespan), gas, insurance (a must by law) and maintanance.)

Health insurance - approx CHF 250-350 per adult depending on the cost coverage you want.

Tax - CHF 800 - 1500: this really depends on your income and where you live. Usually rent pricea will be lower if the tax is higher. So balancing itself.

This will cover your basic cost. Not including, clothing, leisure activities etc.

true,royalbarnacle,null,null,"I'm in exactly the same situation as you, and have been doing lots of research (and talking to Swiss friends). Here are my findings, and I welcome any corrections/comments...

First, without knowing what you're used to and what your expectations are, it's hard to comment. For me as a middle-aged middle-class guy with 2 kids, who enjoys a bit of travel, 100-120K is pretty low especially if you're after a 3 bedroom place. 

Here's my math:

- You can deduct ballpark 20% for taxes. Careful when using salary calculators or looking up government figures, because often they are only talking about the withholding tax, but you also have to consider unemployment insurance, the 3-pillar pension, etc. Add it all up and it's generally around 20%. [This](https://www.ethz.ch/en/the-eth-zurich/welcome-center/services-and-downloads/salary-calculator.html) and [this](http://www.lohncomputer.ch/en/your-score.html?reference=gehaltsliste-en) seem to include everything. A 10K a month gross salary will leave you with roughly 8K net. You can add yourself ~350 for childcare benefits though.

- Rent is 3K, easily, for 100m2 and 3 bedrooms, unless you're really lucky. It doesn't get cheaper when you go *farther away*, it only gets cheaper when you are a *longer commute* away. And then your savings may be lost on having to get a car and spending 1 hour commuting. The north side of the lake has an excellent train service, so you can easily live for example in Nyon or Rolle. But, again, these aren't that cheap either, and neither is the train. The south side is cheaper, but your commute could be over an hour each way.

- Food, I've budgeted 1.5K-2K, but I've got a family of four and an unhealthy appetite...you can get a feel for prices at sites like coopathome.ch.

- Health insurance will be around 700-800 for you (see comparis.ch).
Then add on utilities, bills, transport costs, surprise expenses, fees and fines (Swiss are good at this, I hear), yearly insurance deductions, and it doesn't leave a lot. Personally, I'd say it's quite tight for Geneva, but that's hugely subjective and dependent on how much you expect to save, travel, what you do for fun, etc. 

Honestly I wouldn't **personally** be looking for a 3-bedroom place if you only have one small child. It's just too limiting. You can always move later, after you've settled in and had more time to look and research and learn the neighborhoods and traffic patterns etc, and give yourself time to wait for the perfect home to appear in the perfect place. A spacious 1-bedroom (like with an alcove or ""office"" that doesn't count as a room) might be a perfectly comfortable option, depending on the floor plan.

On a couple other points:

France: from what I've found out so far, it's not really financially worth it in most cases anymore. You pay a ~7% healthcare tax to France now, and rents aren't that much lower. If you're saving at all, you may lose it if you then need a car. You'll possibly have a horrid commute, too. Also, it seems to me that most of the nearby options in France are quite rural and/or residential. Some people like that, others don't... I'm oversimplifying, and it's not all like that, but I don't hear many people telling me how great Annemasse is, either.
Personally I'm slightly wary of being a frontalier due to the recent referendum business. Assuming you're looking to settle long-term like me, I'd rather work on a proper residence permit. I'm sure it'll all get sorted out as it's way too big a deal for the swiss economy to make any drastic moves, but then again you never know.

Finding housing: Everyone tells me it's a nightmare. I'm going to try using an agency, but mentally preparing myself that I might just have to live in an aparthotel (or airbnb) for even months. But then again I hear people saying they got something lovely almost immediately, so who knows. PS, it appears like you can avoid the enormous up-front cost of the 3-month deposit with services like swisscaution.
