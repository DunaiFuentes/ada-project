ARD10 would be better off for actual rescue and hostage missions (like the one planned for libya), and not only for swiss citizens abroad, but also in all of switzerland. we would not have to rely upon foreign forces if anything should happen in geneva, for example.

to give the soldiers the field experience needed i am sure the OSCE or UN offers this or that opportunity. the IKRK staff would also be happy if they could call in help in case they need it.

true,whitepalms85,null,null,"I don't see how the Gripen could possibly make Switzerland saver in any scenario unless you come up with really absurd stuff (e.g. Austria trying to conquer Switzerland or so). The biggest military power around us is NATO and we're friends with them. I know a lot of Swiss love their slightly ignorant neutrality fantasies but the reality is that the NATO is actually protecting us (and not our army... ) because they wouldn't tolerate it that another country (e.g. Russia, or a North African country) crosses their territory to attack us. Seriously, we're probably saver than some actual NATO member that have borders with Russia. It's not that Putin doesn't want to invade Switzerland because he's so scared of our army but because we're in the middle of NATO territory.

However, if you're concerned with our safety or our future friendship with NATO than you should actually support NATO membership. This is kind of the irony here. NATO membership would actually mean higher military spending and higher safety. You would expect that the right wing parties support this but because of the whole neutrality thing they're supporting some weird kind of cold war fantasy army that is completely useless and a pure waste of money (the argument that the Gripen is cheap doesn't make any sense. It's like telling you that burning CHF 10 is not a lot of money and that's why you should do it).

&gt;   if we abolish all our defenses.

Nobody really wants that. I just want see all the useless stuff abolished (fighter jets, Milizarmee...). There's nothing wrong with anti-terror units or safety against hackers or so. Also you're making the assumption that we can't get things back once we abolish them and that technology isn't changing. But we might decide in 20 years to buy something for our safety that isn't even invented today to fight a threat that we don't even think of right now. So how would it help to buy something now if we don't even know what we want to fight with it?",0,1399253489,null,0,1399253834,0,ch9p8d1,t3_24pjg2,t1_ch9p8d1,t1_ch9j4s8,null,1433653292,7,false,Switzerland,t5_2qhp6,7
