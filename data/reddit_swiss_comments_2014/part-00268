This is not the case in Switzerland. We have a parliamentary service which helps with the proceedings, but parliamentarians do not have any personal aids generally. We could obviously change that, but this is already a huge difference to the Athenian system. Athens did not have any representatives, all things were decided by all the people who were able to attend the assembly. 

But I still don't think that this would really help, because then you would have a lot of parliamentarians who would just do what their aids tell them is best. And interest groups would try to get their people into such a position in order to lobby for their interest.

&gt;I'm honestly not sure why you think the article was atrocious. 

Mainly because it is clearly written with a libertarian agenda and uses a lot of words which make no sense in the context of Ancient Athens. 

First the title. We have a very clear idea what a constitution is, however the Athenians did not know such a thing. The title suggests something already which simply isn't accurate. There was no piece of paper that was the highest body of law, within a nation state.

Which brings me to nation and Greek. Nation-states are an invention of the 19th century and Hellenism/Greek identity was only created after the city-states were united by Alexander the Great.

The idea of a free market is again an idea of the 19th/20th century. Athens was a hegemonic maritime trade empire with various colonies, but there was no capitalism. Calling it a free trade market again suggests things that are not true or inaccurate. 

And then the article makes out the three branches of government common in today's  democracy. Completely ignoring again that this is also an invention of a much later date and it simply makes no sense to make these distinctions, as they are inaccurate at best, but mostly not true at all. The Athenians simply did not have these ideas like that.

true,markus_b,vd,Vaud,"In the short term, yes.

However, if the united nations eventually get its act together and starts to have an international (police/military) force, then I can see Switzerland participating. Even if this force will use military action against foes.

I don't see this happening anytime soon, as there are too many countries having an agenda which would pit it against such an united nations force (Russia in Crimea and Ukraine, China in the south China Sea, etc).",0,1410527150,null,0,false,0,ckg8eh8,t3_2g6qqk,t1_ckg8eh8,t1_ckg86zv,null,1427053311,6,false,Switzerland,t5_2qhp6,6

Honestly, I think this is a really - really - fragile issue. This is not Al-Qaeda, which are hidden in the Afghanistan mountains or whatever. ISIS are everywhere, inside our communities, all around the world, especially in the West... This might be a really problematic situation thats why I agree with being neutral - if things escalate to a point where you have to take a stand, then yes, destroy those cunts.",0,1410527775,null,0,false,0,ckg8mfp,t3_2g6qqk,t1_ckg8mfp,t1_ckg73jx,null,1427053208,4,false,Switzerland,t5_2qhp6,4

true,cubicron,tg,Thurgau,"Nice to see that you like our political system. It might be a bit technical and inefficient for some, because we don't vote representatives, but it makes sure that everyone has the right to vote and express his opinion instead of voting representatives who make false promises and are sponsored from companies etc.
I think the others here explained it very well. But I fear that soon there will be no more national initiatives or ""Volksinitiative"" or "" initiative nationale"" or ""iniziativa nazionale"", because the european union makes pressure on our country and parties want to join the EU, which means that we would have to change a lot in our political system  for example our national initiatives.
