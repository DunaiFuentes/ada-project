Everybody goes to school and language education is way more successful than in neighbouring countries that also start with a foreign language (english) in primary school and continue in all schools after and yet fail in making students proficient. 

I understand why secondary or tertiary education may be ranked badly: the ranking is biased towards the american school system where high schools teach general stuff and they have to do at least 2 years of college to become various sorts of technicians, and also high school ends one year earlier so it's even more normal to do something after it. While the swiss one is an education system where mostly people who can make something with the degree actually go to university while the others can learn professions in secondary school already and don't need any tertiary education to get a job if they don't want to.
