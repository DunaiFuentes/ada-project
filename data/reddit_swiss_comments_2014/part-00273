true,chromopila,zh,Zürich,"I imported a handgun(actually 3 at once) this year. I already lived in Switzerland when I imported it, so it might be a little different to your case. I hope it's helpful anyway.

The first steps were identical to buying a gun inside Switzerland.

*  I had to acquire a background check(20CHF at the local post office, and they gave me glass of spaghetti sauce with it for free. No idea why).


* With said background check I was able to get a Waffenerwerbsschein(WES, weapon acquierement permit) for 50CHF

Here starts the additional hassle:


* I sent the WES with a filled copy of the ""Gesuch um nicht gewerbsmässiges Verbringen von Waffen""(application for non-profesional import of firearms) to the fedpol(federal police) which cost another 50CHF

* The dealer I bought my guns from did the whole tax stuff, that's why I don't really know how that part works. The essence is that I had a little discount because the dealer did not have to pay VAT, but then again I had to pay a little extra because of Swiss VAT. IIRC this added a little to the price, but not by a big margin.

* Then I had to bring my guns to my LGS where they got an import number engraved. This costs 100-200CHF per firearm according to fedpol(I got a considerable discount because I brought 3 at once).

The last port is **very** important. If you have a gun that went through customs more than 30 days ago and has no import number, the police can and will take your gun away.

&gt; For aerosols, however, the net effect of increase in density is to reduce the surface temperature of Earth. 

The talk here is about a negative correlation of CO2 and temperature between the forties and the seventies. The causal part related to cooling discussed here are the aerosols and not CO2. I don't see a problem with that at all - cars back then used to blast out more aerosols (no diesel particulate filter; fuel containing more sulfur) which are well known to have a cooling effect and have even been [proposed as means to mitigate/control the effects of greenhouse gases.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_engineering#Solar_radiation_management)

The problem here is of course that the aerosols tend to be removed (gravity, rain) from the atmosphere faster than CO2 (plants, acidification of water bodies) and with the introduction of diesel particulate filter and low-sulfur fuel, the ratio of aerosols exhaust vs CO2 exhaust shifted towards CO2. The CO2 mostly remained in the atmosphere while the aerosols came back down.
