We often use blue cheese (mainly stilton) and gorgonzola or something even creamier (e.g. ricotta) - either on its own or in addition to another cheese.  For extra win, you can put in bacon strips, pineapple, ham, shallots, apple slices and, well, fuck it, anything.

Just try to make sure the cheese you use isn't either too heavily aged or pasteurized, the consistency is nicer and it melts better.

Yeah, we eat a lot of cheese.

On the first occasion, I was sitting there with a couple of friends, drinking a beer in peace when one of the security guards walks up to me and asks for my ID. I was 21 at the time but some say that I still have a babyface going on, so getting ID'd isn't anything unusual. Keep in mind that I was having my very first beer, so I was nowhere near drunk and even when I am drunk, I don't tend to get loud or obnoxious. So this guys checks me out and says that he does not recognise my ID. I tell him that it's a typical ID from Luxembourg.. Keep in mind that I am in no way mocking him or acting douchy-drunk.

He nods and mumbles ""I see..."" and then asks if I have some other form of verification. I show him my driver's license and the ""Permis B"". He then tells me that I should get out and that since he doesn't know the ID, I have no right of being there. I was unsure if he was serious or not, so I asked him what was going on and why I was being thrown out. ""Is it because I'm from Luxembourg?"" to which he replied:""That's one way to put it."" You see the ads ""reinforce the SWISS family"" and ""protect yourself against the European virus"", but that was the one time where I felt openly discriminated in Switzerland.

The ID I'm referring to has watermarks, is plasticized and is looking as real as it gets. It's not like I'm from some obscure country, that a security guard has never heard of. Granted, I AM from a small country, but it's still in the EU. Plus he took a look at my Permis B, which is from Switzerland after all. Well, I'll most likely never set foot in there again. I didn't make any trouble, I just left - after all, what else was I to do?
