1) If you do not get lots of coins back, look for a business traveler that regularly flys over to UK. You take the Swiss coins and pay the pound to your customers and you ""sell"" the Swiss coins to the traveler.

2) If you have a larger volume of coins, for example when your business goes through the roof, check with a transport company for valuable goods (e.g [VIAMAT](http://www.viamat.ch/viamat/index.php?navid=2) ). And of course a business partner in Switzerland.

My biggest concern is that I don't seem to grasp some explanations given to me which are meant to be serious (I try to ignore the crackpots). I don't seem to grasp stuff and that bothers me.



&gt; commenting on ""printing money"" in a few threats now and I'm not really sure you understand what it means, as you seem to describe it as adding zeros somewhere on the asset side of their balance sheets.

Just a technicality, but I've started making a distinction between ""printing money"" and ""inventing money"". I've heard that printed money has to be backed up with 40% gold in Switzerland, and balance sheet magic money currently has to be backed by nothing (for all intents and purposes), that's why the distinction is necessary. Please could you tell me that it is not ""just adding zeros"" and elaborate on what it is?
I'm very much concerned with exactly this point, because the Billanz of the SNB has increased to a factor 5 and I don't know how this will affect us in the future. Do we need to scale this down again? In what timeframe?



&gt;  ""You gonna lose your job."" is not a cheap cop-out, but the end result of a complicated discussion about economics. The end result for non-economists.
&gt;
&gt; I gotta agree, that I usually don't like the threats of economists either, but with the gold initiative it's pretty obvious that it's not an empty threat.

This is a fairly standard argument I hear very often. You say that ""with the gold initiative it's pretty obvious that it's not an empty threat"". Could you also make it obvious for me (a non-economist)? Why is it obvious to you? For me the only thing I understand about the job-losing is the thing which concerns recession. This is agreed to be currently very much dependent on buying shitloads of Euros, and I accept that. But the gold initiative is almost independent of the Euro pegging, is it not? The only dependence between Gold Initiative and Euro pegging is that we cannot buy umlimited supply of Euros but need to have 20 Euro gold for every 100 Euro we buy. This immediately brings me back to my question: Do we just invent the money (the money we use to buy Euros)?




&gt; Money is basically just negative debt or the promise that debt is payed back after a certain time frame. Money supply is controlled by interest rates that incentivize how much credit/debt everybody gets.
&gt;
&gt; That's how money is created: By causing more people to owe you more by increasing interest rates.

That seems to answer my question about ""inventing money"", but I don't understand it.



&gt; negative debt or the promise that debt is payed back

debt from who? to who? payed back by what?



&gt; after a certain time frame

Have you heard any word in the discussions about Gold Initiative or Euro pegging about the time frame the Euros will be payed back? I heard the SNB guy saying that will do ""unlimitedly [unbeschränkt]"" whatever it takes to buy them Euros. I don't like it if this ""unbeschränkt"" refers to a perpetual time frame.



&gt;  That's also by the way why in early day banking interest rates were heavily disputed.

Inflation and non-gold backed money has also heavily been disputed. I like disputes, it gives me something to think about.



&gt; Anyway, what the gold initiative will do is bind the SNBs hands

I fail to see why this is a bad thing. First of all the SNBs hands are bound by the current constitution. Secondly, the GI will bind its hands in the sense that for every 100 Euro we buy we will have to *have* 20 Euro of gold. (I am deliberately not saying ""will have to *buy* 20 Euro worth of gold"", because this is not what the GI says but rather a consequence of it.) This is heavily dependent on the question whether the SNB is allowed to invent money or not.



&gt;  which you clearly seem to be for

If the SNB is allowed to say ""we will now invent one trillion trillion trillion CHF to pay everybody everything"" then I am clearly for a binding of their hands. (Note that I said ""if"").



&gt;  even though it only has to do with imaginary numbers that don't directly effect you

I like the term ""invented magic numbers"". Not because ""imaginary numbers"" has mathematical meaning, but because of the following: We *invent* the numbers, but we *imagine* that everything is okay and we have that money to buy stuff. If I may ask an extreme question: why doesn't the SNB invent new money and we all imagine that our national debt is gone?
Please note that I have never said that the invented money will not affect me. It will affect me, of course, because the monetary policy and economy of the country affects my life in the country. I don't care much about astrology, either. But when the long-term future of a country starts depending of Saturn being in the house of the lion when the moon is full during the rising of the scorpion, then I start questioning this stuff and think about how we wan't to foolproof this system. I'm not saying that economy is like astrology, but economy is no hard science either.



&gt; It will also create a guaranteed buyer of gold on the market, which basically makes the SNB the victim of speculators.

I hear this argument a lot. I could elaborate more on this, but let's stick to the following question: Why isn't this reasoning not valid with the pegging of CHf to the Euro? Note that the pegging is ""binding the SNBs hands"". Are there no Euro speculators?



&gt;  Also I question if the gold price is really as stable as everybody says it is

I don't care what ""everybody"" says. I like to stick to facts. Fact is: Gold has never gone down to zero. Fact is: Money has gone down to zero.



&gt; Also the value of our money comes down to trust. Trust that we can pay our bills. [...]  How the hell are people going to trust a currency that is backed by gold that cannot be touched.

How are people going to believe that somebody is well off during a crisis if he has a mortgage free land with a house, but cannot sell it because he lives in the house?



&gt; Is it really backed by gold if the gold can't be used?

I can't be *sold* during normal times. It needs Notrecht to sell it. I *can* be used, e.g. to increase our trust, or to print new money which says ""I promise we can cover this"".",0,1416739566,null,0,false,0,cmajyam,t3_2n0xqx,t1_cmajyam,t1_cm9qnp6,null,1425884394,1,false,Switzerland,t5_2qhp6,1

All I said was give it a break, and if you like down vote the topic. Because a) reporting such things feels like 10yo in primary school running to the teacher for nothing and b) you don't have to read it just because it's on the internet. I have read in this subreddit many stupid posts - some of which are questionable for our image - go reporting those please.

And by the way, if I post something stupid to r/unitedkingdom I would also hope to get a serious answer or at least a comment where to find my answers.
