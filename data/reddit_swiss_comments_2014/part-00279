On the other hand, you get what you pay for in terms of quality, so maybe a souvenir that lasts a lifetime is worth the extra price.

As for chocolate, you can find a nice assortment in every supermarket. While they might not be the top gourmet variety they'll still be enjoyed back home, that's for sure. Some of the brands you might want to look for, listed in increasing price and quality (approximation on my part) are: Frey, Cailler and Lindt.

Regarding coloured pencils, [Caran d'Ache](http://www.carandache.com/en) is without a doubt the most famous producer, though once again they won't be very cheap because of the high quality. They also have really nice pens as well, as well as other writing utensils.

I haven't really heard much about soap. I'm sure you could find some somewhere, but it isn't really something ""traditionally"" Swiss in that regard.
