At the moment my biggest hurdle is the language, I know that without it working is more or less out of the question. I am looking into studying a masters degree at a Swiss university which would give me time enough to practice the language and increase the possibility of getting a job.

Why Switzerland?  
Moving to Europe has been something I have been thinking about for a few years and I have always wanted to learn German, for no particular reason.   I feel like now is a good time to do it seeing as I am still young, not tied down by anything. Earlier this year I stayed in Zurich with a friend and was able to experience for a brief period what life in Switzerland is like.   I enjoy the outdoors and being active, after experiencing hiking in the Alps and spending a day by a lake on a warm day I was blown away.  Also the fact that Switzerland is so close to everywhere else in Europe, for an Australian from Perth, that is something that will never get old. Oh and there is also a girl...the friend I stayed with in Zurich.   That is not the only reason I want to move but is undoubtedly a factor ;)
