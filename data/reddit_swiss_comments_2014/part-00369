Well do what you want but you get what you pay for. Good people can earn high salaries so they take the jobs that pay such salaries. If you pay below market rate, you get below market quality. The current salary is absurdly low.

&gt; Our lack of respect for academic degrees and the fact that you can have an excellent career in this country without being a university graduate is another of the things that makes it great. 

But we're not talking about the economy as a whole here. Yes, it makes more sense that certain jobs have a more applied education instead of everyone studying at the university for no reason but that's certainly not true for Federal Counsels. That's not a plumbing job, you should be extremely smart and very well educated.

That makes absolutely no sense. These people are still idiots. Just because there are enough idiots to vote for them doesn't proof anything, rather the opposite actually. It's absurd to have such people in charge just so that other people that never went to university can feel good. Seriously, nowadays not studying just means you're lazy. You can study part-time, there's all kind of education, deciding to stay uneducated is a choice and it's not a good one.

&gt; Our lack of respect for academic degrees

Well, I rather have lack of respect of lazy people such as people that were too lazy for education and now have to blame the others to feel better. It's also called ignorance.

Now, and perhaps surprisingly considering this menial paycheck, we haven't this far had any problems finding people who are willing to do the job.

What links all of my four examples together was that they knew that money does not grow on trees and needs to be managed carefully. It's tempting to stray from this if you think it isn't yours. But it is, in the most direct sense imaginable, and I am under the impression that most of them remember that. Maurer being a CPA by profession probably doesn't hurt.

I am of course not assuming that every Federal Councillor is smart -- in fact, quite a few of them were idiots of the highest order. My point is that whether or not they are has no correlation with their academic credentials.
