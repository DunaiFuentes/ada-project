true,P1r4nha,zh,Zürich,"The parliament of the city of Winterthur has decided on Monday to participate in an experiment with other cities to temporarily legalize the consumption of Marijuana.

It's yet unclear if a city can decide that for itself due to national anti-drug laws. That and health concerns were the main arguments against the decision by a big, right-wing minority. CVP politician is quoted: ""Cannabis consumption, doesn't just give you a buzz, but can cause mental diseases like schizophrenia.""

Pro arguments were the research value since smoking pot is as widespread as drinking and also that prevention and education on its consumptions are made impossible with its illegality. SP politician calls the participation in the project ""an opportunity"".

The Pirate Party has brought up the issue and the Green Libertarians were the deciding faction. The decision was accepted by a difference of just one vote.

The project was originally initiated by the city of Geneva. Other participants will be Bern, Basel and Zürich. They will legalize cannabis consumption for three years, selling the drug in government certified Cannabis-Clubs. They hope to make the black market disappear and control consumption [*that's probably where education and prevention come at play*].

Zürich has already decided on that last year and is now trying to reach out to other cities and asks them to participate in the experiment as well.",0,1395220336,null,0,false,0,cg6df8z,t3_20r303,t1_cg6df8z,t1_cg6ctad,null,1432972749,8,false,Switzerland,t5_2qhp6,8

I can understand that this may be a hard to swallow pill for opponents who fought hard for about a decade now, but it's a more sane approach to reality which is ""Everybody who wants to smoke pot can and will smoke pot"".

I don't think their reason for coming that conclusion is THAT idiotic when you think about it. Switzerland has around 8 million people at the moment.
