&gt;  So employers in Germany and Switzerland don't have any right to turn away a headscarf wearing woman if she has the proper qualifications?

No for Germany. Though the law has exceptions for discriminatory behavior by religious organisations. E.g. a mosque does not have to employ a catholic.

But let's be real: Any private employer in the world can turn away anybody if they claim ""not to feel the right team fit"", because you cannot prove otherwise. Public employment relies much more on tests and measurable assessments of qualifications because it has to show the public objectivity and prevent favorism and nepotism.
