To me if I have to show someone a few key places that will really show them what Switzerland is all about, I'd choose the following:

- Zermatt. Top 3 best ski resorts in the World, and you definitely want to go see the Matterhorn. Magical little town, it really is.

- Geneva. Very international, very beautiful City built around the end of the Lake with the iconic Jet D'eau. Close to loads of cool mountain spots.

-http://goo.gl/JM9Rm9 . If you're in the Geneva region, visit this little place. One of my favorite, kind of secret, locations. It's a really nice little restaurant in a valley just under La Dole (looks like a big white ball on the mountain), which you can hike to from the restaurant in about 25 minutes up, and 25 minutes back down to the restaurant. Seriously breathtaking views, with cows and mountain goats, and just nature at its best.

Ticino. Warmest part of Switzerland, and it shows the cultural diversity.

In my opinion the german part of Switzerland is a bit less exciting (Zermatt is originally swiss german but very international), and for a foreigner I bet you'd enjoy the region around Geneva a bit more. 

If you can only pick idk like 3 cantons to visit: My pick would be Valais (outdoors stuff/wine), Geneva (city/airport), Vaud (beautiful lake, mountains, nice cities.
