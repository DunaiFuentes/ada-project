Most people that like gold are ultra pessimists that keep telling you that 'soon' the system will fall apart and then gold will be the only 'real' thing because money is 'just paper'.

1. So far they have been wrong all the time, sure some countries defaulted but the entire system never collapsed.

These people are like all these gurus and cults that keep telling there followers that 'the end is near' but then it never really happens.

2. Even if they were right and the entire system would collapse then gold would be useless. In such an extreme scenario you need guns, canned food and fuel but certainly not gold. You can't eat gold, you can't defend yourself with it, it does nothing and it's heavy so even difficult to transport. 

3. Like the 'worthless paper money' gold has absolutely no value (or at least close to no value). There's almost no use for gold in reality. The only reason why people buy it is because it's shiny and rare. It's just some hunter and gatherer reflex in our brain that we think that we need to keep such things but it makes no sense. Obviously now we have this entire culture around it (e.g. jewelry) but that will be totally useless when the system collapses because demand for that will collapse too.

I would not venture to say that the low interest rates are the cause of the high dept, but the low rates are certainly not helping. Also, because of the low inflation, many traditional policy tools for central banks are ineffective. You can not go below zero percent, some countries (Sweden) are almost in deflation.

&gt; I have never actually received an education of how the depression looked in Switzerland. I am vaguely familiar with the inflation of the Weimer republic. and vaguely familiar with Austria's more fiscally conservative approach to handling its war reparations. What is an interesting discussion for me, is whether destroying the currency to get rid of the war reparations in one fail swoop was better long term for Germany, than having to pay interest off but keeping the currency strong, such as what the Austria did. Do you have any thoughts or insights?

The excessive war reparations after WW1 were probably one big cause of WW2. I'm not sufficiently familiar with it to argue about it. In Switzerland the effects were not as catastrophic as in Germany.
