The reasoning being that for the off chance that the international financial system will collapse next year, we will have a solid but limited currency which will allow the international financial markets to park their money. If the international financial markets will not collapse in the near future, but later, we will shackle down our export industry with a hugely overpriced currency. We then will have a solid currency and no economy to work with it.

He makes it sound like the central bank steals our gold. They sold the gold, sure, maybe not for the best price, but we win when the central bank makes profit and it consistently made profits.

He believes that Keynesian economics is wrong. He's probably a proponent of the Austrian School of economics. That's what I dislike most about economics: There are too many ideologues. The whole debate around economic systems is like a religious debate between Christians and Muslims.. the truth is probably not found with either of them.  
I don't care what he believes or doesn't believe. Are his suspicions backed by facts?

He also obviously tries to make the current, stable situation sound bad. We already have one of the highest valued currencies. Despite the last few years Swiss Francs are still extremely popular and people park their assets in the Swiss Franc. Why do you think it's still so stable despite being increased that much? It's because everybody buys it to a high price. The trust in the Swiss economy is undeterred, so what is he talking about?  
So the record low unemployment will sink even more? We gonna profit financially? How? We're already filthy rich compared to everybody else around you.

First two years are not really concrete. Basically  you do a lot of general science: math, chemistry, physics, material science, whatever. It is very useful because it allows you to see the big pictures in projects, which is really useful for the next years.

In 3rd year you really start doing a lot of engineering courses: you have almost no fundamental classes anymore, and everything revolves around engineering, but still very broad : nanotechnologies, manufacturing processes, robotics and various forms of signal processing. The biggest (and most intense) course of the year is product engineering : you will create one product end to end, starting with the idea and market size estimations and ending with the manufacturing cost and process. This is one of the most interesting course I have taken, but it doesn't have a formal structure : the professors want to give you engineering **feeling** not engineering knowledge.

I have only graduated my Bsc and I now I am pausing my studies for military duty, so for the Master I only know from discussion with others. Basically you have 4 different orientations : robotics, optics, nanotechnologies and manufacturing. Manufacturing and robotics are pretty close, and there you can do a lot of different things, from control theory to mechanical engineering, depending on your courses and projects. I ran away from nanotechnologies because 3rd year courses were boring as hell and optics graduate do a lot of physics and theory and usually end up in management positions.

If you want a good idea of what we do, you can look here : http://sti.epfl.ch/page-1683-en.html Look at the bachelor 5 and 6 collumns, they are 3rd year courses and the most concrete stuff.

As for the EE -&gt; CS migration I would say it is totally doable if you do not plan to write very algorithmic software such as databases or crypto. If you plan to write control software, for robot arms for example EE would actually be a better choice.

For me, the high-level difference is quite simple: CS look at how a computer works by itself, and syscom looks at how computers work together. This is of course an oversimplification, but bear with me ;).

In CS, you will learn about the inner working of a computer, starting from its hardware (with courses such as Logic Systems and Computer architecture) and going up the ""stack"" toward software (though courses like Operating Systems, Compiler construction, and Software Engineering). You will have a deep understanding of algorithms, software development, as well as more theoretical stuff like logic.

In syscom, you will learn about communications, and all the tools that they require. This will start at a quite low level, with courses such as electromagnetism, principles of digital communications, and advanced math/probabilities courses. Then, you will be able to push further in some directions such as cryptography, signal processing, networks (both at the physical and logical levels).

I guess the main difference between the two is math: a CS student will have fewer math-oriented courses, and will not be very familiar with probabilities. On the contrary, a syscom student will have a strong math background, and be used to working with randomness. However, it is not uncommon to encounter a syscom student that hates coding (and sucks at it), while CS student will have a very strong programming background.

In the end, the way syscom was presented to me is a field at the intersection of CS, math and EE, and I couldn't agree more. How much weight you want to give to each of these aspects is up to you, for myself it was more CS and math. I really loved learning the mathematical tools that allow me to work with random quantities, and I feel that this strong math background prepared me well for the work I'm doing now (which involves data mining and machine learning, i.e., a lot of stats).

To conclude, as someone else already said, the first year is common anyways, and it is quite easy to move between the two sections, even aftewards (there a several common courses, and a lot of overlaps between the two programs). If during your CS studies, you find that you are lacking some math-oriented courses, it is quite easy to take some syscom courses (and the opposite is also true), or learn these on your own later if you need them. However, from my point of view, I'd rather take all the math courses while I'm at EPFL, and later/on the side practice my programming/software engineering on personal projects and student jobs. I find it much harder to learn theoretical stuff on my own, than to learn a new programming language or tool/algorithm.
