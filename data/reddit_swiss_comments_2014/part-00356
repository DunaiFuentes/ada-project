This might not be very mature, I agree, but I find it useless to discuss with people that see any contradicting evidence to their opinion as the result of a conspiracy.  
There is no evidence that votes in Switzerland get rigged and we had more important votes in the past, in my opinion. Hell, we have votes every few months some go totally against the recommendations of the government. This is routine to us. Anything weird would immediately be noticed.  
The claim that this initiative either has to be voted for or the system is broken is fatuous. And that's why I called them freaks, not because I don't like their opinion.

But giving you the benefit of the doubt: I think it's totally valid to discuss the different economic systems and the role of gold as a backing mechanism.  
Pegging our currency to the Euro makes it dependent on the European Union. With gold (or anything else) we would be less dependent, but since more than half of our exports go to European countries we're still dependent on how much they pay us and unfortunately we export more than we import so a high valued currency is costly for us.

This and the fact that the gold could never be sold except for an official [state of emergency (sorry, only in German)](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ausnahmezustand#Notrecht_in_der_Schweiz), is the Swiss perspective on this issue. It's not about a more abstract discussion if money actually has any value if it's not backed by something like gold etc.  
I live here and I observe the campaigns. The discussions are rarely on the abstract level, but tailored to the current state of Switzerland's economy and its dependency on Europe.

Also: The Swiss Franc is popular as ever. We haven't really noticed anything unusual here in Switzerland since the pegging. Quite the contrary. The crisis of 2008 has barely touched us and everything is normal and fine and dandy as ever. This is exactly the job of the central bank by the way: To keep our prices stable. And it seems to me that they succeeded in that. We can discuss their methods and if they couldn't have done that better, but I find it quite remarkable that we didn't get that many problems while half of Europe and most of the US is hurting.

Either that, or the Euro would have to dip below a given value.  Think of it this way - if the SNB's been buying a crapton of Euros at 1.2 (that's the rate, just looked it up) in exchange for gold that otherwise wouldn't be doing anything, and the Euro rises to, say, 1.3, they've just made a metric shitload of money.  

They don't _need_ more than a certain amount of Euros (as part of what are called foreign currency reserves - every healthy government should have some, for reasons like wanting a cushion against exchange rate fluctuations and economic downturn and being able to maintain balances of payment / debt servicing, etc.)

In terms of definition, it's related, but not entirely the same.  A peg sets a strict relationship between currency A and currency B.  The government usually will do this through the same mechanism the SNB uses (buying/selling on the open market).  A national bank can also just decree that ""the currency is worth XYZ of this other currency"", but that never works (black market arises fairly quickly).

Some pegs allow for a certain flexibility (plus/minus a few percent).  This is sort of a ""half peg"".  The SNB just doesn't want the CHF to rise above a certain value of EUR.  They don't care if it falls below.

At least, nobody I ever talked to, both when looking for jobs/internships and during my PhD, have ever looked at what my diploma says (except for the fact that it's MSc in syscom). We did not have the ""orientations"" to pick from in Bachelor, but I guess the optional courses we had were similar. I wouldn't really sweat it too much, and simply pick courses that look the most interesting. I have seen far too many people pick the easiest ones, or the ones where you knew you'd get a 6, and in my opinion it is the wrong way to go. You won't have the sort of teaching we have here later, so you should rather have a world-class expert teach you about complicated stuff like information theory, than some BS introductory class like biometrics.

You don't have so many choices in the first years, but the further you go, the more choices you have. I took a few options in the bachelor to see what looked interesting, and picked most of the classes oriented around randomness/machine learning during my master. I also think that projects are really the best way to dig into a subject, so I tried to do as many as I could (thus taking an optional semester project during the master instead of a class).

I liked the ""specific"" classes I took like Computer Vision, pattern classification and machine learning, because they gave me an overview of what these fields are about. However, the most important ones I took are more the basic ones (modèles stochastiques, information theory, models for random networks), as they gave me the foundations to be confortable dealing with the math behind a lot of tools. I even took some advanced probabilities classes at the beginning of my PhD. So to sum up, I would say that classes that give you good theoretical foundations are a must, and then projects! I wouldn't focus too munch on classes that focus too much on specifics, especially if it is related to programming, as things change often. I found that if you do many projects (also at home, for fun), your programming will get good enough that you don't need to take many CS-oriented classes. I am not saying that courses such as software engineering are useless, far from that, but that you'll learn the skills you need from the projects directly. I also tried to get as much industrial experience as I could, doing a 6-months internship at the beginning of my master, working the whole time on the side, and doing my master thesis in a research company in the US.

I realize I did not go into specifics, do not hesitate to ask more if you want!

Anyway, I'm not an economist either so I won't be able to use many expressions they use and my understanding is very reductionist and not very fancy. However I think I understand how the money supply works.

**On inventing money**

Turns out you're half right and I'm half wrong about this. It's possible for the central bank to just create money by adding numbers. However they don't often do this and it's not how the money supply is usually increased. What controls the money supply is the interest rate with which banks borrow money from the central bank.

They'll give you credit and want interest on that, so you have to pay them back more than you got. Also they have to pay back the central bank more than they got. That sounds troubling, but that's how you suddenly end up having more money in the system. If you look at money as negative debt that works. If you look at money as a finite physical commodity it doesn't.

Economists argue that this is fine, because by using the money you and all others borrow from the banks they create value and a thriving economy which leads to a more trusted currency. It also seems to invites inevitable inflation. That's not usually a problem though, because the money is a reflection of the value in the country and as long as value is created an increasing money supply just reflects that.

**On the vote causing a recession**

It's obvious to me because most economist say that the unofficial peg to the Euro will no longer be possible if we have to buy the corresponding value in gold. If the Franc skyrockets versus the Euro our export economy will be destroyed and that's quite a big chunk of what makes us so rich.  
I have to be honest though: I'm not totally convinced that we would have to stop buying Euros. If the price of gold goes up we wouldn't need to buy additional gold to back the Franc and could continue buying Euros. You already realized that however when saying that we ""have to buy 20 Euros gold"".  
But of course that would increase the balance sheet even more. And yes.. by inventing money.


**On the worth of money being dependent on trust**

If we look at money as negative debt as I explained above we have to look at what is debt in this case. Banks borrow money from the central bank, businesses or other private persons borrow money from banks. You get credit and are indebted with a certain interest. The money is basically a guarantee by the central bank that you will get your worth of that money. Most of the time they don't have to come clean on this promise however. People just believe it. They believe that the money has a certain worth and that's enough to validate it as a commodity to trade with. Physical money is either coins or paper. It could also be something else. It doesn't matter if you have cash in your hands or a number on your bank account. Both are worthless if the trust in the central bank disappears.  

This leads me to the problem of bubbles like the housing market bubbles in 2008 in the US. Banks (or rather those [GSE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government-sponsored_enterprise)) gave people credit to buy houses they couldn't afford. They created money by giving credit (giving credit is creating debt for somebody else and negative debt is money) which they would not get back, because the people who got indebted could not pay it back.  
And this is where the system becomes dangerous. Suddenly money exists that people are not so sure actually reflects anything of worth. The promise the banks make that this money and the value exists is dubious. They were able to make these promises because for some fucked up reason you can package mortgages into weird packages and bet against their worth. This is also where my knowledge of financing is reaching an end. For some reason the banks didn't care if that money could be paid back, because they would make more money by trading with the mortgages rather than the money actually being paid back.

So as soon as the trust disappears that some debt can be payed back by the person or institution who borrowed that money, you'll run into a problem with the worth of that money.

What it means for our situation is that the SNB trusts the Euro, otherwise they wouldn't buy it at a certain price. Is it dangerous when we have unconditional trust in the EU? I'd say yes, but you would probably have to look at the context the ""SNB guy"" said that. I'm sure there are exceptions, but none that are considered a possibility. They trust in the recovery of the Euro and that will make us a killing.

We certainly can sell the Euros again and if the value of the Euro is higher we'll be making a killing.

**On gold and its role as backing**

The argument is that gold will never be totally worthless. On the global market that's probably true. On an individual basis probably less so. You and I only like gold because we know what else we can get with it when we give it to somebody else. So it's the same as money... or any other commodity. Good about gold is, that it cannot go bad like food does over time. It's quite independent on many factors like weather and it cannot get damaged easily.  
That's quite a cool thing. Magic numbers (or whatever you want to call them) are almost the same. Our physical money also, except that paper bills can be burnt. The biggest difference is that the value of gold is also independent more or less on governments and their policies. When a region becomes independent, a government starts a war, countries get occupied i.e. any kind of governmental instability the worth of money is in danger, the worth of gold much less so. And I think that's what proponents of gold are motivated by. Their trust into governments is unusually low and many of them believe a crash is imminent either of the global economy or the governments on the global stage. Many of them are Libertarians who don't believe a government is even necessary anyway. No wonder a currency that is based on trust into government policies and the health of the economy cannot be trusted.

That is also why the Swiss Franc is so popular and consistently highly valued: Everybody trusts in our stability. The Swiss economy is a great place to make business. We're more free and less socialist than other countries and we grant a bit more freedoms. We don't care what the others are doing.. until recently. The international pressure to do business similarly like everybody else has increased. We can argue if that's fair. Is it fair that we basically helped everybody else in the world to evade their taxes? Obviously the governments who suspect us to have their citizen's money want us to change our policies. That's another reason why Libertarians like Switzerland: They don't believe in government so they don't want to pay taxes for it. Being able to evade taxes is even more awesome than for the average person, because it fits their world view.

Backing the Swiss Franc isn't generally a bad thing, but the price of gold also fluctuates. Also by having our gold around the world we can profit from its location relative to the trading partners. The initiative says that we need to store all our gold in Switzerland. It's another indication that they believe we cannot trust other governments and have to take care of ourselves.

I have to agree with you that my argumentation that binding the SNB's hands is a bad thing doesn't have to be generally true. It was a stupid thing to say and I was trying to make use of a liberal argument against government intervention. It's interesting that usually the liberal argumentation is that government shouldn't limit the free market, but it's okay now to limit the SNB in deciding how the currency should be backed. 

**The rest of your questions**

&gt;  Are there no Euro speculators?

Yes there are. Switzerland is one of the bigger ones, wouldn't you agree? It's a risky course to trust only one thing. Our assets are backed by all kind of things, including gold. The question is if we should limit the freedom of the central bank to decide on what is currently the best thing to be backed. If gold isn't a good idea we should be able to sell it. Same with Euros. I find it dangerous that we have to hold on to our gold until we're in a state of emergency. That goes against the task of the central bank to keep prices level.

&gt; How are people going to believe that somebody is well off during a crisis if he has a mortgage free land with a house, but cannot sell it because he lives in the house?

I'm not sure I understand this question. He can always decide and move out of the house? He doesn't have to wait for a state of emergency. It's enough to understand the current trend of his wealth.

**In conclusion**

I don't think gold in general is a bad thing to have as backing, but I don't think our current situation requires isolationist and conservative policies. Gold is also not magically awesome as other backings. It has its disadvantages as well. It's a solid investment either way, there are many worse things.  
I think I understand the motivations of the proponents, but I don't share them and that's why I'm against government intervention in this case. Mainly because of the question if buying Euros will still be possible which nobody was able to answer me convincingly. The possibility that it's not going to be possible and might cause a recession, one that the SNB was great at avoiding, is reason enough for me to be against the measure.
