of course its not really easy finding an apartement in Zürich directly, but if you are OK with travelling by train or bus for 20-30 minutes you will be perfectly fine.
As belgium is in schengen and is EFTA all you need to do is apply first and get a job.

You will not be able to do anything until you have a job. (or a fuckton of money)

The jobmarket in Zürich is huge, alone in IT there are 1200 available jobs. 
So if you are highly skilled you wont have a problem finding one (english sufficient).

Maybe after you have done your education do some extended vacation and get some interviews.

Here a few numbers for you:
Average yearly salary in CH: 70'000-80000CHF
Taxes: 10-15% income, 5% pension, 6.5% Social Security/Job Insurance
3 Room apartement in the ""proximity of ZH"" 2000-3000CHF/month
8 hours working days 8 to 5, 40 hours a week.
If you get a job from an EFTA country you will get 5y B permit, after extension (no crime record, not jobless) granted for C permit (permanent). Can apply for citizenship after 10y and proof of social integration and fluid language (german).",0,1404093723,null,0,1404094086,0,cikhv9t,t3_29exxq,t1_cikhv9t,t3_29exxq,null,1434469427,3,false,Switzerland,t5_2qhp6,3

A foreigner myself, living here for 8 years, wife a foreigner as well. Lived in Zurich for 5 years, with a medium-low income at first, it was a struggle. If you are lucky and get something in the lower price range (and we are still talking about 1500 CHF/month) you can't really expect much of it, you can really get into a shithole. *If* you get a flat in Zurich. In other cities you have the same picture. 

Work: In spite of having a comparable low unemployment rate, getting a job for foreigners is a lot more difficult. My wife has excellent qualifications, graduated from one of the top 10 business schools in Europe, speaks five languages, and spent over one year unemployed nonetheless (and she had to endure a lot of harassment on her job when she had one).

As others have pointed out, making friends here is very difficult. I struggled a lot with this. If I did not have my wife I don't know if I would have stayed.
