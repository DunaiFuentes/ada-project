2) Recognition. Some jobs/degrees need recognition to be accepted in Switzerland. Unfortunately yours is one of those. http://www.enic-naric.net/index.aspx?c=Switzerland
To get recognition you have to do a ton of procedures, from proving you are fluent in any of the official languages (Either B2 or C1 level, I don't remember), pay like 600 CHF and wait for them to approve it (it's not certain and it can take a while).

3) Being from outside of EU, it's really hard to get a permit to live and work here, unless you are given a job contract. So maybe you should work on that first.

Hard, but not impossible. Just depends how much you really want it.

I made a search for the following profile: healthcare industry, 8 years experience, 30 years old, education: apprenticeship (I think this is the same as cert. nurse assistant), job level: specialist, none managerial function.

Salary is between CHF 5600 and 6000 for that profile. That might sound high but it's median income in Switzerland. Cost of living is very high (e.g. CHF 1500-2000 for a two room flat in center of Zurich is quite common and not even considered to be expensive).

I agree with the other people that you will have to be fluent in at least one national language because you have to be able to communicate with the people you're taking care of (and older people usually don't speak English). It's not like Google or UBS where English is the official company language and they don't care whether you can speak a national language or not as everybody will understand you anyway.

However, maybe I'm wrong here because I don't work in the industry but as far as I'm aware it's quite common for foreigners to work in the health care industry. There's a lack of Swiss people with these skills and a relatively old population so Switzerland is basically importing health care worker (everything from assistants to doctors).

&gt;___Neospora caninum___ is a [coccidian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coccidia) [parasite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parasite) that was identified as a species in 1988. Prior to this, it was misclassified as *[Toxoplasma gondii](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxoplasma_gondii)* due to structural similarities.  The genome sequence of *Neospora caninum* has been determined by the [Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wellcome_Trust_Sanger_Institute) and the [University of Liverpool](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Liverpool).  *Neospora caninum* is an important cause of [spontaneous abortion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spontaneous_abortion) in infected [livestock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Livestock).
