true,chromopila,zh,Zürich,"Problem is you need a permit(Haltebewilligung) to have a crow or raven as a pet since they don't exist in a fully domesticated form. When you acquired your permit you need a big outside aviary which must be inspected by your local veterinary department. If you did this you are allowed to have a group of crows or ravens. You can't have just one, since they're social animals and keeping them without company is considered animal cruelty. As to where you can get some ""Auffangstationen für Wildvögel""(shelters for sick or abandoned wild birds) might be worth a try. They also can provide you with reliable information, what I wrote above is mostly based on hearsay since I never seriously considered owning a raven but do have a neighbour which has a seni-wild one. Be prepared for some bureaucratic hurdles to get and keep crows or ravens.


But before you put more time into your research let me tell you about the neighbour of mine and his bastard of crow:

We live in a fairly rural area, and next to his house is a meadow which had some old cherry trees on it. One fine day the farmer which owned said meadow decided to cut down the cherry trees, he proceeded to do so even after he was being harassed by crows, realising that they were attacking him because they had their nest in one of those trees only when he saw the nest from the cut down tree lying on the ground, he put the nest into on of the remaining trees hoping the crows would return. They didn't. This is where my neighbour felt pity and climbed up the tree and put the eggs in a electric breeder. After some time one little baby crow hatched and he coddled it up with a mixture of minced meat, grounded nuts and cream. The crow grow, and started to fuck shit up. One thing you might not know about crows is that they don't poop. They hold back until their bowels nearly explode only to squirt a huge load of putrid manure across the room onto everything you love. 

Crows are smart you say? That will make it easy to make them housebroken, right? Well fuck no. They use their smarts to shit when and where you don't expect them and take flight before you catch them. They also like to pull pages from books and it seems like they have a faible for shattering things. They are also very good at finding out which of your possessions you like and/or use most.

You like playing guitar? Do you think this varnish is harder than my beak?

You take this keys with you every time you leave the house? Not anymore!

As soon as the crow reached maturity he wanted to get it out of his house, leaving it to the wilderness. The crow left quite soon, but comes back every now and then invading his home when he leaves a door or window open and fucks some shit up for old time's sake

Crows are vicious bastards, and know more ways to ruin your day than you ever imagined.

There were two big, different reasons for which people voted no:

1) the left wing is mainly against too many expenditures for the army, so no wonder they voted no;

2) a protest against the selection procedure, for instance: they felt a Gripen was too cheap (probably, in this case, Ikea is bad a publicity for you...), was not good enough, ""was not the best and we have to have the best around"", was too ""bleeding edge"" technology and not tested enough, or that was not a guaranteed to work as intended.
