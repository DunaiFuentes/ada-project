I have to mobilize enough people to rally those 99'999 other people to give me their signature. It's almost certain there are 100'000 people in 7 million who have the same opinion as some other person. The hard part is to make the effort to find and meet them and ask them for a signature.

If you're able to do that it's probable that there are more people with that opinion in the population which makes a vote justified.

When was the last time only 0.14% people voted for an initiative?


Nevertheless, you are right to a certain extent: Parties like the SVP have a lot of resources to find people that agree with them, so for them it's easier than for some random dude. But their resources are of course due to a third of the country agreeing with them.
