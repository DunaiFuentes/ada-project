true,LypheIsGood,sg,St. Gallen,"Depending on what you want to experience there's a few things you can do. 

If you want to party, bars are usually open until midnight on weekdays and until 1am or 3am on the weekend. Clubs will be open longer (usually until around 4 or 5), although they have irregular opening hours on weekdays, so they won't be open, unless there's a special event. 

As for seeing some of the surroundings of St. Gallen: Lake Constance is not very far at ALL, and I'd definitely recommend taking a train to Rorschach or Romanshorn or Bregenz at least once and just look around a little bit. Trains start running pretty early (the first one probably around 6am), so that shouldn't be a problem. 
If it's really warm, you can also still hit up ""Drei Weiher"" which is the local place to go swimming and just chill out. You can either walk there or take the bus (I think it's either the 2 or the 8). You also have a great view, since it's on one of the hillsides. 

Other tourist attractions in/around St. Gallen are the monastery (if you like old churches, go see this and its library!) and the Säntis (a mountain, around 2500m high, you can get there by bus and then take a gondola up).
