And so there you provided one. I then read it thinking it was Swiss-German. But then you told me it was actually just Zurich Swiss-German, not normal Swiss-German. So then I asked why you provided a Zurich Swiss-German translation when he did not ask for something so specific. I then went on and said why [did you] not [provide just a normal] Swiss-German one. Or if anything, a Bernese one since his tag says he's from Bern, not Zurich.

edit:    
about that zurich-swiss-german-thing: That has something to do with the ""Kantönligeist"" where every swiss thinks, that his dialect is the real swiss-german. So if you ask a person from zurich to translate something into swiss-german, you'll automatically get a translation in zurich-swiss-german. which sounds alright for every citizen from zurich, but totally wrong for the rest of switzerland. 
the same happens, when you ask someone from bern or basel or valais. you'll always get an unique swiss-german for every region of switzerland.
