true,whitepalms85,null,null,"The official answer is ""where the center of your life is"" and that's usually considered to be the place where you live. But you can have a flat/room in one city/canton and pay taxes in another one but if you have a flat in your ""tax canton"" and if you can proof that the center of your life is in the ""tax canton"" and not the city/canton where you work and you rented your second flat. It's called a ""Wochenaufenthalter"". An example would be a family father from Lugano that works 2-4 days in Zurich and therefore rented a room as it would be too far to commute home everyday. But as his family lives in Lugano, he returns home almost every weekend as most of his friend, leisure activities and so on are there too. This would be very credible and easy to proof. Tax authorities are especially sensitive to the topic if claim to have the center of your life in some of the low tax cantons / municipality but work in one of the bigger cities with higher taxes. 

I remember an interesting news reports about some very old housing blocks in need of redevelopment with very small flats in some very low tax municipality. Just by looking at the house you would have expected that just the poorest people of our society live there but when the reports checked the names on the mail boxes, almost everyone had a Dr. title. None of the neighbors has seen people entering or leaving the house in a long time and half of the flat didn't even really have proper furniture.

true,xeribulos,sg,St. Gallen,"The first question to ask is if you are a Swiss Citizen or at least have the Niederlassungsbewilligung (permanent residency permit C). Because if you do not have either (that is, if you are foreign and only have a Aufenthaltsbewilligung (temporary stay permit B or L for example)) you will be taxed at source anyway. That means your employer will directly deduct the tax (at source) from your salary and transfer it to the according tax authority. As long as you do not have additional income (own business, freelance work) or a considerable fortune, in which case you would have to fill out the regular tax forms, you do not have to to anything yourself and will not have to pay any additional direct taxes.

For Swiss Citizen or Foreigners with Permit C, it is all about the Lebensmittelpunkt or Center of Life as others have already pointed out. It is usually assumed that the Lebensmittelpunkt is where your official place of residence (your home) is. Even for Wochenaufenthalter (those who have an appartment in another city/canton and only return home on weekends/holidays) this is true as well. However, there are actually quite specific quidelines about how often you would have to return home and such and still be eligible to be taxed by your home canton (and not by the work canton).

Now, it is not at all uncommon with (usually young and single) Wochenaufenthalter that they return home less and less (once every two weeks, once every month a.s.o.) but do not officially relocate their place of residence (especially if the tax canton has much lower taxes as the work canton). In this case, especially if you have a high enough income and fit this potential category, the tax authorities (of the work canton) might actually investigate and ask you to verify that your Lebensmittelpunkt is where you say it is. If you fail to prove this (according to the guidelines mentioned above), they can force the tax canton to relinquish fiscal jurisdiction to them and tax you accordingly.",0,1395838318,null,0,false,0,cgcb9in,t3_21cn7q,t1_cgcb9in,t3_21cn7q,null,1433075354,2,false,Switzerland,t5_2qhp6,2
