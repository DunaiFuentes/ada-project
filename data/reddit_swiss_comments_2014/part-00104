I'm waiting for a pun or something like that because pretty much every country recommends having a emergency kit with food and so on at home.

Im not sure about how the Swiss enjoy things, but if you are visiting in Geneva, (they are practically French), or hell, the rest of switzerland anyway.

I would substitute beef jerky for peanut butter. PB is expensive and uncommon in Europe. If you bring a 40oz tub in your luggage their eyes will go wild with the prospect of having that much in one place at one time.  You will blow their Swiss minds.
