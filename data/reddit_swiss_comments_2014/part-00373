false,therealsam,usa,USA,"No direct experience, but my boss imported his car from CA to Switzerland no problem. You get one year to do it (and any other moving-related stuff, iirc). A CA car shouldn't need to be modified significantly because the smog and safety standards are the highest in the world! You may need to have the electronics changed a bit (e.g., when the parking lights on cars come on), but nothing major.

If the car is like the rest of the ""importing for moving"" rules, you need to own it for some time period (either 6 months or a year) for it to count under this tax-free thing.

I wanted to take my car to CH with me (from Calif.), but a tuned WRX uses a crapload of gas (plus parts are hella pricey!).

false,Kapensteijn,ag,Aargau,"My boss imported a new Ford Mustang a couple years ago. He told me it was quite a hassle. Moving it across the pond is one thing, but if you're moving anyway probably no too difficult. Then it has to be approved by the Strassenverkehrsamt (DMV). Depending on the canton this examination may be incredibly, or just very thorough. Also depends on the age of the car. Expect to pay a hefty fee everywhere. (approximately 1000-2000CHF) 

I would only make the effort for a high-end car that's less than 3 years old with low mileage. Otherwise there's a chance the Strassenverkehrsamt doesn't allow it in the first place without even looking.

I don't know the price differences between US and Swiss cars, but I'd expect you'd have to reserve at least 5000CHF for the entire operation. Also consider resale value in Europe.

I moved to Switzerland last year, and also looked to import my car. Decided not to do it because it was too old. You do need to have it for at least 6 months in order to not pay additional taxes. All the forms and requirements on the internet can be a bit overwhelming, so I'd also advise to call a Strassenverkehrsamt if you really want to make sure everything goes as planned.",0,1418250917,null,0,false,0,cmr83jw,t3_2owo3f,t1_cmr83jw,t3_2owo3f,null,1425496857,5,false,Switzerland,t5_2qhp6,5
false,knpee,null,null,"I did exactly this (also from California) last July. The best thing you can do is hire a professional shipping company who will handle the logistics and customs for you (around $3000). The key to being able to bring the car in without paying customs or taxes is to do it as ""Übersiedlungsgut,"" meaning you need to have owned the car for at least 6 months in the US, and you are shipping it to Switzerland along with all your other possessions as part of the move. You are correct that you can not sell the car for 12 months after bringing it to Switzerland (technically you can, but then you get hit with the customs and taxes).

Once the car is here it needs to go trough inspection before you can get it registered and insured. If you are talking about a newish car, the general rule is that if it has stock parts and meets EU norms it should pass inspection just fine. The two main things you'll likely run into here is that your US car might have yellow daylight running lights, which are not allowed in Switzerland. If your car has Xenon lamps you'll also need a washing system. Apparently the US is one of the only places where these things aren't mandatory, so you may very likely need to get one installed. I had to on my car (even though it was a German car), which cost somewhere around 1500 CHF.

All in all bringing my car over was a lot more work than I expected.
