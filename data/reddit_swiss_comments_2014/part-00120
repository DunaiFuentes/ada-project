Just reacting to this comment. Having 24/7 ready planes means having more pilots and ground technicians, and it has been made clear that forming new crews for 5 or 6 years isn't worth it if it means they have to be disbanded in 10 or 12 years. The lacking 24/7 capability issue has been known for many years now (2010 at least), and it is not an accident that it is currently planned for 2020. Deliveries of the new aircraft is planned from 2018 to 2022.

**Arbeitsverbot Pädophilie**

- Scare-mongering, emotionally loaded, unnecessairy but most of all unprecise and going way over the top. The 19 year old student who has sex with a 15 year old (who maybe lied about his age?) is clearly not a pedophile and should not be barred from teaching the rest of her life (though she certainly should receive some sentence), but she would be if this gets accepted. For this reason alone I will vote NO.
- The whole problem is already being adressed by a Gegenvorschlag auf Gesetzesebene, which is much more workable, precise and thought out.
- Additionally, implementing this kind of automatic sentencing goes against a core principle in the Swiss justice system: That every case is to be reviewed individually and sentencing is, ultimately and after careful consideration, up to the judges, who have considerable leeway in many parts of their decision.
- Related only marginally, but this whole bashing of people with a mental disorder (the pedophiles) is disgusting and will not solve the problems these people cause, on the contrary, many who have these disorder will hide even more instead of seeking the help many of them need. Especially when the word is used incorrectly and the whole Initiatve is not actually about pedophiles but about child molesters instead, but thats a whole other discussion.


**Mindestlohn**

I have actually studied economics and am quite certain that any kind of minimum wage almost always creates more poblems than it solves. Especially the kind that wants to implement one single value for the whole country and over all the different professions. Though I agree people should not have to work 50hours/week and still not earn enough to lead a normal life. That is why I chose to think some steps further and support the Bedingungsloses Grundeinkommen/Unconditional Basic Income. But the Mindestlohn is just not the right way to go, so NO to the Mindestlohn.

&gt; Down there on the lower right side is everything an educated, humanist, scientifically minded, internationally oriented, globally thinking, forward looking, progressive human being should fight against. On a personal as well as a political level.

I really disagree with that. To hold conservative positions on certain issues is, in my humble opinion, not an inherently bad thing (I understand conservatism as ""not changing what does not need changing"", easily put). Also, this chart really doesn't say much as it just represents the deviation from the national average. In some fictuous society, I'd be a left wing revolutionary, in others, I'd be some right wing nut job. Seeing that a party is on the lower right side of such a chart really doesn't ring any alarm bells with me.

&gt; You could just open a damn history book.

Again, this chart just shows the deviation from the current national average. History has absolutely nothing to do with it.

&gt; I was nowhere claiming a sole rule by the SP was a great option [...] As I said, quite simple.

Let's just say that I do agree with you that it should be a party from the top that gets to become the glorious supreme leader. ;)

Anyhow, all in all I don't really see why this chart should alarm me. I usually find myself pretty much in line with one of the parties from the top right, but there certainly have been occasions where I've voted for a more conservative stance.

**Pedobear:** I'm generally against absolutes and catch-alls in the judical system, they usually fail the ""Does it help prevent such crimes in the future?""-test. The fall-back quota is fairly low in these crimes after a conviction and they rarely happen at the offender's workplace; in about half of the cases they are family and in most other cases the victims were ""groomed"" by acquantances (both evidences are annecdotal from lawyers, I'm sorry). This initiative will have little to no impact on the actual crimerate but it will severly impact the lifes of many people to a much greater extent than would be warranted (violating the principle of commensurability - as unpopular as this statement is, it is one of the foundations of our legal system). **No**

**Mindestlohn:** I have studied economics and know that the implications of a state regulation in this affair are greater than just ""Some people earn more, and some companies go bankrupt but will be replaced!"". Such an intrusion into the market will always have consequences (rising prices mostly, which in turn can lead to fewer consumption of some services which will in turn lead to fewer employment), it depends on where the bar is set to determine how big the costs will be. At 4'000.- the bar is set too high. I am in favour of a minimal income, just not there (personally I would prefer it around 3'600.-). To further accentuate the problems, this initiative will have about zero impact in the city of Zurich (due to the already high cost of living there, making it close to impossible to get by on less) but will lead to a lot of problems in the Ticino where the overall cost is several hunderd francs lower. **No**

true,[deleted],null,null,"What many people disregard is the fact that buying the Gripen is actually going to reduce the size of our air force from 86 planes to 54 by replacing 54 Tigers by 22 Gripens. Also to keep that kind of airplane ready for war 24/7 you need more than just the 32 F/A-18 we currently have due to reliability of military aircraft being lower than that of civilian aircraft. 

To illustrate that I'd like to put a scenario out there, and that is total war. Not realistic within near future, but still, you never know what happens, as seen in Crimea. 

Say, a fighter enters Switzerland over Geneva with the mission goal being a bomb drop on the army barracks in Thun, the evac out to Brig. In that case, let's say the bomber, presumably a supersonic stealth bomber of the likes of an F-22 Raptor or an Eurofighter Typhoon would spend maybe eight minutes inside Swiss airspace, maybe six minutes from RADAR detection to bombs away. To scramble a fighter patrol you'd need at least eight to twelve minutes, as seen in German Luftwaffe exercises which simulate a squadron on ground alert being called to defend the airspace. Once you are airborne, you still have to catch up to the intruder, so probably even a subsonic B-52H or a propellor driven Tu-95B would have caused damage before you even reached it.

Conclusion from that, in a war scenario you need an airborne alert due to the small size of Switzerland. For an airborne alert you'd need, say, four patrols to cover all of Switzerland. A patrol will consist of at least two planes in formation, giving you at least eight aircraft airborne at all times. An aircraft like the F/A-18 can remain airborne for about one and a half hours without refuelling, meaning you need at least four more patrols on the ground, going up to a total of sixteen planes at least. Then you need to remember, that after every flight, a plane needs to be refuelled, oil needs to be checked, if it was in combat it needs to be checked for damages, so on and so forth. With an Air Force of 1600 men, you get about 50 men per airplane, and that is including all of the parareconmen, airfield security, and more importantly, helicopter airmen., so you are more likely looking at 20 men per airplane. Regarding these numbers I highly doubt that a turnaround can be managed within an hour, so we'd need at least two more patrols, taking the total up to twenty.

Now we get into the fun part, aircraft reliability. In a combat situation, one can get little more than 70% reliability out of an aircraft, meaning we'd need nine more planes, now we are at 29. This leaves us with a reserve of just three airplanes. We've managed to down just as many F/A-18 since 1996 in peace time, so yeah, not good.

Now for your ""top-notch"" air defence. You apparently have little idea of what we're operating on. Our newest piece of air defence is the crew-served Rapier SAM system, introduced in 1981. Next up on the list is the FIM-92 Stinger man-portable air defence system, introduced in 1971. And then, the biggest part of our air defense: The Oerlikon 35mm Fliegerabwehrkanone, introduced in 1963, used in conjunction with the Feuerleitsystem Skyguard/Super Fledermaus, introduced around the same age. We're still using technology from deep within the cold war, yet our potential enemies are from the twenty first century.

That's my two cents on our air force, and as has been proven in the past, security from foreign threats is the key to economic prosperty.

Also, I vote yea for Hausarzt, this reform is direly needed to keep our healthcare on par, nay for Pedobear, this is way over the top, the necessary steps have already been taken by the federal counsil in regard to that problem, nay for Mindestlohn, over the top again, 22CHF is just too much, it'd tear up our economy pretty badly IMO.

true,someotherswissguy,ne,Neuchâtel,"&gt; But modern combat (if switzerland will ever engage in that) doesn't need new planes. I guess we'll never have to attack somebody outside of switzerland and if somebody attacks us we'll use our top notch air defense - plane vs. plane combat is really an outdated concept.

The main purpose of the Air Force, in peace time, isn't to fly around just for the sake of it. The duty of the Air Force is to ensure aerial policy (they are the very equivalent of the police car you see around) and they are very active: about 300 interventions per year in the sky, so this is nearly 1 intervention per day. That's not even surprising when you consider the number of commercial flights above our heads, since Switzerland is located in central western Europe.

Aerial policy has to be ensured by someone, either by us or by someone else. Why should we prefer to do it ourselves? Because it is cheaper than renting this service to some other foreign forces, and also because you avoid the neutrality/independence issue. 

&gt; Make pilots and crew 24/7 ready would after 5-6 years still be cheaper than just one gripen i think.

It's true, but that's not the point. Why would this be useful for if the 24/7 capability becomes useless after just 5 or 7 years? Better not investing anything and not have 24/7 ready planes either. Either we want this 24/7 capability and make it happen (ie, replace the 54 Tigers with 22 Gripens) or we don't.

1. Setting up a 24/7 ready plane alert. This is a well known recognized lack of capability and it is planned for 2020. This is obviously possible only with the new aircraft in addition to the F/A-18, see the other comments in the thread.
2. Money invested in the economy and job creation. This might not be a direct effect, but I'd certainly prefer to spend money on the airplane and have something back, rather than spending it on other military equipment and have nothing back at all.
3. Allowing the current aerial policy duty on a longer term, beyond 2025. The F/A-18 Hornet has a life expectancy of about 30 years and is currently at mid-life, so it is expected to fly until 2030 *if the Tiger is replaced*. Without a new aircraft, the F/A-18 fleet would need to fly more often, shortening its life expectancy by a few years, and would need to be retired likely in 2025 already. Thing is, the procedure to replace an aircraft takes *a lot* of time, around 10 years, and without the Gripen we'd need to start the procedure to replace the F/A-18 next year if we want to ensure only a basic aerial policy beyond 2025 (assuming a complete new aircraft evaluation here). The Gripen is expected to fly until 2050.

Purchasing power is what you can buy with a certain amount of money and inflation measures how much less you can buy (inflation implies that purchasing power is decreasing). To make an example: Inflation is telling you how much less you can buy with CHF 100 compared to a year ago. It doesn't tell you anything about many CHF 100 you have available. That's related to income, taxes and so on, not inflation.

However, you're only affected by inflation if you actually buy the goods. E.g. when I'm telling you that prices of cars will double while everything else remains the same but you're not planing on buying a car, then your ""personal inflation"" will be zero. The CPI is one inflation measure that tries to capture what typical people buy but obviously it's never exactly what you buy.

Most economists agree that at least in the long run everything adjusts for inflation. E.g. if you know that all prices doubled then you will ask for a higher salary to compensate for that. In relative terms, nothing changes. E.g. if all prices double and all salaries double then you can buy the same amount of goods. However, for an individual person, the salary might be fixed in the short run unless they change jobs and therefore they experience inflation as something that makes them poorer.

true,Motzlord,tg,Thurgau,"&gt;  I can make 4'000 right after school

I am not sure yet what I'll vote but the thing is you can already make (almost) 4000 CHF in a lot of low level jobs. For example, working as a cashier, all the big chains pay around 25 CHF/h (the initiative proposes 22, I think). So for a lot of people and companies the change would be minimal.

I do however agree that it's problematic to implement one legal boundary for the whole country when cost of living is not the same everywhere.

I don't know how much you actually know about our air defense. But I'm a Rapier Sdt myself and I can tell you that our air defense (especially Rapier) is absolutely laughable.
