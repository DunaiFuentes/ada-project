In an ideal world you would be right. But the Zurich &lt;-&gt; Paris TGV (leaves from Gare de l'Est nowadays) is always incredibly crowded, expensive, and the seats in second class are both quite cramped and often full of small screaming children. 

Added to this you get the traditional SNCF punctuality and service...

I've taken the train quite a lot and nowadays I just don't bother anymore unless there is a very cheap price. It's far more comfortable to fly and at 200-250€ return to Zurich you can easily find a cheaper flight.

It's hard to say precisely, the trees hide everything on Google Maps :P

edit : btw the funicular itself isn't there anymore. The bottom station is now a Chinese restaurant in the Vallon neighborhood (near Bossette bar :P), the top station I don't really know (people don't agree on this one), the tunnel is still there but the top end is underground now. You can still enter the tunnel though, it's humid, full of mushrooms and weird graffitis. The end is a stone wall. Or maybe just metal rods preventing the dirt from falling, I can't remember.

The tunnel is something like 20m long but inside it's pitch dark so it looks way longer (and scarier)

Near the tunnel there is an arch that used to be part of a bridge used by the funicular. There's only a piece of the arch in the woods, it's very beautiful.

The top entrance is under the ground as I said, but if you go where it's located I think you can see the keystone with the building year engraved on it. A guy said he found it but refused to say where it was.

Now way lower than all this, near the Vallon, there are remains of rails coming out of the ground. It's pretty dangerous, falling on them is a bad idea (they're all rusty and shit). They might have disappeared completely under the ground now.

Near the entrance of the tunnel there is a cave, not a big cave but a decent sized ""room"" in the molasse facade. There used to be matresses inside and trash so I think bums might be sleeping there sometimes. It's a shame that they would leave shit behind them because going there with friends is funny. We should make a reddit meetup in the cave haha

Btw, I'm proud to be the reason of your first comment after 4 months of lurking ;)

edit 2 : if you're interested in that kind of shit, there is also a room, but a real room this time, carved in the stone near Harper's pub, along the path that goes from Rue de la Barre to Collège des Oiseaux. It's a really shitty ugly place with syringes and condoms on the ground so I wouldn't go there at night. The room has a small window and a door, both are shut and impossible to open. I don't know who owns the room now. Its story is interesting though, because the whole place used to be a huge... ""campagne"" (don't know the English word), a domain with a huge house and funny stuff around where rich people would go and write letters to Lord Byron or masturbate or other hobbies. The room in the stone facade was one of these places.
