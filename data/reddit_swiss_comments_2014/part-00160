&gt;

&gt;__Lake Lucerne__ ([German](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_language): *Vierwaldstättersee*, lit. ""Lake of the Four [Forested Cantons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waldst%C3%A4tte)"") is a [lake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake) in central [Switzerland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switzerland) and the fourth largest in the country.

&gt;The lake has a complicated shape, with bends and arms reaching from the city of [Lucerne](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucerne) into the mountains. It has a total area of 114 km² (44 sq mi), an elevation of 434 m (1,424 ft), and a maximum depth of 214 m (702 ft). Its volume is 11.8 km³. Much of the shoreline rises steeply into mountains up to 1,500 m above the lake, resulting in many picturesque views including those of [Mount Rigi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Rigi) and [Mount Pilatus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Pilatus).

&gt;The [Reuss River](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuss_River) enters the lake at [Flüelen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fl%C3%BCelen) (in the canton of Uri, the part called *Urnersee*) and exits at Lucerne. The lake also receives the [Muota](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muota) (at Brunnen) [Engelberger Aa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engelberger_Aa) (at Buochs), the [Sarner Aa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarner_Aa) (at [Alpnachstad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpnachstad)).

There are two things you will have to go to either way. There is a general information evening where you'll get invited to and there is the recruitment which takes two to three days (only one or two in your case).

It helps if you go to the recruitment prepared. If you think your allergies and asthma (and other medical problems) will get you deemed unfit, bring your health certificate from your doctor and make sure you know when and whom to show. They might still make you do a couple of tests, but it's much easier to get out if you're prepared and have documents with you that already say that you're probably unfit.",0,1402074676,null,0,false,0,ci0ti1l,t3_27gv0n,t1_ci0ti1l,t1_ci0szkl,null,1434122345,2,false,Switzerland,t5_2qhp6,2
