false,Neirdark,null,null,"The sole purpose of that video is to create segregation and hatred between the Muslim communities in Switzerland and the rest of the country. The organisation behind this video IZRS is ""allegedly"" funded via ""Gulf states"" benefactors (Saudi clerics). These types of organisations are created specifically for the sole purpose of promoting segregation and fanning ethnic and religious tension. They are also part of the vast proxy war between Saudi Arabia and Qatar, a war whose results can be seen both in Muslim lands and in Western countries.

The video is not intended for consumption by Swiss Muslims but it is intended for consumption by the general Swiss population in order to illicit a backlash against the Muslim population in Switzerland. The video is specifically designed to provoke and illicit a counter response from non Muslims towards people they identify as being Muslim.

By doing this the Wahhabi organisation IZRS creates a hostile atmosphere from the Swiss population towards the Muslim community thus creating the perfect ground's for their brand of militant Islamism and new conversions.
IZRS wants the minarets to be banned forever. They want hijabs to be forbidden and are using niqab, burqa in order to shock the population. They want to see neo-nazis attacking mosques. They want the Muslim community in Switzerland to feel hated, threatened and outcasted. They win by making it impossible for normal Muslims to live a normal life in Switzerland.

They want Mosques to be burnt, as it happened recently in Flums (SG), where an Albanian mosque was attacked with Molotov cocktails, which could even be a false flag attack.

These organisation are present all over the EU and they are all funded by the same people from the same region. You probably remember the shariah police in Germany or the recent actions in London. Their goal is the same everywhere: Stop integration, increase segregation, create conditions beneficial for the spread of Wahhabism and, decrease the possibility of ""non orthodox"" interpretations of Islam.

These organisations are dangerous and they pose a direct threat towards the Muslim population living in the EU, such organisations should not be tolerated or accepted, religion should be.

I also admit that the referendum against minarets was politically motivated and launched in order to gain publicity, sadly it passed. There were already enough regulations and methods at Gemeinde/Commune level to forbid or to accept the construction of such buildings. This paranoid referendum wasn't needed at all.

I hope we could try to do something in order to control the nutjobs from both sides (IZRS and SVP). I also hope that Muslims could understand the aims and methods of such wahabi groups that don't/won't ever try to act in favor of other Islamic currents or to fight religious discrimination. They must be unanimously condemned and controlled, but not banned.

We should also clearly remember that most Jihadists are converts and are rarely born into Islam. Political and hate proselytism hidden into religion must be carefully monitored by Swiss authorities. Sadly, I don't trust them to do so and I know they aren't knowledgable enough on the subject.

Maybe you should make sure that you ping a machine inside their network. For example `upc-cablecom.ch`. If a technician says that the machine might be overloaded then he can probably check the machine himself. 

A *fun* server to ping would probably be `hsi.upc-cablecom.ch` since it contains their [speedtest website](http://hsi.upc-cablecom.ch/speedtest/).

Pinging google and cdn servers is generally a bad idea since these ips are [multihomed](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multihoming) and depending on the location the traceroute might look different. Google also does some fancy stuff with icmp. Looking at your traceroute it seems that its either your router, the link between your router and cablecom endpoint, or the cablecom endpoint.

You can generate addresses, which act like bank account numbers. In the ""Send Bitcoin"" dialog, you can input the address/account nubmer of someone else, the amount you wish to send and an optional transaction fee of your choosing to speed things along. Once you hit send, your transaction is broadcast to the network (which consists of all the people using the same software) and after some 1-2 hours, the transaction is confirmed, the bitcoins are in the recipients wallet/program and not in yours anymore. [Here's a screenshot of the send screen](http://i.imgur.com/h892JHQ.png)

You can run a different program that does mathematically difficult calculations with the broadcasted transactions, basically trying to solve a math puzzle. If you solve it successfully, you publish your result to the network and, if you're the first to solve it correctly, you're awarded some bitcoins ""out of thin air"", along with the (optional) transaction fees of the transactions you included as a reward. Successfully completing the math puzzle and broadcasting is (and it getting accepted by the network) is what ""seals"" the included transactions as done, so this thing is what actually makes the network run. People who do this are called miners and they're the people that make the whole infrastructure run. And the network is made in such a way that a only one puzzle can be solved every 10 minutes and it needs several solved puzzles (around 5) for your transaction to be verified. That's why it takes 1-2 hours for a transaction to go through.

Since there's a ton of different people doing the mining, and since the puzzles are validated by consensus, as long as no one controls more than 50% of the whole network, the network is safe, and you'd need a LOT of computing power to match 50% of the computing power of the whole network. So there's no central authority (like a bank) that controls the whole thing. No one controls it, it just works base on all the people involved in it.

There's a lot of math involved to make sure no one can fake the math puzzle solution, that only one solution is correct at any given time and that no one can spend the same coins more than once. And there's no way to undo a transaction once you hit send.
