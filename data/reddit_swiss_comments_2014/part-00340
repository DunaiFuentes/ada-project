What draws me back to Switzerland (besides the usual cultural things that one misses about his home country) is the combination of a relatively liberal stance (you're pretty much free to do what you please as long as you don't cause anyone else any serious trouble) with a sane legal system, probably the world's most stable political system and efficient public administration. Once you've built up a livelihood in Switzerland, you can be pretty sure it will work out until you grow old (climate change issues aside, that we can't flee anyway).

Or to boil it down to one catchphrase: In Switzerland the government is the citizen's employee (as it should be in a real *demo*cracy), and *not the other way round*.

Let's compare it to a few other places: 

* USA: More opportunities (to become wealthy), much higher risk of ending up in prison or on the streets, much less civil rights, much higher legal risks for businesses. As a Swiss I'd be scared as hell to live there. 

* Germany/France: Similar to Switzerland but less liberal, less civil rights and usually less money left on the table.

* Japan: More comfortable to live in once you're integrated (everything is prepared and made for you, the service level is bar none), *feels* very safe, but the legal system is scary for Westerners and it's much more difficult to open up small businesses that doesn't follow the usual patterns (restaurants and other low productivity shops).

Transport system is a good point that I forgot to talk about - it's an important factor that determines a lot of your life quality. When I visit the West Coast for example, I'm feeling very much restrained in my mobility, since public transport is such a hassle and car rides take forever and you can't plan ahead. It's crazy how the Zurich region has at least 10x the public transport possibilities of the Bay area, which is much more populated. 

Edit: Oh and if you want to see a public transport system that's even *way* better than the Swiss one, visit Japan. Switzerland is second place with quite a big distance compared to that.

I also didn't say the US is less liberal - I'd say it's *more* liberal than Switzerland. If you compare the amount of regulations an employer or landlord has to follow, it's

USA &lt; Switzerland &lt; Germany/France

So Switzerland is somewhere in between. You can most of the time fire employees, but you'll usually have to give them 3 months notice, and you can't do it if they are in military service or pregnant. You can make tenants leave, but again there's 3 months notice, raising rent is somewhat restricted etc. This shows pretty well a different balance we have in Switzerland when it comes to personal freedoms: You should have as much as possible *as long as you don't cause anyone else serious hurt*, which includes your employees and tenants. Here's where the stable political system comes in: In a direct democracy, if you want to change these laws, say to become more friendly to landlords, you'll have a very hard time convincing the majority. Lobbies become *much* less powerful this way. Yet still, people don't vote for laws as socialistic as in Germany and France, since at the same time unions aren't as powerful as they are there - probably again an effect of direct democracy.

I got to know my neighbors, people smile back to you on the street, almost  everyone is willing to communicate in English and I have not yet felt any sort of discrimination but I do know that it exists.

* The food - As far as I know, traditional Swiss food limits itself to rosti, fondue, raclette, Zurchergeschnetzeltes and some sort of pasta that the Swiss don't like when you call it pasta. Similar to the US, you will find all sorts of cuisines available in CH so you have a lot to chose from.

* Geographical location - Switzerland is located in the heart of Europe and you're in driving distance of the French or Italian coast. You can fly from Zurich to almost anywhere in Europe and you can also fly to the US (direct flight) so if you like to travel and visit other places, Switzerland is a very good place to live in.

* The Alps - Arguably, Switzerland has the most beautiful Alps. If you're a sucker for driving on mountain roads (like I am) then you'll absolutely love it here. If you search for ""Top 10 roads to drive on in the world"", Switzerland has at least two spots reserved on that list. If you like winter sports then that's another [big plus](http://flagpedia.net/data/flags/big/ch.png), you can do it almost anywhere in Switzerland. Hiking or Cycling through the Alps is another great thing to do.

* Beauty - Ranging from the Swiss French Women to the beautiful scenery, you have it all. I have not yet seen a country that was more beautiful and made its beauty so easily accessible.

* German rigorousity done with flair - It's quite hard to explain this one but I'll give it a shot. Swiss people tend to put more soul in the things they do compared to Germans. Things will always be properly done but it will feel like people are doing them and not machines.

* High quality of life - [Mercer Quality of Living Survey](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercer_Quality_of_Living_Survey) places Zurich on #2, Geneva #8 and Bern #10. 

* Money - You will have similar salaries in some of the Nordic countries but the weather will suck and you'll get 3 hours of sun during the winter. If you work in Switzerland and travel abroad, you will find most places to be very cheap. It's an absolute nightmare to buy/build a house in Switzerland but with that money you could easily afford one house in the south of France and another in the mountains somewhere in Europe.

* Infrastructure - The Swiss transportation system is one of the best in the world. I would say that almost everything in Zurich is 30 minutes away. If you can't take a bus, then take a train and you'll still be there on time. Switzerland also has one of the highest motorway densities in the world. Swiss cities are very bicycle friendly, this might not be much for someone that lives in Western Europe but coming from Eastern Europe I can tell you that this is another strong point.

* Schooling - Heavily subsidized by the state, schools are free or almost free in Switzerland. ETH Zurich is the best University in Continental Europe and one of the best in the World. ETH costs 1500 CHF/year, a student with a part-time job can easily cover this expense. If your kids go to school here they will be able to speak German, English, French and maybe even Italian by the time they finish school. Schools in Switzerland somewhat follow the German model of apprenticeship vs specialization which means that as a student you can start making good money while also studying. That's another [big plus](http://flagpedia.net/data/flags/big/ch.png)

I was more referring to the mountains of bureaucratic paperwork that one must wade through to get anywhere.

From getting our marriage recognized (it was recognized in two other countries already, but Switzerland just had to make it extra difficult), to getting my name changed, to whether or not I could have an insurance policy, to whether or not my education would be recognized, etc, etc, etc.  The experience has been terrible.  

The worst part was that my husband and I spent at least six months in contact with the separate offices and people in charge *before* ever getting married to make sure we did everything correctly.  We did it all the way we were told to do it, but then--lo and behold--it turned out that nobody in the bureaucratic administrations communicated with each other or knew what decisions the other one was making.

But you don't seem to understand my point: this is the internet, all the information (well let's say 90% of it) you want to know is already out there. It's **your** job to search that information, don't expect others to just feed it to you (especially not when when it's asked over and over again) - this holds true for many things in life.

&gt; And the part about people asking once a week is something that I couldn't possibly know. 

Yes you could - by browsing through the sub. Again: this is something I'd expect from someone seeking information.

I guess people are downvoting you because your submission &amp; comments read like you just threw a dart at a globe and it landed on Switzerland, and now you expect us to fill you in. As I said: you don't seem (because you don't mention any point about it) to know why you want to move here.
