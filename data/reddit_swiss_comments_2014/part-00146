true,CalibratedChaos,ag,Aargau,"Neutrality isn't necessarily a love of anything. As an American living in Switzerland, I often explain that Swiss neutrality is less of a hippie ""let's all be cool"" and more of a big middle finger ""screw ALL of you!"" More importantly, ""peace loving"" does not equal ""neutral."" It merely means you don't participate in any wars, not that you think they are evil and not to be supported in any possible way. 

At a very pragmatic level, both employ a concept of ""armed neutrality"" where their status as independent states isn't guaranteed by the rest of the world respecting their status, but by having enough of an army to make invasion unappealing. And, at a very practical level, it is useful to keep their costs under control by selling their weapons for export to increase volume. So, there is that practical side. 

The other practical side is that they do not participate in alliances, which European history in particular has shown tends to be the fastest way into a war. But that also means they don't choose sides on ANY aspect, leading to thing like the Nazi gold scandal in Switzerland. It also means that countries whose status is ""complicated"" can only really buy weapons from countries like these. More importantly, they can only COUNT on buying weapons and their spare parts for the long term from countries like these. Look at the recent decision in Brazil to buy Saab Gripen fighters rather than F-18's. (Ironically, the Swiss government recently decided to buy the same fighter, only to have it voted down by the people) keeping in mind the often-complicated relationship between Latin America and the US, is it wise for Brazil to buy a fighter they expect to keep for 30-50 years from a country that's liable to apply economic sanctions if they don't like how you handle internal matters? Or from a country that might starts refusing to ship you weapons if they don't like how you use those weapons? Or is it better to buy from a country with a 200-year history of never getting involved in such matters?

That said, I also know that Switzerland expressly forbids the export of components for weapons of mass destruction and weapons to countries with significant human rights abuses (a very short list of about 10 countries included Pakistan and North Korea). So there are some limits, but the Swiss generally make small arms and ammunition only, whereas Sweden makes vehicles as well.
