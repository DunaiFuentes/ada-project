lol, jokes aside. Medical marijuana is available in Switzerland, but you probably won't find a doctor who prescribes it to you as there are many regulations, making it not very profitable for all involed parties. Plus, health care companies don't cover it (medical marijuana is a lot more expensive than street stuff because of said regulations), so the costs will give you more headaches than you can treat with the stuff.

Serious answer: Go visit a doctor. They are a variety of drugs for migraine and if one doesn't work or affect you negatively, the doctor will be glad to try others with you. Also, pills are not the only way of treating migraine (it should be also noted that migraine is often just a symptome for an underlying problem, from stress to nearly everything).

If you really want marijuana, just go outside and ask the next person that looks like he might have something. Or go to a cannabis shop (they don't sell if officially, but often behind the counter. At least that's what I heard.) Although it's illegal, it's very common and there isn't such a thing as a 'war on drugs' in Switzerland. There are even people walking in the crowded streets in the middle of the day smoking weed. If you get caught, there's mostly just a small fee to pay (and not even that, most of the time there's just a warning and they confiscate the stuff).
