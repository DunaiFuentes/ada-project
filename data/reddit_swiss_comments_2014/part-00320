To answer your question, I kind of do think that letting people immigrate is just an easy solution to problems we don't want to deal with. You're talking about the fact that we need them for the growth of our economy, standard of living and retirement insurance. I see those things as problems we have to face. Because the more people that immigrate, the more people we have to immigrate to support their retirement when they are old. It's almost like exponential growth which I see as a bubble that is going to burst at one point. Also, we seem to need foreigners to do shitty jobs we don't want to do. Again, it's easy to just let them do those, but is it okay? How about we fucking clean our shit up ourselves?

Economy isn't everything to me. Fuck our standard of living, we don't deserve it. All people need is a house to live in and food on the table.

Sorry to dig this up, but that's just not true. While it's true that non-europeans need to get sponsored by a company, EU and Swiss citizens are (at least at the moment) at the same level, legally speaking. If you are a EU citizen, you can basically just come and apply for a 6 month ""looking for work""-visa, which under normal circumstamces you will get. That Swiss citizens may be chosen over foreigners can have a variety of reasons, not exclusing prejudice and xenophobia. However, I would think that in international sectors such as finance this would be irrelevant.

No. You'd have better luck with your Computer Science degree. You could look into doing your Master's here although life is expensive so you'd definitely have to find a job. I suggest you decide where to go and start learning the local language. Low level jobs pay well enough for students (20-25 CHF/h), so if you can speak the language at a basic level, you will increase your chances of finding a job. If you were thinking of waitering or cashiering, you need to speak it pretty well though.

Also, have you ever been here? If you haven't, do that first.


About the service age: Not sure, sorry. However, you would actually earn money while serving, rhe minimum adds up to about 2000 CHF/month. With your degree, you could probably get more.
