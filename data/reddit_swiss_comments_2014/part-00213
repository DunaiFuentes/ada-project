The first hut in Salanfe is pretty big and busy, the second one the Cab. de Susanfe CAS is tiny and very cozy (i loved it there).

2. another 10km ~1300m up and 1100m down, roughly 9-10 hours
3. 8.5km and basically only downhill for ~1200m alt difference

the first and last day are basically hikes with great view, not demanding unless distance is a problem, second day is tough especially the ascend to Haute Cime and the day is not over when you get back down, you still have to go for 2km downhill, not steep though.

Good slopes can be available at the mid of november or mid of february, depending on how good or bad the winter is. last winter was almost inexistent so you got fair chances that the next one will be just fine as fortunately two bad winters in a row are very rare.
If you ride parks, you will anyway be good: Saas Fee (with pipe), Zermatt (just rails and kicker lines) and others have their glaciers open around almost the whole year.

&gt;

&gt;__Cenovis__ is a product based on [yeast extract](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yeast_extract) similar to [Marmite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marmite) and [Vegemite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vegemite), rich in [vitamin B1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thiamine). In the form of a dark brown food paste, it is used to flavour soups, sausages and salads. The most popular way to consume Cenovis, however, is to spread it on a slice of buttered bread, as stated on the product's packaging.

&gt;Cenovis is popular in [Switzerland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switzerland), (particularly [Romandy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romandy)). It was developed in [Rheinfelden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rheinfelden) in 1931, on the initiative of a master brewer called Alex Villinger,  and was subsequently produced by the company *Cenovis SA*.

&gt;In 1999, a trio of entrepreneurs from [Geneva](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geneva), Michel Yagchi, Didier Fischer and Frank Guemara purchased the brand and relaunched it applying modern marketing methods.

This is how Swiss celebrate it: In the morning they go to a Buurezmorge (breakfast on a farm), during the days they spend the time with their family and in the evening they either visit one of the big fireworks in the cities or stay at home to BBQ with friends and light their own small firework.
