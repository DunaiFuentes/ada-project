I'm not against that someone who watches TV pays, but you cannot force someone who doesn't to pay for it.

The argument that everybody with internet connection  have to pay because they put their programs on the internet is ridiculous, I didn't asked them to put their programs on the internet and even in this form I don't watch them.

False. They say on their website: anybody who have ADSL and media player have to pay. And if the new law pass simply everybody will have to pay. Extortion racket.

I hate TV format. I hate sitting and watching some guy slowly reading some text somebody wrote for him, mixed with ads. This is too much waste of time. In the same time I can read same news 10 times, from various sources and points of view.

Likewise, I nave no interest in watching foot or tennis. 

I would agree to pay some little tax (10x smaller), if not the extreme arrogance of billag and TV lobby. In this situation I prefer to vote for nobillag initiative even it means the end of public TV.

Yes, concerting the Billag fees into a tax would be good to simply things. Beyond this I'm not unhappy enough with the status quo to want a revolution.

One important aspect is also the cross-region financing. For example the Italian branch gets 22% of the budget to serve 4% of the population. If you privatize as you propose, you'll get an official news-channel with few listeners and the rest is covered commercially from Italy with a few tiny local stations thrown in. Swiss journalism in the region will be mostly dead.

The Swiss-German region will suffer least because it is the biggest and also it is culturally quite separate from Germany. The cultural and language differences with the big neighbors are much smaller in the French and Italian speaking parts of the county.
