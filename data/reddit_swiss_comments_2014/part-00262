Didn't electronic voting got cancelled in a some cantons after testing it? Again, a lot of parties don't want that because they are focused on old voters. It's the same as in the USA where Republicans try to exclude people from voting. E.g. in a lot of communities you still have to be present to vote and the vote takes place during a time that younger people would never choose which de facto excludes them from voting (it's as if we would say that you have to vote with a mobile phone from now, which would defacto exclude old people)
