You're just trying to make racism a taboo topic. And it already is a taboo topic in Switzerland. We have now over 20 years of SVP racism and an entire generation that had to grow up with it and still hardly anyone has the balls to say it. The Swiss live in this 'there's no racism in Switzerland' bubble and it's exactly because of people like you that make it something we're not supposed to talk about. I'm well aware that the Swiss aren't openly racist but that's exactly the point. People think it's okay to be racists just because it isn't to obvious. It's this grey zone where they SVP is operating that is the actually problem. Where you know that the statements are targeting foreigners but it's always said in a way so that it is technical/legally not racist. Your statements are the perfect example.

Like I told you before. I am not trying to make it a taboo topic. It is a very important issue that needs to be discussed and it shouldn't be accepted by anyone. But it's fucking annoying if you are discussing something related to ethnic groups and some retard comes up calling me a racist.

Just fucking learn to differentiate. Please read this before doing any more writing: http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rassismus
As it says, raceism is mainly when you think one race is superior to another or discrimination.  In my first post, I declared that I view ""foreigners"" as equals:
&gt;I wouldn't say that people from the balkan are physically superior to us (neither are we to them).

In this thread I never said anything racist (no prejudice, no discrimination and no talking about superiority). I can't say that about you. I actually think you are pretty racist. To back up that claim, the following quotes are from you:

* Are you talking about some 10-generation-pure-Swiss-incest-SVP voters or so?
* The Swiss live in this 'there's no racism in Switzerland' bubble
* I'm well aware that the Swiss aren't openly racist

Guess what? Saying that swiss are racist, is racist. 
And you are not just a racist, you are also a very hateful person, worse than any racist I ever met.

Isn't that ironic?

The SVP is racist. Some of their voters too. But you can't say that swiss people are racist because that is absolutely untrue. I haven't met many racists so far and the ones I met weren't quiet about it.

&gt;and it's exactly because of people like you that make it something we're not supposed to talk about.

&gt;but I guess we're not supposed to talk about that either...

First of all, I didn't say you aren't supposed to talk about racism/racist acts. I just said you shouldn't overdo it because you are clearly not able to differentiate.

You don't want me to talk about ethnic groups and now you're crying around because you think I told you to shut up. Don't shut up, please. But focus it on those who deserve it and are actually racists.
