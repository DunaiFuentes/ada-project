(TOO DRUNK PLEASE IGNORE LEST BE OFFENDED) The only reason Geneva is of any importance is because it's part of Switzerland. You can kiss all these international organizations goodbye if you secede.


But seriously, 80k net immigrants every year is an issue. That's a new city every single year (in 2007, the Federal Council expected 8000 every year, lol). I'm not for the SVP initiative but I expect some proposals by the opponents.

edit:

Doesn't the US have immigration quotas? http://www.immigralaw.com/english/immigrationquotas.html
