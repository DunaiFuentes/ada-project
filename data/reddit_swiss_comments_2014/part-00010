Wallis: Güet

&gt;Swiss citizenship is propagated by Jus sanguinis. Persons as follows are Swiss citizens at birth:

&gt;born to a Swiss father or mother, if parents are married

&gt;born to a Swiss mother, if parents are not married

&gt;born to a Swiss father, if parents are not married, and the father subsequently acknowledges the child as his own

&gt;Where parents marry after birth and only the father is Swiss, the child acquires Swiss citizenship at that point. A recent change in the Swiss citizenship Act allows the child of an unmarried Swiss father to be acknowledged by paternity from the Swiss father with the child, in which the child after such acknowledgement is then a Swiss citizen, by descent, Jus sanguinis.

&gt;There are exceptions if it is only the mother who is Swiss and she acquired Swiss citizenship on the basis of a previous marriage (practice discontinued in 1992) to a Swiss citizen.

&gt;Jus soli does not exist in Switzerland so birth in Switzerland in itself does not confer Swiss citizenship on the child.
