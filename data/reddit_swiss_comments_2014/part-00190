1. Get a job: I was working for an international company and got reassigned. My wife happened to be a dual citizen (but Suisse Romande, and we live in the German region) which massively greased the skids to get me here.  However, since being here, I transferred another employee from the States here and it was a cast iron bitch. We still managed it, but it took a lot of special circumstances to get him here. The law is that we have to prove we couldn't possibly find a Swiss to do the job. We work with some very unique material, which helped, but even then I had the government telling me how much I had to pay him, only issuing an L permit, etc etc. basically they tried to make it such that I would never want to try importing an American again. (They succeeded)

2. Here is the advice I give every other American thinking of leaving: don't. If you are looking to leave your home for anything less than a shooting war, don't. Be immigrating towards something, not emigrating away from something. The level of ""hate"" you describe is such a tiny tickle in the world of bad things. There are plenty of things that bad everywhere. 

3. Actually come to Switzerland for as long as you can first. As in, not a vacation. A lot of places are nice on holiday. Actually try living here. Discover how expensive things are, how short the shop hours are, how NOTHING happens on Sunday. Get a few passive aggressive notes. Get screamed at in traffic. Experience the social isolation. Live without a decent hamburger available. Try to speak Swiss German. The whole point is to de-romanticize it a much as possible, get to the real thing and then see how you feel. 

The image of Switzerland in the US is a long, long way from reality. That said, Switzerland IS a very nice place to live, and a beautiful place. But you have to know what you are getting into, and not everything will suit. Maybe those things won't matter to you, if so, great. But they might, and it is better you know what you are jumping into before you move. 

I say this as an American - most (not all) Americans who want to move here need a very hard slap in the face. This can be a great place to be. High pay, beautiful country, proximity to everything europe has to offer, clean, quiet, safe. But it is far, far from a land of delight.

I realize that the cost of living is extraordinarily high. That is something I will have to get used to because I grew up in a small town where most everything was decently inexpensive.
