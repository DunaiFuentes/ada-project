true,b4silio,vd,Vaud,"Several people have already replied to this, but indeed, you can truly get by without a car. To get you jumpstarted, here's a couple of tips:

* http://www.cff.ch &lt;-- this is the main website for trains, but it takes into account all public transportation. A good way to see how much time it takes to go places (google maps is also a good way to do that :D). They also have an app where you can make train/but tickets on the fly, while running to get your train (local trains have a habit of being unnervingly punctual).

* http://www.mobility.ch &lt;-- this is the main car sharing service, you can have a yearly subscription for ~300$ or have a ""Click-and-Drive"" card for free and then you can just rent a car automatically whenever you need it. Prices are very reasonable if you need it for a couple of hours or so, but if you plan to rent a car for a whole day you're better off with something like www.europcar.ch

IMPORTANT: regardless of what you end up doing, purchase a ""Demi Tarif"" card, that halves all public transports prices for ~160$ per year (less if you take several years at once). You'll cover its costs with one or two  trips to Zurich or any other city in Switzerland. There is the ""Abonnement General"" which for ~3200$ per year makes ALL public transportations FREE. It's actually expensive and you might end up paying less if you pay on a ticket basis, but it's something to know (if you plan to travel extensively for a while, you can also get it for a month or two)

Regarding language, Vevey has the headquarters of Nestlé, so you'll have thousands of people around that speak perfect english (including in stores, restaurants and doctors, dentists and all). The closest proper city is Lausanne, which has roughly 30'000 people studying or working at the 2 universities, who also speak english on a daily basis. So you won't find yourself linguistically stranded.

Yes, check the SBB homepage for the fastest route from Lucerne to Milano and look up which station is the closest to the border (probably Chiasso).
If your Swiss Flexi Pass is valid on that date, you can simply buy a ticket that is valid from Chiasso to Milano while your Flexi Pass covers Lucerne- Chiasso. 

You can buy tickets in advance, either online or at the counter.

If you buy the ticket online, you should make sure to follow the instructions and pick the ticket up at an SBB counter once you're in Switzerland.  

Buying the ticket at the counter may be easier since the SBB employee can help you, but you might have to pay a service fee. 

Just make sure to get the right ticket (Chiasso-Milano), the right date, and the right time (i.e. the time you depart from Chiasso) on the ticket. Train tickets usually expire after a short time, so you need to make sure that it is valid when you travel to Milano, and also back to Switzerland if you're buying a 2-way ticket.
