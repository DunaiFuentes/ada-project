Well, I would say the best person is going to be your supervisor for your Technical Student contract. I guess they should be able to at least introduce you to someone who has been involved in PhDs at CERN, who can suggest some universities, and more importantly, contacts within the universities.

Otherwise, try to investigate people that have been involved in the kind of PhDs that you're hoping to get. Raise the question in Any Other Business sections of meetings (e.g. Group meeting). You need to at least get a name of someone, and you can email them, or ask them in person. Or even just send out a few blind emails to section and group heads. Most staff are happy to help with stuff like this if they can.

I dare say you won't find those people frequenting this subreddit, though.

Another angle of approach is going to be emailing universities, enquiring if they are keenly involved with CERN, and if there is someone in the CS department that might talk about a possible PhD with placement at CERN.

If you did your undergrad in a Member State university, seek friendly staff contacts there.

For sure, studying a Masters in a non-Member State definitely increases the challenge of finding someone to talk to. And if you don't have a warm supervisor, even more so.

I'm glad to read this - I had a very different experience a few years ago when I last had a (comparatively minor) issue that I felt strongly about.  After having a ton of trouble even finding contact information (some of the profiles on the admin.ch pages were incomplete) I wrote what I thought were very heartfelt, polite, well-sourced mails to several National- and Ständeräte (this was in Zug) asking them to vote against a motion condemning ""Killerspiele"".  I received two replies out of seven contacted, both in effect telling me to piss off, you have no idea what you're talking about.  I mean, these were _really_ condescending and dismissive.  

I had a similar experience with another (again, small) issue - wanting increased punishment for use of laser pointers.  I'm a hobby astronomer, so these are useful tools, and we already have laws to cover misuse.  Same thing.  

I tend to only do this for ""fringe"" issues, because these are the ones that are usually only of interest to small groups - and are generally driven by someone with way too much time and passion on their hands, so they tend to not get enough debate.  But my encounter with the whole thing was pretty disappointing.  I agree with you that it's a waste of time the way it's set up and I tend to do the same as you, but that's a least-worst way of dealing with a poor situation.

Fair enough, but if you consider this

Yes, it can be solved by smart people and it will, but it's just not true that the system is planned out well for increased capacity.

Case and point: Bahnhof Hardbrücke in Zürich. They had a this [project ""Change""](https://www.stadt-zuerich.ch/hbd/de/index/entwicklungsgebiete/zuerich_west/projekte_geplant/bahnhof_hardbruecke.html) to rebuild the station, but they didn't consider that in the future the amount of passengers using the station would double.  
Blunders like this keep happening, but they get solved eventually. It's not a very smooth ride though.. and having to replan projects like this costs a lot of money.

Also the housing situation in Zürich (and AFAIK Geneva) is horrendous. Affordable apartments are just not available. There is the risk of a housing bubble and measurable [urban sprawl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urban_sprawl). This again causes increased traffic. This is mostly a political problem though.

I'm not saying these are reasons to limit immigration, but I don't agree that we're currently prepared for the amount of immigrants that come here every year.

&gt; - what of the Suisse Romande and Valais, they try and integrate, but have you seen a Genevois speak German in Zürich? I haven't. Likewise you wouldn't catch a Zürcher speaking French south-west.
&gt; - and second, are these people bad for society because they don't speak the language? Is language the only ""integrating"" factor? What if they believe in the confederation - and all its values - however can't speak the language, would we consider them unintegrated?

Well, I have seen people from Geneva speaking German here in Zürich, but I guess that's anecdotal evidence on both sides.  
There are quite some differences between the Romandie and the German part and we notice that almost every time there is vote and the Romandie votes different than the rest of Switzerland. This has also caused tension. So it's not totally a non-issue.

Language was just an example. Of course there are more important factors, but language is an important one because most of integration happens through communication. We already have several language borders in this country and we already see the effect of subcultures forming as I mentioned above.  
Since all the Swiss share most values the language difference is not as problematic, but if we consider culturally different people a different language will definitely hinder integration.

&gt; - IMHO places like Chinatown enhance most cities, they add vibrancy and life to them.

Chinatown sure. That was probably a bad example. One of the big advantages of immigration is that we can participate in their culture. I like diversity a lot even if it just comes down to the food choices when I go to a restaurant.  
However we don't always have such sub cultures that are as open towards the Swiss as Chinatowns are in the US.

The first tax bracket in the USA is $9000 USD (~8700 CHF) while in, for instance Zurich, it is 6700 CHF. You would assume more Americans are going without paying taxes. But we have a sort of Quellensteuer called a pay-roll tax that many people below $9000/year have to pay. Because of that, it ends up being 14% of all households that don't pay taxes. I'm not sure what the percentage is in Switzerland, but I doubt it is significantly different. The percentage of people that don't vote is much greater in both countries.

It's a default you can opt out of in the US, while in Switzerland, you get paid your full salary (minus AVS), and when you pay your taxes, they come out of your bank account balance, making it blatantly obvious to you that the government is taking your money to use. 

In contrast, if you're a regular employee in the US (or pretty much anywhere in the rest of Europe, for that matter), you never even notice that you pay taxes on your salary and usually get a refund from the government every year.
