I don't know if it's possible that the Bundesrat would have to stand trial if he wouldn't be able to enforce the initiative (which means: present a law that gets accepted in parliament). It would also be possible that certain members of the Bundesrat wouldn't get re-elected because of this failure (although this is not very likely).

The initiative itself is not vague at all, it is very explicit, actually. The only thing the Bundesrat has to do now is to find and present the number of how many foreigners are allowed to stay and work in Switzerland. And this will be a huge issue: The Bundesrat will try to set that number as high as possible (to minimize the problems with EU but also because of the needs of the economy) but low enough so that the supporters of the Masseneinwanderungsinitiative don't feel cheated.

One thing is for sure: Whatever that number will be, it will be much too high for the SVP. So prepare yourself for lots of discussions about how many foreigners Switzerland ""can bear"". And even more wrangling that the Bundesrat doesn't accept the will of the people.

There is also another issue: The Ecopop initiative about which we decide in 2015 or 2016. It is even stricter than the MEI: If it gets accepted then the net immigration must not outnumber 0.2% of the resident population. This means only 16'000 new immigrants per year. 

If the Bundesrat doesn't act fast enough and makes progress, there is a high risk that the Yes voters will support this much stricter initiative.

There currently is a certain amount of tension between school boards from the Eastern part of Switzerland and the rest of the country about English, BTW. Second-language school lessons begin very early now - between the age of six to eight, I believe - and while most of the cantons teach the next largest national language first (French for the Swiss Germans, German for the Swiss French) the Eastern part of the country, roughly from Zürich onwards, eschew this for English, only teaching French as a third language.

true,Tefal,vd,Vaud,"Disclaimer: Swiss French speaking.

There is very little explicit, conscious tension between the linguistic regions of Switzerland. It is going pretty well.

Unconsciously, there is a certain amount of background resentment. People do not talk too often about it, but the Swiss French have a nagging feeling they are being looked down upon by the Swiss Germans who are stereotypically over-orderly, obsessed by rules, bland, unfunny, and speak an obscure language that sounds more like a serious throat disorder than a variant of German. Only the latter is almost always true to a French speaker ;)

Nagging aside, a Federal Councillor of my canton said once that the Swiss go along well together because they do not understand each other. There is truth in that, and solid proof of this is that the media landscapes of each linguistic region are essentially disjointed. Each region sticks firmly in the cultural sphere of influence of the bigger country: the Swiss Germans with the Germans, the Swiss French with the French, and so on, even though they will often firmly deny so. Each language has its own set of TV channels, websites, newspapers and magazines with very little mixing between them. Attempts at multilingual television programs usually end up very, very awkwardly. Functional bilingualism or trilingualism in which people speak several national languages fluently is commonplace, but definitely not the norm, except maybe in federal politics. As you can guess, people who do have it enjoy a large advantage in employment.

The linguistic areas have different cultures, different worldviews, different ways of thinking and solving problems. The differences are not as huge as I'm making them sound, but present. They are compounded by the city vs. country split you will find elsewhere, and at times the differences are bigger between, say, the deepest mountain cantons and the urban ones than between the German and French ones.

Thankfully, the federal system allows each canton - and by extension, linguistic area and culture - to do their own thing in their corner within the framework of the Confederation and to decide together when laws/institutions/solutions have to be country-wide. That's what the federal government is for. That is also where you'll start to see some (bigger) clashes, because things have to be decided for the entire country and people inevitably start treading on other people's feet while doing so.",0,1392314413,null,0,1392314911,0,cfegww0,t3_1xpz2p,t1_cfegww0,t3_1xpz2p,null,1432382375,1,false,Switzerland,t5_2qhp6,1
