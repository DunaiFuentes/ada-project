true,whitepalms85,null,null,"No, I'm Swiss and I haven't studied politics either but I would explain it like that:

* Right wing: Supports inequality, think it's unavoidable or good as it gives an incentive to work hard or ""has always been like that"" 
* Left wing: Want social equality and think that inequality is unfair and has to be overcome.
* Liberal / progressive: Don't want government intervention but personal freedom (less regulation for business but also personal freedom e.g. gay rights, drugs legalization). They favor change because they believe it will lead to improvements
* Conservatives: They want the society to remain the same because they believe new things will make things worse. 


The SP and especially the unions clearly aren't liberal. E.g. the SP might be against the old family model because they think it's unfair (e.g. because they think women should also work / have similar rights =&gt; reduce inequality = left wing) but they want the government to regulate and intervene in the upbringing of children, which is clearly not liberal as it reduces personal freedom (= conservative).
The same with the unions: they don't want change or less government. They want more government and regulations. They like the way it is / was where unions where strong and therefore they dislike new things (e.g. technology as it replaces workers, or globalisation).
Same story with opening hours. The left wing parties used to be in favor of night clubs, bars for young people and so on in the 80s but now they are against long opening hours (= less personal freedom / conservative).

Liberal and progressive are not the same thing, conservatives can but don't have to be nationalistic. For example the definition of progressive changes as soon as the direction society moves towards changes. To give you another example: There is a distinction between classic and modern liberalism (eg. social welfare is accepted in modern but not in classic liberalism).


Also if you wanna compare political ideologies or parties you'll have to differentiate between pro and anti authoritarian (Facism would be the extreme pro authoritarian and anarchy the extreme anti authoritarian position).

true,malmostoso,ti,Ticino,"Radicalization is never a good thing. Looking at this data, the SVP is the only party that shifted enough to really talk about radicalization.

If the PS did the same thing it would be just as alarming, but it didn't. My explanation is that the PS already had a PdA which would gather the more radical views. The SVP on the other hand spawned the BDP which gathered the moderates, so what was left drifted more and more conservatively.

The biggest issue IMHO is that the voters of the SVP didn't seem to notice (or mind) this drift, and the SVP has been consistently gathering 30% of the votes: do the Swiss vote by habit? I believe yes, especially considering the low turnouts: only the most invested citizens bother going to vote, while all the others trust the system. Whether this is good or bad, it's another discussion :)

true,buyacasha,zh,Zürich,"Ah yes, I agree that radical view points are seldomly a good thing. However, I think it is interesting to see that on this chart, the SP is more radically left than the SVP is radically right. And by that logic, the SP has been as radical as they are now for decades and that would even be more alarming, would it not?

That is indeed interesting. I'm certain that some people vote by habit, but I really believe (and hope) that most vote based on individual issues. When it comes to voting for people though, I'm sure most vote by habit.
