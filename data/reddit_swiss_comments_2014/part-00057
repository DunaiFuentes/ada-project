&gt;[Participation to law making] can be achieve in two ways. Citizens can give their trust to some of them. Without giving away their right, they charge the exercise. It is for the common good that they give themselves Representatives, much more able than themselves to know the common good, and to interpret in this regard their own will.

&gt;The other way to exercise its right to making the Law, is to contribute oneself directly to it. This immediate participation is the hallmark of true democracy. Mediated participation refer to the representative Government. **The difference between these two political systems is enormous.**

Here is the original text, where he explain why France shouldn't be a democracy. The reasons invoked are that people are not educated enough and are rendered idiotic by brutal capitalism:

&gt;""Les Peuples Européens modernes ressemblent bien peu aux Peuple anciens. Il ne s'agit parmi nous que de Commerce, d'Agriculture, de Fabriques, etc. Le désir des richesses semblent de faire de tous les États de l'Europe que de vastes Ateliers: on y songe bien plus à la consommation et à la production qu'au bonheur. Aussi les systèmes politiques, aujourd'hui, sont exclusivement fondés sur le travail; les facultés productives de l'homme font tout; à peine fait-on mettre à profit les facultés morales, qui pourroient cependant devenir la source la plus féconde des plus véritable jouissances. Nous sommes donc forcés de ne voir, dans la plus grande partie des hommes, que des machines de travail.

&gt;Cependant vous ne pouvez pas refuser la qualité de Citoyen, et les droits du civisme, à cette multitude sans instruction, qu'un travail forcé absorbe en entier. Puisqu'ils doivent obéir à la Loi tout comme vous, ils doivent aussi, concourir à la faire. Ce concours doit être égal.

&gt;Il peut s'exercer de deux manières. Les Citoyens peuvent donner leur confiance à quelques-uns d'entre eux. Sans aliéner leur droits, ils en commettent l'exercice. C'est pour l'utilité commune qu'ils se nomment des Représentans, bien plus cabables qu'eux-même de connoître l'intérêt général, et d'interpréter à cet égard leur propre volonté.

&gt;L'autre manière d'exercer son Droit à la formation de la Loi, est de concourir soi-même immédiatement à la faire. Ce concours immédiat est ce qui caractérise la véritable démocratie. Le concours médiat désigne le Gouvernement représentatif. La différence entre ces deux systèmes politiques est énorme.

&gt;Le choix entre ces deux méthodes de faire la Loi, n'est pas douteux parmi nous:

&gt;D'abord, la très grande pluralité de nos Concitoyens n'a ni assez d'instruction, ni assez de loisir, pour vouloir s'occuper directement des Loix qui doivent gouverner la France; leur avis est donc de se nommer des Représentants; et puisque c'est l'avis du grand nombre, les hommes éclairés doivent s'y soumettre comme les autres. Quand une société est formée, on sait que l'avis de la pluralité fait Loi pour tous.""

Switzerland, and particularly the states with the Landsgemeinde are true historical singularities that have only a real correspondence with Athenian democracy.
