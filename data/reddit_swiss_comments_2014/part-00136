And in Switzerland this is considered to be acceptable. I'm so tired of people finding excuses for our racist culture. Switzerland is a racist country! Just look at the chart. I think racism is the biggest taboo topic in Swiss society. We all live in this constant denial of it.

I don't say these people do not exist, but that isn't really a big thing here. The biggest reason is the low unemployment rate.

Not all the right wing voters are racist (I'm not a left wing voter btw) but most of the SVP voters are (why else would they vote SVP? the whole point of SVP is hating foreigners). However, it's our culture that is tolerating racism. Most Swiss think that we are something better than everyone else on the planet and the fact that SVP isn't considered to be racist is very telling. Our standards for racism are very low. You pretty much have to wave a Nazi flag that people would call you a racist. If I say that 'all Germans are arrogant', most Swiss would agree (even in Zurich German bashing is considered to be acceptable). Show people outside Switzerland the SVP campaign pictures and ask them what they think? They will all tell you that it's clearly racist. Some other fascist parties actually use them as a role model. Again, UKIP in the UK is considered to be uneducated racists by almost everyone and their positions / campaigns on immigration are way less extreme than SVP.

&gt; I don't say these people do not exist, but that isn't really a big thing here.

This is exactly what I mean. 27% vote for a racists party and it's not a big thing?! How can the biggest party not be a big thing?

In this case you have to be a good hiker, plan a couple of nights in a hut and carefully plan in advance what you want to do.
