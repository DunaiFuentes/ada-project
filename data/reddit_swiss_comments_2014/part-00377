You were wondering how those who had their property destroyed are helped in such a situation.

I seriously doubt that 200 people together put the same car on fire. Our justice system doesn't work that way. You only are punished for stuff you personally did and not because you happened to be around.

&gt; That makes it even worse! So you're logic is the higher the damage the lower the punishment?

No, my logic is that we should focus on dealing with such situations in long-term solution which does benefit our society as a whole instead of using revenge fantasies which don't do any good beside making people feel better.

&gt; Which wouldn't matter in any case as long they are adults.

I'm not saying the parents should pay, but they aren't poor homeless people or so. 

&gt; And the only realistic solution is that insurance will pay the damage because even if the offender is caught, he most likely won't have the cash around to replace a BMW and we surely can't expect the victim to wait a decade till he pays it off, right?

That makes no sense. 1. not everyone has insurance against riots, it's rather uncommon. 2. insurance are just a pool of money, it still means that other people would have to pay for the damages the rioters caused. An insurance isn't some kind of magic company that creates money to pay for you damages or so. 3. Even if the insurance pays, they can still be held reliable, simply the insurance would have to wait longer if they can't pay (and again, why do you assume that they are poor, it's rather unlikely).

&gt; I seriously doubt that 200 people together put the same car on fire. Our justice system doesn't work that way. You only are punished for stuff you personally did and not because you happened to be around.

Well, if it was just one person, why wouldn't the person be held responsible? So can I just come to your house and destroy everything and that's okay, because I did it all on my own?

&gt; instead of using revenge fantasies

What are you talking about? They simply need to pay for the damage, I'm not even talking about sentences. 

&gt; That's why we have a rehabilitation justice system instead of a punishment based as you find in the US.

That's not how our system works. If you damage something, then you have to pay for it. You clearly don't understand our system. Sorry, but some people cause massive damages for no reason and you're telling me that they are the victims?! wft! 
And 'rehabilitation' would be instead of sending them to jail, sending them is some kind of training against extremism or so. That would be on top of the damage, not instead.",0,1418594377,null,0,false,0,cmuvrkc,t3_2p60ld,t1_cmuvrkc,t1_cmuulm5,null,1425434049,2,false,Switzerland,t5_2qhp6,2

false,DeepBlueNemesis,bs,Beide Basel,"This is not entirely accurate. It is true that anyone can launch a Betreibung on anyone without reason or proof, but what then happens is that you take a ""Rechtsvorschlag"". If you do that, both parties meet in front of a justice of the peace where they have to present proof that you owe them money (bills, warnings and the like). If they cannot provide that, the case is thrown out. You still have to become active to get your register statement clean again, which sucks.

The reason that it's this easy is so people actually *do* use the system when they are owed money. The only barrier is the cost you have to pay up front (around 35.- I believe), if you add too much to it people will just stop bothering for smaller amounts, which could become a burden for smaller businesses like carpenters or lock and key services.
