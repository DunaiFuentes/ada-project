That's actually a very strong argument against the Gripen but people don't seem to understand this: 

1. We don't have to spend money on anything. We could just not spend it and everyone would be better off. 

2. Even if we spend it, then money should be spend on something that is in the best interest of society (very unlikely true for the Gripen, considering we could spend it on research or building infrastructure, that would create jobs too and be a much better investment). 

3. The fact that we aren't buying parts from the best provider but from a Swiss one means that we're either paying too much or the quality will be bad. Either way, tax payer's money is used inefficiently. It's nothing but a subsidy.

4. Subsidizing these companies isn't in the interest of society but their shareholders. This companies then use the money from the tax payer to finance politicians that make sure that they will get even more tax money (rent seeking).

&gt;The __Saab JAS 39 Gripen__ (English: [Griffin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Griffin)  ) is a [light](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light_fighter) single-engine [multirole fighter aircraft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multirole_combat_aircraft) manufactured by the Swedish aerospace company [Saab](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saab_Group#Aeronautics). It was designed to replace the [Saab 35 Draken](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saab_35_Draken) and [37 Viggen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saab_37_Viggen) in the [Swedish Air Force](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swedish_Air_Force) (*Flygvapnet*). The Gripen has a [delta wing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delta_wing) and [canard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canard_(aeronautics\)) configuration with [relaxed stability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relaxed_stability) design and [fly-by-wire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fly-by-wire) flight controls. It is powered by the [Volvo RM12](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volvo_RM12), and has a top speed of [Mach](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mach_number) 2. Later aircraft are modified for [NATO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO) interoperability standards and to undertake [in-flight refuelling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerial_refueling).

People aren't really getting more stupid, they are actually getting better educated (e.g. 50 years ago most people thought that someone with a university degree is super smart and knows everything).

But politics in Switzerland has become more populist. Before the 90s the SP was the most populist, targeting uneducated workers but they were a minority and all the center-right wing parties (Bürgerliche) relatively reasonable. The Bürgerliche would make sure that our economy is doing well but make compromises with the SP when left wing ideas gained support (that's why Switzerland is rich and we have a good social system and not constant fights with unions and so on). 

However, in the 90s the SVP became more populist taking away voters from everyone including  the SP. The SP became a bit of a champagne socialist party. Most of their voters aren't uneducated workers anymore but academics and middle class. In reaction to the ""new SVP"" other parties had to become more populist too (e.g. even the FDP can be quite populist when it comes to immigration because they are scared of losing more voters to the SVP). Basically Blocher introduced populism to Switzerland and now everyone has to copy it...

&gt; now I see following center recommendation more

I'm not in a party or so and I don't follow the voting recommendations of a certain party but yes, SVP / SP / Grüne is pretty much all the same nonsense. It's simply a preference whether you want to blame the foreigners or the rich people for everything. But to be fair, SP / Grüne are a bit more reasonable (e.g. they helped to rescue UBS even though they hate them but they were reasonable enough to see that a failure would hurt them too, whereas the SVP can sometimes be just completely crazy.

I'm not sure to be honest but wages in Switzerland are less distributed than in other countries. So the poor aren't that poor compared to the rich. People in Switzerland are well educated and probably that's why wages are higher (even the unskilled aren't that unskilled as in other countries).

But it's complicated. Working poor depends on a lot of things, not just income. E.g. a lot of working poor are single mothers because children are expensive. But in Switzerland we have low teenage pregnancy rates so that might reduces the number of working poor.

That's true, but it all depends if you believe some military power is necessary or not. Having no army at all would definitely cost less to the tax payer.

&gt; The fact that we aren't buying parts from the best provider but from a Swiss one means that we're either paying too much or the quality will be bad. Either way, tax payer's money is used inefficiently. It's nothing but a subsidy.

This is not necessarily true. As an example, RUAG has been the manufacturer of the fuel tanks of the French Rafale aircraft (and also Gripen) for a couple a years now. There is some industrial expertise in Switzerland and foreign firms that need to outsource some of their work know this.

But I see where you are going, and I mostly agree with you (also with you last paragraph). Particularly, Brazil has also selected Gripen recently, and they have a well recognized aeronautical industry. I have little doubt that they would not be able to produce needed part with similar quality at a better price. I also believe a competitive industry has to innovate to stay competitive on the long term, and if they can't they just deserve to disappear.

Thanks, I feel better now. Was kind of afraid that I would end up voting SVP if my ""voting more to the right"" trend would continue :P

&gt; Basically Blocher introduced populism to Switzerland and now everyone has to copy it...

That's a shame, really. I don't see the point of having a direct democracy anymore if populism becomes ""The"" way to set up an army of zombie voters and take full advantage of it.

&gt; I'm not in a party or so and I don't follow the voting recommendations 
Oh yes, me neither. I do vote objects on an individual basis, but I also recognize that I tend to agree more with center/center right parties than in the past.

**Hausartzt**: **Yes**, uncontroversial.

**Pedobear**: **No**, automatic punishment seems too harsh, and I fear it may lead to a US-like ""sex offender"" registry, which is absolutely awful. (that last argument is fairly weak, I know...)

**Mindestlohn**: **Yes**, I think being able to live rather than survive on your wage is a fundamental right. Sure, some places have it worse than others, but having location-based minimum wages inside an already small country would create an extremely odd system that would probably cause a lot of trouble.  
On a more factual basis, there isn't much evidence that minimum wages are harmful (or useful, for that matter) to the economy, and the right-wing arguments seems to be the same ones they use every time there's something they don't like, which tells me they don't have actual arguments. ""I studied economy and..."" isn't an argument, it's your own personal opinion.  
Finally, even if it fails, I'd much rather have ""populist"" initiatives be about people's rights, equality and fairness (even if they're too extreme and I vote against them) than about fear and hate (e.g. most SVP initiatives).

**Gripen**: **No**, there is absolutely no reason for Switzerland to invest money in our army, if we get invaded we'll be crushed anyway.

*VD-specific*:

**Sauver Lavaux III**: **No** to the initiative, **yes** to the *contre-projet* (what's the English word for that? counter-project?). Banning any and all constructions is absurd, but the *contre-projet* seems to be uncontroversial.  
Unsurprisingly, the only mainstream party for the initiative is the Green Party, a.k.a. the ""science or people don't matter, nature must be worshipped at all costs"" party.
