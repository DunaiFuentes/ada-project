* DP (although we're in the top 8): *Pressures on the population such as disease and natural disasters make it difficult for the government to protect its citizens or demonstrate a lack of capacity or will*
* GG (+0.6 since 2009, +1.5 since 2006): *When tension and violence exists between groups, the state’s ability to provide security is undermined and fear and further violence may ensue.*
* HF: *When there is little opportunity, people migrate, leaving a vacuum of human capital. Those with resources also often leave before, or just as, conflict erupts.*
* UED: *When there are ethnic, religious, or regional disparities, governments tend to be uneven in their commitment to the social contract.*
* ECO (although we're in the top 7): *Poverty and economic decline strain the ability of the state to provide for its citizens if they cannot provide for themselves and can create friction between the “haves” and the “have nots”.*

Also within the top 20 most worsened countries for 2014 were Switzerland, the Netherlands, Sweden, and Austria.* (page 11)
