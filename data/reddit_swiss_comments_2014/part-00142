Since you'll have to take German language courses as a part of your studies, you should take full advantage of this.  Do not, however, limit yourself only to the German spoken in the classroom.

I, for example, took a one month intensive German course when I arrived in Switzerland.  When the month was over, I felt pretty damned good about myself, so I went to the grocery store to try out my new language.  Unfortunately, everyone's replies seemed to come in a different language.  Turns out, while most everybody *can* speak high German, the Swiss actually speak their own dialects of the language.  

Do not be put out by this.  You can take a course at Migrosklubschule to learn Swiss German, or--and this is the easier option--go to Orrell Füssli (popular bookstore chain) and purchase the book, *Hoi, your Swiss German survival guide.*  Don't be alarmed, most people here will just be ecstatic if you learn German, but you'll go a bit farther with the locals if you can understand them in their own dialect.

What are they planning to with that? This is exactly the useless cold war stuff I'm talking about. We don't need know-how about that because Switzerland won't fight in a war with those tanks ever.

true,whitepalms85,null,null,"What's 'a large amount'? I think the limit is 20k for what you can bring to Switzerland without having to declare it. Everything below that shouldn't be a problem. You can just bring such an amount to Switzerland and not report it on your tax statement. Of course that would be illegal and therefore not my advice. However, it's not very likely that someone will ever find out as you could just spend the 20k on normal things (buy a new TV, expensive cloths, go out and have fun... just pay everything in cash). 


If it's above 20k it gets complicated. I'm not sure if a US bank would accept a high amount without asking questions especially if you want to transfer it to Switzerland. However, because of the banking secret the Swiss tax authorities wouldn't find out if the money ends up on a Swiss bank account (at least not for now, but the law might changes in a few years.).
A lot of rich people that move untaxed money use goods now. E.g. you buy art, jewelry or expensive watches in the US and then sell them in Switzerland again (prearranged, basically you're just carrying it over the board and claim that the watch was a gift or so). Some use free zone warehouse (Zollfreilager) so the good basically never leaves or enters a country from a legal perspective and therefore custom (and hence taxes) aren't involved. The goods are basically just moved in a grey zone between countries.
