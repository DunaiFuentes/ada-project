In terms of financial services you'd probably be looking more Zurich and Zug way, which are German speaking (you really only need English). The only realistic way of achieving this would be from an international company, and in that case, you'd need to know someone who works there. Most of my friends have achieved internships at Glen core and Pilautus to name a few, although through family. Your best bet is to send some e-mails and explain your whole situation, that would get you the best response.

One final note, do you know anyone who works in a company like this? In this world it's not what you know, it's who you know, from my experience at least. Good luck!",0,1416173548,null,0,false,0,cm4denl,t3_2maxt5,t1_cm4denl,t3_2maxt5,null,1425994110,2,false,Switzerland,t5_2qhp6,2

false,caladan84,cern,CERN BE,"I am not an expert, but I'm using shielding for electronics I design. Please don't treat the things I write as an absolute knowledge. Note as well that the shielding you need depends on the spectrum of the particles that you want to shield against and radiation levels your equipment can withstand. 

1. We use concrete, a lot of concrete. All the passages for people, all these tiny ""room"" to hide, all the chicanes are made with concrete. In CTF3 (I work for CLIC) the whole building is surrounded by a at least 4 m thick concrete slabs. Beam dumps in CTF3 are made with concrete (outside), but I think they have lead or other metal inside. As far as I understand concrete is cheap, available in huge amounts, easy to shape and is not easily activated. It's also moderately dense and that counts for Total Ionizing Dose (TID). There's also High Energy Hadron fluence (HEH) (causing Single Effect Upsets) but I have no idea how does concrete cope with this one.

2. We use iron. Iron is dense (so heavy as well) but sufferes from activation. If I understand well there are accelerators (like SPS) that after many years of service are quite radioactive. I may be wrong but I think iron is being transmuted to cobalt and cobalt is well know for being used in medical radiation sources.

3. I think we sometime use lead. Lead is extremely heavy, it's better at shielding from TID than iron ~2.5 times. On the other hand it's really heavy - and often weight of shielding has to be considered as well for mechanical reasons. I think it's used only in places where it's not possible to move sensitive parts away. 

4. For Si-displacement (damage to the crystal lattice) boron-polyethylene is sometimes used, but I know it doesn't absorb beyond some energies. Usually it just covers the other shielding material, I don't think it is used alone. 

As somebody else mentioned - the distance counts as well because the energy spreads on a bigger surface/in a bigger volume. Quite often we place near the beam pipe only the instruments that can't be moved elsewhere. The usual approach is to move sensitive equipment to a different room/tunnel and use tunnel casing and dirt as a shield.
