The only thing I can hold against it is the fact (or shall I say 'the hope') that things would be discussed more deeply by the people if they were used to make all the decisions. At least there would be a platform to discuss such matters. Now there isn't one single platform.

To go beyond that requires a lot of commitment.

Yes, there is a lot still to do (the professionals, in my humble opinion, should not be paid by companies, for instance, and there should be even more transparency of the info they get from interested parties etc... but that's about it).

If you do not have that, direct democracy is like a fight at school where a group of strong kids kicks the weak kid, and there's no one around to help. Because you can't change human nature. The majority does not want to pay taxes for the poor. It does not want to pay taxes for the best Railway and public transport system in the world. It does not want to pay money for one of the best education systems in the world. It's everyone and their own front yard, that's what ""the most direct democracy"" boils down to.

What you've done so far, shows your determination, and shurely will come in handy when applying for jobs here (be shure to mention them in a motivational letter along with your applications). I think, to get a work permit, you will need to already have an working contract, along with lots of other formalities with immigration authorities.

This is not paradise. Be aware that beginning here will be tough. Financially, workwise and also socially. I don't know if South African apprenticeships are acknowledged here. If not, you might have to start with some kind of an internship to prove your skills. Without an acknowledged degree, but beeing a good workforce, it is likely that your employer will try to exploit your position and keep you working at a minimum wage. Once you have employment, be shure to keep prospects (as further training) open and see that your employer supports this. My uncle came here in the 90's from Ex-Yugoslavia beeing an electrical engineer and had to start as an electrician from bottom up. It was hard for him earning a good status in his company, in his community and also with the immigration departement.

Never the less, I wish you best of luck and a lot of energy because what you want is not easy to achieve. Be determined; if you want it, you can do it.

Try to get some connections. A few things come into my mind:

First and most obvious: Apply for jobs to test the echo. Find out what you're qualified for, so you apply for the right job. A starting point would be the the swiss plumbing union, they must know what's a start for you, plus they can tell you about the acknowledgement of your apprenticeship. [www.vssh.ch](http://www.vssh.ch/)

Second, try to get in touch with SA communities. There are certainly communities in all bigger cities in Switzerland. Maybe they can be some help, maybe also you find a plumber already working here, who could tell you his experiences.

Another interesting thing to do would be to apply for Swiss human aid projects working in Africa. The barrier to work for them as a plumber might be lower than for regular businesses here. They always search for skilled people, only that they obviosly don't pay a lot or even nothing. However it could be a way to get in contact with work colleages from Switzerland and also to get references for your future applications.
