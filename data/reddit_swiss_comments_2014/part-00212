Every supermarket has a big sortiment with fresh fruits and vegetables (only small sortiments and lower quality in Denner and the german discounters, but fortunately they do control only 4% of the market [germany: 45%]). There are dozens of product lines for vegeterians like Délicorn in Coop supermarket or Cornatur in Migros. A lot of food is produced under swiss laws, not the slack european ones. The best to buy you will find in a more expensive Reformhaus. Every town has a morning fruit and vegetable market with regional products. The protection of animals is considered to be the most restrictive in western hemisphere. They have one of the lowest meat consumation rates of Europe (50kg p.p., equal only to Finland, Denmark and poor eastern Europe). For every restaurant, no matter how small or how far in the back of beyond, it's self-evident that they do provide at least one vegetarian menu, usually there's more. 

However it is true that if you are in the take-away-thing, then sandwiches with eggs, mozarella, tomatoes, salad, gherkins and emmentaler really are pretty much the only thing you are gonna eat :D Have fun!

The train will get you anywhere, but it will be expensive unless you get a pass that's valid in the whole country and for almost any public transports (including boats :p). Geneva - Zürich would take about 2h30/3h00 I'd say.

From Geneva, a trip on the lake ([on a ""Belle Époque"" steamer](https://imgur.com/NSudSLi)) is almost always a nice thing to do imo. The view is pretty nice and the steamers themselves are beautiful. You used to see the whole machinery in the middle and sometimes go down in the engine room but now it's closed to public I think (seeing those huge arms going up and down is pretty impressive).

There's the IOC museum in Lausanne which is about 45 minutes from Geneva (in train again). I haven't been there since they re-opened it but  I hear nothing but great things about it.

In the end, a swiss pass would be just awesome if you plan on taking public transportations a lot, otherwise it might ruin you.

true,t0t0zenerd,vd,Vaud,"There's definitely a sense of being more open to the outside world, and in particular to Europe, here in Suisse romande than over across the Saane. I mean, just look at the recent vote on mass immigration: cities everywhere voted for immigration, but German-speaking suburbs and countryside voted against while French-speaking suburbs and countryside voted for.

I've read that one of the possible reasons for this was that us Romands are used to being minorities: we are a minority in Switzerland and in the French-speaking world. So we are very attached to federalism -- Vaud in particular has a traditionally very strong rejection of federal power -- but can live with being ruled from Brussels rather than Bern. To give an example, the idea that European judges rather than Swiss ones might apply the human rights laws in Swiss matters is utterly uncontroversial here, while it is a typical SVP outrage-creator over in Alemannic Switzerland. German-speakers, however, are used to being a majority in Switzerland, to be the norm, and the fact they are seen as a very small part of the German speaking lands by the Germans kinda annoys them.

Here are the answers to your other questions.

&gt;how do you see your neighbours?

We have a very strong rivalry with France. Well, it's actually pretty one-sided considering most French people have only vaguely heard of us. In any case, though, it is very common to hear things like ""watching TF1 news is a daily reminder of how lucky we are to live in Switzerland"", ""if we were French we'd already be striking at this point"", or generally whenever discussing an aspect of the Swiss system - from education to pensions to healthcare - ""it's not like in France where (*insert much worse situation*)"". This can also get more toxic, in particular when talking about border-crossing workers. In Geneva in particular, a lot of people have real, unironical prejudices against French people than can be called racist. The MCG is basically created on the principle ""fuck border-crossing French, they take our jobs and our parking places, create traffic and take advantage of our economy and infrastructures"" and is one of the most popular parties in Geneva. But in most other places it's more of a friendly rivalry.

However, for all the rivalry, we are very, very influenced by French culture. We tend to have the same popular musicians, the same Internet comics (except for 120 secondes, which you must absolutely watch if you want an insight in the Romand perspective), the same jokes, a lot of the same culture. But we still definitely feel like France is more foreign than, say, Zurich. We have different currency, strongly different accents, different ways of counting, different favourite sports (hockey is more popular than football here).

To go back to the culture theme, Romandie definitely uses its place in a smaller country to have a weight that is absolutely disproportionate to its size. The theatre de Vidy, the Genevan Comédie or the Bâtie have calendars you'd expect in cities like Marseille or Lyon, which are 4 or 5x bigger. Same in music: the Montreux Jazz and the Paléo are among the biggest festivals in French-speaking lands, and that's not speaking about Caribana, Caprices, Rock Oz'Arènes, Festi'Neuch or Chant du Gros, all of which are capable of attracting reasonably big stars. Cully Jazz and Luna Classics are also big in their particular circles. And this for a territory of 1.5 million inhabitants!

As for the other neighbours: we see Alemannic Germans as different depending on where they come from. Basel is considered as honorary Romands: they aren't stuck up, are open on the rest of the world and drink wine in their *apéros*. Zurchers stereotypically see Suisse Romande as some kind of overseas territory not worthy of much interest, hence why they'd rather teach English. This is alright until, as happens every so often, one of them buys a Romand company and feels like they have to explain to these natives how their job is done. The rest of the country is the backwoods rednecks who vote for Blocher and against minarets, who are afraid of foreigners despite having seen one Italian in their entire life. The really stereotypical *Bourbine* is mostly this, with a side of being an absolute stickler for regulations and never letting his hair down. We pride ourselves on being more relaxed, on having workplace *apéros*, and yet on having high productivity. We aren't French!",0,1406243149,null,0,1406244637,1,cj6xozs,t3_2blkg2,t1_cj6xozs,t3_2blkg2,null,1434884409,14,false,Switzerland,t5_2qhp6,14
true,t0t0zenerd,vd,Vaud,"I'll continue the answer here since I'm afraid of running out of space.

Onto the music. There isn't that much Romand music. As mentioned elsewhere, the most famous artist is probably Stress. Traditionally, the big guy in Vaud is Jean Villard-Gilles, usually just called Gilles. He wrote many songs about Vaud and the local countryside and customs. But he's definitely something over-40s speak of, not an artist reddit's demographic will have in mind. Aside from that, *Le Beau Lac de Bâle* is a parody group that's pretty fun. 

Culturally, the Romandie prides itself on its writers. The greatest is Charles-Ferdinand Ramuz, whose texts draw heavily on localism and a specific local vocabulary. His literary philosophy is also very much influenced by his upbringing in Lausanne. *Derborence* and *La Beauté sur la Terre* are probably among his greatest works. He's not easy to get into though, definitely not pop literature. Jacques Chessex is the only Swiss writer to have received the Goncourt prize, the biggest literary prize in the French-speaking world. And there are many others such as Ella Maillart, Corinna Bille, Nicolas Bouvier, Maurice Chappaz, Anne Cuneo. One can also mention Alexandre Voisard, whose poems were among the greatest vectors of the Jura independence movement, or Benjamin Constant and Germaine de Staël, who led revolutionary discourse in Coppet. Blaise Cendrars and, especially, Jean-Jacques Rousseau are among the greatest ever French language writers but neither considered himself Swiss, despite being born in La Chaux-de-Fonds for one and Geneva for the other. Voltaire also lived in Geneva for 10 years and in its suburbs for 30 more.

Ok one last thing before I go sleep (I'll continue updating my answer tomorrow don't worry): here are the stereotypes we have on each other in Romandie.

* Genevans are loud, aggressive, brash, obnoxious and essentially French. The GE on their licence plates is supposed to stand for Gueules Élastiques - elastic mouths. Their semi-official nickname is the Bigmouths - les grandes gueules.

* Valaisans are always drunk or in the process of getting drunk on Fendant or Petite Arvine. They have a mullet, are outspoken and have probably already corrupted a federal agent once to build a chalet for a Russian oligarch. If they come from the valleys, they are the product of incest.

* Vaudois are the Bernese of Romandie: they are slow, a bit peasant and frankly a bit thick. They are often in the process of getting drunk on Chasselas. Their motto is ""y en a point comme nous"" - there aren't any others like us - and they honestly believe Lavaux is the most beautiful region in the world. They consider that all that is to be seen in the world is in canton Vaud.

* Fribourgeois are Catholic. Very catholic. They live in families with 11 kids, go to mass every Sunday and do Lent. They also get hammered at the Gottéron games every time there is one since there's fuck all else to do. They are also poor and, especially, filthy.

* Neuchâtelois don't really have many stereotypes about them. Those from the Bas (lakeside, Neuchatel city) hate those from the Haut (mountains, La Chaux and Le Locle). Those from the Bas are half-Vaudois, those from the Haut half-Jurassian.

* Jurassians used to work in the watchmaking industry but are unemployed now. They are on welfare and watch their kids go to Vaud or Geneva for employment. Also their accent is the funniest of all.
