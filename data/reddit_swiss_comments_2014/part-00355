The Enemy from Inside

The financial press of March 18, 1997, announced how a study group of the Swiss Department of Finance and the SNB had worked out proposals for a more profitable management of the Bank’s currency reserves, in other words, they had graduated to the modern central bank portfolio theory. In it’s 90th Annual Report closing December 31, 1997, the SNB gives an absolutely unsatisfactory explanation for lowering the gold reserve requirement. It said that the reduction to 25% was necessary because otherwise the gold lending activities would have compromised the SNB by violating the legal limits. Such a justification is hard to believe, but what is even harder to believe is that the SNB should resort to such a bogus explanation.

For me, a Swiss citizen whose family is Swiss on both parents side for as long as there are written records, this was betrayal. It was completely against Swiss traditional thinking and behavior. We Swiss have always been slow to adopt new foreign procedures, and, in particular, revolutions of such a fundamental nature. Of cource, there was the constant lameting and influencing by a destructive media. There is no doubt in my mind, however, that the main instigators for the change of mind came from overseas. Some foreign master planners with great experience and full of brilliant tactics must have suggested this course of action to Swiss central bankers, making this caper the envy of Clausewits or Sun-Tzu had they been alive. For the foreign manipulators, the last gold-backed currency, the Swiss Franc, was the only remaining obstacle to be removed from the path to the fairyland of a global fiat currency. Who needs a small country in the middle of the Alps to have the impertinence to own all that gold and to have the best currency? The treasure in the mountains had to be taken by an unususal maneuver.

When reading the following paragraphs, one should keep in mind that the main arena in which these events took place remained to be the war against gold. There is nothing else that worries the would-be masters of the world more than the power of gold. Throughout history there were many ambitious politicians who wanted to become the master of the universe. Today this dream still prevails in some arrogant minds. In order to create a world with one government, on central bank and one currency, the biggest and most important obstacle in the path of attaining that goal must be destroyed, and that is gold.

However, and as said before, the war against Switzerland, or the battle for the Swiss gold, was already won 1992, when the country joined the IMF. That was the decisive moment when the usually prudent and historically solid Swiss did not pay attention. What was to follow could be achieved relatively easily by the powerbrokers.",0,1416993833,null,0,false,0,cmdg5jo,t3_2n0xqx,t1_cmdg5jo,t1_cmdfxaw,null,1425834139,1,false,Switzerland,t5_2qhp6,1

&gt;Despite being basically half-German, half-French, and half-whatever-the-hell Romansh is

Ignoring Italian and the fact that Romansh is a small minority.

&gt; somehow systematically managed to avoid every major armed conflict of the last two hundred or so years

Actually, literally 200 years. The last major conflict we were involved in were the Napoleonic Wars, which ended 1814 with the guarantee of our territory by the Coalition if we would remain neutral and function as a buffer state between Austria and France.

Then the next entire paragraph is simply wrong. The reasons why we were not involved in the wars mentioned were complicated and nuanced, our armed forces had little to do with it. That is just ""Geistige Landesverteidigung"" in a nutshell. 

And the cold war is over. The number of men with military training and with their guns at home is decreasing fast.

&gt; badassitude 

Seriously.

&gt;Swiss Pikemen were the single most badass infantry formation the world had ever seen

A bold claim. I'm pretty sure there were other types of infantry that were as famous as the Swiss formations. However it is true that Swiss mercenaries were widely used in the late middle ages. In this time the majority of armies were a majority mercenaries. Forced conscription was being phased out and standing armies came only later.

&gt; who got the opportunity to hire them.

Actually, everyone hired them. In many conflicts both armies had one or more Swiss brigades in them. For example in the Spanish War of Succession or the war between Milan and France. 

&gt;The story starts in the 1300s, when Switzerland was part of the Holy Roman Empire 

True.

&gt; Swiss Cantons (basically city-states)

Nope. That's an extreme simplification. Zurich was a ""Zunftstadt"", Berne was lead by patricians, Uri, Schwyz and Nidwalden were ""Landsgemeinden"". Basel and St. Gallen were owned by Bishops. Parts of it were owned by the Habsburgs, Neuchatel was a Principality, Tessin, Schaffhausen, Vaud, Aarau, Solothurn, Jura were subjects of either one or several cantons. And it's a lot more complicated than that and changed a lot from 1300 - 1848.

&gt; fuck feudalism

Nope. It is first a silly statement as Feudalism entails political, economical and economic elements. You can't just get rid of it. The Ancien Régime was still a feudal society abolished by Napoleon by force.

&gt; having an Emperor sucks,

Exactly the opposite happened. The Swiss Cantons pledged direct allegiance to the Emperor to be independent from local feudal lords (Habsburgs and others). 

&gt; we just wanna do our own thing and be left alone. 

Nope. We were highly involved in European politics and wars. Until 

&gt; There was no overarching president

Well of course, there were no presidents at all until the USA came into existence. 

&gt; every man was a citizen-soldier who was trained in militia tactics

Some maybe. But hardly everyone. The relationships of people were very complex in middle age and late middle age societies. And things differed greatly between the Cantons. Berne was very expansionist, while Zurich was mostly interested in keeping what they had.

&gt;and even though they were still technically part of the Holy Roman Empire, Switzerland was pretty much its own thing.  

The old Swiss confederation left the HRE in 1648 with the treaties of Westphalia. So they were very much part of it beforehand and not that special. Other regions of the HRE had similar privileges. 

Then from here it gets worse.

Leopold III. of Austria wasn't the Emperor. At the time the Hohenzollern family lead the empire, which gave ""Reichsfreiheit"" to some Swiss cities and ""Landsgemeinden"" due to their strategic trade interest. 

He simply wanted to increase his influence in the region. Which the Swiss surprisingly managed to prevent. So this part isn't entirely wrong. Which was part of the reason why the Swiss had a reputation.

Then the Burgundian wars were not just fought by the Swiss, but also by the French and the Austrians. Most battles in this war didn't involve Swiss soldiers at all, however the last battle at Nancy where he Charles the Bold died was mainly won by the Swiss and this was quite a shock to the European Powers as these peasants were able to defeat a noble. This helped tremendously in creating a Swiss position. 

There are probably more mistakes, but he is right about the battles he describes. Just often not about the reasons they took place. 

And the language. Just cringe-worthy.
