You could buy a [Swiss Pass](http://www.swiss-pass.ch) which gives you unlimited access to the whole public transport system of Switzerland, every train, all the buses and ships (I think they're included as well).

From Zurich, with only a one-hour train ride, you can reach Lucerne, Bern, Basel, and St.Gallen. Approximately two hours will get you to Graubünden, or into the beautiful Valleys of Lauterbrunnen or Kandersteg.. 

So, I cannot tell you what you should visit or what is an absolute must-see in Zurich, but I can highly recommend the Swiss Pass.
