false,Aethec,vd,Vaud,"&gt; I think there is some merit to competition, and I would actually be in favor of a state-administered alternative to the private insurers to keep them on their toes. One disadvantage of publicly-traded insurance companies is that they are pressured by their shareholders to make a profit, and guess out of who's pocket it will have to come.

IMHO, the main problem of a ""public alternative"" for insurance is that since this public alternative would need to treat everybody equally, it'd end up insuring only people that have a bigger-than-average risk of getting sick since private companies try as much as they can to attract low-risk people and get high-risk people out. The insurance would either collapse because of its debts or have a higher-than-average payment, which isn't good either.

It's the same thing happening with public and private postal services: the private services don't deserve remote areas (or they use the public services to do so), which allows them to be cheaper than the public service, and yet that public service is needed because otherwise remote areas won't be deserved at all.
