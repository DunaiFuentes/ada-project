true,friedMike,zh,Zürich,"Welcome to Switzerland :) I'm sure you'll love it here!

First off, there is a big expat community at www.englishforum.ch - they can probably answer your more specific questions. I work in a completely different field, so I can only give you more general answers.

&gt; So first I need to know how does the health system works for EU citizens.

As far as healthcare goes - [everyone is required to purchase a mandatory private healthcare](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care_in_Switzerland). It costs about 200-300 CHF per month (depending on the level of coverage) and usually excludes stuff like optical or dental (dental care is crazy expensive here, your best bet is to take a trip home every now and then and just do everything in Poland - a round-trip plane ticket to Warsaw will cost you ~300CHF, if you want to be really scrappy IIRC you can get a bus from Zurich to Poznan (via Munich and Berlin) for like 40CHF one-way too - it takes 24h to get there, though ;) )

Back to the point - There are many different healthcare providers in Switzerland. As far as basic coverage goes, they don't really differ that much. You can compare them at http://en.comparis.ch/.

&gt; When I'll be back, I'll need to get a working visa,

Well, technically, you have exactly 8 days to register at the Kreisburo (a bureau akin to, I dunno, urzad miejski? They handle immigration as well) after you arrive in Switzerland. Hovewer, quick Googling reveals that there are special rules governing au pairs ([here is the relevant legal act](http://www.admin.ch/opc/de/classified-compilation/20070993/index.html) if I'm correct). It means you will be granted an L permit (a short-stay permit). It also means that your host family has to provide language lessons for you (or cover 50% of the cost - the Internet is not clear here). I don't think you can find free German courses here. 

&gt; And, what are my rights as EU citizen?

Well, I dunno :) this is a ridiculously safe country. No-one is going to harass you for no reason.

&gt; Any suggestions on what bank account should I get?

There are multiple options. You have the more ""expat-oriented"" banks such as UBS which provide service in English but are more expensive, and also banks like PostFinance (Bank Pocztowy lol :) ) that are super-cheap but good luck using English there. There is also your local cantonal bank, which should also be relatively cheap.",0,1401794986,null,0,1401795446,0,chxyokw,t3_276uti,t1_chxyokw,t1_chxydup,null,1434073112,3,false,Switzerland,t5_2qhp6,3
