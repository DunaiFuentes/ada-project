I guess we all have the same sentiment here that some guy selling banking data to a foreign country and a guy blowing the whistle on wrong-doing by our Government are two very different things.

Switzerland actually has interesting and proud history of Government whistle-blowers. In the 70s the Swiss nuclear weapons program was revealed and quickly dismantled. In the 80s (not sure) the federal police's abusive data gathering of citizens was revealed and also dismantled.
