There are lots of beautiful cities in Switzerland. I would recommend Zurich, Lucerne or Lausanne. You will probably want to see some mountains. A popular destination is the Jungfraujoch. A very unique experience would be to take the Glacier Express from Zermatt to St.Moritz (or vice versa). It's a six hour train journey with lots of goregous scenery, bridges and tunnels. Also, Zermatt and St.Moritz are both worth seeing. Switzerland is pretty small, so you can get almost everywhere with a few hours of train travel. If you want to go hiking there is lots of routes of various ""difficulties"" almost everywhere which are always signposted really well.
