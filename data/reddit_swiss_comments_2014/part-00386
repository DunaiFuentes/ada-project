What is this based on? Proven scarcity? Just because something is scarce does not make it an accepted currency or good investment. What you need is the belief by people that a currency is worth something.
Gold has been worth something throughout history and has never lost it's value. Additionally, it is used in industry processes and will for that reason alone never completely lose it's value. The swiss franc is backed by the state, economy, it's people and the federal bank doing everything it can to preserve it's value. Bitcoin is backed solely on the wishful thinking of those that invest in it. Now as cool as it is, maybe this idea will take off in the future, maybe it will not.

You are right, and I am not claiming that value follows from scarcity. It is worth what people believe it is, no question about that. In bitcoin's case, many people already do believe it is worth something. For good reasons, too, because it has all the good properties of gold, but more and better: i.e.:

- its scarcity is fixed, but new gold is minted every year with no definite end in sight. 
- Bitcoin is unforgeable, while gold has been forged a lot of times. 
- You can split up and spend your bitcoin worldwide instantly at almost no cost, while moving gold is hugely expensive and inefficient. 
- Lastly, Bitcoin is the only money in existence which you can truely own. Paper fiat money? Can be declared invalid or made worthless by delibarate inflation by the govermnment. Money at the bank? Just numbers, no full reserve (not all people could withdraw at the same time in bank runs); can be confiscated at any time. Etc.

Many of those properties are truly novel, and highly desriable. Of course it is not as safe a bet as gold (yet), but still very promising. Which is all I said in my original post.

That the common people have power over Bitcoin and not goverments is a really cool thing too. This could potentially lift poor third world country out poverty, since they can evade corruption and get connected to the global economy cheaply and safely.",0,1419263867,null,0,1419264432,0,cn29llq,t3_2q1znu,t1_cn29llq,t1_cn28nfc,null,1425271840,1,false,Switzerland,t5_2qhp6,1
