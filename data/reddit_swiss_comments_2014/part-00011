Bürgerrechtsgesetz

Art. 1

Durch Abstammung

1 Schweizer Bürgerin oder Bürger ist von Geburt an:

a.
    das Kind, dessen Eltern miteinander verheiratet sind und dessen Vater oder Mutter Schweizer Bürgerin oder Bürger ist;
b.
    das Kind einer Schweizer Bürgerin, die mit dem Vater nicht verheiratet ist.

**2 Das minderjährige ausländische Kind eines schweizerischen Vaters, der mit der Mutter nicht verheiratet ist, erwirbt das Schweizer Bürgerrecht, wie wenn der Erwerb mit der Geburt erfolgt wäre, durch die Begründung des Kindesverhältnisses zum Vater.**

[...]

(emphasis mine)

The person acquires Swiss citizenship if he/she is a minor (under 18) at the time when fatherhood was legally established (either because it was declared by the father [Art. 260 ZGB] or through a paternity suit [""Vaterschaftsklage"", Art. 261]).

- **Make sure that the man in question is her *legal father*.**

2 possibilities there:

a. She already has a legal father: in this case you'll have to cancel the existing filiation, and have him recognize your cousin. If that's the case, you'll need a lawyer...

b. She has no legal father: The man has to recognize her in the country where she lives in (art. 71 [International Private Law Act](http://www.admin.ch/opc/fr/classified-compilation/19870312/index.html)). 

When this is done, it will depend on her age:

- **How old is she?**

a. *&lt; 22 y.o.*

In that case, she will be granted automatically the Swiss nationality when the filiation with the man will be established (art. 1 al. 1 + 10 al. 1 [Citizenship Act](http://www.admin.ch/opc/en/classified-compilation/19520208/index.html))

b. *Between 22 and 32 yo*

It will not be automatic, she'll have to ask for a *reintegration*, which is just a verification process to check if all the facts you mentioned are correct. If there's no reason to doubt that she didn't know that her father was swiss, it will be easy (art. 10 + 21 al. 1 Citizenship Act).

b. *Over 32 y.o.*

She'll have to prove in addition that she has ""strong ties"" with Switzerland (art. 21 al. 2 Citizenship Act). That might be acquired if she speaks one national language, decides to live there for a certain period of time and so on...
