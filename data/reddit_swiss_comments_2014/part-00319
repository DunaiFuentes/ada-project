false,P1r4nha,zh,Zürich,"I know we have another Ecopop discussion (or rather a list of people that try to outdo each other at explaining how stupid the initiative is) in another thread, but I wanted to ask a few questions about the claims of the Ecopop group regarding the problems caused by immigration.

I honestly don't notice many problems with immigrants at this point, but I might live in a bubble in central Zurich. Maybe the situation is much worse outside of my environment.

What I notice is this: We don't have enough cheap housing in Zurich, but recently I've seen a report that housing prices will go down in the Romandie and with the exception of Zurich the situation isn't really dire. We still have space, people are still building new houses in suburbs etc.

There are traffic jams and trains are quite full sometimes. I still think it's within comfortable limits though. Yeah, traffic sucks, but it's what you get for choosing a long commute. Our transportation infrastructure is still extraordinary, our streets the cleanest and best maintained in.. most parts of the world for sure.

I have clean drinking water wherever I go, the city smells fine, there is no problem with waste water. There is no problem with waste, we don't have landfills. There is enough energy, we even consider turning off our nuclear power plants and are looking for alternative power sources. A challenging project, but it doesn't look as if we reached any kind of limit.

Criminality doesn't go up significantly, in fact it still goes down. Foreigners are only more likely to commit crimes because they are from a lower socio-economic background. German immigrants with high-paying jobs don't commit more crimes for instance.

The unemployment rate is still at a record low. It's not perfect with winter unemployment for construction workers (mostly immigrants) and old people having a hard time to get jobs, but it's far from being a worry.

So I really don't know what kind of natural resources or standard of living we're supposed to protect with this initiative. The worries of the supporters of immigration quotas and these new very strict limits go over my head completely. I don't understand the xenophobia one bit, because other than somebody not being able to speak Swiss German without an accent I don't even notice immigrants.

A large part of our economy is dependent on a well-educated work force. It's not just the financial sector, it's also the pharmaceutical industry (mentioned with the head of Roche) and tech industry (Google has big headquarters here for instance but also many others). With as strict immigration limits as the initiative suggests, these sectors have to worry about getting enough immigrants into the country to satisfy their needs.

That's just one aspect, but that's where most of the money hinges on, in my opinion.

We're not only dependent on highly educated people for instance. Hospital staff and other jobs in care taking is mostly covered by foreigners as well. With an aging population (baby boomers) the need for care taking personal is big at the moment and in the coming years.

If this initiative gets accepted the politicians and economists fear a stifling of the economy due to investors investing elsewhere and companies moving out of the country in order to benefit from a larger and better pool of workers.
