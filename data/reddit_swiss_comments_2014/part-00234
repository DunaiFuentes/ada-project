I'd do this if I were you (Or something similar.. not fleshed out):

1. Fly to Zurich, get a good Hotel in the city, enjoy the day and go to bed early.
2. Do stuff in Zurich.
3. Trip to Lucerne (1hr from Zurich). Enjoy the city for some time, then take one of the boats on the lake and do a trip to Pilatus or Interlaken or something. Get back to Zurich in the evening.
4. Train to Locarno, get hotel, enjoy city.
5. Hiking trip in valle maggia (Nice little trains that go back there from Locarno central station).
6. Go to Zermatt. Maybe check out Glacier Express or Bernina Express.
7. + 8. Maybe do a two day hiking trip (There are these huts all over the country where you can sleep for a small fee, called SAC)
9. Maybe visit something in Romandie.
10. Fly back.

If you like to do an express visit of the cities that seems about right.
Just group those cities by location and you are good to go.

If you want to hike or visit some less touristic areas you will need to reduce the number of cities since you would need more time to reach those areas.

Yes, restaurants are open in the weekends.
It depends much for the cities and the region on the cities, also what kind of restaurant.
Normally restaurants in the touristic parts, like the old part of those cities will be open.
If you want a cheap alternative, Migros and Coop (the supermarkets here) offer ready to eat foods like salads and sandwiches which are not that bad. (Bigger the Migros and Coop better the choices).

Cheaper restaurant will cost you about 15-20 CHF for a meal (coop and migros have restaurants too).
A decent restaurant will cost you about 30-40 CHF

Luzerne, you have the transport museum which is nice and huge.
Not far from Lucerne you have the Hammetschwand lift.

Zurich, i only visited the old city and did some shopping there, lots of choices there.

In the Valais region you have Gorge du Trient, Bisse de Savièse or Sanetsch if you are into a full day hiking. Also the Great Dixence (tallest dam in CH)

Tessin, you have the small and beautiful Locarno and not far you have the Versasca river and dam. And Lugano is a must visit too.

Fribourg has a really nice old city.
Not far from there you can visit Gruyère and Moléson (15min by car) for hiking.
You have the Creux du Van near Neuchatel which is really beautiful and offers a great hiking view.

In Geneva you have all the standard tourist points, like UN, lake Léman and the jet d'eau. You can take the boat from Geneva to Montreux.

If you are into airshows, the 30-31 August and 6-7 September is the comemoration of the 100th years of the Swiss Air Force in Payerne.

If you like kayaking, in some cities you can rent yourself one and go paddling. :)

You can drink in public

Another thing to take into consideration if you are coming to take photographs the warmer months have the longer sunlight, even heading into the night :)
