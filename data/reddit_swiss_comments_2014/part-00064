The guy never really bought this weapon and it was just assigned to him as it seems to be a military weapon. Probably that's been a few decades ago and who knows if he is still alive? 

You could contact one of those captains in the list in one of the comments here, but these are just names and you gotta figure out an email address or something. 
There is another possibility of contacting the Zeughaus in Uri for further information. I bet they have an email address and speak English. 

I'm not sure if you fully understand the purpose of a weapon you get during your military duty. You spend a couple weeks with it when you're around 18 and a like two weeks per year for a decade afterwards. Then your duty ends and you give the weapon back. There is a possibility to receive a weapon afterwards but these are normally other carbines. 

Swiss people/soldiers are usually not very fond of weapons and even less about storing them at home (which they normally have to) and they are glad to get rid of it.

&gt;**Puter** (also spelled **Putèr**;  puter (help·info)) is a variety of [Romansh](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romansh_language) spoken in the [Engadin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engadin) valley in [Graubünden](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graub%C3%BCnden), which is in the southeastern part of [Switzerland](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switzerland). It is spoken in the central northwestern end of the valley between [S-chanf](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S-chanf) and [St. Moritz](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Moritz), as well as in the region of the [Bernina Pass](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernina_Pass). Romansh was named by 5,497 people within the upper Engadine valley (30%) as a habitually spoken language in the census of 2000, which probably corresponds roughly to the total number of speakers.  The term is probably originally a nickname derived from put 'porridge', meaning 'porridge-eaters'.

&gt; What beer should I definitely try?

Quöllfrisch is, in my opinion at least, the best beer which is available nearly everywhere. Feldschlösschen is the most popular Swiss beer. There are  dozens of small regional breweries and hundreds of micro breweries scattered all over Switzerland. It's probably easier if you decide where to go first and then ask which beers from the places you visit are worth trying. Alternatively you could just depend on good luck and try a new beer in every bar you visit. The variety in taste is rather limited and there are no really bad beers. Except Eichhof which is nothing but watered down piss aged for the right amount of time. Stay away from Eichhof. Seriously. People from central Switzerland will tell you how amazing it is, but do yourself a favor and don't believe them. Eichhof is disgusting. Period.

First of all, about eating, it really depends on your budget, Switzerland is expensive. For $$$ I'd recommend the Restaurant Sein in Zurich, awesome, great food but you have to be open for new stuff. For $$ maybe the Restaurant Bindella in Zurich or the Restaurant Facincani in St. Gallen, both of which are excellent though the latter one stands out since the chef there is also boss, server and a great host in one. For $ only one really jumps to my mind, the St. Gallerhof in Zurich, great burgers, even for American standards, though I don't think you'd be interested in that. For a real Swiss experience, try the Zeughauskeller in Zurich, always full, but I've never been disappointed by the food.

Now for what to visit. Since you are already in Lucerne I recommend checking out the Swiss Museum of transportation, if that is of any interest to you, it has everything, from a great exhibit about the railway network and its creation with a lot of real trains in a hangar, over a history of inland navigation to an aviation exhibit, with a CV-990 Coronado outside. Also, if you manage to go to St. Gallen check out the Stiftsbibliothek, a library with some really old books, reaching back to about the 14th century, if my memory serves me right. Also the train ride from Luzern to St. Gallen is quite scenic, so that's a plus. If we're already talking about trains let this be told, you absolutely don't need a car, you can get by on public transportation very well. For timetables and fares check [this](http://www.sbb.ch/en/home.html). 
If you manage to get to St. Gallen you might also want to go to Säntis, a 2500m / 8200' mountain, great view, good restaurant(s), though pricy, you might want to look at the forecast before doing that, there might / will be snow on there. 

If you're into aviation or really if you have time on your hands, go to the visitor's deck at Zürich's Airport, a great experience for 5.--, and you can also get a guided tour for I believe 18.--, I have to check on that one though. 

One tourist spot to miss: Definitely Jungfraujoch, way overpriced and overcrowded IMO, not worth it. Otherwise, do whatever you like. 

Roads to drive: If already open, Lukmanier Summit, though slightly off any beaten track, a beautiful road. 

Beer, I can't really tell, I don't drink, but my colleagues either drink Schützengarten or the beforementionned Quöllfrisch.

Well, that was my two cents, any questions, shoot 'em, got nothing else to do, why not help a canadien?
