never heard that and it sounds kind of silly.

&gt; Is the 10 franc note with Euler on it still in circulation?

No, the current face on the 10 franc note is Charles Edouard Jeanneret, Le Corbusier (1887-1965).

But I have no idea how to get a note with Euler on it. Euler was on the seventh series of note, which according to the SNBs website was never released as it is only a reserve series.

In most cases, you can break your three-month notice period obligation by proposing a suitable tenant to take over the existing contract.  

They would need to submit their application documents (so the usual Betreibungsregisterauszug, application form, and any other documents required by the landlord/agency) and if the agency finds these in order, they can adopt your contract at any time (doesn't need to be the beginning of a month, or any usual moving date).

The agency can't refuse to accept a new tenant without reason (if they have the appropriate documents and are solvent); however, in my experience, it's best to propose more than one applicant especially if you're under time pressure.  A group viewing with a stack of application forms and the email address of the landlord is usually the easiest way.

I had luck posting the vacancy on the following sites:
Free:
* anibis.ch
* petits-annonces.ch
* gratisinserate.ch
* [Facebook ""Wohnungssuche in...""]
(https://www.facebook.com/wohnungenstgallen?fref=ts) 

Cost:
* homegate.ch
* immoscout24.ch

Also consider publicising it through the university if it's a property that would suit a student.  

Another option would be to sub-let your apartment.  This is also easily done: you need to inform the agency/landlord in writing and again they cannot refuse without reasons.  You usually cannot charge the sub-tenant more than a 10% increase on the rental price you pay.  This may be an easy way to get someone in and covering the rent, then you can give the usual notice period to the agency (and the sub-tenant can take over the lease).

I liked it a lot. It was fun and people were in good mood. The size of all of it is mind blowing. Security was omnipresent but they made it smart by dressing the policemen not in uniforms but in violet sport wear. I had to go through metal detectors only at the train station and in the olympic park. Some things were not perfect, like the new train that goes very slow or long lines that could be avoided but then again it's not Switzerland. 

One thing that really saddened me was the lack of foreigners. Our media really did a great job at ruining it for everyone. Maybe it was also just too far away for many but I don't think there were more than 5% non-Russians.

Otherwise I share most of the critics that have been made during the 2005 referendum on European Union constitution in France (mainly that it's an anti-democratic constitution), and so I'm a bit cautious toward the current EU. I think we should avoid to have laws that are ""floating around"" in weird treaties with the EU. The way the EU linked together different subjects is completely against the swiss way, there's an article in the swiss constitution about subject unity of referendums that people should re-read.
