The first two points of the Eligibility Conditions are:

- You need to be a national of a CERN Member State and studying in a Member State. Romanian and Serbian nationals are also eligible.
Students from Non-Member States are able to apply only if they have been residing in a Member State for the last 5 years and are enrolled in a Member State educational establishment.


- You have started or are about to start a doctoral programme at a CERN Member State university.

Your personal nationality/country of residence is important. Also, the university you attend is important.

If you pass the first rule, you should apply to a PhD programme at a university in a CERN Member State. If you do this, you have the possibility to study on the doctoral programme at CERN.

Any university in any Member State.

Agreeing with the right wing ideas is not as ""popular"" or ""easy"" as doing the same with left wing.
