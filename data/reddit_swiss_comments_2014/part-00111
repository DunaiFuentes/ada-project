true,onthewaytowonderland,zh,Zürich,"Art/Music/Design scene: International bands will visit Switzerland but prepare to pay a lot for their concerts and maybe travel to Berne, Zurich or Basel.
LGBT: I'm straight myself but there are gay clubs all around and especially if you stay in urban areas, this should not be a problem
Language: I'm not from the french speaking part, but I know that you don't need to speak German or Italian there. French is enough. (Or else English)
Religion: I'm sure there are mosques in the cities. Swiss people (like basically every country's people) are afraid of the unknown, so they might not start hugging you for being muslim. They won't stab you either. Just don't worry. Be nice to people and they will be nice to you. There are lots of immigrants and their children from all over the islamic world. Mostly, swiss people are very private about their religions.
Jobs: English will certainly help you, don't know about Arabic. Depends on your education i guess and previous experiences but basicall I have no idea how easy or difficult it is to find a job in that field
Animals: I guess you have to look for something in your neighborhood but I can't imagine it being too difficult to find a place to work for free

There are some things we Swiss do like:
a) be always on time. If you're invited to someone's house, be on time. Not even 15 minutes late. Or else you got to call
b) In French lessons you probably have already learnt the difference between Vous and Tu. Be careful which you use. You don't want to use You for people you know well (If they introduce themselves with their first name) but you don' want to use Tu with people you don't know
c) we swiss generally are not very outgoing with strangers. you don't start talking to someone on the streets that you don't know. If you meet someone and you are already with someone you know, you have to introduce the two to eachother.
