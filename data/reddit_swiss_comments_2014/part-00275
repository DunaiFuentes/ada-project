I looked at a few films and saw only german/english subtitles and audio, but I didn't go through exhaustively.

Not that many films, mostly serials. Selection is maybe 50 films, 50 series?

 For series it has ""big"" things like modern family, breaking bad, house of cards usw. but only one or two ""kind of local"" tv series (Stromberg), nothing else that was european (i would have maybe liked some of the better french stuff for example), almost no british series (only sherlock and downton abbey I think i think) which is very bad.

Still there were some things I wouldn't mind watching, so not a complete miss.

Films similarly mostly mainstream US stuff from 2 years ago, not a  huge selection, quite some disney films though.

All in all I hope that the selection will improve in the next few months as they sort out wider licensing agreements.

true,markus_b,vd,Vaud,"They should not focus only on Martigny.

All trains departing from Geneva airport stop at Geneva main station (1st stop). It is usual to take a train at the airport to go a Geneva downtown (main station) as this is the fastest way to get there.

Also, the train to Martigny would stop in many places along the way (Nyon, Morges, Lausanne, Vevey, Montreux, etc). In addition Martigny is not the last station, that train continues until Brig, much further up the valley.

Querying the train timetable is quite easy on http://www.sbb.ch",0,1411054793,null,0,false,0,cklup8n,t3_2gr013,t1_cklup8n,t3_2gr013,null,1426943625,9,false,Switzerland,t5_2qhp6,9

But now his page is down and the photos are no longer visible. So, no visit with the Friedensrichter, which is actually a bit too bad because I was in the mood to kick some ass! 
But then again, I am happy my image is no longer associated with this clown.
