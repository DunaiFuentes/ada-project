No crazy taxes, no crazy police raids or checkpoints, no politicians attempting to introduce crazy new laws (because they can't). When everything else is in order you can be left alone to produce nice things, things to be proud off. 

So, if you want something actionable, pay your employees reasonably but give them and their families lots of social benefits so they don't have to worry.
