The first thing you train with it is mostly handling/manipulations (because it's so heavy and most people can't hold it for very long in the beginning and they want to make sure you can load/unload and fix jams with your reflexes)

Then from time to time you shot at a 300 meter firing range where you will train hitting the standard 10 ring target and a black/green silhouette target (a pain to see clearly). All along the first few training sessions you will learn to adjust your sight.

In total you get 2 chances of earning an achievement in marksmanship (gets you a single decoration), not that hard if you are trying.

Second part is close range standing (30-10 meters) you train to react to standard situations where you just hold your rifle and at some point of the story you are supposed to shot your target or not:
Yelling, warning shot, center mass or blatter. depending on the situation (don't try to do headshots, they don't like that, although I always did it, if they as why, you just claim he had a suicide west, they love smartasses ;p).

Third part is some weird exercise including a group of four where you are supposed to fire small burst shots and cycle through your group while moving as a group in one direction. Careful, almost got hit by some stupid idiot in the back...

And lastly long range in the open, random popping targets at different distances and you are just supposed to hit them.
