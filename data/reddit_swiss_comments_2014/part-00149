2) You'll get used to Swiss-German, it's a bit different, but once you got hang of the differences you'll understand most of it.

3) Both should have at least average demand. Which means the jobs exist, but it will take a bit of research to get to the open positions.

4) I don't know... although after a certain time you can apply for the Swiss nationality.

5) That's up to you. You can live in the suburbs and commute by car, or live in the city and not have a car. Any other option might be a bit painful. It also depends on which city you'll be in, because in Zurich the public transportation is very good, and traffic jams are everywhere.

true,Kapensteijn,ag,Aargau,"1) Since Hungary is part of the EU, finding a job will be challenging as everywhere, but certainly not impossible. Doing you application completely through phone and internet is unlikely though, so probably you will have to plan a visit to Switzerland beforehand to do an interview. It is not completely impossible however, it just requires some back and forth sending of employment contracts.

2) Between the two of you, you and your girlfriend share the most commonly spoken languages in Switzerland. My experience as a non-native german speaking foreigner is, that when you speak a decent bit of high-german, in a couple months time you can at least comprehend a fair bit of Swiss German conversation. Of course this also depends on your level of involvement with the language. As you might know, almost every Swiss person in the German speaking part can speak, whether they like it or not, high german, so your B2 level should be good to start with.

3) According to their website, GE employs about 1200 people in Switzerland, so they're bound to have some jobs. Having worked previously for GE I reckon can only work in your advantage. Just look at their website under ""Offene Stellen"" to see if there is something that suits your background. I'm not very involved in the financial/bookkeeping business, but since Switzerland is basically the financial center of Europe, your girlfriend should be okay. Again, look for open positions on the websites of major companies.

4) In my region there are many foreign workers, especially from Eastern Europe. Although there are many that keep to themselves and don't assimillate or integrate very well, for you this can be a matter of personal choice. If you are open and outgoing you are very welcomed by the Swiss, they'll actually like very much that you want to be involved. Don't expect them to come to you however, the initiative lies with you. Coming from Hungary in any case, is not something that is frowned upon, as far as I can tell.

5) Whether it's worth to own a car very much depends on your location. In the bigger cities (Zürich, Geneva, etc.) it will be a hassle. You have to find parking spots and the roads around the cities are always congested. Using a car for your daily commute is generally more expensive than using public transport, which, as you already may know, is unparallelled in the world. For me personally, living outside a major city, having a car is something I wouldn't want to miss, since it gives me the opportunity to also go and visit nice and less reachable places in Switzerland.

true,[deleted],null,null,"Kaputt, two 't's, and yes, same meaning in German.  I did a bit of research, and ""Kaputt"" comes either from the French ""capoter"" (to turn on one's head, i.e. for a ship to capsize), or from the ""être capot"" / ""faire capot"" - card playing expressions that mean you didn't win a single hand --&gt; you went ""kaputt"".  This then evolved, probably around the 30 Years' War, into being destroyed by pillage or defeat, and from there into a more general expression of ""broken"".  Yiddish, as you know, as a mainly German/Hebrew/Polish/Russian pidgin.

All I can think of is that it's either derivative of ""Kaputze (DE) / Capot (FR)"" (hood), from the Latin ""caput"" (head).  From [this page](http://www.etymologie.info/~e/c_/ch-stoffe.html), loosely translated, ""capot"" / ""capotto"" (IT) mean the same as ""Kapuzenmantel"", or coat with a hood, which was abbreviated to Kaput / Kaputt (both spellings exist, which is extremely odd, given that we know SWISS GERMAN IS SUCH A WELL ORGANIZED AND CONSISTENT LANGUAGE WITH CLEAR PRONUNCIATION AND SPELLING RULES AMIRITE).  After coats stopped having built-in hoods, it became a generic term for military coats.
