That's quite a bold introduction, when all the author could come up with in 800+ years of history is less than a handful of examples, the most prominent one being ''Mère Royaume of Geneva, who is said to have hurled a pot of boiling soup onto troops''.

Another great illustration of this is the column titled ''Women in Swiss battles'', which literally doesn't contain a single line about a woman in a battle.

Seems to me like the author went the wrong way. She searched for evidence to confirm her initial idea, instead of searching for facts and then creating a storyline. The title+introduction+conclusion should be the last part of your work, not the first one.

I guess stuff like that happens when you force yourself to write something for ''international women's day'', but it has nothing to do with (quality) journalism. It looks like some 16y old wrote that for school.

This fiscal policy on residents abroad is held only by the US and Eritrea. Eritrea has been condemned by the UN for this practice because it sent consulate workers to eritrean immigrants to threaten them with consequences for their families if they don't pay the taxes. 
The US instead overloads them with paper and consultancy costs with the threat of ending up in prison if they don't comply and ever go back to their country. 
It's senseless violence for small money from people who emigrate, like if they're traitors or something. 

The US has very low taxes and treats the rich well, it has delaware so drug lords can keep their assets at home too, so this policy is also useless because the US doesn't have a meaningful number of people who emigrate for fiscal reasons who can be milked.
