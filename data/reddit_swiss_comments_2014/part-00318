For Japan you have to discount 90% of the country due to the same reason. What's your point? The population density in Switzerland is nowhere near problematic or even akin to ""a city"".

I'm not against securing oneself better by providing more resources by yourself. But it's a ridiculous idea that we can survive on our own, individually or as a country. The projected change in population will do little to change that, so do the measures of this initiative. But bringing up imports.. have you considered exports too? We rely heavily on a highly educated workforce and know-how which is not maintainable without the influx of well educated immigrants. By stifling this sector of the economy you found the best way to endanger our current high standard of living. Much more dangerous than a few more people using our top notch infrastructure.

I don't see our infrastructure as a problem. It's not like we're trying to keep it for ourselves.. wait, we're about to if we vote for this initiative. The technology that makes our infrastructure possible is the result of our liberal policies and developed know how, not isolationism and xenophobia.  
Also our infrastructure is a great role model for other nations that want to improve. And it provides jobs throughout the population being a great investment in the lower and middle class.

I sort of see your point now, though. Thank you for using the word **netto** as the only attempt at explanation. You tried as hard as you could, I assume. 

So your position is based on preposition that we hugely reduce inflow, the outflow will stay the same, people will die at the same rate or even faster, we'll keep 1.5 kids ratio, nobody in the outside world will even bother about this change and boom, switzerland will prosper and finally trains will be less crowded.

Actually, out of curiosity, instead of trying to make this a law, I would offer an experiment to the country. Apply this idea for 5 years and see what happens. Switzerland is rich anyway and will be able to recover from this financially. In addition it will get way poorer than now and consequently less attractive to scary immigrants. Double win. And finance a war in africa and china, so that earth population will get reduced. But bloody asylum rules... Anyway wars are there anyway, there are other countries interested in them.

Honestly, though. Norway introduced tax exemption to tesla and electric cars are the most popular there. Why not switzerland?
