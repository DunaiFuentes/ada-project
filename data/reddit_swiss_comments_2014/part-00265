Here are some numbers from it:

* Less than one month's waiting to see a specialist: 82% of patients
* Less than one month's waiting time for elective surgery: 55%
* More than two months' waiting time to see a specialist: 5%
* More than two months' waiting time for elective surgery: 7%

Compare to [the British NHS:](http://www.nhs.uk/choiceintheNHS/Rightsandpledges/Waitingtimes/Pages/Guide%20to%20waiting%20times.aspx)

&gt; You have the legal right to start your NHS consultant-led treatment within a maximum of 18 weeks from referral, unless you choose to wait longer or it is clinically appropriate that you wait longer.
