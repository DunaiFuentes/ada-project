Go to coop city across the main train station at 3 pm on Saturday. They'll discount a lot of the perishables with 50% stickers. Buy whatever is on sale any given week. It's pretty much a duopoly so Migros &amp; Coop never offer the same deals at the same time.

Vapiano's is pretty pricy for what you get, but they hand out vouchers once in a while for ""buy one pizza, get one free"" deals. Cafe du Poan is pretty good - it's a ""local"" restaurant that offers steak and fondue.

*Splurge*... you can go to Trois Tours (Michelin restaurant), Zum Schild, Au Sauvage, or Hotel de Ville (my fav).

Buy a monthly bus pass for Fribourg. The bus system is pretty good. Consider getting a Demi-Tarif card from the SBB if you're looking to travel. It'll pay for itself pretty quickly.

**Walking** Fribourg is nice : if you want to go for a small walk you have many walking opportunities : just go down in the old town and you have the Gotheron valley, really nice, or just goes up the Sarine to the dam and take the sentier Ritter wich will bring you back to Pérolles (but both might be closed during the winter, the rocks here tend to be unstable).

What yesat said. I love Le Mondial. Cafe Populaire is ok but always full and if you're over 25 you won't fit in. Also, if you're looking for a cheap lunch (menus around 7.50 CHF), check out the university cantines. There are a few to choose from. I like the one on Perolles best.

* There seems to be always something going on on Place du Georg Python.

* Venture out in the surrounding areas. Assuming you don't have a car, everything is accessible by train. Come &amp; visit lovely Bern. Visit Gruyere to see how they make cheese.

You'll end up paying by minute.  Do they need to call Swiss phones a lot or internationally?

Orange world prepaid is pretty decent. CHF 20/mo for 1gb of data, and theres a CHF 50 bonus if you load with CHF 100.

true,ughthat,ar,Appenzell Ausserrhoden,"It should be fairly easy as long as you know all the details. What you are looking for is an ""international wire transfer."" In my experience (mostly with US Bank and BofA) the cost for sending money from the US to Switzerland is around 30-40 USD per transfer. Incoming wires in Switzerland should be free. Sending money from Switzerland to the US will cost you about 20 CHF on the Swiss side and another $10 USD on the US side. You should be able to just call your bank and ask them about the fees.

In my experience most banks require you to be go to a branch to initiate an international wire. You may also ask your bank if there are any alternatives so you can send money to Switzerland while you are in Switzerland. Alternatively you could add your parents or someone you trust to your account in the US and ask them to initiate wires for you.

Another potential pitfall with US wires is that the US does not use the IBAN system (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Bank_Account_Number) while  that is the dominant system in Switzerland. This is mostly an issue when you transfer from Switzerland to the US, but if you are not careful your money will be held in the US before it bounces back to Switzerland a week or so later (and you will still be liable for the transfer fees). Again you can just call your US bank and ask them for the appropriate routing numbers to wire money from Europe to the US.

Keep in mind that the US has certain FinCEN and IRS rules that may require reporting of transfers over $10,000. I am not sure how exactly this works, but it's something to keep in mind. I think your US bank may do the reporting automatically, but you may just want to ask them if there is anything special you need to do for large transfers.

Overall I would suggest making as few transfers as possible to keep your costs down. If you are making frequent trips bank and forth also keep in mind that you are allowed to carry up to $10,000 in cash with you without having to report it. However personally I would only do this coming from the US to Switzerland. I've heard some horror stories of people getting their cash seized by customs when entering the US, and most US banks will get suspicious if you try to deposit $10k in cash. You won't have either of those worries in Switzerland.",0,1388730273,null,0,false,0,ceg4pux,t3_1u8ovy,t1_ceg4pux,t1_cefsnhn,null,1431778109,2,false,Switzerland,t5_2qhp6,2
