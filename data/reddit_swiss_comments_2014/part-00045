Europe has no real boss, what it will do is unpredictable. Every possible opinion is represented in Brussels and we don't know which one will prevail. Some are calling for Switzerland to be used as an example for what can happen to you when you leave Europe.

Blocher says our tunnels are a big argument in negotiations, but according to the nzz this does not weigh much. He seems as clueless as everyone else. The only arguments in our favor is that the other treaties are mutually beneficial, but how far will this take us? It seems obvious that we bring much less to Europe than Europe brings to us. 

The negotiations about taxes we had in the last years only led us to abandon our sacred cow, the banking secret, without gaining anything in return.

You're welcome, I just tried to answer the questions of P1r4nha ;-) [Here is another one that is very interesting](http://www.watson.ch/!303748413) 

&gt; I don't remember anyone talking about the numbers, numbers don't mean anything.

Don't get me wrong, the quotes I gave were not mine. They came out of a discussion. I just had a look at the vote information of the [Bilateralen-I](http://www.bk.admin.ch/themen/pore/va/20000521/index.html?lang=de&amp;download=NHzLpZeg7t,lnp6I0NTU042l2Z6ln1acy4Zn4Z2qZpnO2Yuq2Z6gpJCFeoR7e2ym162epYbg2c_JjKbNoKSn6A--), there are no numbers mentioned - generally very few information is given compared to today's vote.

&gt; I have a hard time imagining the difference between 10'000 europeans and 80'000 europeans.

This pretty much depends where you live in Switzerland. Take Glarus for example, a lovely canton, but almost none of the EU migrants moved there in comparison to Zurich, Zug, Geneva or Berne. I know young families which wanted to buy a home in the canton of Zurich, the region they grew up, and they couldn't afford it. Want to look how stupid the prices are? Have a look at the region Bauma. It's not close to Zurich, hasn't the best public transport connection, but you pay already a lot if you want to buy a home. I just think, there would have been other ways than the initiative, like I said in another post.

&gt; Apparently the Tagi article is a reprint from the Basler Zeitung, which more or less belongs to Blocher and friends. .... Seen in this light the article is a very effective propaganda that turns more or less unnoticed things from the past into something that makes you mad today. 

Those are dangerous words. First of all, you are right by the implication that Blocher may have some influence in the newspaper. But you are wrong when you think that the TA would reprint something if that is completely wrong. This article is published in TA, which far away from Blocher's point of view. Which means, your argument is either very weak and to simplistic or the TA is a newly right-winged newspaper.

&gt; Blocher is becoming a swiss Berlusconi, a sad protestant Berlusconi without prostitutes. 

As a half Italian, I had to laugh about this one. Could please express your idea?

&gt; I also remember a report about his growing influence in the NZZ.

I would love to read that, any source?

&gt; The feeling the swiss government betrays its people is something completely new to me, that sounds like american politics.

Now I feel like you are a politician ;-) Is it really new to you? There is something called classe politique (also an SRF shown), which basically mans that politicians are far from the people, in an own class. I will name a few people initiative that caused bad feelings for the people (again, I give information and **NOT** represent my own view!)

* Minderinitiative (was heavily delayed prior vote)
* Verwahrungsinitiative (actually not active in the words of the initiative)
* Zweitwohungsinitiative (seems like they look for a way around it, with many exceptions. again not as the initiative wanted)
* Minarettinitiative (never needed a vote, there were parts in active law that would have forbidden a Minarett in the center of a small village...generally a good initiative to see how stupid it is ignoring or turning down the people's fears)
* Ausschaffungsinitative (again delayed. If the SVP starts its Durchsetzungsinitiative, we're going to have a bad time. In case they win that one, they could win a lot of votes for the next election)
* Nicht-Raucher Schutz (Kt. ZH, too many variants possible)

I gave you some points in the brackets that express my idea why the SVP is able to make votes throughout the country. We can draw it down to the ignorance and arrogance of their opponents.

&gt; I am surprised that the contract should be renegotiable. 

Well, after the past four to six years that all politics ever said it isn't, that's not very surprising right?

&gt; I was surprised to hear on sunday this was an option, and no newspaper seems to believe it now.

Where did you hear that on Sunday? The politics ever said they want a NEW contract, not making any revision to the existing one. That's a difference! I have not seen any news paper actually taking up on that Article.

&gt; Brussels doesn't seem to know anything about it either, so I suppose this article 18 must be read together with other articles to get the full picture. 

Again not surprising me. The politicians now in EU active were not part of the EU executive while Switzerland and EU negotiated. I don't expect them to know the contracts when giving a statement, but i expect it from a Swiss politician (or at least mention the possibility of something unforeseeable that could be in the contract).
You are right in the point that it must be read with other articles. Nevertheless, there is a difference between the words: ""There is absolute NO room for revesion"" and ""We have to take a closer look if the contract leaves any room for a revision"". Did you spot the difference? The first one is interesting, it brings you on top of the news, publicity and you demonstrate strength for your own voters. The second one is probably the right thing to say, but news papers won't print it unless everyone answers in that way - which they don't as politicians on that level are kinda fame-whores (sorry for that word).

&gt; Law is so boring.

You're going to have a bad time in your hopefully long life. Law is no science, true; Law has no fixed boundaries, true; But if you say law is boring, I assume you don't get in touch with your rights, and duties.

true,zupatol,ge,Genève,"Thanks for the thoughtful response. After writing my post I actually realized I got some things wrong. The Tagi article was a surprise because it really looked like something I should be mad about. Reading it a second time I started to suspect this was deliberately written to enrage. There are things in there that I did already know, but its impossible for me to say if I heard of them before or after the vote, or its implementation. What I do remember is that this is the first time I saw these facts presented as evidence for some kind of lie.

I've been too harsh on the Tagi, which I actually stopped reading a while ago. I went back to it and it's much more nuanced than just this one article. Still the fact that they reprint an article from a newspaper in the Blocher nebula is strange, especially as it is on a national topic they should be very well capable of treating by themselves. It could hint at financial problems which would be a way for Blocher to influence them. The comparison of Blocher to Berlusconi is not from me. Much of Berlusconi's power comes from controlling half of Italy's television channels, and Blocher is obviously trying to spread his influence by buying up newspapers like the Basler Zeitung through friends. It's not clear if he has financial links to the Weltwoche, but if you look at the content it's obvious that some rich people have turned a formerly leftish paper to something that regularly brings hatemongering headlines about problems they almost make up. Unfortunately I can't find the article about Blochers influence in the NZZ. Googling ""svp nzz"" obviously brings up too much unrelated stuff. I think I read this in le Temps. One of the things it mentioned is a strange rule in the direction of the nzz that states any director (I forget the exact title) must belong to the FDP. They were on the way to relaxing this rule to also allow SVP. Blocher's eagerness to buy media influence resembles Berlusconi slightly, but I don't think he'll ever do something illegal or any of the other funny stuff, except maybe singing on television.

You are right that the talk about the classe politique is not new, but this is more about politicians being out of touch with people. They didn't see people would vote against minarets, so it does look like they don't understand their voters. But I don't see them actively betraying people by building minarets behind their back, which is more or less how that Tagi article sounds. I wasn't aware that anyone thought of our politicians that way. I see what you mean with the delays, and of course the SVP rethoric would cultivate feelings of betrayal in their followers. They sound so much like angry spoiled children that somehow I failed to realize someone would actually listen.

Not reading the law can be dangerous, but in public matters you can usually rely on law professors to tell you how things stand. In this case it seems pretty clear that the treaties don't allow themselves to be renegotiated easily. I don't think the particular wording here changes the situation very much. Any contract can be changed if all the parties agree. Those who say revision is impossible probably mean we can't change the treaty by ourselves, and that getting Europe's agreement is about as hard as negotiating a new treaty from scratch.

I mostly don't read the law texts in the brochure and trust the explanations, unless the text is short. I agree this is possibly a bad idea, but I didn't have any bad surprises yet, and I keep my fingers crossed :). I think the hard part is guessing how it will affect the country, not understanding what it's about.$

I disagree on some parts of the paragraph, where the next sentence appears.

&gt; I see what you mean with the delays, and of course the SVP rethoric would cultivate feelings of betrayal in their followers. 

I do agree, that rethoric is kind of the gun powder to mad feelings especially the feeling of betrayal. However, don't make that mistake to simply name it the SVP rethoric. And certainly don't think that the 50.3% voters are SVP voters. That party is not as strong as (especially foreign) media makes them look like. Over the next few weeks, take a step back when you read an article, listen to an argument on radio or TV. Take a look at the rethoric of the lefts as well. We have already seen a firework of rethoric in the responses to last Sunday's vote (example: ""All six non-SVP Federal Council should resign, Blocher should now take over and negotiate with Brussel"" needless to say what went through my mind...). I'm also aware, that delaying a dossier is also done in favor of the party (sometimes the parties do not act on the solution but politics, that's what brings them voters...unfortunately). 

&gt; They sound so much like angry spoiled children that somehow I failed to realize someone would actually listen.

Well right now both sides do. Again, I don't like when people point finger at others while they do the same (and yes, left and right are doing this, I know). This reminds me on mathematics; Are you familiar with the theory of infinity? That is is a loop, positive-infinity will result in negative-infinity and vice-versa (not sure if correctly explained in English ;-)). Politics is the same, obviously not in the positions. But, if you go far enough left and far enough right, you end up at the same position, the same behavior, the same short sighted type of persons. The past ten years, I have the feeling that this had happened to both SP and SVP. Both act like spoiled brats, are intolerant as hell and lost ability to actually discuss as they have to remain on their own spot - in the name of the voters or whatever.

&gt; I mostly don't read the law texts in the brochure and trust the explanations, unless the text is short. I agree this is possibly a bad idea, but I didn't have any bad surprises yet, and I keep my fingers crossed :). I think the hard part is guessing how it will affect the country, not understanding what it's about.

First, at least you are reading something and what I read at the beginning, you read different newspapers, so you can expect to be broadly informed about a topic. However, depending on what newspapers you read, you might just get one side of story. This is why I started to read the law texts if I vote on something. The second reason, that one basically came over the last year as a confirmation of the first one, I have challanged some of the biggest Swiss newspapers on the quality when they write about statistics and background information. And I found shocking mistakes, printed on paper, believed by people. To cite Kant:""Habe Mut, dich deines eigenen Verstandes zu bedienen."" A soon to be lost ability by mankind...

In the other countries people never chose to be in that country, kings and empires decided it, and so when they feel they're being slighted (by politicians, not even a popular vote by everybody) they want independence, and then the others look at them like a bunch of traitors or something.
