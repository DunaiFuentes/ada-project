&gt;The **Chapel Bridge** (German: **Kapellbrücke**) is a covered wooden footbridge spanning diagonally across the Reuss River in the city of Lucerne in central Switzerland. Named after the nearby St. Peter's Chapel, the bridge is unique since it contains a number of interior paintings dating back to the 17th century, although many of them were destroyed along with most of the centuries old bridge in a 1993 fire. Subsequently restored, the Kapellbrücke is the oldest wooden covered bridge in Europe, as well as the world's oldest surviving truss bridge. It serves as the city's symbol and as one of Switzerland's main tourist attractions.

I work on CloudFlare's support team. None of your (read: Cablecom's) traffic is being routed through Australia. Here's the explanation:

CloudFlare uses Anycast to broadcast our IP address space (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anycast). This means that all of CloudFlare's IP address space is available in each of our datacenters simultaneously. Therefore, requests to CloudFlare IPs are routed to the topographically nearest datacenter. You're able to see this a bit more clearly by visiting http://traceroute.monitis.com/index.jsp?url=103.31.6.33&amp;testId=288214 where clicking the different regions (US, Europe, Asia/Pacific) and seeing that all the requests resolve to different locations.

It is true that the CloudFlare IP address space that is assigned to imgur is registered in Australia, but that in no way necessitates or implicates that traffic is routed through that country, merely that the IP address is registered there.

Some of the posts in this and the other thread have attached traceroutes to i.imgur.com from your current locations. Almost all of these traceroutes are routed through our datacenter in Paris, France like the comment here: http://www.reddit.com/r/Switzerland/comments/1vdkby/imgur_and_upccablecom/cerwtce where prs-b8-link.telia.net is Telia's connection point in **P**a**R**i**S**. 

I would advise against hard coding an IP for i.imgur.com in your hosts file, as recommended as a workaround by another redditor. I advise against this in the event that the IP addresses for i.imgur.com change, in which case, you'd be unable to access the domain at all until the entry in your hosts file was removed. 

Beginning yesterday, we had seen some congestion on upstream networks in Paris (https://twitter.com/CloudFlareSys/status/423903478872698880) which resulted in slowness to all domains using CloudFlare that were accessed through Paris. This congestion should now be clear.

The best avenue for CloudFlare support for future issues is by submitting a ticket via https://support.cloudflare.com/ . I would also encourage checking our knowledge base there for any solutions prior to submitting a ticket. For example, when reporting slowness, including the information requested in the article here https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/en-us/articles/200172856-My-website-is-slow-or-having-performance-issues- helps us determine any potential causes more quickly.",0,1389987995,null,0,false,0,ces4ic5,t3_1vdkby,t1_ces4ic5,t1_cerugju,null,1431987120,1,false,Switzerland,t5_2qhp6,1

&gt;

&gt;An **Internet exchange point** (**IX** or **IXP**) is a physical infrastructure through which Internet service providers (ISPs) exchange Internet traffic between their networks (autonomous systems).

&gt;IXPs reduce the portion of an ISP's traffic which must be delivered via their upstream transit providers, thereby reducing the average per-bit delivery cost of their service. Furthermore, the increased number of paths learned through the IXP improves routing efficiency and fault-tolerance.

Alternatively I'd also accept a new way - other than evidence - to discern that which is more likely true than false if said method is sound. (They have not done that, but maybe you have an idea here)

This leaves me with no alternative (since they don't qualify as basic beliefs either) than to put their claims in the possible-explanations-lacking-support-camp (somewhere together with Russell's teapot) which is the set of ideas where I stick with the null hypothesis (=not accepting them as true).

Second: You can't really start in the 2nd/3rd year of a program directly, there's not really a notion of ""years"" in most universities as there is in, say, high school. You just need to get a certain number of credits to graduate. You can probably transfer your current credits though to get a head start. Your best bet is probably to ask your school about how that works and where credits can be transferred to. Most universities will probably not give you full credit though... your milage may vary. I highly doubt you'll be able to graduate _more_ quickly by changing universities. Usually that ends up being an impediment rather than an advantage.",0,1390017643,null,0,false,0,cesgs8z,t3_1vh3jy,t1_cesgs8z,t3_1vh3jy,null,1431992999,9,false,Switzerland,t5_2qhp6,9
