Getting there: The hiking trails usually start in places who have public transport. You don't drive to the trail, you take the rain or bus there. This has the additional advantage that you can hike one way as you don't have to come back to fetch a car.

One remark: Many cabins are only open in summer. Others are open all year around, but only have services (food, etc.) in summer. You can still go there, but need to bring your own food.

Der Bundesrat wird beauftragt, die Benachteiligung der Schweizer Sicherheits- und Wehrtechnikindustrie im Vergleich mit der internationalen Konkurrenz durch Änderung von Artikel 5 Absatz 2 der Kriegsmaterialverordnung (KMV) wie folgt zu beseitigen:

a. Das Bestimmungsland widerrechtlich an einem internationalen bewaffneten Konflikt beteiligt ist oder im Bestimmungsland ein interner bewaffneter Konflikt vorherrscht;

b. Im Bestimmungsland ein hohes Risiko besteht, dass das auszuführende Kriegsmaterial für die Begehung von schwerwiegenden Menschenrechtsverletzungen eingesetzt wird;

c. Die Beschaffung des auszuführenden Kriegsmaterials die sozioökonomische Entwicklung des Bestimmungslands massgeblich beeinträchtigen könnte;

d. Im Bestimmungsland ein hohes Risiko besteht, dass das auszuführende Kriegsmaterial unter Verletzung des humanitären Völkerrechts oder der Menschenrechte gegen die Zivilbevölkerung eingesetzt wird;

e. Unverändert.

Eine Minderheit (Savary, Hêche, Zanetti) beantragt, die Motion abzulehnen.
Begründung

Im Bericht in Erfüllung des Postulates Frick 10.3622 vom 18. Juni 2010 stellt der Bundesrat eine Benachteiligung der Schweizer Sicherheits- und Wehrtechnikindustrie gegenüber der europäischen Konkurrenz fest. Die Benachteiligung betrifft sowohl die Gesetzgebung, namentlich die restriktivere Formulierung von Bewilligungskriterien, als auch die Bewilligungspraxis für Rüstungsexporte. Der Bundesrat stellt insbesondere auch eine Benachteiligung gegenüber Staaten wie Österreich und Schweden fest, welche ähnliche völkerrechtliche und aussenpolitische Rahmenbedingungen wie die Schweiz aufweisen. Gegenüber weiteren EU-Staaten wie Deutschland, Italien, Frankreich, Belgien und den Niederlanden sind die Differenzen noch grösser.

Der Bundesrat zeigt in seinem Bericht ferner auf, dass eine Verbesserung der Rahmenbedingungen für die schweizerische Rüstungsindustrie sinnvollerweise nur über eine Anpassung der Bewilligungskriterien in der Kriegsmaterialverordnung erreicht werden könnte.

Schliesslich nennt der Bundesrat in seinem Bericht auch Konsequenzen der restriktiven Gesetzgebung und Bewilligungspraxis: Sie könne ""zu einem Auftragsrückgang für die schweizerische Rüstungsindustrie führen, was mit einer Reduktion ihrer Kapazitäten einhergehen dürfte. Dabei gehen der Schweiz schwierig (wieder) zu erlangendes Fachwissen, Forschungsmöglichkeiten, Arbeitsplätze und schliesslich auch ein Teil der verteidigungsrelevanten industriellen Kapazität verloren."" Dieser Prozess hat bereits eingesetzt. Die drei grössten Wehrtechnik-Unternehmen mussten dieses Jahr Entlassungen bekanntgeben: General Dynamics European Land Systems - Mowag streicht 270 Stellen in Kreuzlingen, Ruag rund 65 in Thun, Rheinmetall Air Defence 80 in Zürich.

Nur durch eine Änderung der zwingenden Ausschlusskriterien gemäss Artikel 5 Absatz 2 KMV erhält der Bundesrat den Handlungsspielraum zurück, um jedes Ausfuhrgeschäft anhand der Bewilligungskriterien von Artikel 5 Absatz 1 KMV fallweise zu beurteilen, wie dies bis Ende 2008 der Fall war. Eine gesamtheitliche Beurteilung muss neben den aussenpolitischen Grundsätzen und internationalen Verpflichtungen der Schweiz auch wirtschaftliche und sicherheitspolitische Erwägungen umfassen (Zweckartikel des Kriegsmaterialgesetzes). Nicht zuletzt liegt eine Einzelfallbeurteilung auf der Linie des Entwurfes für einen Uno-Waffenhandelsvertrag. Gemäss vorgeschlagenem Kriterienkatalog zur Bewilligung von Ausfuhrgesuchen soll in jedem Einzelfall eine Risikoanalyse vorgenommen werden, welche die Art des auszuführenden Guts sowie das Risiko einer unrechtmässigen Verwendung gewichtet.
Stellungnahme des Bundesrates vom 04.09.2013

In seinem Bericht in Erfüllung des Postulates Frick 10.3622 hat der Bundesrat gewisse Unterschiede in der schweizerischen Gesetzgebung und in der Folge eine restriktivere Bewilligungspraxis für Rüstungsausfuhren gegenüber gewissen Bestimmungsländern im Vergleich zu europäischen Staaten wie Österreich, Schweden, Frankreich, Deutschland und Italien ausgewiesen.

Der Bundesrat hat sich im Bericht vorbehalten, die für die schweizerische Sicherheitsindustrie nachteilige Situation neu zu beurteilen, sofern sich Anzeichen ergeben sollten, dass aufgrund der wirtschaftlichen Entwicklung (Konjunktur und Arbeitsmarkt) in der Schweiz der Gesetzesauftrag einer Aufrechterhaltung der landesverteidigungsrelevanten industriellen Kapazität, wie in Artikel 1 des Kriegsmaterialgesetzes verankert, gefährdet sein könnte.

In der Zwischenzeit mehren sich die Hinweise, dass sich die wirtschaftliche Situation für die Schweizer Sicherheits- und Wehrtechnikindustrie zunehmend verschlechtert. Zu erkennen ist dies beispielsweise anhand der bereinigten Ausfuhrstatistik für Kriegsmaterial, aber auch beim Rückgang neu bewilligter Geschäfte.

Aus diesem Grund unterstützt der Bundesrat das Anliegen der Motion, die Rahmenbedingungen für die Schweizer Sicherheitsindustrie zu verbessern. Er ist allerdings überzeugt, dass diese Verbesserung mit einer geringeren Anpassung der Kriegsmaterialverordnung erreicht werden kann, als dies die Motion vorsieht. Bei der konkreten Ausgestaltung einer Anpassung ist darauf zu achten, dass damit keine Preisgabe des Menschenrechtsschutzes und der humanitären Tradition der Schweiz einhergeht. Auf dieser Grundlage beantragt der Bundesrat Annahme der Motion.

true,Staross,null,null,"Irving Fisher's 100% Money, written in 1935, fells strangely contemporary:


&gt;Advantages 
 
&gt;The resulting advantages to the public would include the following: 
 
&gt;1. There would be practically no more runs on commercial banks;
because 100% of the depositors' money would always be in the bank (or 
available) awaiting their orders. In practice, less money would be withdrawn 
than now; we all know of the frightened depositor who shouted to the bank 
teller, ""If you haven't got my money, I want it; if you have, I don't."" 
 
&gt;2. There would be far fewer bank failures; 
because the important creditors of a commercial bank who would be most 
likely to make it fail are its depositors, and these depositors would be 100% 
provided for. 
 
&gt;3. The interest-bearing Government debt would be substantially reduced; 
because a great part of the outstanding bonds of the Government would be taken 
over from the banks by the Currency Commission (representing the 
Government). 
 
&gt;4. Our Monetary System would be simplified; 
because there would be no longer any essential difference between pocket-
book money and check-book money. All of our circulating medium, one 
hundred per cent of it, would be actual money. 
 
&gt;5. Banking would be simplified; 
at present, there is a confusion of ownership. When money is deposited in a 
checking account, the depositor still thinks of that money as his, though legally 
it is the bank's. The depositor owns no money in the bank; he is merely a 
creditor of the bank as a private corporation. Most of the ""mystery"" of banking 
would disappear as soon as a bank was no longer allowed to lend out money 
deposited by its customers, while, at the same time, these depositors were using 
that money as their money by drawing checks against it. ""Mr. Dooley,"" the Will 
Rogers of his day, brought out the absurdity of this double use of money on 
demand deposit when he called a banker ""a man who takes care of your money 
by lending it out to his friends."" 
In the future there would be a sharp distinction between checking deposits and 
savings deposits. Money put into a checking account would belong to the 
depositor, like any other safety deposit and would bear no interest. Money put 
into a savings account would have the same status as it has now. It would belong 
unequivocally to the bank. In exchange for this money the bank would give the 
right to repayment with interest, but no checking privilege. The savings 
depositor has simply bought an investment like an interest-bearing bond, and 
this investment would not require 100% cash behind it, any more than any other 
investment such as a bond or share of stock. 
The reserve requirements for savings deposits need not necessarily be 
affected by the new system for checking deposits (although a strengthening of 
these requirements is desirable). 
 
&gt;6. Great inflations and deflations would be eliminated; 
because banks would be deprived of their present power virtually to mint 
checkbook money and to destroy it; that is, making loans would not inflate our 
circulating medium and calling loans would not deflate it. The volume of the 
checking deposits would not be affected any more than when any other sort of 
loans increased or decreased. These deposits would be part of the total actual 
money of the nation, and this total could not be affected by being lent from one 
person to another. 
Even if depositors should withdraw all deposits at once, or should pay all 
their loans at once, or should default on all of them at once, the nation's volume 
of money would not be affected thereby. It would merely be redistributed. Its 
total would be controlled by its sole issuer—the Currency Commission (which 
could also be given powers to deal with hoarding and velocity, if desired). 
 
&gt;7. Booms and depressions would be greatly mitigated; 
because these are largely due to inflation and deflation. 
 
&gt;8. Banker-management of industry would almost cease; 
because only in depressions can industries in general fall into the hands of 
bankers. ",0,1394134798,null,0,false,0,cfw2gmg,t3_1ziork,t1_cfw2gmg,t1_cfu2hxt,null,1432687025,2,false,Switzerland,t5_2qhp6,2
