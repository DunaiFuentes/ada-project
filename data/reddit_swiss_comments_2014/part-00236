I did not find any data to confirm your claim and I am pretty sure it's not true. But I am going to assume that you mean the city of Zurich, where I can imagine that it might be true. The reason rents are high is because it's an attractive place to live and work in and there is a limited amount of space to do those things in. Unregulated, the living space in Zurich would be way more expensive and a lot of people could not afford to live in the city anymore... This would be worse than the present situation, in my opinion at least.

&gt; The Cato Institute is an American libertarian think tank headquartered in Washington, D.C. It was founded as the Charles Koch Foundation in 1974 by Ed Crane, Murray Rothbard, and Charles Koch, chairman of the board and chief executive officer of the conglomerate Koch Industries. In July 1976, the name was changed to the Cato Institute.

&gt; Occupation 	Chairman and CEO of Koch Industries

&gt; Net worth 	Increase US$ 41.6 billion (July 2014)

&gt; Products 	Asphalt, chemicals, commodities trading, energy, fibers, fertilizers, finance, minerals, natural gas, plastics, petroleum, pulp and paper, ranching

&gt; Bloomberg reports that from 1999 to 2003, Koch Industries was assessed ""more than $400 million in fines, penalties and judgments."" Daniel Indiviglio, in a reaction piece appearing in The Atlantic argues that the Bloomberg article is biased and misleading, asserting that the Bloomberg team ""only found eight instances of alleged misconduct by a giant multinational over the span of 63 years"".
&gt;
&gt; In 2000, for its 300 reported oil spills which had taken place across six states, Koch paid the largest civil fine ever imposed on a company under any federal environmental law for the illegal discharge of crude oil and petroleum products. In a settlement with the U.S. Justice Department and the state of Texas, the company agreed to pay a ""$30 million civil penalty, improve its leak-prevention programs and spend $5 million on environmental projects.""
