Shops doing this are in breach of contract to their card services provider.  
Upon installation, they agreed to accept the cards for any amount. 

Now, in 2002,the Wettbewerbskommission ruled that they can roll the commission over to the customer, if they visibly declare it at the point of sale.  
(for example, digitec does this with credit cards, because those commissions are a percentage of the amount)  
Debit cards (maestro) come with a fixed rate (usually ~0.20-0.30) which most shops don't worry about but may charge you for.

Tl;dr:  
You may insist on paying with card, but be prepared to hear shit for it and pay a tiny amount more, if there's a sign.
