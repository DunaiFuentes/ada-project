I'm born and raised in Wetzikon (moved to Zurich later in life). And I have to stress the fact that it is nor better nor worse than other towns in Switzerland (Yes, it is a town). It has already been said that it takes a while to integrate which is unpleasant but completely usual business. And, as in any other village/town people know each other within the different social groups and tend to talk behind ones back. But, frankly, it is quite easy to ignore that, as you will find your own group. 

Other than that I can say that I really loved growing up there: It's a very lovely town with a nice lake within a 20 minutes walk by foot (or 10 minutes by bicycle) - It's very nice to spend your time there during summer. In general, you are surrounded by nice hills and nature. So if you are a fan of it: great! Public transportation is very well developed (16 Minutes by train to Zurich, 20 minutes to Rapperswil). 

Within the last 20 years there has also been some development regarding shopping opportunities as well as bars/pubs. But don't be confused by that fact: It is still a very sleepy town. :) 

So please: Don't be scared, just be yourself, and  welcome to my hometown!

That said, Swiss people can be very candid (some might call it rude) when it comes to their opinions on foreigners. Especially when they don't speak German. I found that being offended or trying to be defensive won't help much. Instead they'll appreciate your honest opinion even if it differs from theirs. There is nothing PC about it and rural discussions can become loud and a bit confrontational. Not dangerous though.

I'm sure I'd never get into a real fight with any Swiss person in the way I just described, but I'm not sure you would be able to tell the difference between a rude comment or a threat, if only because of the language barrier.

I hope I was able to put the issue in perspective for you. There is nothing to feel scared about if you try to integrate slowly and softly. It's possible however that it's not that easy to find like-minded people among your direct neighbors. Zürich which isn't far away, is probably more welcoming in that regard.
