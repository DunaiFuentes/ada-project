Low bond rates and a relative low GDP/debt shows that the nation haven't paid costly for this at all. 

A minimum 20% gold might leave the central bank with fewer tools to ""defend"" CHF in a new crisis, it would also be even more attractive as a safe bet with hard backing. Printing CHF and selling for some other currency would then have the extra cost of buying gold who also might be soaring. 

I like the idea of backing the currency and strengthening the exchange reserve with gold. But mostly for a nation with a weak currency that would loose value in troubled times and for nations with large debts in foreign currency (like Ukraine or Hungary). 
For Switzerland I’m not sure. There ought to be better thing to buy than gold if you want to reduce the size of the reserve.

false,kitsune,null,null,"There are countless of studies about this, from a variety of countries, and the sentiment that 'sentencing is too lenient' turns out to be outright bullshit. Members of the public who think that judges are 'too lenient' turn out to be *as lenient* or even *more lenient* than the judges once they have the same information about a case.

For instance:

http://publicaddress.net/hardnews/perception-and-reality-in-the-criminal-justice/

&gt;  It found that when jurors drawn from 138 criminal trials were asked questions about crime prevalence and sentencing in the abstract, their responses mirrored those of general population surveys, in which 70-80% of respondents say that sentences are too lenient.

&gt; But when they were *in full possession of the facts*, 90% of the jurors said the sentence imposed by a judge was either ""fairly or ""very"" appropriate. And more than half suggested a more lenient sentence than judges actually imposed.

or http://www.uk.sagepub.com/cavadino/sentencing_trends_in_britain.pdf

&gt; *Research on public opinion over the past three decades has consistently established that the British public is critical of sentencers*, and that this criticism exists independent of crime trends and even dramatic changes in criminal justice policies. In the 1996 British Crime Survey, respondents gave significantly more negative evaluations to judges than to any other group of criminal justice professionals. The public systematically underestimated the severity of sentencing patterns, which was significantly related to attitudes toward sentencers. *When asked to provide a sentence in a specific case of burglary, respondents favored sentences that were on balance little different from, and if anything more lenient than, current sentencing practice.*

It is worth remembering that the media, and tabloids in general, prefer reports about the extreme and outlandish, and have little regard for the norm, which by definition is not news-worthy. This usually skews our perceptions about the state of things.
