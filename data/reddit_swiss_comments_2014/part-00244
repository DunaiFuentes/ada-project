For those groups such as Inditex (largest fashion retailer gropu in the world, owner of Zara, Massimo Dutti, and so on), the SGA (Selling &amp; Gen.

Yeah, basically the most expensive Orange young deal is the exact same thing as the most expensive MTV mobile deal, except it's 19.- more expensive than Sunrise. (Orange does include Spotify though) And anyway, it's min. 1 month not 12, so that is just great, too.

This is a really good deal for me because I'm gonna be calling my girlfriend abroad a lot, and all the other providers have a similar thing too, just way more expensive. (Cheapshit Swisscom only gives you 100mins with their 89.- contract. Assholes.) I just hope the signal strength is okay and that they don't fuck up my bills.
