We also know that for instance upc cablecom routes certain traffic in weird ways that caused for congestion problems in the past. If that was a business decision or a technical issue, I don't know.

The thing is, with all these internet providers entering new business branches that have hard competition elsewhere on the internet (Swisscom TV 2.0, Horizon etc.), they only now are starting to have an incentive as ISPs to filter (and slow down or block) the content they provide according to their benefit.

With their codex they say that they're not going to block any content, which is nice, but they still keep an option open to slow down any content according to any kind of rules, including business decisions. I think they don't go far enough and should vow to not discriminate against any content sources (maybe with one caveat: illegal or dangerous material).

TL;DR: No, not yet, but they keep that option open to them, which I think is a mistake. Strict net neutrality is important.

1) There's more than just Telekurs, Datatrans and Postfinance... those are just third-part payment processors, they are not network rails. The network rails would be Visa, MasterCard/Maestro, CUP, JCB, and a few others. You are free to integrate with them if you can get sponsored by an acquiring bank and then process transactions without going to a third-party payment processor. Since it's probably not worth it as a small/medium-sized business, you'll end up contracting with a third-party processor that does it for you. But you don't have to, by any means.

2) This is both a technical and a contracts issue. If you implement the contact-less EMV standard, you can interface with any contact-less EMV terminal and pretend to be a payment card. The NFC stacks in these terminals don't support anything else, there's no other option! Otherwise they would never get licensed under the standard.

I highly doubt Swisscom has created their own platform. If they are doing what you claim they are, the would have to a) pretend to be a debit/credit card issuer, b) have the mobile phone emulate a fake card, c) route the payment over a network rails to them, d) then re-route the transaction in their backend by routing over the ""correct"" rails for the customer.

On the terminal owner's point of view, they juste route the Tapit ""cards"" to Swisscom and make sure their terminals can interpret the answer. Swisscom then either processes or have the transaction processed.


I'm guessing money is made because the contract between Swisscom and the banks has a lower transaction fee than what the merchant could obtain alone with a bank or a payment gateway.


Swisscom is not alone in this gold rush. See what Migros is doing with the Cumulus card that you can top up (with a credit card !). They are  lowering the fees they pay by having customers make bigger and less frequent transactions from their credit cards.

false,csssss_,world,Auslandschweizer,"A network is something that routes credit card transactions from the acquiring (merchant) side of the transaction to the issuing (bank/customer) side. If you have a Visa-branded card, all transactions for that card are routed over Visa's network. If you have a MasterCard-branded card, all transactions are routed over MasterCard's network. The network can be identified by the BIN on the card (the first six digits of the card number). Different networks have different prefixes, e.g. everything that starts with a ""4"" is reserved for Visa. Everything that starts with ""5"" is MasterCard. American Express cards start with ""3"". Discover has ""6"", but has it shared with China Union Pay. And so on. 

When a card transaction is processed, the payments processor will look at the card number to extract the BIN. Based on the BIN, the network for routing will be determined. Then, the processor sends that transaction upstream to the correct network. The network (e.g. Visa) will then identify the proper issuing bank based on the card number. The transaction then gets forwarded to your issuing bank, e.g. CreditSuisse (or where your account is). Your bank decides if the transaction is OK or not (by checking funds if it's a debit account, validating the PIN, whatever). The response is then returned to the network, which then returns it to the processor. The processor returns the status of the transaction to the terminal. 

It is important to note that in general, the processor does not know which bank issued a card. It just sends it to the appropriate upstream network, the processor itself does _not_ talk to your bank. You can think of the network as a ""router"" for payments, it determines what goes where. 

Judging from their website, it looks like Tapit uses the MasterCard network to route transactions. This would mean that the card it emulates to the NFC terminal pretends to be from MasterCard. This is exactly what Google Wallet does (even if you add a Visa card, the phone pretends to be a MasterCard). Tapit would then act as the issuing ""bank"" for the transaction, and then subsequently run a separate transaction using the card you stored with them when a transaction is made on the proxy card.

This allows them to be accepted everywhere that MasterCard PayPass NFC cards are accepted. I'm led to believe this is the case since their homepage shows the PayPass logo, and they claim they have acceptance internationally at locations displaying the logo. 

Edit: It's also possible they do it separately for both MasterCard/Visa. But either way, it has to pretend to be some pre-existing card brand or it won't work. Or since they just have a subset of cards that are supported they could also implement EMVCo's tokenization standard and do something similar to what Apple Pay is doing... either way it looks like a crappy solution.
