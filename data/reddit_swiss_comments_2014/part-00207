I served with the explorateurs but had a friend who went through all the tests and courses to become a para. During this time, he was very excited about it: it was challenging physically, he got to do lots and lots of jumps.
He started basic training, but left voluntarily after one or two weeks. He said it wasn't the physical side of things that made him leave, he was in top shape. It was the mental pressure of constantly being made to feel as if you're a worthless thing, being harrassed constantly without any down time at all. The thing that disgusted him the most, however, is the fact that paras are trained to be high-functioning killing machines. They were taught how to kill with a pencil in the first week.
I guess what I'm trying to say is, don't do it if you're just in for the challenge - there are tons of other things you can do to test your limits. Be prepared to eat shit for all of the first few weeks, and most of all, to be taught how to kill effectively and efficiently.

&gt; Democratic tradition

The parliamentary system is close, yes, but most other countries have the same thing. The difference between our Federal Council and the Presidency in the US is extremely strong when you look at people's attitudes towards who's in power... sure, some councillors aren't liked by some people, but you won't find hate towards any Swiss politician like the hate towards Clinton, Bush or Obama in the US.

&gt; Liberal gun laws

Compared to the US? Hell no. You can't carry a gun, concealed or not, without a reason in Switzerland. You also can't buy one without passing simple background checks. That's lax compared to most other European countries, but extremely strict compared to the US.

&gt; Low taxes

OK...

&gt; We're practically a theocracy,  with state-supported ""official"" churches financed by corporate taxes.

None of our laws are based on religious beliefs. We don't have abstinence-only sex ed ""because sexuality is bad"", we don't ban abortions ""because lives are sacred"", we don't teach creationism in public schools ""because the Bible is true""... Switzerland is not a theocracy.

I don't think that word means what you think it means. A theocracy is a country ruled by religion, not merely a country whose government sponsors religions a bit.",0,1405864377,null,0,false,0,cj2jbcw,t3_2b659i,t1_cj2jbcw,t1_cj2iv7m,null,1434805664,2,false,Switzerland,t5_2qhp6,2

4. As others have mentioned, most open to the outside as this is for emergencies.

5. Yes. Yes, we are.

6. It's mostly because of the alps. Although it is very annoying at the moment.

7. Small country. Small roads. Small cars. Why would you need a giant pick-up truck for personal transportation and some shopping? Fuel efficiency.

8. Our water quality is excellent. Drink the tap water. Only buy water if there isn't a fountain around or if you want bubbles. (Fountains not containing drinking water are usually labelled with ""KEIN TRINKWASSER"" and/or an according sign. You could most likely also drink out of most rivers and lakes, especially in the mountains.

9. Depends on what kind of water heating system the house has. But yeah, mostly it's very fast.

10. Yes, but salaries are also high. I work as a cashier as a side job and I earn 25CHF /hour.

11. Yes, don't stare. Personal space is important, which also extends to staring. But, you are a tourist/foreigner so it's okay :P

&gt;The __International Phonetic Alphabet__, or __IPA__, is an alphabetic system of [phonetic notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phonetic_transcription) based primarily on the [Latin alphabet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin_alphabet). It was devised by the [International Phonetic Association](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Phonetic_Association) as a standardized representation of the sounds of spoken language. 

&gt;In the IPA, [vowel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vowel) sounds are defined as sound which occurs at a syllable center.  Below is a chart depicting the vowels of the IPA, with audio examples of each. The IPA maps the vowels according to the position of the tongue.

9. Older appartment buildings may have problems with that. In the appartment of an ex-gf, it used to take several minutes until the water from tha warm water pipe went from ice cold to warm in the morning.

10. Salaries are as high. A waiter gets 15-20+ CHF per hour.

11. Just random encounters or people you actually know? But yeah, some people tend to not look into someones eyes when talking to each other but rather at your mouth (I do that unconsciously) or things around you.

12. No. Some student parties do it as a gag, but in general, no.

13. Some restaurants do, some don't.

Yeah, this is due to an unfortunate combination of religious conservatives (""Sunday is holy"") and unionists who prevent the laws regarding opening hours to be reformed. 

&gt; Is the store ""Coop"" pronounced Co-Op or Coup?

In Swiss German, it's like ""cop"" in British English (i.e. *not* like cup), but the o is a little bit longer. In the TV ad, they do pronounce it co-op (with two distinct o sounds), but no one else actually pronounces it like that. 

&gt; Do Swiss people normally drink from the faucet?

Absolutely! It's readily available and at least as good as bottled water, why would you bother to carry bottles? :)

&gt; Water from the faucet gets extremely hot/cold very fast. I love it.
