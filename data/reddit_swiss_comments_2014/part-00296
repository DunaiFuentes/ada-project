In the US you probably can drive hours without reaching a town.

If you drive four hours from St. Gallen to Geneva you drive through at least 2 different languages (German and French) and at least through nine dialects.

And you have to consider we constantly mock other cantons (or other villages) for being different (and nobody likes Zurich (sorry guys^^)) But nobody likes the dialect of Thurgau either.

But as Zurich has the highest population of all the cantons, the probability that someone you meet from Zurich is an idiot is also higher. 

As I know people from Zurich don't like People from Thurgau, St. Gallen, Bern, Basel and Aargau. But according to the Tagesanzeiger Zürcher mostly emigrate to Aargau (Source: [I hope you speak German](http://blog.tagesanzeiger.ch/datenblog/index.php/5850/hohe-mieten-verdraengen-zuercher-in-den-aargau )) 

People from Hinterthurgau (the southern part) don't like people from Oberthurgau (you guessed it, the northern part) and vice versa I believe. Thurgau and St. Gallen also hold together against Zurich because we have a similar dialect.

And I believe Appenzell Innerrhoden and Appenzell Ausserrhoden don't like each other (that's why they're two of them (Innerrhoden is catholic and Ausserroden protestantic.))

*[Fun fact](http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frauenstimmrecht-Entscheid): Women in Appenzell Innerrhoden are allowed to vote since 1990 and only because the federal court said so.*    

What I heard from friends is that the Swiss people from the western part (where they speak French) don't like the Canton of Jura. I don't really know why but probably because Jura has become an independent canton 30 years ago and previously belonged to Bern.
