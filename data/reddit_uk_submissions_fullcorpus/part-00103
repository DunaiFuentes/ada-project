Taking into account that we sign Soldado (please!) - he asked me what the Starting XI + bench would look like for us. So I ventured a pop, and this is what I concluded.

My preferred XI considering everyone is fit.

Lloris

Walker, Kaboul, Vertonghen, BAE

Sandro, Dembele, Paulinho

Lennon, Soldado, Bale

The 4-3-3.

And then I'd put on the bench: Friedel, Dawson, Adebayor, Dempsey, Sigurdsson, Defoe, Holtby.

And then I realized... that would mean that the players who wouldn't even make the bench and would be essentially reserves would be the likes of: Rose, Caulker, Townsend, Huddlestone, Parker, Naughton, Carroll, Livermore.

That to me, looks like a REALLY REALLY REALLY stacked and talented squad. And I for a moment just thought, ""Damn, if Soldado comes in we have a fucking brilliant team in terms of depth!""

[Sandro Raniere Guimarães Cordeiro](http://www.uncleslamdesign.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/sandro.jpg)

&gt;Personal Info

Age: 24

DOB: 15/03/1989

Nationality: Brazilian 

Club History: Internacional (Youth) -&gt; Internacional (Free) -&gt; Tottenham Hotspurs (£9m)

&gt;Overview

In 2009 Spurs and Internacional agreed an affiliation of the two clubs, ensuring that Tottenham have first option on all academy players from the Brazilian outfit. In the following winter transfer window  Harry Redknapp confirmed he had signed Sandro for a fee rumoured to be around £8 million (he would join the following after the  Copa Libertadores - which he won). Sandro said of the move to England that he thought Spurs were ""a great fit for me"" and that ""a club that is growing every year makes it the ideal club for me"". Sandro signed a new five-year contract with Tottenham on 8 September 2011, a deal which will run till 2016.

In January 2013, Sandro picked up a knee injury during the game against Queens Park Rangers. After the game it was announced that Sandro would be out for the remainder of the 2012–13 season. Prior to the game, after a run of impressive performances Sandro has been affectionately nicknamed 'Beast' by the Tottenham fans.

Style wise Sandro is a hard tackling DM who's ball retention and ability to cleanly distribute in close quarters make him ideal for the premier league. His partnership last season with Dembele (prior to his injury) was deemed the greatest defensive midfield partnership in the league, the stats backed this up. 

||||||||
:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:
-|Goals Conceded per game|Tackles per game|Interceptions per game|Clearances per game|Mins per loss of possession|Pass accuracy|
Sandro|1.09|3.3|3.6|3.5|137|86%|
Parker|1.3|2.3|2.2|0.9|67|83%|

Parker is a premier league quality player, but his ability pales into insignificance in comparison to Sandro. Sandro is arguably one of the best players in the league at recycling possession. His high tackle/intercept rate coupled with his ability to retain possession and accurate distribution allows spurs to break down opponents in midfield and quickly counter (a huge boon with guys like Bale and Lennon operating in the wings). In 2013-14 we should all be excited about the prospect of the greatest defensive partnership in the premier league fuelling the likes of Paulinho, Bale, Chadli, Siggurdson, Holtby and possibly Soldado.

&gt;Info

- Sandro credits his quick transition to the English game to his Brazilian friend Gomes. He has stated he will look to take Paulinho under his wing in the same way.

- Prior to the 2014 World Cup, the Brazilian coach said there were only 1 or 2 players that had a chance of cracking the squad, Sandro was number one on the list giving him a huge incentive to show up this season.

- Sandro even refers to himself as the beast now.

&gt;Questions

- How do you expect AVB will integrate Sandro back into the squad granted his previous injury

- Do you believe spurs would have got top 4 last season with Sandro in the side?

- Do you think Sandro should play in the World Cup, if so, what should the Brazilian team look like?

-  Did you learn today, like me, that Sandro only just turned 24. Putting him in the same age bracket as young guys like Falque and Siggurdson.",false,coys,t5_2ryq7,null,null,self,Player Discussion: Sandro 'Beast',19,http://www.reddit.com/r/coys/comments/1j9lyo/player_discussion_sandro_beast/

I'm 24, and I live in Manchester. I moved here a few months ago after finishing university. I have a music related degree - I don't regret doing it and am slowly building freelance work out of it, but nowhere near enough to live off and I'm at peace with it only being a hobby. I've been looking for a job since I moved here and have had no luck. I'm starting to get seriously depressed and I don't know what to do anymore.

I originally couldn't claim JSA/housing benefit as I am living with my girlfriend who earns above what they deem enough for two. She is paying for family members back home so certainly didn't have enough spare to pay for me. She is leaving to go back home at the end of this month and I won't be going with her; we want different things but it's a five year relationship ending and just adds to everything else. 

As she is leaving work in two weeks, I've started to sign up for JSA/housing again. According to the online calculator I'm not eligible for housing benefit but I may have filled something out wrong and am waiting for an appointment. I am worried that after providing my bank account details I'll be rejected because they'll see monthly payments from my dad.

In terms of job searching, I feel like I'm completely stuck. I'm not an idiot and am skilled in general IT, am fit/strong and have good written/personnel skills but have very little experience (I grew up overseas where as a foreigner it was almost unheard of to work while at school) . Nearly every job I apply for I'm rejected almost instantly because of lack of experience; admin, retail, customer support. I can't do an internship at any of the ones (30+) I've applied for because I don't have the right type of degree. I can't do an apprenticeship because I DO have a degree. I've been rejected from jobs automatically because I don't have a driver's license, but can't afford to get it because I don't have a job. I am trying to find volunteer opportunities but have had no luck within 5 miles of me and anything further becomes difficult to travel to. I can't join the military because I have the mildest case of asthma. I'm applying for everything I find, even though I often don't meet the specs.

I've looked into doing some courses so I have some sort of qualification that might get my foot in the door, but the cost is totally out of reach to me.

Moving back to the country I grew up (i.e move back in with my mum) isn't possible as I need an employment pass to stay there, and they are becoming harder and harder to obtain (my parents who have been working there for a decade are struggling with it and it is based of work experience in the country, savings etc). No job out there is going to hire/sponsor me for an employment pass as it is expensive and I've get zero experience; cheaper for them to get local talent.

I've looked into moving to somewhere in Europe but as I don't speak any other languages an English speaking job is almost always in business/IT and again, I've not got enough experience to be considered for an interview. I could try and move somewhere else in the UK but it would be jumping into the dark and the upfront money required to move I can't come up with.

I have almost no friends (will be totally alone when my girlfriend leaves) and so have exhausted the two personal connections I have. I got an interview out of one, but again, they went with someone with experience.

I really don't know what to do anymore. I'm borrowing money from my dad every month and he can't afford to do it past the end of the year. My lease is up in 4 weeks and my landlord is asking me if I want to stay. I spend hours every day filling out forms only to get a negative check box and I don't even feel like a human anymore. I'm not sleeping, hardly eating.

I appreciate this is a huge wall of text but if anyone can offer me any advice I'd be very grateful.

As I see it 

Pros 

1. 86 million is a lot of money, that type of money would allow us to buy quality players for our squad and possibly up the wage cap to attract high quality players. 

1. Keeping a player who doesn't want to be at the club can be potentially damaging. They can have a detrimental effect on squad morale, not put in the necessary effort in training and matches, and can cause the club to become unfocused as the speculation and infighting/back biting continuing. 

1. Its happened before and we survived, Carrick, Berbatov and Modric were all central players to our successes but their departures did not destroy the club

Cons

1. Bale is an incredibly important player, central to our success and the way we play particularly over the last couple of years, it would be very hard near impossible to replace such talent

1. It may cement our reputation as a selling/breeder club where we put a lot of time, money and effort into developing and nurturing talent only for the big boys to come in and swipe them away as they become stars. We will never be able to move beyond our current position on the edge of the top 4 if this continues. 

1. It may/will take time to recover, I personally believe that loosing Carrick set us back a couple of years until we discovered and integrated Modric into the side. Bales potential departure could do the same or we could adapt.

We have been running for 4 years and this year will be our biggest and best event to date.

1. Gareth Bale is on a giant bill board in New York in a Tottenham shirt

2. Gareth Bale is on the cover of FIFA *2014* in a Tottenham shirt

We chatted quite a lot about tactics and stuff like that. He definitely got the best out of me last season and hopefully can again.” (actual words from Bale's mouth)

4. AVB has stated: “We have the chairman’s commitment that Bale will not leave the club.” (actual words from Andre's mouth)

5. Paulinho has stated: “Bale is their best player, but they have made it clear to me that he is not going anywhere.” (actual words from Paulinho's mouth)

6. Bale: 'We did a couple of seasons ago so there's no reason why not. We've definitely got a good enough team to challenge. It just depends on how consistent we can be. 'We're all looking forward to the season, hopefully we can improve on last season – I'm sure with a few more additions to the squad we'll be a lot better.' 'It's just a matter of going out there and proving everyone we can.' (courtesy of ExileTHFC)

Reasons why Bale is going:

1. Marca have continuously rehashed stories from the Modric saga and these stories have been syndicated. There are no real quotes.
2. A gooner reporter made up a story about us knocking back a 100 million euro offer and this story was syndicated. There are no real quotes.

Don't get sucked into this bullshit.

**UPDATE**

I ended up buying from ASDA, which is my closest large supermarket.

I got 1.5L of gin, 1.5L of vodka, 0.7L of 63% OP rum, and 0.7L of brandy. Cost around £90 all up, mainly because of the OP rum and brandy. The gin and vodka was very cheap. I think I'll disinfect my keyboard with it later.

I did contact a food grade ethanol manufacturer but then I learned that the excise duty is about £30/L of pure ethanol. So the price difference from ASDA wasn't that much different.

[Chelsea FC History Series: William ‘Fatty’ Foulke](http://www.reddit.com/r/chelseafc/comments/1iktyd/chelsea_fc_history_series_william_fatty_foulke/)

[Chelsea History: Stamford Bridge - Part 1](http://www.reddit.com/r/chelseafc/comments/1it5mh/chelsea_history_stamford_bridge_part_1/)

Chelsea soon showed that their good record in the first season was no flash in the pan. The following year they won promotion. 

New players who joined the club during the summer included George Henderson, Scottish international right half, [**Billy Bridgeman**](http://imgur.com/inWV1xb), an outside right from West Ham, [**Ted Birnie**](http://imgur.com/SXCWeYb), a wing half from Crystal Palace, Jimmy Frost, an outside right from Northampton, and Joe Walton, steady, sure kicking right back, who achieved the doubtful honour of being the first man to break a leg on the Stamford Bridge Ground. 

Former Captain, Foulke, now almost 26 Stone had left Chelsea for Bradford at the end of the previous season. He soon afterwards fell on hard times, and for a while earned a precarious living by touring fairgrounds. Standing between two goalposts, he invited local marksmen ‘*to have a go*’ at a penalty kick against the famous man himself. 

The new team captain was [**David Copeland**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Copeland_(footballer)), who left Chelsea the following season, and with Mickie Byrne injured and Bill Foulke gone, Robert Whiting nicknamed ‘*Pom-Pom*’  because of his powerful goal kicks, kept goal.

At centre forward, in place of goal scoring Frank Pearson in the opening game of the 1906-07 season was a young nineteen year old named George Hilsdon, despite much adverse criticism. George Hilsdon will get his own post so I won’t mention him much here. 

The first game of the season was played at Stamford Bridge under a scorching sun against Glossop. Chelsea beat the visitors by nine goals to two. George Hilsdon scored five goals and had a hand in the making of the other four. 

Chelsea won 26 of their games, scoring many goals in the process. They managed some results such as 5-1 against Bradford and 7-1 against Chesterfield Town. They scored the second most in the league (80) whilst conceding the least (34). 

Chelsea ended the 1906-07 season second in the Division II table, behind Winners Nottingham Forest, thus earning promotion to Division I. 

That the going would not be easy in the premier League became clear right at the beginning of their first season there. The club were confident enough, at the start, that they could hold their own among the first-class teams. Few new players were brought in to strengthen the team, although Frank Pearson, Dave Copeland and Mickie Byrne had all left. Jackie Robertson, too, had left the club the previous year and had not been replaced; but now, with First League football ahead, Chelsea appointed a full blown manager. He was [**David Calderhead**](http://imgur.com/RVFw915), a sphinx faced, kindly Scot who stayed on as Chelsea’s manager for 26 years. Calderhead, who had been manager of Lincoln City, was an old footballer and a great centre-half of the 1890’s. 

That season, too, there came a new keeper, [**Jack Whitley**](http://imgur.com/t9hmTbE) who was to keep goal for the club 127 league games, then to stay on twenty-six years as a trainer. From Lincoln City came diminutive Norman Fairgray, a brilliant outside left, and another new player was Jack Cameron, noted for his calm steady kicking and sound positional play, and twice capped for Scotland.

Critics declared that chelsea needed more new players if they were going to do well in First division football; the club replied they had confidence in the men who had done so well in the second division. 

Chelsea lost their first game in first league football, being beaten by Sheffield United 4-2 (in this game both Walton and Miller were injured); after 8 league games Chelsea had collected only 3 points. They were soon, in spite of a win at the Bridge against [**Newcastle**](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=oeoFoAhS1a0&amp;t=20) team that included such football immortals  as Jackie Rutherford, Peter McWilliam, Finlay, Speedie and Bill McCracken, assuring anxious supporters they were ‘*hunting talent with an open cheque book*.’

The two outstanding transfers to chelsea were William Brawn, [**Aston Villa**](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rRpv7tj51wY) and [**England**](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xx1UMBPrx40) outside right, needed to replace badly injured Martin Moran; and Fred Rouse, a bustling, vigorous inside forward from [**Stoke**](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZu-fHb1EEM). Rouse, by the way, was Chelsea’s first ‘thousand pound’ player and the tale is that, when Rouse was knocked over in his first game at the Bridge and lay inert on the ground, a voice was heard crying, ‘*Blimme, there goes a thousand quid*!’

Billy Brawn played his first game for Chelsea against Bristol City in November, 1907. In the first minute Brawn made an opening and put the ball to Hilsdon for the centre forward to score, and the team went on to win 4-1, a victory that lifted the club from bottom place in the league table. 

Despite these transfers the club did not fare well in the first season in league one, finishing 13th in the table, having lost 16 of their 38 games, won 14 and drawn 8, with an adverse goal average of 53 goals for and 62 against. 

Next season, 1908-09, the club did a little better. the half back line was strengthened by the transfer, from [**Derby County**](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akw-j0yUugQ), of Ben Warren. Ben had been England’s International right half for two seasons and was to go on appearing for [**England**](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=Nb36OBuFIuE&amp;t=37) and for the English League for another 3 seasons.

His tale is one of the tragedies of football; more sad not only because Ben was one of the finest right half backs the game has ever seen but also because the man himself was exceptional for his kindliness, courage and clean, sportsmanlike play. Ben played great football at Chelsea for 3 seasons, during the third season he was badly injured. Then followed a long illness, Ben’s savings were soon gone, the sick, worried man went out of his mind and put in an asylum, leaving wife and children in dire need. Ben Warren was well known, and a fund, supported generously by clubs,  players and the public was got together to aid his dependents. 

Two other new players of this time were Angus Douglas, a fast, raiding winger who stayed with Chelsea for 5 seasons before being transferred to Newcastle United at the end of 1913, and Percy Humphreys, an inside forward. With Whiting and Whitley as goalkeepers, Tommy Miller and Jack Cameron at full backs, Ben Warren, McRoberts, James Stark, halves, and Angus Douglas, Fred Rouse, George Hilsdon, Jimmy Windridge and Norrie Fairgray in the forward line, Chelsea improved their position in the table, finishing 11th with 14 wins and 15 losses. 

 But they plunged downwards again the following season 1909-10. Right from the start the Pensioners were in trouble, and after 15 games they were floundering four from the bottom of the table with only 10 points.

Their plight brought forth a crop of newspaper articles asking the familiar question ‘What’s wrong with Chelsea?’ and some pointed remarks on the halls. Incidentally it was about this time that many a Chelsea supporter, paying a visit to the Chelsea palace, might have seen as Fred Karno show called *The Football Match*, in which appeared many former professional footballers. The part of ‘stiffey the goalkeeper’ was played by a then little known comedian, a certain Mr. Charles Chaplin. 

Chelsea explained their falling away as due to injuries, unusually heavy that season,  for at one time no fewer than seventeen players were on the injured list. In dire need, Chelsea appealed to a famous amateur player,[**Vivian Jack Woodward**](http://imgur.com/TRE4bAP); he was playing for tottenham at the time but had once promised that if Chelsea wanted him he would join them. The need was great. 

One of the greatest inside forwards of all time the amateur from Essex played a fine fashioned game. People talked of his single runs with the ball often half the length of the pitch, his skill at avoiding the weighty and none too scrupulous attention of opposing defenders, his perfectly placed passes and the speed and freedom of his movements on the field. 

Woodward became a great favourite with football crowds everywhere, not only because of his skill but also because of his fine sportsmanship, for he was never known to foul or to retaliate fouls on him. When Woodward played, Chelsea were able to field an all England inside trio- Woodward, Hilsdon and Windridge. The frequent calls on Woodward and others for international  and representative games, however, made such a match winning combination too infrequent to affect Chelsea’s downwards fall.

Another player developing during this season was a young man named Walter Bettridge, who because of his injuries partnered Cameron at full back for a while in 1909. Bettridge described by Calderhead as the ‘pluckiest little player that ever pulled on a football boot’ was later to make a full back partnership with Harrow that would be recognised as one of the finest ever. Bettridge was one of the earliest and most effective exponents of the sliding tackle. 

Right up to the last, Chelsea struggled to avoid relegation; there was still hope when the last game came around, a match against [**spurs**](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=6USyWoGJ8OQ&amp;t=281). But Chelsea lost and it was a goal scored by Percy Humphreys, who had recently been transferred from Chelsea to spurs, that sealed the fate. Their record at the season’s end made dismal reading for they won 11 only out of 38 games and lost 20, their goal average reading 47 for 90 against.

Three friends and I from the US (2 from Philadelphia, 1 from Minnesota, and I'm from Arlington, VA) are flying over to Edinburgh at the end of September.  We're staying on N. Castle Street right downtown.

Purpose of the trip is to play a little golf.  Two of the guys are being sent over by their wives for their 30th birthday present.  We're playing at Gullane, Crail, North Burwick, and Rennaissance club.

Other than that, I've got the leading Saturday night to entertain myself before the other guys arrive and we'll have the trailing Friday off from Golf before we depart.

I'm interested in some local advice on places to eat, drink, and explore.  I'm a big Scotch fan, so advice on some favorites and where to drink it for a reasonable price would be appreciated.  Is the Scotch museum downtown worth checking out?

Furthermore, my Grandfather was born in Dumbarton, so I'm very excited for my first trip over to where my family is from.  Looking forward to taking it all in, meeting people, talking with people, and having fun.

One interesting fact about myself is that my father had a pocket watch chain that was awarded to my great grandfather in a football tournament.

**Analysis**

- [Number of votes for each number](http://i.imgur.com/xKVwLVB.png)

Nothing unsual here, especially since the latter choices were much more random than the first ones. 

- [Vote repartition by season](http://i.imgur.com/tvHaNHv.png)

I put pondered values as not all seasons had the same number of options (from 24 in 06/07 to 30 in 11/12), although it has very little effect on the results.

- [Vote difference with equal value](http://i.imgur.com/4AEU9sq.png)

What it means is *""how much more/less votes each season has compared to how much it would have if voters voted equally (711 votes for each)""*

- [Number of top votes by season](http://i.imgur.com/rUlXZYe.png)

Coherent with the previous graph

The possibilities...

- [Alternate representation](http://image.noelshack.com/fichiers/2013/31/1375114149-survey.png)

---

**Observations** 

- 5 of the 11 starters of the 2012 Champions League final are represented (Cech, Cahill, Mikel, Bertrand and Drogba)

- Lukaku and Chalobah winning despite not scoring for the first one and not playing a single minute for the second. Youngster bias? 

- Biggest travesty: 06/07 Drogba only getting 8 votes.

That's all!

For those who are interested...

This project started this past spring when Barnes &amp; Noble had a sale on certain British TV series on DVD. I picked up Doctor Who: The Complete First Series, half off here: http://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/dvd-doctor-who-the-complete-first-series/24563455?ean=883929262205

I had picked up the blu-ray Complete Specials set during a previous sale. The gap I had was series 2-4. Having some difficulty finding those sets individually, I ended up biting the bullet and picking up the impressive David Tennant Years set from WBShop.com, on sale for $105.19! This is their page for it: http://www.wbshop.com/product/doctor+who+the+david+tennant+years+1000224830.do

So now I had the entire Doctor Who run from Russell T Davies’ tenure. But the book-box the Tennant set came in presented me with two problems: its unwieldy shape would not fit on my shelf, spine out; and the case infamously scratched discs upon removal and replacement. So I gingerly liberated the discs (all 26!) to find the only one with any scuffing was Series 3, Disc 4. This is the disc with the modern classic episodes Human Nature, Family of Blood, and Blink. I thoroughly tested the disc, and I’m happy to say the scuffs were superficial only, not affecting playback on any of the episodes or their bonus features.

So what was I to do? I could have picked up some multi-disc keepcases, like I did when I planned to compile all five Sarah Jane Adventures series (I’ll save that for another post), but I came up with a different idea... a *better* idea.

I would build a TARDIS case, put each dvd (including the five from the first series) into square jewel cases, and stack them, laid horizontally.

I was inspired, primarily, by two individuals: Will Brooks, whose AMAZING DVD cases are shown here: http://www.youtube.com/user/nerd0vlog

And Dave Delisle, whose idea http://davesgeekyideas.com/2013/04/12/doctor-who-tardis-blu-ray-case/ I am quite blatantly ripping off. *In my defense, I don’t believe he actually made his.*

There are 31 DVDs among the four series and the Complete Specials. (I left my Blu-ray set alone, since the same content was included in the Tennant set, and I didn’t want to change format at the very end).

I worked it out so that I could distribute the 31 discs among 20 jewel cases: 10 single-disc cases; nine double-disc cases; and one triple-disc case.

DOCTOR WHO’S GREATEST MOMENTS


Pretty clean breakdown, no?

In my quest for a 20-case rack, I found a manufacturer of wooden CD racks here: http://cdracks.com/xcart/Model-109-1-CD-Storage-Rack.html

I paused at this point. I wasn’t sure I was ready to spend over $60 just for a wooden case, which I would then have to paint blue and make look like a TARDIS as to the best of my abilities--which I admit are wanting. So I paused on the rack, and found a temporary holder:

The LONG MAX CDB-20TI-BLUE, which I ordered here: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0081SDS4I

Moving on to the jewel cases:

I bought the one- and two-disc jewel cases at Staples. 

* Single-disc: http://www.staples.com/Staples-Standard-CD-Jewel-Case-24-Pack/product_390178

* Double-disc: http://www.staples.com/Staples-Double-CD-Jewel-Cases-10-Pack/product_392009

I had to order the triple-disc case online: http://www.sleevecityusa.com/slim-triple-jewel-case-assembled-p/9405.htm

I bought two different sets of jewel case inserts to use with my color laser printer: 
http://www.meritline.com/50-sheet-glossy-cd-jewel-case-inserts---p-20720.aspx (I bought that set at Fry’s: http://www.frys.com/product/3405763 )
http://www.staples.com/Memorex-White-Matte-Jewel-Case-Inserts-50-Pack/product_458693

I even picked up an adhesive sheet for the back and sides of the three-disc case, because it won’t take tray inserts on the inside.

For the assets, beyond the ubiquitous DW and BBC logos, I got most of the cover art from the wallpaper galleries here: 
http://www.bbc.co.uk/doctorwho/s4/episodes/S1_00#wallpapers

I got a couple of the Series 1 images here: http://spoilertv.co.uk/images/doctor-who/season-1/cast-promotional-photos

That should cover the art, but if you’re looking for something specific, let me know.

I’ve decided not to attempt the wooden TARDIS rack. The blue plastic holder I’ve got is good enough for a display piece, and I’m almost certainly going to upgrade to the recently-announced BD editions for the first four series.

I’d love to hear your thoughts, compliments (I’m only human) and complaints (I’m also a realist). 

CORRECTIONS: 

*I realized-- after printing, of course-- that the spine on Volume 8 is labeled “SERIES 3: PART ONE” while all other volumes use the numeral, i.e. “PART 1.” This error does not appear on the face, the back, or the opposite lip.

**I also call “The End of Time, Part One” the “Christmas 2009 Special,” while all previous Christmas specials put the year first. And I mislabeled that volume’s contents as Discs 5 and 6, when they are actually Discs 4 and 5.

Bad: 

Train tickets wouldn't print at Montparnasse, got to my parents house two hours late on Saturday. Europe travellers: apparently Rail Europe is notorious for this, be warned. This put me in a spectacularly pissy mood as I was up from 7am and eventually got a train at 13.05. That's a few hours in a bloody marvellous double bed I missed out on :( 

Wheel came off a very expensive suitcase (see bottom) going back to Paris to get the Eurostar home and I spent £45 on taxis because the damn thing would barely move with just one wheel and was too heavy to lift, didn't have time to find duck confit which I'd been craving or to buy perfume at Gare du Nord, **had to leave a third of a pint to rush to get the Eurostar**, then got saddled with a seemingly just been made pregnant woman with a huge backside on the Eurostar who had no concept of personal space and kept putting her huge butt virtually on my lap, her weirdly soft chubby elbow across me and then *her fucking paper just tossed onto my iPad when she'd finished with it*. All of the trains back to Paris were delayed by 1.25-1.5 hours too, hence the lack of finding duck goodness, despite originally having nearly three hours between train and Eurostar. 

Woke up to find a dead bird outside my room on Sunday morning. I believe the cat objected to my closed bedroom door! 

Good:

Got to spend some (but not enough) time with my parents and their devil cats in their little tranquil part of the world, and other than the three insults received, also had two compliments from my mother (she must be slacking). She also did my ironing - win! Came away with a load of free cosmetics, perfume and a list of interesting war films to look up. Also saw deer running across fields and all other kinds of lovely wildlife. And the sky. And trees. None of which I see from my flat. 

The double bed at my parents house is dreamy and I had the best night's sleep I've had all year. 

Eurostar's food is now made by Waitrose. 

(It took me five years to find a replacement suitcase I like after being burgled, and now the plastic bit where the wheel was is ruined)

I'm coming over from Melbourne Australia for a little holiday and I thought I might try and sort a few shows whilst I'm in England. 

Does anyone know of any good pubs that would take on a folk/punk guy from Australia for a night (opening a gig or whatever, payment negotiable) in mid-October (specifically, the 20th)?

Or maybe it did happen as the stories go and The Doctor doesn't want to come to terms with something that he can't control, because he does have that sort of personality. Maybe he likes to think he never encountered Jesus. Or maybe Jesus and The Doctor had an epic adventure together and the Doctor just isn't sure how to explain all the mysteries surrounding Jesus's actions!

 I charge very low rates because I am doing this just as much for the wider environmental benefits as the personal economic ones.

The train she passed through Five Ways, and at New Street she was fine
But up ahead the wind blew down a tree across the line

The train she stopped in Aston, hesitated then turned off her engine
Confused passengers turned to spread rumours in each direction

""An obstruction on the line"" proclaimed the driver, ""The train will terminate here""
Four score and twenty travelers emptied out with passage home unclear

Shall we wait for a bus to take us? The 115 has 'Sutton Coldfield' on its side
But turns down Penns Lane, then through Falcon Lodge - a truly epic ride

The buses would be packed, be they single or double deck
Guiltily I touched the albatross feather around my neck

I chose to walk up Lichfield Road, through blowing wind and rain
At every bus stop looked o'er my shoulder in case a bus it came

I spied the Spaghetti Junction underpass but my nerves would not allow me
To enter alone the darkened tunnel for risk of people scary

I saw a lady cometh t'ward me, we spoke through the terrible weather:
""Are you also heading 'neath the Junction? Shall we travel through together?""

I asked fair maiden where she was headed, ""To Four Oaks, further up the line.""
""P'raps place your faith in a bus,"" I said, ""your walk is longer than mine.""

We emerged unscathed upon Gravelly Hill, the land windswept and barren
Bidding her safe journey I sped ahead t'ward nursery and my waiting children

Through Erdington I trudged, the blue lights of Big John’s made me pause and wait,
But rumbling stomach was dismissed as I forged on to Lyndhurst Estate

The rain it poured, the wind it blew, I passed Atlantis Fish Bar
The battered sausages looked good, but there was just one thing I wished for

I prayed still for a saving grace, an angel or a bus
The driver should accept my train pass with minimum of fuss

But not one bus it passed me, save one headed for Castle Vale
Not a 902, a 904 or a 905 passed for me to hail

Bus stops, bus stops everywhere
All with passengers waiting
Bus stops, bus stops everywhere
But not one bus for taking

I passed the Wylde Green public house; it looked enticing in the rain
But my thoughts were led to wonder if I’d see my daughters again

But lo! A bus! A 905! Unburdened in its load!
But I had crossed and was now walking on the wrong side of the road

“Fear thee not,” I assured myself, “you have not far to go”
“And looking back on this you will laugh, I promise this is so”

I'm 17 and I currently get paid £5/hour. Working 5 hours a week.

Anyway, here are my questions:

* My boss pays me in cash on a weekly basis. But is that even legal? My dad raised concerns but I have no problems as long as I get paid.

* When I turn 18 I'm entitled to a (marginally) increased pay. But how would I go about getting the rise if she didn't give it to me? As far as I know I don't have a formal contract with her, so there's nothing saying I'm actually employed by her.

* Similarly, my boss agreed verbally to pay me for school holidays where I would usually work. However because I was away on the last day of the term when I would usually work, she didn't pay me for the holidays. This isn't the first time either, I'm pretty sure she's underpaid me by about £50 total. Is there anything I can do about that?

* What rights am I actually entitled to?

However, since WWII, if not before, it is regarded as the norm that we have a house to ourselves at some point, after scrambling onto the property ladder ('An Englishman's home is his castle').

But earlier today I was driving my dad to the local train station, and this brand new Ferrari comes up quite quickly behind me. Thinking it would be some asshole I didnt really pay much attention but my Dad looked at the license plate (Which said somethint along the lines of MA TIC) and raised the question if it was a footballer.

So I got home and searched 'Matic' on google and a certain ex-Chelsea Nemanja Matic comes up, who was rumoured to be rejoining Chelsea from Benfica. I recognised him as the guy in the car, so I'm 95% sure it was him. The area that I saw him is around an hour and a half away from London, and I dont know if that would be close enough. But I was thinking possibly about a family home somewhere quiet in Suffolk?

&gt;Dear Mr. tgjj123,
&gt;
&gt;Thank you for your email of 22 July, the contents of which have been duly noted.
&gt;
&gt;On the whole, I believe that the internet is a force for good. It is central to our lives and our economy, and Ministers have to be wary about passing legislation which might stifle it. Nevertheless, the internet has also brought a number of problems, with easy access to pornographic material definitely being one of them.
&gt;
&gt;Taking these considerations into account, I am pleased to say that a good deal of progress has been made in helping parents to restrict their children's access to inappropriate material. For instance, the four main domestic internet service providers (BT, Sky, TalkTalk and Virgin Media) have recently introduced a requirement for new customers to choose if they want to switch on parental controls to avoid children seeing inappropriate content.
&gt;
&gt;Thank you again for contacting me about this important issue.
&gt;
&gt;Kind regards,
&gt;
&gt;James Clappison MP

My boyfriend and I are thinking of going on a cheap holiday to northern France at the end of the summer by car. I'm the one who will be driving, and while I consider myself a reasonably good driver, I'm always cautious and I don't think I have enough experience to call myself a ""great"" driver yet.

I've been looking on the internet for tips for driving in France but most websites only talk about requiring breathalysers and warning triangles - they don't talk about the differences in actual driving experience.

So I have a few questions! Hopefully some of you will be able to help answer them:

* What's it like actually driving on the wrong side of the road (we will take a British car, so right hand drive)?
* How long did it take for you to adjust?
* What was it like the first time you tried it?
* Apart from the obvious (different road signs, different speed limits etc) is there anything I need to be aware of?
* Is there anything I can do for the next month (in the UK) to practise or to help me when I get to France?
* My boyfriend won't be driving but I know he will have to help me when I overtake or make left turns - is there anything he can do now to prepare?

We are only 22 years old - our parents are fine with us going but don't want us coming back dead, hence the preparation!

I'm a solo traveler from the states, and I'm going to be in London in a few days. I tried to visit Oxford about a month ago, but I got a late start, and it was a Sunday, so everything closed and there was some crazy festival going on, so it was very strange. I'm looking for a re-do.

Questions: I am a Tolkien-lover, and I know that the Bodleian Library houses a number of his original manuscripts. I have already done a good deal of research regarding obtaining a visitor's reading card for a day, but it really looks like you need to be doing *academic research* in order to see the special collections. I graduated university 2 years ago and will begin graduate studies this August, but neither degree is/was related to literature. Does anyone know what the rules are here?

Otherwise, last time I was in Oxford, I had done zero research, so I mostly just wandered about, looked at the old architecture, ate at the Eagle &amp; Child Pub, looked into some old churches, and wandered about more. Any ideas on what I should do this time? I would love to see the countryside, but I won't have a car, so that's basically out - so maybe there are some secret cool things to do in town? I would really appreciate any suggestions!

Anyway, do you have a special story about Istanbul? Perhaps you have an amazing story about getting there, or maybe you have a tale similar to 'Beating Berlusconi' or 'Will'. I have a story that's not as spectacular, I wasn't there, I didn't meet anyone famous on the night, but after that game, Liverpool and I formed a close bond that will last a lifetime.

My story pretty much begins on that night in May. To be honest, I was never exactly passionate about football before Istanbul. I never watched it much, but I do remember seeing the second leg of the Semi-Final at my granny's house. My mum was the only passionate red in the room, but I obviously supported Liverpool on that night alongside her. The rest of the room consisted of a Chelsea fan and 'neutrals' that were (and still are) United fans. I can remember the Gudhjohnson's miss (did I get anywhere close in spelling there?) and the relief that even I felt after that.

On the night of Istanbul, I didn't even know the final was on. I was sitting playing my PlayStation, and I heard 'Come on Liverpool, COME ON LIVERPOOL!' Being shouted from the living room by my mum. I thought 'Crash Bandicoot can wait, let's see what's going on out there.' And I walked into the living room.

Boom. My foot hits the ground.

""In towards GERRARD!""

""Hello! Hello! Here we go!""

As soon as I saw the goal, my eyes were glued to the Telly. I almost felt that when Stevie was waving his arms, he was saying ""Come on in, we need you!"". From that moment, I was a red for life.

Two goals later, I'm sweating buckets. After the 90 minutes, my mum sprinted to the toilet. ""Don't. Leave. This. Room."" I remember being told. My mum was convinced that I was a lucky charm of some sort. 

Another stand out moment is the Dudek double save. The ball was lobbed in, and by second nature, I screamed out ""NO!!"" And Dudek makes the save. I gasp, and he saved again. I was speechless. I just looked at my mum, and looked back at the TV.

I don't think I blinked during the shootout, and it's the only part of the game that's a bit blurry in my mind. I think that it was the nerves. All I can remember is my dad coming in during the shootout, and when we won, he picked me up as We shouted the house down. After that, I had the longest sore throat I've ever had, but it was worth it. 

So, that's my story. I know that it's nothing really special, just incredible co-incidence. But if the stars aligned that night and that I had *anything* to do with that game, that will be everything I hope to do in my life complete. I'm sorry if you thought that it was long-winded and a waste of your time, but a comment in a previous thread made me want to post it.",false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,null,null,self,Do you have an Istanbul story?,21,http://www.reddit.com/r/LiverpoolFC/comments/1jdksv/do_you_have_an_istanbul_story/

They are testing Levy's resolve, trying to create a spark and try to get Bale way under what the demands are by trying to force a transfer. Unless Bale himself makes the same or worse situation at club than Modric did last summer (which I seriously doubt he'd do to the club), he'll be staying here this summer.

I don't understand how you know who's registered for what, how much they'll charge, if there's a consultation and other legal mumbo jumbo. I know I'm not eligible for legal aid.

I've been to citizens advice and shelter with my case, and their advice is normally ""hmm, maybe you should get legal advice?""

I searched for solicitors near me, and went to the nearest one. Big mistake. It was basically a sink piled high with washing up as a reception room and two offices off the 'reception' room.

Context: Estate agent (now dissolved) signed a contract saying they'll protect my deposit, instead they give it to the landlord who went bankrupt (yet to be proven) and mobiusescape never sees her deposit again. I try to take them to court online, gets rejected for being the wrong type of case.

Any help or guidance would be useful.

Edit: I'm not sure I was very clear. My main concerns were:

1) How do you chose a lawyer / solicitor? What's the difference?

2) How much do I know they'll cost without paying for a consultation for each of them?

3) Do they charge by the hours that I spend with them, or the hours that they work on the case?

4) Iis there a way to look at feedback from previous clients?

5) Does it make a difference who I go to in regards to claiming the money back from the other side?

I appreciate people linking me to websites about the law, however I am currently interested in the next steps to get legal help.

--------------------------------------------------

**Mock the week** 

* Liverpool have certianly [been busy this window!](http://i.imgur.com/w0qTK.gif) Luis Alberto, Kolo Toure, Iago Aspad and Simon Mignolet have all joined in attempt to boost our top 4 chances. 

* Liverpool owners earlier this week came out and made it very clear that suarez is not for sale. On his twitter account John Henry famously tweeted ''*what are they smoking over there at the Emirates?*'' much to the amusement of the footballing world, but some argue that [his other tweet that was quickly deleted and sent directly to Arsene Wenger was much more appropriate regarding the current situation..](http://i.imgur.com/Q76MFLq.gif)

* In their desperation, Arsenal made a club record bid of £40m and 1 pound in what they thought would trigger Suarez exit clause...[however it was not only the wrong fee humiliating Arsenal](http://i.imgur.com/7cwFzwJ.gif) but it also means no futher bids from arsenal are welcome and liverpool [now hold all the cards](http://i.imgur.com/36HTEnu.gif)

* It's also worth noting that not only have Arsenal failed to capture Suarez but [any of their transfer targets this window..were not bitter about it though](http://i.imgur.com/4V3sysu.gif)

* This week Reina secured a loan move to Napoli. While there were mixed feelings between liverpool and Reina, most fans are happy to see Reina [go off to be with our Rafa once again](http://i.imgur.com/WULpUP6.gif)

* Many fans were questioning whether or not BR's young player policy could actually work and provide results so during the pre season all eyes were on Coutinho, Sterling and Ibe..[I guess you can say some fans are now *kinda* optimistic about what they're capable of](http://i.imgur.com/26zz74a.gif)

* Despite his age, wonder boy coutinho who continued his oustanding form on tour, insists that despite individual praise [he can handle the pressure and he's here to help the team anyway he can](http://i.imgur.com/DnYiDJ2.gif)

* Kolo Toure made a fine start to his liverpool career helping us not concede a single goal during our preseason friendlies, while most believe his experience is invaluable others believe [that his best days are behind him and that older players should give way to young up and comers](http://i.imgur.com/12GEBtb.gif)

* Just as liverpool secured the signing of Luis Alberto, Everton managed to secure a season long loan for Gerard Deulofeu, both former barca wonderkids. However, while Everton have to send theirs back, [we get to keep ours](http://i.imgur.com/ErntEPo.gif)

----------------------

**The Rumour Mill:**

* Liverpool are reported to have lined up a deal to bring Left back Lorenzo Melgarejo over from Benfica on loan. The 22 year old would certainly fit our transfer criteria and as we only have 1 injury prone/reliable left back, [we really need another decent one](http://i.imgur.com/4mjneym.gif)

* Even though we've been linked more times than a switch board, Christian Eriksen is still rumoured with a move to Liverpool. Former LFC player Ryan Babel and current Ajax teammate tweeted that he had been *educating Eriksen about Liverpool*.. [Lets just hope he persuasade him](http://i.imgur.com/mHJEGil.gif)

* ...oh and despite all hope being lost earlier in the window, things have changed and were now back in the chase to sign either [Papadopoulos or Alderweireld](http://i.imgur.com/JmMn7oj.gif?1)

* This week's wildcard has the same likelihood of happening as us getting bought out by north korea, Torres once again is apparently on our radar looking to seal a £20m switch back from chelsea. I think the majority of Liverpool fans can agree [they have finally moved on](http://i.imgur.com/j1NxmyP.gif)

[Laste Dombaxe](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-QeUylMiFPyA/Ueo-lhyN_PI/AAAAAAAAAFg/Anh80H7D20Y/s1600/Shaq+Coulthirst.jpg) -- Pronounced Lasstee Dombasstee.

&gt;Personal Info

Position: Box-to-Box Midfielder

Age: 18 (15/5/1995), was 17 last season.

Nationality: Angola

&gt;Overview

Dombaxe is an exciting prospect, a very young player who is quickly establishing himself as a starter in the stacked U-21 side. Originally a DM, Dombaxe has evolved his game to match that of Dembele's, his ball retention/dribbling skills create space for others high up the pitch and he can pick a line piercing pass if needed. He is currently used in the midfield 3 of a 4-3-3, but no longer as DM. This is an achievement in itself when you consider the competition in this position (Bentaleb, Carroll, Mason, Ceballos etc). On top of this, Dombaxe has obvious leadership skills, leading the club at U17, U18 and U21 level (at 17 years of age).

Dombaxe was scouted by spurs at the age of 15 and joined in January 2011. Whether or not he will eventually crack the senior side is too tough to tell at this moment as he only just turned 18 and likely still has 3+ years of development left before questions are asked. The youth squad mirrors the senior team in a number of ways, one of those is the similarity in potential 4-3-3's. A wall in midfield will be presented at senior level via Dembele/Sandro/Paulinho with serious threats up front in Bale/Soldado(?)/Chadli. If creativity is needed Holtby/Siggurdson are waiting in the wings. This setup is mirrored very closely at youth level, Luongo/Dombaxe/Veljkovic (a converted CB) is a common sight in midfield with the likes of Pritchard/Obika/McEvoy operating in front. If creativity is needed Bentaleb is in the mix too.

At his current age, granted his ability, Dombaxe is certainly one to keep an eye on. If he can continue to impress in next gen / U21 PL a loan call up may not be too far away. With Luongo on loan to Swindon this season, a midfield role is there for Dombaxe to take.

&gt;Info

- [There is this I guess](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-rH35L9t4o)

- Dombaxe is the go to guy for penalties at youth level, not that it is a required skill at spurs. 

&gt;Comments on performance from those who watched him live (thanks WindyCoys)

- Always efficient in his use of the ball (always looking to pass and move intelligently) and generally effective in his work off the ball too.

- Calm, strong, clever – an excellent performance from him. Always on hand to receive the ball when his team-mates were in trouble, and normally used it well. A few slack passes, but with the number of bodies and pressure in midfield, that was understandable. He took his first penalty well, and it was just a shame that he couldn't get the winner that his performance deserved.

&gt;Questions

- Do you believe Dombaxe holds a place in our strongest U-21 side (with loans and without)?

-  Granted the player is showing ability at such a young age, what is the appropriate time to loan someone like this out, keeping in mind Coulibaly has seen  a loan at a similar age.

They used a delivery service called Yodel and they are truly terrible. This is what happened:

I ordered the items from Amazon
Yodel tried to deliver them to me but I was out so they gave me a card. ""Your delivery, your call"" they card stated so I went to their website and rescheduled the delivery for the next week since I would be away the next two days.I got an email confirmation.
When I got back there were two more cards for Yodel saying they tried to deliver my parcel.
I call them asking why they ignored the reschedule but they just kept saying they tried delivering to me three times and now I had to go to their service centre in Gatwick to pick it up. I live in Hove and I don't have a car so that would cost me £10 in train fare and take me 3-4 hours. They say they can put in a request for a redelivery the next day but cannot guarantee anything.
I stay in all of the next day but nothing comes. I call them the following day restating everything and they give me the number to the Amazon customer service and tell me to make a complaint!? I call Amazon who also tries to get them to get my parcel to me but they get the same response. Yodel says they can send a request for a redelivery but they cannot guarantee it. So they same story again. I say that's not good enough, now I have to wait for Yodel to send the item back to Amazon and for them to process it to get a refund. End gain: nothing.

TL;dr I rescheduled a delivery from Yodel, they ignored it and not even Amazon could get them to resend it.

I couldn't see anything on who will send my parcel when I ordered though Amazon.co.uk. Is there any way we could still use Amazon but not use Yodel?

UPDATE
My wife complained on twitter and their twitter person responded. Yesterday there was a buzz on the door and the package (that we had decided was going to go back to Amazon for a refund) showed up. The Yodel guy looked really grumpy and the parcel had a note on it to be delivered that morning. An hour later their twitter person email my wife and said she had pulled some strings. Lucky we were in! :) Hopefully these complaints mean they will sort things out. One can only hope...",false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,null,null,self,Awful service from Yodel.

It's great that people will vehemently defend Roman on r/soccer, especially in threads such as the one about Human Rights abuses in the UAE or after that Matthew Syed appearance on SSN. I have refrained from doing so, I did write a response here once which somebody linked to over there and it was then barraged with votes. What I write is for you guys, I could not care less what other fans think

My biggest issue with this website, and internet discussion in general, is that every viewpoint is given equal credence, as is every commenter bar the obvious troublemakers. This is simply ridiculous. Regarding Roman, I'm bored of seeing children comment on the thought processes and decision making of one of the richest, most successful men in the world. They have no idea as to how the real world works, let alone the rarified atmosphere of Billion Pound deals. I hate to be so blunt, but I'm sure most of you who have read my comments have figured out that I'm not exactly short of a few notes, yet I would never dare suggest that I understood the complexities of the moves that Roman and other such businessmen make, and I manage a very large company myself along with my Father who co-founded a company sold for several hundred million Pounds. It's difficult to explain the stupidity of comments that claim to understand what Roman is doing and why he purchased the club, why don't we get Kim Kardashian to teach Professor Hawking the finer points of theoretical astrophysics while we're at it, it would be equally informative and accurate

A lot of this stemmed from that Matthew Syed interview on SSN which is now held as some definitive moment in the public understanding of football ownership by less than Heavenly figures. Bollucks. It just shows how fucking clueless people are if they will happily regurgitate the claims of one man as fact. This argument is always conflated by the defenders in to ""Well he's right about the way Roman amassed his fortune"" as if that is valid justification. Everybody knows this, you could not make a fortune during the Cowboy Capitalism days of neonatal free-markets in the former USSR without being a combination of ruthless, quick, decisive and canny. It's such a vapid argument that because Syed correctly repeated this well-known fact, everything else he says must be true also. The idea that being an owner of a Football Club would protect you from the long hand of Putin is without basis too, yet it's now repeated by many as fact. The brazen way in which the Russian leadership deals with it's enemies means nobody is safe, anybody with any sort of background knowledge of the numerous incidents involving 'Russia's enemies' would laugh at the notion that owning Chelsea is protection

Which leads me to another issue. When did Roman become Putin's enemy? Apparently this is true, many people are saying so therefore it must be. Only it's completely wrong, Roman was lauded for his immense charitable efforts and the pumping of funds back in to Russia via Chukotka, the Russian Football team (he paid Hiddink's wages personally) and large sponsorships of Russian sports teams along with endowments to museums, art galleries and other artistic endeavours. When he wanted to resign from his post as Governor, Putin refused and demanded he stay, not only as a shining light to other Ogligarchs but because of the good he was doing. It's part of an approach that publicly shames those who have hoarded wealth and run away, while showering praise on those who are seen to be giving it back to the people. The fact that Roman still works in Russia is enough proof that he is not on unfriendly terms with Putin, if he were that would be the last place on Earth he would ever set foot

Anyway, I've rambled on long enough. My point is, don't bother arguing and wasting your time with people who haven't got a clue as to what they are vehemently arguing for. You won't win as the majority is against you and nobody cares about the facts you present as it isn't what they want to hear. All you should care about is that unlike some other Billionaire owners (Spurs, Villa, etc.) yours is a man who has lavished vast funds to make this club the force they are today, whose Son is being groomed to take the reins (when 'everybody' knew Roman would leave within a year or two of taking over) and who attends more games than almost any other owner I can think of.

RUMOURED QUOTE from Salvo ""Total agreement Tottenham and Valencia.""

JOURNO: 15 mill + 15 mill in three instalments. It is customary to pay a 5% of the player's contract to his agent in Spain. Llorente has signed this with Toldrá (players agent). Salvo willing to pay 350.000, Toldrá want 700.000. Toldrá had 5% of each year of contract agreed. Now Soldado leaves halfway into the contract and they want all 5 years. Ridiculous. Valencia have already been quite flexible. Agreeing to negotiate amicably the 30m. Also with the installments

QUOTE: Salvo: ""It depends on the agents. Either they agree the terms, or Soldado leaves with us for the US""

Translation: It appears that there is an agreement to sell Soldado between clubs. However, of Soldados 3m Euro salary the agent wants 5% (customary). The discrepancy is that Soldado had signed a 5 year deal which means the agent wants 700.000, the club are only willing to pay 350.000 as he will be terminating contract half way through (makes sense).

Interesting bit: The 5% and 700.000 confirm that Soldado is on 3m euros a year at Valencia. 

Either way, Salvo's quote confirms this will be sorted before Valencia fly to the U.S this afternoon.

I’m the marketing manager at Curve Studios. We’re an independent developer and publisher in Central London and currently working on several Vita and PS3 titles.

We’re looking for an intern for four weeks. It’s unpaid, but we’ll cover your travel within London and give you some money each week for lunch. Hours and days are generally flexible.

If you’re interested drop an email to rob.clarke@curve-studios.com with your CV and a quick covering letter.

Responsibilities

• Social Media: We’ll put you in front of Twitter and Facebook day one, and we’ll expect you to be able to pick up interesting Tweets (Not just sales or self-promotion stuff) quickly.

• Blog: Writing for our blog, both promotional and informal posts, as well as coming up with ideas for what to write about.

• Asset Management: Helping our production guys and marketing to make sure things like screenshots, trailers and art assets are all going to the right people at the right time.

• Research: Making sure our press lists make sense and are up-to-date, looking at how other developers and publishers are approaching certain topics and collating press coverage.

• Admin: You won’t have to make the coffee (we have a machine for that), but you will have other similar exciting tasks such as updating spreadsheets and mailing out competition prizes. The games industry is a glamorous place.

Requirements

• Some sort of experience in social media, pr or marketing. That could be part of a school project, a degree you are working towards, a website you run or write for, that sort of thing.

• Mad Twitter skills. You don’t need to have 2,000 followers but it helps if you’re active and contribution on at least one form of social media (Yes, Reddit counts).

• You need to play, enjoy and generally know about indie games and have a strong idea of why people like to play them. We don’t just mean you’ve played Minecraft on your 360 – if you don’t know what a Roguelike is or aren’t aware of recent games like The Swapper and Gunpoint, this probably isn’t for you.

• Excellent English skills. You need to be able to write engaging copy in a variety of different styles. Check out our blog for an example. 

• Some basic technical skills would be strongly preferred – the ability to use an FTP, resize images and make attractive PowerPoint presentations all come in very handy.

We'd love to hear what Reddit thinks about the book and I'd love to hear about how you would go about promoting a novel like this.

Here is the synopsis:
A fictional story but sadly the scenario's and the actions of the characters are not just figments of the imagination. Scotland's attitude to people with a learning disability and mental health problems may just be called into question.

When did Scotland last qualify for a major football tournament, Victorian Times? When did Scotland stop incarcerating vulnerable people, Victorian times? Tragically both are less than two decades ago.

It's the early eighties and Alastair Robson is at a key milestone in his life. He has become sadly aware that he can no longer blame society for his lack of gainful employment. His interest in alcohol, sex, giro's and loyalty to his best mates are not exactly setting him up for life, a fact which his girlfriend and family keep reminding him of. Reluctantly and despite his best efforts he finds himself with the unenviable task of caring for unfortunates placed in a locked ward. Alistair is drawn into a world of abuse, violence and unsavory characters. Are the patients or the carers the ones who need help and how does an immature care assistant rationalise and understand the issues in a society where nobody cares. A socialist Scotsman like Alistair can only resort to humour, alcohol and women whilst exhibiting a bad case of underdog as he and a few friends takes on a hierarchy he thinks is depriving patients of their basic human rights. Not quite a true David versus Goliath encounter but a more ""sleekit"", ""snidey"" and ""backstabbin"" Scottish version.",false,Edinburgh,t5_2rffi,null,null,self,My Dad has written a book based on some of his experiences while working in an Edinburgh hospital for people with learning difficulties.

I'm originally from the Liverpool area but have lived in the US for quite some time. This is also my first post and I am pretty new to this sub so here we go.

Here is what I have to say. I am kind of in two boats here. On one hand if Suarez leaves I do not believe we are doomed since I think we can use those funds to attract 3 pretty quality players (8-12mil range). The facts are that Sturridge was a great pickup, Coutinho was an amazing signing and, realistically, Aspas looks to be comfortable in our system with great movement and an understanding of our playing style. While he's not the marquee signing we're hoping for, the turn for the goal and assist against Thailand made me feel comfortable with him in our team.

I don't want Suarez to go at all but if he stays we run the risk of a highly emotional player, who will do what he wants to get his way, on our hands. His attitude and performance may slip and we could be left with an underperforming and less valuable player.

I have seem some fans really blow everything up about this and write him off as gone; burning jerseys, and insulting him on social media. We have a highly reactive person here and none of this helps. 

The question is if Suarez is still a player game 1 vs. Stoke (I know he wont be playing) what would you all think about the home fans getting behind him and singing our Suarez song as loudly as they can ? The last thing we need is to have our fans chant against him and either him force his way out late or sulk until January. 

It would also be nice if we got some media attention of how much we support our players and a positive spin on this whole situation. So there we go, let me know your thoughts.",false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,null,null,self,Supporting Suarez,19,http://www.reddit.com/r/LiverpoolFC/comments/1jfgh9/supporting_suarez/

I essentially randomly chose Forest - they seem to have wonderful history, a good following, and the current funds to be making some moves. I've read some on the broader history of the club, because that's easy to find.   

What I would really love is a good recap of the last few seasons, as well as a preview for the coming season. I'd like to know what the fans think of our current players, what we need, strengths/weaknesses, recent years' play styles, and all that good stuff.

Being bored and at work late I modified the order number and discovered I could view other customers orders. This gives away what they ordered and for how much, along with their names, billing and delivery addresses, the last four digits of the credit card number used and the expiry date. About the only thing that is really obscured is the order date which defaults back to year 0001. I'm guessing all that I require to view this information is an account on the site and a URL to modify.

Rose finally knowing for sure what he was going to say to her on the beach when he had to leave her in the parallel universe. (I do however, wish there was a little more story about the half human Doctor staying with Rose.) 

The Waters of Mars was a great episode. Doctor Victorious! Showed how much he loved the human race and how the Doctor needed to have someone a companion with him to help him think clearly. Showed that he could be ""human"" too. The last 2 episodes were just... wow. A great season finale. Gallifrey and the Time Lords coming to Earth. The doctor thinking Donna's Grandfather was the one who was going to Kill him for good. That part also confused me. Why did the Doctor regenerate when he did? Was is from the radiation?

Both internal and external

Bearing in mind that I think City United and Chelsea are in the top 3 without a doubt this leaves Tottenham/Everton/Arsenal as rivals for the other spot, most likely the latter.

Its looking more and more likely we will see Bale leave **Tottenham** for Madrid, and even with 80 million or so to spend he is irreplaceable and without his performances they wouldn't have got anywhere near as close to fourth as they did towards the end of last season. Ill be sad to see him leave the premier league but I think this alone would put us in a better position than Tottenham. 

I can’t really see **Everton** being a strong threat for the champions league spot, although they do always perform above their weight. They are a great team all round but I think lack of depth; a change of a long-term manager and probably very few signings will count them out. I’m rather sick of my mates having the last laugh far too often! Also Im very surprised there’s been no bids for Fellaini as of yet, he was linked with Arsenal Chelsea and United throughout the season and I know when I watched the derby he was the player I was most worried about.

This leaves **Arsenal** who are based on previous years are more than likely to be the most difficult to beat for fourth. Their bid for Suarez showed they are willing to spend big and aware of their need to up their game. I think its unlikely Suarez will leave for Arsenal (touch wood) but I just can't see it happening. LFC will know Arsenal is probably the worst team Suarez could go to and they have no reason to sell him to them. Best case scenario here is that they fail to bring in their main targets and are left with fewer options

Regarding our own signings I’m very happy with what we have brought in:

Alberto - not seen much of him but seems like a good prospect
Toure - has held up well in the games I've watched, a great free transfer in my opinion, although I wouldn't rely to heavily on him
Mignolet - I think if it wasnt for all that Reina speculation he would still be here but Mignolet is  a great replacement and seems like hes ready to prove himself at a big club
Aspas - I think the fact hes been given the number 9 shows Rodgers faith. I expect (and hope) to see much less of Stewart Downing and Aspas to be the most used player in this position. Having a decent right-winger was what I wanted to see the most in this transfer window and I think this has been dealt with sufficiently 

Regarding players to bring in –the fact that we were actively bidding for Henrikh shows we may still go in for a big signing. (around 25 mill or less)
Id love Christian Eriksen from what I’ve heard/ seen on videos and think he would be a perfect fit  to our style of play &amp; the speculation seems to suggest this move is possible.

 I honestly don’t think we are in dire need of another centre-back with Toure, Agger, Skrtel, Wisdom and Kelly, although if we did sign Papa/ someone of that caliber we would most likely sell Skrtel.

Players out:
Coates 
Spearing


I read somewhere say before that keeping Suarez would be like a marquee signing and I agree entirely – we cant attract a player of his standard at the moment and I think holding onto him would give us the best possible chance of a return to were we belong.


Summary - another big **proven** attacking/creative player signing. Hold onto Suarez &amp; I think we are good enough to perform better than the 3 rivals - provided the above.

Anyway this is my opinion on our current situation and our rivals with a best-case scenario perspective.

I've been applying for jobs for about 2 months since my A Levels finished and the places have either not got back to me, or have told me I haven't got through the first stage.  

My email address is just [firstname][lastname], so they can't be basing me off that. My facebook and twitter aren't obscene (and facebook is only viewable by friends), and I have an above average amount of GCSEs and other good qualifications.

* Sainsbury's won't hire under 18s and their recruitment thing is bloody confusing - offering a rate of pay for under 18s but then saying [that under 18s can't apply](http://i.imgur.com/HMmXL6B.png).  
* Boots have rejected me (and their website said I can't apply again for 18 months).  
* Sainsbury's won't let me apply on their website for at least 6 months because I applied and didn't get a job.  
* ASDA won't let me apply for 12 months and only said that it was because I was under 18 after I'd applied, so even when I am 18 I won't be able to apply there until June 2014.
* Co-op never got back to me.  
* Smaller shops aren't hiring at the moment, and then there definitely wouldn't be a chance to transferring to where I'll be for uni.  
* Morrisons never appear to be hiring. 
* A lot of bigger supermarkets only want store managers at the moment, or bakers, or full time workers.

  
I've just applied for a job at a Tesco near me, and a few friends started working for Tesco when they were 17, so there's a small chance here.

On the .gov site the only people they're ever looking for appears to be registered nurses and bricklayers, or the job is only a few hours a week but for multiple days and it wouldn't be worth it as the train ticket would take up 90% of the wage.

**Some background:**We're both late 20s. I live in an urban area where his accent will be appreciated but won't make him uncomfortably conspicuous. He'll have unlimited access to public transit as well as a car. There are a number of conveniences within a 5 minute walk of the house, including British imports (beans! McVitie's! Ribena!) that I know will help him feel more at home.

We're not under any financial pressure but he hates the thought of not contributing and is stressed about finding a job ASAP. I realize a social life may follow from his work life, but making friends is another of his concerns.

**The questions:** Has anyone had experiences moving from the UK to the US? I'd love to hear your stories. What advice can you give for him? What can *I* do to ease his transition?

**Bonus question:** What should he do to live it up in the UK before the big move? He's working on a list of people and places to visit (lake district, Isle of Wight, Hadrian's Wall, another trip through the British Museum, etc.). I'll be visiting in September and we'll stay in Kent, so suggestions there are extra-excellent.

Maybe it's been stated somewhere before but a quick google search didn't show me anything. 

What if John Hurt is the last regeneration of the Doctor? And we'll see 10 and 11 work together to eventually kill him to save the universe from his evil doings, dooming their own death as the ultimate sacrifice. edit:(I don't mean 10 and 11 dying there, but having the last regeneration of The Doctor die by his own hands)

All of this is assuming he is evil, and well, if the doctor is strong enough to save the universe countless of times, surely a future regeneration of his is the one who could destroy existance in the most efficient matter.

Regarding the theories that maybe 11 saw John Hurt in the hotel episode could be justified with the fact that the Doctor is a time traveler, and maybe has met John Hurt before when he (JH) went back in time and crossed paths with his previous self. So the secret is not the Doctor's past, but what he knows he'll find himself doing in the future, assuming its a fixed point in time.(maybe by having witnessed JH doing some misdeeds).

I guess a counter argument is the fact that it's rumored (maybe confirmed?) that JH is between 8 and 9 but also [Moffat has stated that he's been lying a lot regarding the 50th. ](http://www.themarysue.com/moffat-doctor-who-lies/)

It seems every news outlet is jumping on this ""Bale to Madrid"" bandwagon just to get page views on their websites, and I'm sick of seeing so many of these baseless rumors being perpetuated by our own fans. It's even more disheartening to see so many of you saying you're ""giving up on Bale"" as if he's already on a flight to Spain.

As far as we know: 
He's happy at the club. At the end of last season he just said he's enjoying his football and he's ready to get us back into the Champions League next season.
AVB said Levy gave his word that we're keeping Bale this summer. 
Paulinho said he chose Spurs partly because he was promised Bale would be here.

It's as simple as this: We miss out on Champions League this season, and Bale probably leaves next summer. Make top 4 and he could stay with us for a while. Until we get some quotes from the man himself, there's no reason to believe otherwise.

Here's why:

- Financial Resources. Even with FFP, we simply cannot compete with the likes of City and Chelsea in terms of cash. We can't dole out cash on any player and simply use wages to get them to Liverpool.

- Stadium and facilities. Anfield only seats 55k. That means that for each home game we sell 35,000 less tickets than a club like United. If we want to have a chance to have sustained excellence at the top of the table we need at least a 65k seater that is a truly world-class facility. Additionally, melwood, in my opinion, is in dire need of significant upgrades with new technologies and an overall newer feel. 

- Location. Liverpool, as far as a city goes that can attract players, does not hold a candle to Paris, London, or even Munich. I think players in this day and age care a lot more about how much ""action"" is going on in the city then simply about the club. 

In a more technical sense, think about it this way. There are only 4 champions league spots. With Man City and Chelsea 's cash and facilities, it seems to me that it would be near impossible for them to fall out of the top 4 in the next 20 years. United is near that level but they are still in a ton of debt from the glazer transaction, but with a 95,000 seat stadium, and the global brand that they have, they will always be near the top. I think Arsenal also looks very good for the future, and I hope and pray that Tottenham fuck up on transfers and move back to midtable where they belong. I really don't fucking like Tottenham. 

What are your thoughts? Are my fears unfounded? Am I simply being pessimistic? Or do we need some absolutely drastic changes on the management level to have a chance to win the PL?

Soldado - 26mill looks done, so that is not included.

20-30 mill on either Lamela, or one of Eriksen, Pjanic, Pastore (Pastore might be slightly more expensive)

15 mill - as good as centre back as we can get our hands on. probably Toby Alderweireld

15 mill - as good a left back as we can get our hands on. (possibly Coentrao)

lets say that is 60 mill spent.

25 mill to go

Anyway, its a valid point. If he doesn't fly tomorrow, I think we all know what that is saying.

&gt; Spurs travel to Monaco for a friendly on Saturday and Bale’s absence could point to a development in the move.

&gt; While it was understandable that Bale would not be risked on the rain-soaked pitches of Hong Kong, where Spurs took part in a Premier League tournament last weekend, a more sinister interpretation would be put on him not being there this time.

&gt; Bale, 24, had a brief meeting with Spurs manager Villas-Boas before undergoing rehab work on the periphery of the main session along with injured stars Lewis Holtby and Younes Kaboul.

&gt; The Welshman has not played in a game since the pre-season friendly against Swindon and had been slated to play in a behind-closed-doors game today.

&gt; However, as mystery continues to surround the exact nature of Bale’s glute injury, that game has been quietly dropped and Spurs players will instead undergo straightforward training sessions today and tomorrow before flying out.

&gt; Madrid are now keen to get going on an £85million deal for the player and are still hoping for some sort of formal request for a transfer from Bale to spark proper negotiations.

&gt; Bale is unwilling to go that far, but his continued lack of availability is almost as frustrating for Spurs, whose season kicks off at Crystal Palace in 18 days’ time.

&gt; Villas-Boas will not want chairman Daniel Levy to play his usual game of brinkmanship as the transfer deadline approaches as any money for Bale would need to be reinvested. Levy is on holiday in Miami but business at the club continues apace with both comings and goings.

Basically, we want to focus on the nice bits and keep away from the sectarian bits (I'm English, the Mrs is from Kerry - it's lose-lose).  Where should we look/avoid around the city?  Where are the pretty/well facilitated bits?  I've been reading about the Creggan and Fountain estates as trouble hot-spots, but I'm having trouble working out where they are on google maps.

Got a few questions regaurding seeing Chelsea Premier League matches. First some background..

I am going back to England in March 2013, and I want to see my Blues play! I will be purchasing the True Blue Membership and there are three matches I want to see :Matches are on March 15, 22 and 29, against Aston Villa (Away), Arsenal (Home), and Chrystal Palace (Away) respectively. I will have no loyalty points accumalated before I go to England and try to see these matches. 

So, in your pasts experiences on average how many loyalty points would one need to secure to insure that a person could see these kinds of games?

I know there are different match types AA, A and B type matches that reward different points for going, but is there a requirement to see these matches? 

Does anyone have any experience with the Viagogo match selling vendor? 


Any information or personal anecdotes are greatly appreciated!

I can't wait to go back to the homeland after 4 years of living here in the States, on my trip I am going to see Old Trafford, The Emirates, Anfield, Loftus Road, The Ethiad and Wembley. Touring the stadiums, soaking up the footballing history, but I HAVE to see my Blues at least twice while I am there!!!

Next year there is a possibility Real lose cristiano to another giant, maybe united. They'll need bale more than ever at that point, they'll want a new face for the club. If bale has at least a repeat season real will be willing to pay far more, dare i say 125? Plus CL money we could really strengthen the squad at that point and put a lot towards the stadium. i just read a figure that said 20 mil in revenue is estimated for CL. Im being optimistic I know but i could see it happening. What do you all think?

The reason I stopped fishing was because I don't want to have to put my fish back into the lake again. Nor do I want to have to pay for the fish I rightfully caught. It defies the purpose, I might aswell get some fish from tesco if I need to pay for it.

Anyhoo, I'm here to ask if anyone knows any decent spots near Liverpool (or generally in the north west) that I can freely fish? The closer to Liverpool the better but I'm happy to consider further spots.

I just want to be able to go to a lake and catch 1-3 decent fish with friends and take them back every couple weeks or so, I don't need to strip fish a lake and I don't want to have to pay even more money than the fishing gear/fuel costs/licencing costs that are already making it not seem worth it.

With google, all I can find are threads complaining about the situation but no useful info that I'm trying to find. Perhaps my googling skills are failing me or perhaps our fishing laws really are so bad that there is no info to relay.

I'm sure there are random unprohibited natural lakes about I can easily fish from and I'm sure the law isn't so lame in every official fishing lake in the country. I'm hoping that anyone can give me any first hand wisdom.

I've been on a bit of a journey lately. Not a fun one either.

For the last 4 years I've lived and studied in the UK. I just completed my PGCE in secondary English, I'm now certified to teach in the UK! Hooray! In February I was offered a job, signed a contract, everything seemed to be going great!

Then as I'm getting ready to return to the US to apply for my visa, I notify the school that I've yet to receive some of the information I need to do so. They seem confused, say they have to look into it. Week later, I have a letter telling me they've withdrawn the job offer. SOZ! 

So here I am, in the US, feeling desperate. It's not a great time for teaching positions. Then, the more I find out, the more scared I am.

A job needs to advertise for 28 days before they can hire me?
I need to be the best candidate and they have to prove I was better than a UK or EU citizen? 
The job needs a license to sponsor me, which not all schools have?

I'm not even in the UK to interview, which everyone seems to ignore despite my cover letter/phone/address being provided. I've been short listed twice already, but then told nevermind when I remind them that I can't interview in person right now.


Can anyone provide me with advice or information? 
How impossible will it really be for me to get a work visa for the UK?
I've read on the UK embassy site they're only granting 20,700 visas to foreign nationals from April 2013-2014. That seems like incredibly bad odds, I imagine a LOT of claims get denied...

Any advice avenues I can find are UK based, and while I've tried citizens advice bureau I end up hitting walls every which way.

What can I do? What should I do?


I'll be vacationing and staying with friends for September/October and hopefully will try to find some interviews in this time period as well, but I get an overwhelming feeling of hopelessness when I list up all of the hoops to jump through.

School starts Sept 9.

I just sort of have a list of questions so if anyone can answer any, that'd be great.

Given this time constraint, is it even possible to get a visa? (I guess this question is more for the foreigners in the thread)

I was looking at matriculation on the website, but didn't see how paying for tuition works. Do I pay the whole thing all at once? Does the school need proof that you actually have the money before you go?

Is it normal to defer acceptances? If possible, this is what I want to do, because it's a huge rush for me to get everything ready by the end of the month, and I'm not even sure if I'll be able to do it (especially in the case of getting a visa since how quickly that gets processed is completely out of my hands). Should I write to the program director or to the head of the school for this?

That's all I can think of at the moment. I'm actually kind of panicked right now because I was already resigned to not going to grad school due to delays from my home university and now I've been thrown for a loop, with less than 30 days to get everything in order.

That being said, I want to try and have an open discussion on the [increasingly possible sale of Gareth Bale to Real Madrid](http://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/jul/31/tottenham-gareth-bale-alvaro-morata). 

As Spurs are another London team and have increasingly shown their ability to challenge for a top four spot and Champions league football (albeit the latter endeavour has been unsuccessful) from a strategic perspective I would think it's important to look at the broader implications the sale of Bale may have on the season for not just Spurs but the other Premier League teams, and more specifically teams in contention for CL football and the league title itself.

To get to the point there are a few main points of discussion I'd like to get people's opinions on (I'm looking at you Icanhazcomment, EnglishMD...).

That being said, points to consider...

1. If a transfer of £86m after all is said and done how much cash in hand are Spurs likely to have?

2. Spurs have already spent close to £50m on transfers this summer (Soldado, Chadli, Paulinho) with the sale of Bale are they likely to spend more in this window?

3. Would the influx of funds from selling Bale give Spurs more clout in the transfer market and the ability to make bigger name signings?

4. What impact would Bale leaving have on the team?

5. Could Bale be easily replaced through spending? Napoli sold Cavani and brought in Higuain, an expensive signing possibly financed by Cavani's sale, in what seems like a measure to fill a void in the forward position. Are there viable options on the table to replace Bale, or are most wingers of Bale's caliber tied up at better clubs?

6. Taking possible transfers after a Bale sale into account, would Spurs perform similarly without Bale? What impact could this have on the top four clubs, title race, and CL spots?

If there are any points I'm not considering please voice them. I'll do my best to add them to the topic so that newer people to the thread can read them.

I realize this discussion isn't Chelsea-centric but it does involve our club to some extent. Bale effectively made Spurs work last season, he was their  game winning player in a lot of situations. Losing him could be devastating, but it could also make them stronger vis-a-vis transfers. 

I had considered posting this to /r/soccer but discussion there tends to devolve into trash pretty quickly. I figured this would be a good environment to get the ball rolling.

I'd really like to hear what people think, new fans and especially people who have been following the First Division and Premier League for a long time.

Thanks in advance, looking forward to reading some replies.

**Edit:** [From Jayesar (Spurs Fan) with regards to possible Bale revenue and existing wages, as well as prospective targets that may replace Bale](http://www.reddit.com/r/chelseafc/comments/1jii44/discussion_possible_sale_of_gareth_bale_and/cbf2awq):

&gt; Gallas and Bentley have been released freeing up quite a bit of wage space (100k+). That amount is surprising, but remember Gallas was free which typically means bigger wages and Bentley was spurs x-fer record. Soldado is rumoured 60k, Paulinho will be less than that and Chadli less again. Some fringe players like Dempsey/Huddlestone/Livermore/Parker/Gomes will probably be shifted this window freeing up more wage space.

&gt; Bale is probably going and interestingly enough named targets: Mata, Hulk, Lamela. I don't think those are realistic (obviously we aren't getting Mata), but that gives you an idea where AVB is looking. Lamela is probably the most likely 1:1 replacement.",false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,null,null,self,Discussion: Possible sale of Gareth Bale and broader impact on the season,22,http://www.reddit.com/r/chelseafc/comments/1jii44/discussion_possible_sale_of_gareth_bale_and/

______________________________________________________________________________________________

Liverpool is my second favorite club at the end of the day behind Atletico Madrid, and I can tell you all one thing for sure, Diego Costa at the moment is turning into one of the most deadly strikers in Europe.

During the start of the 2011/12 season, I would probably agree with a lot of you saying he's just alright and wouldn't probably ever cut it in the PL. But under Simeones' tenure, Costa has been transformed into the striker majority of Atletico fans wanted him to be when we bought him from Vallaloid in 2010. After a very successful loan spell with Rayo Vallecano in the 2011/12 season where he scored 10 goals and gave 4 assists in only 16 matches, Simeone knew at the very start of his time at Atleti that this young Brazilian was going to have a shout in his team.

Very technical, good on the dribble, wonderful pace, good strength, and having quite the eye for goal made Costa our first choice striker for the better half of the 12/13 season when Falcaos' form started to dip combined with a few injuries keeping him out of the first team. Costa can play on the wings quite proficiently, slowly but surely though he has made that CF position all his own. He was an integral part of our Copa Del Ray win this year over Real Madrid, notching 7 goals and 2 assists en route to the final as well as scoring in the final itself. Overall throughout the season, in which he was only a starter for the second half, he scored 20 goals and gave 15 assists.

Diego Costa only received this reputation of being a ""hot head"" in the last year. He has been very misunderstood, and the hivemind in /r/soccer just kind of took off after the first RM v Atleti derby match of the 12/13 season when Costa was locking horns with Ramos all game. People can say what they will about him, but Costa is a very self aware professional and came out in an interview earlier this year saying that he is a ""provocateur"" and that is how Diego Simeone wanted him to play. Drawing the fouls, getting the opposition all riled up so that they would be more prone to make mistakes. He's quite the intelligent footballer for only being 24 years old.

[Here's](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvll_n4wWDs) a video of his exploits from this last season. And [another](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zCXIIfpjTK4&amp;feature=youtu.be). To me, he would be quite the pick up for Pool. As well, depending on how he does this season, he might be more realistic of a target for Pool in the January window, or even next summer. From what I've seen so far in our three friendly matches this summer, Costa isn't looking a shadow of his former self, he's looking twice the player he was last season and all of us at Atletico have very high hopes for him. He was by far the best player this season for Atletico Madrid, sure maybe didn't score as many goals as Falcao, but he did a lot more for the team in addition to 20 goals and 15 assists he gave this season.

**TL;DR He's definitely misunderstood, and a bit of a diamond in the rough. Would be a fantastic addition to Liverpool's top 4 ambitions as he has all the makings of a top class striker/winger in years to come.**",false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,null,null,self,Some insight into Diego Costa from someone who watched him all season long.,183,http://www.reddit.com/r/LiverpoolFC/comments/1jipmy/some_insight_into_diego_costa_from_someone_who/

1. Would anyone have a notion where I could pick up a pup for free? We have a baby due next month and we think that if we had a pup then our older dog wouldn't feel less neglected when the baby comes along and has a little friend to keep her company. Any dog I've ever had has been rescued from the pound, not that I'm cheap.. Just would rather save a dog who would soon be put down. There are a few younger dogs knocking about on Gumtree and Facebook but they're all ""Wud luv dis dog da hav a gud home as we don't av tym 4 it, gud home onli... £80"". What the fuck? Need a dog rehomed but want to make a few quid off it's back.. Idiots! Yeah, so if anyone could point in the right direction it would be awesome.

2. Well, so I've mentioned.. Baby next month. We obviously can't travel about right now due to it being late on but we're wondering if anyone would have a caravan in Newcastle or thereabouts that they'd let for a weekend for a few quid or even better.. FREE! It would be nice just to have a few days away from all the stress and just relax. Funds are obviously extremely tight due to babies costly a fortune (our first) but if I could get somewhere for 2 days, we could try £20 worth of Asda tat in the car and head off.

After the advert had finished its run, a few days later I got an email from someone via a music website asking if it was still for sale. It was, and he said he wanted to buy it and would cover shipping costs as he had a few other things in the UK he was shipping.  

He asked for my name, address, and phone number and said he'd send me a cheque. I got it this morning and the cheque was for €1200. I emailed him to ask if this was right, and he said yes because he was shipping other things with the guitar. I thought it was way too much as soon as I saw the cheque but then again, I don't know what else he's shipping. 

Then he told me to cash the cheque today (which I couldn't do because I got the email after the bank closed) and in the email he [was adamant that this should be done today](http://i.imgur.com/9V5Tr5q.png).  
The only person with the name he gave me I could find was in Malaysia, but the address he gave me was in Paris and it looked like an old shop on Google Maps.

I emailed back telling him I can't do money transfer via Western Union as I don't have ID or a credit card, and WU only allows transfers of £400 a time. I've heard a few times that WU is used by scammers a lot, but I don't really know. The other emails don't read well (like a stereotypical scammer), but that might just be because English isn't his first language.

I'm conflicted, because I do need the money but at the same time this is far more effort than I thought it'd be and I would have probably been able to find another buyer if he'd initially told me that I'd have to transfer money as I could have said no straight away.",false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,null,null,self,Is this a scam?,3,http://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/1jivzq/is_this_a_scam/

Welcome back to Picture of the Month, where we showcase some Welsh photos and culture. Here's the plan:

Using the comments section below, submit your photos for Picture of the Month. The photo must be your own work and be your best or favourite representation of Wales and Welsh Culture.

The photo with the most upvotes by **midnight August 7th** gets featured on the sidebar (where you can see [last month's winning submission](http://www.reddit.com/r/Wales/comments/1hgh2l/contest_picture_of_the_month_june/cax6y3m) by /u/buddamus), until it's time for next month's, in which it will be added to the list of Pictures of the Month to come in the upcoming wikilist shindig.

The submitter also gets **a month of reddit Gold**. La di da.

So let's get into the rules:

* No theme this month
* Photo submissions must be the root comment in any given comment thread
* It must be your photo. No pilfering photography sites
* It must be 'appropriate'. No hi-res genitalia please.
* It must be at least 300x200 pixels, but the higher the resolution the better! I mean, within reason of course.
* Captions are welcome and encouraged, as they will be included in the 'about' section
* Please be kind and courteous of other users' submissions
* Use your upvotes wisely! The most upvoted submission will most probably be the one we choose, though this is at the discretion of the mods.
* Don't be nasty and downvote images just 'cause they're not yours. That's totally not cool
* This contest will have nothing to do with the upcoming header image photos, more info to come...
* If you suspect foul play feel free to message the moderators!

Changes from last month's competition:

* No theme this time, ain't nobody got time fo' dat

That about sums it up. Please upvote for visibility, we get no karmas for any of this self post shenanigans. We look forward to seeing your submissions, Good luck!

I doubt there's anything to it and would rather keep Clintu at Spurs, but...anyone hear anything?

*Edit: Seems that the guy who posted the twitter photo of Dempsey in SFO saying that he was boarding a flight to Seattle later tweeted that Dempsey went to another gate.  Would make more sense that he was flying to LA to meet with Everton, and perhaps was in SF to watch Everton play Juventus last night, or just connected through SFO to LA.  Though...that also makes little sense because Everton are heading back to England by Monday, I believe, so why make the flight to the States for Everton?

Andrew Haigh (the Sun) says that [these are currently the only two offers made for Leeds players.](https://twitter.com/AndrewHaigh/status/363076148634587136)

In my opinion these offers are way too low. I don't want to see either leave but seriously, they're worth way more than that, but we need to sell to bring in.

One could argue we have too many lb's (Warnock, White, Drury,Pugh and I'm pretty sure Pearce can play there but I wouldn't think we'd need to test that) but I still believe White will have another role in the team.

Unless we sign someone massive I'd be pissed to see either go.

reason i say this is because a handful of them are scary because of their ability to hide, their speed and what happens when they get you (plus, telling someone not to blink makes everyone's eyes itch, it's ingeniously cruel :P ).  THEN we get the one with Matt Smith, and the Time of Angels and they get all these other powers out of nowhere which kinda destroyed a lot of the mystery, and there were hundreds of them which is scary because they outnumber you defeating the purpose.

well, about me:

I've played dota since just before MEdusa patch, ~6 months. played just over 900 matches and finally gotten above 50% win rate (it'll go down after I try out a new hero position)

I play mainly supports when playing seriously(with the ppl who taught me Dota) but recently I've experimented with mids.

I've pretty much been streaming since i picked the game up

http://www.twitch.tv/ambacelar

I'm streaming right now tbh, dunno for how much longer.

Just looking for a few ppl who can critique to help me improve.

With the announced statement from [BBC](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-23398212) 

&gt; The episodes will also see the return of the Daleks and the Zygons 

I'm not enthusiastic. I want better writing, or more characters, more subtle foreshadowing and an actual good climax to the series. AKA Bad Wolf. 
I was pretty excited to see where the River Song foreshadowing and etc would go but was so disappointed at every turn.

I want new ""angels"" - that episode had me terrified but since then it has become overused to the point of non understanding and I lack that chill within me. The flawless idea became flawed - Huge Angel in New York moving without people seeing? yeah okay.

And the assistants. God.

Clara, whilst so hot, is as useful as a marzipan dildo. She can act, ^I ^know ^it ^^I ^^want ^^to ^^believe. 

However, she's been given cheesy lines and the whole thing about the impossible girl, which was interesting but then just anticlimatic at the end... 


The are some subtleties now and again which are pretty good though. The doctor's face when he's trying to not show he's attracted to Clara. Brilliant.  But the fact that he's married to River - WTF. It ruins everything romantic.

I think it **is** the right time for Matt to leave just because he can't act serious at all, and whilst it is nice to have someone fun, I want some more genuine melancholy in the Doctor and some believable seriousness like with Tennant and Ecclestone (who despite popular opinion, I really enjoyed as the Doctor).

**TL;DR**  I hope that next series; a series with a new doctor will turn the show good again- by featuring a bit more seriousness and more genuine original (scary) characters.

Accordingly, he has proposed giving me an additional £30k, but on the proviso that I pay him monthly installments until his death, in the form of compound interest, to a value around that which he would get from the bonds minus tax.

Fracking.  Porn filter.  Spare room tax.  Incapacity benefit ""reviews"".  Jobseeker victimisation.  Assaults on the NHS as a precursor to privatisation.  These are just some of the attacks our elected government has inflicted on us a a people, just the ones I could think of in the last two minutes.

What do we do about it?  Certainly, nobody is happy with the current state of affairs, but protest is conspicuously absent.  Let's change that.

With almost 60k subscribers from all around the country, this community is in an unrivaled position to organise and popularise a national protest movement.  In response to the many assaults the political and financial elite have made on us, I propose a multi-pronged assault focusing on the only thing which matters to them - money.

Protest, while a good thing, is ignored.  This was proved in the run-up to the invasion of Iraq, when (as some estimated) up to two million people marched in London.  We all know how that turned out.  As such, while I suggest a national protest in,say, late August, I think this should be mainly a symbolic gesture, to go hand in hand with more aggressive measures.

When French farmers are aggrieved, they block the highways and byways of the capital with their tractors, and dump lorry-loads of shit outside government offices.  I think we could learn from this.  Think how many millions (billions?) would be lost if the financial heart of London were inaccessible for even one day.

While not wanting to suggest anyone break the law (for the very obvious reason that I would be immediately picked up by our nascent Stasi), I would suggest people take a look at the tactics used by the Suffragettes.  A few thousand shattered windows in the heart of London (or, indeed, nationwide) would speak volumes.

I also think that graffiti has its place in protest, as not only does it conveniently turn any vertical surface into a billboard for our grievances, it also costs money to remove.  Again, I believe this is the only way we can change anything - by hitting them in the wallet.

As stated by another user in another post, a nationwide strike would bring them begging.

I would like to start an honest debate on the subject here, so please give your input, whether you think this is right or wrong.  If you have any suggestions, a better way to go about things, please contribute.  Maybe we should start our own sub, idk.  I just know something has to be done, and I'm reaching out to the only community I have.

EDIT:  So much apathy.  So much negativity.  So little hope of actually making a difference.  Well, I'll keep trying.  For anyone who's interested, /u/CrashingAnalyst informed me of a movement that shares many of these concerns - the [Coalition of Resistance](http://www.coalitionofresistance.org.uk/).  I also think that the [Pirate Party](https://www.pirateparty.org.uk/) are our best hope of meaningful political reform (outside of UKIP ofc, but that would be moving in the wrong direction entirely).

Thank you for reading.

In saying that, below is my argument for holding onto him. The assumption I run with is that the transfer window closes tomorrow - it just simplifies discussions, we could talk all day about 'what if team X brought player Y', let's just deal with what we know and not speculation.

Stadium naming rights are probably the single most important thing for spurs right now, whilst a season in the CL may generate £30m+ pounds and attract a fancy player or two, naming rights will generate £150m worth of cash and move the club from having to find players in the bargain bin to being able to attract and afford class players. How will spurs land these naming rights? Via marketability. The club needs to be a worthwhile sponsor for whomever comes in (rumoured BT or Qatar airways). What type of thing would a potential sponsor look for? A club that has maximum media exposure.

I believe spurs with Bale, have a far higher chance at landing stadium naming rights (and thus generating £150m) due to Bale's popularity. The guy is on billboards, game covers, every TV channel and is signed on as a BT pundit next season. He has twice as many twitter followers as spurs official and has occupied headlines since January. He is quickly becoming the Tottenhams CR7. Furthermore, with Bale spurs have a far higher chance of landing CL football which means far more club exposure. If the x-fer window ended tomorrow I would be very confident in pipping Arsenal to 4th place because the signings of Chadli/Paulinho/Soldado will be worth more than 1 point over the course of the season. Spurs earnt the third highest amount of cash ast season from live TV cash due to the fact that they were shown so much, people are tuning in to watch spurs, this is a huge draw card for a naming rights sponsor.

In the best case scenario, spurs hang onto Bale for a season generating more fans and merchandise funds, get CL football providing an improved platform for bringing in replacements and also giving £30m worth of cash and spurs land a stadium name worth £150m. Well, in the best case scenario spurs stand to make up to £200m off of the back of Bale. The club motto is to dare is to do right?

Even in the worst case scenario, spurs miss CL football, don't get naming rights and look like they will have to sell Bale, how is that any different to the current situtation now?

I think I had a dodgy pint...

So at last, competitive football (and football at the Liberty in general) is back! Having finally got back onto the season ticket scheme, I took my now-to-be regular seat in the East Upper, and met a nice bloke who I found out will be joining me all season. He seems to know his football!

Onto the match: I don't think there's really much to be said with this game. Nobody would say we didn't deserve the final score, and keeping a clean sheet in European football is just as valuable as scoring. One goal in the second leg from us and it's practically a done deal.

As expected, Jonjo Shelvey looked impressive. His long range ball is superb (although he needs to work on his short passing at times - sometimes it seems he can be flustered into a poor sideways pass that is easy to intercept). Not only were his forward balls incisive, but off the ball his workrate is fantastic, and you don't see his shoulders drop if he gives away possession.

Bony had the perfect debut, with two goals and an assist. I haven't got much else to say really, other than that I already think he'll be a success.
 
Amat looked solid. I usually find that the less you talk about a centreback, the better they've played. I've got pretty much nothing to say about his performance, other than the yellow seemed a bit harsh. I don't think Malmö threatened enough to give a strong evaluation of him yet.

Pozuelo looked good, and his goal was absolutely fantastic, but only being on the pitch a short amount of time, I find it difficult to comment further on him. Starting a game will be much different to coming on late in the game, so I'll save full judgement until then (although if he wants to keep coming on late and scoring, that's fine too).

And finally, Cañas. I've not been sure how to spell his name since he arrived, seeing as the club have just used 'Canas' on their website, but seeing his shirt last night I finally know! Only ten minutes on the pitch from him. He looks reliable, and definitely looks like a solid anchor for the midfield. Like Pozuelo, I can't say much after such a short spell. That being said, I could see Cañas and Shelvey linking up together nicely, Cañas giving Shelvey the space he needs to make those fantastic diagonal balls.

I was a bit surprised with the attendance (16,200ish), because qualification is no certainty, and people are going to be very sore if we don't qualify and they missed our only European games! That being said, the atmosphere in my corner was fantastic, and I have a lot of respect for the travelling Swedish fans who made the trip, and were in fantastic voice.

I've had time this morning to skim through the game I recorded from ITV4. Surprisingly (given how bad Pro Evo always was for commentary!) I found John Champion and Clarke Carlisle to be a fantastic commentary team, with the right amount of humour but also some fantastic analysis. They interact well together, and they had a good knowledge of our club other than the usual clichés that have formed around us since we got to the top flight.

I look forward to your comments! I'd like to make this a regular thing, but I'm going to need all of you to interact with me to keep me motivated!",false,swanseacity,t5_2tip4,null,null,self,Match Report: Swansea City 4:0 Malmö FF,6,http://www.reddit.com/r/swanseacity/comments/1jk2qx/match_report_swansea_city_40_malmö_ff/

**General Covering Letter**

A recent university graduate in Civil Engineering, specialised after succeeding an initial two-years of General Engineering, I have a strong background in applied mathematics and logic, and am looking to progress within this environment. In my free time I am currently utilising MATLAB while exploring the applications of genetic algorithms to image processing techniques, having maintained contact with a Computer Science lecturer of Durham University who has agreed to guide me in an intern-type association. My career objective is to gain experience in computer science and programming practices so that I may eventually become an expert in the field.


 During my degree’s final year project, I also applied the versatile genetic algorithms to the modelling and optimisation of steel space-framed concourse roof structures. Certain applications have shown genetic algorithms to outperform more widely used search techniques such as Mont Carlo and hill climbing, especially where the unknown solution space might contain multiple local optima. I welcome the opportunity to develop a broad new range of skills in unfamiliar territories within a team environment. As shown by the self-learning of fundamentals in image processing, I absorb logical concepts quickly, and look forward to creatively applying my growing experience to novel scenarios.


**[Please see my general CV/Resume attached](https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B2rqcCqvoPR5N1BVWWpwSkFiX0E/edit?usp=sharing)**.

**Three teams to be relegated:**

The prediction league can be joined by anyone at any time, but you're probably in with a better chance of winning the earlier you join!

I'm sure we know how this works by now, but for anyone not familiar the rules are very simple:



- A correct guess of the result gets you one point.



- A correct guess of the scoreline gets you three points.


- All guesses must be entered 5 mins before kick off (leniency may be applied, if you ask nicely).


- No editing of posts. If your prediction post is edited, it will not be counted.

In fact, the same as Tottenham decided to reinvest the money received from the sale of Welsh: in fact, like the Romanists Erik Lamela and Miralem Pjanic . 50 million on the table to bring Sabatini in Britain, too few for Roma's senior management, which at most would begin to reflect on the base of 10 million more. The Bosnian is finished also in the sights of London Arsenal cousins, but in case of farewell from Rome will almost certainly Tottenham.

Anyway, as some of ye may have seen  I've updated the side bar a little to add in two new features: A league table, and a list of fixtures.

Since I didn't really want to make the sidebar too crowded I only made a league table with our position, and those clubs around us.

For the fixtures I decided that whenever we have a match thread that it be added to that section so people can easily get back to the match thread, or catch up on the awesomness of previous threads.

Thirdly I was just wondering if it'd be a decent idea to have other items in the sub reddit aswel, such as top scorers and all that jazz. might make just to spruce up the sub reddit a little bit.

Also another point.

With regards to match threads I'm sure a lot of ye know I'm very fond of doing them, and have no problem doing any of them, but don't let me get in your way if you want  do a match thread yourself. I have no problem relinquishing the duty to anyone who wants to do them, but best state it in advance.

""Yeah, I just got a bit carried away"".

I've been thinking about this expression. It's one that's heard with such regularity in the UK you don't even question it. The thing is, the words theselves, when deconstructed - they describe a far huger and more sympathetic response than the idiom represents.

To explain a literal act of being 'carried away' is a submission to a greater force, being powerless in your actions because you were literally guided by some higher energy.

It's funny to think of that everytime you use the phrase ""I got carried away"".

""I was at the pick'n'mix and I got a bit carried away""...

""I had a glass of wine after work, and I was a little bit carried away""....

""Oh she was just in a bad mood and speaking at the meeting and she just got a bit carried away""...

Funny innit?

I know the hive mind, and I know the general opinions on the hottest subjects here.

I'm writing to you all because of the confrontations between us and r/gunners, whom I also visit on a semi regular basis. Here is my view:

Both subreddits are full of subscribers that call each other delusional. I am not innocent from these types of accusations myself. The more I read from each subreddit, the more I realize that once your break through the surfaces, we are pretty much mirror images of each other. We both have a minority that spews nonsense, and we both have a hivemind mentality that generously upvotes comments in favor of the hive mind. The fact of the matter is, is that we both have rational reasons as to why we believe Suarez is staying or going, and we both have personal agendas on what we hope the outcome to be. Now, we all need to take a good look at each other in the eyes, and agree that no subreddit is better then the other, but rather each is just as bad as the other. Neither subreddit is full of blameless saints. 

In the end, supporters will always have their personal opinions, and this should be a safe place to share them. It is now the responsibility of each subreddit to discern what is rational and contributes positively, and what does not.

That being said, carry on, you delusional fans.

However, I have to ask if its possible to win this.

Let us consider what we know.

We know that 1: This is a personal proposition by David Cameron himself as Prime Minister. It is not a legislative act and will therefore not be debated in Parliament unless certain criteria are met, such as it being chosen for debate from the HM Government petition site after reaching 100,000 signatures. 

We know that 2: Nick Clegg, David Davis, Boris Johnson, Ed Miliband, Ed Balls, and other leading or prominant MPs have been strangely silent about this. One could speculate that they are aware of the system's technological and moral faults, and are merely refusing to give Cameron a target to fire at in defence of them, and are instead letting him and Clair Perry bungle around like Punch and Judy as their plans are gradually exposed as what they are -indefensible hogwash- and letting them fall apart under their own mealy-mouthed non-justifications. This is purely speculation, however, and silence is deafening.

We know that 3: The filters as of recently became ""mandatory."" for ISPs. Presumably this means that if ISPs refuse to impliment the blocks then Cameron will push for legislation, which will force the above named to show their hand.

We know that 4: The filters are backed by at least one major newspaper and one ISP (Daily Mail and TalkTalk respectively) and that at least one major newspaper and one ISP opposes the filters (The Guardian and Andrews&amp;Arnold LTD Respectively)

We know that, 5, the filters will extentd to a number of at best questionable subjects that a democratically elected government should not be seeking to limit people's knowledge of.

Lastly, we know that, 6, despite being the molehill to the filter's mountain, the recently semi-controversy of Lads Mags covering themselves up has gone totally ignored by the Government.

My question is this. Does this not seem like one of those things that the Government is going to end up doing or, at the very least, tolerating purely because it can?

I am not suggesting that we do not oppose and fight this. Not one bit.

However, Cameron is not a gracious loser. Whatever comes after the filters, and I am certain that there will always be something else to add, will no doubt be far worse if the filters are implimented. However, I am worried that Call Me Dave might decide to push this through without involving Parliament at all, and if we show the kind of opposition that Miliband, Balls, Johnson and other MPs can't ignore then he'll come up with something worse until he gets his way.

Thoughts, ideas, guidance, comments written on paper aeroplanes. I request and welcome them.


EDIT. I am not asking if its possible for individual people to bypass the filters. I'm talking about whether or not it'd be possible for them to never be put into action in the first place across the entire nation.

However, we later learn that when the Time Lords weren't time locked, travel between universes and dimensions was possible.

A thought occurred to me that I don't recall ever being addressed, though I could be wrong. In the parallel universe we had alternate versions of people, i.e. Mickey/Ricky. Is it possible there are alternate versions of the Doctor?

My first thought past this realization is no, there isn't an alternate version. This is because he is a Time Lord and could travel through universes and dimensions at one time, making his existence omnipresent in all universes and dimensions. However, since I don't recall this ever being discussed in the show, it is still within the realm of possibility that the Doctor can exist in different forms in different universes and dimensions. This of course led to millions of musing, like the possibility of the Doctor's regenerations creating different Doctors than the ones we know. The 11th Doctor in an alternate universe could be Anthony Hopkins, for all we know.

I just wanted to know if this was ever discussed in any media and if it is known in the canon.

Disclaimer from the top: He knows NOTHING about whether or not bids have been made/hes never met Bale. 

But he spoke to me for a while about interesting considerations that the accounting department makes when participating in transfer discussions. They write transfer contingency reports for players and a key element of the memos written about Bale's potential transfer is the need for a full upfront payment, not one based on installments or debt from a Spanish bank, as the clubs accountants are wary about long term validity of any potential monetary loans from Spanish banks.

I thought this was a really interesting point especially given the recent debate about whether or not we would be better off with 80+ million pounds, or some type of player exchange or just keeping Bale. Maybe player exchanges are more attractive if we can't get the money all up front.

Between the ages of 5 and 17, it is legally permissible for children to drink alcohol at home or at a friend's house with the permission of a parent or legal guardian.[91]

The minimum age for the purchase of alcohol is 18. People aged 16 or 17 may consume wine, beer or cider on licensed premises when ordered with a meal.[1] In England and Wales, it must be an adult who orders;[92] however, an adult doesn't have to be present to order alcohol with a meal in Scotland. The legal age for the purchase of alcohol from an off-licence (store/supermarket) is 18. (The legal age to buy liqueur chocolates is 16, but this is rarely enforced.)

Under the BBPA's Challenge 21 scheme, customers attempting to buy alcoholic beverages are asked to prove their age if in the retailer's opinion they look under 21 even though the law states they must be a minimum of 18. Many supermarket and off-licence chains display Challenge 21 notices stating that they will not serve persons who look under 21 without ID.

Supermarkets or off-licence chains that are found to have violated the law and have repeatedly sold alcohol to underage persons are then required to adopt the Challenge 25 scheme. Failing to adhere to this will result in revocation of the licence to sell alcohol. (Challenge 25 is standard procedure in Scotland and the main supermarket chains.)
Purchasing alcohol on behalf of a minor is illegal in all of the United Kingdom. This means acting as the young person's agent.[93][94]",false,INGLIN,t5_2v1ve,null,null,self,This is why we can handle our drinks in Inglin!,6,http://www.reddit.com/r/INGLIN/comments/1jlmsa/this_is_why_we_can_handle_our_drinks_in_inglin/

Below I flesh out the argument for selling Bale.  I'm not advocating for either position; I'm just showing there is another side.   
   
1. **If Bale wants to leave, we should let him go.**  He has been an immense player for us and a great sportsman on and off the pitch. I don't see why we should shackle him down if he wants to move on.   Holding on to players the way we did with Modric is discouraging for other players who consider playing for us. 
  
2. **Spurs demonstrated to be a top side without Bale's brilliance.**  Bale is our best player, true.  But not by as much as the media will let you believe. Our team is full of top talent, that would command first team spots in any team in PL.  With the likes of Vertonghen, Lloris, Dembele, Sandro, Lennon, and Walker we have shown that we can be a top-4 side even when Bale is suspended or simply not performing at his best.  Remember, in our best season when we played in the CL recently, Bale was contributing much less.  True, we had Modric, but Paulinho and Dembele are not that far off in terms of midfield talent.  
3. **Bale's departure is inevitable.**  You may disagree with this point, but Bale stated before, several times too, that he would leave to the Barca/RM.  If it's not going to happen this season, it will the next.  And it would be very hard for Bale to replicate this season's individual success.  
4. **Club attitude in the transfer market does not make us great; it's the results on the pitch that do.** Who cares that RM are dicks? Doesn't change the facts.  They bought Ronaldo from Man U also, and it was a good bit of business for both clubs.  Tottenham will not remain a top-tier club by being a stickler, but by producing results.  Win a trophy or two or get to CL semis, and then it doesn't matter how cocky Madrid are. 
5. **Bale's departure might actually be good for team chemistry.** Bale has been highlighted as the absolute star for Spurs the past season, overshadowing the rest of the team by a mile.  The fact is that Sandro, Veronghen, Lloris, and the rest of the team have put in quite a few phenomenal performances.   
6. **Yes, 96m GBP is a ton of cash.** We can do a lot with it, and it relieves the financial situation a bit.  We just spent 26m on a striker (!!).  Obviously our financial approach is changing.

Gareth Bale being sold to RM will set this club back for years to come, regardless of the money we receive and here is why. 

As a fan I want my team to win trophies every year, I want our players to be the best in the world, and our youth products to be the next big thing.  We are building something special the way United did with SAF, and Woolwich did with Arsen. We have the next face of the sport, dressed in Lilly White. We have what United had with Beckham. A player that regardless of what shirt he put on, will always be associated with United. A player that represents the sport world wide. 

With the new TV deal in the US for the BPL, and the growth of the Asian market, keeping Bale is more than just about the money, but about the brand. Spurs have a chance to have an iconic player be associated with them, something that very few clubs can boast of. Think about it, what shirt do you remember Henry in, Barca or arsenal? Beckham? Zhidan? Ronaldhino? My point is that this is a critical time for both Bale and Tottenham, where both are near a peak, Bale is about to go in to his most productive years as a professional footballer, and Spurs are at the cusp of becoming a world wide brand. Its time for this club to stand up and tell RM to fuck off, we don't need to sell our best players, no matter the size if the offer, because if we are to compete and win trophies, than we must have the best players, and it has to start here and now. 

I will support this club no matter the outcome , but we now have a chance to truly become more than a club, more than a team, and to become a true brand. If we are to dare to be the greatest club in the world, then we must do it now,""Audere est Facere"" to dare is to do.

I've been playing soccer/real football since age 4 (36 now).  I coach a fairly successful high school team.  I love football and have been following Spurs for a few years, but televised games here are sometimes few and far between.  NBC will be correcting that this season, about which I am very excited.

Anyway, I was wondering if going to a game at WHL (or any Spurs match, or even any EPL match) is considered a special occasion, so to speak.

I have two reference points for comparison: I live in Ohio, about 90 minutes' drive from Cincinnati, where the Reds play baseball.  Now, I realize American baseball teams play more games than EPL matches, and they're usually televised on regional channels, but to go to a Reds game is normally a source of amusement or entertainment, but nothing more.  In other words, I'll say to the Mrs., ""Hey, want to go to a Reds game this weekend?""  And she might say, ""Sure, sounds like fun.  We'll take the kids.""

By contrast, I graduated from The Ohio State University, where American football is a huge deal.  As a student, even though I've never played a minute of American football in my life, I never missed a home game.  As an alum, I usually go to one game per season, and I'm lucky to get tickets, at that, and never more than two that are seated together.  I'll fully admit I don't even understand the nuances of the game, but I get caught up in the history and the pageantry and the celebration with other fans.  It's an experience that reminds me of watching Spurs games as I perceive them on TV.

A secondary question: what is the admission charge for a mid-level ticket?  For a Reds game, I usually pay about $25 American for decent seats--not great, but not bad.  For Ohio State tickets, the minimum charge is $60 American for even the most distant seats.

Where I work, there are four of us ladies in customer service. Two of us are proud geeks and, thanks to my wheedling towards my fellow geek, are both now fans of Doctor Who. One of the less ""geek""-minded girls likes to make mix CDs for us, entitled ""Songs To Be Aware Of"". I joked today that I needed to make her a ""Nerdy Things To Be Aware Of"" compilation, and she agreed that it was a good idea.

And so, here I am. I've just put together a few episodes for her. And wrote up a short informational bit to read before watching. And then decorated the DVD case with sharpies in about two minutes.

The basic idea is that she'll understand our Whovian in-jokes, will be able to see what we deemed the ""best"" bits of the show, and will see if she likes it enough to want to watch the entire thing. She's not exactly a science fiction nut, but she's very open-minded to things like that. It's a very cool feature. I work with good people.

**Episodes I Chose For a Non-Whovian**

* The End Of The World
* The Empty Child
* The Doctor Dances
* Christmas Invasion
* New Earth
* Human Nature
* The Family of Blood
* Blink
* Silence in the Library
* Forest of the Dead
* The Eleventh Hour
* Let's Kill Hitler
* The God Complex
* The Doctor, The Widow, and The Wardrobe

**The Short Intro**

[Is Here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DcAAt6INVbbZnYkhpTGfqa2cb3Y1UtzvryKMc_Rv4gA/edit?usp=sharing) and contains a few spoilers

**My ~~terrible~~ Beautiful CD Case**

[Is Here](http://i.imgur.com/oWb8H6C.jpg). On the disc, which you can slightly see through my doodling, says ""Nerdy Things To Be Aware Of, Volume 1: Doctor Who""

**The Questions**

What episodes besides these would you recommend as necessary watching to someone who knows nothing of the show, and has little time to watch it?

What episodes that I listed would you NOT recommend, and why?

With the signings we have made so far this season, our squad even without Bale is still a very dangerous one. We have very good players in multiple positions, and if we are indeed moving to 4-3-3 then I wouldn't be surprised to see us lining up like this:

    --------------Soldado/Adebayor/Defoe-----------
    --------------------------------------------
    Chadli/Townsend----------------------Holtby/Lennon
    --------------------------------------------
    --------Dembele/Paulinho---Siggs/Paulinho----
    --------------------------------------------
    -----------------Sandro/Paulinho-------------
    Rose/BAE--------------------------------Walker/Naughton
    -----------Vert/Daws--------Kaboul/Daws--------
    --------------------------------------------
    -------------------Lloris/Friedel-----------

    Reserves: Dempsey, Huddlestone, Parker, Livermore, Carroll

Contrary to what is apparently popular belief, I don't think we will see Dembele-Sandro-Paulinho starting together all that often. Switching to a 4-3-3 is the perfect opportunity to get Siggs in his prime position as the most attacking midfielder in the center 3, having the freedom to move into the right channel where he was so dangerous for Swansea the season before he came to us. He can get goals from that position, and with Chadli and Holtby playing as attacking wingers we will be creating plenty of chances for Soldado to score from as well - plus Chadli and Holtby are both perfectly capable of finishing by themselves.

It is my personal opinion that this is a top 4 team in itself, even without Bale there is plenty of goal-scoring threat and potential in this squad, more so even than last season. Add to that the ~£80m we would get for selling Bale, and who knows how it could be further improved. Personally I quite fancy the idea that we could potentially fill the gap left by our £80m star winger with a quality player that Levy signed on what was basically a free transfer.

There are of course a few areas that require cover, most notably at CB as without Caulker or Gallas we are now one injury away from having no subs for that position. A young(ish) up-and-comer such as Chiriches would be ideal. Other than that I can't see any real weaknesses in this team. Maybe LB? Rose has got what it takes though in my opinion, he just needs to mature a bit and work on the defensive side of his game (much like Walker). That will only happen if we give him the game time.

If our activity in this transfer window ended with us only selling Bale, I would be sad to see him go but I wouldn't be too disheartened.

COYS!!!

**TL;dr - If Bale leaves and we are indeed switching to a 4-3-3, I think Siggs and Holtby are more than capable of stepping up and picking up the slack between them.**",false,coys,t5_2ryq7,null,null,default,"Even without Bale, we already have enough strength in depth to field a dangerous top 4-5 team.",1,http://www.reddit.com/r/coys/comments/1jmaof/even_without_bale_we_already_have_enough_strength/

I've uploaded the whole show categorised as folders and with episode names (taken from wikipedia) on MEGA.co.nz. With each link, you can download it as a .zip file if you right click the folder name on the left hand side sidebar. 

All the tracks have had replay gain adjusted so the volumes aren't unexpected. They were all ripped from Youtube.

Was wondering if anyone could help, I'm not very mechanically inclined but trying to resolve this issue.

My bike 2007 honda cg was running perfect until yesterday

Basically it wouldn't start.. I could hear the starter, then I put the choke on and got it idling for a while it would just die when I touched the throttle, after the bike had sat for 10-15 minutes I could rev the bike in neutral.. if I put it in first and try to pull off the engine sounds like it is bogged down and then dies.

Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

Cheers

edit when it is warm I can rev it in neutral with the choke on or off without it dying

EDIT:: I was putting it into first on the stand it kept cutting out when I put the throttle on.. did this a few times and then it started running fine?! just ran it around my town for bout 20 minutes with no issues. Going to try it again in a few minutes...

Another edit.. ran the 2nd time fine :-)",false,MotoUK,t5_2wf1v,null,null,self,Bike dies when I try to pull off,3,http://www.reddit.com/r/MotoUK/comments/1jmd3s/bike_dies_when_i_try_to_pull_off/

* Newport get their first goal of the Football League in over 25 years as they take the lead at home to Accrington.

* Dagenham and Redbridge get a goal back at Fleetwood, getting back in to the game. One more goal and its even.

* Portsmouth get their first goal of their season and gives the fans a glimmer of optimism for the season as Agyemang makes it 1-0 against Oxford United.

* Last years Conference winners, Mansfield Town, go 1-0 down to Scunthorpe as Matt Sparrow scores.

* Cheltenham having a brilliant start to the season as they go 2-0 up against Burton now! I predicted they would win the League this season in the prediction thread ;)

* OOOOOHHHH!!! Oxford have **equalised** with Portsmouth in front of 18,000 Portsmouth fans!

* Bradford and Port Vale now equalise against Bristol City and Brentford respectively in League One! Bradford wonder kid Nahki Wells the goalscorer for Bradford and Doug Loft the goalscorer for Vale.

* OH MY WORD! Oxford are now **2-1** up against /r/LeagueTwo favourites Portsmouth away from home!

* Scunthorpe are now 2-0 up against League Two newcomers Mansfield Town

* Burton are back in the game as they make it 2-1 from the spot.

* **HALF TIME IN LEAGUE TWO** - *Goals in 7/12 games in League Two. Most goals come from the Portsmouth game where there are 3 goals (1-2).*

* Scunthorpe and Newport are currently top of the league as they are two goals in front, more than any other team.

* Rochdale score against Hartlepool - Jeff Stelling won't be too happy!

* Chesterfield break the silence against Bury and make it 1-0!

* 9/12 teams have scored now! Doubt there will be any 0-0 games today!

* Now 2-0 to Rochdale against Hartlepool, not too sure whats going on, just heard they scored a penalty!

* Fleetwood look to have already won this game as they now go 3-1 up, and have now scored more goals than any other League Two side!

* Accrington having a hellish start to the season as they now go 3-0 down to Newport. Dream start for the newcomers, they are now at the **TOP** of the league!

* **OH MY**, Burton have turned their game around! They were 2-0 down to Cheltenham and they have now equalised to make it 2-2!

* Rochdale join Newport at the top of the league as they go **3-0** up against Hartlepool. Awful start for Hartlepool.

* Exeter City have broken the deadlock at St. James Park as they go 1-0 up against Bristol Rovers! Now only 2 games remain at 0-0. But still, *fuck you* Exeter. ;)

* Portsmouth down to **TEN MEN** as Ertl gets sent off. Gets worse and worse for them.

* And that reigns true. It gets worse for Portsmouth. They are now 3-1 down to Oxford. Ouch..

* Now 0-2 to Chesterfield. League One relegatee's aren't doing too well. Portsmouth losing, Bury losing, Hartlepool losing, only Scunthorpe are winning!

* YEEEEAAAAAHHH! Bristol Rovers equalise against Exeter away from home with a corner! 1-1

* Newport are absolutely kicking arse here! **4-0** up against Accrington and look to stay top of League Two for another week!

* Accrington get a consolation goal at Newport as they make it 4-1. At least it makes Newport's goal different a little less scary.

* It really is not Portsmouth's day. They now go 4-1 down at **HOME**! Oxford join the +3 goal different club.

* Exeter get a late goal! 2-1 against Bristol Rovers.

* Burton get a goal to make it 3-2 against Cheltenham...only problem is its disallowed.

* Wimbledon break the deadlock at the **last minute** to make it 1-0 to Wimbledon against Torquay.

* York now do a **repeat** of what Wimbledon have just done! They have broken the deadlock to make it 1-0 against Northampton. Fans must be going mental, I imagine! Now all the games in League Two have had at least one goal! An amazing opening day!

* Most/all teams have now approached the 90 minute mark and are now going in to extra time.

* TORQUAY EQUALISE IN EXTRA TIME. 1-1!

* FT: York City 1-0 Northampton Town

* All games have finished now. My beloved Plymouth have lost. To make it worse, Exeter got a last minute win and Torquay get a last minute equaliser.",false,LeagueTwo,t5_2wn55,null,null,self,MATCH THREAD: League Two opening day!,8,http://www.reddit.com/r/LeagueTwo/comments/1jmk1x/match_thread_league_two_opening_day/

Didn't see a thread anywhere for this so thought I would create one for everyone.

Formation: 4-2-3-1

Lineup: Lloris; Walker, Fryers, Livermore, Rose; Dembele, Parker; Lennon, Chadli, Sigurdsson; Defoe

Subs: Friedel, Naughton, Stewart, Bentaleb, Carroll, Huddlestone, Townsend, Kane.



**Pre-Match Commentary**: Stated that Dawson is injured and not sure for how long, but most interestingly that Adebayor has not travelled for ""personal reasons"". Could he be close to being on his way out to Besiktas or elsewhere?

**9 Min**: Defoe is subbed off for Harry Kane, pointing to his left hamstring. Doesn't look like anything more than a precaution.

**12 Min**: Walker swings in a cross from the right. It should be dealt with easily by Subasic but he only succeeds in patting it straight to Chadli. He feints to shoot, dropping the shoulder, but Carvalho isn't buying it.

**14 Min**: Goal to Monaco. Hugo beaten far too easily at his near post by Raggi (Rodriguez assist) and left ""red faced"" as the commentator put it. 

**20 Min**: The commentator just said ""oh my days"".

**27 Min**: Parker completes a 360 degree turn and passes it backwards.

**28 Min**: Livermore gets nutmegged in a clusterfuck of 3 or 4 players, only for Hugo to claim the ball on the edge of the box and prevent Falcao a 1 on 1 opportunity.

**35 Min**: Commentator announces that our final pre-season game against Espanyol will also be televised on ITV4, next Saturday at 5.15pm.

**37 Min**: Kane brings down the ball with an excellent touch, only to attempt to shoot at the corner flag.

**38 Min**: Kane seems to be doing some good in the midfield, but not much up front. Rose looks decent going forward but again, lacking defensive discipline and doesn't track back well. 

**39 Min**: Sigurdsson attempts a ""Gareth Bale"" curler, fails miserably.

**41 Min**: Walker takes a stinger of a free kick, Monaco keeper can only parry it out for a corner.

**42 Min**: We still can't score from corners. 

**44 Min**: A group of 20 pigeons have gathered at the left side of our box. Unconfirmed reports coming in that they have actually been nesting in Lennons beard the whole time.

** **HALF TIME** **


**First impressions**: Walker looking solid throughout his entire pre-season, and continues that trend. Rose looks decent going forward, but defensively looks sketchy. Livermore tried at CB, gets nutmegged. Chadli hasn't impressed and seems to try too much at times, but it's early days for him, we can't judge on a pre season friendly in a Tottenham C/B team.

** **2ND HALF** **

**47 Min**: Goal to Monaco. Free kick conceded by Chadli on the left of our box. Ocampos gets between TWO defenders as they watch him rise and head the ball in from the free kick. Awful defending. 

**49 Min**: Another goal to Monaco...Falcao sticks home the cross from Ocampos across the back line.

**52 Min**: I wish we signed Moutinho.

**55 Min**: Rose breaks through and takes a shot, curls wide of the top left corner.

**57 Min**: GOAL TO SPURS! Dembele picks up the ball from Chadli in the centre of the park, drives it through the midfield and into the box which could of ended in a penalty had the referee not allowed play to continue, Kane latched onto it and placed it home.  3 - 1

**Substitution**: Chadli off. Townsend on.

**65 Min**: Goal to Monaco. Another cross whipped low from Ocampos, Falcao finishes. 4 - 1.

**70 Min**: Goal to Monaco. They catch us on the break and.....oh who am I kidding. Can it be over now?

**75 Min**: Falcao receives the ball in our box and tries to set up Moutinho who just runs it a bit too far into Hugos hands.


**79 Min**: Huddlestone makes an attempt from far out. I won't tell you if it went in or not, I'm just going to say that he wont be getting his hair cut any time soon. 

**82 Min**: Falcao with too much space in the box latches onto a cross and heads the ball powerfully...luckily straight into Hugo's hands. 

**Substitutions**: I've lost track of this, but Naughton, Huddlestone and Carroll are on. 

**84 Min**: GOAL TO SPURS! Townsends dispossesses a player, drives towards the outside of Monaco's D and sticks it home in the bottom right corner. 5 - 2

**Substitution**: Parker off, Bentaleb on. Walker off, Stewart on.

My name is PointyElf (or Kasey) and I've been playing Dota2 now for just over a year. I'm coming up to two thousand hours and would now like to start looking at entering the competitive scene.  
I've stood in for a couple of swedish/netherlandish teams with friends but only played for a laugh and never set our hearts on winning. I have a lot of knowledge about the game (although i am still learning) and feel with four other committed players we could break through into the scene. I would like to put together a full UK roster and enter into some of the LAN tournaments around the UK.  
The positions i'm looking to fill are 2,3,4,5. I'm also looking for someone within one of these roles to draft. While i myself am confident in drafting, i know there is someone who will draft with a lot more confidence and knowledge than I. 
 
I'm looking for a minimum of 7 people to start the trials but if we hit ten, we will have our own in-house games.  

Flaming will not be tolerated, while commenting on what a player did/could of done better is all well and good any sort of bullying and harassment and you will be kicked off the trials straight away.
  
You will be judged during the trials on; The amount of wins you total/Attitude/Communication/Skill.  Before applying and entering trials there are a couple of requirements;  
1. Be British/Irish/Scottish/Welsh  2. 1500 hours+ of Dota1/2 (If we do not meet the requirement for application amounts i will lower this to see fit.) 3. Have Mumble.
  
After posting your steam ID i will send the mumble details over to you through steam.
  
I'm looking to have the trials extend over two weeks. The first week narrowing it down to five/six players with the final week finding our best five. 
We will be playing 7pm onwards, with Mondays and Thursdays off. You can contact me on steam or via reddit SteamID PointyElf.    
Lastly, this post will have grammatical errors and probably bad formatting, but if we could focus on the main points that would be wonderful. Thank you and goodluck!

Then I think, there's 6 of you. Mostly girls, couple of lads. And not one of you has a phone?? Right. I don't believe that. The only reason I don't is cause I'm weird like that.

There's the occasional one that might ask for a tab (a Northern cigarette) straight up but these ones just ask for the time.. And I don't understand why..

I don't think they're trying to gauge my friendless for then asking if I'll go to the shops for them, because this has happened nowhere near the shops before. Or likewise gauge if I'm easy to rob, cause they're too young.

It's the 60th minute really, so I'll just put in points that I think are worth reporting and talking about in the thread. :)

Decided to make this as soon as Harry Kane scored a few minutes ago after Dembele forced his way into the box.

Also - this commentator is getting Chadli and Dembele confused.

**Monaco Line-Up:**

Danijel Subasic

Andrea Raggi

Layvin Kurzawa

Ricardo Carvalho

Éric Abidal

Jérémy Toulalan

Mounir Obbadi

Joao Moutinho

Yannick Carrasco

James Rodríguez

Radamel Falcao




**Spurs Line Up:**

Hugo Lloris

Kyle Walker

Ezekiel Fryers

Jake Livermore

Danny Rose

Nacer Chadli

Aaron Lennon

Scott Parker

Mousa Dembele

Gylfi Sigurdsson

Jermain Defoe


63 - Rose just took the ball off Falcao. So that happened.

66 - Falcao just smacked the ball in for a fourth goal after a low cross from the right.

69 - Lennon looks to break forward but Carasco pulls him back and gets a yellow for his fine effort. Asshole.

70 - Parker dances and does a couple of his 360's between three Monaco players before laying it off for Townsend who wins a free kick at the edge of the penalty area. Siggy delivers and the keeper punches it away.

71 - Monaco counter attack from the resulting punchaway, a swift counter attack which has Livermore trying to understand what a Center Back does sees Monaco score their fifth. Why did I make this thread?

73 - Monaco fans chanting something along the likes of ""Ole!"" with each touch of the ball.

74 - Commentator confuses Townsend for Walker.

75 - Townsend does well to get forward but then Rose happens.

76 - Huddlestone is on because we need to concede three more. Who went off? Dembele. We really have given up haven't we.

77 - Naughton comes on for Rose. Ball bounces off Siggy's chest but ref thinks it's handball. Falcao smiles.

79 - Naughton double tackle in our box to save a possible sixth goal. Good job Kyle.

80 - Huddlestone loses the ball. Regains the ball. Then takes a shot from 35 yards which skids off the surface and isn't actually that far away but the keeper looked like he had it covered.

81 - Lennon off, Carroll on.

83 - Falcao gets an open header at goal but Lloris is well positioned.

85 - Absolutely brilliant by Townsend as he gets past 3 Monaco players and smacks a shot from outside the box into the low corner of the goal. Great stuff.

88 - Double change for Spurs. Parker comes off, as does Kyle Walker. On come Stewart and Bentaleb.

90+ - Falcao's hat trick is denied by Huddlestone.

I spent a year in Afghanistan a few years back, and shared a base with British army soldiers. I worked as a liaison officer, so I spent quite a bit of time with them (they were from the 'coldstream guards', and the 'royal yorkshires'(?), if that matters). 
Anyway, a few things that I have always wondered about:

One of the enlisted guys I hung out with almost every day. At one point, I asked where he was from, and he replied 'I'm from bloody Essex, where shit goes down!' I laughed, but he seemed serious. What is the story with Essex? Is it some ghetto, or was he being facetious?

Also, I overheard some British soldiers doing their impressions of an 'American accent', and they all sounded like Yosemite Sam. Is this what English people think Americans sound like? In a closely related point, they always assumed we were from Texas too. I would hate to think that our worst state is the face that we are showing to the world.

This has just come in via the post-monaco press conference, I watched it on Sky Sports, recorded and typed it up for you guys. We might have some hope yet with the Bale situation.

From AVB:

&gt; ""I think that the rumours about that something is imminent is not true. Obviously we have allowed ourselves conversations with Real Madrid, confirmed by their coach, I think...wrongly.""

&gt;""But the only thing we have communicated is that the player is our player and not for sale.""

Reporter: ""It's just that there are meetings coming in the next few days for sure...

&gt;""...no, there is conversations because there is big respect between the two clubs, baring in mind the transfer last year and the agreement signed last year of good will between the two clubs, and the respect between them. So, I dont know what we are following from those instructions, the player, baring in mind the investment you are seeing here from Tottenham recently is of a player that is decisive for us.""

&gt;""We believe we have a very very strong team and you know, we are looking towards the future with Gareth. In the end you know in football anything is possible. What we have communicated so far is that, you know, we are not willing to concede in their interest in our player.""

Reporter: ""Have you prepared mentally for his departure or....""

&gt; AVB sighs... ""....no, I have been very very frank with you guys tonight, and I have extended my answer baring in mind what I have told you before. So I cannot speculate anymore.""

AVB's PR guy steps in at this point and basically tells them to fuck off and he has made it clear, before a reporter lastly gets in: ""Andre, you said Ancelotti was wrong to bring the subject up...""

&gt;""I think so, in my opinion I think so, I cant be a critic as Carlo is a person I appreciate a lot. And we have great respect for eachother, but...you know, baring in mind this situation, they have decided to make it public. Normally in situations like this in England are scrutinised by the FA with lots of care and attention. You know, we have seen lots of people speaking about a player that is not theres, and you know, we need some respect.""


**Afterthoughts**: This is the best news we have heard yet, but lets not forget...Bale was not playing tonight, he did not come to Monaco which is still worrying. He also sat out the BAT with this mysterious glute injury. The fact is until an official announcement on him staying, a contract extension or him leaving happens we really won't know.

I have been in Plymouth 4 months now and I focus mainly on freelancing.  It would be nice to meet others with similar hobbies to build awesome things and chat about tech.  If you have programming skills, design or an avid geek please let me know below if you are interested.  My plan is to create a group which will puts our skills to use whilst having fun at the same time.  I will phone the council on Monday to see about finding some recreational facilities (when we need to set on projects).  Meeting at a pub or bar might be a better place to start for introductions and formulating ideas.


I do already have a kick-ass project which will be very fun to work on.  It's up to everyone to decide but I'm confident it's a winner.  It's a website service which although not original, is a very new concept for its sector.  It is great starter for a collaboration and will be highly rewarding in many ways.  


Skills required :

* Web Devs (PHP, mySQL, Linux, Apache)
* Designers
* Marketers / S.E.O
* Admins


This task is great for getting people on-board with all types of backgrounds.  Even if somebody doesn't have the necessary skills they can help out and learn new things.  We need the core skills to succeed most definitely, but for those who want help can diversify their skillset they can get involved.  I want to be able for anyone who is a bit geeky to have some input.  Other projects might need only a few skills but with this one it can involve everyone and can spawn mini projects alongside it.

If anyone is interested please comment below and list any skills you have.  If you have no program or design skills but are passionate about tech please list that. :)

Once we have some people involved then we can create a sub to organise a meetup and figure out best times to meet etc.  If you have got this far then thanks for reading!  I hope we can form an awesome group with the same passion for technology and the web!

Did anyone at the game today feel that Portsmouth were far too negative on the ball and just seemed happy to pass it backwards and to the side? The wingers hardly took on Oxfords' fullbacks, when we did though, it resulted in a goal! 
Also the errors were horrible to watch after controlling the game for so long!
Views on Teenage Mutant Ninja Ertl's red? Personally I feel it was a fair challenge and didn't think anything of it until the Oxford players kicked off. 
Also did anyone catch what Dave Shitson apparently said/gestured to our directors box? 

Fair play to Oxford they deserved it and I was very impressed with their following, also Alfie Potter tore us a new one!

But, all of these places are rather expensive and do not allow for us to self-cater.

Does anybody here have any advice for us?  We would like a place in which we could provide our own food, booze and hire a Ceilidh band.

Tonight, for the first time in /r/soccer history (as far as I can remember) a Hoop contacted me with a suggestion for a banner pic, without a general request from me. Thanks peetss, as you can see it's live.


All banner suggestions are gratefully received, otherwise it's down to me to keep coming up with ideas, which is fine but I never know if they're good enough or if one of you could have suggested something better. So please feel free to contact me with potential subreddit banners any time.


Also, a big thanks to ultrapleb, who regularly spots my errors in the fixtures list. Without him you'd all be missing games or not know what was going on.


When I get round to setting up the flares function, which will be soon, peetss and ultrapleb will be getting special QPR flairs as acknowledgement for their contributions.

In many instances supporters from both sides have gone into each others subreddits and commented and downvoted and what not. Since I'm a liverpool supporter my examples are only going to include bullshit from the other side. I did some small research (you could definitely find more, and names don't show up in downvotes), take a look at [this](http://imgur.com/0eBU6jd), [this](http://imgur.com/urmdEZo), and [this](http://imgur.com/CWsRqpN), (which funnily enough has nothing to do with Suarez). 

Many born and bred fans rightfully believe that open forums like the internet remove that face of regionalization and makes football fans not only nicer to each other, but it kind of circlejerks it i.e., ""I don't care who wins so long as it's a good game!"" between whichever supporters in whatever match threads that we see on a weekend basis over in r/soccer. Also look at [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/LiverpoolFC/comments/1jl5xd/a_message_to_rliverpoolfc_and_our_visitors_from/).

The response I've seen from our supporters has been awesome. Here's my spiel, I fucking love the rivalry, the douchebaggery, and the bragging. I want to destroy Arsenal in the league and on reddit. Fuck those guys, seriously. The same goes for most any other supporter on r/soccer. While some would call for more mild mannered rational discussion, I say fuck that, give me some tribal banter that makes the winning or losing that much more awesome/terrible. This Suarez saga is another perfect for us to get more fire in our bellies. Don't be nice, be fucking hard.

Obviously it isnt all as romantic as he makes out there must be challenges, but on some level such a life does appeal to me on some level (no Im not thinking of trying it ) - but I couldnt help but think such a lifestyle would not be possible in the UK, wether because of the population density, general attitude of society, almost police-state like laws etc etc.

Either way it would be nice to know one could survive such a lifestyle if it ever became necessary.

I start a job up in Aztec West tomorrow and I'm in the process of trying to find a house share (staying in a temporary apartment for a week first). I have done a good few viewings at this stage.

I had a viewing in a house in the Filton area where the road goes from Filton Rd to Gloucester Road North and I'm just wondering what this area is like? It looks okay to me, I don't think this particular area is a council estate and it seems pretty tidy and residential but still has some shops within walking distance and a quick cycle to Gloucester Road and also a 20 minute cycle to work. Any problems I should know about?

I will likely end up driving and cycling at different times too so I think I would avoid the worst of the traffic down by Bishopston etc by staying up here?
