In a few months time I plan on moving to the UK. Long story short - After having saved a substantial amount of money, I want to move to try and make a career out of stand-up comedy. Obviously I need a full-time job while I'm doing this, but after several months of applying for copywriting jobs, I haven't gotten a single interview offer, so my plan is to come to the UK (probably Manchester) and search for a job while there.

The problem is that there seems to be a bit of a chicken and egg situation when it comes to opening a bank account, in that you need proof of address to open a bank account, and a bank account from which to pay rent. Is there any way I can get around this?

*Captain Jack has been traveling outer planets for a Millennia, drowning himself in drinks, coping with the loneliness of being on his own. His hair has grayed slightly, his face is starting to show lines. His 5,000 year old face is starting to look like 50.

He's finishing a repair job on a spaceship on the planet Zog when he hears a familiar whirring noise.

The TARDIS materializes 50 yards away. He begins to jog over, memories of the adventures he used to have all those centuries ago. His excitement is shattered instantly when a man appearing to be John Frobisher emerges from the blue box...*

SCORE 2 -1

Team in a 442 

Lloris

Vlad- fazio - vert- Davies 

Lennon - mason - zidane- eriksen 

Soldado - Kane 







On sky sports 1 for those here. No idea about any other countries though.  NBCSN for America I'm told. 


1- and we are underway with Everton on the attack from the off

3 - Everton holding onto the ball so far. Nothing really come off it yet. 

6 - Everton still holding the ball but can't seem to find any way through. Solid. 

7 - lovely run from barkley which scrambles through to etoo but is comfortable for Hugo 

9 - evenly matched so far. The main battles are going on in the middle of the pitch.

11 - nice cross in by chiriches. But no one is at the back post.

12 - another cross from chirches but it's caught by the keeper. 

13 - free kick to Everton in a dodgy position 

14- GOAL Everton. Free kick cleared as far as miralas and the jammy cunts sent it to the top corner. 1-0 everton 

16 - Everton holding on the ball. Severe lack of pressing on our part. Everton send a ball in from the left but it's cleared for a corner. 

18 - standard vlad fuck up but lloris is out like usual to clear up 

20 - GOOOOOOAL Eriksen.  A Kane shot is parried and eriksen is there to slam it home. Lad.

24 - the midfield battle continues. 

25 - nice interplay down the right but Lennon and Kane decided to clatter each other. 👍

28 - nice little counter attack. Ends with Kane trying a cheeky chip but didn't come off for him.

29 - intercepted by jan who starts a counter and continues bombing it up the pitch. Kane goes on a run but his shot ends up being weak and an easy save for the Everton keeper

31 - Lennon conceeds a free kick

33 - decent play around the Everton box. Ball fall to eriksen who takes a shot which is deflected for the corner 

35 - our centre backs winning everything in the air 

36 - shot by Coleman which lloris follows all the way. Besic heads the ball back awkwardly but soldado is just behind it 

38 - realised how young our midfield is

39 - eriksen fouled after be put into an awkward situation by jan 

41 - Bentalebs been had by his barber

42 - foul against Lennon. Which results mirallas getting booked for kicking the ball away. 

45 - one minute of added time 

45 + 1 GOAL Soldado!!!!!! Excellent tackle from Kane leads to a quick break. Soldado slide it past Howard. Beauty. 

Half time. Time for a fag and a piss.

I also have 620 messages in my inbox so that's nice. 

Sky movie adverts are always top notch 

45 - second half underway. Yid army. 

45 - no changes from either club 

47 - Everton attack down the right with Coleman who over hits his cross

49 - Everton trying to get an early goal back but can't seem to create an opportunity 

51- Soldado through down the middle but can't match Coleman for pace 

53 - ball whipped in by Davies Soldado wins the header but sends it to the right of the goal

55 - booking for chiriches for pulling back miralas 

56 - awkward clearance form a mason cross leads to a spurs corner

57 - couple of short passes lead to an eriksen cross with fazio connects with but can't steer it goal bound /#defenders 

58 - free kick to Spurs in Everton territory. Ball sticks to Kanes feet which caused the foul

59 - eriksens free kick is straight into the wall

60 - long ranger effort from mason goes over the bar

61 - subs mcgeady and osman on 

61 - Spurs sub with Lamela on for Lennon 

62 - lovely pass and moves from Tottenham. Obviously ends up with vlad smashing it over the bar

64 - barkleys got some sniff hanging out his nose. 

66 - Davies made mcgeady look like a bitch

68 - Kane has run the length of the pitch to help the defenders. Hero. 

69 - vlad off Eric of the dump on 

71 - through ball to Coleman but Hugo is out like always 

72 - a tackle from Lamela. I shit you not

74 - Lamela stuck in the corner with no where to go. Out for a goal kick. 

76 - sitting far too deep for my liking

77- Everton free kick ends up offside

77 - Mrs says she's cheat on me with Hugo. I said I'd do the same . 

78 - Kane does well to get a cross in from the right but it ends up at the back post with no one around

80 - Paulinho on for Soldado to sure up the midfield

81 - some good pressure around the Everton box after Lamela closes it down. Paulinho wins the corner. 

82 - nothing comes of it

83 - Paulinho plays a lovely through ball but the Everton defender gets there first

84 - Spurs have been meticulous - g nev 

86 - Lamela booked for a knick on baines 

88 - booking for Davies for showing lukaku who's in charge 

89 - my arse hole puckered so much it whistled 

91 - 2 mins left of added time. Spurs free kick by the corner flag

92 - booking for eriksen. Red handing out more yellows than a British Gas engineer 

92 - penalty shout for Kane. Seen them given. 

94 - full time at the lane. Goals from eriksen and Soldado give Spurs the 2-1 win.

**Match Info**

**'15:** **GOAL!!, Everton** Mirallas takes it from a corner and curls it into the corner of the net from outside the box, 1-0 Everton

**'21:** **GOAL!, Tottenham** Kane's Shot is parried by Howard, but Eriksen takes the ball and chips Coleman, Howard, and Barry and it lands in the far corner, 1-1

**'27:** Kane with a great run through several Everton players, but Jagielka makes a terrific tackle in the box to stop the rush

**'29:** With Howard coming off of his line, Kane tries to chip the keeper from 25 yards out, but sends it a few yards over the goal

**'30:** Kane is providing plenty of problems for the Everton midfield as he once again gets through several of our players on the way to the box, but he's shut down again before he's able to enter the area and his low shot is easily collected by Howard.

**'33:** Lot's of chances coming just outside Everton's box, as Eriksen shoots from the top of the semi-circle, but it drifts just a yard wide.

**'37:** After Coleman's long range effort is easily collected by Lloris, Besic nearly gifts Soldado with an easy goal at the other end of the pitch, but the Spanish striker can only flick it on into the arms of Howard.

**'45:** Only 1 extra minute of stoppage time, both teams being held by the defences

**'45+1:** **GOAL!, Tottenham** Baines turns it over to Lennon rushing up the midfield, who quickly turns it up to Soldado who slots it past Howard. 2-1 Spurs

**Halftime, 2-1 Tottenham** After a ferocious start, both teams were held outside of the penalty areas for the rest of the half, until Soldado broke through in the final seconds

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Halftime Stats:**

**Tackles** | 17 | 20
**Fouls** | 2 | 6

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**'46:** Second Half Begins!

**'49:** Everton creeping their way into the box, a Mirallas cross is headed into the box by Barkley, but Eto'o can't quite control it and it's cleared into touch.

**'51:** Everton mounting pressure, but still no good touches in the box as Barry's cross lobs over Coleman's head and out of play.

**'54:** Another Kane shot from outside the box, but Howard easily tracks it and catches it, still nothing happening inside either box

**'58:** Eriksen crosses it in just in front of goal, but Fazio whiffs on the ball from three yards out.

**'59:** Once again Harry Kane runs easily through the midfield, and draws a foul from Barry in a scoring position, but the free kick hits the wall

**'61:** Subsitution: For Everton, Osman and McGeady come on for Eto'o and Mirallas. Tottenham take off Lennon and bring on Lamela

**'69:** Barkley runs through almost every Spurs player on the pitch, but it comes to Osman on the edge of the box and he isn't allowed to take a second touch by the Spurs' defenders

**'70:** Chiriches comes off with what looks like a slight back injury, Eric Dier comes on in his replacement

**'72:** Barkley finds Coleman running through the box, but by the time he gets the ball he's in to tight to Lloris, and the Spurs' goalkeeper deflects the ball behind for a corner

**'81:** Substitution: Paulinho comes on for Soldado for the Spurs

**'84:** Lamela finds the ball at his feet inside the box, but an excellent tackle by Jagielka keeps the chance at bay.

**'88:** Dier deflects Coleman's cross behind for a corner in the dying minutes

**'89:** Lukaku's brought down two yards outside the box by Davies, who receives a yellow, pressure mounting. Lukaku's header was cleared off the line

**'90:** 3 minutes of extra time for Everton to find an equalizer, they have the run of play as of now

**'90+3:** **Full Time, 2-1 Tottenham** Despite mounting pressure in the final 20 minutes, Everton failed to get any meaningful touches in the box and Spurs hold on for the win.

I live in Croydon and have done for about a year. I like it because it's a short distance to both the centre of London and Redhill/Gatwick. Being on the Gatwick line, it also means that there are trains 24 hours, even on the weekend.

My current flat mate is moving out to move on to bigger and better things.

However trying to find someone to fill the room is proving really really difficult. I appreciate Croydon might not be the most glamorous of locations but considering the flat location, literally 30 seconds from South Croydon station, less than 15 minutes to East Croydon, and the size of the place it's not that unreasonable.

The closest equivalent I can find on Spareroom that includes off road parking, is £25 per month more after bills - what am I doing wrong? Am I just a victim of poor timing as nobody wants to move over Christmas?

General feedback on the Spareroom ad was that the bills didn't seem reasonable so I put a breakdown on the description... but not sure what else I can do to make the ad seem more attractive?

Is there anything else I can try apart from Spareroom to try and generate some interest?

Thanks

One, Lamela, is a naturally gifted footballer. The other, Kane, is not as naturally gifted. He's got a good touch, is a good finisher and holds the ball up well, but he's not got the pure talent of Lamela. 

However, Kane has such a good footballing brain. He's always aware of what's going on and who is around him. He nearly always chooses the right option. He offers so much.

Lamela, in contrast, must have the worst footballing brain of any player in the squad. For a naturally gifted player, he seems to always choose the wrong option. He holds onto the ball when he should pass. He dribbles into the wrong areas. He shoots when he should pass and passes when he should shoot. He loses the ball when he should be protecting it. Against Everton, his sum total contribution was to give away the ball, foul people, and dribble into dead ends. 

If he had the footballing intelligence to go with his skill, he'd be a decent player. As it is, we looked much better with Lennon in the team.",false,coys,t5_2ryq7,null,null,self,Kane vs Lamela,6,http://www.reddit.com/r/coys/comments/2nv42p/kane_vs_lamela/

The second half is some data I collected a couple of months ago and figured I might as well update and share, the first half is my attempt to actually make this thread constructive to the subreddit.

***

A couple of months ago, I went through all the match threads for the last year (see below) and one of the big things I noticed was a lot of variability in the content. One thing that mostly stood out to me was that some people have some pretty neat things which they include in match threads, and which don't get carried across when other people do them. I think this is partly down to personal taste of what works best, partly down to visibility, and partly because making anything look fancy within the limitations of a Reddit post is a massive ballache. 

Another thing I know, from running match threads myself, is that feedback is incredibly thin on the ground. I do what *I* feel is a good job, but for obvious reasons most people care more about the game than the thread at the time. Even if people do comment critiquing or giving props, it's typically easy to miss those sorts of comments amongst the 1000 or so that a match thread usually gets.

So, **I'm making this thread to open discussion on what people like and dislike with match threads on this sub** (putting that in bold so people can find it amongst the wall of text).

Maybe you don't give a shit about the OP and just want somewhere to vent when Balotelli hits the bar from 4 yards out, but for the people who *do* pay attention to the top post it's helpful to get some feedback on what people in typically enjoy and want. From things you like about the current threads we have, to commentary style, or maybe things you've seen in other subs' match threads that you'd like to see added in more often here. 

With comments, I'd ask people to bear a couple of things in mind:

* Match threads are pretty hectic to run - trying to keep track of the match, the comments *and* keep the first post updated is difficult. I'd say anything more than the commentary and score would be difficult to keep properly updated unless there was a heavy amount of automation in there. I'd love to update consistently with shots on goal, corners, fouls and other stats, but as far as I can see it it'd be really difficult to do it right now - I might give it a shot the next thread I do though. 

* Reddit formatting is absolutely shite and anything that goes beyond basic text and tables is typically a massive headache. The editor will also occasionally just reverse previous edits you made for no good reason at all.

So yeah, feedback appreciated. I can't guarantee that anything said here will actually be taken into account by anyone, but I'll make an effort to include things at least. As far as I know this discussion hasn't really been had here before, and I'm genuinely curious to what people say.  

***

The second part of this thread is just some data I made after the Everton game, which I'm releasing partly for interest and partly as a bit of a shoutout to people who have actually run the match threads in the last 12 months or so.

I did this because I was running the match thread for the derby, with Jagielka's flukey last-minute equaliser, after also doing the match threads for the Chelsea game last season (Gerrard's infamous slip) and our FA Cup defeat to Arsenal (one of the few times we lost in the second half of last season). Worried that I might be a bad luck charm and should therefore quit doing match threads forever, and out of a mix of boredom and curiosity, I went back for the last 12 months to compare win-rates with everyone else who did match threads recently (short story: I was fine).

I've since updated it so that (hopefully) it's everything in the last 14 months or so, though Reddit's search function isn't brilliant and ""Match Thread"" gives me all the post and pre match threads to filter out, so apologies if I missed anyone. I also only included competitive matches, i.e. not friendlies. So, in descending order of matches covered:

**/u/hmurya**: 12 games, 4W-2D-6L (33% winrate)

**/u/Rosti_LFC**: 8 games, 5W-1D-2L (62.5%)

**/u/Mozza215**: 6 games, 4W-1D-1L (66.7%)

**/u/EpicRageGuy**: 4 games, 4W (100%, do more threads please...)

**/u/TeaDrinkingParty**: 4 games, 3W-1D (75%)

**/u/beachedwhale2**: 3 games, 2W-1D (66%)

**/u/LFCmatchday**: 2 games, 1W-1D (50%)

**/u/Charraze**: 2 games, 1W-1L (50%)

And then for users who did one game each: /u/redadil4 1W, /u/beachwood23 1W (though /u/NightHawkz did commentary), /u/greezeh 1L, /u/surveybot 1W, /u/mamadou17sakho 1L, /u/GobiasBlunke 1D, /u/AgentFabioHasDoneIt 1W

And I'd also like to give shoutouts to /u/OfficePlum for doing absolutely craptons of pre-match and post-match threads of top quality (and everyone else who does them, who are too numerous to mention), and to /u/Stevee04 for doing loads of the U18 and U21 match threads with more effort than a good chunk of the first team ones. And apologies again if I've missed anyone off, or spelt someone's name wrong. And for the record I don't *actually* believe that our match thread author seriously affects how we do on the pitch, it's just for fun.

So; I've had the Fazer for about 5 months now, and may well sell it on in June when my insurance is due for renewal.

I know it's a long way off yet, but thinking about potential bikes to replace it/upgrade from it.

**Thought i'd ask for your thoughts on the matter.**

Presently, i'm thinking of staying under 1000cc due to the difference in weight/handling which is involved with those bikes. Having said that; A 1000cc Fazer is on the very short/new list of bikes to consider.

Budget is a big issue. I'd like to keep it below £2000. I don't mind doing some work on a bike, though. It'll also come down to what i can get at the time, but a discussion here will help guide my wallet.

Speaking of:

* **Honda VFR 800 (1998)** - I've head good things about this bike. Also seen some [nice 'fighter conversions](https://imgur.com/ufD3ZuK).

* **Suzuki SV1000** - Mostly because i like the idea of a V-twin (or V4 as above) and the SVs seem to be reliable etc. Not too sure on the sporty TL version. I don't like the seating/bar position in general, and would like to stay pretty upright.

* **Yamaha 650 Dragstar** - Also considering switching back to a cruiser. If i get a faster sports-ish bike, i know i'll end up with another speeding ticket or worse.

* **Fazer thousand** - As mentioned. Not sure which year or amount of fairing at this point. But fairing might be good. Anything over 40 on my 'fighered 600 fazer is noisy and irritating.

* **Kawasaki Z750** - Popular choice, so i gather.

----

Notes:

* Very much not after a sports bike. Just not for me, so no GSXR suggestions ;)
* Might be tempted by a cruiser
* Might be tempted by an adventure style road bike
* Comfort is vital: Upright and a level seat would be great. Seat height isn't too much a factor, i'm 5'11.
* I'd like a potential bike to have a bit more in the low end than the Fazer does currently.
* I have no intentions of going nuts on this, 80 is fast enough for me.
* Tank range and economy are a concern (i'm not captain rich).
* As for usage: Mostly city, occasional country roads, rare holiday travel. No offroad use
* Liquid cooled would be good. Never fun having an overheating bike in summer traffic.",false,MotoUK,t5_2wf1v,null,null,self,Suggestions for a bike after my current 1999 FZS600?,1,http://www.reddit.com/r/MotoUK/comments/2nviau/suggestions_for_a_bike_after_my_current_1999/

2. They had a draw against Sunderland (which we also had) and a win that could possibly end as a tie against QPR (we scored 4 goals, they had an 1x1 and a penalty). It surely doesn't guarantee a great match against them, but we have some numbers at our side. 

3. Our players are improving. Today we saw Soldado score, and some underperforming players like Chiriches, Fazio and Paulinho (despite his shallow time) also are having great performances. We have a talented squad, we just need to make them work together. 

4. Poch's management is also improving. He is doing some great choices lately, and I'm still confident about him. 

5. They are our guys, and we should support and trust them whatever it's the reason.

-What should I wear? (regarding the interview and weather this time of year)

-Is it possible to get interviews with other colleges within Oxford?

-Is there anything in particular I need to be careful about in British culture? (I don't want to offend anyone)

We have a team full of strangers, who don't fight for any cause and are in it as employees. It was said that we have lacked any sort of identity over the past couple years. Nothing we can cling on to, no players we can identify with, no players who would die for the cause, a team no fan can relate to anymore.

It's been a shit couple of years, no matter which way you look at it. Under harry, we had that British core as well as being sprinkled with some world class talent, a cohesive team and one the players could identify themselves with. Bale was the last bit of any sort of identity we as fans could have related to the players, as the past year and a half or so has been a clusterfuck of mis-management, on and off the pitch. Some of the worst and laziest performances by players, even during our dark days in the late 90's recently, you still had that feeling that some of these players were willing to drive this club forward, no matter how bad things were. We haven't been able to feel that recently because of how much of a bottle job this squad has been. 

However, now, even though Pochettino has gotten some flack already and made a few questionable decisions (Kaboul and Adebayor being captain for one), the side's developing a real identity with a core of youngsters right at the heart of it, that's cause for optimism. People have also been giving us fans flack for getting on the teams back, having too high expectations, not supporting the team, which couldn't be further from the truth. Even when the score was 1-1 today, the fans in the ground, and the fans on here, were buzzing. Why? Because our players were showing fight and were driving forward, we were breaking forward in numbers, the players were showing determination and the will to get forward and win the game. That's all it takes to get us Spurs fans engaged, and why we love this club. The Lane was rocking today.

It's obvious the constant upheaval has had such a detrimental affect on the club, and it looks as if it's finally the time where the club is backing the manager from all angels, and giving him the freedom and power to re-acquaint this team into something special.

**Updated with some additional analysis - italics**

I’ve run a few numbers based on data I’ve found so far for this season and last season (sources are at the end of this post). I will update with more analysis as I go along but wanted to share some early insights. This is to stimulate discussion based on data, so feel free to share your thoughts. I have all the data in excel and can try to do requests if the data is available. If you have other updated sources for LFC player data in excel that I can use, that would be very helpful too.
  
Meanwhile, here we go:
  
We have used 22 players so far this season in the EPL. That’s the same number we used by the same point last season, having played a total of 5 less fixtures (UCL matches). *We ended up using 25 players last season in total. The other three players, Brad Smith, Jordon Ibe and Joao Teixeira, played 52 minutes between them.*

*We used 11 defenders, 9 midfielders and 4 attackers last season (Raheem is considered a midfielder). This season those numbers are 9, 9 and 4. Of player reasonably expected to have game time this season, Flanagan and Suso have not played yet due to injury.*

Our record after the UCL games this season is 2-1-2. We have lost to West Ham and Chelsea, drawn with Hull, and beaten WBA and Stoke. 

*Phil Dowd has officiated 5 of our wins this and last season. Mark Clattenburg has 4. Martin Atkinson, Lee Mason and bogeyman Howard Webb have all officiated 2 losses each. Martin Atkinson has taken one of our games this season and that was the 1-1 draw with Everton.*

Average minutes played per game is 46 min. This compares to an average of 39.6 min over the whole of last season. In other words, it was more likely that a rotated (squad) player would play in any particular game last season than so far this season. 

I looked at the core group (i.e. outfield players who are/were guaranteed starters and usually played 90 min every game), and last season the top 4 starters (above 2900 min total) were Skrtel, Henderson, Suarez and Gerrard. This season, 4 players can be considered core (above 1000 min total) – Gerrard, Sterling, Lovren and Henderson. 

Last season, core players played 18 minutes more on average than non-core players. This season, the difference is 8 minutes.   
  
Looking at match stats, home and away and across wins and losses, we can see a few differences from last year already.

The team is facing, on average, 2.3 less shots per game (SPG) than last year. We’re also seeing 0.7 less shots on target (STPG). On the other hand, we’re taking 1.9 less SPG and more shots are off-target (1.4 less STPG). 

While our STPG average has remained very similar to last year when away from home, we’re shooting 2.8 less STPG at home this season. In keeping with above, we’re facing less SPG at home (2.0 less) but unusually, STPG faced has risen by 0.5 this season versus last. 

*On average, we concede as many STPG in a win as we do in defeat this season (4.3 / 4.2). Last season we conceded 5.5 STPG in defeat and 3.1 in our wins.*   

*In terms of net shots on target (our STPG minus their STPG), we take 2 more than our opponents in wins this season and 1.3 less in losses. Last season we took 4.4 more shots (more made, less faced) in wins than our opponents and only 0.5 less in losses. Even in defeat we took 5 STPG. This season, that number is 2.8.*  
  
I also looked at very high level match results per half. Again, this is very high level and meant only to be representative. This data may be misleading so I caution drawing too many conclusions from it. 

I came up with a number of outcomes as follows:

-	Held lead: Won 1st and 2nd half
-	Conceded draw: Won 1st but match ended in draw
-	Won 2nd half: Draw at HT, won 2nd half
-	Lost 2nd half: Draw at HT, lost 2nd half
-	Threw away game: Won 1st half, lost 2nd half and game
-	Never recovered: Lost 1st and 2nd half
  
These “outcomes” accounted for 35 out of 38 games last season, and 10 out of 12 of this season’s games. The only outcome we haven’t had so far in either season is to throw away a game over 2 halves. All percentages below are based on total games (38 last season, 12 this season - not counting Stoke).
  
Last season, in 66% out of all 38 games, we held the lead or won the 2nd half. In 11% we conceded a draw after going in to the break in the lead. These outcomes were largely the result of our penchant for fast starts last season. This season those numbers are 33% and 0% respectively.   
  
In 5% of our games last season, we were beaten in the 2nd half after drawing at HT. 11% of our games saw us lose both halves. 3 of these were away from home, 1 at home. This season, we have lost the 2nd half 25% of the time and never recovered 25% of the time. 2 of those games were away, 1 at home.   
  
Interestingly, last season we only lost the 2nd half twice. This season we have done that 3 times, once at home, twice away. 66% of our defeats away from home have seen us concede in the second half or fail to recover from going down. Last season, this percentage was 21.  
  
Unsurprisingly, holding a lead is our biggest change year-on-year, with a 30 point fall from 55% to 25% this season reflecting a combination of our inability to score early and our difficulty in holding on to a lead.

Personally, I think Besic has been amazing considering his age and newness in the league, and I'm saying that with the same relative understanding that we all judged Lukaku and Barkley with last season. That is, both of the latter took some chances and fucked up sometimes but they put their all out there last season and everyone loved them because of the promise and heart they showed for their age. 

For me, Besic is the same, I mean he's not going to be doing flare-y attacking things that will make us love him like Ross's solo goal or Lukaku's many moments of gold, but he was one of our most solid defenders today and during Wolfsburg. He chased down his target and played aggressive far after the other defenders started to show wear, and today, for example, his recovering that ball from Lamela was wonderful to see.

Besic is raw and takes chances and he started off his everton campaign with a huge mistake and for that reason I feel that people are starting to place blame on him. In defense today, for example, I thought timmy was way worse.

###Gerrard's Contract

&gt;Steven Gerrard and his representatives have been offered a contract here and at this moment in time thats where it's at.

&gt;For Steven, everything hes done in the period of time hes been here, for 16 years, is a man who deserves utmost respect and time to consider that. It's not just a big move in his life in terms of commitment but needs time and respect to look at that.

&gt;It certainly won't be money. I've spoken to him enough times at length and that won't be the case. Between now and the end of the season he deserves the opportunity to think.

###Rift between him and Gerrard

&gt;No. 150% no.

###Squad

&gt;It takes time. There's a lot of players that have come in and it takes time to adjust. They're good players deemed to help the club over coming years - and now - but the group is very much together.

&gt;Of course players want to play, when they get the chance they have to take it. Squad is very focused and committed includes new signings coming in and adapting to playing for one of the biggest squads in the world.

###Lucas

&gt;Steven was a player who could orchestrate attacks from deep, with the players we had up front, his quality could exploit that.

&gt;The dynamic up front has changed so I have to think of a restructure so we look at a different type of midfielder to come in.

&gt;Lucas is aggressive but can also attack. Ludogorets, Stoke, he's been excellent. It's been a great credit to him and hi s professionalism.

I heard you talking to Clara the other day and ask her “Am I a good Man?” Sorry about eavesdropping on your conversation. I couldn’t help it.

Remember that time when you were in your own time stream trying to save Clara and you said “The name I chose is “The Doctor”. The name you choose, it’s like a promise you make”? Even greatest of the doctors have their bad days. They have days when they fail to save a life or two. There are days when things are out of their control and beyond anyone’s imagination.

You, my dearest Doctor, might be a Time Lord in its most absolute form. But that does not mean that you are not bounded by the rules of the nature and universe. There’s a limit to your powers and madness as well.
You stood by the promise you made in your name for thousands of years trying to save humanity and other universe from some of its most disastrous events and succeeded.  Remember those times, Doctor.

You flew into our world in an Old Blue box you called T.A.R.D.I.S with a faulty console and navigation system. You made it your home. You traveled across the universe from the beginning to end.  Saw it blossoming and saw it burn. You’ve seen it all. You faced off against some of the worst that this universe had to offer and stood your ground proud and tall. You took the best this universe had to offer and turned it into something even better.

When you ask “Am I a good Man?” think about all those moments. All those lives you have saved. Think about all those planets that are still standing because of you, all those stars that still light the night sky with their bright light. Remember those faces that light up at the slightest sound of your T.A.R.D.I.S. Think of all those companions you’ve had over the years and how you shared some of the most incredible adventures with them. Remember those days when you were their only hope. Not to mention all those people who would willingly sacrifice themselves just to save you at the drop of a word from your mouth. Remember all those bad people who turned into good because of you.

Dearest Doctor, we have fought monsters together. We have seen the greatest artist of human kind do his magic with our own eyes. We have rebooted the universe together. We have fought against The Daleks, The Cybermen and The Weeping Angels. We have had some of the weirdest of dreams and greatest of adventures together.

Never for a second doubt yourself Doctor. You’re undoubtedly one of the greatest man I’ve had the pleasure of knowing.

I heard you changed your face again. It will take you a while to get adjusted to it. Believe me. I’ve seen it firsthand. No matter how you look, how you sound or act, you’ll always be my Doctor.  

A lady once told some bad people,
&gt; “Night will fall and drown the sun, when a good man goes to war”.

There will always be darkness Doctor. It’s in your hands to shine the light and make things better.

Go on. Be The Doctor I knew. Be The Doctor I trusted, loved and respected. Be the man you were born to be. Be the man who will make those old faces lit up with a smile. Go on Doctor. Be who you are.

You are the “best” a man can ever dream of and try to be.

Love
Your Mother-In-Law.",false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,null,null,self,Am I a good Man ?,0,http://www.reddit.com/r/doctorwho/comments/2nxjqg/am_i_a_good_man/

I thought the way in which Poche had the guys set up was crucial to our performance and how we won the match.

it seemed to flow something like this:

| State  | ""strategy""    |
|:-----------|:------------|
| Spurs in possession | Full backs up, holding Mids pivoting |
| Ev in possession, thier half | back 2, FB in line with Holding mids, FW and wingers pressing |
| Ev in possession, our half | 2 clean banks of 4, FWs up for counter |

it wasn't that simple of course but that's how it looked, and the transition between pressing and closing up to 2x4 depending on where Everton were seemed quite effective. 

Eriksen definitely was the most unfamiliar with the role - always the last to get back into the LW place of the front 4, but even then I thought he did well and played a much better defensive game than he has the rest of the season. 

I was very impressed in the wing/FB play that often drove us forward after recovering possession after an attack and also having Soldado and Harry up deep putting pressure on Everton from potential counters.

I was really impressed today, not so much from the performances - although Soldado's and Eriksens goals were great and Harry was excellent, but rather the team work that everyone displayed out there. It looked coherent. And even when the subs Dier/Lamela/Paulinho came on the cohesion continued. Was brilliant to see and not something I have seen ever in the last 2-3 years of spurs watching.

Loved watching this game, and will be interested to see it it is how we line up against the better teams in the league or how Poche develops us next.

We are on 11 points (on just home form as things stand today - 01.12.14 we are 7th in the league) at the moment.Our away fixtures have also been very difficult at the start of the season: Spurs, Man Utd, Southampton (who we gave a run for their money), West Ham, Chelsea (Ditto like the saints) &amp; Newcastle have been tough as old boots. All bang in form teams (except for Spurs) and apart from Man City/Arsenal probably the best the league has to offer. 

I don't see it as impossible that we could get something from Swansea, Everton or Arsenal. Both Everton (Leicester) and Arsenal (Hull &amp; Leicester) have slipped up this season against teams like us and therefore we could pick up a few points.

After the Christmas period is over we have a string of quite average teams to play away, starting with Burnley,Stoke &amp; Sunderland and only occasionally coming across a top 7 side.

So what I'm trying to say is the Christmas period is very important (for points but also for who will come into the team in January and moral) but I think just as important is improving away form. 

If we can maintain home form, away form will be the decider of whether we stay in this league or are relegated. We have got all our points from home games this season and if we had drawn even two of those games instead of losing them we join 13th (on points) now and in the media's eyes that's a million miles away from 18th. 

Really to be on track by the new year we need to be on about 19 (round about half of 40 points, ie probably safe). So out of 6 games we've got to get 7 points.

TLDR: Our away form isn't as bad as it looks, all our away games have been against in-form teams (top 7). If we can improve this Christmas/and afterwards will look a lot easier.

Looking at the table today, one thing really stands out to me: If we had beaten Southampton a few months back, we would be in 3rd now. I know, it is easy to say ""if this, then that"" but the fact is, we went a goal up in that game and then stopped playing, We could have won that game.



Right or wrong, I do compare our performance with theirs. We came up in the same year and at the time, I really didn't like them at all. There were many posts on KUMB. highlighting some of their threads and they were very cocky about how good they were and how terrible we were. It seemed that since Pompeys demise, we had become their new #1 target for hate. How they gloated, when we were being criticised for playing route 1 football, while they were getting praised for playing like Barcelona. Admittedly, my dislike of them has subsided a bit, especially once Adkins left, and I have to say, I do quite like watching them now. I even want them to finish quite high, as it is nice to have new teams up there. Plus, I have Tadic, Pelle and Clyne in my fantasy team.


However, I really don't want them to finish ahead of us. And I think that it is possible that we will finish ahead of them this year, I watched them yesterday v Man City and even with a man less, City always looked comfortable. Saints were nothing like the team that the papers made them out to be. I had a look through some of their past fixtures and it struck me that they have had quite an easy start to the season. The only other 'big' team they played before yesterday was Spurs, and they lost that 1-0. That is not to say that they aren't a good team and they play nice football, but we had a harder fixture list thus far. If that one game had a different result, maybe we would be getting all the praise. I still think we can finish above them though and, remembering some of the crap they talked about us in recent years, that would be very very sweet.





EDIT: Just to be clear, I don't mean that I am saying we will finish 3rd and them in 4th. I am more talking about us finishing 7th and them in 8th. I am not the sort to overreact after a few good results, I have supported this team too long to be fooled easily by good results. My main point here is that I am wondering if, when this season is finished, is it possible we can finish ahead of a side that everyone is raving about. In my opinion, yes we can, because we are a solid team and can play tough when needed, whereas Saints are primarily a flair side. Against City, we showed a steel and didn't try to beat them by trying to pass it around them. We were solid and fought hard.

##Voice of Rodgers
________________

""What has been pleasing in the last couple of games is that the steel and determination has returned to the team - that gives you a great platform to build your fluency and football.""

##Voice of the Opposition
________________

""Consequently we come away with nothing, and that remains very frustrating for us, because all in all from our performance, we deserved more. We have to make sure we go again on Tuesday.”

##Expected line-up
________________

                   Mignolet

      Johnson - Skrtel - Toure - Enrique

                    Lucas

           Gerrard - Henderson - Allen            
       
               Sterling 

                        Lambert

         
With a game against Sunderland this weekend and a must-win game against Basel next week, Brenden will need to consider his line-up and substitutions carefully in this game. Having found a core of experienced, reliable players to grind out good performances, he may want to stick with the team that beat Stoke 1-0 at home so that the team can be rotated for the home game at Sunderland this weekend, keeping key players fit for the Basel game. 

Lambert has played 270 minutes in the space of a week, and may struggle for fitness so soon after the weekend. However, he is in a rich vein of form, scoring 2 of his last 3 games and unluckily hitting the crossbar against Stoke (which lead to Glen Johnson's winner). Rodgers has a big decision to make on whether to start him or tap into the squad for Borini, Liverpool's only other fit senior striker.

Having used Gerrard as a sub at the weekend, he is expected to start with Lucas, the subject of Rodger's praise in the pre-match presser, alongside him in midfield. We may see a return to the formation used against Ludogorets with Gerrard playing as a number 10. Allen, Henderson and Sterling are all fit and expected to start.

Toure may retain his place after his performances this week, alongside Skrtel, who remains preferred to Lovren. Johnson's excellent performance against Stoke will see him likely rewarded with another start (but no new contract it seems) and Enrique and Moreno will compete for the LB spot. 

Rodgers will stick with Mignolet in goal, after his improved showing against Stoke.

## Opposition analysis
____________________

Leicester City have lost 5 of their last 6 games, the other game being a goalless draw against Sunderland at home. In this run of form they have scored only twice (both against QPR this weekend) and have conceded 9 goals. They sit bottom of the league with 2 wins in 13 games. 

Leicester's performances have cooled off after Ulloa's run of form (5 goals in their first 5 fixtures) ended, and they are in danger of free-falling into the new year. A quick and industrious side, James Vardy is exemplary in this respect. 

Nigel Pearson will likely set up his team in a 4-4-2 or 4-3-3, with Ulloa, Nugent and Vardy to choose from to lead the line. Mahrez had a good game against QPR at the weekend and will start in midfield. Cambiasso, James and Schlupp may complete the midfield in Hammond's absence. Full backs are former United youth Richie de Laet and former Red Paul Konchesky. Wasilewski and Morgan are the preferred CB pairing recently, though Moore may return to partner Morgan.

While in a major funk, Leicester's performance against QPR at the weekend will give them some confidence, particularly now that they have remembered how to score goals. Cambiasso's early opener was their first goal in 570 minutes, dating back to early October - almost two months. A defensively shaky Liverpool at home may be perfect for them to gain a huge scalp and get their season back on track. 
  
## Stat Attack
____________________

Glen Johnson, game winner at the weekend against Stoke, and Jordan Henderson, Vice Captain and ever present since Rodgers joined the club, are both in line to make their 150th league outing for the club.

City have lost just once – a 1-0 defeat to West Brom in early November – in six games at King Power Stadium. 

The Reds' last meeting with the Foxes was away from home in March 2004, when the two teams played out a goalless stalemate.

The Reds have lost four of their last six road trips in the top flight (W2 D0 L4).

Liverpool have kept just one clean sheet in their last 10 Premier League away games.

The Reds have already lost four Premier League away games this term; the same number they lost on the road last season and just one fewer than they suffered in 2012/13, Brendan Rodgers’ first campaign at the helm (5).

Leonardo Ulloa scored five goals in his first five Premier League appearances, but has failed to score in the eight games since in the competition for the Foxes.

Leicester have not failed to score in three consecutive home league games since March 2008, and have not done so in the top-flight since September 1983.

No side has a top scorer with fewer goals than Liverpool (Raheem Sterling, 3 goals) in the Premier League this season (Aston Villa’s and Stoke’s top scorers also have three goals).

I have combination acne-prone skin, for which I use the Neutrogena Visibly Clear cleanser, and while it's helping with redness and blackheads, I'm having an influx of dry skin.

I've been using the Sebamed Clear Face gel as moisturiser, and while it's fine on my cheeks, forehead and nose, around my chin (where most of the acne is) it's falling short. It's hormonal acne, and I think the dry skin is actually causing some of the smaller spots.

I tried using NipFabs Glycolic Cleanser, but it broke me out in places I NEVER get breakouts, so I came to the conclusion that it just wasn't a good fit.

Is this an exfoliating problem, or a moisturising problem? I've been using FadeOut day cream with lactic acid, in the hope that it would have some kind of AHA effect, but it hasn't! I've ordered some of the Stridex Max Strength pads, but they have yet to arrive.

On top of all this, he has the perfect football IQ for a striker. His positioning and awareness are outstanding, and you honestly feel like all the midfield needs to do is just get the ball *in his vicinity* for him to make something to happen.

I really liked Mason and Bentaleb in midfield together against Everton, but I feel like there may not be quite the defensive strength to deal with a team with the strength of Chelsea. So I'd probably bring in Dembele as someone with a bit more physicality.  
  
As far as I'm aware Naughton should be done with his suspension so  I'd bring him in at RB.   
  
I think Kane looked knackered at the end of Everton, so I'd probably stick him on the bench. Think Soldado may have been taken off early specifically to rest him a little for this game.   
  
If I'm benching Kane then I'd probably shift Eriksen back to the middle and play Chadli out left.  
  
The only position I'm not sure who I'd play in is RM. Lennon should probably start, but his injury record makes me worry about playing him too often...

Say for example you have rich parents, and they have a home worth £5m. They are in their 80s and so want to make sure everything is sorted for when they pass away. One day they say to you 'Oh hey bob, as you will of course inherit our house once we pass away, what do you think of us changing the ownership of this house to your name now? That way you can keep it all for yourself instead of paying inheritance tax.'

Now how many of you would honestly reply to that 'Oh no I'm fine keep it in your name. I'd rather pay £100,000s of tax instead'.

Fair enough if you honestly would pay the tax, but otherwise if you'd take the first option then frankly you have no right to shame people who legally avoid paying tax.

I put in a lot of effort and I have improved although my boss still isnt putting me on more days. my problem is with the minimial working days and the cost of travel- as well as that I only get paid every 4 weeks, means this job is hurting me financially. Also with the fact that my working days and hours change on a week-by-week basis, which makes it hard to arrange interviews with job offers and stuff. I just called in to rearrange a day of work today so that i could go to an interview for a job which turned out to be not what was advertised (and I was pretty much told I didn't get the job), I don't want to keep calling in to rearrange days if i'm going to be going through the process of looking for another job and possibly being unsuccesful in numurous interviews.
I was thinking about quitting my job but this and claiming jsa temporarily but I was told I would be sanctioned 14 weeks for leaving a job voluntarily- my contract is a 15 hour a week one minimum even though my boss initially agreed to give me 5 day weeks, so he is still in his legal right. Even going out and searching for jobs is difficult as the small amount of money i'm now getting barely covers travel and food, so if I could sign on to jsa for a few weeks while I was job hunting this would be ideal.

What do I need to know as an American moving to England? 

Which cell phone service should I switch to? Currently have us t-mobile but contract won't transfer. (Even through UK version of t-mobile)

We're transporting a Nissan. The warranty won't apply but what else should we know about owning an American car in England? Besides driving on the left side of the road. :p

Thinking about renting a house or flat in fairford area so my husband and I will be close to base. What do you recommend?  

We're a young couple. Early 20s so we like to have fun. What should we get into while stationed there?

This is rather strange. I received an email from the Leeds United ticket office about an hour ago confirming my purchase of tickets for the 13/12/14 match against Fulham.

Unfortunately, I live in North Carolina and it appears Leeds has sent this info to the wrong guy. Care to help a yank out and help me find this Leeds fan?

I would assume maybe he and I share the same name, that being Spencer Bland. I have his home address, however I don't want to post it online. Instead, I'll post the ticket info and perhaps we can track this guy down.

Then i made the mistake of calling the useless fucks at HSBC. Oh god was THAT a bad decision. So my debit card is expiring at the end of Dec. They sent me a replacement back on the 1st of  Nov ... to an address I haven't lived at for 10 years. So i told them this 4 weeks ago, fixed my address with them etc, and nothing.


Still no sign of a card, so i called them again today. Fixed address again. Then for some batshit reason they decide to cancel the whole thing including my current card and issue a new one. 4-6 working days at least without a card. Right as it's xmas fucking present buying time. Cunts. Nothing they can do, cant make it faster. 

I made a complaint to them via twitter and they are investigating. No fucking chance they'll resolve it, I reckon. Oh dont worry, i'll just cancel christmas for everyone since I cant order anything now. Twats.


Then, to top it off I get dragged into a 5 min meeting with senior director bloke to explain how/why I cocked up a thing at work last week. Could have had major impact, didn't. Meh, whatever, done.

Then I get dragged into another meeting directly with my boss to have the same fucking conversation. Oh yay, this is looking wonderful. 

Despite the fact I'm leaving in 38 days time, I suspect there's a chance i'll get pulled into an actual HR disciplinary for that. There's too much company politics going on - 2 senior managers in new roles both itching to prove how fucking awesome them are at getting shit sorted out, and a whole tunnel of shit i'm staring upwards at as it creeps my way. Cunts can fuck right off ,waste of everyone's cocking time. 


Manage to get to leave an hour early so I can go to the bank and try and get cash, and because fuck work anyway. No chance, make it to the still open branch of HSBC, too bored ladies in there tell me the counter closed at 5pm and i'm fucked. Well THANKS FOR LISTING THAT ON YOUR STORE LOCATOR YOU CUNTS. Trudge onwards.

Go over the road, get a tenner out on credit card just to prove i know the pin. Get charged fucking £3 or whatever bullshit credit card fee it is for doing so, call it a memory tax.


Go to London Bridge station to go home, oh what a fucking suprise, its a) packed full of idiots with no idea what a fucking train is nevermind how to get one and b) the trains are all fucked.
Finally get one that looks like its escaping death only via generous use of WD40 and [speed tape](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speed_tape) that trundles in the direction of my house, 30 mins after i got to the station. 


Walk up the largest bastard hill to exist in the world of bastard hills and buy a fuckton of junk food at sainsburys because fuck today in its fucking face. Struggle home with it all, get in, press light switch, nothing happens. Out of cunting electricity credit again, fucking houselord, he's supposed to deal with this shit. Lazy twat shoulda had a meter put in years ago. Fuck around with sorting that out and triggering the emergency £5 it gives you so I can actually see a god damn shitting thing.

-Ulster Rugby. Yeah so Ulster rugby team is well liked down here. I know that it has counties in the republic but its a mainly northern thing. I remember Rory Best breaking his arm and staying on like the hardy bastard he is, Trimble is sound and humble from whenever I hear about, Bowe is bowe. 
As well stuff like letting Gaelic football match being played a few weeks ago are tiny things but it still shows how much people have matured and not psychos.  Good feels all round.

-Lots of golfer cunts.

-Northerners are perceived as madder drivers for some reason. 

-Belfast. I was talking to mates and Belfast has gotten the reputation as *the* place to go out in Ireland. Dublin is too dear, Cork is a bit boring, Limerick a little dodgy, Galway is class but Belfast is a place that is a major European city with cheap pints and good vibes. Also for some reason its a music hub (may be wrong)? anecdotal evidence but a few friends and friends of friends have moved to Belfast for music gigs and electro-music stuff. 

-GoT, I know its small thing, but a lot of people are scratching their heads on why we missed out but it shows how ye are becoming genuine competitors in tourism and I've been to Derry, a serious city with unreal history, a class fuckin wall and hilly as fuck.

-Politics- fuck the arseholes, the real people I've talked to or seen on this are all level headed normal, not a load of deranged psychos. 90% of the convo on this sub is sensible enough from what I can see. Don't let the minority depress ye, youth will win eventually, ye will emigrate for a few years like everyone else then come back and the place will get better. Things have moved on already.

I have around £30k in accounts, and whilst I'm moving it to take advantage of the best savings accounts out there (Santander 123 account), I'm thinking long-term that property is the best option.

Naturally, that sort of money would be great for a deposit on when I want to settle down, but I'm not at the stage in my career where I know this is where I will be.

So I'm wondering about Buy-to-let. I'm not sure if this is the right place to ask, so apologies if this isn't right, but for a while I've been eager to get on the ladder asap, but today I had a brainwave that it may not actually be the best thing for my money.

I've been looking at flats in the center of town and something half-decent is around £100-125k depending on whether its 1 or 2 bedrooms. So I'd have a mortgage for buying to let, but repayment rather than interest only, taking out 4-5% (this is of course assuming I could get a mortgage). For around £700 rent, £4-500 would go on the mortgage payments, then another £100-£150 on the ground rent, which wouldn't leave me a lot left over by the end going on those numbers.

So, for one of my graduate psychology courses, we were given a project to illustrate how memory works according to a theory of our choosing. It was an open-ended project, we were given free reign to design it any way we want, soooo I decided to use the TARDIS. Specifically, I illustrated how a function of the TARDIS can be used as a metaphor for the process of memory.

This poster was done by me. I got all the pictures off the internet, but I drew the POLICE BOX myself with crayon.

For the psychology-inclined/those interested: I decided to follow the classic modal model by Atkinson &amp; Schiffrin, the one that basically says that human memory works like computers. So when the TARDIS lands, it intakes all of the temporal-environmental information within a 1,000-mile radius (sensory information).

It was an open-ended project, we were given free reign to design it any way we want, soooo I decided to use the TARDIS. Specifically, I illustrated how a function of the TARDIS can be used as a metaphor for the process of memory.

This poster was done by me. I got all the pictures off the internet, but I drew the POLICE BOX myself with crayon.

For the psychology-inclined/those interested: I decided to follow the classic modal model by Atkinson &amp; Schiffrin, the one that basically says that human memory works like computers. So when the TARDIS lands, it intakes all of the temporal-environmental information within a 1,000-mile radius (sensory information). Then, the TARDIS analyzes the information (short-term memory, encoding), stores it for later usage (long-term memory), and uses the Chameleon Circuit to decide which exterior would be best based on the information gathered (retrieval).

I'm a dual US/EU (LT) citizen but haven't lived in the EU since I was little and was born in the US. I'm trying to apply to UK universities as an international/US student. 

For grades 9-11 I went to a physical, actual brick and mortar school. Now, I'm in 12th grade and going to an online school. I don't think we have a counselor here, but I contacted one of my teachers about it. I looked up a bunch of stuff online and it is incredibly overwhelming.

I should mention I took 3 AP classes, and my grades were A, A, B for first semester and A, A, D for second semester. However, my ACT score is very very very *VERY* low, so I think I shouldn't even submit it. I also didn't take the AP tests due to family related issues at the time. However, my grades from 9-11 were almost all A's, with lots of honors classes in grades 9-10 (we could only take AP classes junior year). I was ranked 20/40th out of 460 or so students for most of my time there. At the online school I'm currently attending, there are no honors/AP classes, it's mostly pass/fail. 

I want to go to the UK to study abroad so that I can teach English in Japan/South Korea afterwards. I can take out federal and private US loans to pay for university in the UK, but I want to know which major I should pick (business or English? maybe history?) and which universities I can easily get into (aka the least selective ones for international students). Or anyone I can contact for help? I'm in the process of reaching out to universities and UCAS now, but everything is still really complicated and overwhelming, so any help is appreciated.

In my mind, I saw it much like Star Trek, in that both shows have a mythology and a history that spans decades.  And since I adore Star Trek, I thought I would similarly like Doctor Who.

But I think, maybe, that I thought Doctor Who was something else.  There was one episode in the third season where the Doctor turned himself human and escaped to just before WWI England to hide from some aliens.  While there, he fell in love with a human, and one of the reasons he didn't want to change back into being a Time Lord was because (I guess) he wanted a wife and a family, and he as the Time Lord Doctor couldn't have that.

And I don't understand that, nor do I understand the Doctor's... purpose.  As I understand it, he's like a... time tourist, or time adventurer. Sure, he'll help people if he sees them in trouble, but he doesn't seek out tragedy so he can stop it.  But I guess I heard the term ""Time Lord"" and thought his job was to protect... something, like the time stream, or the universe or something.  But it doesn't seem like he has any job at all.

So if he's just popping around time and space, being a ""looky-loo,"" if you will, why can't he have a family?  And in my mind, of course he can.  He just doesn't want one.  So his protestations in that episode I was referring to, the idea that the ""Doctor"" couldn't have a family - I don't understand it.

I get that he lives a long time (basically immortal?).  That doesn't mean he can't have a wife for as long as she might live.  Sure, it would be painful to lose her when she died, but he seems to go through companions pretty quickly anyway.

And what's the deal with all his companions falling in love with him?  Is that true of classic Dr Who, or is this a recent thing?  Sarah Jane was in love with him, Rose was in love with him, and even poor second-choice Martha was in love with him.  I get that he's the Doctor and so apparently awesome, but it's a little creepy/weird/sad that all these women fall in love with him and he can't or won't be in love with them.

I guess I just thought there would be more of a purpose to his traveling.  I mean, yes - he's an explorer, and I suppose that could be his purpose, just like the people of Star Trek are explorers.  But the difference is, the people in Star Trek *share* their discoveries with the larger community they live in.  In Star Trek, people explore and hope to improve themselves and the universe they live in.  

The Doctor seems to keep everything to himself.  Yes, he has the occasional companion, but still, that's just one or two people.  And I get the sense that they're not supposed to talk about what they see to the community at large.

I thought there would be a philosophy to Doctor Who, some sort of lesson that we could learn.  Instead, the show seems to be about him stopping various alien invasions of Earth.  And that's fine, but where's the lesson?

I don't know if I'm making any sense.  Maybe I thought it was going to be a little bit more science-fiction, and it turned out to be more fantasy, and that's why I'm disappointed.  That's not to say that there aren't episodes that I really enjoyed.  The weeping angels one was really good, and I also liked the season finale of season 3.  (I'm kind of glad that Martha left him, instead of the other way around.  While I'll miss her, I liked her showing her backbone.)

It's also possible that the rapid change of actors and actresses in the show inhibits my ability to connect with the characters.  I'm used to American shows where the same actors play the same character for 7 seasons.  It takes me 4 or 5 episodes to get used to a new Doctor or companion, and then they go and replace one of them, and I have to start all over.

I don't know what I'm looking for here - whether it's advice to keep watching, or a recommendation to ""cut my losses"".  I would ask that you not spoil anything from the 4th series on, as I still might continue to watch the show.",false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,null,null,self,"So I just finished watching the third season of the ""new"" Doctor Who, and I'm wondering if I'm missing something.

  Being a smart sort of chap, I do have an external with a lot of my music saved onto it, but I also lost a fair amount as well as most pics etc. That kind of sucks, but it's a lesson I have now learned.   
  
  Anyways, I was poking around in the attic on Sunday looking for the Christmas tree, decs, lights (ho ho ho the motherfucking tangle) and I came across a whole box full of old, shit and mostly borked phones, you know the ones I'm talking about, cracked screens, ones with the messed up headphone socked, and the one with the menu button missing.  
  
  So anyways, in one of them, I found a 16gb SD card. This morning, just before I decanted myself out into the cold, I gingerly plugged it into my phone and wondered what embarrassing shit I'd find on there.  
  
  Oh. My. God. I hit dubstep and drum n bass gold.  
  
  A whole bunch of albums, singles, mixes that I'd pretty much forgotten about that I hadn't even previously remembered *existed* so I spent the majority of the train journey in this morning grinning like a complete idiot. So, that kind of made my morning, and will probably make the rest of my week.

I noticed this in the game against Hull and also against Everton. Each time a ball was destined to reach Mason, he'd always have a quick look up and then touch the ball.

Another question is regardin melwood. I read a lot in a forum that no way you can enter Melwood which is normal but the best time to maybe get lucky to get a signature would be going at 12-1 after noon and maybe get lucky for the players to stop and sign. It would be just amazing for me seeing them pass by and that would make my trip.

Missed delivery yesterday, arranged redelivery today, he didn't even knock, just shoved a 'while you were out' card through again! I phoned DHL who contacted the driver and apparently he's insisting that he did knock which is odd because I've been sat 5ft from the door all morning!  Funny thing is, I was in yesterday in bed and I never heard anyone knock, I thought I was awake at the time on the card (9:10am) but I assumed I must have dozed off for 10 minutes to miss it (I work lates so don't usually rise until 9am or so anyway). 

BUT ALSO! This is the second time this has happened! Last time I ordered Dipbrow from net-a-porter I missed the first delivery because he didn't knock, so arranged redelivery and he still didn't knock and just left a card. I don't understand why he isn't knocking?!?! 

I phoned DHL and they contacted him and he's saying he did knock, but I'm 100% sure he didn't, we have two doors and you can clearly hear both of them when someone knocks and I was fully prepared to answer the door today. They said he can't come back today as he's loaded up with parcels to delivery, but surely **if he just knocked** he would have unloaded a huge parcel saving space and time for future deliveries (I also ordered some boots but this is MUAUK so let's just focus on the Dipbrow!).

So it means waiting a week for my next day off to get them again.  I can't believe it's happened twice! I've complained to DHL and emailed net-a-porter suggesting they use someone else. I purposely didn't put my eyebrows on this morning in anticipation of my new brush, now I'm too pissed off to even bother with eyebrows at all!

When I asked how I'm supposed to know about it, she replied that it has been in place since the mid 1970's. The problem is, these fields are open, people walk their dogs on their and have done for as long as I have known. The field has always been well respected and I don't understand why now, it would become an issue. There have never been any signs posted up about anything law or fine related Their are a couple of bins on the field. There have been sporting events, music events, camping club meetings and all sorts.

So I currently work for a UK company and reside in the UK. My tax is paid through PAYE on my payslip. I am due to move to LA and work for a US company in March.

But you go from traffic and concrete into a really nice traditional pub, it's pretty incredible considering where it is, lovely old place. 

The atmosphere is nice, the people are the sort of people I like to talk to, they play the sort of music I like and they have a good ale selection.

The only thing is, I feel like I'm not wanted there! The people are friendly generally, but the landlord seems to go out of his way to make me uncomfortable without being impolite. I'm pretty sure it's because of my age, I'm 19 and it's a bit of an olde timey place, but that's the kind of atmosphere I enjoy. I've spent a lot of my time at blacksmiths festivals talking to exactly that kind of person, and to be honest, I can more easily hold a conversation with them than a person my age who I don't know. I'm really into trad music too, so the place is just perfect for me. 

But yeah, what's the best way for me to 'fit in' to a new pub? I've been there a few times with mates and just take a table and chat, but going in alone isn't too enjoyable! Obviously I'm pretty new to the pub scene, so I've never exactly made a friend with a stranger there before!

It all sounds quite pathetic I know, but in my view, it's worth the effort, I felt like I was at home when somebody took me in there a while back!",false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,null,null,self,Fitting into a pub,37,http://www.reddit.com/r/AskUK/comments/2o1pcu/fitting_into_a_pub/

Anyway - here is my question: How do you guys feel about the difference in our own and United's transfer window went? There are only what, 4 points or so between us? They seem to be picking up steam and yet really on paper, they should be  the ones who are still fucked from the Moyes days and slashing out on forwards whilst having a shit tonne of defensive injuries. We had, what we thought was, a calm, well prepared transfer window with it all out the way.

If you could swap out some transfers, would you take off Lovren and perhaps Moreno and instead take on a world class forward? That would leave us with a fullback problem as Flanno is still injured and Skrtel / Sakho(who has been out) Toure etc.

In my eyes it's short term gain with no long term stability. But you'd have to weigh  up how you feel about nearly £40million going on Lovren and Sakho.

I know this post will not be liked by most.  Hear me out.

We are on a decent run at the moment.  We are going to chelsea, and they are coming off of a frustrating draw.  There is nothing that we can do better than park the bus, frustrate them more, and maybe...just maybe...catch them on a counter.  

Getting a point and coming back with that would do wonders for our player's confidence.  Drawing against the league leaders.

From there we can say that we took 7 points from three games that included Chelsea, and we have a relatively soft spot on our upcoming schedule.  Its all about confidence moving forward.  

I fear that as well as we have been playing over the last week or so, we would go into chelsea thinking 3 points, and getting reamed 3 or 4 goals...and confidence gone.

He will arrive on a Friday and leave Sunday. The passes are 7 days minimum so I'm thinking about pay as you go.  
If I understand well, for buses, you get to pay £1.40 every time you board a bus but if you do it four times or more, the day limit is £4.40. It means that if I put £20 on the card, it will be enough for the three days and we even will be able to take the tube once or twice.

The gardening company has been paying me cash.

I have recently applied for another job and on my application I put that I have been working part time for said gardening company because I was afraid that they would frown upon such a large gap in employment and it isn't a complete lie, I have done some work for the company and it wasn't full time..  They have offered me the job, on the condition that my DBS check comes back OK, which it should.

I am now worried that I have fucked up.  If they look into my tax records they will see no record of me working. I realise that I should have been declaring what I earned, but it was well below the tax threshold and I wasn't on benefits so it didn't seem to matter at first, I got lazy and never got around to doing it. 

Will this fuck up my new job?  They are expecting me to do 1 week of unpaid training and pay for my own DBS search so if I go through all of that and don't secure the job at the end I will be quite out of pocket. What are the chances that they will try to check my tax records to confirm my employment history?  If they do so and see I haven't paid any tax, how fucked am I?

There are a couple of other factors which are slightly unusual. I'm really struggling with the whole pension thing. I know about the tax advantages and the advantages from the government matching that mean you can get substantially more for your investment in a pension than other equivalents. However, at my age I won't be able to access the pension til I'm 58. I work in the tech industry and (without going into too many details) expect to get a payout from a project I have equity in equivalent to 500k+ in the next 6 months or so. I don't want to dump that into something I won't see for 20 years and I would like to be in a position to be financially independant by the time I'm 50. 

Let's say I can afford to save around 3-4k per month and I have (circa) 500k to use as a lump sum to build on. 

If I go down the pension route in 20 years I would have 900k - 1.25m in the pension pot. 

If I save 3-4k per month for the next 12 years I'll have around ~500k + my 500ish = ~1 million pounds. 

What if I build the investment portfolio of that 1m to a level where it returns ~4% per annum (£40k per year before tax). With a mortgage paid off that would be sufficient income for me to live happily. I would continue to work, this would just be ongoing passive income until I decided to fully retire.

My questions to you are: ""am I mad to think this way?"". ""Should I just suck up the pension pill and accept that I'll have to wait til I'm 58 to get at the money?"". ""What would you do if you were me?"".

I will be consulting a financial advisor but was interested to know what /r/UKPersonalFinance thought.

It's the point in the season where both players have proved themselves (not their full potential mind) and Poch has a decision to make. Not that he can't change his mind the next week....

But seriously, this has been an interesting competition for me all year and I finally have my way with Davies in at the moment.

I personally just think Davies is all round better. I think he's far more composed not only at the back but going forward. Though Danny has improved his defence massively. I think Rose is absolutely diabolical going forward, and I do not use that word lightly. Davies has anything but set the world alight going forward but he's been consistently effective, able to do a job/role each game and hold it.

I do hate Rose, and I do like Davies, but I like to think I can give a fair analysis. For me Davies seems to be working a little harder, and care a little bit more than Rose, that may be because Davies is fighting for his place but to me Rose looks fairly complacent. Hopefully they both keep raising each others game.

What does everyone think? Do we think it's decision time for Poch given  Davies has seized his chance while Rose has been injured/banned?",false,coys,t5_2ryq7,null,null,self,Davies vs Rose?,0,http://www.reddit.com/r/coys/comments/2o25d1/davies_vs_rose/

It's come to the time when I need to write my personal statement and although I'm normally good at formal writing, I'm really struggling to get going with this.

Basically I left school at the end of 5th year (so I'm currently missing the last year) since I managed to get the grades I wanted (AAAAB) and to be honest, I couldn't really be arsed with another year of school

Problem is since then I've really not been doing much at all, I'm not able to search for a job until the new year since I'll be on holiday during Christmas so I don't really have much to write about on my statement.

**I think my grades and references will be good enough to get into most unis(wanting to do either Artificial Intelligence or Neuroscience)although I'm really keen to do something at Glasgow but I know they have standards and it's not going to look good if I've just chilled for a year after school**

So what can I possibly say I've been doing for the last few months?

Is it possible just to make my way through this by saying I've been doing lots of sports and wider reading?

Are extra curricular activities that important as long as my statement is written well?

**Match Score:**  
Aston Villa **1**  
Crystal Palace **0**


___
**Match Events:**   
**0 Min'** Teams are out, Villa get the first half under way.  
**1 Min'** First free kick of the game, Gayle pulls at the shirt of Okore as he tries to shadow the ball out of play.  
**2 Min'** Early corner for Palace, from a throw after some good work from Zaha.  
**4 Min'** [](#icon-offside) Bolasie has a shot from outside the box, Guzan drops it at the feet of Gayle. Clark gets to the ball just as its crossing the line. Gayle is given offside.  
**5 Min'** Zaha goes down in the box, under pressure it looks soft and nothing is given.  
**8 Min'** Unfortunate for [](#icon-subout-arrow) Cole he's off with an injury for [](#icon-subin-arrow) Sanchez  
**10 Min'** Villa just can't get into the game, Crystal Palace are throwing themselves forward in attack.  
**14 Min'** Ball into the Villa box from almost the half way line, Cissokho leaves it and the bounce almost catches Guzan out.  
**15 Min'** Okore shows off his pace, ball over the top sees him in a foot race with Gayle. He beats the Palace man to the ball and wins a free kick.  
**17 Min'** Sanchez goes for it from 30 yards out, I think it might have hit row Z.  
**20 Min'** Jedinak puts back heel towards goal, from a corner. Luckily for Villa it lacks power and Guzan easily collects.  
**22 Min'** Villa with a period of possession, but just can't get it passed the half way line.  
**24 Min'** Villa free kick won by Bentekem is put in by Westwood and eventually cleared, to put Palace on the break. Zaha wastes the opportunity with an over hit cross, for a Villa throw.  
**27 Min'** Benteke turns Dann on the edge of the box, his effort is heading for the top corner. Speroni manages to get a finger tip to the ball, and push it out for a corner.  
**29 Min'** The Palace wingers definelty have the beating of the Villa fullbacks at the moment.  
**31 Min'** [](#icon-football) BENTEKE!!!! Dann gets caught on the ball by Benteke, he drives towards goal and bends the ball into the bottom corner.  
**33 Min'** Palace go on the hunt for the equaliser with three shots in quick succession, the most dangerous of the three coming from Zaha. Guzan made sure he was equal to it and keeps it 1-0.  
**34 Min'** It should be 1-1, Zaha gets the ball into Balosie, he has to score but he hits his half volley straight at the chest of Guzan.  
**40 Min'** Zaha looks threatening until it comes to making the cross, he's causing all sorts of problems down the right, but is lacking a final product.  
**43 Min'** Gabby gets free from Kelly, he looks to find Benteke with a cross but it's too high and is cleared.  
**44 Min'** Villa are slowing the game right down and keeping the ball without threatening.  
**45 Min'** Some nice passing play from Villa sees Hutton send a lofted cross into the box, but it fails to find a villa man.   
**45 Min'** [](#icon-timeclock) 2 Minutes of Added time  
**Half time: Crystal Palace 0 Aston Villa 1**  
**46 Min'** Palace have made a sub at half time [](#icon-subout-arrow) Gayle off for [](#icon-subin-arrow) Campbell  
**47 Min'** Bolasie puts an absolute cracker of a ball into the Six yard box, but no one is there to finish leaving Cissokho to clear.  
**49 Min'** Another ball in by Bolasie, Chamakh gets his head to it, but puts it wide.  
**50 Min'** Westwood puts a dangerous free kick into the box, Benteke is just short of making contact. The ball eventually ends up in the hands of Speroni.  
**54 Min'** It's all Palace, they are finding space down both wings and dragging Villa all over the place.  
**56 Min'** [](#icon-yellow-card) Campbell is through on goal, Guzan beats him to the ball and clears. Campbell gets a card for a late tackle on the keeper.   
**59 Min'** Palace want a penalty, Campbell goes down in the box off the ball, nothing is given.  
**60 Min'** [](#icon-offside) Zaha  
**66 Min'** From a Villa corner, Palace break 3 on 2, Zaha's miscontrol gives Hutton a chance to poke his foot in and clear.   
**67 Min'** It should be 2-0, a quick one-two on the edge of the box between Gabby &amp; Weimann, sees the Austrian in, his half volley is straight at the shins of Speroni &amp; Palace clear.  
**70 Min'** Guzan is caught for a second time, on this occasion it is McArthur after both players go up for a cross.  
**71 Min'** Okore is caught under the ball, allowing Campbell a run at goal. Clark comes across and puts just enough pressure on the forward, to force him into a miscue.  
**73 Min'** McArthur plays Bolasie in behind Hutton, he cuts onto his right foot to shoot but can't beat Okore.  
**77 Min'** It's all one way traffic, Palace just can't find the finishing touch needed.  
**80 Min'** [](#icon-yellow-card) Bolasie for a stamp on Hutton  
**81 Min'** [](#icon-yellow-card) Clark after a clash of heads with Campbell  
**83 Min'** Zaha with a low ball into the six yard box is gathered on the second attempt, after a spilling the original attempt.  
**84 Min'** The Palace crowd are getting very restless and are claiming for everything.   
**86 Min'** Villa free kick is cleared straight back out of the box.  
**88 Min'** [](#icon-subout-arrow) Kelly comes off for [](#icon-subin-arrow) Puncheon. Villa bring [](#icon-subout-arrow) Cleverley off for [](#icon-subin-arrow) Richardson.  
**90 Min'** [](#icon-timeclock) 4 Minutes of added time  
**90+1 Min'** [](#icon-yellow-card) Weimann for handball  
**90+3 Min'** [](#icon-offside) Agbonlahor  
**Full Time: Crystal Palace 0 Aston Villa 1**

The sloppy goal gifted by Scott Dann


Scott Dann's performance with England scouts watching


Zaha not going to do it today. Doesn't bring Puncheon on until 88mins. 


The lack of shots. 


The lack of quality for crosses, corners, free kicks and ""final ball.""


Campbell. 


'That' breakaway 3 on 2 and Campbell knocks it too far for their defender to clear. 


Bolasie never just cutting in and shooting. Always goes back and forth back and forth and then loses or gets a corner. 


Zaha's 1st half crosses.


Did I mention Campbell and the shit free kicks / corners?


The fact we are losing points to sides we need to beat to survive (Burnley, Newcastle, West Brom, Sunderland and now Villa.) These games will relegate us.

December 3rd, 2014

Kick Off: 19:45 (GMT), 2:45 PM (EST) 6:45 (AEDT)

Venue: [Stamford Bridge](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stamford_Bridge_(stadium)) London, England

TV: NBCSN (USA) 
----------------------------------------

-Spurs head to West London for a London derby with Chelsea. Chelsea currently sit on top of the Premier League, but they are coming off a less-than-stellar 0-0 draw with Sunderland. Chelsea have yet to lose this season.

-Last years matches against Chelsea were a mixed bag. We drew with them 1-1 at the Lane under AVB, and we lost 4-0 at the Bridge under Tim Sherwood. The away fixture was particularly controversial. We were in the match at halftime, with the score 0-0. Eto’o scored after a mistake from Vertonghen, then Eto’o took a shameful dive against Younes Kaboul in the box. The penalty was given, Kaboul was sent off, and we capitulated to lose 4-0.

-[Here's the match thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/coys/comments/1zwbh0/match_thread_chelsea_a/) from the last time we faced Chelsea. 

-Chelsea will be without Diego Costa as he is suspended on yellow cards. 

-Spurs will be without Emmanuel Adebayor, Etienne Capoue, and Danny Rose, but Kyle Naughton is back after his red card suspension.

-How do you expect us to lineup in this one?

-If we win this game we'll be on 23 points. We are currently only 2 points off of Man United in 4th, and we could possibly move ahead of them depending on their result with Stoke on Tuesday.

-It’s tough to find happy memories of games with Chelsea. Let’s go back to 2006 when Michael Dawson’s header equalized for us on our way to our first league win against Chelsea in a while. [Here is Dawson’s goal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEnrCV9WNis)

-After a slow start to the season, Spurs put out their best performance of the year on Sunday against Everton. We were all pleased to see Roberto Soldado finally get a goal in the Premier League after 9 months without one.  Christian Eriksen and Harry Kane also particularly impressed for Tottenham. Hopefully we can carry that form into this one.

-A win against Chelsea is probably too much to ask for, especially on the road. I don’t know about you guys, but I would be ecstatic with a point in this one. And I wouldn’t feel too badly about a hard-fought loss. Let’s just avoid some of the scorelines we’ve seen against Top 4 teams in the past couple years.

""We are unbeaten in four and have and won at a difficult place. Coming here was a massive result but I thought it was well deserved. 

I thought it was a big, big performance. I have played with some world class strikers and Christian Benteke, if he keeps progressing, could be one of the best. The performance was massive for us.

We are up to 12th, we have had a lot of players out, so the progress is there. I understand the disappointment because Aston Villa are a huge, huge football club

We were resolute. 

There were absolutely no problems with Roy Keane. He never had a break from Ireland and Aston Villa and I respect his decision to leave. There was no bust up or arguing. I thank him for his time at the club.""",false,avfc,t5_2s569,null,null,self,[Post Match] Crystal Palace 0 Aston Villa 1,9,http://www.reddit.com/r/avfc/comments/2o37sf/post_match_crystal_palace_0_aston_villa_1/

I have bought another motherboard from the same supplier and there is no issue present, thus proving the computer motherboard is at fault.

Very shortly, it seems like I might find myself having to choose between two job offers that I'm really excited about. It's really tough because when it comes to the jobs themselves both are very interesting, with their advantages and disadvantages.


Since I could probably be happy going either way, the biggest factor that I have to consider now is location. One job would be very close to Truro, Cornwall, while the other would be in King's Langley, to the north of London. Living in downtown London is completely outside my budget so I would be renting in King's Langley itself.

Being used to living in a big European city, at first I thought I would do better in King's Langley because I would be able to take the train down  to London easily, but I have been told trains from that area are pretty expensive, and I'm not even sure if I could get a monthly/yearly train pass (if you have information on this I'd really appreciate it).

Also, people seem to have very mixed opinions about how living in Truro (and Cornwall in general) is like. Some people really like the place and encourage me to work there, while others have told me it's a bit on the boring side outside holiday season. I've been google-mapping my way through the city and it seems reasonably big and with enough things to do, but I have no way to know.

So what would you do in my circumstance, all other factors being equal? Do you have any experience living or working at any of these two places? Anything you can tell me will go a long way, specially considering I have to make my decision soon :).

I've been applying for receptionist roles in London for the last few weeks. I spend a good few hours tailoring my cover letters and I've been told my CV is good, but I'm not hearing anything back whatsoever. I live in Leicester at the moment but make a point of saying that I'm relocating to London and am therefore looking for work in the area.

Could the fact that I don't live in London have something to do with it? 

As for my experience, I have almost two years worth of reception experience, plus additional admin experience from a previous job, but I've been told that unless I've worked for various companies as a receptionist rather than just one, I'm going to struggle. Is that true? As far as I was aware, I thought it would have been quality over quantity..?

Two decades ago I had the privilege of spending a year in London on business.  It was the 90s.  I had an expense account.  Thing were good.

I had a furnished flat, but I had to purchase my own bedding (paid for by my employer).  The flat was in W2, and so I went into the first home furnishing shop I could find and purchased the most expensive, beautiful, luxurious woolen blanket I have ever owned.

Two decades later I am a settled, dependable, middle-aged Yank with a wife I love very much.  She loves blankets.  She really does.  So this Christmas I would like to get her a duplicate of the amazing blanket I had back in London.

Only problem is I have no idea what it was and Google is not helping me get any closer.

What I do remember.  It felt like something you would find in a palace, and it came with a tag that sort of claimed the same.  The tag mentioned something to the effect of this blanket adorning the thrones of Kings since eighteen-blahdy-blah and being the official royal blankets.  That's pretty much all I have to go on.

Any ideas?

We are both in our early 30’s and have been dating for about 6 months. Due to some financial issues I have had to go for the inexpensive present of a Tardis hip flask. Originally she was not a Doctor Who fan but after getting her to watch the first couple of episodes she is now hooked and can’t stop watching it. The flask is on order from an [Etsy seller](https://www.etsy.com/au/listing/208613473/tardis-doctor-who-liquor-hip-flask?ref=shop_home_feat_3) and is the 8OZ model. I am hoping it will arrive in the next week as I have received shipping confirmation a week ago and think the bottom will be the best spot to get engraved. 



Why a hip flask? A couple of months ago she commented that she never owned a flask and borrowed mine so she could have a couple of vodkas at a function we attended that only served beer, wine and soft drinks. 



I did a quick google for Tardis sayings and came up with the following but none have inspired me yet. I would start with Dear “Name” and end with Love “Name”



“It's called the Tardis Flask. It can travel anywhere in time and space depending on how much you consume and it's yours!” (This is currently my front runner)



“All of time and space, everywhere and anywhere. Every star that ever was. Where do you want to start?”



“My angel has the phone box”



Any help with coming up with something would be appreciated. Cheers,

Some products that can be found on this website also don't seem to be sold outside of France, such as the 'Zeniac LP fort', an AHA and BHA cream that I've read incredible reviews on. Also, super cheap (around 5£).

I've used this site myself (shipping to France) and have had no issues, and only good things to say. Very good prices, very fast shipping.

I don't agree with that entirely, because I believe that elections are powerful and change the political make-up of the country. But I do believe that voting is a cathartic symbol that is like pissing into the wind. Millions of people will vote in a few months either against the tories or against labour. A tiny minority actually vote for anyone they believe in.

So I have an idea that will get democracy going again. An idea that has been entirely absent from UK politics for as long as I know. 

Don't just vote Labour, vote for them and protest them. Don't just vote for the Greens, vote for them and then go out on the streets and demand they do what they said they would. 

People vote as if making a cross on a piece of paper once every 5 years is sufficient. It's not. You cannot expect politicians to do what they said they would do when they get into power. 

Vote for them, and then protest their inaction on the first day. Look how many people were conned into voting for the Lib Dems. They did nothing but cave to the tories. Now imagine if 10% of the people that voted for them took to the streets and demanded that the Lib Dems did what they said they would do. They would have to do something.

Vote AND protest. That's the solution. Protest your own candidate from the beginning. Force them to do their job. Let them know that you voted for them for a reason, and demand they fulfil their promises.

When you think about how many people voted Lib Dem in the last election, and how many will vote for them in the next, you know that they pissed off millions of people. But all of those voters remained passive for the last four and a half years. with a vague hope that they might do something worthwhile. It never happened.

They should have been protesting against Clegg 3 years ago. He took their votes and threw them in the bin. He didn't give a fuck what the people who voted for him wanted. 

Vote, elect, protest. Don't give them a chance to reconsider all the points on their manifesto. Make them stick to it. This country is entirely too permissive of manifesto lies. It's not enough to just vote. You have to demand what you voted for, from day one.

I am making the very exciting move to Brighton from NZ in February. I am a 23 year old female, originally from England (Leeds) but have lived in NZ most of my life. I'm moving back to do my Masters, which starts in September, but want to settle in Brighton from Feb till September and get a job and have some fun!


I have experience in retail, childcare, and admin (I've been an Executive Assistant for the past 2 years), and have an Honours degree in Psychology. I would ideally want an office type role, but will happily do retail or bar work too!


I have family in Brighton, who I can stay with, but I want to find a place of my own. So I'll be looking to join an established flat where I can take a room. 


So, basically, I am after advice/suggestions on places to look for work (temp agencies?), how to go about finding a flat, where nice places are to live, which places to avoid... anything you can tell me!

Firstly, among the impatient and, perhaps, slightly ignorant fans, the match confirmed that Leicester's situation is officially a full-blown crisis and - Oh my God! - Just look at the table, we're bottom! Something has to change, it must be Nigel Pearson, he must be sacked. Yes, forget the fact he saved this club from its darkest days in League 1 and secured Leicester's highest ever points total last season. He's not even reached the half way point of this premier league campaign so do the man, and the club, a favour and stop creating a negative atmosphere by speculating about his job.

Obviously, there are areas where change is needed. The lack of an attack-minded midfielder to run at defences and create chances is evident, something that Pearson is likely to address, along with the lack of quality in the left back position, in January (If people stop foreshadowing his departure by somehow thinking Tony Pulis would be able to do better with Nigel Pearson's carefully-constructed side than Nigel Pearson).

However, if you look beneath the result you will see that last night we created more chances and had more shots than last year's premier league runners up. This could be revolutionary to our season after a frustrating attacking drought that saw us not score in five games - we have just scored three goals in two games.

Maybe this season's flying-start raised the expectations of the Leicester supporters, but we are a newly-promoted side and we do have the least combined Premier League appearances in the division.

I started gambling a few months ago just on football and some of the business practices I've come across are totally scummy.  They seem to just be able to do what ever they want.

**Are you a winner?** = banned or limited to betting £2 -£5 a time    

**Make a single bet they don't like?** = bet voided if it wins, bet stands if it loses and your account is probably closed    

**Are you someone who they think you will lose in the long run?** = They will allow you to bet more than normal which I personally think is a disgrace, especially when they are constantly talking about ""responsible gambling"".  For example I know William Hill will do this, and will increase an account's stake factor to 200% or more.

These aren't small unknown bookmakers either, Coral, bet365, Paddy Power, bet victor etc all do this.  So basically if I want to carry on betting with these companies I have to open accounts in other people's names.

Then you have the FOBTs which allow you to turn over massive amounts of money very quickly.  I don't understand why anyone would use these other than because they are addicted.

______________________________________
Food for thought...

All 11 points have so far come from home games. That's a rate of 1.6 points per home game. We have 12 home games remaining. So we may expect to get (1.6 x 12 =)  19 points from the remaining home games, giving us (19 +11 =) 30 points. Meaning **we need to get a further 5 points from away games**. Where will those 5 away points come from?

Alternatively..

The more astute among you may already have noticed our home form has improved in recent weeks. In fact the past 4 home games (since our post-West Ham awakening) have earned us 7 points = 1.8 points per game. If we continue that home form, our remaining home games would earn us (12 x 1.8 =) 22 points. Leaving **just 2 away points needed for PL survival**.

______________________________________

**In conclusion**

To stay in the Premier league, we need to:

* Maintain our home form

* Win 2 away games

The possible house I could afford is slowly downgrading to the point where I'd rather rent than own.

I currently have £54k in various savings (ISA, Premium Bonds, savings accounts) and was hoping to use some (not all) as a deposit.

As I've only worked two years and my fiancée is currently unemployed (studies) I have a feeling a mortgate wouldn't be the easiest thing to come by as is...

By the time I am ready to buy, the savings will probably have dipped at least £4,000 (I recently passed my driving test, need to get a car, tax, insurance plus other expenses) and I wouldn't want to use all the money on a deposit as that is literally all my savings.

We are fairly close to London (my kind of work is heavily situated here or Brighton, both expensive to live near) so prices were already fairly steep (but no way near as bad as London itself). But in the last few, even months, we have watched properties that were worth about 130k, climb to 150 and upwards. Houses we once thought, ""that looks great"" are now 200k, which I don't think is realistic for us to get a mortgage on.

So what is going on? Should someone buy in such an environment? Would waiting bring it down (people murmur about a crash but I don't know if there's any evidence of that happening)? What kind of property would even be realistic to buy? We're mid 20s, my salary is 28,000 a year, hers is 0 at the moment.

So, I thought I'd create this thread where we could discuss the Wednesday matches in general and how they affect our position in the table. Feel free to speculate on any of Today's games here.

Game 1: Everton (11th / 17 points) vs Hull (18th / 11 points)

It would be huge if Hull could pull off a win or draw against Everton to keep both teams below us in the table. I don't have much more knowledge about this match up, but I feel like it could be a close match.

Game 2: Sunderland (14th / 14 points) vs Man City (2nd / 27 points)

This is a match that really interest me and could have some direct impact on Liverpool. Obviously Sunderland would love to come out of this game, especially with it being a home match. I could really see them pushing all they have at Man City to try and at least steal a point. However, Sunderland has to turn around and face Liverpool on Saturday. How do you think this will affect their game plan? Do you think a large defeat or draw would be better for Liverpool facing a tired Sunderland side.

Game 3: Chelsea (1st / 33 points) vs Tottenham (9th / 20 points)

I can't say that I'd like to see Chelsea continue their undefeated streak, but a Chelsea win here would keep Tottenham below us in the table. 

Game 4: Arsenal (7th / 20 points) vs Southampton (3rd / 26 points)

A game that could be very close, especially with it being played at the Emirates Stadium. A win by Arsenal would put them ahead of us by 3 points, but would also keep Southampton within 6 points. What do you think is the best outcome for Liverpool?

just want to branch this subreddit out and get some debate and information as well as just articles about the green party, so i was wondering about new members experiences, both how you came to join the party and how you are experiencing it after joining.

so was there a specific reason that caused you to join the party, or was there a broad collection of reasons to support the green party but a tipping point that caused you to join the party when you did.


If you've joined recently, have you gone to any local party or regional party meetings, or any demonstrations or leafleting? if you have, where did you get the info, if you haven't have you been aware of event or not? and what do you think the best way is for the party to contact you about volunteering for events? 

Also have you voted before and if so which party did you vote for, were you a member of any other political parties?

that seems like a lot of questions now I've typed them out, I'm just interested to learn what peoples expectations were joining the party and what their experiences have been once they have joined.",false,UKGreens,t5_34166,null,null,self,Are you a new member?,5,http://www.reddit.com/r/UKGreens/comments/2o5h9o/are_you_a_new_member/

I would like to start off by saying I for one have never been Nigel Pearsons biggest fan however he got us promoted back to the Premier League, so I have to give him an awful lot of credit as it was a dream come true. I do think he needs time but 1 point in 8 games I am afraid is not good enough managers have lost jobs by doing a lot better then that. Now we might sack him and bring Tony Pulis in but that doesn't mean we automatically survive. I do think their has to be change in either management or if Pearson is to stay he needs to give players like Simpson, Knockeart, Powell &amp; Albrighton a chance from the start of the game, if not I would imagine some will want away in January. 
Management change I would not mind Tony Pulis he does know the premier league. 

On a separate note the spat last night I think Pearson should not have said anything, lots of managers (Pardew, Rogers) have had abuse thrown at them from their own fans but have been the better person and not said anything which is what Pearson should have done. 

But of course everybody can pretend to be a football manager and like me say this that &amp; the other but I don't like the fans who just say ""F*** off"" &amp; ""your a knobhead"" as there only response when somebody disagrees with them about Pearson/Players as there the ones who are the knobheads and can't provide anything valid to the argument. 
Hopefully I don't get that response in this text! I would just like to see people's opinions on this topic on this website as people on Facebook are talking a load of baloney.

I apologies if this is the wrong subreddit for this question... I welcome suggestions for the correct one if it is!!

I have 10 years worth of box files of admin accounts, including bank statements, payslips and tax records. Obviously this takes up a lot of room, I'm unsure when I need to 'throw these out' (i.e. shred them to high heaven). I feel a good middle ground is to digitise everything, including this years and then shred the lot. Keeps everything organised, easily accessible and saves space.

My questions are:

* is there anything I need to have as a hard copy? Payslips for example.
* is there anything I need to have as hard copy for a limited amount of time e.g. payslips for this year, then they can be digitised
* anybody have any advice on doing this?

Many thanks!!

You can read them [here](http://www.bbfc.co.uk/sites/default/files/attachments/BBFC%20Classification%20Guidelines%202014_5.pdf) (page 24)

&gt;The following content is not acceptable:


&gt;• material which is in breach of the criminal law, including material judged to be obscene under the current interpretation of the *Obscene Publications Act 1959 (see Annexe)*


&gt;• material (including dialogue) likely to encourage an interest in sexually abusive activity which may include adults role-playing as non-adults


&gt;• the portrayal of sexual activity which involves real or apparent lack of consent. Any form of physical restraint which *prevents participants from indicating a withdrawal of consent*


&gt;• the infliction of pain or acts which may cause *lasting physical harm*, whether real or (in a sexual context) simulated. Some allowance may be made for moderate, non-abusive, consensual activity


&gt;• penetration by any object associated with violence or likely to cause physical harm


&gt;• sexual threats, humiliation or abuse which *do not form part of a clearly consenting role-playing game*. Strong physical or verbal abuse, even if consensual, is unlikely to be acceptable


&gt;These Guidelines will be applied to the same standard regardless of sexual orientation of the activity portrayed.

Italics are my emphasis. Meanwhile the Independent claims the following are now banned:

&gt;Spanking

&gt;Caning

&gt;Aggressive whipping

&gt;**Penetration by any object ""associated with violence""**

&gt;Physical or verbal abuse (regardless of  if consensual)

&gt;Urolagnia (known as ""water sports"")

&gt;**Role-playing as non-adults**

&gt;Physical restraint

&gt;Humiliation

&gt;Female ejaculation

&gt;Strangulation

&gt;Facesitting

&gt;Fisting

The ones in bold are the ones that are on the actual list. Anyone know where the hell they got the rest from? [The Obscene Publications Act 1959](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Eliz2/7-8/66/contents) is pretty vague and doesn't mention any acts in particular beyond:

&gt;'an article shall be deemed to be obscene if its effect or (where the article comprises two or more distinct items) the effect of any one of its items is, if taken as a whole, such as to tend to deprave and corrupt persons who are likely, having regard to all relevant circumstances, to read, see or hear the matter contained or embodied in it.'

And the [Criminal Justice and Immigration Act 2008](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2008/4/part/5/crossheading/pornography-etc) says:

&gt;(a)an act which threatens a person's life,

&gt;(b)an act which results, or is likely to result, in serious injury to a person's anus, breasts or genitals,

&gt;(c)an act which involves sexual interference with a human corpse, or

&gt;(d)a person performing an act of intercourse or oral sex with an animal (whether dead or alive),

&gt;and a reasonable person looking at the image would think that any such person or animal was real.

Is this seriously just clickbait?

That 3-5-2 formation in other situations though, especially against our peers at the top of the table, could be really enticing going forward. I was gutted to see Collins dropped from the 11, he's played his heart out the past few games. This potential lineup, with cresswell and jenkinson bombing up on counters, would be delightful.

* Tomkins - Reid - Collins
* Jenkinson -Song - Noble - Downing - Cresswell

I'm fairly new to this sub, but wanted to share a spreadsheet I made which you may find useful. I've recently taken on a mortgage and wanted to find a way to see what my future monthly repayments would be (broken up into Principal and Interest) if my interest rate changed or I overpaid one month. 

In the spreadsheet, enter you amount borrowed into cell J5, the term (in years) into cell J4 and the interest rate into cell J3. Ta Da. You can now see your future payments over time.

You can update the interest rate if it changes over the period using column B. If you make an overpayment one month, enter it into column I and you will see the payments for your following months update.

Any questions, ideas, tips, updates you would like to see? Let me know your thoughts.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

-Come on you Spurs!!

-Really nervous but excited for this one. I'd be very happy with a draw here. We'll certainly have to defend well, and this will probably be a very stressful game to watch. 

-Chelsea start Didier Drogba up top instead of Loic Remy, Costa is out suspended on yellows.

-[Watch this video if you feel like having a pre-game cry. Warning: contains Bale and Dawson](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qiors4McDl0)

--Delighted to be bringing this one to you. I'm drinking a beer and eating Teriyaki Chicken Tempura. I can promise that even if things don't go our way today, I will stay positive...as should you! Chelsea are the best team in England and we just had a really encouraging performance against Everton.

-----------------------------------------------------------------

**First Half:**

-It appears that the lights are off at Stamford Bridge. All that dirty Russian money and they can't even pay the electric bill???

Kickoff

1' Early on Chelsea seem to be going right at Chiriches, playing through Hazard on that side.

3' Lennon earns a corner with nice work on the right. Lamela takes the corner short but it is knocked out for another corner. That corner is sent in and cleared out towards Kane. Kane runs right at Ivanovic and earns a free kick in a really dangerous position right outside the box in the corner.

4' Chiriches sends a ball into the box that sees Vertonghen and Cahill clash heads. Cahill looks like he got it worse than Jan.

8' Mason finds Lennon down the right who sends in a really dangerous ball for Kane, but Harry hits the crossbar! What a header from Harry so close!!!

9' Wow I can't even keep up with our nice play right now! Great move through the middle with Lamela, Mason and Eriksen. The way Lamela picked it off Hazard to get started was particularly impressive.

12' Gary Cahill gets caught out with it by Harry Kane. Kane drives towards goal and puts an effort across and past the far post from a really tough angle. ""Harry Kane he's one of our own"" ringing around Stamford Bridge.

16' Game has slowed down a bit. We're showing good composure in the midfield with Mason and Bentaleb.

19' **Chelsea Goal** Well that was nice while it lasted. Hazard is the scorer after a really nice give and go with Drogba. But Lloris knew that he should have done better on that one, his reaction said it all.

22' **Chelsea Goal 2-0** Bad distribution from Lloris finds Hazard, who finds Drogba. Didier turns and easily fires past Lloris. 

26' Well we haven't completely given up. What a sucker punch that is, we were so good for the first 15 minutes. Could've been 2-0 up but now we're 2-0 down. Come on Lads chin up keep going!

28' Nice combination between Eriksen and Lennon almost produces something in the box. 

30' Hugo really needs to work on his kicking. He's had really bad distribution tonight and is consistently kicking it out of play.

36' Drogba blasts a free kick into Row Z.

40' Lamela plays Kane through with a nice ball but Kane is offside. Courtois saved anyway.

43' Cesc free kick comes to nothing, and then Kane stops another promising Chelsea attack with a smart foul by Kane. All started with a bad giveaway from Ryan Mason. 

45' Not sure what Chiriches is doing...He just lays the ball to Oscar from in the corner. Oscar crosses for Willian who's low shot is saved by Lloris.

**Halftime Chelsea 2-0 Spurs**

-We started so well, then played like absolute shit for 15 minutes, then we finished decently. We're not out of this game, but we need to regroup at halftime. Naughton needs to come in for Chiriches, who is having a bit of a shocker at RB.

**2nd Half**

**Chelsea Sub** 

Kurt Zouma comes on for Gary Cahill. No subs for Tottenham.

49' Slow start to the 2nd half. A Chelsea cross was cleared by Vertonghen. Chiriches has just picked up a yellow card for tugging Hazard's shirt to stop a break.

50' Kane drives at the Chelsea defense on the counter. Matic knocks him over and is given a yellow card. 

51' Eriksen picks up the ball after nice link-up play from Kane. Christian has a go from 30 yards out and puts it over. I like that aggressiveness from Christina. Harry Kane then makes another nice back tackle and sets Lennon in but he loses out. That could've been a big chance.

54' We earn a corner off a weird deflection, but the corner doesn't clear the first man..........so frustrating.

56' All I can hear is our away fans. It's a beautiful sound and a great show of support.

""OH WHEN THE SPURS GO MARCHING IN""

**Tottenham Subs**

Paulinho replaces Ryan Mason

Nacer Chadli replaces Aaron Lennon

60' Drogba mis-hits a shot in the box but earns a corner. Fabregoon takes it but it's headed clear.

62' Kane earns a corner with a nice run. Eriksen takes this one and it's headed on by Vertonghen at the near post but well over the top. 

64' Drogba boxes out Fazio and turns to shoot on Lloris who easily saves at his near post.

67' A lot of possession for Spurs at the edge of the box, but none of it is really that meaningful. 

**Chelsea Sub** 

Loic Remy replaces Didier Drogba.

70' Chelsea seem happy to sit back and let us have it right now. Kane tries to play Eriksen in but Courtois comes out to claim.

73' **Chelsea Goal 3-0** Loic Remy outmuscles Jan Vertonghen and scores.

74' **Tottenham Sub**

Erik Lamela is replaced by Roberto Soldado

76' **Chelsea Sub**

Cesc Fabregas comes off for John Obi Mikel.

79' Chelsea just seeing this game out now.

84' Chiriches ball is turned out for a corner by Ivanovic. Corner is taken short and cleared out for a throw in.

86' Chadli runs well at the Chelsea defense and picks out Eriksen, but his cross is too close to Courtois.

89' Willian takes a shot to the head. A minute later he's running and shooting, his effort is saved by Lloris.

3 minutes of stoppage time

91' Kane is limping a little bit out there, I think I saw him holding his back at one point. Hopefully he's okay.

92' Willian free kick headed away by Fazio.

93' I can still hear our fans chanting YID ARMY as we line up a free kick. The kick is knocked over to Chadli who strikes it and forces a strong save out of Courtois. But then, the full time whistle.
