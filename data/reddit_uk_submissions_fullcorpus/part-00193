The other day School Reunion came to my mind, I immediately did a little research: William Russell, the actor who played Ian, one of the first companions, is still alive. He even did an interview for the 50th and starred in An Adventure in Space and Time.

For a long time now I was thinking that Moffat must have thought of bringing back Ian, now more than ever, since we see more and more of Coal Hill. I was curious if he could show up in The Caretaker, but that wasn't very likely since we know that he became the Chairman of the Governors for the school and is a professor at Cambridge.

I think it would be wonderful to have him back on our screens, especially since William is almost 90, and we may not have another opportunity in the future.",false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,null,null,self,Bringing back Ian Chesterton,30,http://www.reddit.com/r/doctorwho/comments/2i16gs/bringing_back_ian_chesterton/

 You might of seen our youtube channel but we believe we may be one of the only wannabee disc dog teams in the UK. Unfortunately in the UK we have various dog sports, obedience, agility, rally, freestyle etc, but disc is not recognised as one. So we are somewhat unique.

A couple of weeks ago we were won second at a competition at NEC in Birmingham and were approached by a BGT researcher over twitter. I have bombarded them with questions as still on the fence as I haven't made my mind up and wondered if redditors could help us (you don't know us, so relatively independent!).

Pros: If when I submit another video the producers like us, we go straight through to the live shows. We would get to perform the act outside in a large area, so not limited by the stage size. Would be an experience and sure my pup would lap it up if it went well, all good fun.

Cons: Our choreography is crap but they have promised to help sort this. I'm worried we will look like deluded crazies!

Has anyone got any experience of this?

Liverpool need to hire a better defensive coach or something because this is getting out of hand. Now Balotelli, I don't understand why everyone is expecting so much, maybe because ""he's the guy that's suppose to replace Suarez"" but what people don't realize he's never scored more than 15 goals a season and personally I think thats a pretty track record. I'll give him the benefit of the doubt in the fact that his work rates are good it might be just because it's a season and usually he does start off pretty strong but it's not acceptable. He needs to bang goals against these types of teams. I honestly think once Daniel Sturridge comes back and Liverpool go back to diamond mid field, everything will go back the way the were last year.

I just watched ""Daleks in Manhatten"" and ""Evolution of the Daleks"", and my god are those the most poorly-designed, plothole-ridden episodes of any tv show I've ever seen. Obviously they're old, so this post is in no way topical, but seriously, holy crap these episodes are bad.

I should point out that up until this point I actually liked what I'd seen of doctor who. It seemed like a fun, somewhat silly, british sci-fi show, and it was something I could get into. And then this happened.

So first-off, whoever was doing the dialogue should have been fired the moment they gave Tallulah (or however the heck you spell that) the line ""It's as if he doesn't want me to see him"" (probably not verbatim) while talking about whoever keeps leaving roses on her dresser after Laszlo disappeared. In that instant, every shred of doubt that may have remained concerning both the origins of the pig-men and Laszlo's fate was clumsily revealed, and all mystery was lost, making the *actual* explanation about the pig men, as well as the absurdly drawn-out reveal of Laszlo as a pig, completely redundant.

Now, let's talk about the Cult of Skarro's plan. They did an ""emergency temporal shift"" that landed them in 1930s New York, and since an emergency temporal shift, in the Doctor's words, ""must have burned out your power cells"", they could not leave. Let's leave that temporal shift alone for now; I'll be coming back to it later.

So, having no resources beyond what is available to them on planet earth, the Daleks, being the Cult of Skarro and therefore designed for such things, try to imagine a new way to achieve Dalek supremacy in their current predicament. The idea they come up with, or at least Dalek Sek comes up with, is that Daleks must evolve to survive, which is completely against the whole point of being a Dalek. I actually like this part. I think it's a really interesting idea that a Dalek would become aware of the inherent futility of their primary goal. However, the only reason it makes sense is because the Daleks are in a situation where they have *no* *other* *alternative*. Nothing else could make a Dalek even consider such a thing.

And that's a real shame because the episode later reveals that as a matter of fact that not only is there a significantly more viable alternative, but the Daleks actually carry it out! The entire existential thing was completely meaningless, and should never have happened! The alternative is, as Sek and the Doctor are preparing to fuse Dalek and human DNA, the remaining three ""pure"" Daleks alter the process so that the human bodies will now become ""100 percent Dalek"".

So... what? WHY would the Daleks ever have even considered merging humans with Daleks *partway* if the option to completely overwrite blank human bodies existed? This makes Dalek Sek's willingness to contaminate himself with humanity *completely* *absurd*! There is *no* *way* that the Daleks would get as far as the idea to *partially* fuse human bodies with Dalek DNA without coming up with the idea to completely overwrite the humans *first*! Even if one of the Daleks did somehow come up with the fusion idea, the conversation would have looked like this:

Dalek 1: ""We may be able to fuse Dalek and human DNA""

Dalek 2: ""Unnecessary. We already possess the technology to completely eradicate the human parts of their brains. There is no reason to do so only halfway.""

And that would have been the end of it! The idea that evolution is the only option would never even have come up, because at no point was it ever the only option!

So, the episode has just rendered its own plot redundant, and how does it end? The doctor goes up to Dalek Khan, the last remaining Dalek in the entire universe, and it does something that is both completely in character for a Dalek, and utterly ridiculous and nonsensical in terms of the situation.

It does the emergency temporal shift that the Daleks were UNABLE TO DO, WHICH WAS THE JUSTIFICATION FOR THE ENTIRE EPISODE. THEIR POWER CELLS WERE ""BURNED OUT"". Obviously, the rebuttal here is that the doctor only said they were burned out, and they might not have been and he just didn't know. Except that, if the Daleks were capable of doing another temporal shift, they would have *done* *so* instantly! The whole reasons they come up with the plan that is the driving plot of the entire episode is because they are *stranded*! If, as it turns out, they weren't stranded, they would have fucking left! At this point, the redundancies I previously outlined concerning the Daleks' actual plan were themselves rendered moot by the fact that the entire sequence of events should *never* *have* *happened*!

**At this point I feel like I should point out that I am not insulting Doctor Who as a whole, nor do I have a problem with anyone who is a Whovian. Like I said earlier, I was actually enjoying the show up until this point. I'm not trying to rabblerouse; the purpose of this post is to rant about and explain the problems I have with a specific episode. Please keep that in mind when responding. Everyone is entitled to an opinion and I respect those that differ from mine. If you liked Evolution of the Daleks, tell me why and I will completely accept your point of view and right to disagree.**

On Sunday, he was paired up with Capoue in the midfield where our beloved Frenchman had the job of constantly recycling possession and breaking up Arsenal's flow of play, a job he undoubtedly did very well, especially against the likes of Ozil and Wilshere.

So where does out beloved Mason stand in the grand scheme of ""Pochettino's System"", a term that is languidly thrown about. In my humble opinion, Mason is used as a kind of advanced midfielder, who constantly makes runs and tries to win the ball higher up the pitch. This is contrasted by Caopue who is left to intercept and cover defenders. Due to how high Mason has to be sometimes, the likes of Lamela and Eriksen have to sometimes track back and put in more effort in their defending. This is further seen when Poch substituted Chadli for Bentaleb, to beef up the midfield and hold off the fort.

I hope he'll start again against Bestikas in a more attacking position, such as the one he played against Nottingham Forrest. While he was okay defensively in the last game he started in, albeit very good for a Premier League debut, I get the sense that he can fulfill Paulinho's role, in a sense that he operates both defensively when required but makes smart runs and passes in the opposition's half to set up goal-scoring opportunities.

[You can download a PDF copy here.] (https://www.dropbox.com/s/z1byrpf5vidyotj/Cigar%20Tasting%20Notes.pdf?dl=0)

The template is in A5 format, and I've bought an A5 ring binder with some dividers so that I can index all the notes by brand so that if I ever need to refer to them they're easy to navigate. It'll be easy enough to print them onto hole-punched plain A5 sheets.

I was approved for a 150k mortgage and it took me a while to find a house so the credit checks had expired, within that time I had a 20% (300 per month) payrise so I decided to spend £100 a month of that on a new laptop on credit so I would have more disposable income to put towards the house savings which I felt was a responsible use of the credit.

Doing so has destroyed my credit score to the point where I now don't qualify for the 5% deposit mortgage I was going to get and no other lenders seem to lend as much as I need.

I have a couple of credit cards but only use one of them and overdraft facilities on two current accounts, only one account ever uses the overdraft and a little over £10k in savings to cover the 5% house deposit and all associated fees with buying the house.

I've got continuous employment history for 5 years and my salary has continuously increased in that time up 50% from 5 years ago, and can prove my ability to pay the mortgage, infact I could if needed pay upto double the minimum each month.

It was shortly after I fucked up my face tripping over my own shoelace (fuck off don't start) and in all honesty, I appreciated that more than anything else all year.  
  
  He's absolutely mad about holidays. Loves them. He goes several times a year to different places, talks about hotels, food, flights, likes to give suggestions and whatnot.  
  
  Now, recently my missus and I decided that over our anniversary (5!) we would take some time off and fuck off to Prague for a couple of days, see some sights and drink some beer. Having decided it was time to book it, the other day we had a look at prices and were dismayed at how expensive Prague had become. Seriously, for a couple of days you're looking at a minimum of 250 quid each without food, drink, travel or anything. For that, we can book a 4 star package in North Africa (Morocco, Tunisia) with everything thrown in for a whole week and actually get some sun. So, I came in the next day, and asked him for some suggestions.   
  
  Being a holiday king, he went google mad, found us loads of different options all the way down to car parking at Gatwick, which all in all is super useful, and was fun for him. He arrived in Tunisia at some point late last night, and phoned into the office this morning. I thought it would be the usual 'Alright Samson, anything going on?' phonecall, but no. Turns out, the hotel he had his eyes on for us, is directly opposite the one he's staying in.  
 
  So, being a very peculiar man, he woke up this morning, had breakfast, waved his missus goodbye and walked across the road to demand a viewing of different rooms, suites, the bar and restaurant areas and then proceeded to phone into the office from his mobile to talk me through the tour he's just had, and then *read the brochure* out to me over the phone.  
  
  I know that's really sweet, but it's quite mad, no?

My name is Joel and I am from Sweden. Me and my two fellow students Mattias och Jesper are going to watch the match between QPR and Aston Villa this month as a part of a project. The purpose of our project is to investigate safety and english football and how the police /security guards work to create a safe environment. We are going to try to contact someone in the police corps to find out about this, but we aslo need to hear the opinions of the supporters. Therefore I am asking for some advice from the supporters who are using this forum. Does somebody here know anyone who can help us and be our contact person? We actually need to meet this person on the matchday and ask him/her some questions.

You might of seen our youtube channel but we believe we may be one of the only wannabee disc dog teams in the UK. Unfortunately in the UK we have various dog sports, obedience, agility, rally, freestyle etc, but disc is not recognised as one. So we are somewhat unique.
A couple of weeks ago we were won second at a competition at NEC in Birmingham and were approached by a BGT researcher over twitter. I have bombarded them with questions as still on the fence as I haven't made my mind up and wondered if redditors could help us (you don't know us, so relatively independent!).
Pros: If when I submit another video the producers like us, we go straight through to the live shows. We would get to perform the act outside in a large area, so not limited by the stage size. Would be an experience and sure my pup would lap it up if it went well, all good fun.
Cons: Our choreography is crap but they have promised to help sort this. I'm worried we will look like deluded crazies!
Has anyone got any experience of this?

By Michael Pooler in London

Seven years ago, a report commissioned by Michael Bloomberg, New York’s then mayor, warned the city was in danger of being dethroned as the world’s financial capital by London.
New York was becoming less attractive as a place to do financial services business because of a mixture of excessive litigation, stifling regulation and restrictive immigration rules, according to about 50 chief executives interviewed by McKinsey for the study. London, by contrast, was exerting a pull on banks and investment houses as British politicians trumpeted the capital’s “light touch” regulation.


Six years on from the collapse of Lehman Brothers, both financial centres are transformed. Banks on both sides of the Atlantic were floored by the crisis, but, having taken risk off their balance sheets, are now bouncing back.
Regulators, meanwhile, have toughened their safety and soundness requirements and, particularly in the US, are on a mission to extract maximum penalties for past misdeeds.


Where does that leave the head-to-head battle between New York and London? Which financial centre is in the ascendancy? And will Asia’s hubs in Hong Kong, Singapore and Shanghai steal the global crown?


For now, the largest New York-listed banks by market capitalisation dwarf their London-listed rivals and the city remains the undisputed global king of equities.
Its two stock exchanges – NYSE, which this month hosted the Alibaba initial public offering, and Nasdaq – have held IPOs that raised a combined $77bn so far this year, or 41 per cent of the $186bn raised globally, according to Dealogic. London raised just over $25bn, for a share of 14 per cent. New York is also home to four out of every 10 hedge funds.


Christian Meissner, global head of corporate and investment banking at Bank of America Merrill Lynch, says the world’s deepest capital markets are in New York.
“As much as London might think it’s the financial centre, I think New York is still ultimately the centre of the financial system.”

“It’s the dollar, it’s the Fed – it’s because US capital markets and the US economy are the deepest, it has the largest number of big companies.”
Mr Meissner says London is a close second.


“If you’re doing business in Asia and the emerging markets, London is much more convenient. It has the timezone and is the most global.”


Xavier Rolet, chief executive of the London Stock Exchange Group, insists that overall the City of London is clearly the world’s leading international financial centre. And the recent spurt in the UK’s economic fortunes have given it another boost.
Chief Executive of the London Stock Exchange Group, Xavier Rolet, addresses the delegates at the annual Confederation of British Industry (CBI) conference in central London on November 4, 2013. British Prime Minister David Cameron on Monday welcomed a call from the nation's business leaders for Britain to remain in the European Union, ahead of a referendum in 2017.


“In the last two years, the regulatory and fiscal measures introduced by the UK government to recalibrate [small business] funding around risk and equity capital have nurtured a tech revolution which has helped fuel an impressive economic and jobs recovery,” says Mr Rolet, pictured. “Ensuring that these minnows succeed on the path from ‘start-up to stardom’ is one of LSE’s priorities.”


The UK dominates in currency trading and over-the-counter interest rate derivatives, accounting for 41 and 49 per cent of turnover in each market, respectively, according to the Bank of International Settlements. By contrast, the US has a 19 per cent share of currency trading and 23 per cent of OTC interest rate derivatives.


London recently became home to the first clearing bank outside Asia for the renminbi, boosting its attempt to be the leading offshore trading centre in the Chinese currency.
“London has a huge timezone advantage,” says Kevin Burrowes of consultants PwC. “It remains the biggest foreign exchange market because of the ability to trade with east and west in the course of a normal business day”.

So far, at least, new European restrictions on bonuses have not undermined London dramatically, with no wholesale shift of financial services jobs away from the UK, either to New York, or Asia.


After dipping during the crisis, the total number of banking jobs in London broke through pre-crisis levels last year, hitting 147,100, according to a survey by industry group TheCityUK. That took total financial services jobs in the city, including finance and fund management, to a record 367,300.


Though like-for-like figures are difficult to come by, estimates from the New York State Department of Labor suggest the city has 502,400 finance and insurance jobs – 8 per cent lower than the sector’s employment peak in 2007.


Even so, the bonus pool for employees at New York securities firms last year was at its largest since 2008 – at $26.7bn, up 15 per cent on 2012, against the £14bn ($22.9bn) paid out across the UK’s insurance and finance sectors as a whole.

There are anecdotal suggestions that the impact of new bonus rules and other regulatory pressures has yet to feed through fully: 90 per cent of senior City staff now say they are willing to move abroad, up from 77 per cent last year, according to a survey by recruitment company Astbury Marsden.
New York wins the super-rich contest – it has 98 dollar billionaires to London’s 55, according to estimates by WealthInsight.


WPP Chief Executive Martin Sorrell talks during a session at the World Economic Forum in Davos on January 22, 2014. Some 40 world leaders gather in the Swiss ski resort Davos to discuss and debate a wide range of issues including the causes of conflicts plaguing the Middle East, and how to reinvigorate the global economy.


A recent survey conducted by Wealth-X, a research company, and UBS, the Swiss bank, also found that New York was the home of the biggest number of billionaires – 103 – followed by Moscow (85), Hong Kong (82), and London (72).


There is a soft appeal to both London and New York, says Sir Martin Sorrell, the British chief executive of advertising group WPP, who spends about 100 days a year working in each city. He says the longer commutes and earlier workday start times in New York can be frustrating, but that both cities have “superb” cultural offerings and are making strong pushes to grow their technology sector.
London, he says, is challenged by its poor airport infrastructure and uncertainty over the future of the UK’s status within the EU.


“From my point of view, both cities work extremely well,” says Mr Sorrell, pictured. “I probably deep down prefer London, but I’m increasingly ambivalent and agnostic.”

While regulators in both cities have taken off the gloves in response to a series of market manipulation scandals, New York’s enforcers are seen by many as acting tougher. Even before French bank BNP Paribas was hit with a record $8.9bn penalty for evading sanctions, Wall Street banks and their foreign rivals had paid out $100bn in US settlements since the financial crisis.


But by imposing a large chunk of recent penalties on banks outside home territory, New York authorities risk a backlash against their domestic operators by foreign regulators, says Mark Yeandle, author of the most recent Global Financial Centres Index, a twice-yearly ranking which assesses a range of competitiveness measures.
London’s future is tied to whether Britain stays in the EU and the prospect of it leaving has unnerved investors. Wall Street banks have been considering plans to move some London-based activities to Ireland – partly because the eurozone’s impending banking union threatens to isolate Britain, but also in the case of a UK exit from the EU.


As former mayor Bloomberg’s McKinsey study suggested back in 2007, business can shift to jurisdictions where the legal and regulatory environment is more attractive. And in today’s world, New York and London have reason to be wary of their Asian rivals.

Out of all those games we only lost 2. We somehow managed to lose to Stoke. But got a big draw with Chelsea.

There was only really 1 game where we looked like the inferior team and that was against Bayern. Every other game we were the aggressor. Some of those games didn't work out like Chelsea and Arsenal.

But for the most part considering the strength of schedule I don't think we've done all that bad. 

We obviously could have done better. Perhaps ""should"" have done better. But now that the schedule gets a little bit easier I think we will pick things up. 

Last year after 6 games we had 3 wins, 1 tie and 2 losses. This year we swapped 1 loss for a tie. But basically it's an identical start. We are in a much tougher European group. Last year at this point we also lost to Bayern but had a W against Viktoria Plzn. I'm pretty sure we would have beaten them this year as well. And Roma would have given us trouble last year as well.

So all in all. Nothing has really changed. I think we are going to pick it up and play a lot better. The quality on this team always shows.

Basically, I'm curious just how debilitating it really is. From what I've read, there are different grades -- a grade one strain/tear can have you out 2-3 weeks, while a grade two strain/tear (like Sturridge's, apparently) sees players miss 4-6 weeks time. And then there's a grade three complete tear, like the one Aaron Ramsey had last season, which sees players miss up to three months.

What I'm **really** curious about is whether, upon recovery, there were any lingering effects from the muscle injury that meant you either were unable or chose not push yourself as hard -- like resisting the urge to hit top speed on a sprint out of fear (real or not) of aggravating things. As you can probably guess, I'm curious because I do fear the potential of this injury -- the latest in a string of muscle strains in Daniel's career -- potentially inhibiting the brilliant pace which is so key to his game.

The Differences (according to the Press Release):

* Terrorists and serious criminals who pose a significant threat to the security and safety of UK citizens would lose their right to stay here under Human Rights Laws.  
* People who commit serious crimes in the UK, and in doing so infringe upon the basic rights of others, should lose their right to claim the right to stay here under the right to family life. So for example, a foreign criminal, guilty of causing death by dangerous driving and so taking away the rights of another citizen, would not be able to claim family rights to stay in the UK.  
* No one would be able to claim human rights to allow them to step outside the law that applies to all other citizens, for example a group of travellers claiming the right to family life to breach planning laws.  
* The right to family life would be much more limited in scope. For example an illegal immigrant would not be able to claim the right to family life to stay in the UK because he had fathered children here when he is playing no active part in the upbringing of those children.  
* Limit the reach of human rights cases to the UK, so that British Armed forces overseas are not subject to persistent human rights claims that undermine their ability to do their job and keep us safe.

It started when I had the email confirming my interview. I applied for a job as a retail assistant, the guy on the phone said store assistant but the email that was sent said it was for organising promotional events.

The ad said it was £15,000-£18,000 per year. The guy on the phone said it was a ""competitive rate"". The email said it was commission only. 

I started to dig around online and found people describing it as a shoddy pyramid scheme that lures in 18-23 year olds with the promise of Money and training but then springs the £0 wage and forces them to do 8 hours of door to door sales.

First, sorry that this is an alt. I mod many popular subreddits and do not want my location nor age getting out to the public, as doxxing can be an issue. Hope that isn't a problem!

So, I didn't do so great in my GCSEs (3A*, 6 A, 1B) due to a mixture of laziness and my own arrogance that i'd ace the exams with virtually no work (luckily i've learned my lesson now and AS has been going brilliantly) I guess you could say that Cambridge has always been my ultimate aim, however I am very worried that i've blown that dream out of the water with a less than amazing set of GCSEs. 

However, my teachers are all initially predicting me As for my AS subjects (Maths, Chemistry, Biology, Physics and EPQ) so perhaps my dream is not fully dead in the water yet...

I would love to do NatSci at Cambridge, and looking at what i've told you can **any** Cambridge related person answer these questions:

- Is my dream dead?
- Are any collages unreachable due to my poor grades?
- What can I do the perhaps ""boost"" myself up after getting those grades?
- Is there anything else I can do to help myself, generally?
- Any other tips? Stories like mine?

Many thanks, any other advice/tips in general will be much, much appreciated.

Also, I was given an Arkwright scholarship (a prestigious engineering award, given to 300 people a year). This may help?

Many thanks,

-Thanks to Windy once again for doing the AMA! We will keep that sticky'd for now, but if I could shamelessly appeal to everyone to upvote this thread so people can find it easier, that would be great.

-Also jump on ITV now if you want to hear Sherwood and Les on pregame. The host claimed Pochettino hadn't started well but credit to Tim for defending Poch by arguing that he has continued to bring youth into the team and hasn't started poorly.

-I hope no one is eating any Asian food, otherwise it's your fault if we don't get 3 points. I myself just ate 3 hot dogs incredibly quickly which was probably a mistake. What is everyone snacking on? 

-Hoping for a good performance at the Lane today! The Besiktas fans will be loud and they will be rowdy. So let's shut them up on the pitch. 

-We really need to dominate the midfield tonight, Stambouli and Bentaleb I'm looking at you. We also need to keep an eye on Demba Ba, we all know he has quality. I like Fazio matching up on him, that will definitely be a battle.

-**COME ON YOU SPURS**



---------------------------------------------------
First Half:
----------------

Kickoff

2' Vlad's already started. He gives it away to Olcay who is through on goal but puts it past the right post. Besiktas fans are creating quite the noise. Loud and bouncing.

6' Demba Ba earns a yellow card for elbowing Chiriches in the air. Looks a bit harsh from the ref.

8' Now Ben Davies goes in the book for a late tackle.  Resulting free kick is taken short and Besiktas are caught offside.

11' Sloppy passing by Bentaleb knocks the ball needlessly out of play. On the resulting attack Besiktas drive to the right endline and a cross deflects off Fazio for a corner. The corner is then strongly headed clear by Fazio.

12' Demba Ba receives a cross in the box and blasts off the post/crossbar. He originally took a poor touch in the box but had the ball right in front of Lloris before his touch let him down.

15' Good pressing from Ben Davies to win the ball back. He eventually sends a cross in but it's cleared and deflected off Soldado for a goal kick. Nice to see Davies winning the ball back quickly there.

19' Nice patient build up on the left from our boys. Field was switched and Dier almost found himself in the box but he couldn't control a deflection. Goal kick.

20' Dangerous Besiktas cross hung up for Ba, but Hugo does very well to come out and claim confidently.

22' A long ball goes over Davies head to Gokhan. Gokhan dances in the box but puts a shot harmlessly wide.

27' **TOTTENHAM GOAL (KANE 1-0)** [GIF](http://gfycat.com/BadGratefulArmadillo) What a goal from Harry Kane!!! Bentaleb makes a nice turn and finds Kane at about 30 yards out. Kane takes a few touches and unleashes a beautiful left footed shot into the side netting!! No chance for Tolga, what a strike that was. 

29' Alarms are ringing around London, apparently the city is expecting a massive category 5 to land on the banks of the Thames. It seems to be a mystery as to where this sudden storm has originated from.

33' Holy shit what a save by Hugo Lloris. That's why he's one of the 3 best goal keepers in the world. Great football from Besiktas and a cross from the wing is sent in perfectly for Ba. It comes off Ba and finds Olcay who turns it back across the net towards where the cross had come from. Lloris is going the wrong way but he extends his foot just enough and toes it out for a corner. What a kick save, by Hugo.

36' Ben Davies has been very bright to start this one.  He finds space on the left and sends in a great ball for the Category 5, unfortunately Kane mistimes his jump and heads over the bar.

38' Townsend with a nice run finds Kane in the box, Kane gets a hard shot on target but it's saved for a corner. Resulting corner is taken short and comes to nothing.

41' Great ball from Townsend as Paulinho comes running into the box. The Brazilian can't get a touch on it, all it need was some sort of contact and it was in. Very dangerous cross from Townsend.

44' Kane makes a nice tackle in the midfield but is called for a foul. The break would've been on if the ref had gotten that one right.

**Halftime**

-Good stuff from Harry Kane to give us the lead, but this one certainly isn't over yet.

-Tim Sherwood on ITV at halftime once again. He should get an assist on that Bentaleb to Kane goal.

-----------------------------------------------------
Second Half:
-----------------------------------------------------

Kickoff!

47' Poor ball from Chiriches forces Bentaleb into a foul on Hutchinson after losing the ball. It's a yellow for Nabil but nothing comes of the Besiktas free kick.

50' Weird scene as Fazio gets a yellow card in the box, but the ball is still sitting at the corner flag waiting to be taken. Ba tried to run around Fazio after the ref had previously just spoken to both of them. The corner is easily cleared by Spurs.

54' Townsend finds Stambouli from the right side of the field, Benji pulls of a sexy backheel and sort of leaves it for Andros right outside the center of the box. Townsend tries to curl it in with his left but it's past the far post. Pretty football in the buildup though!

55’ Chiriches dives in too early and lets Ba get around him. Ba finds Sohan who smashes it on target. Thank god for Hugo Lloris. Makes another outstanding save. I’ve amended my opinion. Neuer is the only keeper in the world better than Lloris right now.  

57’ Fazio steps in and cleans up for another one of Vlad’s messes. Well done Federico.

59’ Roberto Soldado drops deep and takes a ball on his chest, he turns beautifully and runs from midfield towards the end of the box. He slots it wide for Bentaleb who’s left footed low shot just goes past the far post.

**Tottenham Sub** Aaron Lennon on for Paulinho

64’ Chiriches loses his man in the box, but Sohan decides to attempt the bicycle kick and misses wide. 
 
**Tottenham Sub** Mousa Dembele comes on for Benjamin Stambouli

**Besiktas Sub** Kavlak off for Ozyakup

66’ Kudos to our fans, they’re really loud right now. Been in voice just as much as the Turkish fans have tonight.

68’ Oh my word what a terrible call from the referee. Mousa Dembele makes a driving run onto the edge of the box and goes down after a clear foul. Worthy of a yellow card, that’s some baby-back-bullshit.

69' Wow now Kane gets hacked in the midfield and nothing is called as Besiktas attempt to counter. This ref...

71’ Ben Davies makes another great run down the left, this time he cuts it back for Kane who absolutely smacks it from the top of the box.  Good save by the keeper to knock it down.  

**Besiktas Sub** Sahan off for Pektemek

72' Pektemek immediately gets a free header in the box off a corner, he puts it over. Should've scored.

75’ Some meaningful possession for Spurs over the last couple minutes. Highlighted by an intelligent backheel pass from Soldado in the box to Townsend. Now we see Adebayor about to come on...saving Soldado for the weekend.

76’ OH MY WORD HUGO LLORIS DOES IT AGAIN. Demba Ba is in on goal after a perfect lofted through ball. Hugo comes out and faces Ba and knocks it over the bar. Resulting corner is cleared.

**Tottenham Sub** Emmanuel Adebayor replaces Roberto Soldado. Here’s hoping Soldado gets the start over Ade at the weekend.

**Besiktas Sub** Gokhan Tore off for Kerim

84' Long ball for Ba but he heads it to far near Hugo on his first touch.

85' Besiktas corner after Vlad clears well at the back.

86’ A couple corners in a row for Besiktas. We defended well and earn a goal kick after Demba Ba’s header falling away from goal goes over the crossbar.

88’ **Penalty to Besiktas** Vlad misses a clearance and then touches it with his hand in the box. Penalty is scored. **Besiktas Goal** (Demba Ba 1-1)

**Full Time Tottenham 1-1 Besiktas**

http://www.gazettelive.co.uk/news/teesside-news/a66-roadworks-traffic-flows-freely-7861297

So essentially there are four bridges across the Tees that boundarys Middlesbrough at the North and West.

The famous transporter has been closed for long term repairs. Over the summer Newport bridge was closed for painting. They found structural problems and it hasn't yet reopened.

This leaves only the Tees flyover (A19) going North (which admittedly has the highest capacity, but tends to snarl up quickly as it has a major junction to the South of the river with the A66 (the main road out of town west. The A19 also has roadworks at other major junctions at the moment.

This week the powers that be decided now would be the perfect time to reduce the one functioning road out of town, the A66, down to one lane for resurfacing.

So after gridlock earlier in the week they've thankfully back tracked and reopened the a66.

Still it's bad out there today, what used to take 15-20 mins, just took me an hour to get home, and during these works generally takes 40 mins.

Hopefully Newport bridge opens again at the weekend, so that should alleviate some of the problem, but it might well not if they just reclose the A66 lanes.

I can't figure out who thought it would be a good idea to plan 5 different independent roadworks all at the same time, covering all major exits/entrys to town.

Also I came here cause Reddit is good at answering my questions, though usually not very politely.

I'm Irish, and for some reason the only history we were taught was how England dealt with us for 800 years, like literally my First year history class started with the Norman invasion, and this was in a Catholic school too, as a guy with a love of history that's pretty depressing.  Now currently I'm learning about Scotland and Ulster, or as my lecturer calls it ""Ireland, Scotland and their unruly neighbor"" (he's pretty nationalist), so that means we may probably be addressing the Reformation soon, but I'm impatient.

So I know that the reason Ireland rejected Protestantism in all it's forms was due to the huge influence of the Catholic church, and I know that the reason England accepted their own form of Protestantism was due to the ambitions of Henry VIII, but why did the Stuarts and the people of Scotland accept the change?

My first guess would just be due to church corruption in Scotland, but that seems too simple.  Second guess would be political ambitions of the monarch at the time.  Or maybe it was a mixture of both.

We *will* win the league under Brendan Rodgers. Our team is filled with young stars who are just waiting to spawn into beautiful butterflies. Just give it time guys, and YNWA 


I'm kidding.. we're shite. Rodgers is suddenly incapable of doing literally anything right, we won't make top 4 if we continue like this (we'll get *relegated* if we carry on like this FFS!), and he's wasted all the transfer money on garbage.

Don't be either of these people. We don't need hopelessly optimistic people offering 'perspective' that we didn't ask for after every loss, nor do we need people making snap judgements and sweeping generalizations about our players and future. There is ups and downs supporting a football club, especially ours (that's what they all say), so let's not be pathetic cunts about it for fucks sake. Opinions and *constructive* criticisms are good, don't get me wrong; what the fuck would we talk about otherwise?! And being optimistic and getting behind the side *is* actually the essence of being a supporter. BUT losing your heads and writing us off before it has even begun is nuts, just as plugging your ears and offering other fans naively optimistic, fucking rally call type posts is pure twatbag behaviour also. And what's with the ""Guys, I'm starting to get worried"" posts.. There is no circle, it isn't your turn to talk, and you didn't put your fucking hand up. We don't give a shit that you're worried. 

There IS something wrong with the side, and it will be fixed. When? Well who fucking knows. Criticize away, but do it constructively and avoid fucking pathetic pointless statements alluding to Rodger's job and ""if we carry on like this we won't make top 4"". Here's my opinion, for instance; our midfield is the *biggest* problem right now. Attack will fall into place with Sturridge returning and more time for new-comers to settle AS LONG AS we get some control in the midfield. Diamond or 4-3-3 best for this since 4-2-3-1 suits no-one. Gerrard needs to be managed better and Hendo should never be playing in a two next to him. If I had my way I'd have Allen-Hendo-Lallana. There you go.

My last order didn't arrive, but the online tracking said it was 'delivered and signed for by MR WASP' so I had a right game convincing them otherwise. I emailed about four times before getting a reply, which came from some sort of automated reply robot which had obviously skimmed my email and replied to the parts that it understood, which made their reply nonsensical and irrelevant.

They sent me a replacement, I waited at home today and saw the driver deliver it to another house - the wrong address and an empty property. He denied it was the wrong address, then admitted it was but explained he ""only gets pennies per delivery and doesn't have time to read the address properly"". He added that ""to be honest mate and I shouldn't say this, Amazon are wankers, you shouldn't use them, they used to be ok when they used Royal Mail but now RM won't touch them"", and then he drove off.

The house is empty but has a For Sale sign so I rang the estate agents, explained, and they agreed to meet me tomorrow and let me have my parcel(s). I then checked the tracking and sure enough, 'delivered and signed for by MR WASP'. The delivery guy lied that it was a completed delivery. Rather than complain I'll just get my stuff, send them one back, and then close the account so I don't get tempted again.

So, I've had it with them. 

The tax avoidance should've been enough but I persisted, but after seeing that their delivery methods are this bad, and trying to make a complaint is so ridiculously hard, I'll buy all my books from bookstore, pay the extra but get the item there and then, in my hand.

But, are there any affiliated companies that I will lose access to if I close the account? I had a look on their site and read the wiki page and I don't see any that I use. I don't use Audible or Lovefilm, so I think I'm ok.

My skin does feel and look a lot smoother and a bit more radiant since I first found SCA a few months ago. I bought the Stridex pads, and have been militant about taking off make-up and using suncream daily, so that has helped. However, my pores are still HUGE and I think I've been causing my skin to produce more oil. So I decided to have a change and try out the OCM. I'm not sure if I'm doing it right, so if you could check and let me know if I'm missing anything/doing something stupid!



AM: 

Splash with water or use tea tree scrub if feeling dirty

Moisturise - Simple Replenishing Rich Moisturiser

Sun cream - Avon Bronze sun protection anti-shine face cream SPF20


PM:

OCM with coconut oil

Stridex Max strength (1/2 pad)

Argon Oil serum

Vaseline


My main concerns are:

1) Should I be doing more in the morning? I used to use 1/2 Stridex pad morning and night.

2) What would be a better cleanser for the morning than the tea tree scrub? (cheap thing I picked up at Boots and have been using for a long time)

3) What's a good (not too expensive) sun cream to use, as mine is running out?

i lost count of how many times he tried the ""collect pass from player on right, then move left and shoot"" move today. he had many other options each time, and he doesn't have the same shot accuracy that Bale did from that range. 

being ""selfish"" isn't necessarily bad...if you score goals. when Defoe was in his prime, he'd take numerous failed or risky shots. the thing was, he converted enough of them. townsend has scored 5 goals in 54 Spurs appearances. while I know wingers aren't always supposed to be the team leader in goals, Townsend shoots at the expense of being productive otherwise. 

he's had so many chances and opportunities to improve, and he just hasn't. he's exactly the same player he's always been. i hope i'm wrong. we all know how Bale was middling at first and adapted and improved. but given all I've seen, townsend doesn't deserve to start over Lennon in Europa games unless he cuts this shit out.

I expected him to leave last summer and was overjoyed when we managed to keep hold of him, but I can't see us keeping him for much longer if we carry on playing like this. For me, he's one of the top 5 keepers in the world and there are loads of clubs in the Champions League who would snap him up in an instant, and he's playing behind players like Chiriches and Ben Davies.

There's a real dearth of quality throughout the squad. We did well over the summer in getting cover for positions, but in terms of overall first team quality we've taken a step back. There are very, very few players in the squad who could be described as top quality Premiership players, let alone world-class players. It feels like nearly every player we've signed since Bale left has been disappointing. There's still Spurs fans out there desperately proclaiming that Soldado has been a good signing, and that Lamela can be better than Bale. I'm not saying that the players are shit or that we'll get relegated, but the honest truth is that we've got lots and lots of quite good players, and very few great players. 

Before you all start downvoting me for being negative, I live in north London, I've been a Spurs fan all my life, and I know how shit we were in the pre-ENIC era. This team is clearly much better than that. But it's also clear that we had a brief window of brilliance, where for once we had the right manager (Redknapp, who I can't stand and who has been rubbish at QPR), and a clutch of truly great players (Bale, Modric, VDV, King). Every season since then has been a slight backwards step until we suddenly realise that for all our talk of Champions League football, we've got a squad that is barely good enough to get us into the top 6. 

I really hope that at the end of the season we finish in the top four and I have to eat my words, but I don't see it happening.",false,coys,t5_2ryq7,null,null,self,I feel so sorry for Lloris,13,http://www.reddit.com/r/coys/comments/2i4nqk/i_feel_so_sorry_for_lloris/

**Disclaimer: I'm not claiming that I'm right on any of these. Feel free to discuss and prove me wrong. I'm just adding some of my points of view from what I've seen around here.**

***

***Emanuel Adebayor:***

There is definitely a lot of animosity towards Ade around here. I'll admit that I'm a huge supporter of his, so I'm possibly quite biased. With Adebayor, I really don't know what people want. He gets criticized for dropping too deep to help build up play. He gets criticized for walking around up top waiting for the ball to come to him to hold it up. He gets criticized for tiring out. He gets criticized for everything he does, which is totally unfair.

One thing that really bothers me is the criticism of his work rate. I see a lot of fans stating that he has been very lazy and I just can't see that. It makes absolutely no sense to me. If anything, he looks absolutely exhausted out there and, for me, that is a sign of hard work, not laziness. Chastise his play, not his work rate. If he's getting tired out there and walking around, it should be Pochettino substituting him or not playing him.

***

***Roberto Soldado:***

Now, there isn't a lot of criticism of Soldado around here and I can see why that is. Personally, I'm not overly impressed with Soldado anymore but I can see where others are coming from. He hasn't had a proper chance or played to his strengths. When he plays there is sparks here and there of good play. He has a lot of flair which helps him avoid criticism. Roberto also has some good chemistry with Lamela obviously so I can see many people wanting that to translate to on the pitch in the PL.

I haven't much else to say about him, because I'm not calling for his start. But I want to be fair and defend him from his few (vocal) doubters (me included).

***

***Vlad Chiricheș:***

There is a lot (**A LOT**) of hostility towards Vlad right now. Maybe after these two games, rightly so. But, the fact is, he is not nearly as bad as everyone is claiming right now. I'd like to point out that he is coming off a back injury still because those are niggling injuries that hang around for a long time (Just like Lamela was, who everyone was happy to give the benefit of the doubt, I might add.) and he's being tossed around between right and left center back every game. 

On the notion of double standards between players, I'll compare him to Vertonghen and Lloris instead of Lamela since opinions can differ between attackers and defenders. Firstly, Vertonghen. Jan is probably the center back we have that is most similar to Vlad since they are both extremely comfortable on the ball and they like to roam forward. Fans applaud Jan's propensity to maraude forward with the ball but react poorly to Vlad's bombing runs forward. I'm not sure why this is, because he gets back quicker than Jan does to cover. Secondly, put your pitchforks away for me comparing him and Lloris. I'm not suggesting that Vlad is anywhere near Hugo's quality but I'd like to point out that Lloris is also very casual on the ball (a huge complaint about Vlad I see) and Lloris makes many risky attempts at the ball that he, luckily, has the ability to come out of on the winning side most of the time. Vlad is similar with his casual-ness with the ball and riskiness, but he's chastised for it.

Last season he was one of our better performing center backs before his injury. Players like Soldado who haven't exactly lit it up for Spurs are defended because he hasn't had a proper run, but Vlad hasn't had a proper run of games either so he's berated for his poor form? Very confusing. If anyone had watched him with Steaua in the Champion's and Europa League then they would know he is a quality player. There is a reason he is Romania's captain. I think a lot of the opinions on Vlad are reactionary and short minded.

***

***Paulinho:***

Paulinho is a tough one. He hasn't played well for us at all and I wonder what is up with him. Because he was an absolute monster for Brazil in the Confederations Cup. I'm very critical of him myself and he's played extremely poorly but there's always that chance he shows up for a game and plays everyone off the pitch. He definitely has a scoring touch and that's a useful trait to have as a player. We did him absolutely no good by playing him on the wing today. That was a baffling decision for me. But he did work hard and put in a decent defensive display.

***

***Ben Davies:***

Davies has not really played as well as all of us had hoped he would. The most beneficial thing he has done for us is light a fire under Rose's ass. His delivery has been off lately which is uncharacteristic of him from I've seen of his play at Swansea. There were a few good crosses in today, which is better than his last Europa appearance. All I have to say is that he's young and will grow into the position and prove to be a great left back. 

***

***Andros Townsend:***

Townsend. He has the potential and tool set to become a top, top winger. But he's not really capitalized on his ability yet. If reports are true about him absolutely killing it in training and forgetting it all on matchday, then I have high, high hopes for him. It's just a matter of experience and maturity. If we give him the gametime, he will deliver for us in the future. Too many fans want instant success I think, but patience with some of our players (Townsend and Chiricheș for example) will really pay off for the club, in my opinion.

***

I could continue on with more players, but I'd like to get this posted because I'm tired of typing. Once again, I'm not claiming to be right. These are my opinions and you are all entitled to your own. I'd just like to ask that in this thread we keep it civil and try to explain why we think one way or the other.

Not that the show was ever meant to be watertight, and I get they want something lighter to balance Capaldi's age and gravitas.

  But things like the silly robin hood golden arrow being shot at the spaceship to save the day.  Or the doctor leaping (three's company style) to the conclusion of who Jenna's boyfriend was, and her not realizing his confusion even though he was half a step behind them making insinuating comments while she walked with the other English teacher.

  I feel that allowing these plot holes in the name of humor or a lighter tone is affecting the quality of the scripts overall.  For instance, I didn't feel the tension between Danny and the Doctor was handled very well, but seemed like it went the way it did largely because ""well, the story arc says they don't get along for a while here, so ...""

  Or the idea that Clara, despite always having played the character as someone who is confident of her looks and her impact on people, is supposed to act like a bumbling shut-in when it comes to the prospect of going on a date with Danny.  (""Well, it will play well to the teenage demographic."")

My biggest problem at the moment that I can see will be where I keep my bike.  Our house had the garage converted before we moved in, and the garden is three tiered and the bottom isnt big enough for a shed.

The bike would have to go either outside the front of the house, or round the side between ours and next door (no lighting, pitch black at night)

Any suggestions for storage/security with keeping a bike outside year round ? I know its not ideal, but I cant think of another way round it.

Posted from my blog [which can be found here.](http://chicoandhisleftpeg.blogspot.com/2014/10/rangers-v-hibernian-29092014.html)

**Starting Line-ups**

**Rangers**

Simonsen – GK, McGregor-RB, McCulloch-CB, Mohsni-CB, Wallace-
LB, Peralta-RM, Black-CM, Law-CM, Smith-LM, Boyd-FC, Shiels-FC



They started with Mohsni and McCulloch at centre back, which is a very odd pairing given that Mohsni is at his best when closing down the ball, and McCulloch is much better sitting deep. This created an issue of space that Hibs would exploit. They played a 4-4-2, which at times turned to a 4-4-1-1 with Shiels dropping very deep to pick up the ball, trying to spread the play.
                                                                       


**Hibernian**

Oxley-GK, Forster-CB, Hanlon-CB, Nelson-CB, Gray-RWB/RM, Craig-CM, Robertson-CM, Allan-CM, Stevenson-LWB/LM, Malonga-FC, Cummings-CF

Hibs set out in a 3-5-2 shape, which looked more dynamic, and also allowed at least one central defender to be free from having to man mark the two Rangers’ strikers. This was a very smart tactical move from Stubbs to stifen the Rangers attack.

                                                             
**Tactical Deployment**

Hibs were constantly re-adjusting themselves to Rangers’ attacks, and pressing whoever had the ball. There were some Rangers players willing to press, but they seemed few and far between when Rangers were without the ball. This could have been because of the pace- or lack thereof- of McCulloch. He could not keep up with the tempo of the game, nor does he suit a high line defence.

Indeed, it’s difficult to see where McCulloch fits in this team (or whether he does at all), unless it’s in a trio of midfielders with Kyle Hutton doing the running for him. I am quite amazed Hutton didn’t start, and maybe someone can tell me if he’s been playing poorly or why he didn't start and what are the other options at centre back? When I last seen Hutton play (he’s been on loan at Thistle before) he was excellent, he showed how much energy and stamina he has and really works hard for the team. 







Ian Black just does not provide enough, and you really have to question his inclusion in the side especially when, in my opinion, Hutton could do this job to a far greater effect without constantly fouling the opposition.

Rangers actually had the better of the first 25 minutes, passing it around comfortably at the back and exploiting space behind the Hibernian wing backs, especially down the left hand side where Gray was leaving space behind him while attacking. 


Rangers actually had the better of the first 25 minutes, passing it around comfortably at the back and exploiting space behind the Hibernian wing backs, especially down the left hand side where ~~Craig did not look too comfortable at right wing back.~~ Gray was leaving space behind him while attacking.  A large talking point came from Cummings’ challenge on Black, which to me could have resulted in a red card given a stricter referee; it was not a good challenge. 

**Main Action**


For the first Hibs goal it is a massive punt over the top from Oxley, who excelently spotted the run of Cumings. With no one marking him and only Peralta chasing back in a vain hope of dispossessing Cummings, there was only going to be one winner to that ball. It remains to be seen why at least one of the defenders or defensive midfielders were not back in case of a quick counter attack. People may blame Peralta, but quite frankly that hides the problem of why he (a quick right winger) was left to be the player to chase Cummings in the first place, he should not have been left in that situation. Normally you expect to see a full back or defensive midfielder remain deep while the team attacks a set piece to take care of any potential problems.

For the second goal it is never cleared properly, nor are any Rangers players closing down the ball when it comes back out for the cross in. That being said the cross is fantastic, and Gray’s run towards the back post is excellently timed, with Smith being comprehensively beaten for the header. 

The third stems from another counter attack and an absolutely wonderful piece of close control from Malonga, who had barely had a touch before this, taking it round two players before playing a nice pass in-between the space of Mohsni and McGregor (both of whom, at this point, were less than convincing despite being very good in the first 25 minutes). The ball is simply cut inside and it’s an easy but accurate finish from Cummings to direct it into the corner. 

**Importance of specific players**

In all honesty, I was very surprised by the score line at this point given Rangers’ dominance in the first 25 minutes, despite the lack of a very clear chance they seemed in control. Stevenson getting forward was a massive contributing factor in this; he provided excellent width and was involved in the second two goals. Also Malonga was much better after the 30 minute mark, utilising his dribbling and close control to hold the ball up or to create space for a counter attack.

It’s funny to me that Hibs seem to have two first choice left wing backs in Booth and Stevenson, yet I don’t think they have a natural right wing back (can someone confirm this? **confirmed**). Stevenson switched to the right in the second half, which meant that Stubbs clearly recognised the weak point in the first half. Booth came on for Gray, ~~and Craig switched to the central of midfield, which made more sense given his natural skill set involves passing and finding space and this put a hindrance on the threat Rangers posed down that flank.~~

Malonga again caused problems with his running and dribbling in the second half, and was unlucky to not gain a penalty after McCulloch took the ball over the line with his arm. Malonga continually chased the ball up front for Hibs, and by the end of the game he looked exhausted but was still giving everything he had. 

Nicky Law’s goal was spectacular, his run to the outside of the box wasn’t being marked tightly enough and he side foots it on the half volley. It curls away from Oxley and, although he gets a hand to it, there’s enough power on it to get past him. Straight after this Mohsni seemed to get himself in a tangle and appeared to head butt a Hibs player, although this was missed by the referee. 

Mohsni was quite good at closing players down. Disappointingly for Rangers this didn’t seem to fit in with the narrative of the rest of the team, especially given the lack of pace in the middle. This, however, is in contrast with the fact that Mohsni was consistently losing his marker, and was at a loss positional wise for the third Hibs goal, adding to the that he is sometimes careless with possession. 

With Rangers pressing and Hibs defending well the clear goal scoring chances were limited, but both teams continued attacking, especially down the flanks. With Booth continuing the trend from the first half down the left, and Aird (who replaced Peralta at half time) down the right flank driving inside and causing a number of Hibs players to commit to closing him down, to try and create space. 

**The three man defence**

The Hibs three man defence, however, was more than up to the challenge of clearing crosses and blocking long range shots. The tactics that Stubbs used in this game were absolutely perfect.

With roughly ten minutes to go Boyd also puts in a head butt, although it could be argued he was provoked. Forster does stick his face right in Boyd’s face, but this does not excuse the attempted head butt. Either way neither Forster or Boyd comes away from that looking good from the incident. 

Finally with only five minutes to go there was another chance for the Hibs back three to show their versatility with defending, with all of them stepping up in front of Boyd making sure he was offside when the cross came in to the box. Towards the end Hibs were playing with more of a back five than a back three, although this was a sensible choice given the attacking talent that Rangers have at their disposal. 

**Conclusions**

Overall this was a very exciting game for a neutral. The set-up of Hibernian ensured this was a performance to remember as they limited Rangers to chances from either outside the box or set pieces, and exploited the space that Rangers left. That being said Rangers were actually very good in the first 25 minutes, but their tactical choices were bemusing given that they had (and knew they would have) most of the possession. I think they could benefit from playing someone who is more adapt to passing the ball in the middle of the park. 

Edit: Mistake in lineup of Hibs, Craig did not play RWB, Gray did. Also fixing errors to do with this throughout the report. Thanks to /u/78523985212369874 for pointing it out.

I've seen comments saying we should replace him by December if things aren't going smoothly.

It has literally been 6 weeks of not living up to the standards HE has set since his reign took over. 

Two years of magnificent work have earned him a blip on the radar. Go back a year and we were a bigger joke than United. We were literally made fun of as standard protocol between every set of fans in how shit we were. 

There's a line between both blind loyalty and knee-jerk reactionary abuse. There's too much of both on here. When we're doing well he's the new Shankly and when we hit a rough patch he's an egotistical tactically challenged pleb. 

He warrants criticism, but I'm not even close to being near thinking of getting a new manager. Stability is what we need. We have a hugely unstable squad, we don't need backroom changes too. 

I feel he is paying the price for his own over-achievements last season. 

He isn't perfect, but he is young and talented. I don't know too many respected managers that aren't egotistical, you have to have belief in your own philosophies to make it.

I don't think Rodgers knows how to best use the new players we have now at our disposal. He made lots of changes to our formation last year when it became apparent Sturridge and Suarez both had to play, and Lucas and Gerrard didn't work anymore. 

We went through lots of variations of formations and over the course of 2013 went from playing possession based football to swift counter-attacking football. He does tinker, and hopefully he will figure out a winning formula again soon.

It's really frustrating to see the same people that mock Arsenal fans ""Wenger out"" after a run of poor form  turn on our own manager after 6 weeks of poor form after major squad alterations.

so questions for my more experienced two wheeled 

is there a temporary repair i can do myself as i don't have any money left now?

is riding the bike with a crack in the muffler going to damage the engine?

can i take a mod 2 test with this issue, or will i need to repair it (i assume it would fail an MOT)?

what do i do to avoid the wrath of the wife when she finds out i need to spend more money on the bike?

Remember me? 

I wrote this post ""[Welcome to Krasnodar (from Russian LFC supporter)](http://redd.it/2fwaiz)"" some weeks ago.

What we see yestarday? Perfect pitch, full statium and good game! Honestly, I'll wonder like Krasnodar plays. When u see Russian Premier league, you think: they play nice, but class of RPL is lower than EPL. But yestarday I saw like Krasnodar dominate against team from EPL! 

I watch the match and thinking. Why Liverpool not plays like Krasnodar in last weekend?? 

I wrote later that FC Krasnodar's history is poor. Club was founded in 2008. But statium was full. It's like a dream for most of us. We loves football in Krasnodar. And I'm so sad that our city is not in a member list cities of World Cup 2018 in Russia.

I'm getting quite excited after the past couple of months of football we've had, I keep looking at the league table to check I'm not dreaming. Seeing Southampton play competitive games in Europe is something I've only been able to dream about but this season more than ever it's looking like a distinct possibility. We weren't too far off Europa League positions last year and although a lot of fans dislike playing in it due to the sheer amount of extra games, nothing would get me more excited than to be able to travel across Europe and see the Saints battle it out. But it wouldn't be the first time, today I'll be looking at the previous occasions the Saints have crossed the border (not including league matches vs Swansea and Cardiff!)

1969 -1970 | Inter Cities Fairs Cup
---
---
After finishing seventh the previous season, Ted Bates' Southampton qualified for their first ever European competition. The 'Inter-Cities Fairs Cup' was essentially a very early Europa League but without group stages meaning it was knockout from the very start. Starting in the first round with 64 teams, each match was a two-legged affair with the away goals rule in effect. 

**First Round:**
In the first round, Southampton drew Norwegian side Rosenborg who are one of the most successful sides in Northern Europe having played in over 200 competitive European matches. We lost 1-0 away but managed to overcome the deficit at home in front of 22,000 and progress to Second Round after goals from Ron Davies and Terry Paine. 

**Second Round:**
Southampton met the Portuguese outfit Vitória de Guimarães in the Round of 32 a month later and once again travelled away from home in the first leg. It proved to be an extremely competitive 90 minutes as Davies and Paine doubled their European goal tally and Channon got his name on the scoresheet, it finished 3-3. But the home support for the Saints prevailed as we won a whopping 5-1 to win 8-4 on aggregate. Two goals from Davies as well as strikes from Jimmy Gabriel and Mick Channon finished off with a Portugese own goal sealed the deal as Southampton continued their fine run of form into the Third Round. 

**Third Round:** 
The Saints met fellow English First Division side Newcastle United in last 16 and for the third time in a row travelled away in the first leg (Sound familiar?) and drew 0-0. An incredible 25,000 fans came to support Southampton in the second leg but despite Mick Channon's opener, the game finished 1-1 and Southampton were eliminated on away goals leaving Newcastle to progress to the Quarter-Finals. Arsenal would go on to beat Anderlecht in the Final. 

---
1971 - 1972 | UEFA Cup
---
---
Southampton finished seventh once again in the previous season and qualified for European football for a second time. In the two years since they last played, the name had changed somewhat as UEFA organised the European competition for the first time replacing the Fairs Cup. It still remained the same format however. 

**First Round:** Athletic Bilbao travelled to The Dell in September in what was the first time Southampton had faced Spanish opposition. Antonio Arieta opened up the scoring for the visitors midway into the second half but just six minutes later Thomas Jenkins equalised for the Saints. Things got even better for the home side as a few minutes after going level Saints were awarded a penalty which Mick Channon calmly finished to take the lead. Southampton hung on for the final 20 minutes and the match finished 2-1. Things were looking promising as a fortnight later the second leg was 0-0 in Bilbao. But with just 20 minutes to go, the home side took the lead making it 2-2 on aggregate. As it stood, Southampton would be eliminated for the second consecutive European match on away goals but on the 90th minute Arieta scored again to clinch the win and see Southampton fall out in the first round. Spurs would go on to win the final vs Wolves. 

---
1976 - 1977 | European Cup Winners Cup
---
---
1976 saw what is arguably Southampton's finest achievement; winning the FA Cup. As well as another trip to Wembley in the FA Charity Shield (We lost 1-0 to Liverpool), this also allowed us to play in the European Cup Winners Cup. This was a competition in which the 32 winners of major National Cups across Europe would compete for an even higher accolade. It was an extremely well regarded competition although after 40 years it was cancelled due to the rise of the Champions League. 

**First Round:** Southampton hosted Olympique Marseille in the first leg who had won the Coupe de France the previous season. The first 30 minutes proved to be a close affair but the French had a nightmare five minutes as they conceded on three separate occasions before half time. Waldron, Channon and Osgood all taking their chances without hesitation. The second half was extremely controlled and routine but the Saints managed to extend their lead via a Channon spotkick. The first leg finished 4-0. The return leg saw Marseille win 2-1 and Southampton progressed to the second round with a 5-2 aggregate. 

**Second Round:** The Saints were drawn against a British team in the last 16; Carrick Rangers FC from Northern Ireland who had won the Irish Cup the previous season. Carrick had defeated Dutch side Aris Bonnevoie 4-3 in the previous round. Southampton travelled to Northern Ireland mid-October and took the lead within 10 minutes with a strike from Robert Stokes. The second half proved to be a goal fest with Carrick equalising from the restart and Southampton knocking in another three (Channon, Osgood and McCalliog); it finished 5-2 to the Saints. Carrick had a large deficit of away goals to make up in the second leg but Southampton took full advantage of their attacking style and won the game 4-1 to progress into the Quarter-Finals with a 9-3 aggregate. 

**Quarter-Finals:** This was the first and only time Southampton had ever progressed to the final eight of a European tournament and good grief were they given a tough draw. Belgian side Anderlecht stood between us and the semi-finals but they had won this competition the previous season and were in mighty form after thrasing the Turkish side Galatasary 10-2 in the previous round. Playing the first leg away from home, we lost 2-0 and struggled to get anything going. However when playing at the Dell, Saints pulled out all the stops and managed to get 2-0 up by the 77th minute thanks to a David Peach penalty and MacDougall. But just as thing were looking up, Anderlecht grabbed a late goal to progress to the Semis with a 3-2 aggregate score. 

---
1981 - 1982 | UEFA Cup
---
---
After finish 6th in the top flight the previous season, Southampton qualified for the UEFA cup for the first time in 10 years. 

**First Round:** The Saints faced Limerick United from Ireland and got a comfortable win 3-0 away in the first leg (a brace from Stephen Moran and one from David Armstrong) but were kept to a 1-1 draw at the Dell in the return leg which saw Kevin Keegan get his first European goal for Southampton. 

**Second Round:** Southampton hosted Portuguese opposition for the second time as they drew Sporting Lisbon in the Round of 32. By half time, Sporting were up 3-0 at the Dell and things were looking bleak. Keegan and Channon fired home to claw back to 3-2 but another goal in stoppage time made it a tall order for the Saints who needed to win by three goals in Lisbon to progress through. They played well and kept a clean sheet but couldn't get any in the back of the net themselves. The aggregate score finished at 4-2 to Sporting. 

---
1982 - 1983 | UEFA Cup
---
---
Another strong league finish (7th place) meant that for the first time Southampton qualified for Europe in two consecutive seasons. 

**First Round:** IFK Norrköping from Sweden visited the Dell to be the second team from Scandinavia since Rosenborg in the Fairs Cup. The visitors took the lead shortly into the second half before David Armstrong fired in the equaliser. In what was becoming a trend, the Saints conceded with just a few minutes left but moments later Mark Wright tied it up 2-2. On the return leg, Southampton were held to a scoreless draw and left the competition on away goals. 

---
1984 - 1985 | UEFA Cup
---
---
The 1983-84 season was the most successful the club has ever seen. Finishing second just three points behind the league winners Liverpool was an astonishing achievement. 

**First Round:** German football came to Southampton for the first time in the form of Hamburg who were runners up in their league. The first leg was a rather uninspiring 0-0 that saw not a single shot on target from either team. During the visit to Germany, it was yet another dull game until Southampton conceded a penalty deep into the second half to give Hamburg the lead. A 90th minute goal doubled their lead and once again, the Saints were left without an effort on goal. 

---
2003 - 2004 | UEFA Cup
---
---
After almost 20 years without playing in Europe, Southampton found themselves back in the UEFA Cup courtesy of finishing runners up in the previous FA Cup as Arsenal had already booked their place via the league. 

**First Round:** In what would be not just the first time Southampton faced an Eastern European side, it would also be the first competitive match the Saints would play at their new home against a non-English team. Steaua București from Romania travelled to the recently opened St. Mary's and opened the scoring within 20 minutes. But Southampton spurred on and got the equaliser in the second half to draw the match at 1-1. On the return leg, Southampton held strong but it was once again a late goal that struck the final blow to see Southampton knocked out of European competition.

2015 - 2016 | Champions Leagu...oh who am I kidding? Europa League?
---
---
So there we go! A brief overview of our galavanting around the continent. We've had a good few runs, notably in the Cup Winners Cup and we've face some strong teams over the years and only just lost narrowly in the majority of them. 

Is it likely we finish high enough to qualify for European football this year? I'm not sure whether 'likely' is the correct term, it's a definite possibility and I'd say we have the highest chance of qualifying via the league since we last did it in 1984. 30 years without a proper foray into Europe is a long time. There's a strong amount of supporters who would rather not be in the Europa League due to the sheer amount of extra matches that have to be played and have the mindset of 'If it's not the Champions League then I don't want it.' That's a great shame because to be playing against top teams across Europe is something most clubs can only dream of including Southampton despite the fact we had a couple of short runs 30 years ago. Now that there's a significant group stage before the knockout rounds, you're guaranteed more than one home game and that'd be wonderful. 

Just look at some of the teams in the Europa League this year. Villareal, Lille, Inter Milan, Celtic... these are huge European teams with a long history of European competition. To have the chance to host competitive matches against them would be incredible! Not forgetting the fact that teams who finish third in their Champions League group will play in the Europe league. It's a genuine possibility that you could face Juventus, Benfica, Monaco, Roma, Ajax, PSG...how are people not excited for this?! We were playing Hartlepool a few seasons ago! (No offense to any Hartlepool fans but you get my point!)

The negatives are that it has a huge effect on the fitness of the squad. With so many extra games, it's easy to pick up injuries and have players be worn out prior to league games. But then it also helps encourage better players to come to the club, how can they look at us and say we have no ambition if we're making into Europe? It gives a huge opportunity to improve squad depth as well as a lot more international coverage and the money that goes with it. I'd bloody love us to play in Europe and having spent several days researching our previous expeditions, it only makes me want it even more! Lets not be pessimistic, bring it on Europe!

Just had a quick thought of what is to come on the upcoming episode, “Kill The Moon”.. 
Wanted to see what everyone else thinks. :) 

***    


**[WARNING - Potential Spoilers below if you haven't seen up to S8Ep6]**



   I’m hoping that this episode will somehow end like the “Fires of Pompeii’s” conclusion. The same way that Donna became cognizant of how arduous the 10th doctor’s decisions are – like choosing entire civilizations vs the assurance of a single, yet-innocent life, Clara will also be forced to understand how challenging it is to be the Doctor. Clara will be put through similar trials which will lead her to choose saving an innocent life vs the future of mankind. Peter Harness, writer for the upcoming episode of “Kill the Moon”, has hinted that the episode will see a large change to the show. (This fits perfectly for a Doctor Who season that’s trying to seem “darker”) In DWM: #478, Harness says, ""I still don’t know how people will take it. I’m in this kind of limbo now waiting for people to see it, and I’ve no idea, really I do not know how it is going to go down.""


   If you’ve got a severe case of Arachnophobia, sorry. Apparently, this episode is going to be 45-minutes of Spider hell – featuring many jumpscares at the most opportune times paired with eerie, nerve-wracking music provided by Murray Gold.  Scary fun.  But after all that fun is done, I have a feeling Moffat+Harness are going to make us feel some type of remorse for the spider-creatures. Although I’m not certain, I get the feeling that the Doctor is going to find out that the spider-creatures are somehow lovable, innocent cretins that were put in unfortunate circumstances. (thus were forced to kill?) And the Doctor, being the doctor who’s built a lifetime full of mistakes and is constantly trying to make amends for the wrongs of his past, is going to feel compelled to save both species – human and eight-legged freaks. (Possibly at the sacrifice of some innocent people?) Either that, or these spiders are truly evil and will just be used like plot tools. 

   


   For those of you who’ve seen the Next Time trailer for Kill the Moon, we can see a familiar-looking face that is rumored to be an older Courtney Woods. What better scapegoat to play the part of an innocent life than the former pupil of Ms. Oswald? I can’t think of a darker, twisted, sick ending than having Ms. Oswald use her pupil as a sacrificial lamb for the continuation of humanity.  Add some dramatic music, some epic, minute-countdown flashing red on a panel, some explosions, and this may be a concoction for one of the most memorable moments of Season 8. And too make it icing on the cake, when Clara needs his comfort the most, the Doctor will just be his callous self as he overlooks the entire scene before him; like a General’s indifference when he commands a soldier to kill. 

   Then again.. I hope I’m severely wrong and this ends differently. I would rather enjoy the idea of a 58 yr old Robin Hood and his band of merry peeps (Ozzie, Rupert, and Woods) traveling the galaxy and going on all sorts of adventures.  Can’t have that if Courtney dies, three is an odd number for a squad. /pun

**Things I can’t decide on:**

- Intentional use of space-suits from the Impossible Planet? Or just rehashed clothing because of budget-cuts. Can’t decide.. 

- Giant, radioactive spiders? Or some offspring of Rachnoss?  Can’t decide..

- Will we see Missy again? Can’t decide..  (I’ve got a REALLY good theory about her I’m pretty sure no one   mentioned yet.)

- Predictable, cheesy jumpscares? Or are we in for one of the scariest episodes in Doctor Who history? We’ll decide Saturday night.. ;)       

**Anyways what do you guys think will happen? How do you guys feel about this darker Dr. Who? Would really love to hear some different ideas from everyone! :D**

***    

**Tl; dr :**
This is the same doctor that we’ve seen wipe out Pompeii for the sake of humanity. Peter Harness (writer) suggests that this dark episode is going to change how we see the Doctor.  Spiders are going to be hip-hopping all over the place with cheap jumpscares during silent/Murray gold moments. However, there is a possibility that these spiders are not just vicious creatures and somehow we as an audience will be forced to feel sympathy for them and will be forced to save them. Or not, depending on how the writer wants us to feel, they may just be stupid monsters hell bent on destroying earth and it’s up to Doctor + Clara to stop it. 
Which brings us to our next point, Clara will be forced into a heavy decision as Ms. Oswald uses her pupil (adult Courtney Woods) as a sacrificial lamb for the continuation of humanity. Because that is the logical decision according to the doctor and Clara. Also, the doctor will seem very callous toward her if she tries to look for any comfort. 



**Stl; dr:**
The Doctor suffers from PTSD. Spiders are misunderstood creatures.  Clara kills Courtney.

Just had a quick thought of what is to come on the upcoming episode, “Kill The Moon”.. 

Wanted to see what everyone else thinks. :) 

**[WARNING - Potential Spoilers below if you haven't seen up to S8Ep6]**

***    



   I’m hoping that this episode will somehow end like the “Fires of Pompeii’s” conclusion. The same way that Donna became cognizant of how arduous the 10th doctor’s decisions are – like choosing entire civilizations vs the assurance of a single, yet-innocent life, Clara will also be forced to understand how challenging it is to be the Doctor. Clara will be put through similar trials which will lead her to choose saving an innocent life vs the future of mankind. 

   If you’ve got a severe case of Arachnophobia, sorry. Apparently, this episode is going to be 45-minutes of Spider hell – featuring many jumpscares at the most opportune times paired with eerie, nerve-wracking music provided by Murray Gold.  Scary fun.  But after all that fun is done, I have a feeling Moffat+Harness are going to make us feel some type of remorse for the spider-creatures. 


Although I’m not certain, I get the feeling that the Doctor is going to find out that the spider-creatures are somehow lovable, innocent cretins that were put in unfortunate circumstances. (thus were forced to kill?) And the Doctor, being the doctor who’s built a lifetime full of mistakes and is constantly trying to make amends for the wrongs of his past, is going to feel compelled to save both species – human and eight-legged freaks. (Possibly at the sacrifice of some innocent people) 
Either that, or these spiders are truly evil and will just be used like plot tools. 

   


   For those of you who’ve seen the Next Time trailer for Kill the Moon, we can see a familiar-looking face that is rumored to be an older Courtney Woods. What better scapegoat to play the part of an innocent life than the former pupil of Ms. Oswald?

I can’t think of a darker, twisted, sick ending than having Ms. Oswald use her pupil as a sacrificial lamb for the continuation of humanity.  Add some dramatic music, some epic, minute-countdown flashing red on a panel, some explosions, and this may be a concoction for one of the most memorable moments of Season 8. And too make it icing on the cake, when Clara needs his comfort the most, the Doctor will just be his callous self as he overlooks the entire scene before him; like a General’s indifference when he commands a soldier to kill. 

    


   Then again.. I hope I’m severely wrong and this ends happily. That way, I can go on fantasizing of the idea of a 58 yr old Robin Hood and his band of merry peeps (Ozzie, Rupert, and Woods) traveling the galaxy and going on all sorts of adventures similar to the 1st doctor's crew. But we can’t have that if Courtney dies, three is an odd number for a squad. /pun

**Things I can’t decide on:**

- Intentional use of space-suits from the Impossible Planet? Or just rehashed clothing because of budget-cuts. Can’t decide.. 


- Giant, radioactive spiders? Or some offspring of Rachnoss?  Can’t decide..


- Will we see Missy again? Can’t decide..  (I’ve got a REALLY good theory about her I’m pretty sure no one   mentioned yet.)


- Predictable, cheesy jumpscares? Or are we in for one of the scariest episodes in Doctor Who history? We’ll decide Saturday night.. ;)       
        





**Anyways what do you guys think will happen? How do you guys feel about this darker Dr. Who? Anyone has their own predictions? Would really love to hear some different ideas from everyone! :D**
       



**Tl; dr :**
This is the same doctor that we’ve seen wipe out Pompeii for the sake of humanity. Peter Harness (writer) suggests that this dark episode is going to change how we see the Doctor.  Spiders are going to be hip-hopping all over the place with cheap jumpscares during silent/Murray gold moments. However, there is a possibility that these spiders are not just vicious creatures and somehow we as an audience will be forced to feel sympathy for them and will be forced to save them. Or not, depending on how the writer wants us to feel, they may just be stupid monsters hell bent on destroying earth and it’s up to Doctor + Clara to stop it. 
Which brings us to our next point, Clara will be forced into a heavy decision as Ms. Oswald uses her pupil (adult Courtney Woods) as a sacrificial lamb for the continuation of humanity. Because that is the logical decision according to the doctor and Clara. Also, the doctor will seem very callous toward her if she tries to look for any comfort. 



**Stl; dr:**
The Doctor suffers from PTSD. Spiders are misunderstood creatures.  Clara kills Courtney.

On October 30 (Thursday) I'm catching a flight to Amsterdam which leaves at 6:05 PM. From the Liverpool central i'm taking the 80A bus to the airport. Does anyone know how much the bus costs and how reliable it is? (The bus system where i'm from is incredibly unreliable) 

Lastly, how early should I arrive to the airport? I do have a class that ends at 3 PM, but I plan on leaving class early. I would arrive at the airport at 4:20. Is that enough time for a 6:05 flight? I've already checked in and will not have any hold luggage.

Bad idea.

Jazz is shit; blues is miserable; I hate playlists; I know fuckall about music that isn't a million years old. But 'jazz and blues' is so vague nowadays that I thought I'd take the opportunity to indulge meself. So here it is.

If you're daft enough to try listening to the whole lot together, here's the [YouTube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLi_i_d9AwVVhzhilHnQy0ZH6mRpgCTypa&amp;action_edit=1).

***Jazz mags***

* [Django Reinhardt, J'attendrai Swing](http://youtu.be/T5jtcxtMzAE). Could be pretty much anything by Quintette du Hot Club de France really.    
* [Louis Armstrong, Black and Blue](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LDPUfbXRLM).    
* [Leadbelly, Rock Island Line](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lCiJ4QQG9WQ).  
* [Louis Armstrong again, Mack The Knife](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnOWikgTG2Q). Deliciously stabby Brecht &amp; Weill number.    
* [Cab Calloway, Reefer Man](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svoSSdsNhtA).    
* [Tom Cat, Is You Is Or Is You Ain't My Baby?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5LFD9VDq88) With bonus faceiron!  

***Lady bits***

* [Ella Fitzgerald, My Funny Valentine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KqjKOalcI10).    
* [Billie Holiday, Strange Fruit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Web007rzSOI).   
* [Roberta Flack, The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id_UYLPSn6U). Who would've thought this was written by working class firebrand and champion of British folk music, Ewan MacColl?    
* [Nina Simone, I Put A Spell On You](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDprYZ-tgiA).   
* [Janis Joplin, Summertime](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bn5TNqjuHiU). Live version of the Gershwins' classic.  

***Overpaid, over sexed, and over 'ere***

* [Glenn Miller Orchestra, Pennsylvania 6-5000](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_muFwwTSMs).    
* [Benny Goodman, Clarinetitis](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rl8jXhh3Khg&amp;list=AL94UKMTqg-9C_98EJjKobIUEOTgSEmQko).    
* [The Ink Spots, Whispering Grass](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBrwaCjJIFU).   
* [The Andrews Sisters, Boogie Woogie Bugle Boy From Company B](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qafnJ6mRbgk).    

***Nice!***

* [Unguided Lights, Deep Blue 'C'](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BKJleUGMBUo&amp;noredirect=1). Turn yer subs up to eleven. Not actually jazz or blues, deal with it.    
* [Dave Brubeck Quartet, Take Five](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmDDOFXSgAs). Scored in 5/4 time. Which is a brainfuck.    
* [Miles Davis, adagio from *Concierto de Aranjuez*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvcU_v8ruGE) by Joaquin Rodrígo, from *Sketches Of Spain*, arr. Gil Evans.    
* [Simon &amp; Garfunkel, Anji](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DboCBmjuBxg). Their take on the classic and bastard difficult Bert Jansch choon.    
* [Janet &amp; Jak Eksim, Ija Mia Mi Kerida](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO2iEZYUD9I).    

***Crawdaddy***

* [The Rolling Stones, Little Red Rooster](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nw64KvJXiPk).  
* [Clarence 'Frogman' Henry, Ain't Got A Home](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97IBY8cQ5fs).  
* [The Yardbirds, Good Morning Little Schoolgirl](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIB9HIJH0Uc). I think we can agree that's the most tasteful song title here.    
* [Little Richard, Lucille](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u0Ujb6lJ_mM).  
* [The Doors, Crawling King Snake](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5cwmZxW0Jc). Very dirty version of an arrangement by ...    
* [John Lee Hooker, One Bourbon One Scotch One Beer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-fSZRYeBWk). This should be The Red Lion anthem!

And sure enough, if Roberto Soldado starts, I’m bound to view price comparisons, goal record statistics and general grumblings of discontent. This is just a selection of last summer’s signings; I won’t divulge into the abuse that Aaron Lennon and Andros Townsend can likely be subjected to.


I’ve come to expect Vlad Chiriches being unreliable. He’s always shown a casual style of play and looked uneasy under pressure. It comes as no surprise to see Paulinho anonymous for large swathes of the game, crowded out by opposition players and ineffective at moving the ball anywhere remotely dangerously attacking.

I've attached a menu which is available to large parties on Sundays to give you an idea of what food we offer.
Please do let me know if you would like me to pencil something in.

[Here is a link to the menu from which to choose what food you'd like.] (https://www.dropbox.com/s/fwetbnx3ueouf5t/Sunday%20Lunch%20Large%20Party%20October%20%26%20November%202014.docx?dl=0)

This is a partner friendly event, so if your SO wants to come along even if they aren't going to partake in cigars they're very welcome.

**To book your places and pay your deposits, please send me a PM and I will give you an email address to pay your £10 (per person) deposit to via paypal.** You do not need to give me your real name or any personal details, but **please tell me your menu choices** as I will have to give the Riverbank this info ahead of the day. 

**All deposits and food choice must be in before the 21st of November.**


*Event Info:*

Venue: [The Riverbank Bar &amp; Kitchen,] (http://www.riverbanknotts.co.uk/index-z.shtml) West Bridgeford, Nottingham

We have been called out for being unable to create a ""special atmosphere"" so far this season, and especially in the Champions league. Honestly I don't quite get it. We have such a fantastic manager, amazing players and kick ass stadium. 

I recently took part in a stadium tour, which honestly blew me away. As a fan I recommend every supporter to do so. Which was just £18 for me and my mate: http://travelbird.co.uk/manchester-city-stadium-manchester/

After the tour I realised that this club, with all its ambition, is a great club to be a part of. It surprises me that we feel the need to ask for even more when we should actually consider ourselves very lucky. We are in risk of losing our identity with all the financial backing. Basically what I am trying to say is that as a club, Manchester City is legendary with or without all the cash. Let's not give Man U something to talk about and lets not lose our identity. Perhaps the FFP restrictions will do us some good. Let's show our support for the team. 

The future is sky blue!

Apparently the deal is to purchase 2 seats at 150 each, use the card to swipe in, and the reference code to find our seats. Does this sound legit?

I know most tickets are for season holders, and I don't really know how the system works. If it seems dodgy, does anyone have a pair of tickets available? Willing to spend up to 200 pounds each. Can anyone give me advice?

First off, thank you to any lawyers or legal professionals/students who help me out with this, I am very grateful.

My mum is extremely naïve and easily lead. She met a man online and got talking and this eventually led her to believing that this man was involved with her.

One evening he convinced her that it would be great to go on a £2,000 holiday with him to Senegal. He booked it using her card promising to pay 2/3rds of it back once he had some extra cash (he pulled the story that he had just come back from charity work abroad and was starting from the ground up).

The holiday comes round, and on the flight he reveals to her he is a con man. He had played her into buying him a ticket (and holiday) to Senegal, he wasn't interested in her, and he would not be paying her back.

She stayed a couple of nights in her own room and flew back to the UK on the next available flight.

This man has previously been convicted for harassment of woman (3 woman, 9 counts) and conning. I have found evidence of this online but not sharing it as it identifies him personally.

Before we get started, I know my mum is an idiot. I warned her on multiple accounts that he sounded beyond fishy and that paying for a holiday what essentially is a stranger in my eyes is never a good idea. My mum knows she is an idiot as well so we can skip the bashing.

Does she have any legal grounding to sue this man for what he did. I know in essence everything that he did would appear to be with her consent, but is there any way that it can be shown she was misled and misguided.

Thank you to everyone who takes the time to read this.

First off, thank you to any lawyers or legal professionals/students who help me out with this, I am very grateful.

My mum is extremely naïve and easily lead. She met a man online and got talking and this eventually led her to believing that this man was involved with her.

One evening he convinced her that it would be great to go on a £2,000 holiday with him to Senegal. He booked it using her card promising to pay 2/3rds of it back once he had some extra cash (he pulled the story that he had just come back from charity work abroad and was starting from the ground up).

The holiday comes round, and on the flight he reveals to her he is a con man. He had played her into buying him a ticket (and holiday) to Senegal, he wasn't interested in her, and he would not be paying her back.

She stayed a couple of nights in her own room and flew back to the UK on the next available flight.

This man has previously been convicted for harassment of woman (3 woman, 9 counts) and conning. I have found evidence of this online but not sharing it as it identifies him personally.

Before we get started, I know my mum is an idiot. I warned her on multiple accounts that he sounded beyond fishy and that paying for a holiday what essentially is a stranger in my eyes is never a good idea. My mum knows she is an idiot as well so we can skip the bashing.

Does she have any legal grounding to sue this man for what he did. I know in essence everything that he did would appear to be with her consent, but is there any way that it can be shown she was misled and misguided.

One of the more subtle themes this season has being the idea of the Doctor knowing but not saying for example when Danny enters the Tardis with the apple watch on or when the mutant woman asks the Doctor about this ""way out"" in time heist. It's not constantly in your face but it is there. Keep this in mind for now. 

Many people have however noticed a rather drastic change in the Doctors personality after his regeneration I am of course referring to how the Doctor seems rather unbothered by the apparent deaths of those around him. This goes against the character that both show runners have being trying to establish since the shows revival. With this in mind I have come to a conclusion.


**Y'know all those people who died.. I don't think they did**

The Nethersphere has being described as ""the afterlife"" and even ""heaven"" but because of the similarities between the way the Doctor rescued journey and the way that the solider who seemingly sacrificed herself in the Dalek found herself in Missy's presence I have had a gut feeling (Along with a few other people who made this point in this sub) that she didn't actually die. But was rescued. This idea was reinforced in the caretaker when we notice how the camera lingers of the dummy's in the same room as that robot thingy and then later on see the charred remains of what appears to be a arm or perhaps a *plastic* arm? Otherwise why would the camera have lingered on the dummies for so long?

I believe **the doctor knows** these people aren't really being killed but being teleported (or something else to that effect) but he doesn't know where nor whom to.. Hence the **long winding calculations** he's being working on this series. Many have proposed it's something to do with bringing gallifrey back but I don't think it is. One the points that I believe backs up the idea that he knows is not only his indifference to the ""deaths"" of those around him but his reaction when his two henchmen returned after seemingly died in the time heist the reason for this is that he would have being expecting the ""way out"" to send them the same way all those collected by missy have gone not knowing he had set it up himself meaning missy was not involved that time.

Like many other people in this sub I predict that Clara will ""die"" towards the end of the season and then the doctor will work out the calculation and fix everything. Returning all those who died home in a RTD esque way.

I've looked at some houseshare/room rental sites, but so far only have one confirmed viewing for next weekend.

Do you know anybody who has a room to rent for 3 months (1st Nov - 2nd Feb ish) that I could get in touch with?

Q1) We've both had a lukewarm start to the season, where do you see both sides finishing in the league this year?

Q2) Are there any current Manchester United Players that you particularly like and dislike?

Q3) After the debacle last season with Moyes at United and the 7th place finish, would you be confident that VanGaal is the right man for us?

.

Q4) What are your feelings this season on Martinez? Despite a great first season for you he his coming under increasing criticism on both results and performance. Do you still have confidence that he is the right man at Goodison.

.

Q5) What are your thoughts on the proposed stadium move to Walton Hall Park and also the approval of that lot over the park extending their capacity.

I am a student and rented a house with five other girls last year. Halfway through the year, I had to suspend university due to illness. 

As I was no longer an enrolled student I became liable to pay council tax. After a series of exchanges with the council, it was agreed that I did not have to pay and would be granted an exemption as I had moved out of the property back home and had not entered the year long contract with the intention of becoming ill midway through the year. 

Around the time I was first billed, my landlord also began receiving bills for council tax for the property that we were renting and other houses that he rents out. These bills were in his name and had a different account number to my own. 

The rest of the girls moved out at the end of the academic year but he did not return our deposit. We have had several phone call exchanges over the summer holidays during which he has said that he cannot return the deposit whilst he has a council tax bill on the house. I have told him numerous times that everything is sorted on my end and that as the bills are in his name so he has to go to the council just as I did to sort them out. Whilst he has not explicitly stated it, he infers that it is my fault that he is being billed for this house and the others. 

The latest in this saga is him asking for copies of my personal documents that state that I am exempt. I feel very uncomfortable giving him documents that contain my personal details, mostly because the group of us did not have fantastic dealings with him as our landlord. I have spoken to the council about this and they have said that he doesn't need those documents, he just needs to prove the house was being rented at the time. 

So my question is does he have any basis in asking for these documents? It has now been four months since we moved out and our deposit hasn't been returned so is he able to withhold it based on this?

Many thanks in advance!",false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,null,null,self,Is my landlord entitled to a copy of my personal documents?,12,http://www.reddit.com/r/AskUK/comments/2i7mpb/is_my_landlord_entitled_to_a_copy_of_my_personal/

Next meet up is gonna be at the [Tram Depot](https://sites.google.com/site/tramdepotcambs/) on **Saturday 11th October!**


I'll be there from **7pm** with a couple of card games and probably some sweets as usual. If enough people respond on here and on the FB group then I'll ring up about booking a table.


I kinda wanna use this get-together as a chance to talk about plans for Halloween! I guess we'll probably be due another pub meet by then, but if we wanted to do a Halloween punting ghost tour again like last year as well then or something else I could look at getting it booked.

**FORM GUIDE**

**Leeds United** - WDWWLD  
**Sheffield Wednesday** - DWWLLD

------------------------------

**Sgt_General's Predicted XI**

                   Silvestri    

       Byram   Bellusci   Pearce   Cooper

                    Bianchi    

          Cook                 Mowatt    

                     Sloth    

              Sharp         Doukara

We seem to be starting to get a feel for the players Milanic is trusting to get a result in each game now, but Milanic's Leeds United is still very much a work in progress and I don't think that we'll see a settled side quite yet. Granted, it hasn't helped that we've had three games in the space of a week, which has made a certain amount of rotation necessary, but I still feel that the new head coach is trying to determine who the best players are in certain positions. We can already see a certain amount of this in midfield, with Sloth taking Austin's place on Wednesday and - according to reports - Bianchi taking up a more defensive role with Cook moving to the right. I expect this to continue and would honestly be surprised if any of the midfielders changed. This game is set to be too physical for Adryan to start, although I expect him to make his debut from the bench, with Austin being the only change I could see happening because of his physical presence. Nevertheless, I can see Sloth maintaining his place for both his technical ability and capability of finding holes in defence.

One change that took me by surprise on Saturday was Cooper being selected ahead of Warnock, who has had an outstanding season so far. One of Milanic's reasons was because he thought Cooper would offer more stability in defence against the threat of Reading's Blackman. Now I don't know about you guys, but I think that if I were head coach and concerned about the other team's winger, I'd use the former England international who naturally plays in that position. If Cooper started against Reading then I can see him starting against Wednesday, where he will actually be useful in combating their height advantage of the pitch. However, I still hope that Warnock was merely being rested or - if rumours of Cellino's meddling are true - things have been patched up between him and the president.

Finally, I can see Sharp starting in this game. We've gone through two games without scoring a goal now, which means that something has to change, and Sharp being the only one to actually hit the target on Wednesday should stand him in good stead. I think that it will be Antenucci to make way, because Sharp and Antenucci together are a bit lightweight up front - at this point I would consider Doukara to be a definite starter due to his physical presence, technical ability, and the fact that he's our top scorer. So I think that Sharp and Doukara are worth a go up front, especially with the way Milanic has been openly talking about Sharp making his way back into the reckoning in the build-up to Saturday.

**Sgt_General's Prediction**

1-0 to Leeds

Well... it doesn't hurt to be optimistic! It's still early days under Darko Milanic, but I have to be honest and say that from my point of view there haven't been a lot of positives. We reportedly looked more compact and composed in defence on Wednesday, which is good, but Reading still had the lion's share of chances and we've more lucky not to concede more goals over the past seven days (we have a certain Mr. Silvestri to thank for that!). However, even more worrying is that our threat in front of goal seems to have dried up of late. Yet, in spite of all this negativity, I just can't help but think that this game will see things click for us. I think that we'll build on the work Milanic has been doing with the defence, but finally add a sharp edge (pun intended!) to our attack this time around. Especially if Adryan can come on and help unlock a very strong Wednesday defence. Either way, I'm excited to finally get a glimpse of Milanic's Leeds United!

I thought I'd be dead clever, having forgotten around 10 gigs of data from my iTunes library, or what I thought was around 10 gigs of data. This was backed up to my home server/NAS.

Looking into things, the best thing I could have done was used a piece of software called Unison, however hindsight dictates that this was a dumb idea. It seems to have absolutely hammered my connection, both in up and download...something unbeknownst to me until I got a scary e-mail today about having used around half of my data already.

There was me, and a mate, a commited socialist, at a pub. A couple of pints inside, and the discussion invariably turned to politics - and his contention that the Yes Movement should be about protecting jobs.

Maybe it’s just my Nordic background, but in my view strong trade unions should be merciless in shutting down operations like Poundland and low-wage exploitative work-places. If an outfit like Poundland would try to get into Sweden, you’d have every conceivable union blockading it.

Poundland would struggle to get garbage collected because while the Municipal worker’s union might not be directly affected, the ideal of union solidatiry exist, and you’d have sympathy blockades. 

Why, you might ask, when youth unemployment in Sweden is so high, would unions do this? Well, it’s actually in their self-interest to do so. This kind of company does require capital and labour, who otherwise would be withheld from more suitable operations. With money being a finite resource, the banks and creditors would lend to Poundland - and not have money over for better jobs and better companies.

I tried to explain this to my mate, but I’m not sure I got through. What I wanted to say was that maybe accepting low-wage jobs are not in anyone’s interest. Not even those who would benefit from the low wage. If money were spent on good education and good training programs instead, that would be better than to accept Poundland-jobs.

What do you think?

So i apologize if this comes off negatively.

One thing that has bothered me about the show RIGHT after Tennant left was that they seemed to really stop keeping up with the shows canon in some ways, and what i mean by that is Eccleston To Tennant seemed to be in much more of the same ""universe"" than Smith and so far Capaldi. The 9th Doctor and Rose had such an amazing chemistry together and that chemistry spilled over to the 10th doctor and even when Rose leaves the show there is constant reminders of how much the doctor missed her, often mentioning her to Martha and Donna and this is reaffirmed that after all is said and done the last thing the 10th doctor wanted to do before he went was to visit Rose to see her one last time. Tennant makes a few nods to eccelston a few times (the ""are you my mummy"" was my favorite). Martha comes back with Mickey in the Donna seasons, cassandra was a recurring character and all in all it just made you believe that nothing was lost from the 9th doctor to the 10th doctor.

What is hard for me believe is that how Matt Smith (and so far Capaldi) can go so long without mentioning Rose, Martha, Donna, heck even wilfred or mickey or any other characters that were so present in the doctors lives for so long. I mean, not even a mention or a nod or anything. The writers did such a good job making all of those characters so important to the doctor, especially rose tyler, and ever since Smiths portrayal we dont get so much of a mention that any of these people were ever a part of his life.

Look, i get that they cant have Billie Piper come back every season and that its an ever evolving show with new cast and characters, i would argue though that throwing a little bone every now and again wouldnt be so bad. It was shocking that Smiths doctor could go so long without visiting or mentioning any of these people. Its taken me a little out of the universe when the writers seem to completely not care about anything pre-Smith in the shows Canon. I would hate for them to constantly be revisiting old enemys or followers and think it would grow stale quickly if they did that, but think also, on the opposite side of the spectrum, that its hurt the flow of the show a bit by not doing it AT ALL.

Does anyone know why that is? I love the show but dont really follow things ""behind the scenes"" if you will, so i apologize if there is an obvious reason for this that i just dont know about. For what its worth, i think capaldi is killing it, i love his portrayal so much.

TL;DR The 9th and 10th doctor seemed way more connected than the 10th and 11th doctor.

I left college in 2010 and I haven't done anything since so I'm used to going to bed early in the morning. My sleeping pattern isn't the best..

Just wondering are these 2 shifts allright for getting to sleep ?

One is 6am - 2pm so this means I'll have to be in bed for 9.00 pm to make sure I get enough sleep to get up at 5.00.

The next shift is 2pm - 10pm so this means I'll be getting to bed at 12am and getting up at 8am.

So one week I'll be getting in bed at 9pm and another I'll be getting in bed at 12am..

Would this be bad for my sleeping pattern ?

Thanks in advance !

Just thought I would post to tell you all how impressed I've been with Southampton. Although I've played Football/Soccer my whole life, I never really got into watching the Premier League, mainly because I wasn't a fan of the fact that only a few teams ever have a real chance of winning the league.

Then I bought Football Manager on a whim, randomed Southampton as my club, and that was that.  I've fallen back in love with the sport. My friends who do watch Premier League Football made fun of me for picking a team that lost so many players, but I'm glad I did. When I woke up at 4:30 in the morning to watch the opening match against Liverpool, I knew I'd made a good choice. I loved the ""What is this, a library?"" chants.

Since my only experience with Southampton is from in-game and the first few matches of this season, is there anything I should know as a new fan? I've been reading loads of articles, but is there some guide somewhere for fan-favorites (Fonte) and villains (Lallana, Lovren)? That's it.

I posted this before the season started and was right on every single one. This is mostly because I'm a free lance journo/lawyer/scout/manager/chairman of LFC but it helps that I'm better at pattern recognition than most. So with that in mind here's few more observations

 I'm a strong believer that last season was so great for us because the season before that we were wank. And it didn't come as a surprise to anyone. We had a new manager invoking his ideas on a team stuck in limbo- half in Rafa's rigid deep defending system, and half with the desire and will to play strong attacking football. It took a while for the team to adapt to Brendan and for Brendan to harness the strengths of the team. It took the whole season to get that formula right. This bore fruit the season after. So... why is this a surprise now? Of course Rodgers doesn't know what his best 11 is, most of the new squad can't even fully grasp what Rodgers wants from them. Of course our defense is an embarrassment, 3/4 of it have never played in this club before. It doesn't matter how ""similar"" the playing styles of the players were at their previous clubs were, this kind of work takes time and patience. Its not just about ""gelling"" in either. Even teams who've more or less had the same squad for a few years can go through a transition season (ie Chelsea last season). Its a mental thing for the players. Last season Coutinho and Studge had a connection and Suarez and Sterling had a connection. This was telepathic. It was instant. This gave our attack flow and a sharpness to it. This season the only sort of pair we have is Lallana and Balotelli. This won't be fixed by time but will be fixed when we figure out the right combination of players. 

I'm posting this because as far as I've read here and r/soccer and a few other soccer sites, people don't seem to understand how transition seasons work. Basically, you have ups and downs this season so you can work out problems and then go fighting this season. This happens to most teams. Let me give you a good recent example: BvB finished 6th under Klopp's first season. Won the BuLi by a country mile the season after. Were knocked out of the UCL group stages in a relatively straightforward group. Next season won their group (consisting of Real Madrid, City and Ajax) and went onto the finals. Look at Mourinho's return to the Bridge. Last season was a transition for them, yes they could beat the big boys but had an awful record against the smaller teams, and low-and-behold they are now practically shoe in for the title because that season gave them a chance to access the situation and fix the team. This is how you succeed when in transition. You fail in one season but you iron everything out for the next.

Too many times I've seen us waste away because people couldn't understand how transition seasons work and put in unnecessary pressure on the team and the manager. If Rodgers gets sacked at the end of the season or mid season because of pressure then we'd have truly pulled a Spurs, a team that is constantly stuck in transition seasons because its so trigger happy. You don't have to be happy about this. You don't have to like Rodger's tactics or our players lack of understanding of said tactics. But you have to support the team and the vision that is set for the team. Trust in the long term. A few eggs must be cracked to make that delicious omelet.

Sorry about the wall of texts but I feel that a much broader view must be taken into account of our season so far.  Everything has been either too isolated and we've been madly looking for a reason to blame something or someone.

Me and my partner have finally got our heads in the right places and decided to once and for all sort our financial shit out. We've come up with a plan of action that I'd love to run by you lot to pick apart or advise on something we are most likely missing.

* We have a total £10k debt
* Credit Card #1 - £1700
* Credit Card #2 - £1900
* The remaining is family debt (no interest)
* We have £1000 readily available (days) in a credit union savings (I'm really not seeing the point in CU for me anymore).
* We have between £300 - £400 expendable cash every month (that has been 'disappearing' for far too many years it's sickening).
* I'm presuming their is no point in saving yet?

**The Plan**

* Smash credit card #1 - with £1000 CU and 2 months expendable cash.
* Start credit card #2 - £300/month - Gone in &lt;= 6months.
* Family debt - £3k, £1.5k, £1k (to different family members) - which we want to pay to each in full (eg hang onto it until we get £3k for family member #1 and pay in one big drop).

There is zero pressure and zero interest on the family debt so this should (obviously?) be last, all's cool with that...but...

...are we approaching the credit cards right? or should we pay the cards simultanously (eg: £175 off each one, each month?).

and because we are paying each family member in full we will be 'saving' that money for many months, is there anything we can do with that to help with that (eg: savings interest?)

**Edit: Extra question.**

My concern with putting all of our expendable cash with no savings, when ""one of those months"" raises it's head (usually once per year in our life) where something expected rears it's head would you advise keeping one of the cards open so that money is available should an emergency occur (that's kind of what the CU is for - £1000 would get us out of most problems)?

Thank you in advance for your help.

My opinion? Lacking flair up front but everything else looks solid. Silvestry hasn't been tested and the defense look confident as does the midfield. Pls based Adryan.

Am I due a tax rebate? If so, how much? - roughly? I am sorry for the basic information. If there not enough information to estimate, then please tell me what else I will need to calculate this?

My understanding is that from April 2014 - 30th June 2014, I did not earn enough to reach my personal allowance. Therefore, anything taxed should be rebated back? Is the same reasoning applicable from July 2013 - March 2014? Was i Tax'd too much as I started in July, not April? :S

##Commentary
Minute | | Description
:--------:|------------|----|
0 | | WBA get the game started
4 | | LFC have made a good start here. Coutinho and Lallana both trying to provide balls into the box for Lambert
6 | | Corner to LFC. Both sides fumble inside the box but it is eventually cleared
7 | | Henderson fouled on the edge of the penalty box
8 | | Gerrards FK straight at the wall. Corner
9 | | Corner is cleared by WBA
10 | | Another corner to Liverpool as Sterling pressurizes Lescott. It was taken quick and now WBA have a GK
11 | |Corner to WBA conceded by Gerrard. Mignolet punches the ball away.

I've lost touch with others and don't really feel like I can ask someone I used to know to meet up as it would just be weird trying to explain why I lost touch.

Right now I just work then come home and watch tv shows and sleep too much, far far too much. Can't really force myself to go outside as I have nothing to do, no where to go. Thinking its possible someone else might be the same. It would be nice to have a reason to leave the house, normally if I make an arrangement with someone I keep it so I would have to come out and get a Coffee, or Hot Chocolate more likely for me:)

Age and Gender does not matter. I cannot guarantee a lively chat as I am pretty boring in all fairness, but I am open and friendly.

Thank you :)

Edit:   I would say to any others who may consider I really don't mind saying hi to anyone who is interested in saying hello back. Its not so much about meeting others dealing with the same issues it really is just trying to find an excuse to make myself leave the house. I only aimed the message towards others feeling the same way as they too may need an excuse to get some fresh air :)

**Match Score:**  
Aston Villa  **0**  
Manchester City **2**


___
**Match Events:**  
**1'** Villa Park is looking sunny and Manchester City get us underway, shooting towards the Holte.    
**2'** Weimann looking lively finding some space just outside the box, but loses the ball under his feet as he lines up to shoot, Manchester City clear  
**3'** First glimpse of Yaya at full flight, Senderos closes the door and clears    
**4'** Milner finds himself in space down the Man City left, his low cross is dangerous and eventually cleared by Baker.  
**10'** Koloravs shot hits the outside of the post after Senderos blocks Agueros oriringal shot.  
**12'** Delph and Cleverley combined to create space for Cleverley around 25 yards out, as he winds up to shoot Silva gets in and pokes the ball away.  
**15'** City looking dangerous just outside the Villa Box, is ended by a wayward pass by Yaya out for goalkick  
**20'** Villa exposed by a poor pass from Cissokho, Dzeko races towards goal before a great tackle by Baker ends the attack.  
**21'** Weimann almost puts Villa ahead, N'Zogbia cuts inside onto his left foot and puts a delightful cross in between the two centre backs, he's stretching and just can't get enough contact to score  
**22'** City go straight up the other end, Silva plays Aguero in but can't beat Guzan in a foot race and the keeper gathers.  
**23'** [](#icon-yellow-card)Kolarov, Hutton sets off on a run and is taken down by Kolarov who earns the games first yellow card.    
**24'** N'Zogbia robs Fernandinho for the ball on the half way line and races towards goal. He unleashes a shot from 25 yards, Hart is at full stretch but it's always curling wide.    
**28'** Kolarov with a fantastic wiped cross into the box, Aguero gets his head to it putting it not far wide of the back post.  
**30'** Hutton looks to aim for Weimann with a cross from deep, he gets it all wrong and lands on the roof of the net.  
**33'** Villa lose concentration and are beaten by a short corner, baker clears but only to Fernandinho who finds Dzeko. He should score but looks to fire it into the roof of the net and it goes high into the Holte.  
**36'** Kolarov lines up a free kick from 30 yards out, Guzan is at full stretch and its not far from finding the bottom corner, Villa goalkick.    
**37'** Delph forces Kompany into a mistake and Weimann is through on goal. For the second time today he fails to get the ball out of his feet properly and the chance is wasted.  
**40'** Dzeko again finds himself free in box, he takes too much time and Villa crowd him out, the ball goes out for a City corner.  
**43'** Baker has been a one man brick well so far this half, Aguero makes space in the box as he waits for the ball to drop, Baker intercepts and clears.  
**44'** Nice footwork from Dzeko, allows Milner to drift into space his left footed shot is deflected on the side netting
**45'** From the corner Milner hits it low to Kolarov, Cleverley deflects it out for a third corner.  
**45'** **[](#icon-info)  1 Minute of Added Time**  
**45+1'** Cissokho this time with the block! The header from the corner looked destined to be the opening goal of the game, until Cissokho sticks his foot out to clear.  
**45+1'** [](#icon-timeclock) **Half Time: Aston Villa 0 Manchester City 0**    
**46'** Villa get the second half underway.    
**46'** Milner slips Augero through and his side footed shot hits the post!  
**47'** Villa go straight up the other end with N'Zogbia who plays Richardson through he dwells on the ball far too long and Zabaleta gets back to make the tackle.  
**48'** Silva with a lovely turn in the box forces Guzan into a good save    
**49'** Delph drifts through the city midfield but doesn't hit his shot cleanly, it takes a deflection of Fernandinho but a goalkick is given.  
**52'** N'Zogbia with a driving run from his own half, should release it to Weimann but continues to drive for goal, before Kompany puts in the block.  
**55'** Fernandinho [](#icon-subout-arrow) goes off injured for [](#icon-subin-arrow) Lampard   
**58'** Villa park is rocking  
**59'** N'Zogbia &amp; Cleverley play the ball between them Cleverley cross and finds Weimann who heads wide.  
**60.** Weimann [](#icon-subout-arrow) makes way for [](#icon-subin-arrow) Benteke!  
**61'** Benteke with an immediate impact, takes the ball down on the half way line and exchanges passes with Delph ends up free on the byline, Kompany cuts out the ball across the box.  
**63'** Cissokho needlessly gives away a free kick on the edge of the area, Silva hit is just over the bar.  
**64'** Dzeko [](#icon-subout-arrow) is off for [](#icon-subin-arrow) Fernando  
**67'** Silva wiggles his way through some defenders, his shot is weak and easy for Guzan to collect  
**69'** Quick flick around the corner by Silva to Milner, Milner returns the ball to Silva who at full stretch has Guzan beaten but also beats the far post.  
**70'** N'Zogbia [](#icon-subout-arrow) off for [](#icon-subin-arrow) Bacuna and Richardson [](#icon-subout-arrow) makes way for [](#icon-subin-arrow) Grealish  
**71'** Aguero with a quick shot through the legs of Baker, Guzan has everything behind it and saves.  
**72'** Kolarov runs at Bacuna who falls over, his cross is out for a corner. The resulting corner is met by the head of Mangala, Guzan graps it out of the air.  
**79'** Sustained few minutes of City pressure is ended as Guzan collects from a high cross.  
**81'** Baker blocks a shot from Silva, it only goes as far as Lampard who should score but shoots straight at Guzan.   
**82'** [](#icon-football) Yaya drives at the Villa defence and places the ball into the back of the net, little Guzan could do.  
**83'** Silva [](#icon-subout-arrow) makes way for [](#icon-subin-arrow) Navas  
**87'** [](#icon-football) Aguero! You don't stop those, Milner plays in Aguero who makes a yard of space and fires into the back of the net.  
**90'** [](#icon-info) **4 Minutes of Added Time**  
**90+4'** [](#icon-timeclock)**Full Time: Aston Villa 0 Manchester City 2**

**EVENTS:**

*Not much for chances so far either way*

25' - 4 chances, 0 on target. Villa have had 1 chance, 0 on target

28' - Kolarov whips in a cross and Aguero's header is just wide of the far post

34' - Dzeko with good control in the box, but blasts his shot high

37' - Kolarov pulls his shot wide from a free kick

39' - Milner looked onside when played clear through, but the call goes against us

41' - Dzeko brings down the ball in the box, but his shot his blocked

45' - City have had four corners in a row, two were really good chances at the end of the half

---

**Halftime** Wow Sunderland's third goal was beautiful

City Matchday Centre: http://www.mcfc.co.uk/matchday?ref=f755363

---

**Second Half:**

47' - Aguero knocks it off the post from a great throughball from Milner, Villa counter with Richardson, but a great tackle by Zabaleta and a stop by Hart keeps it level

55' - Fernandinho comes off for Lampard

*Substitutions:* Benteke on, Weimann off. Fernando on, Dzeko off

68' - After some sustained pressure Silva tests Guzan, but is gathered up rather easily

70' - Milner pulls it back for Silva whose shot is wide

*Substitutions:* Bacuna on, Richardson off. Grealish on, N'Zogbia off

74' - City looking good lately and Mangala thundering header from a corner is saved by Guzan who has had a much busier second half

75' - Toure's passes have been off and his pass in to Silva is over hit

*At some point in the first half, Kolarov got a yellow*

83' - Toure brought his shooting boots! Beautiful finish on his left to curl past Guzan! **1-0 MANCHESTER CITY!**

*Substituion* Navas on, Silva off

89' - Milner slides it in to Aguero at the top of the box and he finishes it off! **2-0 Manchester City!**",false,MCFC,t5_2s14k,null,null,self,Match Thread: Aston Villa v Manchester City,11,http://www.reddit.com/r/MCFC/comments/2iab63/match_thread_aston_villa_v_manchester_city/

I discovered [Dress For Less](http://dressforlesslondon.com) on St John Street today - primarily it's a second-hand designer clothes shop, but they also have a table overflowing with discounted fancy makeup! I didn't want to stand there taking notes, but here is what I remember seeing. All of it was brand new and nothing I saw was over £30.



* Benefit High Beam Illuminator - £15 (usually £19.50)
* Guerlain
* Lancome
* Laura Mercier
* Stila - eyeshadow monos, lip glaze
* Bobbi Brown -  eyeshadow monos, lip glosses and lipsticks
* MAC - illuminating powder
* Tom Ford- Blush Nude and Negligee lipsticks, also some nail polish
* Suqqu
* Joan Collins - bronzer &amp; lipstick set
* Lipstick Queen
* NARS - some eyeshadow monos &amp; duos, and £11 Larger Than Life lip gloss (usually £19ish)
* Sisley Paris - lip colour
* Chantecaille - one lipstick
* Lime Crime - one glitter thing
* Shu Uemura
* By Terry - lipsticks
* YSL
* Giorgio Armani - lots of this, mostly blusher/bronzer
* Chanel
* Butter London - lots of lipsticks
* Clinique
* Estee Lauder - Double Wear foundation



No haul sadly because I am broke as a joke (though I was sorely tempted by NARS Larger Than Life in Sixties Fan.) The collection is pretty random and unpredictable, but as you can see it's worth a rummage! They also have skincare and perfume.

NB: there are no testers, you can open the products but you can't try them out.

I would have to pay rent, which if I'm on benefits is reduced to barely nothing. But if I'm working any kind of job it goes up massively, I have no idea if I qualify for it to be cut down if I do an apprenticeship and if I will even be able to afford it on the wage.


Secondly, what level apprenticeship I am looking to do as a former A Level student. They are not clearly defined and I have no idea what I am looking for.


I've looked through all the apprenticeship sites looking for answers and advice, but nothing useful or specific has shown up. I even emailed the Careers Advice Service but they just misunderstand my question and referred me to funding to **hire** an apprentice.

So, I really love cars and I've been pining for a new one for ages. I'm just starting out on renting a property with my girlfriend and combined we will probably spend a maximum of 1200 a month meaning if we split the money I have about another 600-800 to save for a mortgage/live/buy my own things.

My car is starting to have some issues due to it being a diesel and driving short distances so its filling up with soot and starting to make the filter get clogged etc even though it's only done 40k miles since 2006. It'd probably be fixable for around £500 or so but I'm also very anal about paintwork/bodywork which is pretty bad since it was crashed into a while back and I had to put a scrapped car door on it and a third party mirror. (adding to the fact my girlfriend hates the car as she feels sick inside it due to the hard ride which the Golf doesn't have)

Now I REALLY want to get a new Golf R which is around 30k and have been looking at lease/pcp etc but I keep thinking I can't afford it and I should save the money for a mortgage instead. I can get the previous model for around 22k but I keep thinking the new one is that much better so not sure which to go for still!

Do you think I should just give in and get the car and take the hit now or should I not bother and put the money towards a mortgage and fix the car for now? It's likely I won't be able to afford my ""dream"" car once I get the mortgage due to trying to over pay it as much as possible.

A month ago. I made 4 line-ups, none of which included Manquillo or Coutinho and I was lambasted. Multiple times I stated in there that I loved Coutinho and just preferred Lallana (because my brother is a Saints fan and I watched around 25 matches last year with him). I also stated I was not sold on Manquillo as a starter and preferred Johnson. Downvoted to all hell. 

So maybe I dont want to brag because form can change I understand but I just want to show how much public perception changes. Manquillo was our worst player tonight (he has been ok though recently) and Coutinho has been woeful this year (He'll find his form).

Thanks you pricks!

I'm currently building a Premier League team and therefore have had a chance to try out some of the cheaper Tottenham players. 

I have played with Lamela, Vorm, Capoue, Stambouli and Kaboul. 

Right now my favorite player is Capoue, this man is everywhere and usually comes out on top in 50/50's. Kaboul has also been a rock. I tried Fernando from Man City, but Capoue was better hands down. 

Lamela has been ehh. Vorm a stud in goal, but I hear Howard is that dude for a Prem team. 

Anyone have any gems? Goaldado any good? Ade just as lazy as real life? Eriksen as poor as the reviews?

The last few months on and off our house phone has been getting phone calls that 1471 says is from the number 000000000000. Yes, just 12 zeroes, so both a digit too long to be a UK phone number, and I'm reasonably certain an invalid phone number everywhere in the world. Most of the time we don't pick up (we don't use the house phone for much, and only give it to close friends - online things that want it I give a burner number), and we have one of those shitty BT phones that have an answer machine on them. However, whether we pick up or not is irrelevant, the call always follows one of these three formats:

1) Just a long continuous beep like the line is dead
2) Silence, bar the typical phone static you get
3) A few seconds of silence, followed by a robotic voice saying ""Goodbye"", THEN the line going dead. 

The problem is that these happen anywhere from 1 to 12 times a day, even as late/early as 3am. It also called my mobile, and this is where I'm starting to get slightly scared that something is going on. I got a new number last week and got a call from it again on the new number a few days ago. At first I thought that BT and Orange are just selling number lists or something, but I got a call from it agian half an hour ago (I didn't answer), and then 20 minutes ago my girlfriend (who's American) sent me this on Skype:

[21:04:43] xxxxxx: Ok question
[21:05:02] xxxxxx: What is a +0000000000 number or w/e

I'm going to be honest this has left me mildly rattled. Does anyone have experience with this number? Is it someone trying to intimidate you into giving money or something? If so that raises the question of how the fuck they've gotten my house number, two mobile numbers, and my foreign girlfriends mobile number.

Ok, one thing that has always kinda confused me, why does the Doctor help humanity out so much. He seems to spend a large amount of time keeping us alive. He and the rest of the time lords also are very human in appearance. They have certain abilities that we dont, but like the regeneration cycles these could be from artificial adaptation and not something which is naturally innate in them. After all we only have the doctor for comparison and he was a soldier in the time wars. This sorta leads me to think that is it possible that the timelords and humanity are linked somehow?

In the episode Utopia, it appears that some of the remains of humanity are sent back in time. This is where my hypothesis comes in. What if the Timelords are the Descendants of humanity, what if some survivors from the end of time, get sent back to an early time in the universe, where they then go through another several billion years of evolution. Time spent around time vortexs... could this be why the doctor spends so much of his life fixing humanity? could he be tweaking the species to ensure the timelords, or the right timelords come out of it?",false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,null,null,self,Timelord Hypothesis,1,http://www.reddit.com/r/doctorwho/comments/2ib63l/timelord_hypothesis/

Thought people may find this helpful considering Sportscene isn't on till Sunday evening so if you weren't at the game or not on TV you got to wait to see it. 

If anyone has any subjection how the thread can be improved/ added or if I'm missing anything give us a shout. Also do you prefer gif with or without Commentary ?

Rodgers is a proud man, and this can be a failing of his. Ultimately, I'm worried that Lovren might be a big problem for us if he doesn't improve significantly because, besides the obvious repercussions that has in itself, he might be (relatively) exempt from being dropped. 

To be clear, I do actually rate many aspects of Lovrens game. I love his aggressive pressing since it seems to fit so well with what Rodgers is trying to instill into the side and Gerrard has been better covering for him when he does this. He has many physical and defensive attributes that mean he has the tools to be a top defender, but christ his headers (even unchallenged) is appalling at times, his decision making is suspect, and he loses his man more times than I'm willing to count. In my opinion, Sakho is the best CB we have at the club but Rodgers doesn't seem to share this sentiment. And I understand why Rodgers is favouring Lovren after only recently spending the money on him and with Lovren looking, on paper, like exactly the type of defender we need. But I worry if these mistakes continue that Rodgers might not make the decision he needs to. That time is nearing imo with every point vital. Thoughts?

Is our new Spanish boy already a better choice than Johnson? 
Let's write some pros: 
Manquillo:
hardworker, better on the positional play, maybe slightly better on one-on-one situation. 
Johnson: 
better attacking skills(dribbling and speed, but they both have shitty crosses really, no near to Moreno's ones), way better chemistry with Sterling(when he's on the right), maybe more effective on defending standart situations. 

I would start Johnson in nearest games simply because I think he clearly understands that this is his one and only chance to show that he deserves to stay in the club. I know Johnson is some kind of Paul fucking Konchesky for many people here, but I think he can be more useful right now, than young and unexperienced Manquillo.

I'm only 22 so I'll name only those one's I have seen during my supporting time: 

GK - Charles Itandje - I choose him because I simply haven't seen him play at all but funny thing is, in my first language(Georgian) his name means ""you must suffer"".

Defenders: 
Djimi God Traore, 
Paul Konchesky(do I have to explain these two?)
Kirgyakos(I don't care if I spelled his name wrong, he himself is the wrongest one), 
Seb Coates(because he showed nothing if not count that magical kick against QPR, but we all know that will never ever happen one more time). 

Midfield:
Christian Poulsen(guy was a joke. I remember Juventus fans having party after LFC brought him). 

Jay Spearing(I know he's our guy but honestly, everyone who played in the midfield area last ten years, were better).

Steward Downing(because we paid 10 times more than his actual price).

Joe Cole(all he did is getting a red card in his debut)

Attack:
One and only El Hadji Diouf(I don't know your oppinion, but for me he is a disgrace to football) 
And everyone's beloved David N'Gog who scores when he wants. 

note: Andy Carroll can't start even in this team because of his injury.

From what I gathered people complain about S8 and Moffat in particular about how he's handling the show. I can understand that sometimes it feels different but I also enjoy the kind of more mature take. ""Listen"" is a perfect example, one of my favourite episodes from all DW so far.

About the Doctor, Capaldi feels more alien but isn't that the point? every Doctor has a different personality and his soul remains the same.

First of all, it's a very anti-knee-jerk type of review, which I think is so important in 1) preserving our sanity as fans, and 2) figuring out if what Rogers is doing is what actually needs to be done, etc.

What he says about Rogers is spot on. Walsh points out how Rogers suredly makes wrong decisions, but he recognizes ""in times of trouble, standing still is not an option. The Northern Irishman highlighted how that will never be his intention at Anfield."" I've followed a lot of teams who are living examples of Einstein's definition of insanity.

Walsh also perfectly sums up the whole positioning of Coutinho, Henderson, Lucas and Gerard (the midfield has absolutely been the root of all our problems this season).

Additionally, Walsh comments on what we all loved to see: Gerrard moving upfield. But its expressed with cautious optimism. 15 minutes isn't a good sample size, but it is certainly something to be excited about.

So yeah, it's just a review by The Echo, but I thought it was one of the better game reviews I've read in a long time. The main point is how well it defines this game as a defining (as in, it really gave us a look at what we actually have (*Lallana*)) game of the year.

Orson said he was descended from a time-traveller - one of his great-grandparents, or grandparents or something. And though we're led to believe this grandparent is Clara, he didn't say what gender that grandparent was.

And though we saw how Clara got a hold of the figurine (from young Rupert/Danny Pink), we never saw how it came to be in HIS possession. And that figurine ultimately ended up in the young Doctor's possession.

So here's my thinking...what if Orson Pink is actually just descended from Danny, but not Clara?

We were led to believe that Orson existing cemented that Clara/Danny would end up together and end up having a family that included Orson, but if you think about it, Clara isn't needed in this equation - Danny himself will clearly be a time-traveller at some point in this series. And Orson only mentioned ONE time-travelling grandparent, not that both grandparents were. So if Danny is THE grandparent, Clara cannot be his other grandparent.

Which leads onto the figurine - how does it end up in young Rupert/Danny's possession when it was last left with the young Doctor, two millenia before, closing the loop?

I reckon we'll see Clara realise all of what I just wrote - or Danny himself, after Clara's future death - and then taking the figurine (still locked up on the TARDIS, as the Doctor's own comfort blanket) back to young Rupert, closing the loop in a bittersweet moment.

I think the writers have been forshadowing this change especially in the episode Waters of Mars, and during the Smith Doctor's ""I'm the scariest mutherfucker in the Universe"" bravado.  

Riffing on this hypothetical theme, I see Capaldi becoming one of the most iconic Doctors ever to ride the TARDIS, even rivaling Tennent.  I'd like to imagine a plot arc that brings back the Master, who after being redeemed by the Tennant Doctor, continues his evolution as a redeemed being by evolving towards good as Capaldi's doctor, progresses inexorably towards evil with Clara helping to bring both to their inevitable conclusion.  In the end It would be Clara who finally ends the suffering of the insane Valeyard by once again sacrificing everything for the Doctor, her love of the Doctor, as she strikes the fatal blow, ending his reign of terror.  It would be her final act of duty that began when she jumped into his timestream, and with the completion of her task, she too would be lost forever.

Speaking of Clara, I agree that this season has been a bit of a letdown as far as her character has been, but i think that, that criticism comes from how good her introduction was.  When they were introducing her character the writers could only hint at her qualities, the impossible girl, allowing the viewers to paint a fuller image of her in our minds, and no matter how ably Jenna Coleman played the part, she would never fill the ideal in every Whovian's mind. That being said, considering the whole of Coleman's work as the impossible girl, I find her to be the tied with Karen Gillan's The girl who Waited as my favorite companion.",false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,null,null,self,The Valeyard cometh!,0,http://www.reddit.com/r/doctorwho/comments/2ica5c/the_valeyard_cometh/

The episode when Clara was ""the monster under the bed"" was ridiculous and no one(at least I didn't want to) wanted to see the doctor ""having a fear"" and explain his childhood. And the aliens in this 8th series were boring or badly explained. This last episode too was rubbish, no sense of tension, danger or explaining what the damn girl was doing on the TARDIS. Since when does the doctor take children on missions like that? It's one to show them the wonder of the universe, it's another to take a high school girl and putting her in danger. I get it, there will be over 20 episodes and there's plenty of time to explain what ""the promised land"" is and until then go on adventures, but at least have a plot device that connects you to the main ""bad guys"". Because I have the feeling that the explanation for the promised land and the bad guys will be a rubbish one. It's something they lacked this season, explaining things, they don't even say: ""I'll explain it later"" anymore. It's like they thought: ""We didn't really think through the episodes until now, but we will figure it out, somehow?""

I'm planning on writing a fan series starring Peter Capaldi as the Doctor and Kate Stewart as the new companion. All scripts should be approximately 45 minutes in length (yes I want you to time how long scenes should take to get time-frames) although I will make 'The Swarm' and 'Mind Games' closer to an hour. This follows from an alternate plotline (perhaps not alternate, depends how Series 8 unravels) that Danny was killed, and Clara is now suffering from depression and has left the TARDIS. However, there is an open book for her to return at some point, and I may even give her a role in the finale. Osgood will be a recurring character, and will also have a small role in the finale. I could also do with someone to make intro titles with Peter Capaldi and Jemma Redgrave just for the lolz (although 6, 7, 8, 9 wouldn't feature Redgrave and instead the most important character of that episode, and 11 and 12 would feature Ingrid Oliver as well as Jemma Redgrave.)

Episode List (these episode titles are not finalized, and may be changed):

Synopses:

(1) The Swarm

Having lost both Clara and Danny, the Doctor returns to London where he meets up with UNIT, led by Kate Stewart. The Doctor would like nothing more than a nice coffee and a chat, but there is something deadly scuttling in the dark...

(4/5) Death From Above/Time Alien

A strange alien artifact has found its way to the UNIT vault - but can the Doctor convince them that it is dangerous, or will they ignore his advice?

(6) Splintered

When the Doctor discovers that his memories do not match the accounts in his diary, he journeys back along his own timeline to find the point of divergence. But when he uncovers a deal with the Trickster Brigade, can he persuade an old friend to make the right choice?

(7) Humans Without Humanity

Many aliens have tried, and failed, to invade human-colonized planets. Just one lone Cyberman, however, might be enough.

(8) Murder in Bavaria

The Doctor travels to Bavaria, 1886, where he meets Ludwig II and visits the beautiful Neuschwanstein Castle. However, a friendly visit soon turns sour, as a terrible dilemma is forced upon Ludwig and the Doctor.

(9) Patient Zero

After being exposed to a unique blend of X-tonic radiation and an alien flu, Elkadi lies stricken in quarantine with a rapidly evolving and seemingly incurable virus. Day 1 of the Stiltskin epidemic, and a page comes through to the nurses working at decontamination zone 1: ""THE DOCTOR IS IN"".

(10) Incus

The Doctor takes Kate and Osgood to the planet Incus, a Human colony in the far future. Here, the most advanced computer in the universe has been created - but does it have a sinister secret?

(11/12) The Epsilon Project/Mind Games

In the far future, the population of Earth has spread among the stars. However, one small town of Newhaven, a utopian society at the North Pole, is still going strong, and it is welcoming of new visitors.",false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,null,null,self,Full Series of Fan Scripts to be made - Alternate Series 9 - Would you like to write an episode?,9,http://www.reddit.com/r/doctorwho/comments/2icfjj/full_series_of_fan_scripts_to_be_made_alternate/

I'm an IT recruiter and I come with a question. I want to make sure I provide the best possible service. 

**When you apply to a job via a recruitment agency, what information do you like to be provided regarding that job?**

Obvious bits might include: 

* The job specification / details of the role. 
* The location of the company this job is with. 
* The website address of the company. 

I'm trying to think outside the box here though and get as wide a snapshot of what people would like as possible. So have a think - has there ever been something you wish was provided but isn't? Or perhaps something that proved incredible useful to you?

##Head To Head

* Chelsea won this fixture 6-0 in March in Arsene Wenger's 1,000th match in charge of Arsenal.
It was the Blues' biggest victory against the Gunners, and only the second time Arsenal have lost a Premier League match by a six-goal margin (along with the 8-2 defeat to Manchester United in 2011).
* Arsene Wenger has failed to win any of his 11 previous encounters with Jose Mourinho (D5, L6).
* The Blues are unbeaten in their last six league and cup games against Arsenal (W4, D2), scoring 12 times and conceding just twice.
* The Gunners' last five Premier League wins at Stamford Bridge have seen them come from behind to win.

First Half:
----------------

Kickoff!

4’ Vertonghen has a nice header off a corner and it’s cleared off the line.

9’ Chance for Mane, but it’s blocked by Naughton who made up for an earlier 

15' Chance on the break for us, but Adebayor is needlessly offside. Stop me if you've heard that one before.

23’ We’ve got possession and are putting on some pressure after a quiet few minutes. Unfortunately we’re still shit at corners.

26’ Great run from Lamela after a pass from Eriksen. Erik takes a shot and Forster pushes it past his post for a corner. Looked like it was going in.  

28’ Hard tackle from Rose on Tadic but he gets no booking. Meanwhile the Saints fans are chanting “Sit down Mauricio”

29’ Uh oh. Not what we need. Naughton gets clipped by Bertrand on the ankle and looks to be in serious pain. Already thin at right back, where is Yedlin when you need him? And it looks like Naughton needs to be subbed.

32' **Tottenham Sub** Eric Dier replaces an injured Kyle Naughton

36’ Left footed shot from distance by Christian Eriksen forces Forster to push it past his post. Good stuff from the Great Dane.

40' **Tottenham Goal!!!** [GIF](http://www.gfycat.com/TerrificUnnaturalKoala)Christian Eriksen!!! Chadli handed it off to Christian at the top of the box and the Great Dane smashed it low and to the left with his right foot, 1-0 Spurs!

43’ What a break from the boys in White. Chadli found himself in on goal and his left footed shot cannons off the post! So close to 2-0!!

45+1’ Tadic free kick takes a deflection and Hugo gets down well to save.

---------------------
Halftime

-There's only one Christian Eriksen.

Second Half:
----------------------

Kickoff!

48' Another poor challenge from a Southampton player, this time on Rose. No yellow card once again.

50’ Free kick for Spurs after nice work by Eriksen. Commentator unable to compliment a spurs player without also mentioning a bad thing about them. “Eriksen’s got quick feet sometimes, but he never has the pace or strength to get away from defenders.”

53’ Yellow card for Kaboul. He’s the last man and goes shoulder to shoulder with Mane who falls over. The color commentator thinks it’s a red and a definite foul, but he would wouldn’t he? Resulting free kick for Saints is taken by Mane straight into the wall.

61’ Dangerous ball in from Clyne and Kaboul clears it ahead of Lloris. Corner is taken and cleared so Spurs can counter. Eriksen finds Chadli who’s 1 on 1 with Ryan Bertrand. Nacer takes a shot and it’s blocked out for a corner by Bertrand. Resulting corner eventually brought out to Eriksen who sends in a ball that Forster mishandles, but no one is there to pounce for Spurs.

64’ Horrendous clearance from Kaboul goes right to Wanyama. Wanyama rips a shot and Hugo dives to his left and saves very well.

66' Of course it's a Yellow for Lamela on a tackle that doesn't even make contact. Terrible call from the ref and there have been many worse fouls deserving of yellows today.

71' Southampton free kick after a foul by Capoue is overhit and out of play.  Color Commentator just said Capoue has sometimes been a lazy player. This guy deserves to get fired for being a fucking dimwit.

74’ Another free kick for Southampton, this one is a pretty dangerous ball. Schneiderlin is matched up with Rose and tries to get some contact on it at the far post, luckily he can’t and Spurs come up unscathed.

76' Adebayor gets the ball in the box but it's stuck under his feet. Calls for a penalty as he goes down but nothing is given. The ball falls to Lamela who tries to make a move but really should have just taken a shot, ball cleared by Saints.

**Southampton Sub** Wanyama off for Long

81’ Some great pressure from Spurs. Consistent pressure with tidy defending at the back. Now a sub.

**Tottenham Sub** Goal scorer Christian Eriksen is replaced by Mousa Dembele. Nice game from the Great Dane!

84’ Big chance for Southampton but Mane has missed a sitter. Bertrand sends in a perfect ball but Mane puts it past the far post. Lucky.

90’ It’s officially squeaky bum time. **Tottenham Sub** Harry Kane replaces Erik Lamela

I liked the lightheartedness of the last doctor... he was funny! This doctor is depressing, he's constantly pissed off and seems a bit fuddy duddy in the head in general... ugh I just don't like him.

And none of the episodes this season have been very good either, not compared to the last few seasons.

I liked the Robin Hood one because it was funny and I liked the Listen one because it was trippy.

But all the other ones I've watched just don't have that same Doctor Who FEEL.

Time Heist was mediocre... it had major plot holes that bothered me... like [Possible Spoiler](#s ""HOW DID THE DOCTOR PLANT THOSE SUITCASES IN ADVANCE?? THAT WAS NEVER EXPLAINED!!!!"")

Barry didn't reply to my last text. People just don't like Barry.

Me and my group of friends thought this was hilarious that this guy Barry was most likely a one night stand and was just a complete arsehole.  So whenever we see the name Barry, we say Fuck You Barry.

Since this month has passed, we've been asking around to try and find the origin of who this Barry could have been.  Maybe he was a lover, misunderstood or just a prick. I'm hoping just by chance one of you people may know or it will just be left a mystery.

**Team Facts**
--------

**Head to Head**

* West Ham are unbeaten the last four times they have hosted QPR (W2, D2).

* QPR's last victory at Upton Park was by 4-0 in August 1993.


**West Ham United**

* This season, the Hammers have picked up more points away from home (four) than they have at Upton Park, where they have won just three points from a possible nine.
* Hammers are coming off a sour 2-1 lose to Man U where they played well despite the result
* A win today would put the hammers in the top half of the table (Their overall tally of seven points is two more than at the same stage of last season)
* Demel's health a bit in doubt, and he isn't in the lineup or on the bench today 
* Sahko is the teams leading scorer with 4 goals.
* West Ham are the only side in the Premier League not to have kept a clean sheet this season.

**Queens Park Rangers**

* Also coming off a 2-1 lose to Southampton
* Currently at the bottom of the table with only 4 points from 6 games
* They are  only Premier League side not to have picked up a point away from home.
* They have scored just one away goal, when Charlie Austin found the net at Southampton last weekend.
* QPR have scored just four goals in total - only Burnley (one) have scored fewer top-flight goals this season.
* Sandro cleared to play today while Joey Barton and Jordon Mutch are nursing hamstring issues and will go through a fitness test.

Then she entered the time stream, completed her role, but now she's still here, and going down hill fast.

Yesterday's episode highlighted that: she cries about wanting independence, but then when she gets it and has to make a choice, she complains even more.

The doctor can not win with her.  She finds a reason to become angry, for no reason, at every turn.

And it goes against her original character, but fits perfectly with the selfish version of her they created this season: ""there's nothing more important than my ego.""

Is it terrible writing that's led to character assassination, or is this being done to make us hate her, for whatever reason?

I'm going to go watch her three good episodes now, just to remember that Jenna does have talent and that it's not her fault her character is terrible.

I moved to Liverpool not long ago so I'm not sure how much interest there will be but here goes.

I am hoping to organise an event to raise money for the charity Womankind - an international human rights charity which works to help transform women's lives across the developing world (see www.womankind.org.uk for more info). They are currently running a huge fund raiser to secure a future for women's rights and I thought perhaps an event in Liverpool could really make a difference!

I am hoping to organise an event where people can volunteer to run a stall for a few hours in order to raise money - it could be doing pretty much anything you feel comfortable with whether that be a bake sale, craft work, henna, hair braiding, apple bobbing - anything you can think of really that you might be happy to do to contribute to this cause.

Would anybody be interested in getting involved and if so what kind of stall might you be happy to run?

Just to be clear, although this is a women's human rights charity I am looking for both men and women to volunteer so please leave a comment or inbox me if you'd like to help out.

Thanks for taking the time to read this post!

Point the first:  
Much as I love being the official unofficial meetup organiser, please don't rely on me to get all the meetups going. I've recently seen quite a few people making posts asking folk to come out and have drinks/coffee and that's great so keep it up! We have a meetup guideline/top tips/faq section in the sidebar and the magic formula is basically to tell people where to be and when. Alcohol helps due to the social lubrication factor.

Point the second:  
The next meetup that I want to organise will be at the end of October and here is where I want to ask how people feel about:  
- weekend of 24th/25th  
- Halloween (Friday 31st)  
or  
- both

Last time we had a meetup for Halloween people came out in costumes and it was pretty fun! 

Due to having adult commitments, I am unable to organise a meetup for any earlier than the 24th/25th. If anybody else is wanting one earlier, just organise one!

From what we have seen so far, who is your top player? Who is making the most consistent contributions thus far? For me, it has been Chadli and Capoue. Chadli is knocking in goals (oh so close to 5 today) and Capoue has been a line of barbed wire sitting in front of our back four. And the barbed wire can pick a hell of a pass.

As for under the radar, I honestly think it's Naughton. The times he has played he has been a solid option at RB. He's been notable in that he really HASN'T been a hot topic of discussion -- just goes out and does his job.

In case anyone missed the earlier post I am co-ordinating a group buy for the /r/cigars Cuban cigar of the month, the H. Upmann Connoisseur A.  The cigar costs about £10 after being converted from euro's and the shipping from Germany to the UK stands at 15 euro to be split per stick as I think this is the fairest way possible to split the cost.  The UK side shipping costs are yet to be determined depending on how you would like it shipped.  The cheapest way would be wrapped in a ziploc bag, that has been wrapped in bubblewrap, inside a padded envelope with some stiff card to keep it from being bent.  I actually think that this will be more secure than the orders that I have received from places like JJFox, where they come in a cardboard carton in a padded envelope.  If anyone is unhappy with this let me know and we can arrange a different method of postage.

If your name isnt on the list below please let me know by PM or by comment here if you want to participate along with the number of sticks that you would like to order.  I will need payment BEFORE ordering from the site from anyone that is not verified on /r/cigars, people verified there can send the money after I buy but before I ship.  Anyone uncomfortable about that can stop reading here.  

The list:

/u/Chaplain-Brawl for 2

/u/Snack-Toxin for 2

/u/dageshi for 2

/u/methane89 for 1

and /u/zombini for 3

Please pm me to confirm that you still want these sticks.

So far the 10 sticks will have a postage of 1.5 euro on each and if the above postage method is acceptable a uk-uk postage of around £2.50 for a total price of 14.3euro each (£11.21) + £2.50 a shipment.  So 1 cigar is going to cost £13.71, but 2 will cost £24.91.

Payment will be bank to bank transfer and I will PM you my sort code and account number for payment once you have all confirmed you still want the sticks.  This transfer can be made for free through your online banking, in branch or through most ibanking apps.  Please include your reddit username in the payment reference so that I know who has paid and who hasnt.  Payment will need to be made before 7pm, (19:00 hours) on Tuesday the 7th of October.

In the unfortunate event of these sticks being picked up by representatives of HMRC I will pay the fee (donations towards said fee would be appreciated of course) but you will have to bear with me for the duration of the inevitable delay.

Presumably both Clara (and possibly Courtney) had children/grandchildren down on Earth anyway, so it was quite literally their responsibility.

…which has led me to the inescapable conclusion that I'm pretty tired of Clara as a companion. Every other companion has bought a wonderful new perspective to the table that can be summed up in a sentence by this point in previous seasons. A perspective that I wanted to see more of.


* Rose - from a humble background and thus and about as far from the Doctor, personality wise, as possible. But bought such a wonderful perspective to the universe it humanised him and bought him out of the dark place he was in.

* Martha - competent and very loyal to a fault.

* Micky - massive inferiority complex, which he didn't need to have. The Doctor knew it and prodded him to greatness until eventually he knew it too. Loyal and came though always.

* Jack Harkness - is Jack Harkness and awesome. Nothing more needs to be said.

* Donna -  a sense of fun about their adventures and the absurdity of it all.

* Amy and Rory - their love for each other and the lengths they would go to preserve it was a wonderful thing to explore over time and space. Especially with Amy's Doctor obsession.

* River - smarmy and smug hiding her vulnerabilities which showed every now and again. Not everybody's cup of tea. But I like her.

* Wilf - no one sentence could do his awesomeness justice. And it was all underscored by his final selfless act.

* Clara - ????

Clara is just reacting to things. 

She had one good start of an observation ""we must just all be like ghosts to you"" when she saw the Doctor absent-mindedly skim through the birth and death of Earth, but it wasn't taken any further.

Even with the introduction of Danny, she's boring. I'll save my judgement on him because his being a soldier and the Doctors view of soldiers might be going somewhere.
