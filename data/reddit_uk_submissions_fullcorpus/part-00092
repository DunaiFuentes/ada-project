Let's say their plan actually worked. They kill him in Utah. His body is burned on a boat. His grave is now on earth...not Trenzalore. His body is now NOT encased inside a protective TARDIS. 
The initial prophecy is now completely irrelevant, which I guess was the intention, but the Universe is at a greater risk given that the Doctor's grave is now on a populated planet without a super secure door that can only be opened by the Doctor's name. (which isn't, I'm told, Please).

So what was the point of The Silence killing the Doctor in Utah?

Also, given that the Doctor is quite difficult to kill, why didn't they go after the person who asked (will ask?) the question instead?

All of series five and six, though, was about the Silence and Madame Vastra wanting to kill The Doctor so that he would never make it to Trenzalore. They made it sound like if The Doctor ever went to Trenzalore and his name really was spoken there, the universe would basically end. But really all that was at stake was The Doctor's life.

First and foremost, John Hurt's 'The Doctor' is not 'The Doctor' as described by Eleven in the episode. He may be the 8th Regeneration, but it was clearly said that he did not carry out his actions in the name of The Doctor, so he's not the Ninth ""Doctor""

So people freaking out about the regen format of Eccelson being the 10th, Tennant being 11th, and Smith being 12th need to calm their britches. Smith is still the 11th Doctor, he's just the 11th regen, where previously he was believed by the 10th.

So that's been settled, but I've noticed that John Hurt's character doesn't have a name, and I think referring to him as The Doctor is a bit disrespectful, considering what he must have done. Eleven clearly doesn't think he's deserving of that title, so we shouldn't either.

------------------------------------------------

1. The Doctor wouldn't recognize him if he was a future doctor, (see Time Crash). At least not right away.

1. His grave on Trenzalor only showed Doctors up to himself, Smith (presumably 11) after Clara jumped into his mind. What I mean to say is, we saw all of his incarnations and nothing **past** himself, because he doesn't know.

1. Someone pointed out earlier but in **The Beast Below** Smith has a speech where he is listing off ways that he will save the day. The third being something along the lines of  
&gt;Three: I kill an innocent beast (creature?) in the least painful way possible and then I find another name for myself because I won't be a (the?) Doctor anymore.

1. The allusion he makes to John Hurt's character is that he broke the promise. He broke the rules The Doctor set forth for himself. If you watch the past series' anytime genocide is brought up The Doctor gets angry, very, very angry. When Davros brings this up, that he is committing genocide of the Daleks and names him their destroyer, The Doctor (then Tennant) is crippled (emotionally, because he tried to save Davros, to not commit genocide, to save one.)

1. All of this points to seeing John Hurt's character as the regeneration **between** the 8th (which only had a movie in the 90's) and the 9th (which was racked with guilt over the time war).

1. As others have pointed out the episode title ""The Name of The Doctor"" could actually be referring not to his real name, as that's not really important except to open his tomb, but the name he chose (which he describes to Clara at the end of this episode as something you choose, you make a pact to uphold it).

1. All of this leads to the conclusion that John Hurt is the incarnation of The Doctor that, at the height of The Last Great Time War, took The Moment (whatever it was/is/may be) and locked the warring factions away. Destroying them. Committing genocide and stripping himself of the name ""Doctor"" (again, see Smiths' speech in **The Beast Below**). 

Every doctor after this Time-War-Ending-Version would not regard John Hurt's life as worthy of the name. As someone who broke the rules. Someone who killed many civilizations.

Someone who killed the great Time Lord Race. 

Clara only see's 11 ""Doctors"" because Eccelstein, Tennant, and Smith, and possibly Hurt (assuming he was who I think he was) disowned that part of themselves from the ""Doctor"" line of their lives.

It could be that when he realized what he was going to do, John Hurt's ""Doctor"", before sealing The Moment, renounced the name ""Doctor"". This could lead to how ""rough"" the reboot in 2005 feels. Eccelstein is reeling from what just happened, trying to come to terms with it all, etc. 

There is an echo of that in Tennant, as well. He refuses to use guns, or any weapon for that matter. He is more PTSD (forgive the phrasing) about genocide/murder/death. Smith is, in some way, a continuation of that it would seem (at least from where I am sitting). Through his entire run (up until now) he has shown that he is still unstable and unable to come to terms with what he did to stop the Time War.

TL;DR: Hurt's character committed genocide and could no longer be considered a ""Doctor""

EDIT:

Adding into this, during **A Good Man Goes to War**, that one soldier (the woman) who helped warn the Doctor and his companions about the Headless monks talks to the Doctor about meeting him before in the Gamma Forests. Unless someone can correct me, Smith stated that (well, after the girl had died) he didn't remember her (or at least implied to Vastra).

The Gamma Forests name for Doctor is Great Warrior. It could be possible that John hurts ""Doctor"" visited there before he used the Moment. This conflicts with her seeming to not care about a face change, but that could be explained by stating she was a child when it happened. It's speculation at best but a fun thought. Moffat, as he has shown, likes putting things like that in.",false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,null,null,self,"[Spoilers, TNofTD] My reasoning behind...",145,http://www.reddit.com/r/doctorwho/comments/1elygj/spoilers_tnoftd_my_reasoning_behind/

A crimson sky settles lightly upon the mountains of Solace, Solitude is not but rubble now. Flame roars from the capital, men, women, beings which visade as children all begin to run. The sky turns to ash, in a moment, in a flare. The loudest noise possible can be heard, echoing wildly above the planet. A blue box flings out, a man in victorian garb stays upon. His eyes stare down, and his face is angry. It is a man who knows he is about to commit an atrocity. 

He pulls a lever, a gun akin to that of a daleks begins to fire from the tardis(s) window, and a flash of white light... Then screams. The man stands alone, the ground below stays in static. Never moving, never shaking. The man stares down, his eyes are filled with rage; With disgust. He slams the door shut, running inside with a swagger and a cry, pulling a lever; A wheeze is heard. The little blue box dematerializing..

 It reappears for half a moment, as if saying ""Why?"" It was a sentient being, after all. Just trapped in a shell, no way to speak. It only had it's parts to speak, and he just spoke with tire. ""I am not the doctor.."" The box begins to leave once more, and he just stares at it's console, sighing tiredly. ""Who am I now?"" He says, taping his fingers on the console. ""The Valeyard?"" He says with curiosity, was this who made him the Valeyard? Did it all fit?.. No. This was not his twelfth regeneration, it was only his ninth. Perhaps he wasn't the doctor, he fingered his goatee for a long moment, considering. 

He just began to shake his head, and  pull a lever, leaving. Staying silent.

Tell me, why does Tim have such rigid morals and such a stereotypical family? It's obvious that expecting an extended stay, The Doctor or should we call him ""The Tool Man"" took a crash course on human culture and stuck firmly to his alien observations?

Tim spends several seasons building a ""hot rod."" *Hot rod*? I think *not*! More like the TARDIS with a different chameleon circuit. And obvious disguise to use the children as free labor to repair her.

Tim: ""No, the last thing you said to me in bed last night was 'no'.""

Jill: ""You're thinking of tonight.""

DOESN'T IT MAKE SENSE PEOPLE!?! TIME IS NOT MOVING LINEARLY FOR HIM! HE'S REMEMBERING THE FUTURE!

To a certain extent, It seems like with every regeneration of the doctor he gets a little younger. Not only this, but when the Master tortures the Tenth Doctor and is degrading him, he turns into a smaller, childlike version of himself. I'm wondering if this is on purpose, or if it could be coincidence.

the obvious answer is that River gets older when she regenerates, but this is early in her life, really. It could be possible that this works as a curve, aging forward, and then reversing.

In conclusion, Christopher Eccleston is the 10th incarnation, David Tennant is the 11th, and Matt Smith is the 12th but are still in correct order as far as the name ""Doctor"" goes. If this is true, it means that there is only one more natural regeneration left. I say natural because it was implied by The Master that Time Lords can be given or awarded more regenerations. Also, the Whisper Men and Silence look far too similar to me and are greatly connected through the 6th and 7th season.

**Things we Know:**

Trenzalore is where the Doctor is ""Buried""

The Tardis goes down with her Doctor (Not captured by someone else)

Clara is ""The Impossible Girl"" because she jumped into the Doctor's time stream, and has appeared to every doctor, even though they might not have heard her [which is similar to the idea that River has helped every doctor and then wiped their memory of her- oddly enough] 

River for sure knows the Doctor's Name. 

River doesn't get saved from the Library

John Hurt is a version of the Doctor


**What we don't know**

What made the Tardis explode at the end of season 5. 

How exactly ""Silence Fell"" (Silence being the religious order) when the question was asked- and why they didn't want the question asked. 

When did the Doctor tell River his name?

IF River is officially gone forever. 

Is John Hurt the Valleyard? Is he a forgotten doctor between 8 and 9? Is he 8 ravaged by the time war? 

In the God Complex: was it John Hurt behind that door?

Is Clara going to be alright? Will we meet more of her over time?

If she only protected 11 faces, does that mean that Matt Smith is the last doctor?


*These are the only ones I can come up with at the moment, feel free to add on, and I'll edit my list.*

So at the end of this short interview there's a referral to a character that they ""can't talk about"" and that this character is also ""very amused"" by the interactions between the David and Matt. After the end of The Name of The Doctor and the introduction of John Hurt as ""The Doctor"" as per the credits I believe there to be another mystery guest appearing on the 50th. From the brief glimpse of John's Doctor I don't get the feeling he is a character to seem ""amused."" Theories?

Figured I'd have myself a River Song marathon once I'm done with my current Doctor Who marathon. To perhaps get a better understanding of what she's been through, without all the reverse order stuff.

I just finished 'Day of the Moon' in my current Who-marathon, and, after her monologue to Rory about never meeting the Doctor in order, and the kiss (his first, her last?) at the end of the episode, I feel I'd really like to see her story played in order. It'd make it much easier for me to identify with the emotions she's going through in DotM and especially what she's going through when The Doctor meets her for the first time in The Library.

It'd also make the death of her physical form in The Library a little more meaningful for me.

Watching River's story episode-to-episode would be kinda difficult, as seen at the end of DofM, we see little Melody Pond regenerate into what I assume ends up being the little girl that befriends little Amy and Rory. It's those little moments that I think I'll need to splice out of an episode and watch them as little intervals between episodes, just to keep her story as chronological as possible. So, help on that would be fantastic.

I've only been a Whovian for about a year, so I'm no expert, but I'm one hell of a dedicated fan. So, any help on this would be appreciated.  I may not be the only fan who'd appreciate it.

The Great Intelligence called the Doctor ""blood-soaked"". He said he killed 10 billion people at his final battle at Trenzalore. He said that was one of his more minor skirmishes. He said the Doctor will be known by other names in the future: ""The Storm. The Beast.""

This is the Doctor's biggest secret: he is the ultimate evil in the universe's future. He probably destroys the ENTIRE UNIVERSE in the future. That's what the Silence are trying to stop. That's why the militarized church is out to get him. That's why the Pandorica was built for him. To save the future of the universe.

And his name reflects that, whatever it is. That's who John Hurt is playing. The original him. BEFORE he CHOSE the name ""Doctor"". He destroyed the universe, perhaps he had no choice. But he escaped back into the past, regenerated into William Hartnell, and made a promise to himself. To be the Doctor. To be a healer. And he's been at it for 11 regenerations.

From there we find out that the reason The Doctor locked his own people along with the majority of the Daleks was because they intended to ascend to a higher plane of existence at the expense of all other life in the universe. Understandably, 10 could not allow them to come back and do the same thing again and so he prevented their return. This sort of validated his choice and gave the ""Time War PTSD"" that had plagued both 9 and 10 a bit of a close. 11 is subtly morose but not as directly affected by it as much as by the overall angst of being The Doctor.

So why would Dr. 8.5/Hurt/Malpractice/Not-Doctor etc. still be vilified by 11 - and, for now, by extension the show - for something 10 basically approved of and reinforced while there seems to have no problem with 10? The Time Lords were villains and they needed to be stopped. 8.5 and then 10 stopped them. Even if we talk of the genocide in general, the Meta-Crisis Doctor did not get much of a punishment for exterminating (irony intended) multiple planets worth of Daleks. Moffat would not be one to ignore all this history. 

So could there be another crime we are yet to hear about? I'm conflicted in thinking so since adding another mystery to the same era of the Time War when the Time War is still a major mystery does not seem like Moffat either. I must be missing something somewhere.

I recently watched the Pandorica/Big Bang 2-part. After tonight's episode, and reading some of the theories people are coming up with in regards to The Doctor's time stream, Clara, and Hurt Doctor, I started really pondering how much the ""Big Bang"" was really able to recreate.
We don't know the events surrounding the Time War, but we do know that it involved the Daleks and the Time Lords. We've seen the Daleks and Cybermen outside the Pandorica, and in other places, and we know that both races now exist outside the time lock of the time war, and Gallifrey. We can only imagine that both of these races are building their numbers.
So the number one question I have, is Why the time lock? What could the Doctor (or the Hurt Doctor) have done that needed to seal this moment in time? In ""The End Of Time"" the Time Lords didn't seem like they were in a war mentality, more of a prison mentality. And we know Rassilon is pretty damn selfish at this point.
In ""Journey to the Centre of The Tardis"" The Doctor hinted at the Time Rift from Series 5, and the ability to use them to re-write history. So could something have happened after ""The Big Bang"" to cause certain points of The Doctor's life to be re-written or ""unsealed"" from the Time Lock?
Also, other than some of the Time Lords being some ruthless mofos, why does it seem that they are the only race still needing to be stuck in the time lock? One would think that this ""Time War"" isn't over if Daleks are still out there repopulating...and the Time Lords might be needed to fight whatever the Daleks come up with next.
Could Moffat be building up for another retcon of the Time Lock? Perhaps using another Time Rift/Rewrite history type of device? I assume that ""Fixed point"" wibbly wobbly...but to me, the Pandorica/Big Bang and Tardis time rifts seem like more than just wibbly wobbly. They were history re-existing.
I know that this is a farther reaching theory, that really doesn't address Clara &amp; Hurt Doctor's role in the story, but we know that some big information about the Time War is coming down the pipe, and one can assume that ""Asylum of the Daleks"" isn't the last time we see the Daleks.
I do have my own questions about the way this ""Time stream jump"" into the Doctor's life works....If Clara and The Doctor were both able to enter it without dying, then how can we assume the Great Intelligence died? If the Doctor somehow removes/rescues Clara, doesn't that mean she's no longer split throughout the Doctor's life to save him over and over again? It's all confusing. Still interesting though, a decent plot device for introducing 11 to his former selves.
If I were a Doctor Who writer, (And realizing that while 11 wouldn't call Hurt Doctor ""The Doctor"" but the show's writers weren't afraid to call him ""The Doctor"" right before the ""To be continued..."" screen)... I'd write that 10, 11, Rose, Clara, and Hurt are going through the Doctor's time stream killing versions of the Great Intelligence. And that this is the way in which Hurt ""becomes"" 9, and ""wins"" the title of ""The Doctor"" from the others, in the process perhaps convincing his other two selves that the Time War isn't over, and that drastic measures need to be taken to stop the Daleks. Thus, unsealing the Time Lords.

Remember, the Silence are attempting to prevent the Doctor from answering ""the oldest question in the universe"" on the Fields of Trenzalore where ""no living creature can speak falsely or fail to answer"". This would be both the Fall of the Eleventh and would be followed by Silence.

Notice that none of these things happened in this episode: The Eleventh did not fall. The Doctor didn't answer the question. And there was nothing in this episode about living creatures being unable to speak falsely.

There are two things to understand here:

First, you're probably forgetting the *other side* of these events. The Doctor's grave is built on the Fields of Trenzalore after a great battle is fought there. I think we can safely assume at this point that the events the Silence fear (whatever they are) actually lie in the battle itself, not the graveyard which follows it.

Second, John Hurt is almost certainly playing the 9th regeneration of the Doctor. That means that, while there may only be eleven Doctors, Matt Smith is now the 12th version of the person who is referred to as the Doctor in most of this incarnations. This means that Moffat has manipulated events so that the next regeneration of the Doctor will be his 13th; which means that his next regeneration will be the Valeyard.

Given that Moffat has also name-dropped the Valeyard, I can't really believe that this is a coincidence: He's got a story that he wants to tell, and he's setting up the pieces for it.",false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,null,null,self,The Fields of Trenzalore,9,http://www.reddit.com/r/doctorwho/comments/1emgu6/the_fields_of_trenzalore/

On the other hand...

The Silence tried to kill the Doctor to prevent the fruition of a specific prophecy, which stated: ""On the fields of Trenzalore, at **the fall** of the eleventh, **when no living creature can speak falsely or fail to answer**, a Question will be asked, a question that must never, ever be answered.""

+ But the Doctor fails to answer when G.I. asks him the question!

+ EVERY living creature failed to answer. With Clara's memory back there were 2 people who knew the Doctor's name. Yet it was River who answered, and River is dead.

+ It was ""a fall"". not ""THE fall"". The Doctor fell a million times before!

What I am getting at is that the prophecy is not yet fulfilled, and maybe, just maybe, it refers to a completely different event. The Silence ARE trying to stop the Doctor, but not this event. It'll be something in the future.

Other proofs:

~17mins: the Doctor says the graves in Trenzalore are from his final battle.

~22mins: Doctor lives in darker and darker hues day upon day. And he will have other names before the end. The Storm, The Beast, The Valeyard

**EDIT 1/Further Proof:**

http://i.imgur.com/YwThqu2.jpg

I am betting there will be a war, and it will be soon. The Doctor needs not die (he escapes certain death before many-a-times ala Tessalecta) but I sincerely doubt that this was the prophecy of the Silence. We were promised a showdown in the Fields of Trenzalore, and there will be one. The graves prove it.

+ Silence will fall when the question is asked... Silence MUST fall

Was there any Silence or even ""silence""? You could argue that the stars were going out would qualify, but the stars also went out during Big Bang Two and the exploding TARDIS was caused by, as far as we know, by the Silence.

Of course that could have easily been explained by a single line ""G.I. was behind it"", but it wasn't. And I don't think the Silents would not show up for a battle, a battle their cult was formed to prevent. After all, they created River Song to fight on their side in an ""endless, bitter war"" (according to Madam Korvian)

It's still a theory though. But it will be very Moffat-y for two similar events both of which coincide with a single prophecy.

**EDIT 2/Further Speculation:**

Now that we know the nature of The Name of The Doctor, we can also perhaps extrapolate that when in the Fields of Trenzalore, when he will be asked *Doctor Who?* He will have to make a decision on who the Doctor is. The morally ambiguous John Hurt Doctor or the Matt Smith Doctor? 

The answer to Doctor Who? is a choice between the nature/Name of The Doctor, not the Doctor's name that would open a lock!

Perhaps by choosing the wrong nature of The Doctor... he had caused the horrors that Madam Korvian is afraid off. The endless war she referred to, leading to the creation of the Silence. Maybe that is the event that the Silence are trying to prevent. Maybe the Silence are not here to protect the past from G.I, but protect the future from... The Doctor.

Proof:

Wedding of River Song, ~10 mins, Dorian: ""You are a man with a long and dangerous past, but your future is infinitely more terrifying. The Silence believe it must be averted.""

~12mins, The Doctor: ""All the times I have heard the question I didn't realize it was my silence... my Death...

If this is the case then I have a theory on the future of the show. Matt Smith would be the 12th life of the Doctor meaning he only has 1 left. With how popular the show is, I don't see the creators wanting to put their backs up against the wall with that. So what I think could end up happening is that we will soon see the return of the Time Lords somehow. The Time Lords are able to give a new cycle of regenerations so The Doctor could earn himself another 13. I would think that that would probably be more for another reboot down the line but they could resolve him being the last Time Lord now so that by the time the 13th is done, they have something to fall back on.

However, there are major differences between the Clara's case and the Rose's case. Rose spread herself through the all time and space. It may seems obvious that her power as a Bad Wolf was much greater than Clara's. But that may be not true. 

When Rose became Bad Wolf, she was still a corporeal being, locked in her own body. Clara is different; she is not a human at all now, she is something different, chained to the lifetime of the Doctor. And since she is not limited by time or her own body, she is now much more intelligent and influential than Rose or Clara's echoes ever were - she can engineer Doctor's life in much more powerful ways than previous companion.

And what is very important - she is not strictly limited to the timeline of the Doctor - the incarnations she creates must just cross the timeline of the Doctor. In different case, she will be not able to meaningfully interact with him. 


Then, it seems clear to me that there is no original Clara at all; there is a loop with godlike being creating itself throu woman we call Clara. The same with Great Intelligence(Yog Sothoth - ""I'm the gate, i'm the key"", if you know what I mean - there was an allusion to that quote in the episode)


We know now also that Clara don't need to be human - it's almost certain that Clara who talk to the first Doctor on Gallifrey is a Time Lord. If not, why is she allowed to be on Gallifrey, with TARDISes? And why did she know which TARDIS has what faults?

And if there is possibility of changing the species the same possibility is open for Yog-Sothoth. There was a mention about Valeyard - It may be that Great Intelligence will bring him to life or even, in some weird sense, becomes him.

TL;DR:

1. Clara and Yog-Sothoth are essentially divine.

2. They are capable to manifest in different forms, much more different than the ""original"" ones.

3. They are NOT limited strictly to the Doctor's lifetime - their incarnations must just cross the Doctor's lifetime. In different case, they will be to young to meaningfully interact with the Doctor.

4. It is possible that Great Intelligence creates or becomes the Valeyard.

We know that the four beat was actually the heartbeat of a timelord so why would he see it as the drums of war? Easy, it was Rassilon's heartbeat and Rassilon's lust for war and *his* madness bleeding through. 

Remember the master was just a child when they did that to him he had no way to resist or keep out Rassilon's influence. The master wasn't a villain, he was a victim. 

It's also a safe assumption that Rassilon's control weakened when he attempted to kill the doctor, if you look at this clip here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cfyye1rTfdg you can see a look of deep concentration/effort on  Rassilon's face as if he is already exhausted. Well who wouldn't be after sending a signal that broke a time lock?  He wouldn't be able to (from his perspective) keep it up very long and focusing on killing the doctor was just enough to break his control. Now look at the masters face when he tells the doctor to get out of the way, he is focused, angry and *lucid*. It's clear he realizes now what was done to him and he chooses while he can to save his childhood friend from the monster that tormented him his whole life.



The master isn't evil, he was being controlled and the moment he was able to choose for himself he chose to be a hero, sacrificing himself to save all of reality from the horrors of the time war.

He's the regeneration between McGann and Eccleston. He's the one who pushed the button to end the Time War - burning the cosmos, 

committing genocide against his whole race, and sectioning off an entire area of space and time, cursing himself and raging at the 

dying of the light every second of it. He's basically the Doctor at his absolute worst, his lowest of moments, something even the 

Valeyard himself might shy away from. He committed an atrocity.

The reason I think he regenerated into Eccleston and from McGann is because Eccleston's Doctor had a vicious, vicious case of 

self-hatred and survivor's guilt going on (like seriously, the man was so fucking angry and disgusted with himself it was somewhat 

difficult to watch) which would make sense considering what he did, and he was going out of his way to avoid bloodshed on the same 

scale, even allowing the hybrid Dalek empire to decimate Earth rather than set off the Delta Wave - and because McGann was 

explicitly the 8th Doctor.

So Matt Smith is the 11th Doctor in ""name"" but he is actually the 12th iteration of the man we know as The Doctor - because John 

Hurt's version did something so deplorable and so unlike everything the Doctor stands for that he doesn't consider that aspect of 

himself worthy of the title.

Also they decided to kill Clara initially, but changed their mind for some reason

Also apparently there'll only be one more Doctor after Smith :(

* If just a projection, how did she change the tea to champagne? And drink it?
* Can she freely roam independently or does she have to stay by the Doctor's side / near the TARDIS? How does that impact how she was able to go to the Conference?
* People could see her at the Conference. (And knew enough about her to send her an invitation in the first place) Why did the Doctor think nobody could see her during their kiss? (Especially since she had earlier fed Clara questions to ask about the gravestone.)
* Why would she tell Clara to NOT go into the scar rift? Staying out of it would cause the Doctor great physical pain as all his previous selves are killed. It would also destroy the universe as we saw stars going out. This directly contradicts River's actions in Wedding where she let time disintegrate only until she had the chance to tell the Doctor that he was loved (and by her most of all) and that she'd spend the rest of her life in prison to prove it to him. Her telling Clara to stay out would have neither of these effects. It would still cause the Universe to suffer AND it would cause the Doctor to suffer. There's no upside here.

The time war ending has always been described in the same way, that Gallifrey ""burned"" and the time lords/daleks along with it. Which always seemed odd, since war between two races who can travel through space and time would cover more than just the one planet.

So... I'm thinking that what the doctor did to end the time war is essentially the same thing that the GI did to the doctor in this episode. He went into the time stream of gallifrey itself and re-wrote history. Then he somehow escaped the same way he does with clara at the end of the finale, which isn't entirely revealed.

We don't really know how the escape is going to happen just yet, but we know massive chunks of history where completely re-written. So lets say the doctor didn't expect to survive destroying gallifrey's timestream, but somehow he did and at the same time 'reset' his regeneration (Since the time war 'never happened' so regenerating from 8 to 9 as a result of the war 'never happened'). Which explains why the doctor knew who the betrayer was, but clara didn't see him when she moved through his past.

The existence of the Valeyard has been negated by changes in The Doctor's ""time line"" since then. 

My personal view is that The Doctor now has unlimited regenerations, since it is indicated from the show's history that the Time Lords controlled regenerations artificially.

I know this was never stated specifically, and the canon is unclear about regeneration - but it can be argued that the Time Lords artificially control regenerations from what we have seen. They forced 2 to regenerate into 3. They resurrected The Master and it seems also Rassilon (except he wasn't really dead .. or something..)

The limit on Regenerations was probably artificial. 

So stop thinking that The Valeyard is a definite and there are only 13 regenerations. All that has changed!

It is not necessarily  what I think happened, just something I thought was worth some discussion.

Firstly, a lot of people are saying that he cannot be the valeyard because the valeyard comes between the 12th and 13th incarnations of the doctor. This was stated in the TV series in the ""Trial of a Time Lord"" serial. In this serial the valeyard arrives to act as a prosecutor for the doctors trial. The doctor was put on trial by the timelords.

This poses a problem. Since the revival of the show we have been told that the doctor is alone, and that no more time lords exist. They are all trapped in the time war, and the war itself is time locked, meaning that nothing can get in or out. If this is truly the case then the valeyard could not possibly travel back to appear in the doctors trial.

For the valeyard to participate in a trial put on by timelords then he would need to be able to interact with the timelords. One possibility is that one day the time lock will be removed. This is definitely a possibility, and I am not ruling it out.

However, there is another possibility. I believe that the time war has drastically altered the timeline of the universe, meaning that the valeyard might appear at a different point in the doctors life. It means anything we know about the doctors future from before the time war is in doubt.

This is where I start to guess, and ""theory"" portion of this post begins :P

What if in the final days of the time war, the doctor realises that he is not capable of destroying his own people. He knows that the war must be stopped, but cannot bring himself to pull the trigger.

Knowing that he cannot do what needs to be done, he forces himself to regenerate into the valeyard. The valeyard takes the moment and does what needs to be done, and also manages to escape the time war in the process. At this point I assume something happens that results in him regenerating into the 9th.

That is the theory. I know I am taking a huge leap in logic here, and I am essentially just guessing. I just thought it would be something worth talking about. I look forward to seeing what you all think

**Match Pointers**

* Everton have won only one of their previous 20 visits to Stamford Bridge in the top flight – 1-0 in November 1995 with Paul Rideout getting the goal
* Chelsea have taken the most points (17) in games between the current top six this season
* Juan Mata has provided more assists than anyone else in the division in 2012-13.
* Five of the last six league meetings at Stamford Bridge have been draws, Chelsea winning the other encounter 3-1 last season.
* For Chelsea to be forced into a play-off with Arsenal they would need to draw while the Gunners win, outscoring them by two goals in the process.
* This will be Chelsea's 69th game of the season compared to just 45 for Everton.
* **An afternoon of goodbyes at Stamford Bridge.**
* David Moyes is guaranteed a rapturous farewell from the Everton fans and it just possible that Rafael Benítez may finally be shown some appreciation by the Chelsea supporters after Wednesday’s dramatic Europa League triumph.
* Chelsea must also win tomorrow to be sure of finishing third. 
* A draw and there would be the prospect of a play-off against Arsenal to conclude their epic 70-game. 
* As everyone now knows, the Londoners are the first club ever to be holders simultaneously of the Champions League and Europa League and the only English side to have won all three major UEFA trophies.
* The win adds a date for your diary: the UEFA Super Cup in Prague on 30 August, against either Bayern Munich or Borussia Dortmund.
* And what a week for Frank Lampard: new club-record goalscorer, captain of the Europa League winners and signed up for another year at the Bridge.
* There is rumors Paulo Ferreira will be retiring today, couldn't find any credible source to confirm this.

**MILESTONES**

* Chelsea's next victory in front of our own supporters will be our 250th in the Premier League at Stamford Bridge.
* If selected, Frank Lampard will play his 50th Chelsea game of the season and Cesar Azpilicueta will make his 50th appearance this term for club and country.
* Congratulations to Petr Cech who celebrates his 31st birthday on Monday (20th) and Demba Ba his 28th on May 25th.

**DAYS SINCE**

* Chelsea lost in the league to Everton at Stamford Bridge: 6,749
* Everton lost in London: 494
* Liverpool won the league: 8,415
* Arsenal won a trophy: 2,920

1. To me it seemed as The Doctor already had his last date with River before she went to the library but when did she get to learn his name?

2. How did The Doctor and GI know that Trenzalore was where the Doctor was burried?

3. When The Doctor entered his own time stream, wouldnt he have seen his own future then? Or was he meant to die by the GI at Trenzalore? If so the time stream would have ended there with him, but now he survived so he shouldnt be burried there or what?

    Luis Suarez scored twice in the corresponding fixture - a 3-0 win for Liverpool in Harry Redknapp's seventh game in charge.
    The Reds are undefeated against QPR at Anfield in the Premier League (W4, D1). Indeed Liverpool have won 18 of the 21 league meetings on home soil (D2, L1).

Liverpool

    Liverpool have scored the most Premier League goals since January 1 (39).
    The Reds are unbeaten in their last seven games (W3, D4) and have only conceded three times in their last six.
    Only Arsenal and Manchester City have a better second-half record than Liverpool this season, (W17, D12, L8).
    Daniel Sturridge has scored six times in his last four games. The former Chelsea striker has 10 goals and three assists in 13 Premier League appearances for Liverpool.
    Since his Premier League debut in Feb 2011, Liverpool have won more games without Luis Suarez (58%) than with him (39%).

QPR

    The Hoops have scored only one goal in their last 455 minutes of Premier League football, Loic Remy's penalty against Newcastle last time out.
    Harry Redknapp's side are without a win in their last eight games (D2, L6).
    Excluding Remy's penalty, QPR managed only one shot on target last time out against Newcastle.
    Remy is QPR's top scorer this season with six goals - he has only appeared in 13 Premier League games.
    Only Derby County (one in 2007-08) and Sunderland (three in 2005-06) have won fewer games in a Premier League campaign than QPR this season (four).

Line-ups:

**Liverpool:**
Reina, Johnson, Enrique, Carragher, Skrtel, Lucas, Henderson, Downing, Ibe, Coutinho, Sturridge

**QPR:**
 Green; Harriman, Onuoha, Hill, Traore, Derry, Park, Remy, Zamora, Townsend, Mbia

So firstly, the idea that the Doctors biggest secret is John Hurts regeneration who released the moment is lacking some ‘Moffat’ to me. The Doctor openly admits to being the one to release the moment!

The concept that 'Smiths Doctor' wouldn't know 'Hurts doctor' as he is a later regeneration makes sense. But what if there time line has already crossed in a stage of the Doctors life we know very little about? (Yes! I’m hinting the time war!)

What if, say the 13TH Doctor, is John Hurt, and he came back to release the moment and save Eccleston from the time war?

This would result in the Doctors secret, not being that he has released the moment, but that he still has to!! We have always assumed he is running from his past, but what if he is running from his future?

 - How are Edinburgh Leisure gyms, or specifically, Leith Victoria gym?

 - Pure Gym is cheaper and with a smaller joining fee, is it noticeably worse?

 - Will Pure Gym (specifically the OT one) always be packed to the point of it being useless?

 - Can I get any student discount at these places? (the websites are hiding it well if they do offer discount)

Update: Did a bit of checking and even though I'm a student, the fact I'm not a UoE student makes it pretty expensive :P Also Edinburgh Leisure seems a bit pricey and feedback was lukewarm, so I'll give it a miss.

I am caught between so many emotions, but the one that stands out the most is grateful. The title of this post is such because as I sit here thinking, there is no title that can fully explain what you'll be reading here. 
     I've never been big into reddit, and before this year, I wasn't terribly big into football. Obviously, I knew how to play and watch the sport, but throughout this year I have truly come to understand the tactics and the love for one team, my club, Tottenham Hotspur. When I say 'my club,' I mean our club. When the term club is used, I am talking about every single person involved with the club, from players, to fans, to staff. 
     This season we have seen a team who have come together to become exactly what we've seen today: a brotherhood. Andrè Villas Boas has become my idol, I look up to him, watch how he acts, listen to what he says and how he says it. He is the most professional man I have ever seen for his age, and you have seen it rub onto our players throughout this year. Tottenham are not an arrogant club. We do not attack others, we do not attack new fans, we are accepting, and patient with our club, even the lesser players who need time to grow. 

I could sit here and write for hours about everything and anything that I'm feeling right now, but I know none of you would want that as I'm sure there are many similar posts going up right now similar to mine. I just want to say thank you to every fan who is reading this right now. As a fan from the US, I can honestly say there is no other team I'd rather support than Spurs. I refuse to look at this season as a disappointment. We lost some crucial players last summer, but also picked up some incredible players as well. I can only look to next season with as much eagerness as I'm sure the rest of you will. AVB will have a full offseason to coach our young team exactly what tactics he wants to implement, as well as bring in more players that should help us reach our objectives next season. Also, although there was a clear look of disappointment and uncertainty on the face of Gareth as that final whistle blew, I think it is safe to say that he needs us as much as we need him, and I do believe he will stay.

Even though you can read this quote on the right side of your screen, I think it is so important to all of us and what our club stands for, that it is my duty to write it here: ""It is better to fail aiming high than to succeed aiming low. And we of Spurs have set our sights very high... so high, in fact, that even failure will have in it an echo of glory."" 

Thank you everyone, for a season I will never remember,

Ok, I know you all think John Hurt is 8.5, and time-locks the war. But why would *that* be the Doctor's biggest secret? Everyone already knows the Doctor basically sacrificed the rest of his people to get rid of the Daleks, and the Doctor has said multiple times that it was necessary and justified it by saying the Time Lords had grown violent and weren't themselves anymore, and he was saving the rest of the universe from the war. But this secret is supposed to be something HUGE, that no one knows. Something big enough to bring him to tears. Not to mention, Clara was scattered across all parts of the Doctor's timeline, and if this Nega-Doctor is in the Doctor's past, why didn't Clara see him when she saw all of his other forms? Maybe you're all right and he is 8.5 and time-locks the war, but, personally, I think they've got something planned that is MUCH bigger than that for is biggest secret. These are just my thoughts. I think there is much more to John Hurt than just being 8.5. Also, does this mean that we're going to have a bunch of flashback adventures with him when the show resumes in November?

I am caught between so many emotions, but the one that stands out the most is grateful. The title of this post is such because as I sit here thinking, there is no title that can fully explain what you'll be reading here. I've never been big into reddit, and before this year, I wasn't terribly big into football. Obviously, I knew how to play and watch the sport, but throughout this year I have truly come to understand the tactics and the love for one team, my club, Tottenham Hotspur. When I say 'my club,' I mean our club. When the term club is used, I am talking about every single person involved with the club, from players, to fans, to staff. 
This season we have seen a team who have come together to become exactly what we've seen today: a brotherhood. Andrè Villas Boas has become my idol, I look up to him, watch how he acts, listen to what he says and how he says it. He is the most professional man I have ever seen for his age, and you have seen it rub onto our players throughout this year. Tottenham are not an arrogant club. We do not attack others, we do not attack new fans, we are accepting, and patient with our club, even the lesser players who need time to grow.
       I could sit here and write for hours about everything and anything that I'm feeling right now, but I know none of you would want that as I'm sure there are many similar posts going up right now similar to mine. I just want to say thank you to every fan who is reading this right now. As a fan from the US, I can honestly say there is no other team I'd rather support than Spurs. I refuse to look at this season as a disappointment. We lost some crucial players last summer, but also picked up some incredible players as well. I can only look to next season with as much eagerness as I'm sure the rest of you will. AVB will have a full offseason to coach our young team exactly what tactics he wants to implement, as well as bring in more players that should help us reach our objectives next season. Also, although there was a clear look of disappointment and uncertainty on the face of Gareth as that final whistle blew, I think it is safe to say that he needs us as much as we need him, and I do believe he will stay.

Even though you can read this quote on the right side of your screen, I think it is so important to all of us and what our club stands for, that it is my duty to write it here: ""It is better to fail aiming high than to succeed aiming low. And we of Spurs have set our sights very high... so high, in fact, that even failure will have in it an echo of glory.""
Thank you everyone, for a season I will never forget,

I think a lot of people dislike Eleven simply because his run is so much different from Nine and Ten, which is great, because it shows character development, we seem to forget that the Doctor, while not human, still makes mistakes and more importantly he learns from them.

I assume that Nine came to be right after the Time-war, but what a lot of people tend to ignore is that he killed his entire race, he wiped them all from existence, which leaves him to be the last one. The last Timelord in existence, imagine what that does to a man, to be forced to not only carry the burden of being the last of your race but to also know that you are solely responsible for that. In my eyes, Nine decided to visit earth one last time, he wanted to visit the planet where he landed all those years ago and had many adventures with so many companions. I believe that he even contemplated suicide and just wanted to feel joy one last time, that is until he met Rose, he couldn't resist the urge of going on one last adventure, unable to imagine how that simple girl could change his life for the better, throughout the first season we see him happy and cheerful but we can sense that there's a certain darkness inside him, he knows how to hide it well but occasionally you can tell that he's still burdened by his massive loss, but he slowly opens up to Rose and while not entirely honest, he learns how to trust her, skipping to the end of the series, he has to regenerate and while he's not in complete control of what body he'll end up having, we know from River and the Master that Timelords can somewhat influence their next body (Mels focusing on a dress-size, The Master wanting a younger body after regenerating from Professor Yana). I think he knew that he needed someone who could more easily open up to people and thus Ten was born.

The major difference between Nine and Ten is that Ten wears his heart on his sleeve, he's far too emotional for his own good and after losing that special person who saved him from certain death, he tries to find someone new because Donna told him he needed someone. Unfortunately the new companion, Martha, fell in love with him and he could not bear to have feelings for her, knowing that Rose is still out there, waiting for him. He's happy for a while because for once a companion chose to leave, he did not have to abandon her and he simply moved on, until he met Donna, who was the most important woman in the universe and acted like she was his equal, even though she was human, teaching him humility. After her departure and finally knowing that Rose and his previous companions would be okay without him, he could finally move on, become someone the universe needed, someone who could hide his history by being playful and silly and yet still care deeply for those close to him and be able to show it when he needed to, the Eleventh Doctor.

While he acts childish and pretends to be happy go-lucky, he is probably one of the darkest Doctors, he has lost so many and felt so much pain that he knows he can no longer share it with the world because no-one will truly understand him, he's decided to just make other people's lives better so that he can feel better about himself. When someone finally tries to harm those he cares about, he snaps and will not hesitate to do whatever's in his power to protect them. 
As seen in The Girl Who Waited, he will not hesitate to even hurt the people he's trying to protect in order to save them from true harm. [Spoiler Description](#s ""He knew he couldn't save both Amy's so he had no problem with lying to them in order to keep one of them safe"") 

So in conclusion, we've seen the Doctor growing up, he's gone from someone truly hurt and emotionally scarred, thinking that the universe is better off without him to someone who's trying to be a better man, to make the universe a better place even if it means sacrificing everything he has.

My questions, however:

- Can someone help me explain (or have a good theory) what exactly was going on with River's story this episode? If she was an echo, how was she capable of projecting herself outside CAL from the Library? What did her statement about being connected to Clara mean exactly?

- There's nothing entirely special about Clara, so how exactly was she able to stop the Great Intelligence across every single moment of the Doctor's life?

- What exactly do you think The Doctor's secret is? Because if the secret is ""I stopped the time war by committing genocide,"" then the Doctor is really, really bad at keeping that secret, since we've already been privy to that information since Nine.

 Doesn't this possibly set her her up to be a much more sympathetic and intimate companion?  Or has she forgotten all of her various lives?  

Also, is it possible that the Clara currently has is one of the Echoes and that the real Clara is still out there, waiting to be found such as Flesh Amy?  But I imagine that would have torn her apart, unless she was split up again from something else?  

I'm not really sure, and I wanted to see what the fandom thinks. 
Although, I'm probably going to get down voted into oblivion for this.

If people enjoy this little game I may add a few twists. The goal is to reach top 4 next year so upvote the teams you feel have the best chance of doing so.

**Scenario:** The 2012-2013 season has just ended and unfortunately Liverpool leaves with no silverware. They have only improved to 7th place but what most don't realize they have played some outstanding football. The Rodgers System is finally in full effect and its time for Rodgers to build Liverpool into a Top 4 team. Easier said than done.
A few weeks in and the following deals have already been completed:

1. Andy Carroll to West Ham- 17m

2. Jay Spearing to Bolton- 3m

3. Martin Skrtel to Zenit- 10m

4. Luis Suarez to Bayern Munich- 25m (twist 3)

FSG has given you 20m so now you have a total of 75m to spend in this window. They are not allowing you to sell anymore players so that is all you got. They also have given you a list of requirements you must fulfill in this window or you will be sacked.

**Requirements:**

1. You may only buy players under the age of 25

2. Must buy a starting centre back to replace Skrtel (can't be Kelly/wisdom)

3. Must buy a center defensive mid that can cover for the injury prone Lucas

4. Must buy a left back that can compete with Enrique for the starting spot

5. Must loan at least 2 young players

**Rules:**

1. All players can be purchased for their market value on http://www.transfermarkt.co.uk/

2. Players that are not in the requirements are allowed to be bought so long as the actual requirements have been met.

3. Manchester United, Everton, and Swansea City have all decided they will not sell to you under any circumstance

4. Buyout clauses do not apply

5. Players that would be free agents are not free. Assume everyone has gotten a 1 year contract. (Ince isn't free)

6. Cannot sell any players that have not already been sold unless a twist tells you otherwise

7. All redditors playing should submit a post containing the players they signed, their values, and a starting lineup and bench

8. No single transfer can cost over 50% of the entire transfer budget

9. You are free to criticize and discuss people's lineups

**Twists:** (lineups can be edited to suit these, not realistic just trying to make this more challenging)

1. Real Madrid reports that they will sell Xabi Alonso for a fee of 12m, Alonso has told the media that he wants to return to Liverpool and would take a reasonable pay cut to do so. FSG has told Brendan Rodgers that they would agree to sign Xabi. Xabi Alonso will not settle for being a bench player and he must fit into the starting lineup which may prove difficult seeing as Gerrard has adapted to the ""Alonso position."" If you choose not to sign Alonso then he will be signed by a rival premier league team that I will not disclose just yet but him going to this particular team will hinder Liverpool's chances at top 4. 

2. Rafa Benitez has been appointed as the new manager of Everton. He has already signed Fernando Torres, Javier Mascherano, and he is in contract talks with Xabi Alonso right now. (They made up for some reason and Everton decided they wanted to spend money for once). Xabi Alonso wants to go to Liverpool but if no offer turns up he will go to Everton. If he goes to Everton he will be a great replacement for the departed Fellaini and Everton will be a very strong side. Now will you snag Xabi first?

3. Every Liverpool fans worst nightmares have just become a reality. Suarez has put in a transfer request late in the window and had to be sold to Bayern Munich for a small 25m. You now have 75m to work with. You must now scramble to buy a world class forward to replace him before the day ends. Lewandoski has already gone to Munich as well so he cannot be bought.

NOTHING TOO BIG BUT IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN IT DON'T READ. So am I the only one that thinks that The Name of The Doctor was a pretty good episode but not exactly ""amazing""? I don't know maybe I hyped it up to myself too much but I felt it was lacking. It all  happened too quickly and there was no build up to it. The only reason it was good was because of the information they revealed and amazing cinematography.  Also the Doctor had like two lines, I expected an amazing Matt Smith speech/performance like his first episode with the Atraxi, or at the Pandorica, or like the Ring of Akhaten speech or his performance in Nightmare in Silver. The prophecy also says  ""On the fields of Trenzalore, at the fall of the eleventh, when no living creature can speak falsely or fail to answer, a question will be asked, a question that must never, ever be answered."" , except Dr. Simeon asked the first question several times yet the Doctor stood in silence.

Where John Hurt is, numerically speaking, doesn't really interest me all that much.

What really interests me is what he did to break the promise of The Doctor.

Doctor: He is my secret.

JH: What I did, I did without choice,

Doctor: I know.

JH: In the name of peace and sanity.

**This is my problem.** Ending the Time War is not a secret. Many people know he did that. 11 has often said how he killed all of the timelords. The main theory I read was that John Hurt started the Time War. This is probably the only thing that fits in my mind. Roughly though. Why would you need to *start* a war with the Daleks? Wouldn't they be all too willing? I mean, 10 and 11 spoke of the Time War with a sense of inevitability. It couldn't be avoided. That fits with John Hurt not being given a choice...but he could have just let the Daleks start it, (Or whatever).

This seems like a huge thing I can't get over.

He had murderous dudes with him.  Murder the bystanders!  Why not?  The guy waits forever, figures out this whole thing, sets an elaborate trap over space and time to track them all.  He even used them to threaten the Doctor.  Just do it again...BEFORE you jump in.  Hey, have two of them hold the doctor and force him to watch it. 

And regarding the changes he made: 

Jenny disappeared, Strax turned back around.  Vasta...was still positive.  That's weird, right?  I thought the backstory was simple: she awoke up in a subway, started murdering innocent humans, the Doctor did his thing.  Wouldn't that be considered one of his victories: turning her into a force for good?  Perhaps she should have turned around and killed Clara...as Clara is human.

I'm ignoring the idea of whether Clara should have been there, if the GI went back (because Vasta or Strax could have killed her, or even the murderous dudes!)

It comes back to why was the Intelligence so dumb?  That's too big of a thing for me and is really bothering me :(

edit: it was clear from Demon's Run that the Doctor had no shortage of allies or people willing to help him.  Even making the huge assumption that he could turn the allies against him (such as Strax)...so yes, WHY leave allies standing around?  Obviously they'd sacrifice themselves for him.  gah.

Several players were lost to injury for various times, some the whole season. Looking back at this season we should be proud.  
Now, to address the Arsenal invasion of our subreddit. They have a right to gloat, to an extent. They did edge us out for fourth during squeaky bum time, and rightfully so. We should've been easily in fourth, maybe even third, but we dropped points to Wigan, Fulham, and Liverpool towards the end of the season. Arsenal fans have dropped 800 upvotes on a single post and a ton more on comments in the span of a few hours. They've invaded our sub, but who cares? They're putting comments on a page that has Bale on top, our logo to right, and a quote from our most famous manager below that. Anytime they post something on this sub they have to stare at Spurs stuff for quite some time. Plus, their own keeper said ""We celebrated a bit like we had won the Championship, which was a bit weird.""  
So, don't even pay attention to the Arsenal fans. Just let them have their fun and return to /r/gunners. We've got a huge offseason coming up, let's focus on that.

I was under the impression that Moffat intentionally wrote her exit the way he did so that we would know she was coming back. In River and the Doctor's kiss scene I initially thought that they were saying goodbye forever, only River couldn't really let The Doctor go unless he said goodbye in a way that made it seem like he was coming back. However, I think that this was just to deliver a false conclusion about River so we would be surprised by the next few lines which deliver the idea that River is coming back. They go like so.

River: Oh, and one more thing.

Doctor: Isn't there always?

River: I was mentally linked with Clara. If she's really dead, how can I still be here?

Doctor: Ok, how?

So, how do we figure out how River was still there if she doesn't come back? Usually ""spolers"" signifies that there is more to a story. I don't think River's is done being told.

If anybody could help lend some evidence to this theory or anything to the contrary that would be great.

Now on to John Hurt as the Doctor. I know that a lot of people are thinking that he is the real Ninth Doctor and is the one who ended the Time War which caused him to be somewhat disowned by the subsequent regenerations. However I think that it is an amalgam of the Eighth and Ninth and is something like the Dream Lord or Valeyard (which I'm not fully aware of who he is other than he is some form of the Doctor or something like that) or that he is a manifestation of the Doctor's bad side from the Time War. I don't know how that could figure into the 50th just yet but I think it's an interesting take on how exactly he fits in.

Now, normally I'd be against breaking the wage structure, because we usually can't afford it, but world class players like Bale don't come through your ranks too often and it's vital you keep the best player in the league when he's there.

Levy is a very smart businessman, and this has resulted in both the best and worst parts of his ownership (mostly best, I firmly believe he's the greatest chairman in the league). He knows that the money we'll get next year from sponsorship (BT have Bale as their face for their coverage) and TV rights will more than cover the £170k a week. He knows that all the people coming from around the world to see the great Gareth perform his magic will pump money into our club. Players will want to play alongside him. And most importantly of all, he wins us games. 

Plus, it seems like Gareth wants to stay. I know that's an easy trap to fall into, but he seems to have built up a repor with Andre, and it'd be nice for him to honour that for another year. 

It makes far, far more sense to Levy to pay Bale £170k a week than sell him to United for £60m. Far more. Putting my money where my mouth is - Gareth is staying.

This could explain why the TARDIS is the biggest monument there. Maybe that's why the Doctor didn't want to go there.

I've never been able to really 'get in' to this show.

My girlfriend says its because I am to picky with my story and that sometimes I just need to with-hold my suspension of belief when watching Doctor Who.

I've watched approximately eight episodes when they are on with her, statue angels, forget-me creatures, mermaid marking swords, doctor who robots, some creatures on a planet in a black hole called ""the oooooooooood"", etc. 

I've just never really been able to sit there and watch this show try to explain itself. 
Almost every episode I've seen there is always a plot device blaring out in the open. ""Oh the tardis disappeared because the ship was there and two things can't exist in the same place at the same time"", ""the doctor **had** to die but he didn't and now everything is okay time is normal now"", ""the angels don't like to be looked at, oh but now they don't have to be statues to suck you back they can be in screens, why don't I turn it off"" etc. 

I also can't seem to get past the scientific explanations the show uses. A science-fiction show should have stellar explanations and every time they come up ""meh, it's timey wimey fruit loop space illogic"" or ""I'm an alien, we are different."" seems to be about the extent of the science in this science fiction show.

The theories I have heard thus far are that John Hurt is 8.5 or 13.  I think they make a lot of sense in relation to the show, but I don't think they would work due to real-life constrictions.  The 8.5 theory makes way more sense but I can't help but think it's too easy.  Generally I think Moffat has more up his sleeves then handing something to the audience like that.  I like the theory of the 13 or future regen because it's a different layer of timey wimey, but it would cause casting trouble in the future.

My thoughts are this: what happened before the first episode of Doctor Who?  Again, I don't know classic Doctor so correct me if I am wrong here.

Maybe John Hurt is a younger version of the first Doctor?  From what I've been reading online, he could be The Other from before the first Doctor.

I'm kind of looking for a club to get behind and I figure my time in Aston is reason enough to follow Villa.  I have a couple of questions for you if you don't mind.  I realize that Villa is a perennial underdog and I am used to that concept.

* Why do you chose to support Villa?

* Is Villa always on the cusp of relegation as it was this year?

* Does it bother you at all that West Ham has the same kit?  I mean if you are walking down the street wearing claret and blue, do people have to ask which club you support?

* Tell me a story that sums up your experience as a Villan.

Cheers.

it came from Doctor Simian:  ""...will be known by many names...the Valeyard...""

ill repeat it.   THE MOTHER EFFING VALEYARD.  a lot of people thought Moffat was just going to skip that little bit of canon, but right there he just fully acknowledged it.  The Doctor will be known as the Valeyard at some point, and since we're following canon now, it should be VERY Soon (12-13th regeneration). This adds up to something very intriguing and, to my mind, much more important than any lost incarnations of the Doctor.  This means that at some point The Doctor will cease to be the Doctor altogether, take up living with and working with the TimeLords again (which means that the time lock will be opened and Gallifrey restored), and that he will be responsible for a litany of atrocities.  what's more, the Doctors actions during the Time War finally explains exactly why the Time Lords felt the Doctor needed to be put on trial in the first place, and who better to judge him than a more sober, elder version of himself.  

that one little statement from Simian sets thr stage for the next 5 or 6 years of Doctor Who.  why are we not talking about this at all??

Just wanted to pop by to say a few things.

1. I have been tracking all 3 teams statistically over the season and all 3 teams have done extremely well. Chelsea is best improved over last season and managed to go third with the worst schedule. Arsenal pulled a magical 26/30 run to catch up when everyone said they couldn't. Resilience and belief under pressure. All with the core of the team completely overhauled and still gelling. Tottenham went and took home their record points tally. They did it by having a better record (than Arsenal) against the top teams. You guys have many last gasp wins with goals in the final 10 minutes to be proud of. Tottenham usually collapses at the end of the season. You guys didn't this season. This is a big plus for you. This gives the team belief.

2. Arsenal fans understand your pain. It is a different kind of pain but one that stems from the same root. Injuries, losing top players, needing a team to gel, facing media and rival fans rubbing salt on your wounds, questioning quality and consistency of the team. The list goes on. The reason why some Arsenal fans are over the top today / yesterday is because we know we narrowly made it against the odds. Frankly, you guys did too and deserve to celebrate. Like Theo said, it's 'a shame' to grab 72 points and not qualify but the competition has been insane with all 3 teams going strong at the end.

Chin up. The season is over. All three teams have plenty to be proud off. Don't let the media and rival fans get you down. Arsenal fans had to deal with that all season and you might have to deal with that in the summer lull.

Whatever the banter and the rivalry, the race is over this season and it was too darned close to say which team is better. It is a sport in the end and only appropriate for proper fans to recognize what their rivals have done.

I don't like Tottenham but I'll be a fool to not recognize the improvements your team has made. Here's to a strong competition again next season.

It seems that there is almost universal consensus about the John Hurt Doctor that appears at the end of the finale. The assumption that he is Doctor 8.5, that he doesn't get the Doctor name because of atrocities he has committed, that his actions to end the Last Time War were the cause of his downfall, etc. And I can see all of the points being right and, in fact, most of them seem the best answer, except for one. While his 8.5-ness is indicated by the actions of 9 and by his mix of 8 and 9s' clothing and his disgrace is made clear by 11's description of him, the assertion that his terrible actions were his actions ending the Last Time War are purely conjecture. There's no hard evidence like his attire or 11's description, just the knowledge that this was a devastating and traumatic event for the Doctor. Now, I'll admit that this notion holds a strong appeal to me because it is entirely plausible and because every Whovian would love to hear that story, but another equally plausible theory occurred to me and I'd like to run it past my fellow Whovians here.

In the second to last episode of the season, Nightmare in Silver, there is a scene where Clara and the Emperor/Porridge are strolling along Hedgewicks' World and the Emperor is lamenting the horrors of the Cyber Wars and points up to a void in the stars where the entire Tiberian Spiral galaxy was destroyed as something of a final solution to destroy the Cybermen and end the Cyber Wars. The scene goes as follows:
&gt;
&gt;PORRIDGE: Yeah. I feel like a monster sometimes. 
&gt;
&gt;CLARA: Why? 
&gt;
&gt;PORRIDGE: Because instead of mourning a billion trillion dead people, I just feel sorry for the poor blighter who had to press the button and blow it all up. 

Then the camera immediately cuts to the Doctor, looking somewhat like a kid who just got caught with his hand in the cookie jar, and he looks up and asks Clara if she gave Angie permission to go to the barracks. The episode goes on from there, but I remember being immediately struck by the scene with the notion that it was the Doctor who destroyed the Tiberian Spiral galaxy in order to defeat the Cybermen and that the Emperor was unknowingly pitying the Doctor for having to do so. It all seemed so casual though so I had to go back and try to find out if it was already canon that the Doctor was the ultimate end to the Cybermen. However, I couldn't find anything of the sort. Now, with all this conjecture about what this great evil the Doctor committed to create this fractured, broken, non-Doctor, it occurs to me that perhaps it was the destruction of that entire galaxy to end the Cyber Wars to save humanity and the rest of the galaxy. Granted it could still be the Last Great Time War, but this is just as plausible and I feel it fits more eloquently into the season. Obviously, both wars would have been ended in the name of peace, but I feel like the ending of the Cyber Wars also fit more into being done in the name of sanity due to the infinite escalation the Emperor refers to, as well as because of the seemingly illogical combination of the original Mondan Cybermen with Pete's World Cybermen that resulted in the modern Cybermen seen since the 11th came into being. Granted that bit is also just conjecture, but I'm just pointing it out. Ultimately, I don't know that either theory is more valid than the other at this point, but I did want to offer this all up as another hypothesis that, to me at least, seems to fit just as well as the Time Wars hypothesis.

**TL;DR** Perhaps the great atrocity committed by the Doctor to create the John Hurt Doctor is not his ending of the Last Great Time War, but rather the destruction of the Tiberian Spiral Galaxy mention in the previous episode.",false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,null,null,self,Season Finale's Ending: An Alternate Hypothesis (SPOILERS),14,http://www.reddit.com/r/doctorwho/comments/1eo3a9/season_finales_ending_an_alternate_hypothesis/

But when he came to chelsea he was considered one of the best strikers in the world. While he was on a bad run of form, largely do to injuries and reduced pace, he was still a top player. When he came here he ""struggled."" 

If you look at it though, so did sturridge and now he's scoring a ton for liverpool. Ba was scoring for fun at newcastle and now that he's hear his goal-rate is down dramatically. In my opinion torres is a much superior player to demba ba, a proven striker in his own right. Our system isn't based on strikers really scoring that many goals. Droba exceeded 12 goals in only two season and outside of those two seasons he had 51 goals in 158 games. And that's the great Didier drogba. shevchenko was an insanely prolific scorer for milan before coming to chelsea and he didn't score much here either.

The truth is that in our system strikers normally don't score a lot, instead we've always had a midfield that contributed tons of goals. And there's nothing wrong with that. The strikers we have are pretty darn good and play quite well if you evaluate their perfomances on things other than scoring goals. Torres' link up play is great, he is fantastic at clearing headers, he wins the ball back pretty often and he wins a ton of corners. Ba gives us on option on long balls, he's good at holding the ball up and he creates space for the midfield with his runs.

Buying a striker isn't the answer imo. falcao, cavani, lewandowski. They're all bound to ""underperform"" if they come here. Torres, ba and lukaku is a great trio of attackers and finding games for the 3 of them may already be a challenge. Lukaku is certainly ready to play for us now and the sky is the limit for him /rant

* Also one for the future is [**Wilfried Bony**](http://www.clubcall.com/chelsea/chelsea-set-for-striker-talks-1592384.html?) Vitesse are after £19mil for the versatile youngster.

I noticed that even in the first episode, Doctor is mentioned as ""The Predator"" by Daleks (both sane and insane ones) more than once, which is a very spesific given title among the many others mentioned in the finale...Beast, Valeyard, Predator etc..and unlike our usual doctor, a Predator hunts and kills its prey like a beast, above the foodchain.

In the first episode only the Daleks in Asylum who survived 11th, recalls and names him ""Doc...torr""...Before Clara erases Doc from their database. (Clara is even more skilled in hacking then Doctor (he says he even couldnt do such feat), which is a hint of Clara merging with GI?)

IMO All these titles are given to JohnHurt, since even 11th Doc seems surprised when he first hears Daleks identifying him ""the Predator"" at s7e01, even Clara tells that Dalek database is filled with ""him"" as Predator just like the GI speaks of the titles in the last battlefield/grave.

In my opinion JohnHurt, whom a later regeneration of Mattsmith, is struck in a sacrifical dilemma and he chooses to break his promise to his name by going ""cold blood predator mode against //evil// races"" and start hunting them through time and space, which we see trails of it through nicknames in the series like breadcrumbs..

Again moffat is fiddlin with paradoxes heavyly :) 
But by entering/getting scattered in a complete timeline (birth to grave), I have no idea what to expect now..

Any ideas about JohnHurt aka Predator being the last Doc, whom made a final stand in the name of peace and sanity by breaking his ultimate promises?

&gt;To whom it may concern,

&gt;I am writing to advise you have the disgusting behaviour of some of your employees outside the [REDACTED] branch of Halfords on Sunday 19/05 2013 at closing time.

&gt;I had travelled back from work and had entered the car park where I observed several of your members of staff shutting the store up for the evening. I passed these employees and parked my car up by the [REDACTED], I then proceeded on foot to [REDACTED], at the set of traffic lights there I was then accosted by one of your employees vehicles passing by (a small black 'boy racer') and I observed one of your employees in his Halfords fleece shout abuse at me as they drove past to the effect of 'You Fucking Knobhead' among others

&gt;Now this was not an intentional spot of banter between the occupants of the vehicle but loudly shouted expletives in my direction.

&gt;This young idiot has sadly cast a negative image on your company from my point of view, I would have though anyone with half a brain cell would know not to hurl abuse at people when wearing corporate uniform that easily identifies who you work for, and especially not to someone who lives a stones throw from the store you work in.

&gt;Anyway I am pretty sure not much will be done to discipline the individual as they would simply deny it, or claim I tried to run them over in the car park or something equally ludicrous. I just thought I would let you know in writing that you should probably send a company memo to your employees reminding them that any negative action taken in their corporate uniforms would reflect very badly on the company and obviously highlights the intellectual limitations of the said employees.

""Toward the end of the Last Great Time War, the Eighth Doctor was imprisoned for over a month on an unknown planet with a Malmooth named Chantir. It turned out the Eighth Doctor had planned his imprisonment to infiltrate the prison and steal the Great Key when it arrived on a transport. After escaping with it, the Doctor noted the Great Key had been part of a weapon called the De-mat Gun, which could completely remove something from time and space.

 The Doctor said that he did fire the De-Mat gun he made at some point in the future, but its side-effect of memory erasure caused him to forget nearly all of his encounter with Chantir, among many other things.""

So that leads a big gap in the doctor's time stream which makes room for John Hurt's doctor. It could possibly involve the nightmare child and I believe Chantir is the key to John Hurt's doctor and that he was the great sacrifce; the reason why John Hurt's doctor is not ""The Doctor"" in the rest of his incarnation's eyes.

Also keep in mind that 10 is coming back for the 50th and he also referenced Chantir once.

Feel free to disagree and discuss, i love theorizing :)

I'm starting a postgrad degree and arranged to let a house through a letting agent. I signed the paperwork through the letting agent and paid them the first months rent in advance. I was advised the deposit would be taken from the first months standing order.

I was recently contacted by a third party property management agency at the behest of the landlord. They are demanding the deposit to be paid by cheque immediately and threatening that the property may not be made available to me in time for the start date of my tenancy due to the time it takes to process deposits. This sounds like bollocks to me - the contract says as long as payment is made before or on the 1st of july (tenancy start date) the tenancy starts immediately. 

I have informed them I am not happy to do this as it goes against everything I have agreed with the letting agent. The landlord now claims that the letting agent has overstepped their boundary and that they were instructed only to provide suitable tenants - after this the property management company were supposed to take over. He is insistent immediate payment is due. In addition, he wants new paperwork submitted to this new property management agency - paperwork i have already submitted to the estate agent. 

Has anybody got any advice? I really can't afford to stump up effectively an extra months rent two months early. The landlord seems to be very rude also. I feel like I should be able to point to the contract and say that there is no mention of what he's asking so he can get fucked. I'm documenting everything via email.

I've been watching some episodes of the Third Doctor for the first time, and I feel a remarkable similarity between him and Sherlock Holmes.

-He's an absolute genius and isn't afraid to brag about it.

-He acts grumpy and stuck-up at his friends (he particularly enjoys shouting at the Brigadier), but does care for them.

-Most of his episodes involve solving some sort of mystery going on at the time.

-He demands constant attention; According to Liz, he needs ""someone to pass him his test tubes and tell him how brilliant he is.""

-He has a military friend, a stalwart soldier who is always seen helping him in his missions; The Brigadier bears several remarkable resemblances to John Watson.

-He has a nemesis that is his intellectual equal and he is shown constantly fighting, The Master, possibly his Moriarty.

-He has a seemingly inexhaustable supply of knowledge on almost every subject including science, languages, and even martial arts.

I am job seeking, day in, day out, so I figure I might as well get some help. I wanted to ask these questions before I sign up as I'm worried how I'll be perceived if I ask at the job centre.

1. Work placements-  these 'work for tesco for free' things we've all heard about. I'm willing to give up my benefits if it means getting out of one of these. I disagree with them and from what the stats show they are a waste of time. How likely is it that I'll get put on one of these soon after signing on? 

2. I get a small allowance from my dad to help me while I'm unemployed. I want to replace that with the benefits as he can't really afford it either. Do I have to show them my bank account? What happens if I've had that income, or if I have ±£300 in there?

3. I live with my girlfriend who earns ±30k before tax, but she is leaving the country shortly and is paying off large student and personal loans so cannot support me. Is it easier to just say she is a house mate on the forms?

4. I can't find any info on how much housing benefit I'll get..does anyone know the maximum?

5. How does council tax work if one person in the flat is employed and the other isn't?

Whenever the topic seems to come up on reddit, a lot of comments are in favour of it, how it will positively change the world.

Whilst I can see the positives self-driving cars can bring, I can't help but think of the negatives it will introduce for us the UK.  Let's assume that busses will self-drive, taxi's (will still exist) will self drive, haulage will also self drive.

What would be the impact?

1) We're already in a situation of relatively high unemployment.  Could these existing drives re-train and do another job?  Or would they simply find themselves unable to find work?

2) Would it promote a greater wealth divide?  I.e. corporations would be able to operate their vehicles with lower running costs (lower staffing costs, less vehicle insurance) whilst more of the population would be jobless.

I think the positives would probably include an increase in business for pubs, as more people will be able to drink and not have to worry about being a designated driver.

I learned a few things from this:

- We lost *a lot* of games this season.

- We have a very optimistic subreddit (Except for maybe /u/Sgt_General!)

- Our sub has more than trebled in size since last September, we started the prediction league with just 11 players, and finished with 54! 

- I am not very good at predicting results.

And I'd like to bring up something that may or may not have before.

During Eccleston's, Tennant's, and later Smith's tenures more and more has been brought up with his fighting the Daleks, and the subsequent deaths of a LOT of innocent people and I noticed some things in their performances-especially Smith's that I see in friends of mine that have returned from military service and myself and some of my family in domestic service.
The *look* of such deep remorse and inner self loathing, the sudden verbal snapping at friends and love ones, to emotionally withdrawing or bottling yourself up and putting on a smiley face because its terrifying to think of anyone else knowing what you did. Or what you survived when others didn't. 

Another thing I've noticed is the joy the Doctor has in seeing his companions' wonders. As if hes living vicariously through them because hes so old and emotionally injured it might be the only joy he lets himself have besides wanting to fix the world's- *universe's* problems. I have a friend and a family member that were this way after their discharge. One coaches little league, and likes to sponsor barbecues and get togethers. All wonderful but when its just him he's a mess that hasn't had a full nights sleep since he got out.

I'm almost convinced that Smith at least has taken traumatic stress into account for the roll becase I see so much in the eyes and hear so much in the voice. Made me cry at least once.  Accident victims also sometimes have PTSD. Maybe Smith and/or Tennant knows firsthand or a friend or family member that talked about it.

**MATCH EVENTS**

The teams are out the tunnel! Here we go!

**0'** We're off! COYS

**18'** CLOSE! Kane beat his man, crossed for Obika whose effort hit the bar. 0-0

**20'** CLOSE! Ceballos does his best Bale impression, cutting in from the right, lashing a dipping shot with his left. Just over. 

**21'** CLOSE! United's Lingard beats our defence but his shot is right at Archer.

**22'** SO CLOSE! Kane's great effort hits the post.

**25'** Spurs captain Grant Hall is booked for a tackle on Januzaj.

**29' GOAL!!!** United to fail to clear a cross, Pritchard heads it down for Obika to sweep it in. 1-0

**32'** CLOSE! United free kick clears everyone and is nearly knocked in at the far post. Let off. 1-0

**33'** BOOKING. Nasty challenge by Bentaleb. Booked for it.

**34'** BOOKING. Lingard booked for a challenge on Ceballos. United commentator thinks it's because Ceballos is foreign.

**42' GOAL!!!** United gift away possession, Pritchard receives the ball, thumps it from 20 yards out into the bottom corner. Cracker! 2-0 Spurs

**45'+2 HT:** Manchester United 0-2 Tottenham Hotspur

Great first half performance. Two good goals and four more great efforts on goal. Looking good in possession and solid defensively.

**46'** We're back under way!

**58'** CLOSE! Two quick United efforts, Archer smothers up.

**60'** GOAL, Vermijl gives United a goal. 1-2 Spurs

**63'** TOTTENHAM SUB Pritchard **off** McAvoy **on**

**66'** BOOKING. United's Lawrence clatters Tom Carroll. Rightly booked. Carroll needs treatment.

**69'** CLOSE! Ceballos fires a swerving shot across goal. Neat save by United's Amos.

**73'** BOOKING United's Cole booked for a dive. Questionable...

**74'** GOAL. Cole equalises. 2-2

**76'** SO CLOSE! Obika nearly puts us straight back ahead. Put through, keeper comes out but his effort is skied wide. 2-2

**78'** CLOSE! Carroll's shot takes a deflection but United's Amos saves it comfortably. 2-2

**88'** GOAL! Heartbreak for young Spurs as Cole puts United ahead. 3-2 United

**90'** 4 added minutes to find an equaliser.

**90' +2** BOOKING. Cynical challenge from Carroll.

**FT Manchester United 3-2 Tottenham Hotspur**

Youth football is really just a bit of fun, but I'm gutted! Dominant in the first half, United came fighting back in the second half. And despite Spurs winning our initial group and the Elite Group, we don't lift the trophy! Hold your heads high, boys!       ",false,coys,t5_2ryq7,null,null,self,"Match Thread: Manchester United v.

* How do I apply for my national insurance number? I didn't recieve one at 16 as I wasn't living in the UK at the time.
* I have my full license in Canada (G class)- do I need to retake my drivers test in the UK?
* Is there anything else I need to know, before I move?

We were supposed to find out about the Doctor's biggest secret in this episode. WHO he is, that he's been running from ""all his life"". And in a way, we did. The Great Intelligence told us.

The Great Intelligence called the Doctor ""blood-soaked"". He said he killed 10 billion people at his final battle at Trenzalore. He said that was one of his more minor skirmishes. He said the Doctor will be known by other names in the future: ""The Storm. The Beast.""

This is the Doctor's biggest secret: he is the ultimate evil in the universe's future. He probably destroys the ENTIRE UNIVERSE in the future. That's what the Silence are trying to stop. That's why the militarized church is out to get him. That's why the Pandorica was built for him. To save the future of the universe.

But it's not his future. It's HIS PAST. That's the beauty of time travel. It already happened for him, in the past. That's **""the secret you've been running from ALL YOUR LIFE. Doctor Who?""** (Wedding) He is the destroyer of worlds. **""I was there when time ran out. Moment by moment until NOTHING remained. NO time. NO space. JUST ME.""** (Akhaten)

And his real name reflects that, whatever it is. That's who John Hurt is playing. The original him. BEFORE he CHOSE the name ""Doctor"". He destroyed the universe, perhaps he had no choice. But he escaped back into the past, regenerated into William Hartnell, and made a promise to himself. To be the Doctor. To be a healer. And he's been at it for 11 regenerations.

But what's done is done. The secret he's been running from all his life, is who he really, originally was. John Hurt's incarnation. The Destroyer of Worlds. The original evil.

Basically, he was the devil.

EDIT: The_Muensters pointed out that the Doctor tells a Dalek he's ""the devil himself"" in The Wedding of River Song. That's not the only time. It's been alluded to over and over in the last three seasons under Moffat. I've had this theory for over a year, and each episode just seems to confirm it to me again. Most recently, the GI in this episode called him ""the Cruel Tyrant, the Vessel of the Final Darkness, THE BEAST.""

My biggest question is of a possible relation between River and Clara. After what Clara did, she was continually reborn into the Doctor's timestream in order to save him, yeah? Is it possible that perhaps Amy's daughter, Melody, was one other incarnation of Clara? If you think about it, the only thing that made River Song different from any other human being is the fact that she was conceived on the Tardis.

On top of that, River Song continually saved the Doctor's life (ultimately ending her own), just as Clara set out to do. River Song knows the Doctor's name, and she mentioned in the latest episode that it was not his choice (or something to that effect) that she knew. Due to the fact that Clara retained her memories of the alternate timeline, she knows the Doctor's name by reading it in the book. The final piece of information that got the ball rolling on this possible theory for me was the fact that the telepathic link between Clara and River wasn't broken, and when the Doctor asked why, River replied with ""Spoilers"". Not to mention that River and Clara are both similar in their flirtations.

I dunno, maybe I'm just going crazy, but it was just something that came to mind after I finished watching the episode. I'd love to hear what other people think about this, and why or why not they think it's possible.

She sees all the Doctors, either in full or in part, with the exception of Ten and Eight. We know Ten is coming back, so what if John Hurt is Eight? 

It makes sense...Eight is presumed to have fought in the Time War, and he says he did what he did for peace and sanity. Sounds a lot like actions he took during the Time War. Not only that, but even after Eleven makes his speech about names being a promise and John Hurt broke that promise, they still call him the Doctor in the credits. 

There's also the fact that Eleven seems to sympathize with John Hurt's Doctor. He might be able to do it if that's a future version of the Doctor, but it seems more likely he's talking about something in the past. 

Granted, Clara says she knows The current Doctor is the Eleventh, which would imply she knows about the Eighth, but then again, Eight fought in the Time War, and the Doctor hates to talk about what happened then. What if he walled off that portion of himself? It'd also be a nice touch--Paul McGann starts as the Eighth Doctor, and fights in the Time War for centuries, becoming old and grizzled. He finally finishes the war, in the process betraying the one thing that meant the most to him--his name and his principles. Devastated, unable to call himself the Doctor anymore, he forces himself to regenerate, killing off this incarnation so he can become the Doctor again. From the Ninth Doctor on he carries that failure with him, becoming even more dedicated to his principles and the name of the Doctor.

No bullshit excuses, I was lazy. Didn't go to uni becuase I don't know what I want to do so don't want to get in debt for 3 years of partying.

Anyway, I've been receiving Jobseeker's Allowance on and off for quite some time. In that time, the Jobcentre have only *really* helped me twice: There was a course titled ""Suited, Booted, Recruited"", which - although cheesy sounding - actually had damn sound advice and really helped me, and more recently, they got me a work experience placement.

Now, this work experience turned out to be pretty good. It's only a 15 minute walk from where I live, the hours a great, the owners are great and so are the staff. A+ experience. The period officially ends on Wednesday, but 2 days ago I heard those magic words: ""We'd like to offer you a job"". Naturally, I was ecstatic.

However, I learned today that since I haven't been on Jobseekers for a certain amount of time, they won't help the company out with my wages, which means they can't afford to pay me for the minimum time and hours that Jobcentre themselves require them to give me if they offer me a job at the end of this placement.

Wat.

So basically, the owners were very apologetic (they had no idea about this), but it boils down to this: I can either quit Jobseekers and work for them on a 0-hour contract and get laid off come October due to lack of business, or I can work another 8 or 9 weeks unpaid so they can afford to pay me for a minimum 6 months at a minimum of 16 hours/week.

I struggle to see how this policy benefits anyone. I'm certainly not being helped as I'm being forced to jump though the JobCentre's bullshit hoops despite the fact I'm guaranteed a job. The people employing me aren't being helped as if they can't afford to hire me they've got to hire young people for holiday work (I started learning today how to shut up shop, they told me themselves they'd never let some holiday temp do that so they can never have a day off at the same time), and the government aren't benefiting from this as they have to continue to pay me Jobseekers.

I have no idea what to do now. I like the idea of being in a more secure job but but I'd be working more than 16 hours during the Summer and being paid for that sure would be dandy.

The Doctor will have reasoned this out too but won't know exactly what the event is and hopes to find a resolution and so opposes his future self. Alternately he never loses to himself as The Master but the Master has to try anyway, since he IS The Doctor and The Doctor never gives up.

OK, so I've long found that River has been the linchpin to a lot of what Moffat's done since taking over as showrunner. I'm very heavily invested in how they complete her story. What I was wondering from the much more knowledgeable Whovians, is was this supposed to be OUR final goodbye to River in the most recent episode? I've always dreamed Moffat would end Kingston's run with the trip to the Singing Towers of Derilium where the Doctor, with his nice new haircut, gives her the sonic which would later ""save"" her. But, while the Doctor avoids saying goodbye forever, this episode made it seem quite final. Is this just the last time River will ever see the Doctor since this takes place post-library? Do you think Moffat would end Kingston's run here or actually take us to their last meeting before River goes on to meet Tennant's Doctor?

In the recent finale, when The Great Intelligence is listing The Doctor's old enemies as examples to how blood-soaked he is, he mentions ""the sycorax, Solomon the Traitor, the cybermen, and the daleks"".  I've seen it mentioned on the wiki page that Solomon refers to the hunter in the dinosaurs episode, and it's been pointed out to me that he says, ""Solomon the Trader"", but I thought it was a reference to Solomon from [The Stranger](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Stranger_%28video_series%29), and I gotta say I flipped out in excitement.  Such a small line would carry such huge implications.  I've been told there's a fan theory that The Stranger could be considered a parallel world to Doctor Who, which makes a ton of sense considering its cast, and if this was a reference to it, it would not only make that canon but also imply that there was a crossover off-screen at some point in the past, before other-dimensional travel was sealed off.

Moffat has, in a very subtle and BRILLIANT way, included a theme in his seasons comparing the Doctor to the devil. There are some VERY overt references to it as the show progresses, but also lots and lots of more subtle references. With all the evidence I’m about to show you, it has to be intentional.

I’ll start with the subtle comparisons. One thing Steven Moffat has loved to do is show how the Doctor is like the monsters in his stories. Over and over we see episodes where the ancient lonely monster is compared to the Doctor at the end of the episode. This all started with a line Moffat wrote in Season 2’s The Girl in the Fireplace: *“The Doctor and the monsters. It seems you cannot have one without the other.”* Ever since Moffat took over the show, he’s taken that idea and ran with it.

1. **The Beast Below(s5e2) –** *“This dream must end, the world must know, we all depend on the Beast Below.”* The poem is directly about the Starwhale, but it is also DEFINITELY about the Doctor.  Because as we see in the episode, the Starwhale is incredibly ancient, the last of his kind, and only interferes with the planet *“when children are crying”*. Moffat intentionally wrote the Starwhale to mirror the Doctor, so when the final poem is read by Amy as the episode fades out, we are supposed to apply it to the Doctor. This is the first moment in Moffat’s writing where he uses a word synonymous with the devil: the Beast. Right there in his second episode as show-runner. That word will come back.

2. **The God Complex(s6e11) –** A false beast is worshiped in this episode. At the end of the episode as it is dying, this beast says *“An ancient creature, drenched in the blood of the innocents. Drifting in space through an endless shifting maze. For such a creature, death would be a gift.”* He then says *“I wasn’t talking about myself.”* He was talking about the Doctor. The Doctor is intentionally compared to this beast.

3. **Asylum of the Daleks(s7e1) –** This one is less so, but the Daleks call the Doctor “The Predator”. Of course he is, to them. But there is one line intentionally comparing the Doctor to the Daleks. He says *“You find hatred beautiful?”* And the Daleks reply *“perhaps that is why we have never been able to kill you.”*

4. **A Town Called Mercy(s7e3) –** We’re starting to kick it up a notch. *“When I was a child, my favorite story was about a man who lived forever, but whose eyes were heavy with the weight of all he had seen. A man who FELL FROM THE STARS.”* Of course, this man isn’t the Doctor, instead it’s the cyborg that is willing to destroy the whole town for his revenge. But he’s intentionally described in the vein of the Doctor. At the end of the episode, this is said: *“They’ve got their own angel watching out for them. Their very own angel who fell from the stars.”* Throughout the episode we’ve seen the similarities between the Doctor and the cyborg, so, just like in the Beast Below, the ending monlogue has two meanings. And notice that phrase again: “angel who fell from the stars.” An angel who fell from heaven. This is the way the devil is described in ancient mythology. It mirrors **Luke 10:18: “I saw Satan fall like lightning from heaven...”**

5. **The Rings of Akhaten(s7e6) –** The old god is worshiped by the people of Akhaten. But it turns out he’s more of a devil than a god. He’s a terrible fire demanding child sacrifice and threatening to consume everything. *“Oh you like to think you're a god. But you're not a god. You're just a parasite. Eaten out with jealousy and envy and longing for the lives of others. You feed on them. On the memory of love and loss and birth and death and joy and sorrow.”* This monster, a terrible god, mirrors the Doctor. In fact, in the episode the people call him Grandfather, and the Doctor mentions to Clara that he had a granddaughter. This is to intentionally show us that the Doctor and the monster are the same, once again.

6. **Hide(s7e8) –** The monster in this episode is once again overtly compared to the Doctor. *“Every lonely monster needs a companion,”* he says at the end. He’s talking about  himself and Clara. Both he and the monster were running across all of time to find their companion. Since this is intentional, anything said about the monster in this episode thematically applies to the Doctor. And there is a significant reference to the devil. The Doctor says to the monster: *“You hide, SEEKING WHOM YOU MAY DEVOUR.”* This is ripped directly from **1 Peter 5:8, “the devil walks around like a roaring lion, seeking whom he may devour.”**

7. **The Crimson Horror(s7e10) –** The Doctor is introduced as *“my monster”*. He is the monster in the episode, in direct opposition to the “religious” Mrs. Gillyflower. More on this in a second.

That’s it for monster-Doctor comparisons pertaining to the devil. Notice how they became much more frequent in Season 7, probably because Moffat told the other writers what was up.

Now for the direct mentions of the word “devil”. Is it a coincidence that every single time that word is put in a script it refers to the Doctor?

1. **The Wedding of River Song(s6e13)  –** This is the quote that started my theory. Even though it was hinted throughout Seasons 5 and 6, it was only after this episode aired that I realized what Moffat was doing. *“Imagine you were dying, and in terrible pain. And just when you think it couldn’t get any worse, you look up and see the face of* **THE DEVIL HIMSELF**.” Now, this is the Doctor speaking to a dying Dalek. It’s a clever quote, because it’s describing himself AND the Dalek. But it’s definitely describing himself. He calls himself the devil.

2. **Hide(s7e8) –** We’ve already been over how the Doctor was compared to the monster, who was compared to the devil. But there’s a more overt reference. *“The presence was accompanied by a dreadful knocking, as if* **THE DEVIL HIMSELF** *demanded entry.”* Now, again, this is about the ghost in the house. But the Doctor’s entrance to this episode is loud knocking that exactly matches the knocking the “ghost” does later. He demands entry. That’s on purpose.

3. **The Crimson Horror(s7e10) –** A bit of a throw-away line, but since the writers all know what’s up, it is definitely there on purpose. Again, Mrs. Gillyflower’s nemesis in this episode is the Doctor. He is the one she needs to avoid to acheive her plan. In one scene she spills the salt, then throws some over her shoulder and says *“to keep* **THE DEVIL** *at bay.”* Clever writing.

4. **Nightmare in Silver(s7e11) –** Another clever throw-away, but can’t be ignored given the sheer amount of these references. The cyberplanner talking to Clara says, *“He knows who you are. Oh, he hasn’t told you?* **SLY DEVIL** *”* and is immediately cut off by the Doctor taking back control of the body.

That’s it for actual mentions of the word “devil”. Again, much more prevalent in Season 7 leading up to the reveals that Moffat’s promised us.

Now let’s see the other names of the Doctor throughout Moffat’s Who. You might be surprised how often they are synonymous with a devil.

1. **The Pandorica Opens(s5e12) –** *“There was a goblin, or a trickster. Or a warrior. A nameless, terrible thing, soaked in the blood of a billion galaxies. The most feared being in all the cosmos. And nothing could stop it, or hold it, or reason with it. One day it would just drop out of the sky and tear down your world.”* Turns out it’s the Doctor.

2. **A Good Man Goes to War(s6e7) –** *“The Man Who Lies.”* Also called this in many other episodes.

3. **The Name of the Doctor(s7e13) –** Even though I had my theory over a year ago, this episode basically confirms it. *“Welcome to the final resting place of the Cruel Tyrant. The Slaughterer of the Ten Billion. The Vessel of the Final Darkness... he will have other names before the end. The Storm. The Beast.”*

Are there other things in the episodes, besides names or monsters, that support this theory? Why yes!

1. Rule One: the Doctor lies. This has only been “Rule One” since Moffat took over. Because it fits his grand scheme. The devil is the father of all lies. This rule is usually quoted flippantly by either the Doctor or River, but in The Name of the Doctor when he promises Clara *“this won’t hurt a bit”* and then it does, he looks her dead in the face and gravely spits out: *“I lied.”*

2. The Doctor has a militarized CHURCH trying to bring him down for the good of the universe.

3. If you’ve been running your whole life from the fact that you’re the devil, would you have guilt? Absolutely.  In **Amy’s Choice(s5e7)** he tells the Dream Lord (who is himself): *“There’s only one person in the universe who hates me as much as you do.”* Hint, it’s himself.

4. Similarly, in **The God Complex(s6e11)**, he opens the door of his room to find his most feared thing. *“Of course. WHO else?”* He’s seen himself (probably the John Hurt version, which I’ll get to in a minute).

5. And here’s **my favorite** little Moffatism. River Song, the Doctor’s one true pair, says the phrase *“Let there be light”*, a phrase attributed to God, in two separate episodes. Once in The Big Bang. And once in Forest of the Dead, her very first episode!

Now how does this nicely tie up in the most recent episode, with the John Hurt reveal? Because the devil is WHO the Doctor is. It’s the answer to the question. It can be summed up by his name, a unique name, which he eventually tells to River, and which he dropped in favor of “the Doctor”. For instance, it could be summed up in the name Satan, or Beelzebub, although I doubt the name will ever be said out loud to the audience. **The point of the question is not THE NAME, but WHO HE REALLY IS.**

 John Hurt’s Doctor, then, is most likely the original Doctor, before he took the name of Doctor. He did something so awful, so incredibly terrible in the universe’s future (his past) that he was the most destructive and evil force in all the universe. I think John Hurt’s Doctor destroyed the universe. *“I watched creations freeze and burn. I was there when time ran out. Moment by moment until nothing remained. NO time. NO space. JUST ME.”* **(Rings of Akhaten)**

He somehow escaped into the past and regenerated into the first Doctor. He then took the name of Doctor, and ran from his past, vowing to be a healer from that point on. *“I said he was me. I never said he was the Doctor. My name, my real name, that is not the point. The name I chose is the Doctor. The name you choose, it’s like a promise you make. He is my secret.”* **(Name of the Doctor)**

He has been running from his terrible past ever since he took the name Doctor. *“The oldest question in the universe. The question that must never be answered! Hidden in plain sight! The question you’ve been running from ALL YOUR LIFE! Doctor Who? Doctor WHO? DOC TOR WHO?”* **(Wedding of River Song)**

*“Doctor who? It’s more than just a secret, isn’t it.”* **(Girl in the Fireplace)** Yes, it’s more than JUST a secret. It’s a man. The past version of himself. John Hurt’s version. The devil.

He’s running from his terrible past, but he can’t escape it. He’s a good man now, but he can’t undo what he did. Despite all his best intentions, nothing can make up for what he’s done. And he always lets his companions down. He tells Amy she CAN’T have faith in him, because he can’t save her. He tries, but he can’t. He is the most terrible being that has ever lived.

Fitting that he ends up buried on a fiery graveyard planet that looks [*suspiciously like hell.*](http://redrocketrising.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Trenzalore.jpg)",false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,null,null,self,Thematic allusions between the Doctor and the devil in Moffat's Who (I could teach a college course) [INCLUDES FINALE SPOILERS],288,http://www.reddit.com/r/doctorwho/comments/1eq0lm/thematic_allusions_between_the_doctor_and_the/

While inside his tomb, the Doctor states that the light his essentially his timeline from when he first began time travelling, to when he arrived at Trenzalore. Meaning the only things contained inside of it are moments when he was travelling in time.

As the opening of the episode showed us, the Doctor stole the TARDIS as ""The 1st Doctor"" aka Hartnell. Meaning when he started time travelling, he was what we know as the 1st Doctor. This means if John Hurt had come before Hartnell, we would not have been able to see him in the ""Time travel time line"" as he would have regenerated into Hartnell before ever travelling time.

Another thing is that, he says “I said he was me. I never said he was the Doctor. My name, my real name, that is not the point. The name I chose is the Doctor. The name you choose, it’s like a promise you make. He's the one that broke that promise” Meaning, the promise was made before John Hurt's Doctor came to be. If Hurt's personality/choices apparently contradict the promise that was made, Hurt wouldn't have made it in the first place, and if Hurt did whatever ""had to do in the name of peace"", then regenerated into Hartnell who made the ""Doctor"" promise, then technically he didn't break any promises at all, and Smith wouldn't have said that.

If I am missing something, please let me know. Otherwise I believe this nullifies the ""0th Doctor"" theory.

Whatever happens, Moffat won't kill off the entire series. But, The Doctor has to die (the tomb in the TARDIS clearly contained him). But why would it have to be Matt?

My theory is that instead of Matt dying, it is Tennant that dies in the 50th on the Fields of Trenzalor at the end of the battle. Since The Doctor who will be in the 50th might simply be the meta-crisis Doctor (part Time Lord) he likely could not regenerate. So, if in battle he is killed, the Doctor will die.

We do know (from previous pictures) that Tennant's TARDIS will be in 50th. However, it is the TARDIS with the broken window that contains the tomb. This could mean that Matt and David arrive separately, but while in battle, David is killed while aboard Matt's TARDIS. (Maybe to save Matt and Rose?)

Matt then would take David's TARDIS in order to continue. How the TARDIS would react would be interesting, I figure she would somehow transfer herself over to the other TARDIS. The role of Malpractice (Hurt) in all this would be interesting to see. It might possibly  be that he is the one who takes them there, to battle with the Doctor's allies.",false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,null,null,default,[Spoilers] Who's in the tomb?,0,http://www.reddit.com/r/doctorwho/comments/1eq90i/spoilers_whos_in_the_tomb/

Right now I'm hearing a lot about John Hurt's ""Identity"" as either the 0th or ""true"" 9th Doctor. The argument for the 0th is that John Hurt is the ""secret"" The Doctor has been running from his entire life (so it would only make sense that he occured before he started running). However, there are also theories abound that he was involved in the Time War. The issue with that is that the time war was never a secret, and this is supposedly worse than the time war. Here's where we get wibbly, stay with me while we go wobbly.

They're both correct. Time is cyclical (wibbly wobbly nonsense as we've learned) and happens all at the same time. We know the Doctor is old, but why must we assume that the 1st ""Doctor"" is his first, or even second regeneration? If we believe time is cyclical, than this means that the Time War (before the lock happened) is/was/will be happening at the exact same (relative) time as the Eleventh doctor's adventures. The tenth, ninths, and so on and so on. What does this tell us?

It's perfectly plausible that John Hurt was a soldier in the time war. Yes this involves crossing his own timeline, but he's done this before. Now, say this is true. That would create a very large paradox yes? What happened the last time we had one that big? End of Season 5, end of the Universe itself. 

John Hurt being in the Time War alongside the 8th Doctor caused the end of the Universe due to the paradox.

Now, he sees the Universe end. Sees all of time stop and everything cease to be except himself (I believe there is quite a good quote about him seeing the end of the universe in S7.E7? The Rings one) He realizes this and what it means. So he fixes the problem. 

He eliminates the 8th Doctor.

Now, we have a couple connections to make here. One, we finally learn how the 8th Doctor dies. Two, we see that John Hurt breaks (possibly) his own personal rule of never killing. Killing himself and seeing what the 8th Doctor (the warrior or the Time War, the one who activates the moment) is capable of, Hurt decides to never become this man, to become a ""Doctor"" and be a healer, never that killer. He hopes that he has avoided the paradox and runs from his inevitable fate. He then regenerates (it's been stated a Time Lord can do it at whim, not merely at death) and runs away. Runs his entire life from this.

Now we get to the 8th Doctor, he realizes who he has become and ends up back in the Time War. Now things are different, time can be changed. He knows his past (Hurt) is going to kill him. He knows that if he doesn't die, the universe will end. This is where the moment comes in. The Doctor, in his last breath (after Hurt delivers the supposed final blow that would for plot reasons deny him regeneration), uses the moment to save his life and lock the time war. Lock it away so that it can never, ever happen. If the Timewar doesn't happen, then he can't die, the universe won't end, and John Hurt becomes nothing more than a secret locked away in a war that was never supposed to happen.

And now we get to some more fancy things. How his name being revealed will cause the end of the world. I want to reference Rory. In his last episode, he looked at his grave and suddenly his death became a fixed point in time. It HAD to happen. His acknowledgement and knowledge of this caused the events to transpire. Perhaps the Doctor is running from John Hurt because if he ever reveals who he was, if he ever acknowledges what truly happened, then the timelock will break, the war will erupt, and the Doctor will have a decision to make. One he will have no choice in.

Allow the universe to be destroyed, or allow John Hurt to break the promise his future self made, the one never to kill, and allow Hurt to kill him and run from his past, thus starting the entire life of the Doctor. Wibbly Wobbly, Timey Wimey.

If you've seen the beginning of ""The Nightmare in Silver,"" try reading section I of Benjamin's ""On the concept of History"" - I don't think this can be a coincidence, but I don't know what it means:
""It is well-known that an automaton once existed, which was so constructed that it could counter any move of a chess-player with a counter-move, and thereby assure itself of victory in the match. A puppet in Turkish attire, water-pipe in mouth, sat before the chessboard, which rested on a broad table. Through a system of mirrors, the illusion was created that this table was transparent from all sides. In truth, a hunchbacked dwarf who was a master chess-player sat inside, controlling the hands of the puppet with strings. One can envision a corresponding object to this apparatus in philosophy. The puppet called “historical materialism” is always supposed to win. It can do this with no further ado against any opponent, so long as it employs the services of theology, which as everyone knows is small and ugly and must be kept out of sight.""

So it seems everyone is trying to guess who the John Hurt Doctor is and where he fits in. I havent seen this posted elsewhere so i thought I'd share. I propose the John Hurt doctor is actually the Meta Crisis Doctor in old age.

If you look at the reveal, the 11th Doctor said he's the only one to not keep the promise of being the ""Doctor,"" implying some horrible act that runs opposite to that name. So with that in mind:

* The Meta Crisis Doctor ages like a normal human

* If the Meta Crisis Doctor is the John Hurt Doctor, it would explain why Clara did not visit him. He's not an incarnation of the time lord Doctor, and possibly in an alternate dimension for most of his life.

* The Meta Crisis Doctor was exiled by the 10th Doctor for genocide against the Daleks, something that he was forced to do because it was in the name of peace and sanity (but not in the name of the Doctor).

* The 10th Doctor was quick to point out that his new double was born in battle, full of blood, anger and revenge.

* The Meta Crisis Doctor had the same memories, thoughts and feelings of the original Doctor up to the point of his aborted regeneration, making them essentially the same man with physiological differences. This could explain why he would still show up in the real Doctor's grave.

* The Meta Crisis Doctor was exiled to be with Rose, who's character returns in the 50th anniversary special.

* There are some pretty striking similarities between John Hurt and David Tennant if you think about it. They have similar higher pitched voices, with Tennant's take on the Doctor youthful and fun, Hurt's (small) performance from the finale old and stoic, like an angel cast out of heaven.

Also, compare how a young John Hurt looks and how David Tennant's doctor looks:

What's to say that this isn't actually the future, and the doctor who broke the promise hasn't happened yet.

This is where the 50th anniversary comes in.

If this is the time war we are finally headed to, why does David Tennant need to come back or Rose for that matter? Which regeneration is John Hurt's The Doctor? Or is he a regeneration at all.....? Why not the Doctor Donna? Perhaps somehow, the cybermen of the other universe make it back to this one. Obviously this brings the Doctor Donna back to our universe and Rose perhaps. Let's just say the 11th, Doctor Donna, Rose, and the Impossible Girl....do battle with the cybermen and somehow....just somehow, end up in the time war lock. Somehow Rose dies, causing an aging Doctor Dona to seek revenge on the two parties responsible. The Daleks and Time Lords. Effectively causing some kind of awesome deus ex machina only the Doctor Donna can perform because of who he is, to which surprisingly the Doctor Donna is the one who gives Rasillion the idea of Ultimate Sanction, which is basically the timelords becoming only consciousness and reality itself being destroyed. Time as well. But the 11th and the Impossible girl help the 8th Doctor somehow with the idea of possessing and using ""The moment"" to effectively save the universe from the doctor's donna's rage of losing Rose Tyler....his bad wolf.

And if you're saying, oh this can't make sense, the Doctor would remember.... What about River Song? She has visited ALL of The Doctor's incarnations, with the help of a memory erasing gas. What's to say David Tennant's Doctor Donna clone isn't the one who slipped some advice to Rasillion about destroying the universe and becoming only consciousness, just for petty half-human revenge against the Dalek's and Timelord's for causing Rose's death.",false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,null,null,self,A few questions about the finale....,1,http://www.reddit.com/r/doctorwho/comments/1eqqlh/a_few_questions_about_the_finale/

so a big part of the show will take part within the doctors timeline it is his future and past and by the end he somehow gets out of the time-tree eternal flame thing and tries to take off but re-crashes where they (doc+tardis) eventually die during some crazy war that started by breaking the cardinal rule of time travel (not knowing where,why,how,when you die as well as not changing fixed points in time or personal regrets, making him the doctor which didn't live up to the title).  

while he is in the eternal time flame, he looses his mind and becomes the ""Hurt Doctor"" which is the time war doc's hijack incarnation of being(since he now knows everything even though he was not suppose to) where he proceeds to do some nasty war-crime stuff breaks every major time-traveler convention, and regens as eccleston but before he does he gets river to steal a new tardis before he time-locks gallifrey.

Would love to hear whether /r/coys just thinks I'm deluded and ridiculously optimistic, or whether I've got a point. Submitting as self-post and copy and pasting the article below because this isn't for karma or hits.
-----------------------------------------

Finishing 5th is a detail. An incredibly demoralising detail, a detail that mean Spurs miss out on the obvious benefits of Champions League qualification, a detail that could so easily have been different, but still, just a detail. 

72 points, a record for Tottenham in the Premier League, is the statistic of true importance. And it's a statistic that fills me with optimism. 

If, for AVB, this season was about proving he was still the prodigious manager that led Porto to their record-breaking 2010/11 season and that he was more a victim, than a creator, of circumstances in his time at Chelsea, then he did that. In fact, one of his great achievements this season was in overcoming the xenophobic, agenda-driven media image that had once threatened to destroy his career as a manager in England. 

His first season at Tottenham was ultimately one of transition. Transition to an era where methodology, tactics, training sessions, science and consistent transfer policy are more than just words the manager can't spell. AVB lost key players early on (King, Modric, VdV), didn't have a new striker signed until August 23rd, allegedly didn't sign his key transfer target (Moutinho) or another striker, had to integrate several new signings in a very short time, lost Kaboul to injury for the full season, had to juggled two keepers expecting first team football for a couple of months, lost Sandro to injury mid-season and had to adapt to managing a new football club...

...yet still achieved a record points tally. 

Upon joining Spurs he spoke of their ""high ambitions towards the future"" and his ""mission to put Tottenham back on track with titles"". Many claimed it was empty rhetoric at the time but this season has gone a long way to proving that it wasn't. And I firmly believe that next season will prove this beyond all doubt, in the only way such a statement can be. With titles.

A full pre-season, as oppose to one where many of the starters are not in his plans for the season, will allow AVB to implement his ideas with plenty of time and without the hinderance of needing to use makeshift players in his system. Sandro was crucial to Spurs' strong run of results until his injury, his return along with Kaboul's will add serious quality to the starting XI and useful depth to the squad. These two returning will feel like new signings- Tottenham will start next season with a significantly better team before any action in the transfer market. 

A spine of Lloris | Vertonghen-Kaboul | Dembele-Sandro would rival any team in the Premiership. In Lloris, a World Class keeper, in Vertonghen-Kaboul, two modern centre-backs whose style of play should work well together, in Dembele-Sandro, a midfield pivot that can create and destroy in equal measure. This spine of the team being fit for the season would make a dramatic difference, Tottenham would automatically become a harder to beat team and a more consistent team. And don't especially underestimate the effect of having Lloris in goal for all 38 games.

Although not being in the Champions League is far from ideal, it is nothing like the catastrophe so many are suggesting. In the transfer window of 2010/11 when Spurs were in the competition, Daniel Levy showed no changes in his propensity to spend. Last Summer, when Spurs weren't in the competition, they were able to attract players of Lloris', Vertonghen's and Dembeles' quality. Said players signed because they believed in the project that was beginning at White Hart Lane, not because Tottenham had Champions League football. This is another reason I believe Levy will back AVB in the coming transfer window in signing his targets (striker, full back, midfielder); if the club were to rest on its laurels such players would inevitably draw attention from other clubs. 

And then there is Gareth Bale , who will no doubt be useful in attracting new players. I'm sure he'll stay another season (at least) probably signing a new £130k contract in the process. He is World Class, and deserves to move onto a bigger fish at some point in his career if he so wishes, but he is also pragmatic. He knows that AVB suggesting he try a new position in pre-season was crucial to his success this season, he knows that Tottenham have this exciting squad that is going places and above all, he knows that he is the main man here and that the team is being built around him. At 23 years of age and with a 1 year old child, emigrating to Madrid might not seem like the most attractive option- the time will come.    

 Last season the first few fixtures were write-offs as the squad was still lacking in key areas; this season a strong start will be possible. Early season success breeds belief breeds results breeds belief... you get the picture. A good start is something Tottenham haven't had for a good few seasons, it will plant the belief that they can do better than 4th. If AVB hasn't already planted it.

But maintaining results is as much about the starting XI as it is about the squad. In Townsend, Smith and Rose AVB has three players who might immediately be able to contribute something to the squad where they couldn't last season, whilst Holtby, Sandro and Kaboul being around for the full season will of course make a huge difference. Add to that emerging players like Carroll and Caulker, who, having picked up valuable first team experience this season, will be able to mount a proper challenge towards a starting place next season. The result is that next season Tottenham will have squad stronger than that of last year even before any transfer activity. Carroll particularly is someone who I expect to start gaining the attention he deserves next season and really contribute towards Tottenham's title challenge, he is a fantastic prospect and Spurs' homegrown answer to the Luka Modric sized gap in midfield. 

Above all, there exists within the Tottenham team the necessary mentality to win a title. There is great harmony within the squad, the players admire the coach and the team never seem to give up. No matter the money that the Chelsea and Man Citys of this World spend, they can only field 11 players, and as Tottenham proved by being one of two teams to beat Man United at Old Trafford, on their day they can give anyone a game. 

With a bit luck, that is, not picking up key injuries, getting given the odd penalty (not a single one last season) and shots going in rather than hitting the post (if all shots that had hit the post by every team had gone in, Spurs would've finished 3rd) then a title challenge is certainly within the realms of possibility. 

Theoretically speaking  if Spurs were to amass an extra 12-15 points next season, that would leave them around about on the lower end of what is usually necessary to win the Premier League. A total that is certainly attainable considering all the aforementioned factors.

No-one expected AVB's Porto to destroy everything in their path as they did during that incredible season. No-one expects AVB's Tottenham to do it next season, but I see all the factors in place for the realistic equivalent of such a season. The team grew and improved from last season when many expected them to stagnate, I can see that happening again. Winning the Premier League should be the objective, Champions League football a happy consequence. 

Why this year in particular, you ask? Why not in a couple of years when AVB has had yet more time? The answer is simple; because why not? All the factors in place, just no one has really noticed yet.

COYS.

1) John hurt will be doctor 8.5/ the doctor involved with the time war
             pros: the doctor who broke the rules blah blah blah, blood on his hands, convenient continuity gap with the time war
             cons: well just earlier in the episode didn't we hear that that matt smith was the 11th doctor... and wouldn't clara have seen him some point in the doctors timestream
2) ZOMG he's the valeyard
                  pros: speaking of wouldnt clara have seen him the valeyard became sort of a separate entity during the 12th -&gt;13th regeneration making it possible to be part of the doctors timestream but also not
                 cons: well it's also from the least popular series of doctor who and they dont like to visit classic series plotlines because it isolates new viewers
2)pre first doctor
                Pros:  (good theory by nomoremrspiceguy) http://redd.it/1epku2
                Cons:well there's no substantial evidence to support it

What I think; the 8.5 doctor is the most likely but i personally hope that it's somewhere between 2-3, the doctor that 'broke the promise' http://tardis.wikia.com/wiki/Season_6B

You've been told João Moutinho is off to Monaco and that you probably can't attract the likes of Falcao due to our European status (fkn 5th). Who do you sign and why? there are obvious ones such as Benteke since he's had a stellar season and the rest of it but surely there's a few players that have gone under the radar that you're itching to sign?

For me its:

Sell BAE. Lovely guy but been bad this season with all due respect..

Bring in;

I'd spend the majority of the funds we have on a playmaker. Modric left some huge boots to fill and even though we brought in Mousa, he isn't that type of player. For me, this could probably be occupied by someone like Hamsik. Hamsik is optimistic of course, but he's probably what we need. Belhanda for example, can create a lot of goalscoring chances.

Striker!!!! - Anyone at this point. Benteke would be awesome and perhaps someone like Villa for experience

LB - Danny rose may have had a good season, but hes young and will develop more. For now I'd like to see a Coentrao come in or someone like that.

so reddit, thoughts?

So two weeks ago (exactly 10 working days today) I handed the keys back to the estate agents for a rented flat. The deposit was properly registered with a protection scheme etc.

The person conducting the checkout got in touch, I had an email exchange with the letting agent saying somebody would be in touch ASAP about the deposit; that was a couple of days after I handed the keys back.

I sent another email chasing them up last week, no reply.

From [here](https://www.gov.uk/tenancy-deposit-protection/overview) I can see a 10 day limit applies if ""the landlord and I agree""; but what if I the landlord (or in this case, letting agents) has gone quiet?

I did not read anything about ""The Name of the Doctor"" on the internet; all I did was watch the episode and thought about it. A lot. So I don’t know, if someone else posted something similar already, but I wanted to write down my take on it, before I jump into the whole discussion.

This is what I believe: 
John Hurt will be the main antagonist of the 50th anniversary special. He - as far as I understand - is a future version of the Doctor, the one that broke the promise, that didn’t act in “the name of the doctor” and basically became evil. The central conflict of the special will be the eleventh (and tenth) doctor trying to prevent this version from happening. For me, there are two strong indicators for this scenario: 
1. It’s the only possible solution for getting away with “Introducing John Hurt as The Doctor” without him having to replace Matt Smith at some point. And as much as I love John Hurt, he would not fit the current run of the show at all, where a Doctor has to jump, run, scream, fight and do other similar things fairly regularly. He's just too old for that.
2. I really can imagine the meeting, in which they were brainstorming ideas for the special: “Well, we need a really big villain. Someone that is equal to the Doctor in power.” - “The Master again?” - “Nah, he’s overused. We need someone just as good as the Doctor himself…” So, let’s have the Doctor fight against another version of himself. I’m not particularly familiar with the old series, so I can’t say, if this idea hasn’t been used before (honestly, it must have been). 
But nevertheless, to get someone like John Hurt to play an evil future version of the Doctor opens an endless box of possibilities. It sounds exactly like the stuff that Moffat likes. He can play around with timelines, time travel, intercut past and future and all that stuff. With Matt Smith, David Tennant and John Hurt. Sounds legit to me.

Amy rejected who she thought was the Flesh Doctor, but was actually rejecting the original Doctor and accepted the Flesh one. The worker's flesh clone (forgot his name) promised to be a dad to his son.   

Amy automatically accepted Auton Rory without a second thought.   

There was all this discussion about River and and the Doctor not really being married because she married the Tessalecta, but in this episode he pretty much affirmed that he took it at least partway seriously. (I would never bury my wife, calling her an ""ex"")  

Clara declared her copies would be real enough.   

At the end of her first appearance, River seemed appreciative of the Doctor's efforts to save her by making a copy of her, although her discussion with Clara may indicate she felt lacking in some way, not being the ""real"" version of herself.

However, John Hurt is supposed to be the Doctors *greatest secret*. And the events of the Time War are not a secret at all. We've seen Eccleston, Tennent and Smith all openly discuss or reference the Time War and what the Doctor did there. 

So, while it's still possible this is in fact who the John Hurt character is, I don't think it likely, as it would make the whole ""secret"" pretty much void, and personally, I think it's a little too easy. I think he will be someone nobody thought of, and which has never been referenced before.

It was never explained why all the Doctor's enemies think he is to blame for the universe imploding in the Season 5, nor is it adequately explained why the Tardis is exploding. Well, what if the Doctor entering his own timeline caused a large paradox in the universe, causing it to implode on itself and the Tardis to implode? This is why the enemies of the doctor blame him for the universe collapsing. This is also why he is called the butcher of billions as the entire universe was killed by him.

Some (far too lengthy) thoughts on morality, Doctor Who, the finale, and the 50th special:

In the Cyberman episode this season, the emperor is haunted by the idea that sometimes you have to commit one nominally ""evil"" act to prevent a greater evil from occurring (destroy a whole galaxy to kill off Cybermen).  This has been an on-going moral theme for the entire series, manifesting itself in different ways and almost always used as a window into the Doctor's ""soul"" or ""character"".

It's there at the very beginning with ""The Daleks"".  As a classic post-war parable, we are presented with Nazi-like evil Daleks countered by pacifist Thals.  The Doctor and company must convince the Thals that this evil must be confronted, even if that means waging war on them and risking innocent lives in the process.  While the Doctor himself is not overtly in the position of having to sacrifice innocents to prevent a greater threat, he does have to convince others that the ultimate sacrifice may be required of them.  In 1960s Europe (post-Munich, pre-Vietnam), the moral lines aren't very blurred - it's more or less taken as a given that sometimes these actions are necessary.  To end war, sometimes you have to drop atom bombs on people.

By the 1970s, this post-war conventional wisdom was starting to breakdown.  The ""commit evil to prevent evil"" dilemma is probably best encapsulated by another Dalek story, ""Genesis"" with its famous ""Have I the right?"" speech.  As important as this is in raising the question clearly and unambiguously (this is the Doctor directly faced with a ""push the button""/""pull the trigger"" choice), the resolution is less than satisfying. Ultimately, the Doctor doesn't have to make this choice - a convenient coincidence allows him to avoid it and the Daleks are merely entombed rather than destroyed.  I think this is more-or-less par for the course in terms of how the series deals with the issue: some combination of hand-waving, technobabble, and deus ex machina that allow the Doctor to remain morally ""pure"" and still defeat the bad guy.  He (and by extension us) get to have it both ways.

I'd point to ""The Armageddon Factor"" as another example.  At the end of the story, we're faced with the prospect of sacrificing one individual (Astra) for the sake of the entire universe.  The Black Guardian (pretending to be the White Guardian) sees no problem with this, which tips the Doctor off that something's wrong.  Surely the ""good"" White Guardian would at least acknowledge the moral dilemma here.  And yet, events continue that allow the Doctor to (presumably) complete his mission to save the universe but also allow Astra to live.  It's never made explicitly clear how the Doctor avoids confronting this moral choice, but he does escape (morally) unscathed.

Fast-forward to the 1980s and we see a similar situation prevail.  In another Dalek story (""Resurrection""), the Doctor is again directly presented with a ""push the button""/""pull the trigger"" choice, explicitly described as a reversal of his inaction in ""Genesis"": he must personally kill Davros to prevent the Daleks from being ""resurrected"".  Though the series up to this point has tended to gloss over similar questions (sometimes the Doctor has no problem blowing up entire planets to stop the bad guys), here it's a rare confrontation where the Doctor literally has to put a gun to someone's head and pull the trigger - for the greater good, of course, but no less difficult a moral choice.  And once again, the series (and the Doctor) flinches: he hesitates and backs off at the first distraction, missing the opportunity.  Eventually that moral choice is made (in less direct terms) by Stein, who sacrifices himself to kill Davros.

Contrast this situation with the one in ""The Caves of Androzani"".  There, the Doctor is in the now familiar position of putting people's lives in danger - often ""for the greater good"" though in this case it's simply a result of the Doctor's curiosity.  He sacrifices himself to save Peri, to atone and take responsibility for a particularly bad series of letting companions down (starting with the death of Adric and ending with Tegan's departure).  But notice how different (and easier) that moral question is: of course the Doctor's going to sacrifice *himself* to save others.  That's a no-brainer.  The question is: will the Doctor sacrifice *others* to save others?

(I'll just mention briefly how badly ""Trial of a Time Lord"" mangles this question, particularly in the ""Terror of the Vervoids"" portion.  The Doctor is remarkably casual in basically admitting genocide of the Vervoids in order to save humanity (the writing is so bad that it's not even clear that the threat of the Vervoids is itself genocidal: would they have wiped out all of human life, or merely all humans on one planet?).  The fact that the Doctor considers himself justified with barely any more remorse than the Black Guardian a few seasons back shows how out-of-character he'd become in this story.)

Beginning with the 7th Doctor, we see the series begin exploring a ""darker"" version of the Doctor, one who's a lot more comfortable defeating enemies by any means necessary.  He's manipulative, more callous, and tends to treat individuals as pawns in galaxy-sized games of good versus evil (I've read only some of the New Adventures novels, but that seemed to be the direction the writers were heading).  There's always been a tinge of ""big picture"" thinking with the Doctor - an ""alienness"" that can focus on the greater threat without paying attention to the lives of individuals (see ""Pyramids of Mars"") but now this aspect has come to the forefront.

When the series re-booted in 2005, we're presented with the backdrop of a mysterious Time War and the Doctor's ambiguous relationship to it.  It's heavily suggested that he did something wrong/evil - at the very least, something he regrets.  Perhaps it was the culmination of this ""darker"" aspect: the Doctor going one step too far in the quest for ""the greater good"".  Whatever it might have been, however, the series returns squarely to the tradition of forcing the Doctor into these ""do evil for the sake of good"" choices, and promptly letting him off the hook.  In ""The Parting of the Ways"", the Doctor expends a lot of effort (and indeed lives) rigging up a device that will (once again) destroy the Daleks, but also (inconveniently) kill millions of innocent humans as well.  The Doctor seems prepared to pull the trigger, but ultimately decides that he can't.  Another deus ex machina swoops in to save the day, leaving the threat defeated but also the Doctor (again) morally unscathed.

Still, there are some hints that this ""darker"" Doctor lives on.  I'm particularly reminded of the end of the ""Runaway Bride"" and other stories that suggest the Doctor needs a human companion to help him reconnect to individuals and not see things merely in galaxy-wide, ""big picture"" terms that can make him appear inhuman.  In ""The Waters of Mars"", we get an interesting twist on this question: the Doctor is determined to ""have it both ways"" (defeat the enemy and save the individual), rules of the universe be damned.  Naturally, the rules of the universe catch up to him (in an unexpected way), revealing that he's not going to get out of these moral choices quite so easily.  (My recollection of ""The End of Time"" is a little hazy - if anyone can fill in what we learn about the Doctor's actions in the Time War there, or if there are any clear ""do evil for the greater good"" moments, I'd much appreciate it...)

Which brings us to the latest series, specifically the season finale and the revelation of the ""John Hurt"" Doctor.  Most of the commentary and speculation I've seen suggests that this un-Doctor did (or will do?) something so terrible that he even forfeits the name ""Doctor"".  What exactly this is will presumably be revealed in the 50th anniversary special.  But in terms of the moral analysis here, people seem pretty confident that this un-Doctor (like all previous ""dark"" Doctor moments) has/will err too far to far to the side of ""action"" - a willingness to do whatever's necessary to defeat evil, even if that means sacrificing innocents or killing millions or committing other atrocities, all ""for the greater good"".  He will do evil to prevent evil.

But I'd posit another intriguing hypothesis.  Perhaps this un-Doctor did just the opposite.  As the above shows, time and time again, the Doctor is presented with this moral choice: do evil to prevent greater evil, or do nothing - sparing the innocent but allowing evil to flourish.  Since evil cannot be allowed to win in the Doctor Who universe, the Doctor either finds ways to justify himself and (reluctantly) pushes the button, or (more often) something swoops in to save him from making the choice.  What the Doctor does NOT do (ever, as far as I know) is to retreat from that choice, do nothing, and for that inaction to actually lead to the bad guys (in some real sense) winning.  

That to me would be the perfect reversal of this Doctor Who trope.  We're quite familiar now with the Doctor, on at least some occasions, taking that difficult step of ""pushing the button""/""pulling the trigger"" and sacrificing something important ""for the greater good"" in order to defeat the bad guy.  Much as he'd like to avoid it, the Doctor can, at least on some occasions, bring himself to do evil to prevent greater evil.  On other occasions, he can't bring himself to do this, but is saved from the consequences because someone else steps in to make that decision, or something [technobabble, deus ex machina] allows him to have it both ways.  What would be truly novel would be this un-Doctor refusing to, say, sacrifice a companion in order to defeat disembodied ancient evil entity #247, thus allowing disembodied ancient evil entity #247 to destroy whole worlds/galaxies/what have you.  For once, he would be forced to live with the consequences of THAT decision.  Which I'd argue is very different from the standard storyline where, if the Doctor has to live with an uncomfortable decision at all, it's always of the ""I had to let so-and-so die, but at least the universe is safe..."" variety.

Anyhow, that's my spiel.  I'd be interested if anyone else has examples that fit (or defy) these patterns.  There are many stories from the new series whose details I've forgotten.  Thanks!

Edit: Just read some interesting theories about the Doctor in some way being ""the devil"".  Here's how I would fit it into my theory: This ""John Hurt"" un-Doctor is given a choice very much like the one described by the emperor in ""Nightmare in Silver"": in order to destroy ""evil"" (ALL evil, some kind of originator of all evil in the universe), this un-Doctor must destroy the universe.  If he allows the universe to continue to exist, then he will also be allowing evil itself to exist.  He chooses ""inaction"" and must live with the consequences.  So, in a very real sense, the Doctor is responsible for the existence of evil in the universe (even though he himself, of course, is not evil).  Perhaps this all happens prior to the First Doctor.  The un-Doctor then becomes the First Doctor and sees it as his duty to go out into the universe and fight evil wherever he finds it.",false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,null,null,self,[Finale Spoilers]: Thoughts on Morality in Doctor Who and the 50th Anniversary Special,3,http://www.reddit.com/r/doctorwho/comments/1es95w/finale_spoilers_thoughts_on_morality_in_doctor/

I wanted to share my story with this subreddit in hopes that it will be a welcome read to the regulars who have mostly been saddled with linking stories of dischord and dysfunction at the club.

Last summer, I posted [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/vm15q/redditors_ive_spent_over_a_decade_following_the/) thread in /r/soccer - I was headed to London for the summer, and after watching English football from afar for most of my life, I was finally going to be on the other side of the Atlantic, where I always told myself I would take up my local team - naturally, geography placed me right in the middle of a bunch of clubs, and so I had a choice to make. /u/doeboy73 sent me a message about the club, I did my reading, and I was pretty sure I was hooked. I went to Loftus Road and did the tour of the grounds, I became an avid reader of all the news I could get about the club - I was really interested, but I was not hooked.

Then one afternoon, out of the blue, /u/doeboy73 let me know that an additional allotment of tickets had been made available to the pre-season friendly up against Wycombe Wanderers. With a final to take at 9:00 the next morning, I decided to hop on the train and head up to the game. Unfortunately he and I were not able to meet up, but I had the time of my life, got to chat a bit with a few of the players on the touchline during warmups, and I was hooked.

I had to head back home before the season got underway, but of course a lot has changed since I took the train to High Wycombe - a lot of new players joined the team, too many results slipped away, Hughes took the team underwater and Harry could not get it back afloat in time. It became harder to find streams of the games as we anchored ourselves to the bottom of the table, but most weekends I was able to do it, and for better or worse I got up early enough to see the matches I could.

It will be a lot harder to follow the team next year, but between radio streams, the occasional television feed, blogs, and /r/superhoops, I'll be more than covered. It was a rough season no doubt, but it was also the one that exposed me to the incredible supporter community around this club, and it was the season I fell in love with QPR regardless of the results. For that reason, I'll have a hard time looking back at 2012/2013 with bad memories.

1) John Hurt is old 8

2) For the ""timelords don't age"" folks - see the 7 to 8 regeneration sequence where we see an old 7 puttering about the Tardis that gets shot and becomes 8.

3) During the time war 8 loses his mind because he must break the promise and commit mass genocide - of the daleks and the timelords.

4) the mad Doctor vacillates between sane and insane

5) Just before the time lock is finalized the sane doctor tries to find another way.  He hatches a plan with president Borusa to undo what he has done.  In order to do this he must stop the universe.  He can only do this with the Key to Time.

6) Borusa assigns his trusted assistant who takes the name Romanadvortrelundar (the roman soldier) or Fred (the peaceful ruler) to ensure the key is assembled.

7) The white Guardian is the sane doctor

8) The Black Guardian is the insane doctor

9) The Black Guardian, The valeyard and the insane doctor are all the same character.  The goal to destroy ""The Doctor"" from within his own timeline to stop himself from destroying Galifrey and the Timelords.

10) The sane Doctor goes back to the Ribos Project Doctor because this is where he makes his first conscious act to allow death by his actions

11) Once the key to time is assembled ""the great unbalance"" in the universe is corrected.  The timelock from the timewar is averted. We have Galifrey and time lords back.

Predictions- Somewhere in series 8 and the 50th we will see

1) the 8 to 9 regeneration.  

2) Paul Mcgaan and John Hurt in the same episode (flashback style)

3) The story of the time war

4) Matt smith has said he will be back for series 8 - he didn't say for how many episodes (two regeneration sequences in series 8!)

5) for those that didn't notice there is a Clara and doctor inside the doctors timeline and another Doctor and Clara inside the Tardis.

6) The story of how they make their way thru the Tardis to outside the Tardis to the big ""what's your name"" sequence will be a large part of the story line.

7) That Doctor and Clara will help the Doctor and Clara inside his timeline out of his timeline.  This will involve inside timeline Matt Smith regenerating to get out.  The doctor at the ""what's your name"" sequence has already seen himself regenerate. (wibbly wobbly stuff)

The Silence were commissioned by the Hurt Doctor to kill the Doctor in the future so that the Doctor (or anyone else for that matter) couldn't undo what the Hurt Doctor was about to do.  Whatever it was that that Hurt Doctor did, it was so important that undoing it (either purposefully or accidentally) would destroy existence/the universe/time. I'm guessing that event is probably something akin to activating The Moment to end the Time War, and thereby destroying all Daleks and Time Lords.  Whatever it was, though, undoing the action would cause even greater harm.  The Doctor is himself (or at least will be) a loose end that needs to be sewn up.

The Hurt Doctor, therefore, creates a group to stop a future Doctor, which evolves into this Silence Religious Movement.  The Hurt Doctor knows that he can't trust himself to kill himself, lest his next regeneration decides that he doesn't want to go through with it or he ""accidentally"" regenerates without being able to stop himself.  (Remember, The Master prevented his own regeneration, but that seemed to take a huge force of will on his part.)

The Doctor's very clever, though, so he knows that he can't just have someone kill him outright.  He needs to trick himself so he can't plan for it.  That's where the Silence comes in.  He doesn't remember what he told the Silence to do, so he can't plan for it.  The Silence aliens have the side effect of making its victims forget, which is why the current Doctors don't have any memory of creating the Silence. 

The Silence's mission is to stop the question from being asked (so that the TARDIS's doors couldn't be open on Trenzalore).  As Winston Churchill said in TWoRS, the best way to eliminate the secret is to destroy the man who knows the secret.  Therefore, as long as the Doctor was dead or incapacitated, the question couldn't be asked.  

The first plan was to take the TARDIS out of commission and prevent the Doctor from dying and traveling ever again.  They used the Doctor's Enemies who proceeded to lock him up in the Pandorica. The Pandorica was supposed to keep the Doctor alive so that they could destroy the TARDIS. If he's alive but has no TARDIS, he can't get to Trenzalore and he'd have no ""corpse"".  He'd just be in a perpetual alive state. But, separated from the Doctor, the TARDIS blows up (either intentionally or unintentionally) creating the crack in the Universe.  

Remember, the Silence only understand that their mission is to prevent the Doctor from reaching Trenzalore; they don't know that they're not supposed to destroy the universe in the process to stop him.  But fortunately, the Doctor manages to reset the Universe.  

Plan B: assemble an assassin to kill the Doctor. The assassin needs to be able to get in close to the Doctor with stealth and subtlety to ensure that the Doctor does, in fact, die. Said assassin - River Song - actually thwarts the plan by ""killing"" the Doctor and letting him hide in the universe.  Because he's hiding, the Silence believe that they have completed their mission and don't show up in season 7.  

This also sort of explains why the Silence are only going after the most recent Doctor and not any of the earlier incarnations -- going after Doctors 1-8 would create a paradox.  Also, you wouldn't go after him right away; you'd need to make sure the event worked.  

The problem is that the Silence are creating a paradox: they need to kill the doctor to prevent him from dying.  This means that the Doctor wouldn't die at Trenzalore, but somewhere else...Which means that they have to kill him before he reaches somewhere else and then kill him before that...etc. etc. Now, this could mean that the Silence are unknowingly working their way back in the Doctor's history, but it makes my head hurt.  But remember: Madame Kovarian calls the work of the Silence ""an endless war"" against the Doctor... which, now that I think about it, lends credence to my theory that the Doctor gets defeated in his future, creating a paradox, meaning that the Silence have to kill him earlier in his own future.  Eventually, they will have worked their way back through Doctors 10 and 9... which they haven't gotten to yet.

Back to Madame Kovarian's endless war comment.  This implies that that the Silence have been manipulating proxies over the last X thousand years to eliminate the Doctor.  To an extent, we know this to already be true (cf., TIA) and we also know that these people have no idea that they are helping to further the Silence's aims.  

tl;dr: The Hurt Doctor created The Silence to prevent anyone undoing what terrible thing he did.

I wonder though:
Generally, how do the English react to Americans? Do you really hate us? Would people be disgusted by me as soon as they heard my accent?

Also, I know that London is kinda the ""New York"" of England. You know, attracts loads of tourists and is VERRYY expensive.
With that being said, as a young girl, fresh out on my own, should I not love to the Big London? And settle for maybe another county/city that is just as pleasant but not as expensive? That seems to make sense. Also, I know I could always catch a train into London if I so pleased.
Which leads me to my next question:

What counties/cities would one recommend? Which are safe and things of that sort? Which would be suitable for a young person?

I don't want to overload this post with questions, so I do happen to get a response from someone, maybe I'll ask another question if needed then.

Also, I don't know if this matters or not, but I am Black. And, from what I seem to have come across of the UK is that you guys are MUCH, MUCH, MUCH more racially coexistent and it isn't really a factor. (Although, of course there are those assholes.) So, me being Black, would there be certain counties/cities that I would avoid? Like, are some equivalent to the ""Down South"" of the US?

Yes, he has a temper, such as how he gave the Family their own tortured immortality, but other than that (which was extreme as hell) I don't see the fear and monstrosity that I think I should be seeing. It just feels like this idea of him being a monster is being shoved down my throat courtesy of Moffat. This is no hate on Moffat, but it just gets irritating. 

I see a kindhearted Time Lord who is running from his past, struggles with a huge case of PTSD, and  needs a companion not just to keep him in check, but so that he has someone to just be there for him. I don't  see him as a monster. I feel compassion for him.

I really shouldn’t hold it in like that. *THE DOCTOR coughs, and tries to clear his throat* wait, whats this? My voice! Its changed!! It doesn’t sound like my usual voice. I’ll get used to it eventually. Now to find out where I landed. *turns on TARDIS data core, which is reconfigured to look like a medium sized television which is pinpointed to southern New York* Way-Ver-Lee? Waverly? I’ve never heard of the place. But before we go, lets check if we’re all here. *THE DOCTOR checks himself, grabbing his arms, legs, ears, nose, fingers, hands, chin, etc* I feel shorter, but at least im not headless. *THE DOCTOR makes an expression of “are you serious”* I really need to stop being paranoid about that bit..
(THEME MUSIC AND INTRO PLAYS)
(fade in to a wooded backyard, with the TARDIS landing)
The Doctor: let’s just change clothes. This leather jacket I had to wear on Nitrax doesn’t suit me. But I don’t want a bowtie anymore… let’s try a raincoat. *pulls out a red white and black raincoat* perfect! Now the pants should be fine, but I should freshen them with some sort of fragrance so they don’t give off any Neglox 4 fumes. *quickly sprays himself with a generic fragrance* Good thing I bought this on Stengal 8 before I left. Oh! I almost forgot! *THE DOCTOR quickly grabs a pen light* can’t go anywhere without the screwdriver! (Fade out)
*THE DOCTOR is walking along a path in the woods, when he accidentally bumps into and knocks over a young blonde woman*
Sabrina: hey! Be careful!!
The Doctor: *extends his hand to help the young woman up* sorry miss, I lost my bearings for a bit there.
Sabrina: *grabs The Doctor’s hand and gets pulled up* I know that feeling. When you’re in the woods for so long, you kinda get lost in nature *giggling*
The Doctor: you live in these woods?
Sabrina: *chuckles* no, silly. I live down the road. Anyway, my name is Sabrina. What’s yours?
The Doctor: just call me The Doctor.
Sabrina: you’ve gotta have some kind of name!
The Doctor: just, The Doctor for now.
Sabrina: fine. Where do you live? I’ve never seen you around here before.
The Doctor: *shrugging and pointing behind him with his thumb over his shoulder* I just dropped in a few minutes ago.
Sabrina: you moved here today?
The Doctor: I wouldn’t exactly say MOVED, im only here temporarily until my transportation is fixed.
Sabrina: you have a car?
The Doctor: not exactly a car
Sabrina: then how did you get here? Did you fly in?
The Doctor: in a way, yes I did fly in.
Sabrina: I never got used to flying in planes, what about you?
The Doctor: I didn’t come on a plane. I have my own vehicle.
Sabrina: a helicopter or something, then?
The Doctor: it’s complicated. I don’t know how to explain it to you without showing you.
Sabrina: then show me!
The Doctor: you’d like me to show you?
Sabrina: sure, lets go. *she smiles a very friendly smile at the Doctor as they walk down a path towards the TARDIS* just don’t try anything funny.
The Doctor: I don’t do stuff like that. (Fade out)
(fade in to Sabrina and The Doctor inside the TARDIS console room: which now looks like a bedroom with a door leading towards the rest of the TARDIS)
Sabrina: *stammering* its…
The Doctor: bigger on the inside! I love that bit!
Sabrina: how?
The Doctor: just a bunch of wibbly wobbly timey wimeys.
Sabrina: what is this thing?
The Doctor: my TARDIS!
Sabrina: your what?
The Doctor: T-A-R-D-I-S: Time And Relative Dimension In Space. Its my time and space traveling device.
Sabrina: what are you?
The Doctor: im a Time Lord. Well actually, THE Time Lord. The rest of my species is dead. Killed in a great war, along with their planet. Utterly destroyed.
Sabrina: oh god im so sorry. I didn’t know. You must feel terrible.
The Doctor: it still haunts me. *says the next line under his breath* because I had a hand in it.
Sabrina: what did you say?
The Doctor: nothing *clears throat* how old are you, Sabrina?
Sabrina: I’m seventeen. How old are you?
The Doctor: lets just say im older than I look.
Sabrina: why do you keep veiling your answers? Its not a very polite thing to do. 
The Doctor: I don’t want to disturb you. I’ll tell you later, I promise. Aha! Speaking of “look”! *goes to a mirror* oh not bad, the ears are a little big, and the hair is a tad shorter than it used to be. The nose looks a bit irregular, like its been broken or something. *tugs his necklace* thank goodness my ancient necklace is still intact! I look like a teenager! Tell me, how old do you think I look?
Sabrina: you look about seventeen.
The Doctor: oh, hell I like being young but not THIS young! Well nothing’s perfect. I remember when I had that awful multicolored suit. Ugh I don’t know what got into me then.
Sabrina: what exactly are you rambling about?
The Doctor: I just wanted to make sure that I don’t look mutant or alien in any way. I like being humanoid. I always check myself after I regenerate to make sure that I am still intact.
Sabrina: regenerate? What do you mean?
The Doctor: it is change, Sabrina. A change in appearance, and slightly in personality. I was on the planet Nitrax with a friend of mine when we were gassed with Neglox 4 gas. Colorless, odorless, tasteless, yet deadly to any living thing. My friend died from the gas, and I am still saddened by that. But I managed to come back to this TARDIS, and I put it on a course with earth. The only planet where I know I won’t be considered hostile.
Sabrina: just get back on topic. What is regeneration?
The Doctor: ah yes! I apologize, sometimes my mind likes to wander, like an eager Tenderfoot Scout on his first campout.
Sabrina: stop going off topic, Doctor. 
The Doctor: There I go again! Anyway: regeneration is a trick the Time Lords use to cheat death. Whenever the Time Lord’s body is dying, their cells “regenerate” and form a new body. Same person, different look. Sometimes the personality changes, and sometimes amnesia occurs. This is my twelfth regeneration.
Sabrina: so you can’t die? Ever?
The Doctor: far from that, my dear. If a Time Lord is killed instantly, like if their body is blown up or both hearts are stopped at once, then no regeneration will occur. Also: if a Time Lord is injured severely enough DURING a regeneration, the cycle will fail and the Time Lord will die.
Sabrina: two hearts? How… nevermind.
The Doctor: its how Gallifreyans are made. We have two hearts, the second heart is used mainly during regeneration so the Time Lord doesn’t die during the process. I remember nearly dying during my 8th regeneration. I was under anesthetic and the process nearly was destroyed. Quite a painful regeneration, I might add.
Sabrina: you’re full of oddities, you know that?
The Doctor: that’s me. Say, can we get out of this forest? I’m not comfortable in densely wooded areas.
Sabrina: Some friends of mine are hanging out at the park a little ways down the road. Want to go there and meet them? Get you out of the woods.
The Doctor: hold on. *rummages through a trunk* where are they? Aha! Here they are! *holds pair of glasses* I put these on when I need to think deeply. Like my fifth and tenth incarnations!
Sabrina: want to go or not?
The Doctor: yes that sounds nice. Let me just lock up the TARDIS when we leave. She can’t function right now. 
(fade out) (fade in to Park. Ryan, Tim, Jon, Megan, and Darren are sitting at a gazebo talking)
Darren: and then I say: “Hey, that’s not how you use that!”
*the five of them laugh*
(enter Sabrina and The Doctor, walking a path towards the gazebo)
Sabrina: hi guys!
Tim: hi, Sabrina
Jon: hello
Darren: hey there!
Megan: who’s your friend?
Ryan: I just noticed your friend there. Who’s he?
The Doctor: hello, I’m The Doctor.
Ryan: Doctor who?
The Doctor: just The Doctor.
Tim: my name is Tim.
Jon: I’m Jon.
Ryan: I’m Ryan!
Darren: my names Darren
Megan: and I’m megan.
Tim: you look a little young to be a “Doctor”, doctor.
The Doctor: if I told you my age you wouldn’t think so.
Sabrina: he hasn’t even told me *lightly slaps The Doctor’s shoulder* such a weirdo *laughs lightly*.
Sabrina’s Thoughts: *voiceover* I just realized that The Doctor is really cute. For an alien…
The Doctor: *looks at Sabrina and smiles*
The Doctor’s Thoughts: *voiceover* God, she is beautiful. I didn’t notice until now.
Darren: I’ve never seen you before. You just move here?
The Doctor: im only here until my transportation is fixed.
Tim: car broke down?
The Doctor: you could say that.
*ryan and jon stand up*
Jon: just driving through and you get stuck. Happens a lot around here.
The Doctor: im guessing since you’re a small town you don’t get much visitors.
Megan: pretty much, yes.
*The Doctor suddenly gets an expression of distress on his face*
Sabrina: Doctor? What’s wrong? You look worried.
The Doctor: Ryan, you have two shadows.
Ryan: yeah, whats the problem?
The Doctor: you have no idea. Anyone else you see have two shadows?
Megan: lots of people around town have two shadows. Some kind of solar thing.
Sabrina: Doctor?
*The Doctor looks around dismayed*
Ryan: I feel funny, guys.
The Doctor: oh no…
(a woosh is heard as the Vastha Nerada begin to consume Ryan’s flesh)
Darren: Ryan! Whats going on!
*note that Ryan is off camera*
The Doctor: It’s the Vastha Nerada! The Shadow!
Ryan: oh god! Help me!!!
The Doctor: RYAN DON’T MOVE!
*The Doctor aims his Sonic Screwdriver at Ryan, and activates it*
The Doctor: I can’t get the Shadow off of Ryan with this!
Sabrina: Is Ryan going to die!??
The Doctor: unfortunately, yes.
Ryan: SOMEBODY HE-
*Ryan suddenly stops as he is completely consumed by the Vastha Nerada*
(a skull falls to the ground.)

Maybe John Hurt is the last incarnation of the Doctor, his last regeneration, but he's the one who actually fought in the Time War? 

Perhaps the other Doctor's knew about the Time War from some other means? 

Maybe they all fought in the Time War together but the John Hurt Doctor went ""rogue"" over some incident. Perhaps he felt he ""knew better"" since he was the oldest and therefore more knowledgeable of the Doctor's since he would have all of their memories.

As for the name, the one he used instead of ""The Doctor"", is more like a ""nickname"" like Edward I was ""Longshanks"" and Oliver Cromwell was ""Old Ironsides"".

Maybe due to what he did, or did not do, during the Time War he got a rather unpleasant nickname and it was an infamous one, not benevolent.

Maybe his name is something like ""The Destroyer"" or ""Captain Genocide""?

At any rate, I think there has been enough evidence and insinuation throughout the new series to hint that he is the one who might have really killed off the Timelords.

By that I mean any given episode can be at any given point on his time line. This is is frequently shown by his interactions with River.

That being said River tells Rory in Demons Run that her's and the Doctor's time lines are opposite. That means the first time the Doctor sees River is the last time she sees him. And more importantly the first time River meets the Doctor is the last time he sees her. So that means that ""let's kill Hitler"" is the last time the doctor sees River. If i'm wrong at this point then the rest of this is moot so feel free to skip down to the part where you tell me why I'm wrong.

So in ""lets kill Hitler"" the Doctor is with Amy and Rory and its the last time he sees River. But in Angels take Manhattan he sees River there. So by that standard the doctor in ""let's kill Hitler"" is older than he is in Angel take Manhattan. This means that Manhattan is not the last time the Doctor sees Amy and Rory. If this is true I can only imagine how heart breaking that must have been for him. 

So am I on to something here or am I missing something huge and obvious?

If the John Hurt doctor is 8.5 then that pushes every doctor after him up one. So 9 becomes 10 and 11 becomes 12 etc... Meaning that the 11th that Dorium was talking about was actually 10 (David Tennant). The 11th doctor is going to die or fall like 8.5 did in the 50th anniversary special. 

8.5 did something that not only was bad but also didn't go in line with the name of Doctor.Most likely during the time war,but not the event that ended it. As the other Doctors(9-11) all commit some act of mass murder. Including the destruction of Gallifrey in End of Time Part 2.And The meta-crisis 10th was shown to be unstable and committed genocide just after he was born.8.5 had to do something really awful, worse than ending the time war to ""fall"". As 9-11 all have no problem in telling people they ended the time war and it also seems to be common knowledge 

The meta-crisis 10th, now 11th. In my opinion is going to side with 8.5 on something that 12th(Matt Smith) is against. Resulting in him no longer being the Doctor. The fall of the 11th

Imagine it came up in an episode that there was an alien planet where the people worshiped an ancient savior who appeared suddenly in their history and changed their culture forever by healing the sick and inspiring the people to believe in peace and love.  Furthermore, imagine the story tells how that savior died sacrificing himself to save everyone on the planet and then he CAME BACK.  You would have to assume that ancient figure must have been the Doctor doing what needed to be done back in their history.  

Now imagine that planet was Earth.  That's right, I'm not talking Christ imagery.  I mean what if Jesus was actually the Doctor?

The idea of an episode where the Doctor gets stuck in Earth's past for a few years and accidentally becomes known to history as Jesus Christ almost writes itself.  It actually explains a few unanswered questions in the Bible such as what was Jesus doing for the 30 years in between his birth and his baptism?  (the Bible describes only one day in all that time when he visited the temple as a child)  The answer: he didn't exist all those years, the doctor arrived as a grown man.  You could go on and on and it falls into place quite easily.  One of the first things he does when he arrives is start collecting companions (and for that matter most of them end up suffering terrible fates in their dedication to him).  

Of course this would never be written because:

1. A whole lot of Christians would totally freak out

2. Setting the problems of #1 aside, it's almost too obvious a storyline.  With everything else that happens in the Whoniverse, how could that type of figure in Earth history NOT turn out to be the Doctor?

Just thought it was an interesting idea to throw out there, discuss and have fun.  Also, please don't freak out.  ",false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,null,null,self,Doctor=Christ?,0,http://www.reddit.com/r/doctorwho/comments/1eth6m/doctorchrist/

Because it says the word Chelsea in the article, as in, Chelsea are also interested but have no fucking chance and are probbaly just being used as a makewieght in the agents negotiations.

* Ok reading this Journalistic claptrap from the Daily Mail makes you head hurt, it basically boils down to this; Real and Barca may want a central defender so may bid for [**Luiz**](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-2328745/Real-Madrid-Barcelona-battling-lure-Chelsea-defender-David-Luiz-away-Stamford-Bridge.html). This really doesn't do the articles immense bullshit justice though, it's a tangled web they weave.

* Here's a more straight forward piece about [**Luke Shaw**](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-2328682/Manchester-United-boss-David-Moyes-wants-beat-Chelsea-Luke-Shaw.html) and how Manchester united are in for the youngster, thing is he is a Chelsea supporter...

* West Ham are looking to tie up a deal for [**Lukaku**](http://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/transfers-west-ham-want-lukaku-1903337) to support **Andy Carroll** in attack once that lumps decided whether he wants to leave scouse land or not.

* The Mail which is outdoing itself in crap stories today has [**Mourinho**](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-2328766/Jose-Mourinho-leave-Real-Madrid--What-Chelsea.html) chasing Rooney, Ronaldo and Varane for his new look chelsea.

I thought I’d set up this post to see if there’d be any interest at all in an idea of mine. The thing is I love Doctor Who and I also enjoy writing, so my logical mind thought ‘hey, why not combine your two interests and create the tuna cornetto? Also Doctor Who fanfic…’. So after a severe case of food poisoning I threw myself headfirst into a project that I think could be really fun. The basic premise is as follows: the doctor is dead. Everything has to die and the Doctor knew this, but he also knew that his efforts must and will be continued long after his eventual demise. He needed an ace in the hole, just in case he perished before his time, and eventually someone to take over his role as protector of the universe. So he started recruiting, very selectively, the new generation of time’s assistants. Humans, he knew, must be the ones to take up his mantle; his last gift to his favourite species. This is where you come in: I’d love to have a small group of people set up their own characters and share small episodes with me and any others interested in the idea. It needn’t be perfect and would be a great way to sharpen our writing skills and receive creative feedback from like-minded fellows. So if you think you want to be a part of this (who wouldn’t want their own TARDIS?!) PM me and we can set up an email society, or something?, and get things started.

I'm about to inherit somewhere between £60-70,000 (I'm very fortunate I realise) and the real question I have is whether I should look to buy my first house (well, flat).

Bit of background on my situation:

I live in London and currently rent a one-bed flat with the girlfriend, rent is about £1,200 between us.

I have about £9,000 in savings, and recently opened my first ISA which I'll be using from now on. I also recently got my first credit card, not to borrow money but just for cashback and to improve my credit rating.

I've been looking into flat prices; where I currently rent is unaffordable but a bit further from central london, in an area that wouldn't reduce my current quality of life, would be about £350k - though the ones I've seen are all in fairly polished condition, I'd rather find a place that needed some work and do it myself (which might reduce the price a bit). This is for a 2-bed flat I should add, not 1 bed. 

Although I would be putting up the deposit, my girlfriend will split the monthly mortgage payments.

My question is: is investing in property at this point the right thing to do? Will I be able to get a flat in that price range?

Ok, it sounds silly but let's take a look at a few reasons it would be a great move.

* He is out of a job

* He would be a big hit with the ladies of Ashmore Park and Whitmore Reans

* He loves pies and Wolverhampton Wanderers serve up a tasty Balti Pie

* Victoria could go mad in the Manders Centre with all the designer boutiques. OK that may be stretching it. Send her to Beatties.

* Wolverhampton has a decent quota of Wacky Warehouse style operations meaning the mini Beckham's would be kept occupied.

* Spike's Tattoo shop on Broad Street has been in operation for years and would happily kit him out with a Wolves logo.

* The Old Gold surroundings would blend in nicely with Mr and Mrs Beckham's Tropicana tans

* His Brylcreem quiffery is still a popular look in Working Men's club's in the Gornal area.",false,WWFC,t5_2sa1w,null,null,self,A bit of humour to lighten the dark?,10,http://www.reddit.com/r/WWFC/comments/1eu1ib/a_bit_of_humour_to_lighten_the_dark/

I'm looking for some advice on doing my full bike test and the best way to go about it.

Basically I did my CBT last year, commuting every day since so I have quite a lot of on road experience for a learner I guess. Got my theory test next month which should be fine I've got a full car license so surely it will be a cake walk...   

Now I am looking to get my practical tests booked

What is the best way to go about this? Book them all separately and do training on a bigger bike in between? or do it all on a 3 1/2 day course? is that enough to do when I have never rode anything bigger than a 125?

cheers

The time war is locked.
The Doctor and Clara are in the Doctors life stream, which closed behind them after they entered...
The Doctor died on Trenzalore after killing millions.
The Valeyard come in between his 12th and FINAL regen....

So...is it possible that the time stream IS the Doctors final regen? And Hurt is either a metaphor for the unintentional chaos or Hurt is real which means he had to have entered the time stream the same way The Doctor and Clara did.

The time war would be able to be visited since The Doctor lived in it...the memories are there, all around them. What if hurt is a future regen....the next one i think which would become the Valeyard whose death created the time stream making the millions killed by the doctor on Trenzalore the Time lords and Daleks before his death. Which would reopen the time stream allowing The Doctor and Clara to escape.

Just wanted to get an idea of what we all thought about everything and what we feel is the correct choice for us to head in order to get the best results next season. 

Departures: 

**Andy Carroll**: As of today (May 22), West Ham and Liverpool agreed on a deal for Carroll. But Andy has yet to make a decision. What exactly is he thinking? He did really well at WestHam and will definitely get a lot of time there. 

**Suarez**: while it's doubtful there's still the small chance that he leaves this summer. Luis says he's loyal but no one has thrown a ton of cash at him... yet.

**Coates and Skrtel**: What exactly are the chances of them leaving? Especially with Carragher gone we'll need players who can fill the hole. Granted these two aren't the perfect choice. But Skrtel and Agger make a fairly decent duo on the back line. 

Arrivals: (The best parts)

**Kolo Toure**: I feel that this is a solid choice as long as his wages aren't ridiculous. He will probably have to take a drop in pay to move from Man City. 

**Eriksen**: I seriously think Liverpool should just step up and swing for the fences here. They need to do their best to sign him quickly. We know that Erkisen wants to go to a team that offers him lots of time, and fits his playing style. That narrows it down to Dortmund and us. But we can offer much better wages than BVB so we should remove them as an obstacle by getting a deal done quickly. 

There are many other rumours and pros and cons to all of them. Let me know what you guys are feeling about all of this. 

Edit: Just wanted to list all of the players I've seen that are linked with us (either leaving or arriving) for some us that don't know.

Moffat has had plenty of time to plan for the 50th anniversary special - it's not like it's a surprise or anything.

The 11th Doctor doesn't disagree with Doriam's statement. He knows why he has to die, to avert ""a future that is infinitely more terrible"" and ""has to be averted"" by the Silence. So this is something in the Doctor's future, but that he already knows will happen.

This is why I think that the Hurt Doctor is a future regeneration, something and someone that has to be averted. David Tennant will be returning for the 50th anniversary, which would explain why the 11th Doctor knows what will happen since he's already seen it, but even if Tennant hadn't agreed to return, the same could have been achieved if Eccleston, McGann, McCoy, or Davison had agreed to come back. At a stretch it could have been achieved with Matt Smith playing opposite himself. Regardless of which actor is involved, 11 has already seen what will happen.

I don't think that Hurt is the first 'Doctor'. 11 states that Hurt is the one who broke the Doctor's promise - but a promise can only be broken once it is made, and as the first incarnation Hurt would not have made it. I also don't think Hurt was involved in the Time War, since Hurt is a secret, and the Doctor's role in the War is certainly no secret.

So what, exactly, will Hurt do that has to be avoided? The Great Intelligence refers to him as the Butcher of the Ten Billion, Storm, and the Beast (and the Valeyard, of course). But butcher of the ten billion *what*? People? Creatures? Sentients? Planets? Galaxies?

The problem with prophecies is that once they are revealed it is obvious what they meant, but until then there are hundreds of things that they could mean. So here are a few ideas:

In Nightmare in Silver, the Emperor feels sorry for the poor blighter who had to blow up an entire galaxy to stop the cybermen. Was that the Doctor?

In Journey to the Centre of the Tardis, when Clara reads the Doctor's name she says ""So *that's* who"", as if she recognises the name, and now knows who did something that she already knows about. This implies that it is something that happened to the Earth. Perhaps 'Storm' is relevant here - is the Doctor responsible for the biblical flood? Was it ten billion humans that he killed? Was he the storm that caused it? Is the Doctor's name actually Noah? Perhaps this is why he has such affection for the Earth and humanity, above all others - guilt.

Or it may be none of these. Perhaps it is ten billion species. There are so many places that Moffat could go with the hints he has laid down. There's always the possibility that 'Beast' and 'Storm' have nothing to do with the 50th anniversary at all, but Moffat is creating foreshadowing for the benefit of future writers/producers so they can link future episodes to past ones - after all, he linked Clara back to all the previous regenerations. Maybe he's just being kind to future writers.

So, after that wall of text, I think that Hurt is a future regeneration, which is why Clara never saw him, why 11 knows what he will do, why his future has to be averted, but exactly what Hurt will do I am uncertain. Any ideas, anyone?

Obviously not all Muslims are these people.

But the time for a united and forceful repudiation by Muslim Communities across the UK is now.

It is now.

You cannot have this and 'Allahu Akbar' in the same breath. 

Where are these cads picking this language up from. What *land* are they talking about coming from - sounding like *that* - two so obviously British men?

The UK must listen for the voices of Muslims in this - BUT Muslims must speak.

Here it's not an argument, and I'm just hoping that phones are ringing and statements being penned. 

Otherwise *those who are stealing Islam*, have won.

If it looked good on me I wouldn't mind having it longer. But I'd rather have it gone by September. I'm also on a lower budget, no fancy fancy stuff. Basically that means nothing over, say, 20$.

It's frankly become a bit of a mammoth and daunting task, because the more I think about it, the more I have to add to it. So there are at least ten pages in my head. But I still really want to do this, but I want to do it properly. 

In order for me to make it more effective for you all, can I ask that you post any questions or concerns in this thread, and if I can answer them in my 'manual', I will. 

I'll try not to reply to each answer here because it'll be too time-consuming, but if you have discussions amongst yourselves in the thread it may also help steer the way I write.

Alright, so I'm going to my friend's party in late June/early July. And it's a Doctor Who costume party! (Bakers can skip this first part)


The hair question:

I decided I wanted to go as Donna Noble. I don't have red hair, but I love her character so much. My hair is actually a light brown but I dyed it blonde(its a dirty blonde now) but I didn't really want to be Rose or anybody with blonde hair. I don't have much experience dying my hair but I know that the salons around where I live only have red hair dye for streaks- the kind of red a strawberry is. Not what I would want for Donna, because red hair is usually more orangey red, not traffic light red. So I wanted to know if there are any brands I could use to do this. Ideally under 15 or so dollars. 

Here's a picture of me:
http://whenalyssaattacks.tumblr.com/post/51087933064/whenalyssaattacks

And a picture of Donna for reference:
http://images4.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20100227044916/tardis/images/0/03/More_than_just_a_temp.PNG

Also, I'd prefer it to be gone by Septemberish. I guess I wouldn't really mind having it longer, though, but if it's possible at all I would like that. 

TL;DR: need a hair dye to make my hair color look like Donna Noble's. above is a link. 



The other thing is that she wants me to help with food. We've already established obvious things like fish and custard and jelly babies. Are there more food references that we have missed? We'll probably have a TARDIS cake or something. Are there any recipies for things that would be fun, maybe sugar mold sonic screwdrivers and fezzes, or something of that nature. (Recipies and ideas welcome, even if its tying to unrelated things together. Suggest everything you can think of!)

TL;DR: I need Doctor Who related recipies.

I feel like an idiot, but I want to be clear, I have seen every episode from the new series, except maybe a couple specials(which very well might explain it), up to and including The Name of the Doctor.  But I honestly cannot pinpoint their start on the show.  I remember the episodes with the Sontarans and Silurians, but I was confused in A Good Man Goes to War.  They just seem to pop up and aid The Doctor, and I seem to remember them as enemies of The Doctor.  To be quite honest, I'm not sure I even remember the specific named character Vastra or Strax, or even Jenny, before this episode. 

I love them in the new season, and I get excited when they help The Doctor, but I'm just so confused as to where they came in at.

Someone else please post something, this is getting embarrassing. 

*Anyhow.* I'm here to seek your mumsy advice because my mum is clueless about these things. About five years ago I finally found a pair of jeans to fit me properly (it seems that I have a smaller than average butt, every jeans maker since the year dot assume we all have pretty rotund arses), and a few weeks ago, my bum started peeking out of them, by way of a massive split along the vertical seam of the pocket. Delightfully, it chose to do this when I went for lunch with a friend (that's the comedy part), and I had to strip my keks off and sew them up in her flat before we went out. Thank god she noticed them, otherwise I'd have been flaunting butt-flesh all over London unknowingly. Of course I did a piss-poor job, because sewing and I do not get along. 

So, two part question:

1) Can I fix them? We noticed that the other pocket had started splitting at the top of the pocket seam too. When I say 'can I', I mean a tailor or a dry cleaner or such, because obviously I cannot. Funky patches are not an option, I am not a student, nor am I trendy. 

2) If not, where can I buy a decent pair of skinny(ish) jeans without oversized butt space at a decent(ish) cost?*

*Don't even think of telling me to get down to Primark/New Look; years of experience tells me that they don't make jeans for my shape (these babies cost £120 and I'm keen not to spend that again at the moment if I can avoid it).

Thanks mum!!

I used to be a cocktail bartender so love a well made drink. We know Girlwithnousername is a fan of the French 75, a lovely drink made with either gin or cognac, lemon juice and champagne. Make it with vodka and you have a French 76.

I have four favourite cocktails which I will share with you three are rum based, and the other is a killer.

1. Daiquiri- Cuban classic, I prefer the way it is made in the Hotel Nacional in Havana. Rum, lime juice, sugar and a dash of maraschino liqueur blended with crushed ice. Many of these were drank in the company of a good cigar.

2. The Perfect Smoking Barrel- Made in a bar in Huddersfield and is a take on the Manhattan. Havana Club barrel strength, a teaspoon of Laphroaig 10, sugar syrup, a dash of orange bitters and a dash of maraschino liqueur, stirred with ice and poured into a chilled cocktail glass and served with a cocktail cherry.

3. Royal Mojito- a take on the classic. Use any aged rum you prefer Diplomatico Reserva Exlusiva is my preferred choice. Couple of lime wedges, teaspoon on sugar and mint in the bottom of a glass with a double shot of the rum and muddle. Fill glass with crushed ice and then fill with champagne. Stir gently and add sprig of mint to the top along with a lime wedge.

4. Death in the Afternoon. Champagne flute, drop a sugar cube in there and follow it with a shot of absinthe, stir until sugar is dissolved and top up with champagne. A lovely but deadly drink.",false,TheRedLion,t5_2vrbs,null,null,self,What is your favourite cocktail?,10,http://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedLion/comments/1ewc5m/what_is_your_favourite_cocktail/

It is just something I was thinking about.

Should the recent attack in Woolwich be considered terrorism, or an act of war?

Terrorism usually describes attacks against civilians for the purposes of instilling terror in a group. This describes 9/11, the July 7th bombings, the Boston bombings, etc. But in this case the attack was solely designed to kill a serviceman. No civilians were harmed, despite there being the opportunity.

On the other hand, we are curently at war (though distance helps us forget). Though the war is against the Taliban, it was originally sold as a 'War on Terror'. Declaring war on abstract concepts seems to be a rather silly tactic, since any deranged homicidal maniac can decide that they identify with the enemy. And unlike a concrete enemy, like a country or government, who can denounce these people as nothing to do with them, an abstract concept is silent. So, with the benefit of hindsight, it seems that the 'War on Terror' declaration can and has led to idiots deciding that they are on the side of the enemy. Once they've taken that worrying step, they will obviously feel quite justified and duty bound to go out and attack military personel.

So, should we react to this as we would an act of terrorism, with horror at act itself. Or should we react to it as an act of war, accepting the act itself as a consequence of the war we have gotten ourselves into, and saving our horror for the fact that British people should decide to go over to the enemy.",false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,null,null,self,Act of terror or of war?,0,http://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/1ewe4m/act_of_terror_or_of_war/

I'm originally from North Yorkshire but haven't spent a lot of time in the UK for the last 10 years.

The last time I was there, I was only actually living there for a few months so realistically it's been about 6 or 7 years since I really lived in the UK. So I'm quite out of touch with the place.

Firstly, would you recommend moving to the UK at this point in time? If so, why? If not, why?

Secondly, priorities. How much is a pint these days? I bought a pint of Coopers Pale Ale and a glass of Sav Blanc tonight and it cost me $14 (£9) which was unusually cheap. It's usually in the region of $20 (£12) for a round of that description.

Where would you move to if you had the choice? And why?

I'm a web developer (with over 15 years experience) - what is the likelihood of finding a job with a reasonable wage (I've been getting used to pretty fancy Australian salaries)?

Where are the best job prospects, outside (I assume) London?

What is the cost of rent where you are? At the moment I'm paying equivalent of £270 a week rent for a one bedroom apartment (with a balcony). It ain't flash but it's not totally full of cockroaches (I murdered a few this evening).

How much for a meal in a typical pub? My dinner tonight (a pretty crappy standard bit of steak with mash and vegies) cost me $19 (£12). You can eat cheaper than that but not by a lot. Generally eating out costs you a fair bit more.

Oh, and how much is a Gregg's Sausage Roll?

1) Style

Minor quibbles, but I HATED the opening sequence, narrated by Clara. It was like the opening sequence they used for the US series with Amy, where it wasn't just the theme music, but had to hinge on the assistant and some adventure or narrative focusing on them. 

Likewise for the ""Introducing John Hurt"" thing at the end. What was that about? Don't break the illusion and start talking about actor names inside the show. I don't care about John Hurt, I care about whatever character he plays, and it seemed wildly out of place. 

2) Lazy scripting

+ Why did River say the doctor's name to open the tomb? Never explained.

+ The great intelligence ""died"" stepping into the doctor's lifestream, and was scattered all over time and space. Its stated numerous times that to step into the stream is to die. Clara then did it, and was also scattered, and saved the doctor. Hooray! But then the doctor did it and was fine? Ended up ""inside himself""? And somehow Clara was there too, and he could rescue her? So you don't die then, it seems. But in that case where was the great intelligence - why wasn't he there inside the doctor too? Zero continuity: You die, oh no you don't, oh look we're rescued! LAZY LAZY LAZY.

+ The great intelligence himself....the master architect of this plot to end the doctor, but why? Who was he? Where was he for the past two series? Absolutely ZERO build up in the previous six episodes to lead to this point. He just popped out of nowhere for this INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT series finale, and then failed and was defeated in about 4 minutes. 

+ Side note - where was that paramilitary organisation that kidnapped river? What happened to them? We're they working with the GI?

+ Which leads to the failed event build up itself. The doctor must NEVER go to Trenzalore. EVER. Fate of the universe, etc. Except he did, and it was all peachy, AND it was always going to be peachy because as soon as they mentioned that stepping into the timestream scatters you across a person's timeline, it became immediately obvious that Clara would do this to save the doctor (which is why he keeps encountering her), and so obviously it was all going to be fine. Drama disappears for the rest of the episode, everything ends up wonderful, absolutely zero fallout. He must NEVER GO THERE? It appears to have been as dangerous to him as eating a freaking peanut.

+ River song is a library hologram? And the doctor has ""never replied to her"" when she talks to him because it hurts too much? Have you seen her pop up in the recent past? Have you EVER seen hologram river chatting to the doctor who stoically ignores her? No? Me neither! So a big emotional closure piece pops out of nowhere with no justification and no build up, making it nothing more than a weird distraction shoe-horned into the plot.

+ Also, he can touch the hologram! Apparently! He can grab and kiss what it was stated MOMENTS BEFORE is nothing but a digital projection. Because, you know, that makes perfect sense. 

Thats all I remember from the top of my head, I'm sure there was more at the time that annoyed me which I've forgotten about. 

In essence, this show feels like a mess of massive unresolved plot lines that dangle over gaping plot holes, with an incredibly badly paced, lazy, badly constructed script trying desperately to shove things along. 

It. Was. AWFUL.

Can anyone help? I'd love for the above to all be brilliantly explainable and clear and it just my own inattention that spoiled it for me.

BF wasn't a fan. He doesn't like overly corny, which I think was a mistake in my part introducing him to a Christmas episode (they're all corny, but I love it). 

So, what do you guys think would be a good episode to re-introduce him to the Doctor? I was thinking maybe ""Blink""

I started a business last year, it's going OK, I employ 3 people, it can pay it's own bills and pay the employees. Very soon in the next couple of months I should be able to start paying off my debt again.

Outgoing:  
Loan payment: £200  
Credit card min payment: £35  
Car insurance: £70  
Car loan: £150  
Overdraft charge: £7  
Total: £462  

I was able to pay this at one point, but I made a mistake with employees and at the time I was working a lot along side them, then I lost a few clients. I'm now not working with them but working on the business with marketing, networking, recruiting admin etc.

My Boyfriend is paying household bills and after I sold all my possessions he's paying my personal stuff (posted above) this month. He's had enough of it. I can feel that he wants to break up with me, but he knows I would be homeless, and I'm about sick of him too. We're just not happy together anymore.

I've looked into benefits and I wasn't entitled to anything because together we earned over £300 a week. (When I was taking home that £400).

How do business owners pay their personal bills while starting up a business, without the support of spouses or parents?

I can't move back home, neither parents work (trying so hard to make a career and money for myself so I'm little like them as possible) so they can't help financially, I don't have any friends willing to put me up. I can't just move as I have no money. What can I do?

I'm aware that this may not be the right subreddit if you could direct me in the right place I'd really appreciate it.

*Edit*
I should mention, that I've asked my old boss to work at weekends and they don't want me, (they need someone like me but don't want me). I have printed out my CV, been to one interview for a small bar job, but they want someone more available. I'm making time this weekend to apply for weekend jobs).

I know this can belong in /r/cosplay too, but I figure the local Whovians would have a better grasp on the subject. I'm working on a Whispermen costume and I wanted some advice on the types of clothes they wear. 

I'm using this photo as a reference (brightest picture I can find of them)
http://static.hypable.com/wp-content/gallery/name-of-the-doctor/the-name-of-the-doctor-whispermen.jpg?033a17

The coat I got already (sans the fur trim, but for 5 bucks I can't complain). The white shirt I believe is a ""wing collar"" shirt. The black vest and that red/black tie/ascot thing I can't really get a good ID on. Also, the hat and gloves, are there particular terms for the type they wear with how ""wrinkly"" it looks (or even just for the shape/size)?

For anyone wondering about the obvious part, the face, I plan to get a morphsuit mask, and cut a hole out for the mouth. Add a little markup around the lips and presto!

Any other suggestions would be greatly appreciated. Thanks.

Not sure if I scared him, but he said with a combination of condescension and defensiveness, ""Do you even *know* what this shirt means?""

I could say no and let him school me.

I could say yes and leave it at that.

I could say, ""No, only losers and nerds watch Doctor Who,"" but that's both rude and inaccurate.

I decided to go with tact and said, ""Ha! F*** you. Why would I comment on your shirt if I didn't know what it meant?""

I felt kind of badly because he began to stammer that people didn't normally know what it meant, then the girl looked the other way and pretended he didn't exist, then the valet brought up his convertible Mercedes and they left.

I'm going to try to keep it brief, but this is an unusual offer. 

If anything about this sounds intriguing or if you have any constructive comments, then definitely get in touch with me with some info about you, your experience and situation.

I have been working at a small digital marketing agency since early last year, originally with a team of ~5. Since January, I've been running the day-to-day ops, managing all clients (generally restaurant industry) and doing all the work singlehandedly. I'm good at my job, but I'm at a bit of a crossroads and I have to either move on, or make a commitment and really go for it with this company, but for that I will need some help and I don't think an intern or another employee will cut it. 

We've got some great clients and really exciting leads. I don't own the company, but have a great relationship with those who do. To be honest, I've been reluctant to get involved in that aspect of the business because I feel inexperienced (I'm in my early 20s, this was my first job). I'm looking for someone who is looking to join as somewhat of a partner in crime, and really help grow the agency and make it into our own thing. Obv, this isn't much info to go on, but I'm willing to divulge more to anyone serious. Let me know your thoughts...



&gt;
&gt;I've also kind of tried to fill this out, just for the sake of it: 
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;**Job title:** Whatever you want it to be.  
&gt;
&gt;**Description:** See above
&gt;
&gt;**Location:** Central London

&gt;**Salary:** TBD
&gt;
&gt;**Requirements:**  You've got good agency and marketing experience (preferably social media), and are also very interested in the entrepreneurial/businessy side of things. 
&gt;
&gt;**It'd be nice if:** You've always dreamt of starting your own creative agency, but were just looking for the right opportunity to come along. This is it, on a plate.

    *scream*

I'm no audio expert, so I didn't try and extract the screams for comparison, but it sounds an awful lot like a Matt Smith scream, yeah? 

I was recently watching the Ganger episodes (rebel flesh &amp; almost people) and the scream the ganger doctor makes while transforming/solidifying, sounds suspiciously like the scream heard near the end of tnotd, when 11 was using the PA system in his timeline to explain to Clara that everything down there was him.

So my question is this, -since they made it a point to teach Amy that the flesh Doctor was every bit as real as he was, and then capped his death with ""this may not be the end for you""- how REAL is this Doctor to us, in terms of that timestream event we witnessed?

I had only 1 suitable property I could get. On Mill Rd. It's 600 per month for a all inclusive double bed room, En-suite, cleaner every 2 weeks. But is shared by 10 people in a 9 bed house. Kitchen looks like a crack den. Unfortunately it was the only one that was furnished and available for my job start date. 



Anyway I got it begrudgingly but asked if I could have about 300 quids worth of work done before I moved in which cancelled out the ridiculous £150 ""admin"" fee.  Management company were surprisingly cool with it. Even managed to get a personal mini fridge thrown in too. And a new bed. And some shelving (even though there was plenty of cupboard space I just wanted them).  



But I was thinking. The room looked like shit before I moved in. Now it looks like a £600/month room (Ikea furniture but whatever). Shame about the rest of the house. Why do people accept living in such shitty conditions for £580/month (the rent the last tenant paid for 3 years). 



Anyone had similar experiences or know people living like this? or is it just Mill Rd that is like this?


Been living here for a week. Room is fine. Kitchen is still depressing. Might get everyone to demand a nice dining table.

One thing that particularly bugged me was the ending of [The Angels Take Manhattan](http://www.dailymotion.com/video/xu4eja_doctor-who-2005-s07e05-the-angels-take-manhattan-internal-hdtv-xvid-afg_shortfilms) (skip to 36:00 in).

This is my first post here, so sorry if I make a mistake or something.

Ok anyways, Rory gets sent back 50 years before he was born, and Amy makes the emotional decision to join him even though the doctor says he can pretty much never see them again because of ""too many paradoxes"" caused by the angels.

Now we could take this *explanation* at face value, but considering everything that happened I disagree with the Doctor's reasoning for not going back. I think he lied to Amy in order to get her to go back in time and live a normal happy life with Rory. Without the *threat* of the dr randomly showing up, they can finally get along with leading their normal life, settle down, and start a family (they adopt a boy in P.S. in 1946 named Anthony Brian Williams).

Here's my reasoning for thinking the dr purposefully lied to Amy so she could live a happy life without him.


* One of the ""rules"" for the Matt Smith version of the Doctor is ""the doctor lies"". We can't really take anything he says as the truth because of that rule. He could've been telling the truth about the paradoxes, but only he and river actually understood how it worked. River was in on the lie in order to let her parents live a normal life. The audience, and Amy has to take their word for why the TARDIS cannot just go back and pick rory up


* During the episode of the angels take manhattan River says to amy and Rory ""never let him see you age"". Now why would she say that if it never comes up as a plot point after that moment. The Doctor never gets a chance to see them age anyways. It adds to a theme we've seen throughout series 6 and 7 where Amy and rory are getting older, and it's about time to settle down. Every time they do start to settle, the dr shows up for another adventure.

* Amelia Pond was and will always be the ""girl who waited"". As long as there is a chance of the dr showing up again she is always going to hold out a little bit of hope that he'll come back for a new adventure. She'd be less inclined to start a real family and settle down if shes holding out hope and waiting on the dr. By telling her he can never see her again if she goes back in time, the dr pretty much gets rid of any hope Amy could have of the dr showing up for another adventure. There's no point waiting on the dr, time for real life to start.

* at the end of TATM the dr hugs both amy and rory. When he hugs them he closes his eyes for seemingly no reason (36:44 in the video). One explanation for why he could've closed his eyes is he saw the angel in the graveyard, and he was letting it move into place so it could ""zap"" either amy or rory fairly quickly without being frozen from being seen. He kisses both of them on the head because he knows what he has done, and he most likely will never get to say goodbye to whoever the angel chooses to take first. Now the opening shot for the graveyard scene shows an angel statue (36:00) it is supposed to be implied that that is the angel that zapped rory, but about a minute later (37:18 to be exact) post-hug the camera does another wide shot and that statue hasn't moved. So the audience thinks the angel didn't move during his eye closing hug. Well the statue we see isn't the real weeping angel. It's just a statue. The wide shots are meant to throw the audience off. The wide shot statue has longer hair and a softer face than the weeping angel that zapped rory. The statue we saw wasn't a weeping angel, so that's why we don't see it move after the dr gives his hug.

* The dr knows that continued travels with him usually lead to heartache, pain, and even sometimes death. River warns them their travels eventually won't have a happy ending multiple times during the series. Amy &amp; Rory truely love each other, but they also love the dr and river so of course they'll almost always agree to going on a new adventure. If the dr decides to just leave them and never show up again, he knows that they'll feel like he abandoned them. He needed to find a way to let Rory and Amy off easily so they could be happy, without upsetting them and making them hate the dr. Sending one back through an angel, and then lying to the other telling them he can't ever go back because of paradoxes was his way of letting rory and amy go. He has seen throughout the series both Rory and Amy will do crazy things to be together (rory waiting as the centurion for example) so he knows that if one goes back then the other will follow.


* Amy lived ~65 years after she went back through the angel. They were sent back ~50 years before their birth so they'd be about between 1938-1940. Amy would've lived until about 2003-2006. I haven't finished the Clara Oswin Oswald parts of this last season, but if the dr is telling amy the truth that ""he can never see her again"" then that puts a huge limit on where the dr can travel. If he can't see her again, then that would mean he can't go back to a year where amy was alive otherwise his supposed paradox will tear new york apart. Unless of course he was lying about the paradox being like it is, and he can still go back to any time he wants as long as he avoids amy. (side note: The dr knows he's sending them back to wwii, but he is okay with that. He has seen that Rory survives into his 80s, and amy could not be a soldier during the conflict since she was a girl. Amy is perfectly safe in New York during the war. The doctor knows they come out of it okay)


* when rory gets sent back (at about 37:25) they are all piling into the TARDIS. The dr and river go in, but they basically shut the door in amy's face. As amy is opening the door to go inside, that's when rory calls her back to look at the gravestone. Why would the dr shut the door on amy knowing she was coming in right behind him? Three reasons. First so the dr can tell river to go along with his plan and agree with his ""paradox"" explanation (river has already acknowledged that traveling with the dr isn't good for the couple. So he knows she'll agree with the dr's explanation in order to help make the lie more believable. She knows it really is what is best for both Rory and Amy.). Second, is so there are less eyes around in the graveyard to freeze the angel, it's only rory and amy there to freeze it and they don't know it's there. Third is so he can protect river and himself from being zapped by the angel, and being the ones sent back in time. If the doctor, or river is sent back, then they would pretty much have to use the tardis and go back and get them. His whole plan of lying about not being able to go back would unravel.


* I'm sure there are other things throughout the season to help me justify why the dr would lie to amy and rory for their own good, but I haven't been able to really analyze it all except for TATM episode. Something just didn't sit quite right with the ending to me.


**tl;dr** The Doctor lies to Amy about not being able to go get Rory because of a *paradox*. IMO something just didn't seem quite right about that whole ending sequence. He lies so they can move on, settle down, and live a normal happy life together. When he saw the angel in the graveyard, he formulated a plan right then and there to let rory and amy off easy from their adventures so they wouldn't feel abandoned by the doctor. The dr meant for one of the two to get sent back because he knows the other one would decide to go back in order to be with him. 

It's all up to interpretation, and that's just the way I interpreted it. You can disagree or agree. I haven't finished the whole season, so a later episode I haven't seen could completely undo my theory (please don't put any spoilers from the second half of series 7). I can't really prove that the doctor actually did mean for all that to happen, but remember rule #1 *The Doctor  Lies*

I have no problem, as a tax-payer, with supporting deserving fellow citizens of my country. If a survivor of a car accident is left unable to work for the remainder of their life, fine, our government should be there to provide for them.

Where I have more of a problem is with those who abuse the system. People who, frankly, are lazy and damaging to our country.
I found myself watching one of those cop programmes recently, in which the officers described the effects of a benefit ""payday"" on levels of crime and antisocial behaviour. There are people who will wait by an ATM in the middle of the night for their payouts to arrive, only to go out and spend half of it on alcohol and narcotics. What makes it worse is that most of these people, should they be so inclined, are capable of taking some training and finding work to contribute actively to our economy.

I see this as a pretty major failure of the system. In my opinion, money that is donated by the taxpayer for the support of the needy should not be allowed to be spent on things such as alcohol and tobacco. In fact, by allowing these items to be consumed, government is further increasing the coats to taxpayers from healthcare and policing. Benefit spending should be restricted to necessity goods like staple foods, water, electricity.

How to implement this?
I suggest that instead of bank transfers, benefits should be distributed in the form of vouchers or tokens. With the cooperation of retailers, government would limit the spending of these vouchers to goods that are deemed appropriate.

As well as improving the welfare of claimants, such a system would provide a strong incentive to remove oneself from the benefit scheme. Anyone with dignity is unlikely to enjoy the shame of having to present shopkeepers with a benefits voucher, and nor are they likely to appreciate limits on their spending. I would say that such a system could have a big impact on reducing the costs of benefits to government and to society as a whole.

Obviously, I am aware that I have generalised. I am sure the vast majority of benefits claimants are fully deserving of support, and I am not suggesting that such a system should be imposed on them. I'm referring mainly to those who claim benefits while unemployed, and especially to those who are voluntarily so.
The introduction of such a system, would, in my opinion, have to be accompanied with a total overhaul of the system. I have many other issues with the current situation, but I won't go into detail here.

What are your thoughts?

But the EDL are a distraction from the issue of radical Islam. If you question the good sense of giving the Islamist attackers a platform (by filming them and showing those speeches on the news) - how much more should you question giving a platform and attention to a group of disorganised yobs? 

Finally, *not* addressing the central issue of radical Islam poses the greatest threat not to us (non-muslim UK citizens) but to muslims themselves. Here's why;

If you don't deal with radical Islam, these attacks will continue to happen. You can't stop radical muslims driving or carrying knives. Perhaps incidents will continue to be sporadic and rare, but perhaps they will increase. 

Every time something happens, the EDL gains support. Anti-muslim sentiment increases amongst the least-educated, least-self-controlled members of our society. If they continue to grow, and continue feeling increasingly angered without an outlet, they won't go out and attack violent muslims (they aren't smart enough to differentiate), but normal muslims. The people hurt and killed won't be white british soldiers, it will be your average muslim family man.

* The last time that Chelsea and Manchester City met was in last season's FA Cup semi-final at Wembley in April. City went on to the final only to lose out to a late Wigan winner.
* Carlos Tevez (pictured right) has scored six goals in his last seven Premier League games against Chelsea.
* There have been five penalties awarded in the last six league meetings between the two sides.
* Chelsea's Player of the Year Juan Mata scored 16 goals and provided 20 assists in all competitions last season.

* Chelsea also toured the US last summer, taking on AC Milan, Paris Saint-Germain and an MLS all-star side.
* Manchester City's partnership with the New York Yankees comes after arch-rivals United had originally setup a commercial deal back in 2001.

I'm having some trouble breaking up the time/races though because the 'verse is so big! So, I'm thinking of breaking it into Human Empires. Thus, the first setting would be the First Great and Bountiful Human Empire and it encompasses all that humanity (as a whole) encounters during that time.

* Setting includes 3 different systems (one's already in ruins) and two handfuls of other planets over the span of 500 years (2480-3140). [Also, Earth is fucking dystopian at this point so that's cool]
* Playable races include humans, ice warriars, solonians, silurians, Sea Devils(maybe), Draconians, Sensorites and Jovians. No Time Lords in this game yet.
* ""Fixed points"" (events the GM can choose to partake in) include the colonization of several planets, the CyberWars, the Second Great Dalek War, several skirmishes with the natives of planets we take over.

The key idea is that it's not a ""Doctor Who"" RPG, but a ""Whoverse"" game.

Another concern is for those taking the subway. According to [the MTA website](http://www.mta.info/weekender.html), there will be some planned service changes for both the 4 and D trains. The 4 train will skip 161st going downtown, meaning to get back into the city we'd have to go uptown to Burnside Ave, then head downtown again. For the D train, it's the opposite; the D will skip 161st going uptown. Getting there via the D means you have to go up to Tremont Ave, then switch over to the downtown Coney Island bound D. 

Last year I drove, so what I gathered from parking is that the mall charged around $50 for parking, and the price rises rapidly as you park closer to the stadium.

BT Infinity is due in my area (Scotland) this/next month and I'm contemplating a switch of provider, however given the 12-18 month initial commitment, I'd like some opinions.

I'm currently with Plusnet, and I've had a mixed experience with them. 

Pros:

* They have a UK based support staff.

* They're low cost.

Cons:

* I've had quite a lot of cause to call their UK based support staff especially over the last year

* I think I've suffered once or twice from traffic management where websites arbitrarily slow down then suddenly speed up.

* My connection has gradually got slower in the last year, and despite an engineer visit to the premises (which took about 3 months over the course of two really bad connection drops that lasted days on end). I used to get about 1 megabyte/sec download, and now it's about 500-600k, but they refuse to acknowledge it because it's 'Within the speed range' for the line. Which sucks.

Anyway fiber should be here next month, and I was looking at the various packages offered and the total cost etc.

I'm ideally looking for someone that offers plenty of monthly bandwidth (I'd rather be told that I have 250GB a month to use than to be mislead by an 'unlimited' bandwidth promise that restricts you when you go over 80gb or whatever), with a good upload and download speed. Upload speed would be especially beneficial as I upload a lot of video content and am a bit restricted at the moment because it's only about 40k/sec upload.

The packages I'm considering (I've omitted their first 3 months reduced costs since I'm looking at the 'real' cost of a year going onward).

[Plusnet offer a 76MB down and 19MB up]( http://www.plus.net/home-broadband/broadband-only/) for £19.99 a month, there's normally a £50 activation fee, but this is cut to £25 because I'm an existing customer. They offer unlimited bandwidth but they do however traffic manage, and I'm wondering if that's part of the problem I've been having with them as sometimes internet browsing seems slow, then suddenly picks up. Anyway this would make it £240 a year plus the one off £25 activation, a total of £265 for the first year.

[BT offer Infinity 2]( http://www.productsandservices.bt.com/products/broadband/packages), a 76MB down 19MB up with unlimited bandwidth and no traffic management for £26 a month (I'm omitting the line rental charge since I already have a BT line and it's the same price as what I pay now). There's also no activation charge. This makes it £312 a year, but with no activation charge it's only £47 more expensive than Plusnet for the first year, and offers a [no traffic management promise]( http://www.productsandservices.bt.com/consumerProducts/displayTopic.do?topicId=31942#unlimited_usage). They give a £50 Sainsbury's voucher which kind of negates the first year difference, but my main draw is the totally unlimited and no traffic management.

I'm am swinging towards BT at this point, as I'm feeling a little left out in the cold by Plusnet. Having been with them for about 6 or 7 years, they're not interested in an almost 50% speed drop in my line and earlier in the year I had 5 days where the connection just kept dropping every 10 seconds and was unusable. Many promises were made about 'ongoing tests before an engineer would be sent out', but when it seemed to recover they just shrugged it off and didn't want to investigate why I'd had a 5 day outtage. 3 Months later I had a similar problem and was much more forceful, which got an engineer out but has ultimately led me to this point with a much reduced line speed.

So I'm really looking for anyone who's got BT infinity or Plusnet fiber (and any other recommendations you have) to tell me what actual day to day use of the service has been like, and especially BT customers, if you've had to use their support what's it like?

Thanks for your time :)

About us: VouchedFor is a disruptive Start-up in the financial services sector. We like to think of ourselves as the TripAdvisor of independent financial advice. In other words, we let people find, rate and review Independent Financial Advisers and have plans to do a whole lot more.

We’ve already secured partnerships with major industry players, received great press coverage and have the backing of an awesome group of investors with successes like Betfair, Zoopla and Gumtree under their belts.

We’re based in SW London and are currently recruiting two Graduate Interns to join our growing team.

Description: There are two roles up for grabs

Social Media and Communications Intern

Raising awareness of our brand is key to making us grow quickly. Working with our Communications &amp; Marketing Manager you’d be instrumental in devising and implementing campaigns to ensure that VouchedFor becomes synonymous with personal finance. Regular tasks will include:

Social: Write unique engaging blog content; Engage our audiences through social media (e.g., Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn); Manage our blogger outreach programme
PR: Develop insightful reports, analyses and infographics; Draft press releases, surveys and pitch stories to trade and consumer journalists
SEO: Develop and manage a link build programme; identify opportunities for on-site optimisation

Business Development Intern

Generating and fostering new relationships as well as building on existing ones within in the industry are key to driving our business forward. Working with our Business Development Manager you will be at the forefront of our B2B efforts, making VouchedFor a must have for every IFA. Regular tasks will include:

Account Management: You’ll be in charge of nurturing relationships with IFA’s and developing new systems to ensure that our growing database runs without a hitch
Onboarding (Just our fancy word for getting advisers up to speed on the site!): VouchedFor is always evolving which means new options and packages for our IFAs. This role involves keeping the IFAs up-to-date with current changes and ensuring they’re on the best package for their needs
SEO: We’ve developed a successful link building programme (you’ll have the keys to the car to make it even better!); identify opportunities for on-site optimisation
B2B Marketing: It’s all about getting our name out there in the industry so you’ll be involved in generating new business through your weird and wonderful marketing ideas.

Above all don’t forget we’re a Start-up so no 2 days will ever be the same. It’s about diving in, coming up with ideas, trying them, figuring out what works, and doing more of it. We’re always open to fresh insights and there is plenty of scope for the roles to evolve. We are all the time.

Salary: Initially we’ll be looking to pay National Minimum Wage but for the right candidate we’d hope to turn this into a permanent salaried role. However, if you’re set on joining a blue chip and using us as a stepping stone we’ll be happy to have helped you on your way.

About you: You’ll have graduated from a good University and be dedicated, full of ideas, happy to get involved and give things a go. We’re looking for analytical minds, so you’ll be adept at identifying issues and solutions and spotting opportunities, and how best to maximise them. Both of these roles have huge potential to grow, and the right people will be instrumental in helping to shape our business. An interest in personal finance and/or relevant work experience would be a bonus but not essential as we’ll be here to get you up to speed.

Most importantly... How to apply?

We’d like to see your CV, but just as importantly we’d like to know why you’d like to work with us. So ditch your usual blurb and let us know in one sentence, maybe two, why you’d like to join the team… Bonus points for originality!

You must have full entitlement to live and work in the UK.

I'll be moving to Belfast in about a week, i read some old posts and gathered some infos, but still i would like to have some more recent information and advices.

Cost of Living:
I estimated that i'll be earning around £1100 per month, i'm not sure about much i'll have after taxes (i'm moving from abroad), my initial idea is to take a flat just for me, i've seen some in range of £300-350, can you estimate how much i'll spend on bills per months? Is Belfast considered to be an expensive city? This leads to my 2nd point.

Where to Live:
As much as i've previously enjoyed living in shared apartments so far in my life, i feel the need to have a place on my own, if i can make it reasonable what i earn. Any tips on where to find a place, rather then gumtree.com and various websites, is it worth to look in newspapers and such?

Meetups:
Anything planned each month or so? Would be nice to meet some new people and fellow redditors. I see the last planned one was about 1 year ago. In case anyone that would like to go for some casual drinking? :)

Suggestion:
I see there were a few similar posts to mine, maybe would be nice to create a little Wiki with some of the most basic answers, maybe not worth it.

TL;DR How much will i earn after taxes on a £1100 salary. General advice on where to find a cheap decent flat to live. Future Meetups?

I personally think ""Blink"" is a great introduction, and consequently how I was introduced, and here is why I think so.  I copy and pasted most of this from my argument in the other discussion.  
  
&gt;It principally features new characters who were never on the show before, in fact the episode is remarkable because of how little the doctor is in it.

&gt;You get the fact that he's a time traveler from the little video he appears in, and you get that he's in trouble and needs help. You don't need to know anything else about him because he doesn't do anything substantive in the episode besides give them a warning.

&gt;It's rather similar to being in the position of the character in the show who is wrestling with this otherworldly thing, and the doctor shows up on a tv and explains some stuff, but neither you nor the characters know who he is or why you should listen to him, but you believe him.

&gt;Just to opine a little further on what I mean.

&gt;You start the episode with no information on who the doctor is, or what this show is all about. You follow this character who then encounters some otherworldly phenomenon. Nothing seems to make sense to her, or to you until this man shows up on a screen and tries to explain some of it.

&gt;But he doesn't do an amazing job, so you still don't get it. This is exactly the same position the character is in during the show. Figuring out this mystery with the same amount of information as you have.

&gt;Eventually the episode ends after the character herself has prevailed, not through direct intervention of the doctor. You are left with the same questions as she is.

&gt;""Blink"" is an episode that precisely leaves you with questions, while at the same time showcasing the major tone of the show with some of the major elements; danger, excitement, mystery, time, and space.
  
&gt;You understand exactly everything you need to know in order to decide whether or not you will like this show. Everything is there in precisely the right quantities because the doctor is introduced to you in the exactly same way he's introduced to every other character in the show. With a splash, and very little introduction.    
  
**TDLR:** Sorry about the length, but the basic gist is that Doctor Who is introduced to you as the viewer in the same way he is introduced to every character in the show.",false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,null,null,self,"Discussion about the utility of ""Blink"" as an introduction to Doctor Who",57,http://www.reddit.com/r/doctorwho/comments/1ezbt1/discussion_about_the_utility_of_blink_as_an/

Its such a sore point. This killing could have caused chaos. So far it has not.

Early days I know, but I've been really impressed by how quickly the Government AND Muslim Representatives have framed this for Britain...an unacceptable, individual act of appalling horror.

I have heard the Government ask for patience while they figure out the extent of the involvement of organised terror, and Muslims acknowledge and condemn the violence in the name of Islam.

More than anything, amid the very deep revulsion, and very deep questions about what it means to be British, I recognise and feel, a conscious and deliberate effort to bring out the best in what it really DOES mean to be British.

Even the media on the whole, has avoided simplification and  acknowledged Britain as one - the very opposite of the message the thugs intended to ignite.

There are very difficult questions on both sides. And today...the poor, poor family.

But somewhere, really to my surprise and muted admiration, is the articulation of something I thought Britain had forgotten how to do...one of a Britain that *can be*...a Britain with a dream that's not dead yet.

I am watching Britain *choose* to believe that they are a work in progress, and that they have the power to become, who they *say* they can become.

I'll watch the rest of the month - but even I feel empowered. Whatever else people might say, freedom and democracy can change the world.

From what I've read he never played much for Liverpool, did he just never click? Would love to get him permanently if money allows.

Michael Ngoo is best left unmentioned...

e: Few people asking for thoughts on Ngoo. He's had his moments and started off decently enough, although pretty much the only thing going for him has been his strength. Most of the goals he's scored could have been scored by anyone, plus he's been our slowest player and massively indecisive to boot (his indecision's lost him a good few easy goals). When we played in the League Cup final he had several chances to settle the match but messed it up in amazing ways, and we then went on to lose it (final score was 3-2). What doesn't help is that our only other capable striker, John Sutton, is a very similar style (tall, strong, slow), so we've had no real pace or skilled target men up front, meaning we have a real lack of actual goal scorers.

It's a shame because if he could bring his pace and dribbling up a few notches I reckon we'd have a really good player other than that. I think a large proportion of our disappointment comes from how excited we were at first (massive striker coming from a team like Liverpool, plus he scored on his debut for us iirc) and how he turned out.

Also Danny Wilson has been modelling our new away strip, so hopefully that's some promising foreshadowing.

The Master could choose how he looked when he regenerated. And it is believed that it's only Gallifreyan law to have 12 regenerations, meaning that because Gallifrey has been destroyed he can regenerate infinitely. Now, this means The Doctor has regenerated to date 11 times, this is his twelfth face. But if Time Lords can choose or control how they look, how come The Doctor isn't ginger yet? And when [THE NAME OF THE DOCTOR SPOILER ALERT] Clara jumped into The Doctor's time stream, how come she only saw eleven faces? She said she ""saw all eleven faces."" Does this mean that The Doctor will not regenerate again? The Doctors tomb's [MORE SPOILERS] main room had the same design as the current TARDIS, does that mean he will die before his next change of 'desktop theme'? That was a reference to this: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X7boeBf5pbQ . I also believe that The Doctor's favourite regeneration was 'Ten'nant. Here's why:

He got married to Rose
Had a close friendship with Martha and Donna
He had finally got over the Time War
He left his companions on good terms and fond memories
He really liked being Ten so much, he cried when he began to regenerate

But here's the issue with the 50th anniversary, Ten meets Eleven, so why doesn't Eleven remember what he would look like? (This goes for the original episodes too, when multiple doctors would meet). Will Steven Moffat try to justify it with a memory wipe or will he leave it, saying ""well, it was a few years in Ten's life until he would regenerate, he would have mostly forgotten!""

1. Season one (2005) starts off with ninth doctor. Do I need to know why he is the 9th and what happened to the first 8 ?

2. I've been reading that there were a lot of specials in between seasons and if not viewed can cause some confusion when jumping from season to season. Are the missing episodes only between S04 and S05 ?


Anything else you would like to inform me before watching the series would be grateful.

Does anyone know when the decision will be made as to our new Vice-Captain and who do you guys think deserves the role?
I for one would be very happy with Agger being given the honour and maybe it will also make him that much more of a leader because he is already so cool on the pitch but also quite vocal and commanding. He does need just that tad bit more discipline and awareness but this sort of responsibility is what I think will get the best out of him as it will bring out the passion we all know he has in him for this club. A bit long winded but my first choice for sure. Lucas is a pretty close second for his experience, determination and strength and work ethic in the middle. Both of them are very classy men who are great role-models and on their way to being truly inspirational if they're not quite there yet. Please let me know what you think!

Thanks Carra

Edit: I'm seeing a lot of people mentioning Reina as a strong choice which I agree with but I like an outfield player to be there handling things. Giving Suarez the responsibility could help his game a lot. Lucas is getting a lot of shouts and it seems like he's the most popular on here. I would be just as happy with him as I would with Agger but I would still have our Great Dane telling the boys what to do from the back and organising the defense and overall form from his vantage point.",false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,null,null,self,New Vice-Captain?

Continuity gets a bit wibbly wobbly when you throw in time travel, but Doctor Who pulls it off Magnificently. I haven't really gone back to watch any of 10's episodes, but Watching River and the Doctor's relationship is just heartbreaking. And it really made River's first appearance in the show and last meeting with the Doctor so much more emotionally intense. 

  When I first watched Silence in the Library/Forest of the Dead, it was hard to feel the full emotional effects of their relationship. It was too small of a window to grow attached to River. Sure, it was emotional, but I wasn't too torn up about it. I figured she was just another throwaway character. Three seasons later, River's last adventure with the Doctor killed me inside. Even The Doctor's first kiss with River was so powerful. The pain in her eyes when she realizes the end is near. His first kiss is her last. Imagine dying in front of the person you love, and they don't even know who you are. No kiss goodbye, no romantic send off, no spoilers.
 
  And the helpless look on 10's face as watches River sacrifice herself to save him.This stranger knows everything about him. Who he is, where he's been, and even his name. He couldn't save her. The woman who is just as clever and as stubborn as he wouldn't let him do it. It would be the last time she saves his life. 

  River Song and the Doctor is Moffat's best work on DW in my opinion. 

TL;DR After watching the Timeline of River Song, Silence in the Library/Forest of the Dead had me drowning in feels.

First of all my name is James and I'm 30 years old, from Glasgow, Scotland in the uk. Basically I've led a really bad life up until about 7 years ago when my daughter was born :). Since then I've found it really really hard to live a honest life and that's the God honest truth. I'm on a methadone program now and I've been free from drugs since my daughter was born. I've always been told to get myself off drugs and things will get better, but honestly I don't feel as if they have. My daughter stays with my sister just now as I'm also fleeing violence because I was a witness in an attempted murder trial. So it's not really safe for her to stay with me at the moment. My criminal record is so bad I don't think I'll ever get a job, I've been trying so long now and it's deflating every time I get no reply again or your not what we are looking for. I'm just hoping there's a Glasgow redditor on here who would give me just one chance to prove I can do this and build my life back together, feel safe and be a family again. I would do any job asked of me and any hours at all, all days of the week. I hope there is someone out there who can help me and/or could give me some good advice as to what I could do better my situation. I've not went in to all details as I don't want it to sound to much like a sob story but basically I feel like I'm just waiting to die here, as sad as that sounds it's true. After I've done my job hunting during the day then it's sitting at home in front of t.v wishing and thinking what if?  What if I never touched drugs? What if I never committed crime? Anyway I'm done, I hope there's someone out there who can help. 
Thanks for reading. 

JimmyJay.
