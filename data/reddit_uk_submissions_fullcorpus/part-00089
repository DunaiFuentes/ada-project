I'm just hoping to get some feedback for them to try and help out. 

I have already suggested a few things like having a universal mobile phone charger for people to use for free and having local artists hang their paintings up for sale in the shop and local music as well. 

I have a question about sandwiches though. They want to serve sandwiches with coleslaw and crisps on the side. I'm not really sure about this. What's the best sandwich you have had in a tea room and what was it served with?

**Voting:**

* Upvote the player of your choice

* (optional) leave a reason why you pick said player: *Outstanding improvement since February, contributed a lot in the 5-0 win over United at Old Trafford..such and such* - Your reason may help convince other people that the player of your choice is deserving 

------------------

**Why this format?**

* This is not a 'vote for the best player overall' post, this is to decide who has been the best player in March and a number of arguments can be made for some players that doesn't necessarily reflect on the number of goals they have scored.

* It gives you a chance to make your point why you have voted for somebody and then it allows somebody to either add on to your point OR argue against your point (respectfully). 

* Not all players listed may have played much (or at all) but have been listed because it can be hard to remember who has and hasnt featured much

I am really, really fed up of this season so far and I out blame squarely on the choice of writers.

Every writer this series (including Moffat, who in my opinion hasn't been at the top of his game since season 5), has written sub par, almost pointless episodes. 

There's been almost zero character development for Clara, despite her being the main arc for this half season. I haven't felt any empathy for the character since she was a dalek, even though Jenna Louise Coleman is a great actress. 

The main culprit for me is Gattis. I love him as an actor, but he can't write a logical, interesting doctor who episode to save his life. But even excluding him, the other writers feel like second tier talent to save money

The closest they've come to a well rounded story has been 'Hide' and even that lost any power and creepiness it had built up by making the main monster a friendly creeping thing, wanting to have a transdimensional hook up. 

It's honestly made me scared for Gaiman's story. I had hoped it would be the crown jewel of a superb season leading up to the 50th, but now I'm rather worried. 

Even JTTCOTT was weak. The characters and set pieces were unbelievable, dialogue was completely forgettable, and of course it had to have some kind of monster in it. But what could we expect from the guy who wrote the pirate ship episode. 

It just makes my blood boil. Every episode has gaping plot holes or tears new ones into established facts from previous episodes. With at least 10 missed opportunities for great scares, character development or greater lore building every episode, you have to wonder what they're thinking. 

What do you all think? Am I going mad?

Edit: Glad to see people sticking to the 'don't down vote because you disagree policy'. I'm not trying to knock Who for fun, it's my favourite show bar none.

Second thing was Clara's reaction to the doctor's name... it was not one that the name was unreadable or unpronounceable, to me it was closer to 'I know that name' as if the Doctor is actually someone who has either been in her past or has the name of someone that has influenced us a lot...

It's been posted on here and r/gallifrey by multiple users and I'm sure some kind soul who's not on mobile will link it. 

There's a few good reasons why people have been speculating this. 1) CAL's last words were ""aren't I a clever girl."" 2) her skill with technology (hacking the dalek, the wi-fi etc...) And there are more. 

But user waterintheforest posted the meanings of Clara's name and it got my wheels turning. Clara: bright and clear. Oswin: friend of god and then this...Oswald: god of the forest.

Now CAL was the care taker/god of the library. Silence in the Library's second half was Forest of the Dead. CAL was essentially the god of that forest. Also Lux means bright light. Another small connection. I just found that interesting. 

Now let's get fan-stupid. The username of waterintheforest got me thinking as well. Going on their lead I connected water to its most basic semblance. Life. Water = life. Then the line that I'm sure is this users namesake popped in my head: ""The only water in the forest is the river..."" Which kinda seems like, when combined with the library = forest concept, the only life in the library is river. 

Now for the massive reach: the library was once a forest, it was cut down to build the library and fill it with the books. When you cut down an entire forest you're left with an empty field. Just wild speculation, but even ten only calls the planet the library. What if the forest planet was called trenzalore, and it was reduced to nothing but empty fields to construct the library. 

Obviously I have no clue as to what is right or wrong, but it seemed interesting to me. I don't think its right honestly, just throwing out my fun speculation while I can!

Chelsea Line Up: Chelsea: Beeney; Aina, Davey, Ake, Wright; Loftus-Cheek, Baker (c), Colkett, Kiwomya, Boga, Feruz

Subs: Killip, Dabo, Conroy, C. Musonda, Swift

**I guess I will just make this the Match Thread.**

* Great chance after 45 seconds for Jeremie Boga after an excellent pass by Charlie Colkett, but Cameron McGeehan makes a last ditch tackle.

* A slightly nervous start from Ola Aina sees two misplaced passes but he recovers well to dispossess Josh Murphy. That'll calm him down.

* Colkett having a great influence very early on already. A second wonderful pass in behind releases Feruz, who is just offside.

* Chelsea very quickly into their stride and appear to be in confident mood. Ten men went to mow ringing out from a corner of Carrow Road...

* Nathan Aké muscles Jacob Murphy off the ball and the Norwich winger goes down asking for a penalty. Nothing doing.

* Kiwomya fashions a clear cut chance for Islam Feruz, who receives the ball 8 yards out but skies his shot horribly over the crossbar.

* Lewis Baker gets into a more advanced position for the first time and shoots from distance, but can't get it anywhere near the target.

* Not for the first time, superb play by Kiwomya out on the wing results in a golden chance for Feruz, but he snatches at it again and misses.

* Jacob Murphy whips in a dangerous looking cross from the edge of the box, but it's just too tall for Carlton Morris at the far post.

* Midway through the first half and it's Norwich City 0-0 Chelsea. The Blues have had the better of the game and have a corner now.

* The corner produces another chance as Colkett drills one low to the onrushing Baker, but he plants a shot wide once again.

* As expected, Norwich look particularly threatening whenever either of the Murphy twins get to run at Aina and Wright.

* Timely header from Aina to clear the danger after Cameron Norman had gone past Boga and Wright on the flank and crossed well.

* Chances for Aké from close range following Baker's free kick but Britt saves the first and Norman gets the second off the line. Close.

* Now the influential Colkett has a sight of goal after a neat layoff by Feruz, his fierce shot takes a nick off the defender and goes wide.

* Alex Kiwomya's crossing has really improved this season. Wins a corner with one there, was well struck and into a good area. Goal Line scramble goes out for a Goal kick

* Feruz looks for a Pen, Ref says No and Play continues

**Half Time: Norwich City 0-0 Chelsea. The visitors have had the better of the game and should really be ahead but it's level at the break.**

* Lots of options on the bench for Viveash, who will use them. Swift is the obvious, but Musonda on the bench for a reason as well.

**No changes, and the second half is underway.**

* Harry Toffolo attempts to score with an overhead kick in the box but a foul is given for a combination of him and Morris fouling Aké.

* Strong five minute spell for Norwich; no chances really made from it but they're playing more of the game in Chelsea's half than before.

* Chance of the game for Norwich goes to Carlton Morris, who gets onto a loose ball, beats Davey but curls over. Big, big moment.

* Baker flashes a shot wide from a long way out on his 'weaker' left foot.

* Chelsea substitution: John Swift on for Charlie Colkett. A like for Like substitution. 

* Another chance for Norwich as Jacob Murphy gets the ball out wide on the right, but like so many tonight, the shot is wide.

* Attendance is over 21,000. Incredible from both, but especially the Norwich fans.

* Swift shoots from long range, but it's an easy low save for Britt as the shot lacked power.

* Kiwomya jets off on a dazzling 40 yard run, slaloming through yellow shirts, but sees his shot blocked at the end.

* Chelsea substitution: Charly Musonda on for Islam Feruz. The Youngest of the Musonda Brothers and the most talented.

* Alex Kiwomya has gone up front, Jeremie Boga is on the right, and Musonda has started on the left.

* Norwich City substitution: Roderick Young on for Cameron King.

* Swift bursts through the middle and plays Kiwomya in through the right, but a poor first touch sees the moment go begging.

* A similarly poor touch by Jacob Murphy prevents him from having a clear run at goal. Kevin Wright eventually wins possession back.

* Quick feet from Musonda works shooting space, the rest of the story is the same as it's been all night. Wayward finishing.

* A brief interlude for an injury to Rod Young allows both teams a breather and to gear up for the last eight or nine minutes.

* A first booking of the game; Ola Aina went in rather wildly on Ben Wyatt after losing the ball and is cautioned for doing so.

* Murphy jinks through into a good position but with Young well placed for a through ball, he overhits the pass.

* Davey pings an excellent long ball into Loftus-Cheek in behind. He's well onside but takes his eyes off the ball and totally misses it.

* Penalty to Norwich City. Alex Davey stumbles and tries to head the ball clear whilst prone on the ground, but fouls Murphy. 93rd minute.

**GOAL, 1-0 Norwich** 

* McGeehan leathers the ball into the roof of the net to give Norwich the edge in the FA Youth Cup Final.

**Full-Time Norwich 1-0 Chelsea**

* A stoppage time penalty gives Norwich a 1-0 lead heading back to Stamford Bridge in a fortnight.

Although I'm a fairly competent driver, due to a number of stupid reasons I've failed my driving test a couple of times. The cost of paying to use an instructors car for a couple of hours alongside paying for the test itself is taking each attempt up to around £100 which I'm obviously finding a bit painful. Consequently, I'm thinking of ditching the instructor and using a family members car that I've been using to learn in (and I'm insured to drive) for the test itself.

I've read through the info here: https://www.gov.uk/practical-driving-test-for-cars/rules-for-cars-used-for-driving-tests and I think I'm more or less good to go, but I'm still a touch nervous about doing it. Friends and family are advising me against it, telling me that they'll scrutinise my own car more than they would an instructors and things of that nature. I appreciate this is probably BS, but I don't want to be worrying about this on the day of the test which will in all likelihood be nerve racking enough already. Can anyone that's had any experience of this advise me on what to expect from doing it in my own car?

Also, while we're on, can anybody recommend some reliable L-plates that don't mark the car? I've been using magnetic ones and 99% of the time they work just fine, but on a particularly blustery day they have been known to fly off, leaving me with the undignified task of having to chase them down the road. I imagine if conditions were comparable on the day of the test and something similar were to happen that would probably be an insta-fail due to the car suddenly not being fit for purpose or something along those lines. 

Thanks for reading, any recommendations are greatly appreciated :)

Edit: Also, could you recommend any checks that need to be done on the vehicle before the test itself to make sure everything's hunky dory? In the past I've only noticed the examiner check the tax disc and poke their nose around the tires but is there anything else that I should check? I'm confident the car is totally road worthy but I don't want to trip up over something daft and forego the test fee before I even start.",false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,null,null,self,(Yet another!)

I had an epiphany while watching the newest episode of Doctor Who, Journey to the Centre of the Tardis, that made me realise why I'm not enjoying the new Season (specifically part 2) and new companion (Clara).  

I think, unintentionally, Moffat has created a Writing Paradox.  

This last episode was everything I could have wanted: Temporal conundrums, Secret views into Tardis Rooms, a scary baddie that was more than what it seemed, a human moral dilemma, the works.  It should have been exultant.  

But in the end I felt... Meh.  

And I realized that the problem is between **Clara the Story Arc** and **Clara the Character**.  They are mutually annihilating forces.

DW's arc for this season is about the Strange Normalness of Clara.  Almost every episode, the Doctor's true goal is to discover why Clara exists, and each episode his search fails.  We have no theories on what Clara is because the show has given us no hints.  None.  Clara continues (boringly IMO) to be nothing special, without a single chink in the facade, even for the audience. 

But this has a flaw.  It means that **Clara's character cannot develop**.  Any sign of who she really is, who the underlying person is, the truth of her character will reveal something about who she is, ruining the plot mystery that the writers are so overwhelming clinging to.  

Why I think this is fascinating is that the whole  ""Meh-ness"" of the episode is due to the fact that Clara is completely 2 dimensional.  She runs, she rolls her eyes at the Doctor, she runs some more.  She doesn't even really get scared.  

And when she reads about the Time War, all she cares about is his name.  She doesn't react to the horrors that the Doctor perpetrated to help the Time Lords.  (This last bit is conjecture of course, but makes for a much better story.)  

As long as the Clara Plot Mystery carries on without a crack, a single foreshadowing, the longer Clara's character has to languish.

And I think it's fascinating to see exactly the value of good character growth is for a show.  Here's an example of a perfect DW type plot.  but it falls flat on the simple absence of a Companion who has character.  

The Doctor can't carry the show alone.

**TL;DR Clara the Plot Device and Clara the Character are mutually exclusive properties, and the DW writers have chosen plot of character growth.**",false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,null,null,self,My fascinating reason why this season (and new companion) are Meh.

For example:

The Girl in the Fireplace - http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0562998/ - previous 9.2 now down to 8.7

Doomsday - http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0756450/ - previously 9.1 now down to 8.7

The Family of Blood - http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1000256/ - previous 9.0 now down to 8.7

Blink - http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1000252/ - previously 9.7 now down to 9.5

Silence in the Library - http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1208129/ - previously 9.0 now down to 8.7

Forest of the Dead - http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1205440/ - previously 9.2 now down to 8.7

The Angels Take Manhatten - http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2378951/ - was sitting nicley at around 9.1 and has since nose dived to 8.6

It's nothing new for episode ratings to bump up and down, but for 5 episode that aired years ago to all drop to the same score (other than blink, but at 9.7 knocking its considerably more difficult to knock).
AT first I thought it could perhaps be because IMDb maybe changed something in their algorithm for their weighted scores (since most the drops were very sudden), but only Doctor Who (and supernatural) have been remotely affected and it's only to their very high scoring episodes.

Any ideas on how we can try and report this? It's a shame to see the reputation of such great episodes be damaged on a very well known site because of someone with a grudge.",false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,null,null,self,Someone on IMDb seem to be doing their best to knock down Doctor Who reputation.,23,http://www.reddit.com/r/doctorwho/comments/1dd7w8/someone_on_imdb_seem_to_be_doing_their_best_to/

    former Reds. Most are well-known players. Not saying we should sign them, but hopefully this list gives

    relatively low wages.

We spend all of June occasionally writing Bad Wolf in so many different places, just as we would have done in that one day. The day of the Silence worked because during the episodes with them in it, everything happened so quick that we didn't see a great time length where they had the tally marks, but I think Bad Wolf should be bigger and better than just a day, ESPECIALLY since it would follow the story of Doctor Who! Talk about Whovian awareness then! Everyone would see Bad Wolf at some point! But I need your help, I can't spread this by myself. I need everyone that agrees with me to spread this around to any social networking site and Whovian you know! Also, if anyone has any contradicting ideas or opinions, let me know, I'm eager to hear!

Relevant links: [Nick Walters](http://drskagra.wordpress.com/2008/06/10/the-doctors-name/), [WMG: Doctor Who Series 7](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WMG/DoctorWhoSeries7), [WMG: Doctor Who with Spoilers](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WMG/DoctorWhoWithSpoilersInterrelatedWildMassGuessing), [Spoiling Spoiler - Journey to the Centre of the TARDIS - That pivotal scene](http://www.reddit.com/r/gallifrey/comments/1dawj4/spoiling_spoiler_journey_to_the_centre_of_the/) (the latter of which I haven't read all the comments on).

I should note that I don't know of any theory that fully makes sense and accounts for all the [hints and references](http://tardis.wikia.com/wiki/Aliases_of_the_Doctor#The_Doctor.27s_real_name), even just in the modern series - ""it's more than just a secret"", ""there's only one reason I would ever tell anyone my name"", ""silence will/must fall when the question is asked"", ""the question you've been running from your whole life"", ""so that's who"" and so on. What did he see in the untempered schism, the moment he supposedly started ""running""? Will knowing about his name shed light on what happened at the Medusa cascade, and what happened when he and Susan finally stole the Tardis and left for good?

I'm sure the season finale will either ignore or give completely unsatisfying answers to most or all of those questions, but dang if I'm not impatient to get it over with all the same. Three more weeks....

Anyway, on with the guesses. To be (possibly) edited as I think of more.

----

The episode, and the asking of the question, won't be about the Doctor's literal name, but about who he is. It'll be a moral test, along the lines of ""Coward or killer?"".

The Doctor's name is Death. [Death is the only answer.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHu2JNfHG9A)

[The Doctor's name is, itself, literally death.](http://doctorwho.livejournal.com/3161743.html)

The Doctor's name is his life. Doing what he does, ""every day, every second"", is the only way to speak his name. (What River whispered was something like ""This is your name."")

The Doctor's name is, literally, evil; doing what he does is is how he runs from it.

The Doctor's name is the [Deplorable Word](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deplorable_Word).

The Doctor's name is a formula in block transfer computation that, when spoken with the proper ceremonies, alters reality in some way.

The Doctor's name unlocks the Time War.

The Doctor's name opens a portal back in time to the universe of the Great Old Ones; the beings that the Beast from the Pit, the Great Intelligence and Akhaten are weakened shadows of.

The Doctor's name is the weapon that ended the Time War.

The Doctor's name collapses the time vortex, stranding him in the present.

The Doctor's name, with whatever collateral damage it causes, will be the last resort to stop the return of the Old Ones.

The Doctor's name releases an evil entity trapped inside him.

The Great Intelligence will retroactively create the Doctor, or vice versa. (Or swap one of the above with Clara.)

I've run into passing references to a theory that the Doctor's name is a song; possibly even the show's theme song. Not sure what to make of that.

The first syllable of the Doctor's name is infinitely long.

The Doctor's name is a string of vulgarities. Silence will fall because the name literally can't be said in Doctor Who's time slot.

The Doctor was a fictional character, until his fictional world was somehow made real, in the process erasing people's memories of its having been fiction. When Clara said ""So that's who"", the name was prompting her to remember the fictional Doctor.

The same, with the twist that the fictional world was Doctor Who (or an obvious stand-in), but the character who became the Doctor wasn't the Doctor.

When Clara said ""So that's who"", she was realizing the answer to an unanswered question in Summer Falls. (Note: I haven't read it.)

When Clara said ""So that's who"", she was realizing who the woman in the shop had been.

The woman in the shop was the same woman who appeared to Wilfred Mott in The End of Time.

The Doctor's name was supposed to have been erased, and the revelation that it wasn't will bring dire consequences.

The question is actually [""Doctor, who?""](http://www.reddit.com/r/doctorwho/comments/1d77op/speculation_of_the_fields_of_trenzalore/).

The Doctor's name is 42.

[The Doctor's name is Bob.](http://doctorwho.livejournal.com/3161743.html?thread=50968207#t50968207) (Don't ask me what it means when he says ""Bob's your uncle"".)

The Doctor's name is Faust (or Faustus).

The Doctor's name is Susan Foreman. To quote another theorist, ""she assumed her grandfather's identity after he died in the Time War"", and she's been running from that memory ever since.

The Doctor was once an incorporeal alien, possibly a Great Old One, who entered a young Time Lord's body when he looked into the untempered schism.

The Doctor was once a member of another species that used a chameleon arch or the equivalent to become a Time Lord. Possibly the name itself is his fob watch.

The Doctor's name is I Am.

The Doctor's name is Lucifer.

The Doctor's name is Nothing; or is literally nothingness.

The Doctor's name is Nyarlathotep.

The Doctor's name is Silence.

The Doctor's name is literally silence.

The Doctor's name is literally infinite silence.

The Doctor's name is the solution to the Skasis paradigm.

The power of Trenazlore is so great that not only characters, but also their actors, are unable to lie. The man who's been ""running"" from his name isn't the Doctor, but Matt Smith.

The Doctor is or was a Tardis.

Every Doctor has been the Teselecta (or a descendant of its technology). There was never a real Doctor.

Thoughts? 

""BUT THAT MAKES US REALLY NARROW!"" It really doesn't. Enrique and Johnson are effectively playing as wingers, and Sturridge, Coutinho and Suarez drift everywhere.

My feeling is that formation would get the best out of Coutinho and Sturridge. Suarez is the wild card. He can do whatever the fuck he wants, as long as he knows Sturridge is playing down the middle where Coutinho can get balls to him. I'm REALLY excited about next season. What's weird is that after seeing the way our attack linked up on Saturday (I know Newcastle were shit), I'm not as worried about Suarez leaving. If anything him not being there allowed the other players to shine. Obviously a team with Suarez is better than a team without, but I'm just saying Sturridge thrived as the lone striker, running in behind and holding the ball up. He was excellent. We need Coutinho playing behind the strikers, not out wide. That's pretty clear now.

So after seeing this image I started to think about the possibilities... and they were just as endless as the TARDIS. 

What if, the time war never stopped and was never contained and is still raging on.


I'll let that sink in for a sec.


It was always said that the Doctor found a way to contain the Time war, so that no one could ever go there again. (I think this happened between Doctor 8 and 9??^[citation ^needed] ) Gallifray was a part of that which was lost when the Doctor supposedly ended the time war.

But what if, instead of shutting off the Time War, he shut himself inside the TARDIS. Removing himself from the Time War and convincing himself that he was still traveling through space and time. Finding companions to help him in his quests which were all basically created by his ever creative subconscious. The lonely Doctor, trying to forget the war and the destruction, trying to forget the trauma of the Time War, Trying to forget.

It has been shown in the latest episode that the TARDIS can act as a holodeck of sorts. What if the Doctor, trapped himself in his holodeck and threw away the key.


Now what could the key be? 


My guess is that the key is his name. His name will unlock the TARDIS and reveal that he has been living in a false reality for many years.

He has been hiding his name for the very purpose of not escaping his false reality and as this season has progressed it has seemed that very soon his name may be revealed. With this accelerated push toward reality, it makes sense that his subconscious could be creating Clara as the companion who shouldn't be. Or it could be a creation of the TARDIS trying to get the Doctor to snap out of it. 

All in all, the Doctor's adventures are all a figment of his imagination. After all, he escapes death and the end of the world several times. I guess it still could be explained with the Wibbley Wobbley Timey Wimey answer, and indeed it might be just that but in his mind.

So when they were forcing their way from the pocket universe to back to theirs the soul got caught in the time vortex and scattered throughout different timelines as the same person. This would be why she says the line “It’s smaller on the outside” because she’s never seen it from the outside before. Also it would explain why the TARDIS doesn’t like her, because she’s jealous of Clara. When the TARDIS was in human form she said that she stole the Doctor and that he was hers. Human companions were one thing but someone with the soul of a TARDIS would be competition for her.

The thing is the cheapest room at the uni I'm going to is £121.00 a week, after 40 weeks that becomes £4840. With the £500 something that's left over I've got to pay for books, food, a bit of drink and any other expenditures how on earth will I be able to do that? Surely I'm missing something here this seems crazy. I got the grades for a £1k scholarship so that should help out but come on, this seems mad. 

Would anyone currently staying out at uni be able give me some info on this, if this is right or if in the calculator I've entered in something wrong?

Funny how that works, isn't it?  

Why does the Doctor have a preferred hangout in a specific place that moves slowly forward in time?  We know from the early episodes of Doctor Who that the Doctor and Susan had many adventures prior to An Unearthly Child, but that he and Susan stayed in England in 1963 for about six months before the beginning of the first episode.  

The reason for this is that the the Doctor's wild adventuring ways were having too negative of an effect on a young impressionable Gallifreyan girl. Gallifreyan children, of course, grow up at the same rate as human children.  Susan was rapidly growing up with only her grandfather as a parental figure, having lost her parents or contact with her parents under unclear circumstances.  So the Doctor decided to pick somewhere to settle down and raise his granddaughter.  The First Doctor, being a stodgy old-fashioned fellow, wanted a place and time for his granddaughter to grow up 'properly', without being exposed to too much vulgar sexuality or violence, while at the same time being a fun and interesting period that didn't oppress young girls either.  So, he chose 1963 in England.  A safe bet.  Rock and Roll and the Beatles were around, but not too wild (yet), English society was relatively safe and the early 60s were interesting enough to keep a young, curious girl like Susan engaged.  By the time the wildness of the late 60s and early 70s rolled around, Susan would be grown and she and the Doctor would be back to adventuring around the universe.

Of course, it didn't work like that.  The Doctor lost Susan, and his best link back to her was the time and place where Susan briefly spent her adolescence with her grandfather, at her happiest and most content.  So no matter where he traveled, he kept going back to England in the early 1960s, and kept finding young female companions to travel with, trying on some level to replace what he'd lost.  But every time he returned to the 60s, the Doctor had to keep moving forward in time to avoid running into himself, and he'd occasionally overshoot his mark by a few weeks or months.  Eventually, the 60s became the 70s, and so on. As the decades ticked by and centuries of personal time passed, links to Susan faded and so the Doctor began to adopt this period of Earth history as a replacement for his lost homeworld and family.  His relationships with his companions finally began to evolve as well.

In between traveling to other places and times across the universe, the Doctor keeps on returning to the same place and continuous timeline because it provides him with a sense of familiarity and security.  A place even the Doctor can call home, which started off long ago as a link to his lost granddaughter.

I took a job in Cambridge, but I'm feeling a little disoriented and could use some help.

I'll be working at what Google Maps calls the ""West Cambridge Site"", near the intersection of M11 and A1303.  I have a family (wife and toddler), and they're coming with me.  I don't plan on having a car - we'll probably just bike and use public transport.  A couple questions/requests:

What are my options for good, family friendly housing in that area?  What neighborhoods should I avoid in my search?

I'm honestly concerned about the cost of living.  Housing in particular is very expensive.  Will we be okay with a take-home pay of £1800 ppm?  We're okay on that now, but we're not paying nearly as much for housing (though we're paying a lot towards gas, car insurance, etc.  We won't have car-based expenses.)  I've known other families who have managed on that amount, but I'm nervous that it won't be enough.

This is a problem I've only just discovered today.

 

I've tried to download some items via private trackers using both uTorrent and BitTorrent and I am experiencing extremely slow download speeds and difficulty connecting to peers.

 

Usually with the private trackers I get between 500kbps and 700kbps. Today I've been struggling to get 3kbps and so far it's taken 6 hours to download 20% of a 300mb file.

 

I've spoken to others using the same private trackers and they are experiencing no issues. My broadband speed for general web browsing and downloading of files has not been affected. The only problem I'm having is with the torrent software and downloading items from there.

 

The only conclusion I can come to is that there is an issue with my ISP and the use of torrenting software and anything connected.

 

Can anyone confirm if this is the case? Are any other BT customers experiencing any issues?

That's it, one good sentimental scene at the end in the engine room and that's that? He's only worried about finding Clara, not that his ship is dying. The TARDIS is the single permanent thing in the Doctor's long life and he let some stranger start ripping apart the main console without a second glance or an angry word.

Is there anything else we can do to encourage Unionists to change their mind? Can we encourage some Protestant Churches to switch sides or take a neutral view?
I think the Catholic Church provides a lot of cover for Unionists to claim they are representing the entire community in blocking the Bill but getting that Church to change its mind could be beyond our means.

Does anyone have any ideas on how we can put pressure on the assembly to go the right way on this?

For example, the last episode Journey to the Centre of the TARDIS had great potential, but the ending was a huge cop out. Never mind that the main plot was essentially already used in Fathers Day in season 1. They build these great stores then basically finish them off horribly, in my opinion. They keep using the same ending ""rewrite time"" or ""wibbly wobbly"", Moffatt was great for single episodes (Blink, Doctor Dances ect) but these season long stories are awful. Another example was how Rivers story was ruined, I felt having her be a companions daughter was a bit lame and now they're trying to make up for it with Clara who is essentially the same basic idea. 

Am I alone in this or do you guys agree? To further voice my frustrations, if they actually name the Doctor, I'm done with the show.

The Doctor has said that his name is unpronounceable.
We know that The Doctor lies.

Based on the above we can say that we are already aware of the Doctor's name, it has been used relatively frequently (for it to be in  plain sight) and it will in some way be shocking.

This has made me think could The Doctor have become another character that we are familiar with (and I don't mean random man in market place).

Thinking back to The Waters of Mars when the Doctor thinks he has changed the fixed point he takes on the persona of 'The Timelord Victorious', a person who is able to manipulate time to his benefit with regard only for himself.  As we know this didn't work out for him but it gave us a glimpse into what the Doctor desires.

So who do we know who will do anything to get things their way including manipulating time and having no regard for any one else.

The Master? I don't think so.

What would happen if The Doctor was unable to regenerate? He wouldn't die, just get really old and small (The Sound of Drums), and if he had been fobwatched as well he would have no idea who he was.  Perhaps he would take on a human identity. Perhaps he'd call himself David, David Ross, or maybe Dave Ross which could easily become Davros!

What if The Doctor made the TARDIS explode by accident. After the Ponds make their heartbreaking exit, The Doctor reads Amy's 'letter' and goes to visit her while she waits, right?

Well what if he couldn't resist the temptation to try again? What if he actually picked her up as a seven year old and took her away? 

She wouldn't fall in love with Rory and vitally they wouldn't marry. Everything would be fine up until the date of their 'wedding day' (the date of the explosion) when they supposedly conceived River.

If River was never conceived then she couldn't have died in the library, so who would have instead? The Doctor. But if he died back then, what the hell would happen to time? Because its a hell of a paradox for him to be picking up Amy in his Eleventh form when he died as Ten.

And it would all go wrong on the day that River was supposed to be created. Hmm.. 

I realise this can not happen because the Ponds are gone for good and there is much Timey Wimey stuff that gets in the way, but it occurred to me this morning and I found it fascinating so I thought I'd share.

Had this following Doctor Whoish dream. 

     I find myself on an island with the guys from Broken Lizard (Beer Fest guys) and we are acting like we've been there before. There is a hatch in the ground and I walk up to it and turn the wheel, open the hatch, and climb inside. We have a pretty decent party set up down there, but there are only a few rooms. As a bunch of party guys we've kept the place pretty dirty. Lots of beer around, lots of weed, lots of dust and shit that's piled up over the years. Its been a great freakin time down there. This was a dream obviously, but I could feel the party happening. I could touch the chairs, the poker chips; I could feel the beer as I drank it. Every sense was being used in this dream and it was a blast. At this point we have left the island, for reasons I didn't know. We end up on this building that at the time seemed like a ship. This part of the dream is the only part that is rather fuzzy but the key points were that we were rescuing orphans from this building that was on a ship. I had tricked the man in charge who ran away with the orphan we had to rescue into a helicopter, which took off. This is where the fun starts. 
     I smile as the helicopter takes off, a kind of sly smile that means I know I have this in the bag. I look down at my wrist and punch coordinates into my Vortex Manipulator (ala Jack Harkness) and lights begin to spin around me. As the lights fade I find myself on the helicopter facing the man who stole the orphan. ""Hello, friend,"" I say as the man looks at me with disbelief. I open up the door to the cockpit of this military helicopter and to the continued disbelief of the man who stole the orphan the man piloting said helicopter is one of the guys from the island. 
     The man shoots my friend in the head and the helicopter begins to fall hard, as the bullet went through my friend's head and into the console of our vehicle. We're going down. In a last ditch effort to save the rest of us I flip a switch on my wristband and we're surround again by bright swirling lights. I come to, dizzy and confused, in a large field of wet grass, surrounded by trees and darkness. I realized that I'm once again on the island from the beginning of the dream. Along with the dampness of the grass and the chillness of the wind I feel an overwhelming sense of dread. The man and the orphan are gone, but the wreckage of the helicopter are behind me. I get to my feet and start walking towards the other end of the field, where the hatch to the party bunker is. As I'm running I look up in horror to see a massive spider running through the treetops. A spider the size of a house moving so fast that it boggles the mind. I get to the bunker before the spider notices me, thinking I'm safe. I was wrong. As I enter the party bunker I see the rest of the Broken Lizard squad surrounding a massive hole. They tell me that the massive spider outside had broken through the ground and come out of the hole and then escaped by breaking through a wall at the other side of the bunker. So far we're not experiencing anything timey whimey but I get the sense that there is something down the hole that would explain what is going on. I jump down, as any sane man would do, and find myself in the ballroom of a deserted mansion. Tables lining the walls of the mansion are covered with silverware caked in dust and worn from time. (At this point for reasons unknown I find that a lot of my friends from real life are here which confused me so I'll skip that part). 
     I notice skittering along the walls and in the windows, windows that don't make sense because technically we're underground. Or I at least assume we're underground. Suddenly an army of spiders, smaller than the original, possibly the size of queen sized beds, start running at me and my friends, sending us into a frightened frenzy trying to avoid these creatures. I climb up a bookcase to avoid a set of three spiders, who smell of death, whose eyes were black and wet, fangs clawing at me. And holy shit the hissing was messed up. This was supposed to be a dream and got too real. Now this is where the Doctor Who shit comes outs.
     Jumping from the top of the bookcase to the ceiling lights I swing over the room, from chandelier to chandelier, but on the last one I lose my grip and fly through the wall, decaying wood flying everywhere. I pull out a piece of wood from my leg and struggle to stand. When I'm on my feet I look around and I'm in yet another massive room, possibly a foyer or some open meeting place that was miles long in each direction. I see a man standing in a doorway about 50 feet in front of me, partially hidden by the door. He was a disheveled old man in rags. He raised his arm at me and motioned for me to follow him, using his bony finger to call me hither. I stumble over towards him, and as I get close, with speed that did not match his age, he closes the door after he flees behind it. I go to the door and open it slowly. I could sense ... evil, coming from the door and as I looked in all I saw was the top of a set of stairs and then darkness. Noises emanated from the darkness, howls and whines and cries of terror and pain and warm breeze that smelled of blood. I swing the door shut in a terror I've never felt before. 
     Immediately upon shutting the door the room I'm in is suddenly filled with hundreds upon hundreds of people in what seemed to be a massive market of sorts. I scream for the Doctor as try to avoid the creatures and people who are in the middle of this market, filled with thousands of bright colors, cloth hanging from the ceiling where tiny humanoids circle and fly around. A tiny elderly woman, grotesque from age begins to yell at me in a language I can't understand. I run back to where I fell through the wall only to find a wall with no structural damage at all. The Doctor appears behind me and grabs me by the arm, bringing be back towards the door to the basement. He explains to me that everyone in this room is a being trapped in time and space, forever locked in this building. The hole I fell through that the spider had emerged from was a wormhole created by the creature (old man) in the basement. Everyone in here had accepted their fate and formed a massive community because there was no escape. The Doctor then turned me as we stood in front of the door and asked me, ""We can face the creature and destroy this evil so no one will ever be trapped in this mansion of evil ever again, but the consequence would be sending every living being in this mansion back to their original time and space. However some of them have been here so long, going back to their world after never aging a day, some of them would go back to completely different situations than the ones before them, leaving them with destroyed lives."" The Doctor looks me in the eye, sternly nodding, giving me the choice. I turn back towards the door and put my hand on the knob.

I get to my feet and start walking towards the other end of the field, where the hatch to the party bunker is. As I'm running I look up in horror to see a massive spider running through the treetops. A spider the size of a house moving so fast that it boggles the mind. I get to the bunker before the spider notices me, thinking I'm safe. I was wrong. As I enter the party bunker I see the rest of the Broken Lizard squad surrounding a massive hole. They tell me that the massive spider outside had broken through the ground and come out of the hole and then escaped by breaking through a wall at the other side of the bunker. So far we're not experiencing anything timey whimey but I get the sense that there is something down the hole that would explain what is going on. I jump down, as any sane man would do, and find myself in the ballroom of a deserted mansion. Tables lining the walls of the mansion are covered with silverware caked in dust and worn from time. (At this point for reasons unknown I find that a lot of my friends from real life are here which confused me so I'll skip that part). 
      
I notice skittering along the walls and in the windows, windows that don't make sense because technically we're underground. Or I at least assume we're underground. Suddenly an army of spiders, smaller than the original, possibly the size of queen sized beds, start running at me and my friends, sending us into a frightened frenzy trying to avoid these creatures. I climb up a bookcase to avoid a set of three spiders, who smell of death, whose eyes were black and wet, fangs clawing at me. And holy shit the hissing was messed up. This was supposed to be a dream and got too real. Now this is where the Doctor Who shit comes outs.

 Jumping from the top of the bookcase to the ceiling lights I swing over the room, from chandelier to chandelier, but on the last one I lose my grip and fly through the wall, decaying wood flying everywhere. I pull out a piece of wood from my leg and struggle to stand. When I'm on my feet I look around and I'm in yet another massive room, possibly a foyer or some open meeting place that was miles long in each direction. I see a man standing in a doorway about 50 feet in front of me, partially hidden by the door. He was a disheveled old man in rags. He raised his arm at me and motioned for me to follow him, using his bony finger to call me hither. I stumble over towards him, and as I get close, with speed that did not match his age, he closes the door after he flees behind it. I go to the door and open it slowly. I could sense ... evil, coming from the door and as I looked in all I saw was the top of a set of stairs and then darkness. Noises emanated from the darkness, howls and whines and cries of terror and pain and warm breeze that smelled of blood. I swing the door shut in a terror I've never felt before. 
      
Immediately upon shutting the door the room I'm in is suddenly filled with hundreds upon hundreds of people in what seemed to be a massive market of sorts. I scream for the Doctor as try to avoid the creatures and people who are in the middle of this market, filled with thousands of bright colors, cloth hanging from the ceiling where tiny humanoids circle and fly around. A tiny elderly woman, grotesque from age begins to yell at me in a language I can't understand. I run back to where I fell through the wall only to find a wall with no structural damage at all. The Doctor appears behind me and grabs me by the arm, bringing be back towards the door to the basement. He explains to me that everyone in this room is a being trapped in time and space, forever locked in this building. The hole I fell through that the spider had emerged from was a wormhole created by the creature (old man) in the basement. Everyone in here had accepted their fate and formed a massive community because there was no escape. The Doctor then turned me as we stood in front of the door and asked me, ""We can face the creature and destroy this evil so no one will ever be trapped in this mansion of evil ever again, but the consequence would be sending every living being in this mansion back to their original time and space. However some of them have been here so long, going back to their world after never aging a day, some of them would go back to completely different situations than the ones before them, leaving them with destroyed lives."" The Doctor looks me in the eye, sternly nodding, giving me the choice. I turn back towards the door and put my hand on the knob. 
    
     Then I woke up.

What if the doctor’s real name is actually “Yahweh” and he is in fact the Christian God. I am not claiming that he is omnipotent or the creator of the universe, merely the creator of humans.

The Doctor stole the TARDIS (AKA Eden) and created humans in his own image to live in it. This would also explain why the Doctor looks like he is a human as well as why he has the TARDIS have infinite rooms, almost all of which have earthlike looking rooms. However he cast them out of the TARDIS when they ate the forbidden fruit (Stealing the circuit things from the newest episode).

Not only does it cover how he appears human but also why he has such an obsession with humanity. He always admires there survivalist nature (That he created) and would explain why he always seems to choose a human as a companion. The doctor in many episodes even protects humanity and claims to be always watching out for them (Acting as there savior). In one episode the doctor protects a group of humans even from what is supposed to be the devil himself.

My VW lupo was making a grinding noise when I pressed the clutch in, took is to a garage who told us it was very likely going to be the clutch release bearing. Took it in, going to cost £80 plus labor to take everything out including the gearbox etc etc totalling about  £280.

 Got a call the next day, it was not the release bearing, turns out (my mechanical knowledge is limited here, my dad has been dealing with a lot of this so far) a bracket that is near the gearbox has fragmented into three pieces and some of the metal went into a spline that was inside/connected to the gearbox and it has ruined its teeth damaging both parts quite badly. Gonne cost an extra £250 to get another gearbox. Okay, not happy here unexpected costs. 

Dad went to pick it back up today, could not move it into 1st gear very easily and was making a strange “tapping” noise when it was in any gear besides 1st. He took it back and the garage agreed to look into it tomorrow morning. 
Worst case, the gearbox they fitted is duff, and they have to get another one which will be added to the bill + labor.

That is insane, and I doubt they will try it, but if they DO, what laws are on my side here? Because this isn’t a mechanical failure, it is not something I have done, the guys at the garage has fucked up something.

I didn't include episodes that took place in the present time as it cluttered up the timeline and didn't really involve any travel. 

The future timeline doesn't really look like a timeline because the year 100 trillion (featured in ""Utopia"") is ridiculously far apart from the previous date 5 billion.

I'm really happy when I see him play, and I think he's outstanding. 

Now. In nearly every MotM thread, people CJ on Holtby. In wish list lineups, Holtby is often the 12th man/first sub. Holtby is our hero, and that's great. 

On the other hand, Dempsey is rarely mentioned unless he's the far and away obvious MotM (Manchester U, Basel round 2.) He's not often in dream line ups, and he's rarely mentioned as a powerful sub in them either. 

However, if Dempsey went the length of time without a goal, assist, or even a shot on frame that Holtby does he'd be called for a transfer. Why? 

The facts are that Dempsey is our third scoring leader across all apps, behind Bale and Defoe. He's 4 ahead of Super Jan who is 1 in front of Gylfi, if that helps put perspective. (I also feel like Gylfi gets left out an improper amount as well, but he gets his love too.) It's Bale (24), Defoe (15), Demps (11), Vertonghen (7), and Gylfi (6). Holtby only has 15 apps, but he also has 0 scoring creations. 

Scoring isn't everything, but when you're goal differential is less than half  of your rivals', it's pretty important to keep what you have. 

Holtby is awesome, but he's also the definition of FRAAB right now. Why the hard love for number 2? Is it the pay grade or age?

**TL;DR** - Statistically, Dempsey is one of our elite. Why the tough love?

So my friend is a newcastle fan, began talking to be about how 4 or 5 Newcastle players would walk into our team. I argued maybe one or two, and that'd be the bench. 

He basically said hypothetically, the starting team would be

1.Krul
2. Johnson
3. Coloccini
4. Agger
5. Santon (lol)
6. HBA (arguably..)
7. Cabeye (Lol) 
8. Lucas
9. Coutinho
10. Sturridge
11. Suarez

I agreed maybe Coloccini and Krul (maybeeee) for lack of better options, I also laughed in his face about Santon over Jose. 

What do you guys think? My friend is very determined about this

During this time our landlords have issued an eviction notice, which goes to court in 2 weeks time, she has also picked up a CCJ as she couldn't pay the water rates bill.
We have tried to scrape together enough cash to put down a deposit on a cheap place, but due to my mums bad credit history we are undesirable tenants and unable to pass the required credit checks - We are apparently not able to get help from the council as we have 'technically' made ourselves homeless by not paying rent...
We have no family to turn to, and when the bailiffs turn up in a few weeks time to remove us from the property I have no idea where we can go.
The Student Loans Company is entirely to blame for this situation, and has been promising my mum the money she is entitled to for months, offering a new story every time she phones. I have sent emails and letters to the local MP without any acknowledgement.

If Azza is fit he should start, as we need width against sides like that, as evidenced by our stale play at Wigan. Holtby vs Dempsey is dependant on who AVB chooses for the Chelsea match. 

Against Chelsea at Stamford, I'd like to see us use the 433 that worked against Man City. Chelsea also uses a narrow 4231 and the 433 with one CM behind the other two is the idea counter to that. Hopefully Ade is back for this one; he should start up top, with Defoe coming on against tired legs. Azza should be on the bench also to come late on. Bale and Demspey/Siggy should start on the wings. Parker should play holding mid behind Dembélé and Holtby/Siggy depending on who between Holtby and Dempsey start.

I believe.... that Clara.... is somehow related to Susan, the Doctors granddaughter from the very first Doctor...

EVIDENCE TO SUPORT THIS CLAIM:
So far in series 7, they've mentioned a lot about past series. [The first place he took Clara was somewhere he used to go with Susan. In 'Journey To The Center of the TARDIS' we see a lot of stuff from the Doctors past (i.e. the crib, little toys and knick knacks, the voices heard under the TARDIS console)](/spolier). I think it's all pointing that something from his past, waaay in the past, is coming back.

Also, we never really find out what happens to Susan. [We know the Doctor lets her go live with the human she's in love with, and he tells her that 'one day, I shall see you again. Yes, one day.' but after that we never see her again.](/spoiler) Did she die? Did she regenerate? Did she have kids? The Doctor does say that all the Time Lords are dead, but we all know what Rule One is: The Doctor Always Lies. He might now know what has happened to her, or maybe he cut off all contact with her to keep her safe. 

I'm not saying that Clara IS Susan (though that might be true as well), but I think that she might be in some way related to her. Something about her is made up of the same timey wimey stuff that the Doctor is made of, and they are drawn to each other because of it. :)",false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,null,null,default,My Theory on Clara...,1,http://www.reddit.com/r/doctorwho/comments/1dgc2r/my_theory_on_clara/

I believe that Clara is Rose's grandaughter. (At least the one living 20-21st century) During the prequel of bells of saint john, young clara list the things shes lost. One of these is her gran. Now this could just be assumed as death, but I think that ""lose"" means that her gran actually left the universe for an alternate one. Also, to back this up, Clara has a lot of connections to Rose. She always wears red/roses, her mother died the same day 9 met rose, clara's father was almost hit by the same car rose's dad was. After watching journy to the centre of the Tardis, I saw that clara read the Gallefreyan time war book? How? The TARDIS doesn't translate that stuff. Maybe she has a bit of Time lord in her? I think clara's mother (Ellie Oswald) is the daughter of the human-10 and Rose. I believe that 50th witll take place around sep 1960 (clara's mum's birth) and in the episode Ellie Oswald will be born. Billie and David are already confirmed for the 50th. so... yea.

Mou went unbeaten in 150 consecutive home games, from 2002 to 2011 with 4 different teams.

If Madrid finish runner ups this year, it will be the 11th consecutive time a team under Mou's reins has finished in the top 2 of the league.

Since 2002, Mou has not gone a full calender year without winning a trophy.

Thought to be an unsuccessful era in Real Madrid, Mou's win percentage was 72.7% and his Real's GD was +301 goals, highest in all his career.

Mou led Real Madrid to the Liga title for the first time in four seasons in 2011-12, and during the campaign they broke a number of domestic records. Their 100 points was the highest ever tally, as was the 121 goals they scored. Their positive goal difference of 89 was also a new high, along with their 16 away wins and 32 overall wins. 

Mou won the inaugural Ballon d'Or Best Coach award in 2010. 

In 2009-10 during his second season at Inter, Mourinho let the San Siro side to the first Italian treble of Serie A, the Coppa Italia and the Champions League. It was also the first time Inter had won the European Cup since 1965. 

Mourinho speaks Portuguese, Spanish, Italian, French, English and Catalan

Mourinho's Spanish Supercopa victory in 2012 made him the first man to win the national Super Cup in four different countries. 

I know most of these facts are known, but still, reading them altogether just blows my fucking mind!!

I think we could make some transfers but not huge ones.

Assuming that Mourinho returns, there's a good chance that we will still be running a 4-2-3-1 and this is how I'd like to see us line up next year.

GK - **Cech**      
*He's not going anywhere just yet, I think a loan to a premier league club would be a good move. Maybe Swansea if Vorm leaves. I also think that we could run Jamaal Blackman as backup keeper, from what I've seen in the nextgen series he'd do the job.*

DEF - **Azpilicueta** - **Cahill** - **Luiz** - **Cole**        
*Azpilicueta has settled into the RB spot extremely well and has recently been called up the Spanish national team so the sky's the limit for him, Cahill has been decent but I still think he's got a long way to go if he's going to be JT's successor, David Luiz on the other hand is the guy I see staying with us forever and captaining the team once JT leaves, Cole will no doubt be our left back next season or else we wouldn't have renewed his contract. I think that Ivanovic Nathanial Ake and a purchase of Luke Shaw from Southampton will be good cover to rotate the squad around.*

C-MID **Ramires** - **Victor Wanyama**     
*I think that Wanyama would be the dominant force in midfield that we are missing, he's a big lad at 6""2 and I think would act well as a Yaya Toure kind of player, Ramires would act extremely well as the link between defence and attack as he is fast, has good vision and is composed on the ball. We could rotate John Obi Mikel and Oriol Romeu to give the others a rest*

A-MID **Juan Mata** - **Eden Hazard** - **Oscar**
*This would be the ideal situation for big games, obviously there will be some rotation.(hopefully not as often as rafa) There's not really all that much you can say about the three amigos, they're just getting better and better, their link up play is becoming and amazing and hopefully we can cement them in our lineup for many many years to come.*

STR - **Romelu Lukaku**
*14 goals and 3 assists playing for West Bromwich at 19 years old, the idea of him playing in front of Hazard, Mata and Oscar is frightening. I also think we can rest him and play Torres who has been doing better from the bench than in the starting lineup.*


Cech
Azpilicueta - Cahill - Luiz - Cole
Wanyama - Ramires
Mata - Hazard - Oscar
Lukaku

Blackman
Ivanovic
Terry
Mikel
Moses
De Bruyne
Torres


I think we'll sell Ba, I think he was brought in to do a job for the season and we'll let him go, similar to what we did with Meireles.
Same with Marin, I think he'll be sold of loaned because he's not breaking into the first team any time soon.
I think Malouda, Ferreira, Hilario, Turnbull, Benayoun and Lampard will all have their contracts run out. Lampard is the only one that I'm sad about.

I think Shaw and Wanyama we could get for about 8-12 each and they would work out really well for the club long term.

Some of my friends claim that you get turned into an Angel. But I don't agree.

In S05E04 ""The Time of Angels"" this happens:

the Doctor warns Amy not to look directly into the eyes of the Angel because the book compared eyes to the doors of the soul and the Angels may enter there. Amy is able to turn off the image on a loop break, causing the Angel to disappear and saving herself. As they head toward the crashed ship, Amy continually feels that something is in her eye.

and then this:

Amy believes that she cannot move because her hand has become stone and she cannot release its grip on the wall of the cave. The Doctor explains that her perception has been influenced by the Angel through her direct eye contact, and she is still fine; he proves it by biting her hand, which allows her to flee.

(Source: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Time_of_Angels)

From this my conclusion is that Amy THINKS she is becoming an angel but she is not ACTUALLY becoming one.

He's even created an incredibly accurate 5th season matt smith cosplay for sandiego comicon this year and has a quite impressive collection of sonic screwdrivers that he's modded himself.

My original idea was to invite him over, insist he wears his cosplay and greet him dressed as river song, also from season 5 (specifically the big bang episode, season finale) However, I have 5 days to do this and cannot afford to spend a fortune on this date &gt;.&lt;

Words cannot express how annoyed I am right now. So much of the SLC loan was not explained to me all those years ago but written in the small print. It's digusting how they know they can write what they like within the small print because students are young and mostly dumb.

Google recently enabled their Map Maker for the UK. I have been waiting for this for quite some time now as I hate how some things are wrong on the service (University Of Ulster Coleraine being labelled as Magee for quite some time). While travelling I have always been quite envious of the info available for other places, so the opportunity to fix our map really intrigues me.

Considering that we are a small nation/country/province I think if we pooled our knowledge together we could greatly improve the coverage and accuracy of NI. With the prevalence of Google Maps now and future applications (Google Now and Glass) improving the data here will be beneficial for us as locals but also those visiting our wee country.

So yeah, if you walk your dog round Victoria Park or know Botanic Gardens like the back of your hand why not add some details to the map. It will help someone somewhere.

**[Tax](http://www.ukip.org/content/ukip-policies/2993-ukip-proposed-tax-policy)**

*""18 pence in the pound goes on servicing government debt.""* - this is totally untrue - expenditure is 3% of GDP or 6% of public sector spending. Sources [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom_national_debt) and [here](http://www.economicshelp.org/blog/6848/economics/cost-of-servicing-debt/)

*""The coalition boasts it has cut the annual deficit by 25%,  yet any school boy with a calculator can work out to reduce national debt the reduction needs to be 125% otherwise it continues to grow.""* - this is confusing and hilarious. A 100% reduction would balance the books, and lead to no debt in the long run. Significantly less than a 100% reduction in deficit would still see a reduction in debt (so long as it was lower than the historic deficit average).

*""Historically, time and again, it has been proven that reduction in tax rates boosts the economy and paradoxically does not reduce the tax take.""* - that's an improbable theory at best, see [here](http://www.businessinsider.com/study-tax-cuts-dont-lead-to-growth-2012-9), [or here](http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2012/10/does-taxing-the-wealthy-hurt-growth.html), [or indeed here](http://www.forbes.com/sites/leonardburman/2012/03/15/capital-gains-tax-rates-and-economic-growth-or-not/).

*""The earnings of employed people are not a legitimate target for taxation""* - they are also, one way or another, the *only* target for taxation (well, apart from inheritance tax - which they want to abolish - and corporation tax -which they want to slash).

**[Defence](http://www.ukip.org/content/ukip-policies/3040-ukip-defence-position)**

Despite their aforementioned plans to reduce the deficit and slash taxes, they're in favour of bolstering military spending. Their basis for this is a Cold War remark on security from Thatcher, and so we can be ""proud""

**[Same sex marriage](http://www.ukip.org/content/ukip-policies/2863-ukip-response-to-the-governments-consultation-on-samesex-marriage)**

They're against same-sex marriage because they don't want religions to be forced to marry homosexual couples (which they won't be), they don't want the government to interfere in marriage (which preventing homosexual marriage is), and ""there's no reason to"". This argument has been done to death already, but their policy remains absurd.

[**Energy**](http://www.ukip.org/content/ukip-policies/2772-keeping-the-lights-on)

Essentially, bog standard climate change denialism.

*""More and more scientists are challenging the conventional wisdom on Global
Warming.""* [Not true](http://www.skepticalscience.com/global-warming-scientific-consensus-intermediate.htm). In fact, all of their arguments can be debunked by that same website, so I'll only do one more.

*""The slight warming in the last hundred years is entirely consistent with well-
established, long-term natural climate cycles — the Roman Optimum, the Dark
Ages, the Mediæval Warm Period, the Little Ice Age. And now we seem to be
moving into a new, natural 21st century optimum""* - also [widely debunked](http://www.skepticalscience.com/climate-change-little-ice-age-medieval-warm-period-intermediate.htm).

*""We do not however regard CO 2 as a pollutant. It is a natural trace gas in the atmosphere which is essential to plant growth and life on earth. ""* LOL

[**Anti-ECHR Stance**](http://www.ukip.org/content/latest-news/2593-pm-blustering-on-echr-to-no-avail)

I've already ranted on this, but this is a brief list of instances in which the ECHR has held the government to account when British courts and laws were insufficient:-

* Requiring that when somebody is killed by the state there must be a proper independent investigation, and that armed personnel should be trained properly (McCann et al v UK)
* Preventing the government informing paramilitaries they know will kill someone of that individual's location, to execute by proxy (Shaghan v UK)
* You can't put an ethnic individual in a cell with a racist offender and take bets on how long he'll last (he died) (R on the application of Amin v SSHD)
* It led to safeguards and legal standards for wiretapping (Malone v UK)
* You can't ""interrogate"" prisoners by forcing them into certain positions or depriving them of light and sound (Ireland v UK)
* The legalisation of homosexuality in Northern Ireland (Dudgeon v UK)
* Stopping contempt of court from infringing on freedom of the press (Sunday Times v UK)
* The mentally ill who voluntarily commit themselves to an institution are owed the same duty - suicide watch etc - as those who are sectioned (Rabone v Pennine Care)
* Ensuring that existing prisoners still get access to solicitors (Golder v UK)
* Ensuring that workers maintain rights to join trade unions (Wilson v UK)
* Giving the police an obligation to act if somebody is being dangerously stalked (Osman v UK)
* Preventing indefinite detention under the declaration of a national emergency (A v SOS for the Home Dept).
* Preventing public birching of children by the police in the Isle of Man (Tyrer v UK)

I think Clara Oswald might not be real, The Doctor is imagining her.

A few other characters do talk to her, so that takes some credit away from my theory. But perhaps the viewer is being shown things as The Doctor sees them, to enable this kind of suspense, and when people are talking to Clara they're really talking to The Doctor.

I need to go back and re-watch some scenes from when she first appeared (Asylum of the Daleks, Snowman) and the recent episode, Journey to the Center of the Tardis. Just to make sure I'm remembering things right.

In Journey to the Center of the Tardis, I'm pretty sure the salvagers never speak to Clara at all. In fact, they don't seem to understand why The Doctor is going on about saving this girl. And when he finds her in Bells of Saint John, she doesn't seem to have a family or connections at all. ~~She says she looks after some kids, who are never shown.~~ EDIT: I was wrong, the kids are shown briefly

As for The Doctor going around talking to an imaginary companion - well he behaves oddly all the time. It really wouldn't be too odd for his manic personality to go around carrying on conversations with himself.

Is The Doctor going crazy?

The idea will mostly likely become a campsite trip - however I thought It'd be grand if we could organise our own mini londonsocialclub festival (for those that are missing EXIT and Glasto etc) - albeit, sat around a campfire with a guitar and board-games.... 


We're adept at putting on a good show in London, and I'd like to take some of us outside the boundaries of the M25 - preferably within an hour or so's train ride to a field so we don't need to be quiet after 11pm.



We'd respect all local rules and work out food/sanitary logistics once a location has been found.


So, may I ask redditors of the United Kingdom with fields to come forward:
Can we come to your field to have a campfire, sing songs, play cards-against-humanity and (most likely) experience fish-out-of-water hilarity from the city-folk (not me, I've done lots of camping).

Cheers!




Some seriousnesses here:

I can provide references from IRL and established redditors that I'm not a loony and would keep health-safety in mind and would actually plan this thing sensibly.

The event would be facebook coordinated and not open to randoms - probably 'core' LSC members and verified IRL friends only. I wouldn't expect more than 30 people would actually sign-up and come along. 

You'd be kept informed of any progress/ideas we had, and obviously welcome to join / camp with us also. 

I'd say the average age would be around 30, most of us are employed professionals (mostly foreign new-to-Londoners and people in IT/programming/tech, it seems).

PM me if you have somewhere but don't want to post your location. 
I can reply via email if you'd prefer. 

I'd recommend a couple of us come to visit beforehand so we can see the field/area and meet face to face.

Finally, if you thought it was no longer a good idea it'll be okay to pull out and we'd revert to the campsite idea. No worries. 

Thanks!

We also saw in the most recent episode that TARDISes can malfunction and act strangely. This would be what allows her to appear in the ways that she does. The Chameleon Circuit would disguise her in a way that she would relate to the time period; i.e., her memories being different. We also saw that TARDISes can harbor memories.

But then we came to a question in our discussion: whose TARDIS is it? Who would have a TARDIS other than the Doctor?

I have never watched any of the older versions (prob should), so maybe this is why I feel like the eleventh doctor just isn’t that great.  My fav doctor was the tenth; he had the perfect mix of seriousness, being high-strung, and not over exaggerating everything.  I actually liked the 9th doctor A LOT and I wish he could have stayed on for another season or 2, but not to upset since David came over.  


Now don’t get me wrong, I think Matt plays the role of the doctor “well”, but he is super erratic, high-strung (to the point where he annoys me personally sometimes while watching), and over exaggerates everything.  I understand the personality of the doctor needs to be this way because he has the whole of the universe etc. in his head, but I just wish he played it out more like the 10th and 9th doctor.  He’s by far not “bad”, but in all honesty out of the 3 he’s my least favorite.


Does anyone here feel the same way, or am I just not grasping something about the show that I should and the other doctors (9&amp;10) were missing?  Also, for the people who have watched the series from the beginning, how do you feel doctors 1-8 compare to 11 and to 9&amp;10?

What do you hope/expect to happen? What do you want to avoid if at all possible. 

City will likely loose Tevez this summer, what with his contract out in one year, and our desire to make some money off of his sale for FFP. Dzeko's likely gone too, which leaves our most glaring shortcoming in the realm of strikers. Cavani's name has been mentioned more than a few times, as has Jovetic's. Less likely, but no less talked about is Falcao. There was some word of trading Aguero for either Higuain or Benzema, though I personally doubt that. I think we'd all love to see more of Guidetti. Do you think Mancini will give him a chamnce to prove himself, now that the games are less important? Do you think he'll be able to win a spot at the table? What's everyone hope/expect to see happen with our strikers?

In addition to strikers we could use another top quality play maker, and if Nasri leaves, it might do to make that two. It looks like Reus could be headed our way, which would be great as he can play as either a creative player or a striker, and generally something of a combination of the two. This makes him ideal for the end of an attacking three, but he could also play creatively behind that, or behind the central striker as a number 10 or CAM of sorts. Isco has also been rumored, which I'd love to see come true as he's been called the next Iniesta by some. He'd likely fit on the left side of the midfield, but could play centrally in the midfield or on the wings in an attack, though Reus would likely be better at this. Erik Lamela, who would play in the same sort of role as Reus, has also been mentioned. Christian Erikson has indicated an interest in coming to city, though he's not as versatile as the other names mentioned. An incredible young talent none the less. Who would you like to see in this role? It doesn't have to be someone on this list. How would you like to see them implemented?

In the CDM/CM department, we've all heard that Fernandinho could be on the way. He'd likely fill in for Toure in the ACoN, although he's not much younger, so I don't know if it's a great move in the long term when we've got Rodwell pining for game time, who we all saw demolish chelsea in that role. Rodwell might be able to fill in for Barry some, who's age has gotten the better of him at times this season, though I honestly think he has more potential in yaya's role, and een if he does fill in frequently for Barry, there's some risk that there's too much of a gap in Barry's bias towards experience, and Rodwell's towards youth that might need plugging in that CDM spot. Either way it might be good to get another CDM. De Rossi's name was thrown around a lot last year, but he's probably too old now, and probably won't leave Roma anyway. Who would you like to see? Do you have a better alternative to Fernandinho? DO you think we should be taking a different approach altogether?

That leaves defense. It's hard to argue against the effectiveness of the Kompany/nastypairing, but Kompany's injury this year coincided with a notable low point in out season. With Lescott and Kolo both potentially leaving, and neither one properly able to fill the gap, what do you think should be done here?

Let's get some discussion going here goes, I need to get my City fix somehow now that the rest of the season might as well be friendlies.

I know that as a US citizen I'm allowed to visit for 6 months without a visa, but I'm a bit lost on what I may need to do after that.  My job is with a US technology company that allows me to work from home, so I was planning on continuing to work from my laptop wherever I ended up living in London.  Given that I would be receiving income from a job but not actually working for a UK company in London, would I need a work visa to stay past 6 months?  I'm not sure how I would have it sponsored if so, as my work would really be external to the UK.  If I wouldn't need a work visa, how would I be able to stay for a full year?  I'm guessing if I were to stay for 3 months, return to the States for a week, stay another 3 months, return, etc., that immigration wouldn't be too keen with that.

Anyway, I'm looking for industry experience before starting and felt creating a hedge fund would be a great challenge to set myself. Obviously I will not be able to pump millions in to it but it should be an interesting process. Have any of you looked into it yourself? 

I've searched it on google but all the articles seem to be either sarcastic how-to's that take the piss out of the finance industry, or heavily worded articles that I cannot understand easily.

TL;DR Please show me how to create a legally registered hedge fund company.

There frequently seems to be something that happens in the past and affects the future but because it happened (and then there is some time traveling involved) then that thing happens in the past (because it affected the future already). In Doctor Who, I think of Ten trying to save River from sacrificing herself in the Forest of the Dead and Ten telling her that time can be rewritten but she says don't you dare (probably recalling the paradox caused by her not killing the Doctor at Lake Silencio). But then at Lake Silencio, River wants to rewrite time and stop herself from killing the Doctor but he says don't you dare (probably remembering what she said in the library when he attempts to save her).
Another example to illustrate the time paradox is the movie Somewhere in Time with Christopher Reeve and Jane Seymour. Old Jane gives Christopher a pocket watch in the future and tells him to come back to her. He figures out the time traveling (which is ridiculous but a story for another time), goes back in time to see young Jane and gives her the pocket watch. My question, where does the pocket watch come from?

The Doctor does not remember this, nor does anybody else in the universe, but it will be revealed to him in the upcoming finale. Note that all press materials for the finale say that the Doctor's biggest secret will be revealed, but none of them specify that the secret is his name. Because his name isn't what's going to be revealed, it's the fact that there's an incarnation of him that nobody remembers for some reason.

Anyway, here are a few more things we know: Steven Moffat has said Clara's secret will be revealed; Matt Smith has said the finale involves a very important event from both the Doctor's and Clara's lives; and Jenna-Louise Coleman has said that Clara and the Doctor have met before, aside from the meetings we've seen. With all this in mind I've come up with a relatively simple theory:

Clara was the John Hurt Doctor's companion. Something happened to both of them that caused them to lose their memories of their adventures, caused Hurt's Doctor to regenerate into Eccleston (explaining what his role would have been if he hadn't declined to return), and caused Clara to be scattered throughout history. This is also why Clara keeps subconsciously telling the Doctor to ""run you clever boy, and remember.""

Now I'm not saying I particularly like this theory, but it does seem possible based on the evidence we have about the finale.",false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,null,null,self,"Relatively simple Clara theory (incorporates spoilers/rumors about finale and 50th anniversary special, read at own risk!)",6,http://www.reddit.com/r/doctorwho/comments/1dj31l/relatively_simple_clara_theory_incorporates/

Now, there are *hundreds* of theories about who Clara is. Whether she's the TARDIS, an evil plot, or otherwise, I just wanted to point out two things that vaguely connect. the Doctor says in the latest episode ""The Journey to the Centre of the TARDIS"", that the TARDIS is infinite. No companion has ever known that without the doctor telling them, and even then, the Doctor hasn't referred to the TARDIS as 'endless' much. So, obviously, all of the companions would be shocked about how the control room of the TARDIS is larger than the police box which it is contained in, and therefore say: ""It's bigger on the inside"". But not Clara. For some reason or another, she looks into the TARDIS, then looks outside, into the air around her. She says then that it's ""smaller on the outside"". Weird, right? The obvious thing to say is that the inside is larger than it 'should be'. But maybe Clara has some sense (from being the TARDIS herself, or otherwise) that the TARDIS is so enormous - so vast, that she knows it is indeed *infinite*. That is the only reasoning that she could have to saying that the outside is smaller than the machine. Clara has some subconcious knowledge of the TARDIS. Make of this what you will, it's really just something I thought about when rewatching the christmas special and the latest episode.

Theory: Clara/Oswin was placed in multiple time zones by Rose when she was possessed by the time vortex, and may be her way of reaching out to him.

Possible Evidence:
- Rose placed the words 'Bad Wolf' all over time and space when she went all god-mode in Parting of the Ways, what would have stopped her from placing a person? Basically this is her and possibly Doctor Donna reaching out to them. She would be the Little Red Riding Hood leading him to the big Bad Wolf. 
-Rose has left the parallel world before.
-10 has his TARDIS, maybe they figured out how to get back to their reality and are searching for 11? 
-Rose is returning in the 50th Anniversary Special.
- BBC Doctor Who Official just tweeted a picture of the TARDIS with the 'Bad Wolf' tag on it a little while ago
-Clara 2013 got the Doctor's phone number from 'the girl in the shop', Rose was often working in shops and complained/joked about it a lot.
- Clara 2013's dad was nearly hit by the exact same car as Rose's dad. Edit: (Whoops! Nope, they're just the same colour and pretty similar looking)
- Clara 1800's worked at the Rose &amp;amp; Crown. 
-Clara 2013's mom died in March 2005, which is coincidentally the same month as Doctor Who's revival. (Let me fact check this one again, I have it written down but I can't recall if the March date is true) 


In my mind Clara's appearance is either a byproduct of Rose or the Great Intelligence. It's probably the Great Intelligence but I'm crossing my fingers for Rose.

Get more from your Virgin Broadband service


We've noticed that you enjoy being online, especially in the evening. So here are some useful tips, to help you get the most out of your service:


1. Download big files after 11pm

We don't limit how much you use the internet, but at our busiest time (between 4pm and 11pm Monday to Friday and 11am to 11pm weekends) your speed may be reduced for a short time by our traffic management system. For more info, visit virginmedia.com/traffic.

In my defence this is a new number. I'm not British and the numbers here have a different syntax;  I should've triple checked.  

This incident doesn't put me in the best light, but I'm still quite interested in the job. The job ad is still posted online, so there's still hope.

Basically I'm looking for a medium-powered 600 due to price constraints and the necessity of easy motorway miles (something smaller CC bikes may struggle with) and have landed on three potentials so far - Suzuki SV 650, Honda Hornet 600 or a Yamaha FZ6. 

Basically my problem is that trying to find a bike which complies with the new licence is an absolute nightmare - I can't seem to find genuine power-outputs for either the Honda or the FZ6, they all seem to range from 98 (too high for me to restrict) to 90 (which would be legal) for the Yamaha whereas the Honda can be anywhere from 85 - 95. 

I know that the new license laws dictate that I cannot restrict a bike if it is more than 94HP or 0.2KW/KG (which both bikes comply to when restricted) but I was under the impression that this figure should come from the wheel not the crank. If the bike is claimed 98HP at the crank, then surely it complies with the licensing laws at the wheel?

Basically, can someone please clear up where I'm supposed to get this power figure from so I can finally make a decision and get my bike! Failing that, does anyone actually have a 1998-2000 Hornet or a 2005 Yamaha FZ6 and know the power output on them for certain?

How hard is it to form another subreddit specifically for content containing spoilers?

I love a lot of content in this subreddit, even though it tends to cycle through too many overposted trends (omg look at this TARDIS cosplay dress u guyzz), but the fact is,

TOO MUCH IS SPOILED.

Even not clicking through and purple-izing the links, the simple headlines often give too much information. (Example: a recent post titled ""First ""Name of the Doctor"" pic has strong parallels with Asylum!"")

I generally avoid spoilers for everything, but to me, Doctor Who is special. A special show, and especially worth avoiding spoilers. Doctor Who always *surprises* me. Doctor Who *blows my mind*. Doctor Who is *worth* rewatching to catch all the clues you missed.

Doctor Who is the show I least want to ever know even the slightest detail about any episode I haven't already seen. (I still love all that backstage info, but c'mon, it will still be there after the episode airs...)

So, I guess I will have to sacrifice the TARDIS dresses, cakes, and watercolors (I will admit the TARDIS ukele was pretty cute...and original?), the rarely seen photos and adorbz color ink sketches of the recent Doctors with their companions (for the record, before I go, Donna is still my favorite), and all the other fun-y-wun-y time-y-wime-y bits...

Putting aside the fact that this seems like pure speculation, I'm not sure how I'd feel about this. Alonso's a great player who would be excellent depth - and a good stop-gap if our long-term plan is to groom Chalobah for this role - but given the return of Romeu and Essien next season I think we should be spending our money on a young DM that can start the bulk of our matches (Gundogan, Fellaini, etc) for the next 3-5 years. 

Imagine even if his transfer fee is modest he'll have pretty high wage expectations having been at Real (and benefiting from lower tax levels in Spain). It's a no for me...

**Match Facts**

* Chelsea are hoping to qualify for our 12th final over the 10 years of the Roman Abramovich era, and our fifth European final overall.
* On Sunday Frank Lampard equalled Andy Cole's record of scoring against 38 different Premier League clubs 
* This is the 35th successive midweek our players have played for club or country.
* Nine players from Chelsea and Basel's squads will be suspended for the final if they are booked tonight (four from Chelsea and five from Basel).
* If the score after 90 minutes is 2-1 to Basel then extra time will be played and if necessary penalties. The away goals rule applies so any other score will result in the game ending after normal time.
* Chelsea have won three of our last five penalty shoot-outs, the last being at the Allianz Arena in the Champions League final against Bayern Munich.

I’m a 21 year old male without any direction at the moment. I was recently kicked out of Manchester University where I was studying for a BSc in chemistry. It’s a long story really, but now I’m just sat about at home feeling sorry for myself.

The idea of the US college system appeals to me. Learning about a broad spectrum of things before specializing in a major seems like a more balanced way to go about higher education than what we have in the UK. I’ve been thinking about packing my bags, putting the UK universities behind me and studying as a college student in the US. I’ve liked the look of Boston University, Northwestern University, UC Berkeley and the University of British Columbia and the University of Toronto (obviously, the last two being in Canada).

I’ve really not looked at these in too much detail just yet, as I’m not even sure I’d be eligible for acceptance at all. I basically have a few questions about applying and college life in general across the Atlantic.

Are there a lot of students in their 20s starting out in the US college system? In the UK, courses consist of a majority of ages, especially at the bigger universities in the cities. I was one of the youngest on my course despite starting a couple of years “late”.

Would I actually be able to get in? I hold A Levels in chemistry, physics and biology. I’d be looking at doing something in the physical sciences such as chemistry or possibly some kind of engineering. My grades aren't straight As though. I have mostly Bs.

How does one actually apply? I'm sure most of you will know this but I'll explain just in case anyway - In the UK, we have a central website (called UCAS) that a student must go through in order to apply for any university. It basically manages every students A Level grades, GCSE grades (high school grades), personal statement etc. to then send electronically to your chosen (maximum of 5) universities. I think that you have to apply directly to the university in the States and to as many as you want, right?

Is it plausible for me to afford this? Obviously, I’m not rich but I understand that thousands of students journey to the US and UK for their university education. How are they expected to pay and is there any help or loans available for international students? I’m worried about this part the most.

Sorry if this is all over the place Reddit. I’d really love to hear your advice if you’re a UK student in the US or a US student that understands how internationals go about applying.

Many thanks.",false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,null,null,self,Questions for UK students in the USA or any USA students that know a thing or two about international students,13,http://www.reddit.com/r/AskUK/comments/1dkpik/questions_for_uk_students_in_the_usa_or_any_usa/

I just got done watching End of Time again, and the thought struck me that there was no good reason why his regeneration got so destructive in the final moments.  We saw Nine regenerate in the TARDIS quite calmly, with Rose present, so why was Ten's so explosive?

What I keep coming back to is that maybe Ten was so distraught (""I don't want to go"") and feeling deeply alone, that in the last moments his expression tightens and he unleashes regeneration energy against the TARDIS.  This destroys the control room and sends the ship crashing to earth.

Do you think Ten did this intentionally, not wanting his next self to survive?  Was the trip to see all his past companions before the regeneration meant to be a true goodbye?

Edit: A lot of people have mentioned that they think the intensity was due to either him fighting the regeneration or putting it off.  That may be true, we don't really know that the ""rules"" of regeneration are, but we've seen the modern Doctor regenerate 2 (and a half) times, River Song twice, and the Master once (also in the TARDIS).   Ten to me specifically turned and ""fired"" energy at the TARDIS console and doors.   So while delaying may or may not have intensified it, I still can't shake that Ten used the energy to set up a potentially fatal crash.",false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,null,null,self,Was Ten suicidal in the final moments of his regeneration?,46,http://www.reddit.com/r/doctorwho/comments/1dkvkc/was_ten_suicidal_in_the_final_moments_of_his/

During their broadcast they will be doing a live Skype call to us and I guess any other venues doing the same thing and we can all shout ""HUZZAH FOR KING GEORGE!"" at them and pretend we're having a great time.

The venue is the Assembly House, Kentish Town at around 5pm(tbc) May 19th. (http://www.assemblyhouse.co.uk/)

They regularly host SC2 events for Barcraft, and the staff are very keen on this becoming a regular Dota2 venue in London in a similar fashion.

In short:

Capacity is around 60 people but I will confirm this. Honestly if we get 60 I'll be delighted, and if we get more then that's both a good and bad thing. Good because it means a full house, but bad because I really would hate to turn anyone away. I have a few people that will be travelling from around the country, and I am going to reserve spaces for them so if we start to get full early, please understand that there are a few people I'm holding spots for. So get down early!

One of those people is Cyborgmatt. Sooooo...yeah. HE'S KIND OF A BIG DEAL. He's going to be there saying ""I can't tell you that"" to every single question you ask him. Trust me.

So what does this mean to you, weary reader?

1. If you are over 18 and want to watch Dota 2 on a big screen with a drunken idiot (me) come along.

2. Bring money. Please buy drinks. They are doing us a massive favour by giving us this space for the afternoon. If we all sit there nursing a shandy then this will be the last such event at that pub.

3. If the games run over and we end up looking at a 5th match and it's 11:30pm on a Sunday night, we will probably have to leave. Most people will probably have to leave to get trains etc by then anyway. If this is not the sort of service you expect from a free event, then please do stay home. Also, kiss my arse.

I can't think of any more things at the moment. But I will be updating this thread with any new info I find and of course answering all your terrible questions.

I really want the UK Dota scene to flourish, and I think getting a regular thing going like this in London would be a good start. If this goes well, I fully intend to make a regular Dota 2 Pubstomp, and hopefully we've found our venue.

Questions and Answers here! I will answer them tomorrow because it's bloody late and I am knackered.

**Note just to add: The games will start at 4pm, so definitely get there early.**",false,UKDota,t5_2uyoj,null,null,self,"PFlax Presents the Perfect Pubstomp : Sunday May 19th, London (X-Post from /r/Dota2)",18,http://www.reddit.com/r/UKDota/comments/1dl4x0/pflax_presents_the_perfect_pubstomp_sunday_may/

Suarez had to be a winger, trequartista and a striker a the start of this season. Coutinho became the link we missed between the midfield and the strikers so Suarez could focus more on his own job. Hendo finally grew some balls and started playing more like a senior than a junior player. I love seeing him in the more attacking role with some confidence, it's like a new player. Sturridge has the potential to be a great striker. Downing is for me a squadplayer who is more useful when we need to defend. Luis is Luis. 

So next season. It's not like the top 5 teams wont strengthen their squads. And I think we need some quality players. We dont have City money, we cant pick from the top shelf and we dont have a top 5 squad. What defender can we sign to make us solid at the back and maybe stop us from conceding so many easy goals from corners etc? A rock at the back, a player who maybe scores some goals from corners aswell. Who can bring some more quality upfront? A striker that's actually inside the box when the cross comes in, winning headers and decide the games we are struggling in? A player like Mata that both scores, creates chances and is allways on the ball? You want a new keeper or some other changes in other positions?

A while back in 2010, I was really invested in creating LEGO Transformers, and pretty much anything in LEGO. One day on Youtube, i found a video of something called LEGO Doctor Who. I clicked on it and the guy doing the video said it was the Eleventh Doctor, and I was like ""Whaaaaat??"". I was really confused, so I did some research and found out it was a  British science fiction T.V. show, and aired on BBC America (yes, I'm American). Soon, later one night, late at night, I was bored and tired and started flipping through channels and saw Doctor Who was on, so I decided to watch it. What I saw was a man and woman walking out a blue box in 1930's New York, and kept on watching for a little bit more (the episode was Daleks in Manhattan). I got tired, and never finished watching. I guess I was too tired to pay attention or anything. 

A long period of time passed, and I saw Doctor Who pop up again while channel surfing, and decided ""What the heck?"". This episode was called ""Midnight"". What followed was one of the most intense television programs I have ever watched, just the dialogue was so good! I was so invested in the story, and the Doctor's actions had me at the edge of my couch. This experience alone still makes ""Midnight"" my favorite Who episode ever.

That night I did a lot more research, and spent almost the whole night reading about 'Doctor Who'. I got a little dissapointed, because I just missed Series 5 by a few weeks, so I just watched a bunch of re-runs of 10 on BBCA, and eventually found all of the NuWho on Netflix and was overcome with joy. I watched almost every single episode, from 'Rose' to 'The Big Bang', with some of the Tennant specials missing on Netflix. I did this all within a  month. 

While I started watching 10 re-runs, he is not my favorite Doctor, who just so happens to be 11. I feel that Matt Smith's acting chops is just so powerful, and he goes above and beyond the standard to put in so much emotion. 10 got me close to crying, but 11 just brings me to tears inside. Also, 9 was fantastic, just wish he had a longer tenure, like everyone else wants. 11 is my Doctor, and I will travel with him 'till the end.

Thanks for reading, I just wanted to share my story as i hold it close to my heart.",false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,null,null,default,How I Got Into Doctor Who.,8,http://www.reddit.com/r/doctorwho/comments/1dlmyy/how_i_got_into_doctor_who/

But what if by answering the question ""Doctor who?"" it would mean the end of the show? It is certainly the first question of the Doctor Who universe and if the show ever stopped then it certainly would be the end of that universe. And after 50 years it is damn near impossible to answer that question to the satisfaction of most of the fans so it should never be answered except by either an amazingly brilliant writer, or one looking to end the show for good (or evil).

* The new manager; so by all accounts we're getting **Mourinho** back, [the sun](http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/sport/football/4912934/Jose-Mourinho-agrees-Chelsea-return-on-July-1.html) reporting this morning that the deal is done and will be announced on July 1. Is this a done deal and who are the other options?

* So the next strongest candidate is [**Manuel Pellegrini**](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/chelsea/10002227/Chelsea-open-talks-with-Manuel-Pellegrini-over-summer-switch-to-Stamford-Bridge.html) Whom the club were reported to have been talking to just a few weeks ago. Since then of course the talk of Mourinhos return has become so strong that anything else has become  implausible.

* The other managerial candidates linked with the club have been; **David Moyes**, [**Jurgen Klopp**](http://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/manchester-united-want-jurgen-klopp-1866268) who the mirror now say is being lined up for the United job and **Fabio Capello** amongst others. but with the [bookies now only taking odds of 2/9](http://www.thesackrace.com/teams/chelsea) on **Mourinho** it's barely worth a flutter on anyone else.

* **So if the special one does return, who will he bring with him?**

* First up a deal that only a week ago was almost wrapped up [**Andre Schurrle**](http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/transfers/chelsea-to-secure-20m-andre-schurrle-deal-within-days-8589003.html) His agent claiming it was a done deal, so why has it all gone quiet? And do we need another versataile forward who's not really an out and out striker?

* Talking of out and out strikers, so far we've been linked with a couple; first our old friend [**Falcao**](http://www.goal.com/en/news/11/transfer-zone/2013/05/01/3944929/deals-agreed-mourinho-falcao-are-chelsea-bound) The ever dependable (Whats the emoji for sarcasm?) Goal.com reporting that a deal for falcoa was being wrapped up, although they had no sources, or quotes for this, we'll just take it as fact...
regardless

* Secondly there was a strange rumour regarding [**Robert Lewandowski**](http://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/jose-mourinho-asks-robert-lewandowski-1866002) who according to the mirror and the German paper Bild (who have been fairly accurate recently) was texted by Mourinho just 24 hours after Bayern smashed barca (damn that feels good) to invite him to chelsea. i would fucking love Lewandowski but like Chelsea Blog [WAGNH](http://www.weaintgotnohistory.com/chelsea-fc-transfer-rumours-news/2013/5/3/4296164/on-the-robert-lewandowski-rumour?) He is more likely to head to Bayern or Man Utd, but starnger things have happened, I'm looking at you monsieur Hazard!

* Ok so who else? we need a central midfielder, right? So here's a couple more we've been linked with; first up long term rumoured target [**Marouane Fellaini**](http://www.caughtoffside.com/2013/03/24/chelsea-make-25m-everton-midfielder-marouane-fellaini-five-year-contract-offer-worth-22-5m/) plenty of the usual papers and blogs ran a story last month that Chelsea had placed a bid for the dynamic midfielder/striker/centre back/belgium of around £22 - £25mil pounds.

* The last couple of days have seen several reports linking us to [**Xabi Alonso**](http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/premier-league/xabi-alonso-could-follow-jose-mourinho-to-chelsea-in-cheap-deal-8599978.html) The independent take the lead on this story saying that the rifts in the Real team and a longing to return to the premiership means Xabi will make his way to West London with Mourinho for ""Cheap""

* but hey we don't need those guys with [**Super frank**](http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/premier-league/chelsea-offer-frank-lampard-new-deal-after-contract-rethink-8598278.html) staying, do we? After a U-Turn not seen since the last Tory policy rethink. Franks getting a shot at another year in charge. 

* Talking of returning midfielders, don't forget [**The Bison**](http://www.standard.co.uk/sport/football/michael-essien-insists-hell-get-back-in-chelsea-team-8598793.html|) is coming home also and is looking for a place back in the 1st team.

* We're also after partizan attaker [**Lazar Markovic**](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-2317462/Chelsea-leading-race-sign-Lazar-Markovic.html#ixzz2S11S3JBB%20) the 19yo is one very much for the future, expect to see him go out on loan.

Ok well that's enough for today! For those of you who are new to the sub, we ask that all rumour posts and links are kept to this thread, I'll be posting one every other day(usually) all through the summer and they will be stickied on the sidebar. Please up vote the thread for visibility, it's a self post so I don't get any Karma(not that I care)!

I have been watching some 9 and 10 episodes, and one major difference I've noticed is the way Matt Smith interacts with the Sonic.

I am highly entertained and intrigued by the way he points it at nearly everything, waving it around, and sticking his face out at whatever he's using it on.  Whereas, Tennant seems to pull it out, point it, look at it, and put it away in a very matter of fact manner.

My question is, do any of the ""classic"" Doctors have any unique behavior traits when using the Sonic?  ",false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,null,null,self,Crazy with the Sonic Screwdriver,9,http://www.reddit.com/r/doctorwho/comments/1dm1yo/crazy_with_the_sonic_screwdriver/

Little Free Libraries are small community boxes that advocate and promote literacy through the simple ""take a book, leave a book"" sharing concept. I've always loved this idea and what better way to symbolize the vast universes of adventure and time travel that books can provide than housing them in a TARDIS!!

I've seen others use this idea before, but I am starting from scratch and building my own design (as well as adding the Geocaching concept!). I hope to inspire other fellow Whovians and book lovers to start their own library project in their neighborhood as well.


If you'd like to learn more and possibly help out [please visit the Kickstarter project here](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/127226064/little-blue-box-free-library-its-bigger-on-the-ins)

If you want to follow along in the building process [I'll be sharing step-by-step photos on Facebook here and posting the building plans once finished](https://www.facebook.com/LittleBlueBoxFreeLibrary)

I'd be ever so grateful for any help and support in getting the word out for this wonderful idea. At the very least, I'll come back to share the finished Little Blue Box when it's complete.

I did a little research and I found that Oswald can also mean ""God"". Obviously, the name Clara Oswin Oswald was selected for a reason.

Originally, I thought it was simply referring to a 'clever' 'friend of God'. In this case, one can assume that God refers to The Doctor (**Rings** anyone?). However, this leaves the last name, Oswald, unexplained. One possibility I see is that Clara's name does not refer to what she *is*, but instead what she *will be*. She has obviously been clever, in the Asylum, in the Snowmen and currently. She has called herself Oswin, but not Oswald. Interpret this as you will.

At current time, Clara refers to herself as Clara. In fact, if I remember correctly, she did not know the name 'Oswin' meaning 'friend of God' is not part of her name. Instead her name is simply Clever God. Interpret this how you will, I am not quite sure if the exemption of Oswin is bad or good. 

In Journey to the Center of the TARDIS, The Doctor confronts her, asking who she is. She responds that she doesn't know and tells the Doctor that he's scaring her. If she is really not a friend of The Doctor's it is possible she is scared of breaking her cover.

This adds on to the hint pertaining to the 50th Anniversary Episode that was revealed from a picture taken on set. [http://i.imgur.com/BCzE1u6.jpg] It shows a sign for the Coal Hill Secondary School with the name I. Chesterton (Ian Chesterton) as Chairman of Governors. This not only tells us on his most likely appearance in the episode, but that he will most likely be portrayed by another actor. We already know that Doctor Who, The Sarah Jane Adventures, and Torchwood are directly connected to one another, so I don't think that they will just throw that quip about their age away to be forgotten.

It struck me that little Clara (https://gs1.wac.edgecastcdn.net/8019B6/data.tumblr.com/f4459c0a867ff9c40b3aa830334f26be/tumblr_mld9wuvkQT1rhxe2eo1_500.jpg) looks a lot like a younger version of CAL (https://gs1.wac.edgecastcdn.net/8019B6/data.tumblr.com/4362cd159565ba933a0edb4702b24bb7/tumblr_inline_ml6i622T0P1qz4rgp.jpg)

At the end of Forest of the Dead, we see CAL being put to bed along with 2 other children by River Song. It was previously established that these children were NOT real. Therefore, they are part of CAL as CAL is the computer. This means that they have no physical bodies of their own and their personalities are dictated by CAL, they're a part of it.  

As we know, there are 3 Clara's. And 3 children. All 3 were physically manifested somehow throughout time and space. But because there was only 1 physical template the same one was used each time. Perhaps unbeknownst to whoever did this, the person was actually also the same each time due to their nature. However, they aren't really connected to each other in the way that memories and knowledge would transfer over. They're 3 seperate entities who are for all intents and purposes the same. 

What makes this even more interesting is that River Song is in there as well. She knows that the Doctor would one day meet Clara. Maybe she has a hand to play in this? 

Furthermore, at the end of the episode, CAL says ""I was worried you might be lonely, so I brought you some friends. Aren't I a clever girl?"". As we know, Clara's catchphrase is Run You Clever Boy And Remember. Remember what, though? All he can remember are things that have happened in the past, can't he? Therefore the clue to Clara must lie in his past somewhere. 

On top of this, CAL is great with computers (no wonder, she *is* a computer!) and so is Clara. 

This also explains why everyone sees Clara as an ordinary girl, including Clara, except for... the TARDIS. The TARDIS sees all of time at once. She already knows who Clara really is. That's why she doesn't like her. 

Oh and, in CAL, Doctor Moon was all about memory. Forgetting and remembering. Not sure how this would fit into this all... Maybe the Doctor is trapped in a computer somehow? And he has to remember?

Thoughts? Anything that would smash this theory? ",false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,null,null,self,Clara theory: Clara is CAL,1,http://www.reddit.com/r/doctorwho/comments/1do88w/clara_theory_clara_is_cal/

I want to see if we can glean advice and knowledge from each other. But also, I just like to talk about food.

Tomorrow is my first BBQ of the season. I've had BBQs at my mums but this is my 1st one. I'm pretty happy about it. Anyway, down to the nitty gritty.

I've got these ribs in the freezer from the butchers. Been there for about a month now. I figured I'm finally going to crack them out for a BBQ. I know a BBQ is not the best way to do ribs, but I don't care. I'm doing it. I just wondered if anyone has got any tips. I'm using the technique in [this video.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3AQCLj30KY) Basically, place ribs above tray of water and leave burning coals around the sides of tray. Put dry rub on ribs, cook for an hour-ish. Wrap ribs in foil for last half hour. Apply sauce for final ten minutes.

Does anyone have any recommendations for the dry-rub? I'm thinking pimenton, pepper, salt, chilli. And also for the glaze? I'm thinking honey, garlic, but not sure whether to add soy or lime? Maybe soy is not appropriate for a BBQ. Talk to me!

Also, what's some good veggie stuff for a bbq? Mrs HBK is a part time veggie so need to consider that. Obviously halloumi, corn and peppers. Any other suggestions?

Feel free to link to some recipes.

BBQ musts IMO;

* Cheap plastic cheese.
* Suasages/Burgers
* Halloumi
* Corn on the Cob

Lester has beaten Forrest in the last minute meaning a win must happen.Unfortunately that didn't happen. 

When the referee blew his whistle, the only people celebrating was Blackpool.The Bolton fans remained silent,not even applause was heard from them. The shock of not making the playoffs is devastating. And after an in incredible atmosphere, it was shocking that Bolton won't return to the Premier League, it feels just as bad as we was being relegated last season.

I feel depressed.It was on goal difference.My voice is going after shouting and cheering Bolton on.

There is always next season.What we need to do now is support the boys.They may not be in the play offs.But to me they are winners for getting this far, and I will support Bolton for as long as it takes.

Never done one of these before, so lemme know if you have any suggestions!

In the US, [espn.com has a live steam](http://espnfc.com/us/en/gamecast/345874/gamecast.html?soccernet=true&amp;cc=5901)

**4'** Defoe has a shot that hits the side net.

**11'** Really nice ball gives Southampton a chance, but Clyne hit it wide. Could've been 1-0.

**14'** Southampton dominating possession so far, but Spurs looking to be getting their rhythm.

**22'** First corner of the game for Spurs, but easily defended away.

**29'** Southampton works their way into the box, but it's cleared away. Southampton look clearly the better team so far.

**34'** Dembele's down.

**35'** Substitution: Holtby on for Dembele.

**36'** Hugo saves us twice! Parries the free kick to the bar and then catches the header. What a save.

**41'** Defoe's fed in the box, but called for a shove. Questionable call there.

**42'** Lloris was waiting to get an errant ball at the edge of the box, but Vertonghen kicks it away. No communication. Spurs are looking shaky right now.

**45+2'** Looking much more dangerous in these two added minutes.

**Halftime** Stats according to ESPN.

Possession: Southampton 51-49 Tottenham

Shots (on goal): 4(2)-2(0)

Fouls: 6-6

Tackles: 12-9.

**46'** Second half begins. COYS!

**52'** Lallana for Southampton with a clever little move, but gets no power on the shot. Pretty simple save for Lloris.

**55'** Bale has been near invisible this game. Seems as though he needs to be more effective.

**59'** Pressure from Southampton. Three straight corners end in a goal kick.

**60'** Substitution: Adebayor on for Lennon.

**65'** Substitution: Mayuka on for Do Prado.

**68'** Beautiful set up with the flick from Ade, but Dempsey puts it over the bar. A sign of life for Spurs.

**71'** Yellow Card: Benny gets the first of the game.

**72'** Substitution: Siggy on for Dempsey. Last sub for Spurs.

**73'** Yellow Card: Davis for Southampton takes Defoe down from behind. Clear yellow.

**75'** Tottenham still do not have a shot on target. Wow. 

**79'** Handball claims for Spurs off a corner, but no call given. Would've been a pretty weak penalty.

**80'** Substitution: Puncheon on for Lallana.

**81'** Bale goes down in the box, again no penalty.

**83'** Bale shot gets a shot deflected. Southampton seem to be playing for the draw. Replays show Bale should have gotten the penalty call.

**86'** GOOOOOOOOOOOOOAL MOTHERFUCKING BALE. Takes it himself and buries it in the lower left hand corner. Absolutely beautiful. He scores when he wants.

**90'** Four minutes added. 

**90+2'** Adebayor with the hustle to put pressure on the keeper. Love it.

**90+4'** There's the final whistle! 1-0 Spurs win!

And a collective sigh of relief is breathed. And let's fucking go 'Arry.",false,coys,t5_2ryq7,null,null,self,Match Thread,25,http://www.reddit.com/r/coys/comments/1dognv/match_thread/

Now I am wondering if any of you would be interested in making a logo with the name in it, or some potential album art. If It ended up getting used for the final album I could pay you. And obviously you would get credit on the album.

Way back in the classic series Logopolis, The Tardis materialized around the Master's Tardis, making an endless recursion of tardises (tardisi?).  Something like that would give even a 27 dimensional entity a headache, and you probably wouldn't like the other entity that caused the recursion.

Then, we discover that the Master was resurrected for the Last Great Time War, but fled in his Tardis and hid beneath a Chameleon Arch as professor Yana.  (No, I'm not suggesting that Clara is the Master).  But what happened to his Tardis.  The Master isn't one to underestimate enemies that he's afraid of...he's always cautious when it comes to preserving himself.  And even a powered down Tardis is findable and could lead the Daleks and their allies to him.

So we're left with the question, What Would the Master do?

What if this evil genius (who is capable of things even the Doctor can't do) decided to kill his Tardis.  Doing so without blowing a hole in the Universe (which would be a big Neon Sign saying ""Daleks, a timelord is HERE!"") is problematic.  (I will note that the Doctor told Rose to just leave his Tardis in ""Parting of the Ways"" and it would slowly die unnoticed by people, but it would be a long process that the Master would be unwilling to use).

What if the Master forced the consciousness of his Tardis through a Chameleon Arch type device, but, the nature of this 27 dimension entity means instead of one human hiding a timelord, what if there are many of the same individual created through time.  What if each Clara is a part of the Master's missing Tardis?

This would explain her brilliance, her appearance and re-appearance in different time coordinates, and it would explain why the Doctor's Tardis doesn't seem to like her.  It would also explain, I think, that quirk that she is the first to exclaim, ""It's smaller on the outside"".  Perhaps, if all the Clara's are found and brought together, there will be a new Tardis.

Ya, I know it's unlikely, but I think this would be a neat explanation for Clara.",false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,null,null,self,What I want Clara to be.,4,http://www.reddit.com/r/doctorwho/comments/1doj35/what_i_want_clara_to_be/

With Luiz hopefully moving to CDM we'd have Cahill, Iva and Terry as CBs. Solid defense and probably enough defenders to rotate aswell but I think Kalas could challenge them for a spot because it will be probably Terrys last season at a high level due to his age and with Iva being our BU RB there should be enough matches for a 4th, very talented CB.

For me, there is a standout player who I believe is just a let down every single week. Jonny Howson. Admittedly he had an okay first half today, but in the second half he converted back to his old self. In the role we play him in, his job is to create from deep, keep moves flowing and prove to be an overall annoyance when on the defensive, marking people and closing down. Consistently over the past weeks I have seen so very little of the above. His tracking back when we need him to is absolutely dire, he was merely jogging back when Reading scored the other week after watching McCleary waltz through into all that space. We then conceded a very similar goal to Agbonlahor today, with Howson being the closest to him from the midfield (i.e. excluding the defence). Going forward should be where he excels though, theoretically, but I honestly believe he simply harms our attack. He constantly slows down attacking moves by pointlessly passing sideways, taking too long to decide what to do with the ball or simply putting in bad passes. He neither rushes to join the attack and help out, nor rushes back if they break on us following a failed move. We've had serious trouble with our link up play this season, and I think he has been one of the main causes of it. I simply do not understand why Tettey or even Fox havn't been started above him.

Feel free to argue Howson's case, he's clearly been starting games for a reason under Hughton, so if anyone can come up with some I'd love to hear them. 

Other than that, what players do you believe are truly letting us down this season? Obviously this is probably gonna lead to comments about Hughton's management of these players, and thats understandable and fine, but I'd rather focus on individual players than team problems like ""we just can't build an attack from midfield, our play through the midfield is bad"" etc.",false,NorwichCity,t5_2sv0y,null,null,self,"In terms of players, where do you guys believe we are going (have gone) wrong?",5,http://www.reddit.com/r/NorwichCity/comments/1dotae/in_terms_of_players_where_do_you_guys_believe_we/

A ninth successive home win would have capped a remarkable turnaround for a Wanderers team placed 20th at the start of February, and one point looked like being enough at the Reebok on Saturday until Anthony Knockaert gave Leicester a last-gasp 3-2 win over Nottingham Forest to secure sixth place for the Foxes.

Blackpool attacked with a verve rarely seen since their stint as early season pace-setters and fine goals from Matt Phillips and Ludo Sylvestre had them 2-0 up after 35 minutes.

That lead appeared safe as the interval approached, but Chris Eagles and recalled striker Craig Davies were on hand to haul Wanderers level.

Darren Pratley and Lee Chung-Yong passed up chances to give Bolton the win they ultimately needed - misses they were left to rue after Knockaert's late intervention.

Simon Cox's early goal for play-off rivals Forest meant Bolton had to find their feet.

But Blackpool made the breakthrough in stunning fashion after 21 breathless minutes - Phillips emerging from slick one-touch interplay involving Tom Ince and Gary Taylor-Fletcher to lash left-footed into the top corner.

The visitors went further in front before the break. Paul Ince's side once more benefited from static defending with aplomb - Neal Eardley's lofted cross to the edge of the area was crisply volleyed home as Sylvestre claimed a fourth goal in six matches.

In an attempt to turn things around, Dougie Freedman sent on striker Marvin Sordell in place of Robert Hall eight minutes before the break and his team unleashed a staggering turnaround in injury time.

Two of the outstanding performers in Bolton's late-season rally combined to reduce the arrears as Eagles arched an excellent side-footed finish into the top corner from 18 yards after Marcos Alonso raided down the left.

And in the last act of the half, Davies' hopeful strike from distance took a wicked deflection off Stephen Crainey to leave Gilks with no chance and send the Reebok into raptures.

The momentum kept up after the break. Davies and Eagles tried their luck from distance but an open game equally suited Blackpool, for whom Ince's influence was growing.

Gary MacKenzie was forced into an acrobatic clearance for Blackpool, Matt Gilks did well to push Alonso's 30-yard free-kick clear and Lee was guilty of a glaring miss in the 84th minute.

Hearts were in mouths at the other end when Adam Bogdan tipped over a rasping Sylvestre strike from the corner of the box but worse news arrived from the City Ground.

Wanderers surged forwards once more during five additional minutes but David Wheater could not turn home a cross from fellow sub Tom Eaves, leaving them agonisingly short.

_______

###Current Table

||||| | 
|-|-|-| - | - | - |
||Team|Played|GD|Points
||Arsenal|36|31|67
||Chelsea|34|33|65
||Tottenham|35|18|65


##Situation 1 ] Points are tied
So in case points are tied at the end of the season we have a better goal difference than both Tottenham and Arsenal. Arsenal can catch upto our GD but Tottenham cant so if we are tied on points come end of season we have a pretty good chance.

_________

##Situation 2 ] Maximum points

Tottenham have 3 games in hand, Chelsea have 4 and Arsenal only have 2. **If all teams win all points then the table will look like**

||||| | 
|-|-|-| - | - | - |
||Team|Played|GD|Points
||Chelsea|38|-|77
||Tottenham|38|-|74
||Arsenal|38|-|73

*Tottenham and Chelsea have to play each other so only one of them can get maximum points*.

We are again at that advantage as most points to play for.

__________

###Fixture by Fixture

**If Chelsea**

##Win against United - The table will look like

||||| | 
|-|-|-| - | - | - |
||Team|Played|GD|Points
||Chelsea|35|-|68
||Arsenal|36|-|67
||Tottenham|35|-|65

**So going into the Spurs game we can even lose and still stay in front of Spurs on goal difference but would then need to win the rest of the games.**

- **So if we win against United we would need only a maximum of 5 points from 3 games to qualify if our GD is still better than Arsenal**

- **6 points from 3 remaining games to qualify without any doubt.**

*This even if Tottenham and Arsenal win all their games*

**If Chelsea**

##Loses against United - The table will look like

||||| | 
|-|-|-| - | - | - |
||Team|Played|GD|Points
||Arsenal|36|-|67
||Chelsea|35|-|65
||Tottenham|35|-|65

**Still ahead of Tottenham but will need to win against Tottenham. If we draw against Tottenham in this situation then we will need to win the rest of the matches to qualify. If we lose to Tottenham after losing to United then Tottenham will go 2 points ahead.**

**If Chelsea**
##Draw against  United - The table will look like

||||| | 
|-|-|-| - | - | - |
||Team|Played|GD|Points
||Arsenal|36|-|67
||Chelsea|35|-|66
||Tottenham|35|-|65

**Not much will change but we will have that 1 point in hand. Going into the Tottenham game a win for us will still be the best outcome obviously. A draw though in this situation (given if we can win the rest of the matches) isn't bad either and we will always keep an upper hand even while drawing to Tottenham and drawing to United.**

__________

###Upcoming fixture difficulty

#
##Chelsea



||||| | 
|-|-|-| - | - | - |
||Home||Away|Opponents form Ranked 1 to 20 out of Premiership teams. Lower numbers for more difficulty|
||United|vs|Chelsea|6|
||Chelsea|vs|Tottenham|4|
||Villa|vs|Chelsea|7|
||Chelsea|vs|Everton|5|

**Chelsea faces by far the toughest opposition. All teams we are facing are currently in the top 7 in form teams in the Premiership. Chelsea is ranked second in form so statistically they should win all remaining games (but fuck these weird stats).**


##Tottenham

||||| | 
|-|-|-| - | - | - |
||Home||Away|Opponents form Ranked 1 to 20 out of Premiership teams. Lower numbers for more difficulty|
||Chelsea|vs|Tottenham|2|
||Stoke|vs|Tottenham|11|
||Tottenham|vs|Sunderland|13|

**Apart from Chelsea, Tottenham's remaining 2 fixtures are very easy on paper. They are 4th in the form ranking so statistically they would lose to Chelsea and win the rest**.



##Arsenal

||||| | 
|-|-|-| - | - | - |
||Home||Away|Opponents form Ranked 1 to 20 out of Premiership teams. Lower numbers for more difficulty|
||Arsenal|vs|Wigan|9|
||Newcastle|vs|Arsenal|15|

**Arsenal have the advantage here. They are ranked as the top in form team in the league right now with 14 points from the last 6 matches compared to 13 of Chelsea. Statistically they should win their remaining two fixtures as well (though we saw what happened to stats vs United).**

_________

My conclusion : The way I see it is that the next match against United tomorrow is the most important one. We win that and we will be in the driving seat. We cannot risk it all against a match vs Tottenham because we don't really know what can happen in the game. By slouching against United we might end up falling short both for the Europa League trophy and the top 4 finish for being in trouble from all sides. 

Not only are our remaining fixtures more difficult than the rest, we also have a Europa League final dropping right in the middle of them. If we win tomorrow it will also give us the motivation boost we need to get in a great run of form and winning the matches left.

We may have not got the result, but i've been to ever home game this season, and that has been the best atmosphere! Thank You again!

This for me has been an amazing season for the Wanderers. Crazy to think on the 2nd February we was in the relegation zone for a brief time. Now we're 7th with an unbeaten home run in 2013. I want to take my hat off to Dougie and the boys for a fantastic turn around. **Thank you**

This BY FAR has been my best season as a Bolton Wanderers fan and i'm going to keep my season ticket because this is the first time i've felt something. Prior to this season I didn't see a Wanderers game for around 2-3 seasons. Simply because my family didn't go. But now that my brother has gone I've fallen in love again. I don't think i'll ever stop seeing Bolton every saturday for the rest of my life now.

This season has really shown what the championship is like. We call came in think it was going to be a breeze but how we was mistaken.

Our first few games with Coyle were hard. They actually fought back and we was losing before we knew it! Case being after more than enough loses, the eventual sacking of Coyle came and here comes Dougie, who not many people gave a chance. But look at us now, we lost out to the playoffs from goal difference. 

**Best player of the Season**

Jay Spearing

By FAR the best player in a Wanderers shirt this season. Just the way he works and plays is sensational. If Liverpool don't want him, can we have him back please?

Dawson was another great player for us and sorely missed on the final game of the season. Would love to have him next season but it looks like WBA want him for keeps.


This season has had everything in it: heartbreak, happiness, joy, tears, hair tearing, ups, downs, you name it!
But what we can take from this is that, we can do it. We can be in the Premier League once again. A few tweaks here and there. And we'll be in the BPL in no time!

**SUPER KEVIN DAVIES**

It was sad to see SKD for the last time today and he also cried on his lap round the Reebok. Truly a legend for the Wanderers and my BWFC hero! I still have my first Bolton shirt with his name on the back somewhere! I wish you the best Kevin. Were ever you go, we will miss you and hope to see you soon again! GOOD LUCK!



I can't wait for the next season to come! what waits, we don't know. But lets get behind Dougie and the boys! 

COME ON YOU WHITE MEN!

**Manchester United player to watch: David de Gea.** When Clint Dempsey scored in the dying seconds at a snowbound White Hart Lane in January, De Gea was burned at the tabloid stake. This was the final straw, the proof that he had no future at Manchester United. Gary Neville joined the throng too in a lengthy TV montage. Four months on, De Gea is recognised as the best 'keeper in the Premier League. Perhaps it started with that save from Mata. His reputation is high, but a warning: Fabien Barthez was goalkeeper of the year at the end of 2000-01 season.

**Chelsea player to watch: Fernando Torres.** British and Irish sports fans are looking forward to this summer's rugby tour to Australia. Tradition dictates that the midweek team, who play the provincial games, are known as the ""dirt-trackers""; Torres, all £50 million of him, has become, with Victor Moses, Chelsea's equivalent, with their fine run of Europa League goals. Torres is perhaps at his happiest yet at Chelsea and though he may only be an impact sub here, he will want to score on the scene of his best day in English football - for Liverpool in 2009 - and his worst - his horror miss for Chelsea in September 2011.

**Key battle: Michael Carrick v David Luiz.** Carrick is another player who has been lauded by his fellow professionals, and rightly so, after a season of high achievement in which he finally became Manchester United's main midfield man. Luiz, with a performance capped by a weaving, dipping wonder strike against Basel, suddenly looks a high-quality midfielder too. His mistakes are more forgivable there and his ability on the ball as well as his defensive class has made his conversion a notable success of the Rafa regime..

We now only have 2 episodes left. It is ridiciculous that it took 6 episodes to get watchable ! Neverthless, I guess it's something.

Either that or the plot doesn't get very intense at all. 

""The Bells of Saint Johns"" never seemed to really put the Doctor in any actual danger, for me it seemed like a fairly easy one for him seeing as we've seen him over god knows how many years hack into everything and anything with a little whiz of the sonic screwdriver.

""The Rings of Akhaten"" entire twist was a bit weak imo - I enjoyed it all up until the planet was killed with the leaf, especially since the first 5 minutes the leaf was drilled into us as if to say ""Hey look at this thing, its important, remember it.""

""Cold War"" I actually really enjoyed, the entire premise was a rock and hard situation - and the way the avoided showing Grand Marshal Skaldak for a very long time built up so much suspense. 

""Hide"" was ok, added more depth to the whole Clara mystery. I'd have like a little more on the creatures from the pocket dimension though. 

""Journey to the Centre of the TARDIS"" I was very excited for, and probably was my favourite of the series so far, seeing the inside of the tardis, and the distaste she has towards Clara was great. 

""The Crimson Horror"" I disliked a lot to be honest - everything happened so quickly, and there didn't seem to be any danger until the last like 5 minutes, to which it was resolved in about 2. The only upside was Strax was great, (as expected).

I just feel they're not quite hitting the mark. Am I the only one thinking this?

Because I'm a teenager I'm generally associated with the really annoying ""omgz im such a nerd, dw 4lyfe"" type of fan, but I really do love this show and it's given me so many new thoughts and insights I never would have had otherwise. So, I really look forward to watching the original show when I can get my hands on it. 

Anyway, 9 was my first Doctor and while I really enjoyed his run, I wasn't particularly awed by him because I didn't see as much of him as I would have liked. 10, however, is *my* Doctor. I'm depressed, anxious, socially awkward, lonely, formerly suicidal, and 10 is everything I have ever wanted in a person... But that there is the problem. He feels like a person, and he's not. While I understand that 11 is generally more eccentric and other-worldly I don't feel I am ready to make the transition from 10 to 11 quite yet, and I'm not sure I want to. Even though 10 seems too human sometimes, I feel like he's my best friend, which maybe sounds pathetic, but it really is true. This show has helped me cope with my problems and life in general, and that's mostly thanks to 10 so I don't know if I can let him go. As 9 said, ""Everything has its time and everything must die."" 

But do I really have to let go or can I pretend that the show ended there and move on with my life?

I noticed in ""Hide"" that the Doctor uses a prop that is straight out of Classic Who, very unusual especially considering the nature of the prop. The blue crystal from Metebelis Three. The same crystal that played an important role in the serial ""Planet of the Spiders"" (Metebelis Three being the name of the spider planet), where the 3rd Doctor (John Pertwee) regenerates to become the 4th Doctor (Tom Baker). If it was just one thing, I wouldn't have payed that much attention and would have written it off as a one-off thing. But then in tonight's episode ""The Crimson Horror"", the Doctor makes an off-hand comment about ""Having to get a gobby Australian from Brisbane to Heathrow"", which is clearly referring to Tegan Jovanka a stewardess from Brisbane trying to get to Heathrow who became a companion to the 4th Doctor very shortly before he regenerated into the 5th Doctor (as well as being a companion to the 5th Doctor for a few seasons).

Bear in mind that Luis Suarez is my favourite striker in the world and I would hate to see him go... I don't think there's any other player in the world with his combination of skill, passion and willingness to run till he drops but I think if he does leave I would like to see either Gomez+cash, Reus or Jovetic..

Despite being dropped from the Bayern starting XI and his age of 27, Mario Gomez is still one of the premier poachers in the world.. His heading, positioning and finishing abilities are top-notch and he would form a deadly duo with Sturridge.. We would also get extra money on top of him to reinforce other areas..

Marco Reus is one of the hottest young stars in world football.. Despite often being deployed on the left for Dortmund, he still scores goals with his net-busting shot power and his lightning pace would be a massive asset.. He apparently has a release clause of around 30mil euros so he's an option, although he would probably prefer to stay at a club with Champion's League football and Dortmund would be loathe to lose any more stars after Gotze's sale and Lewandowski's impending departure...

Lastly, Stevan Jovetic is a hugely talented young striker who resembles Suarez.. Like Luis, Jovetic has the uncanny ability to weave his way through defenses with his superb dribbling ability.. Although he's not as prolific, he is young and has great potential..

Now none of these players is as good as our mercurial Uruguayan at this stage, but I think they would fill a significant amount of the hole his departure would create..

We'll get our Clara explanation that no one saw coming, something HUGE will happen, and apparently it will change the show forever according to Moffat. Not only the finale, the 50th as well is probably where everything in him went. I still like this series, but I can agree to some extent it has been a little meh.

**Match Pointers**

* The last six clashes between these sides in all competitions have featured 29 goals at an average of 4.8 goals per game
* United have lost more games (13) and conceded more goals (55) against Chelsea than versus any other side in the Premier League
* Chelsea have managed one clean sheet in their past 17 league trips to Old Trafford
* Though it is doubtful whether he will feature in this match, of all the players to have played more than 150 Premier League games, the Red Devils' captain, Nemanja Vidic, has the best win percentage of any player, having played 184 and won 136.
* Chelsea skipper John Terry, however, boasts a similarly impressive record as the Blues have won 67 percent of Premier League games with him playing this season and just 48 percent without him.
* We have gained 12 points from losing positions this term and dropped 16 points from winning positions.
* The Blues are eight points better off compared to the corresponding 34 fixtures last season.
* **MILESTONES**

* Frank Lampard needs one goal to equal our all-time top scorer Bobby Tambling on 202.
* If selected, John Terry will make his 550th start for the Blues and Branislav Ivanovic his 200th start in a Blue shirt.
* Ashley Cole's next appearance will be his 50th this season for club and country.
* Congratulations to Yossi Benayoun who celebrates his 33rd birthday (today) Sunday.
* [Congratulation to Rafael Benitez for winning the manager Of The Month For April](http://i.imgur.com/a7YeZZB.jpg)

Yeah, him. He's a Transformer from 1987.

But I've been thinking, of all the toys to put there, why Galvatron? 

So: Here's some random points that could be somewhat significant.

* 1) Galvatron is a reincarnated version of Megatron. Same character, New body. hmm.

* 2) Galvatron has the ability to time jump (it's called that) in the original UK comics.

* 3) In the UK comics, a Bounty Hunter called Death's Head was trying to hunt Galvatron. Well, he failed. He got sucked into the Time Vortex and met the 7th Doctor. 

Well, this made no sense at all. But the show had made me paranoid about every detail. :3

*edit* I made this post for the lols, well at least there were entertaining conversations here. You guys are probably right. Clara is megan fox. 

And no, these information were not specifically dug out for this, as a Tranformers fan, I always wanted to make some form of reference. :3 ",false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,null,null,self,Significance of toy Transformers Galvatron from the last parts of A Crimson Horror...,65,http://www.reddit.com/r/doctorwho/comments/1dqg3n/significance_of_toy_transformers_galvatron_from/
