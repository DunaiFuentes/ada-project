###Match facts:

**Head-to-head**

* The Hammers have kept clean sheets in three of their last four games against Villa, including both of last season's meetings.
* Villa have won just two of their last 14 top-flight games at Upton Park, although eight of those matches ended in draws.

**West Ham United**

* The Hammers have scored in nine successive Premier League games - their best run since a 10-match streak between September and November 2009.
* West Ham have scored eight headed goals in this season's Premier League - more than any other side prior to this weekend.
* Stewart Downing already has twice as many goals (two) and twice as many assists (four) this season as he managed in 32 Premier League games for West Ham in 2013-14.

**Aston Villa**

* Villa have lost their last six games - their worst run in the top flight since a similar sequence between April and August 1964.
* The only time they have endured a longer losing run in the top flight was between March and May 1963, when they suffered 11 consecutive league defeats.
* Andreas Weimann has scored or assisted all but one of Villa's five league goals this season (three goals, one assist).
* Villa have lost 11 of their last 12 Premier League games against London sides. Their only win in that sequence was March's 1-0 victory against Chelsea.

I have Indian descent (Non-Muslim) and well, I'm brown, even if I'm paler than the majority and rather tall at 6'4..and this horribly neutral American accent. I'm heading to London which is possibly the most diverse city in the world, yet my parents have this idea that everyone is from 1700s England and that they'll be racist and so on. I'm not labelling England racist or anything, I have a lot of friends there who are of numerous different backgrounds (Chinese, Jamaican, Barbados, you name it) so, I suppose that really pertains to the question I'm about to ask: Will I be subject to anything?

But now that the season finale (not counting the Christmas special) I am getting more and more scared that Capaldi will not make the next season and Clara will. Does anyone share my light feeling of anxiety?

Ps: I don't have anything against Jenna Coleman, she's an amazing actress and Clara was a good companion in the previous series.

I'm from the Netherlands and the past 16 years I've worked as a joiner on various small to medium sized boatyards. I've worked mostly on steel yachts such as kotters and vletten ranging in size from 30-50 feet. Ever since the economic crisis hit the Netherlands in 2008 the yacht building industry has taken a nose dive and I've been going from one job to the other and I'm getting nowhere.

I've done some research and it looks to me like the yacht building industry in the UK is strong and thriving. I've given it a lot of thought and I've reached the conclusion that if I want something better for myself it's not going to happen in the Netherlands so I've set my sights on the UK. However, I don't have a clue how or where to start. In the Netherlands we have the HISWA which basically is a Dutch association of yacht builders. Is there anything like that in the UK? And if so, would they be willing to help me in my search for a job? Maybe there are recruitment agencies who specialize in this kind of work?

I do want to stress I'm not looking to leech off the UK. I love working as a joiner on small boatyards and given my extensive experience as a joiner I think I have a lot to offer and could make a positive contribution to the UK's yacht building industry.

And we all can see it isn't working. I think the reason is that we're using 3 non-creative midfielders which leads me to Gerrard. I think everyone knows that Gerrard is not the long term solution anymore. I did say in the start of the season that we should give him time and not drop him from our best XI too soon. 

However, I'm starting to think that it doesn't benefit us enough to have him as the main defensive midfielder anymore. He has to be accompanied by two hard-working midfielders (Henderson, Allen or Can) who can support the attack as well as help out the defence. Otherwise we will put extra pressure on Gerrard and leave the defence more vulnerable. That, however, means that both of the extra midfielders are box-to-box and we are short of attacking power. 

I think that having an actual defensive midfielder could give us enough room to push one of the extra midfielders forward and therefore replace the box-to-box position with attacking mid. It could be mainly Lallana or Coutinho (if we use Sterling there then we don't have good enought wingers to play that system). 

4-5-1 absolutely needs an attacking midfielder. The system is built up to have two controlling midfielders that leave room attacking midfielder. It seems extremely pointless to have three midfielders that don't attack. Today was a good example. We always seemed short of bodies up front. Can got froward but he isn't really a goalscorer and isn't very creative. 

I imagine that the decision to have Gerrard as DMF was made because he isn't mobile enough to play more forward and lacks technique to operate in tight spaces. Let's face it, he isn't getting any better. That move pushed the decision to drop him further into the future. 

I mean Lucas is slow and was pushed back hard with these two injuries but he's still a great tackler and has good positional sense. Also, his short passing is much better than Gerrard's. He can find pockets of space that Gerrard often won't try. I think his long passing, free-kick deliveries won't be too big of a miss as he has been quite wasteful this season.

So, when do we see our first match when we don't play Gerrard because of footballing reasons? Will it be this season? Or after he has left Liverpool? 

I expected the transition to take place this season but it seems that Rodgers wanted more years out of him. Although, Gerrard's recent statement about his contract was a bit weird. 

That said, I think it's still somewhat viable to use him in a diamond.

But at the end of the game, i double checked whether Fabregas had been subbed off. He's been destroying teams for the whole of the season and Hendo shut the guy down, which i was very impressed by, and something i hadn't considered part of his game before. 

Is it worth having him on the team purely for man marking reasons, nullifying creative players. If not, what should be his role on the team?

Can we see him moving into a more defensive role like Gerrard? He certainly has the engine for it, and his long passes have been getting better. Perhaps he'd be better distributing the ball than receiving it.

But I love the fact that you are shaking up the top 6. Go Saints! Though please ease up on is next time ;)

But be honest now where did you guys see yourself after 11 matches?

""Is this the time i remind people it's 5 years and one month since Rodgers was sacked as Reading manager bottom of the championship? No? Ok

Those who dont know the story behind Rodgers sacking at Reading better read up cause the similarities behind his behaviours are startling...

Rodgers took over Reading summer of 2009. Given 'substantial funds' in the summer window to 'build upon' success left by Steve Coppell...

Less than 6 mths later he was sacked. Chairman stated 'understand not had much time but we got on a slipperily slope and just got worse'

Chairman 'Signings didnt settle, Rodgers was adamant his style of play would eventually work. Results kept getting worse, performances too'

Chairman 'results &amp; performances did not match what the manager was consistently telling me. The fans started to tell me a different story'

Chairman 'Rodgers refused to comprehend the notion of changing his ways so adamant was he that he would be successful'""

          I found Danny's speech at the end the most bad ass moment in the season, however i felt his acting was abysmal and ruined the speech.
          This is my idea for the ending: Captain Jack is picked up by unit, to be the military adviser to the Doctor when is made the president. However, when the plane was taken down by the cybermen Jack got 'killed.' The rain caused Jack to be converted but due to his immortality the emotional inhibitor didn't work. Danny saves Clara and ends up in the graveyard. It continues as written in the episode until his emotional inhibitor is activated. At which point, Danny gives the Doctor the information then tries to kill the Doctor. Clara kills Danny and becomes traumatized by the experience. Missy arrives and does her safety speech, when Missy gives the Doctor the army, he has his moment of realization and gives the army to the cyberman who didn't follow orders, this being capt. jack, he removes the faceplate and makes some vain comment. Here he gives the speech then burns the clouds. Shrapnel falls too Earth one of which being jack's head, the Doctor takes that and turns him into The Face Of Boe.

That was a twist that caught me off guard. That being said, this story could have been *a lot* more interesting and impactful with a couple basic changes to the plan.

1) The clouds aren't a danger to living people, they only convert the dead. Having the clouds there gave the doctor an easy out, a way to get rid of the problem without having to deal with the reprecusions. 

2) Missy should have ordered the Cybermen to exterminate the human race in X minutes (however many needed), *then* given her speal about gifting the Doctor an army, and then handed him the bracelet *forcing* him to give them an order - stand down.

3) The bracelet should have been keyed to timelord phsyiology, and only worked for a timelord. Destroying the bracelet should cause the cybermen to revert to their usual mentality (UPGRADE ALL THE THINGS).

This would have forced the doctor to give at least one order. He wouldn't have had a choice. Sure it would be innocuous, but it's a start. After that what can he do. If he doesn't give any more orders then all the dead on earth just sort of stand around waiting, it doesn't solve the problem. He could order them to self-destruct, except here's the thing - they aren't just robots, they've got the minds of human beings inside them. The doctor *could* do it, but would he? Destrying the bracelet isn't an option because they'd start attacking. So what choice does he have?

It's Sunday, and it's time to let things you don't love go to a great home.

All exchanges are done at your own risk. As this is a UK sub, we're working under the assumption that most people here will be in the UK, or at least the EU. But if the seller is willing to ship internationally, we won't stop you :)

If you have flair on any other exchange subreddits, feel free to include them in your post! 

Happy swapping and selling! 

####Posting Guidelines

1. You're free to exchange whatever you like, however we recommend you avoid exchanging anything in a tub or with a roller ball, or anything that forces you to dip your finger or part of the product back into itself. This is to prevent bacterial spreading and contamination.
2. Every swap must include a picture of the items neatly arranged, with a piece of paper with your username and the date.
3. Please include the products full name, whether you're selling or exchanging and if the price includes shipping.
4. If you are looking to exchange only, please list what you're willing to exchange for.
5. If you are looking to sell, please list your asking price along with your preferred payment method.
6. Please specify how much of the product has been used. If you can't do this (like with a closed bottle that has a pump) in the picture, please give an estimation of how much has been used in your text post. ""Used twice"", ""About 60% left"" are good ways to describe it.
7. If you are selling opened products, please specify roughly when you opened the product along with the expiration date. On most products this is in the form of a tub with a number then an M. [Example](http://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s--v1uJsL4e--/c_fit,fl_progressive,q_80,w_636/1971otk9noyiojpg.jpg). 
8. Please do not swap prescription medications. These posts will be removed.
9. Please post in the comments so people can know what's actually still up for grabs. Use PM when you're finalising the swap.
10. If someone doesn't fulfil their end of the exchange, let us know.
11. Ship within a week and keep the receipt as proof of postage. 
12. Wait till the other person has received their items before you start using what they sent you.

In the time of Matt Smith she was very much joyful and up for everything, but throughout this season she seems to just want to tell The Doctor what to do and I feel that such a powerful being as a Time Lord would have the capacity to deal with it, but the way its been written he seems to be baffled by her mood swings and high aggression towards him.

I feel that is been more about her than The Doctor this season, which surprised me with a new regeneration because Capaldi is a fantastic actor and I feel they've made him look more like a cowering pup.

I'm glad that Clara (hopefully) will be leaving. She has done nothing but bore me.

I've seen a lot of people talking about her more recently, and I was wondering what your opinion of her was, and whether you feel my statement is just.

*Capaldi however is on-par the best Doctor (in my opinion) that there has ever been, he has the mannerisms of an older Tennant but lacking the empathy.

TLDR: Clara has been a sulky, boring, selfish and controlling character this season, undermining Capaldi as the new doctor.

Introducing a new Doctor is always something difficult for both the fans saying goodbye to the old doctor and opening their arms to the new one; and for the cast, particularly the new Doctor who I’d imagine would feel a lot of pressure.

In terms of the series's main characters, producers had made a bold choice in choosing Peter Capaldi as the doctor but I think he delivered. He brought back a little “Classic Doctor” essence: Capaldi's Doctor is not just older but looks to be drier in his humor, more reticent, not as giddy or as the other doctors like Matt, more cold blooded and dangerous. From my point of view, that’s interesting and in some aspects an improvement. ""Time Heist"" had a distinct flavor of excellent Doctor Who writing in which Capaldi flourished and really felt like the Doctor and he did it with his own style. In ""Mummy on the Orient Express"" it was classic whovian wonder and suspense and Capaldi really shined in the episode.

So...Clara...Now from what I've heard, everybody hates Clara….but I don’t. I think she has became one of my top five companions. She adds a little comedy and realism to the program and I know she had one or two breakdowns or rants to the Doctor this series but they were necessary. The Doctor needs to be put in his place sometimes and I think Clara is great at making that happen. (But nobody could do it like Donna  ) I think she is a strong and clever character and we can see this in episodes like “Flatline” Clara had a sad end too, saying goodbye to Danny although I always thought Coleman and Anderson truly had zero chemistry. No doubt we’ll see Clara again soon.

Now let’s discuss the elephant in the room...Missy! Some though that her being the Master was inevitable and I always saw it as a possibility, but Moffat didn’t have too many routes to take with her (I had my money on her being the Rani but I was wrong...as usual) but I was happy nonetheless with who she turned out to be. Missy was killing people left, right and center! Osgood died (I don’t care...she irritates me). Kate Stewart nearly died if it wasn't for her father saving her (And can we just talk about what a heartwarming cyberman-cameo from the brigadier that was. He finally got the Doctor to salute! :D) Now there were bits of the Missy explanation that will earn further investigation. She was, as had been suspected by a lot of people, the woman who gave Clara the TARDIS phone number back in “The Bells Of Saint John”, although why did Clara not recognise her? I saw Missy’s motivation was interestingly, loneliness; something we've seen the Doctor wrestle with over the past few years. Now I hated John Simm and the Doctor Who Movie’s masters but I think Gomez played the Master perfectly!

My episode summaries :):
Deep Breath: the season premiere was for me...meh...a middling story that’s concerned mainly with introducing the new Doctor with Clara. Although it was cool to see Vastram, Jenny and Strax again. 3/5

Into The Dalek: good although a little childish with a play on a shrink ray to get inside the dalek. 3/5

Robot Of Sherwood: As a fan of the Robin Hood story I thought it was great. The duel at the start was funny and the ending was very entertaining too. 4/5

Listen: I got many chills. This episode had a creepy and ghostly tone and I think it’s subject will in someway return. Interesting to see past and future Danny. Very enjoyable. 4/5

Time Heist: One o’ my favourites! Real Doctor Who vibes from this episode. The doctor’s associates in the episode slowly dropping made it a good watch. Really cool alien and villain as well. The return of the memory worm was a nice touch too. 5/5

The Caretaker: Not the best of the series, Danny’s introduction to the world of the doctor. The robot villain seemed a bit filler-ish though. I got a flashback to when Tennant when back to school in his first series. 2/5

Kill The Moon: School girl Courtney is now on the Tardis and she’s annoying. I feel like she was an unnecessary edition to the storyline. Good concept without moon being an egg although. Clara has her biggest break down yet and we think that we’ll never see her again…(We don’t even see her in the next episode’s trailer) Scariest episode yet...damn my arachnophobia… 4/5

Mummy On The Orient Express: Another of my favourites from the series. Nice idea and cool memorable line - “Those that bear the Foretold stare have 66 seconds to live” Great enemy, simple yet effective. We also see that Clara is staying! Yay! 5/5

Flatline: Yet a further great episode. An enemy that we have never seen the like of before and one that is very hard to fight..but easy to fool. Clara takes over for the episode too  4/5

In The Forest Of The Night: This episode is very mixed for me. I thought at some points the kids were annoying but at others a nice touch. Also, Trees... a threat that turns out to be a safety measure. I found it okay but nothing special. 2/5

Dark Water/Death In Heaven: The finale!!! Cybermen return..sounding really menacing, Missy has her...moments with the doctor. Great storyline, the world was saved (duh), but 'Death in Heaven' offered no happy endings...at all. Clara says goodbye to Danny, Missy dies and the Doctor has his first RAAGE when he finds Missy has lied about Galifrey. A superb ending to the series.

In conclusion of Capaldi...""Times change, and so must I."" These words were part of the last speech of the 11th Doctor, who just so happens to also be my favorite doctor. The transition from one doctor to the next is never easy, but the constant alteration is part of what makes the show great. To be honest, it took me a while to warm up to the new doctor, especially considering his prickly-ness when compared to the 10th and 11th. However, by the episodes ""Listen"" and ""Mummy On The Orient Express"" I feel he has won me over. Where he will rank overall is still to be determined, but I am excited to see where the show takes us. I give the series a solid 8/10.

It is established in 'Listen' that Clara is the great-great Grandmother of the time traveler Orson Pink upon him hinting at his time traveling lineage and handing Clara the family heirloom, the same solider she gives to Danny Pink as a child.  So obviously at some point in the year-ish she and Danny are together they get it on produce a child that then goes on to have more lineage and produces Orson. We know as a fact from this current finale Dark Water/ Death in Heaven that Danny Pink does die, and dies again for real this time as a cyberman, thus he would not go on to have children unless he'd already conceived a child within Clara. 

Now throughout series 8 there have been plenty of 'Clara is prego- or going to be be prego' hints and inferences. 

In Kill the Moon, a whole episode about fertility and the protection of an unborn child, Clara has the fun task of trying to decide if the egg-moon-alien-dragon's life is worth saving in the face of the possibility of ending the human race. This is our first smoking gun- 



LUNDVIK: Oh, you want to talk about babies?. You've probably got babies down there now. You want to have babies?
CLARA: Well, yeah.
COURTNEY: Mister Pink.
CLARA: Shush! 



Granted the exchange is short but it's foreshadowing and leading her back to the conclusion of her great-great grandson Orson and tying the idea back to she and Danny  having kids. 



In Forest of the Night, once again a child-centric episode, at the end when the world is safe and mother and daughter are reunited ...and a magical bush brings back a lost child (let's just forget that part happens shall we) -- the doctor and Clara are talking; 



CLARA: We are not going to forget an overnight forest.
DOCTOR: You forgot the last time. You remembered the fear and you put it into fairy stories. It's a human superpower, forgetting. If you remembered how things felt, you'd have stopped having wars. And stopped having babies.



On the line 'and stopped having babies' the shot was square on Clara's face implying once again the pregnancy to come. 



At this point before I had seen any further episodes I was certain the series would end with Clara telling the Doctor she was pregnant --- which I think she was TRYING to when they met in Death in Heaven for their 'goodbye' talk but she couldn't bring herself to tell him about Danny. We see her in the shot when she says 'Never again' that she is staring off at a very pink and fun and purposefully zoomed in on Merry-Go-Round-- because even though she no longer has Danny she will never again go on adventures like she had before because of her pregnancy and impending child. 



I think in the Christmas episode she'll either be far along in her pregnancy and big as a house or already have the infant child (if they conceived in say... march then it could be plausible- the scenes were in nice weather but not summer weather implying early spring) 




TLDR: Clara is totally preggers and they've hinted at it all season and in the christmas episode she'll be big as a house.

There’s a show that Lindsay and I like called Dr. Who.



The main character, aptly named the Doctor, is an alien, a Timelord from the planet Gallifrey who travels through time and space in a blue police box called a TARDIS.  He does this for a variety of reasons, mostly to learn, to meet historical figures and to help people; always intending to do good.



Obviously, in time travel, both to the past and the future, making changes will change the future of that past…



Except, we learn, that the Doctor can’t always change things.  There are some events throughout the history and the future of time and space that are fixed. These fix points are so important, that changing them will make anything to follow completely unrecognizable: the eruption of Mt. Vesuvius, the sinking of the Titanic, the beginning and end of any great war.  These things are so engrained as events in the history and culture of our people that altering them would forever change the face of what it means to be human or alien, in the case of our Doctor.



Now – I’m not a big believer in fate, or destiny – and to be honest, as much as I like to believe in time travel, I don’t necessarily think that that’s possible either; although inter-dimensional travel may in fact just prove to be travel to alternate timelines within our own reality, but I digress.



The whole point to this story, besides trying to get other people to watch this show so I can talk to you about it, are these fixed points.  I can’t speak to the whole of humanity, but I can say at least within my frame of consciousness that fixed points are a real thing.  I’m standing in the middle of one right here. 



And Lindsay, my love, I didn’t know it then, but I know it today, so incredibly well, that that first day we met, in studio B of Dempster hall, that was a fixed point.  That first time I looked into your beautiful eyes, kissed your sweet lips, the first time we held hands, or said I love you.  When you, me, Dan and the bugs moved into that apartment.  When we came to New Jersey – those are all fixed points in my life.  Without them, without you, I would be a shell of who you see today.  You are so important not only to me, but to my existence, who I am – that in your absence, I would be nothing.  You are my whole heart. 



I vow to you, in front of all of those we love, that I will take no other – that I am yours completely, that nothing can drive us apart and that our bond together will keep us strong no matter what the universe throws at us.  I vow that I will honor and obey.  I promise that I will give you everything you need and try my damndest to give you everything that you want.  And I swear that we’ll have many fixed points to come.  And I promise, that when we’re old and grey and fading into the dark that we’ll look back and say – “what an amazing life we made – together.”",false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,null,null,self,My wedding vows,9,http://www.reddit.com/r/doctorwho/comments/2lqdgf/my_wedding_vows/

Just turned 20, still living at home and I'm lucky enough that my parents don't ask for rent money from me, mostly due to my low wages. 

To supplement my not so good wages over the last few years I have had more joy in saving my money rather than spending it and almost consider it as a hobby.

Anyway at the moment I have 11K in a TSB cash ISA paying out between 1 &amp; 2 percent annually (Can't check the specifics right now as the TSB site is down.) And I have just over 1k in a regular current account, and my out going bills are only around £85 per month and I'm earning roughly £600 per month.

So what I'd like to find out if what I'm about to do is advisable and doesn't clash with any t'c and c's of the 123 account. 

As most of you will know that to qualify for the account you need to deposit at least £500 per month and not from internal accounts, meaning only money coming in from your job or in cash go towards the £500. 

So I wanted to know if I could transfer from TSB to Santander but with only £7000 and use the additional £5000 I have, to pay towards the required £500 per month just in case I lose my job or any other unforeseen circumstances, but what I don't know is where I would move the extra £5000 to so I could drip feed it in, besides keeping it in my house*.

Long story short: Can I transfer from tsb to the Santander with £7000 of my £12000 savings and use the remaining £5000 to insure I always reach the minimum quota per month. Or will santander ask for the full amounts held with TSB during the switch ?

*I would never consider keeping £5000 in cash in my home, just that I'm not exactly sure where I could put it in the mean time, and as I type this I feel this is bordering on money laundering which is not my goal I just need a little guidance haha.

But what I think is more interesting is how the legend of Santa can be explained by being a timelord. Santa (by how children know him) has been around for a very long time. If he were a timelord, this would easily explain how long he's been on earth. Also, everyone always asks ""How does Santa get to all the houses in the world in one night?"" Well, it wouldn't be too difficult he he had a device that could travel through time and space, i.e. a TARDIS! And to have a sack that can hold all the presents in the world?

I'm desperately trying to identify which episode the following scene belongs to. Forgive me if I'm not being specific enough. 

Its a moment when Ten is talking about travelling alone. He is asked by an older man if he has anyone to travel with, or if he minds being alone, and ten answers something along the lines of:
'I used to have someone but now she's gone. I thought things would be better this way.' 
And then he hangs his head in his hands. 

In the background there seem to be Christmas trees and the like, so I'm not sure if it's a Christmas special. I've had a look at them all after 'Doomsday' and can't seem to find this scene. 

I caught this little snippet of the scene in a doctor who fan video which of course, now I cannot find to even take a screenshot to help me identify when the scene occurs. 

Any help would be much appreciated!!

I haven't wanted to smoke any, and I've been pretty deep in thought. I'm not even sure about what. Just about life, and being a man (not just being manly per say). Maybe I mean just being a good person. Eh, its weird. My brain is weird. 

I'm still happy, most definitely, I'm great mentally. I really want to do some self improvement though (mainly physically). I want to be a warrior in body and thought. My roomate always plays the tv, and I think to myself : ""What kind of life is that?"" He comes home from work, smokes weed, watches netflix, and does some school work. 

I don't get it. There is so much to life, and I feel like I'm on the verge of just understanding it all. Nirvana in a sense, hahaha, maybe not quite that awesome. I mean, if that makes him happy, that's fantastic, but how? Life is grand, you can miss a lot.

I kind of want to go live in a cabin for a month. I want to grow my hair out, I want to cut trees again. I want to sit down by a fire, drink liquor, read a book, make love, just exist and love life.

Have I mentioned I love you guys? You've helped me so much.

I read a story recently, ""A Masculine Confession"", and it really clicked with me. Through the narrator it comments on the dual nature of being a man. You have to be stoic, fight, and be out for yourself, yet you have to think, be compassionate, and emote. Mixing the two is what makes you human, and the skill with which you meld them is what makes a man (At least thats how I feel). Can I defend myself and my family, yet at the end of the day sit down and dispense advice to my neighbor? Scroll in one hand, axe in the other.

I feel the pressure in my chest. Its like a fist. You guys really are awesome though. Mmmmmm, I think I'm done ranting now.

Guys, give me your insight on life. What's your take on it all? I really value your wisdom.

Love ya

But their records are incomplete, and sadly many memorials (especially rural ones) are degrading: someday the information on them may be lost.

You can help, and it's really easy. First, find your nearest local war memorial at http://www.ukniwm.org.uk/server/show/nav.23 - just search in your town or village and you'll find one. See if it appears and if the information is complete: some records barely show that the memorial is there, others have full lists of names, but many are in-between, merely listing which wars are represented.

Then head out to the memorial and take photos of all sides of it, close enough that you can read all of the text. In the top right corner of the page about your town's memorial, there's a link to provide updated information: just type in the new details that you found and send it off. Or, if your memorial wasn't in the database at all, send them an email.

This Rememberance Sunday you can do more for the memory of those killed in war by helping future generations remember and research, too.

The particulars of my situation are:

**Location**: Greater Glasgow. I just finished my MSc (in August), and I was living with one of my parents whilst studying, as it would have been very expensive otherwise. I'm a 25 year old male, having

**Income**: £21k per annum as a graduate geologist (in a fairly in-demand speciality) working in a company which employs about 30 people. Net monthly income ~£1435.

**Savings**: small private pension, £900 in a short-term savings account and £5,500 in an ISA. I have a credit card which I use for infrequent, small online purchases, and which I pay off immediately.

**Debts**: none.

I am currently considering whether to start renting a flat or whether to buy a small, cheap house in one of the satellite towns around Glasgow (Cumbernauld, for example). There are an abundance of flats and small houses &lt;£50,000 in these areas, and I have a feeling that getting on the property ladder early is probably a good decision. Renting in Glasgow would probably be a minimum of £400pcm excluding council tax and bills.

Any and all advice/criticism is welcome!

This is one of those rounds where you loved/hated an episode, loved/hated characters, loved/hated themes, loved/hated the season as a whole.  I think this is simply due  to the different feel and tone of the show.  Yes, plot twists abound but what season of doctor who didn't contain many to some degree.  

But the more pragmatic doctor, an active companion with conflicts about the time lord, the themes of soldierism/lying/death, really made this (for me) one of the more compelling series so far.

1)  Mind if someone clarify for me the thematic importance of the soldier this series?  The whole aristocratic, officer role that Danny pointed out is something to consider, especially in regards to his comments of keeping his hands clean.  From what I can glean, the simple fact is that he is pragmatic and does tend to use people to complete a mission, saving lives of course, but not the core objective.  The whole speech of fear being important to Danny Cyberman only for him to counter back that in order to solve the Cyberman problem he had to lose the fear anyway was really heartbreaking.  But what did people think of Danny's comments on the Doctor's speeches falling away? 

2)  I think I read somewhere on this reddit that there were fan-edits and reworkings of past seasons, particularly season 6 (in my opinion, rightly so).  I hope there will be some on this series.

So there is enough interest to buy a box and split it, but seeing as im planning on ordering on Monday I need people to confirm exactly what they want.  Also if you want in on the split now is the last time to speak up.

So people that are in so far:

/u/dageshi for at least 4 if not more **CONFIRMED FOR ~~10~~ 12**

/u/ecosse4ever for 2 **CONFIRMED**

/u/methane89 for 3

/u/troublesome961 for 3 **CONFIRMED**

/u/Dead_Ghost for ~~2~~ **4** **CONFIRMED**

/u/CoreNecro for 3 **CONFIRMED**

/u/fidelcabro for 4 **CONFIRMED**

~~So thats 21 so far, I wanted to get half a box for myself and so that leaves another 9 up for grabs.  If nobody wants them then I guess I could eat the cost of that myself but would rather not so if people are willing to help out and buy one or 2 extra that would be appreciated.~~ Thanks for taking up the slack guys, love you all

Reminder of costs per stick: £3.20 each plus a £3.50 postage cost per shipment for anything up to 5 sticks and £5 shipping for more than that, for example 3 sticks would be £9.60 + £3.50 for a total of £13.10 whereas 8 would be £25.60 + £5 shipping so £30.60

So, the people on the list above please get back to me most asaply with a confirmed yes for your interest and the number of sticks that you want and will need payment by bank transfer (i'll pm my details to people once they have confirmed their order) by 6 pm on monday, although if youre verified and need some time I can order before you pay on a case by case basis but will need payment before I ship to you.",false,ukcigars,t5_33cs8,null,null,self,Jamie Garcia Reserva Especial Robusto Group Buy Update,5,http://www.reddit.com/r/ukcigars/comments/2lr3vt/jamie_garcia_reserva_especial_robusto_group_buy/

Imagine there's an Elvis impersonator. The real one's been dead for a while, so you have to make do with an imitation, but hey! It could be worse, right? 

But it is worse. Not only does this Elvis keep slipping in his own turgid tunes into the set list, which aren't very Elvis-like at all, but he keeps dropping hints about reaching a crescendo (*Blue Suede Shoes*, perchance?) that he never delivers. Instead, he likes adding things to the mix that Elvis never featured at all, like kazoo solos or moments on a stradivarius in a bath which are supposed to make him look 'iconic' or up to date, but just make him look silly.

In fact, the more the increasingly nonsensical set progresses, the more you realise this Elvis isn't as important as, say, the Priscilla impersonator who keeps storming onto the stage, disrupting the set and shouting at him. Apparently, people come to see Elvis impersonators because they're more interested in Priscilla, or something (at least according to the Elvis impersonator).

And when he dusts off his old favourite *Jail House Rock*, or rather, doesn't, you begin to see the real problem. This Elvis impersonator really hates Elvis; he'd much rather feature his own crazy ideas which have nothing to do with the King, and wouldn't pass muster in any other context. In fact, the only reason why this plonker has an audience at all is because people have turned up to see Elvis and are having to make do with him instead. 

The real climax comes when the impersonator digs up the real Elvis' grave and then projectile vomits into it, relentlessly. In between, he keeps telling the audience that Elvis is actually rubbish, but still, keep turning up to watch the impersonator because it's Elvis. Look, here's another tune you might remember, but really butchered and messed around with. 

The set closes as the Elvis Impersonator sits on the toilet and pretends to die, only to then jump up and projectile vomit into the grave again. Why? Because he's the only Elvis in town, and he can do what he likes, and that's what the public have come to see, especially the newer fans who lap this sort of thing up, for some bizarre reason. 

The Elvis impersonator then fills in the grave and starts jumping up and down on it, cackling malevolently, while all the fanbois and fangurlz all quickly gurgle on Twitter that this is 'The Best Elvis EVAR', and then the Elvis impersonator desecrates Christmas by shooting Rudolf the Red-Nosed Reindeer in the head. Applause.

And that, dear reader, was what *Death in Heaven* was - the only way it could have topped itself is if the Elvis impersonator got Michael Grade onstage and forced everyone at gunpoint to give him a standing ovation.

I'm
willing to admit I might be too stupid to understand.  But I either need to know if I'm wrong or if anyone else is wondering the same thing cause it's all driving me mad.  Here are a few of my problems that the show just doesn't seem to be addressing.


What about the crack on Trenzalore?


It was my understanding that Gallifrey was projecting a message through a crack that came out on Trenzalore. ""Doctor Who?""  The Doctor simply had to speak his true name to the crack and Gallifrey would have come out right then and there.  
       That was the whole problem.  If it did, it would have kickstarted another Time War. So he stayed here for 600 something years to protect the crack from all it's attackers.  He gets a regeneration cycle from the crack eventually and destroys all the threats around Trenzalore.
      So what about the crack? It didn't close to my recollection.  Why isn't he just speaking his name to the crack in Trenzalore?  Why are we even looking for Gallifrey?  It's right there.  This is perhaps my biggest question/problem.


How did The Master escape?


There's no explanation how he escaped the pocket dimension that holds Gallifrey.  If he can slip out of it, then why can't the other Timelords?


The episode has two plot devices that they used just for the trailer.


Two things in the last two episodes that were simply there for drama and to use in the trailer to make you think ""Oh my God what?!""  Clara betraying the doctor and Clara saying ""There was no Clara Oswald!""  These are two plot devices that really, didn't go anywhere at all.  They could have been cut from the episodes and nothing would have changed.  They are essentially trailer lies to make you think more is going on than there actually is.  I hate this kind of stuff.


Why did Missy pair up Clara and The Doctor again?


Her whole plan in general I really didn't understand.  And this might be due to me being stupid or overlooking something.  What was the purpose of setting up Clara and the Doctor?  It didn't do anything for her.  It didn't do anything for her plan.  It really ended up having no effect at all except for us to think The Master had this grand conspiracy.  But it didn't go anywhere.

There are more but answers to these questions (if there are any) might resolve the others.  And again, I  might be too stupid to understand. I'm fully ready to admit that, but I'm just so damn confused as to what the hell is going on anymore.  I appreciate any help anyone can give or any CLARA-fication. HA!

I asked one of the staff why this was, to which she replied, ""We don't like it either, basically because the higher ups know that it's going to be a popular film, they're charging extra to get more money out of you."" I found this despicable. They are giving The Hunger Games 3 and The Hobbit 3 the same treatment as well. 

I understand IMAX costs more, that's okay, but if I were to see Interstellar on a tiny screen at the back, it would still be £1 more. 

I tweeted Odeon about this asking for an explanation and they said ""We charge more during the busy periods so we can charge less during the quiet periods :)"" I am not happy about this practice and I wish to complain somewhere where my voice will be heard and taken into consideration.

I first went to them when I was 20 with my acne problem and was given a treatment of 5 Isolaz laser acne treatment, which actually worked! It got rid of all the bad pimples and made my skin a lot better.

Ive also used their peel service as well, where I started by doing Glycolic peels and then moving up to SA peels. But I found these far too harsh on my skin and they were doing more damage than good and I realised that I would see better results by doing daily small doses of AHA and BHAs over continued use.

Customer service there is really good where they are nice and treat you well and you able to ask them any questions that you want and they explain what they are going to do to you very clearly and they always make sure that you're not experiencing any pain during the procedure.

They also have nurses and dermatologists on hand as well if you would like to seem them opposes to the ""Therapist"" that you are given.

***************
**Gamecast:**

* 1: We're underway!
* 3: We're closing Stoke down with incredible pace, very good energy levels from the team.
* 4: What a chance! What great play! Eriksen picks up the ball and runs 15 yards before playing a fantastically weighted ball to Chadli who takes two Stoke players out of the equation with a burst of pace and chips the ball to the far post, a flying Kane heads it goalwards but Begovic handles it well.
* 5: Diouf on the floor, delay in the game. Begovic cleared the ball up field and Lloris leaps to claim it and clatters Diouf in the process. He does get up and jogs off the field though.
* 6: **Stoke have scored**. Bojan picks up the ball in his own half, streaks towards goal, everyone backs off and he gets a free shot at goal from outside the box which goes past Lloris. 0-1 to Stoke.
* 8: Bardsley seems to have a groin strain. Geoff Cameron is coming on for Bardlsey for Stoke intermittently.
* 12: Kaboul decides to bring the ball up into the final third and loses it. He does that way too often, this is not the time for this shit Younes.
* 14: Great work by Chadli to push a Stoke player off the ball, run to goal and find Eriksen. Eriksen wins a free kick after being fouled about 35-40 yards from goal. He's lining up the kick...
* 14: He goes for it! A few yards over there. Come on lads, let's get two quick goals.
* 16: Kaboul and Fazio trying to be the playmakers here, goal kick for Stoke after a half cooked effort. Really need Mason, Chadli and Eriksen on the ball here.
* 17: Poch is reading this thread. Kaboul brings the ball up again and Poch screams, ""STAY! STAY! STAY HERE!"" to him.
* 19: Incredibly frustrating from Kaboul. He smacks a long ball trying to find Kane but it's way too far ahead for him and it goes out of play. Stoke take their time with the goal kick.
* 22: Townsend with a 60 yard run and Cameron chops him down. Yellow card.
* 23: Eriksen plays a quick one to Mason who takes a few steps at goal and smacks it, it skims off the side-netting.
* 23: Begovic taking a **HUGE** amount of time with every single goal kick.
* 24: The ref has had enough! Yellow for Begovic for time wasting! There is some justice!
* 25: Looks like Wilson might be coming off for Stoke as well, he seems to be struggling with an injury. Muniesa is stripped and ready to come on.
* 29: Terrible defending from Kaboul and Fazio, a needless corner conceded. It's time a combination without Kaboul was tried in the center of defense for us.
* 33: **Absolutely fucking pathetic. Stoke have scored again. Such bollocks.** Lazy ball out from Rose, Shawcross heads the ball back into the area, Rose has lost his man, Diouf easily picks out Jonathan Walters who side foots the ball past Lloris. 0-2 to Stoke. Fucking disgrace.
* 36: Dembele needs to come in place of Capoue to bring a little more fluidity in the midfield. Stoke are now showing a lot more urgency with the ball and passing it around.
* 37: Stoke fans chanting ""Ole!"" with each touch of the ball, and Begovic obliges with a misplaced pass out of the ground.
* 38: We're sitting too deep in our half, we need to push up a lot more.
* 39: Mason finds a neat ball through to Chadli, but by the time he gets his shot away there are a few Stoke players crowding him out. Corner.
* 41: Careless passing, poor pressing, bad possession, zero movement, no closing down. That goal deflated us way too much, we started with such great energy and purpose.

**********************

Alright lads, new tactic. Going to be positive before the second half starts, we can do this. COME ON. As long as Capoue makes way for Dembele please.


* 45: Two changes in the half. Dembele comes on for Eriksen and Lamela on for Townsend.
* 52: Kaboul picks up the ball in midfield, takes it all the way to the left corner flag and concedes a goal kick. I don't know what to say any more to this guy, I really don't.
* 57: Lamela trying to make things happen but there is just no speed and pace in the side. Everyone is static, wants the ball delivered to their feet.
* 59: Great dead ball delivery from Lamela and Kane has a free header which goes wide.
* 63: Nothing happening. Capoue shoots from 45 yards out. Ade is coming on, probably for Kane or Chadli. Would be better if he replaced Kane, Kane's done nothing today.
* 64: Incredible. Ade replaces Capoue.
* 66: Ade's first contribution is to pass the ball to Diouf who launches a counter attack.
* 66: Stoke are now going to be Stoke. Pieters is on the floor buying some time.
* 72: Sorry guys, but Kaboul could score a hat-trick and I'd still be mad at him. He takes the ball and runs up with it, he obviously loses it and he slides in frustration and picks up a yellow. Ridiculous.
* 76: Fantastic free kick from Lamela and the cunt Begovic saves.
* 78: **WHAT A GOAL BY CHADLI! FANTASTIC FINISH!** Rose chips the ball up to the far post and Chadli SMACKS the volley into the back of the net - ABSOLUTELY STUNNING!
* 85: Naughton has been sent off. Moses was home and clear and Naughton had to bring him down. This causes further complications for us at RB. Hope those rumors about Walker returning after the international break are true.
* 86: Lloris screams that he wants the ball, but Fazio tries to clear, he gives it straight to Ireland who volleys at goal but Lloris saves.
* 90: Some spectacular stuff from Danny Rose here. A blunder from Kaboul and Fazio causes Stoke to streak away for a counter attack, and Rose races back, tackles and gets an attack going, and he eventually wins a free kick half a yard outside the box. Well done Danny boy.
* 90: Ridiculous call from the ref, Lamela jumps higher than Shawcross and Shawcross somehow is fouled.

I would rate it the same as the season with Martha as companion.
Why is that?

First of all, after seeing the season 7 finale and 50th aniversary episode, it was really difficult to keep such a high level of quality. Season 7 was just gorgeous for me. Because of the quality of actors and ideas, but also because there was a plot line. Those weren't just random chapters with random events that have little to do with each other, but all was connected and when you saw it all was connected your mind was just MIND = BLOWN.

But in the 8th season the randomness came back. Of course there was a ""plot"" with seeing Missy at the end of almost every chapter, but hey, that's not really a plot. That's a little 10 second teaser at the end of every chapter, and most of the chapters are random and are nowhere to be linked with each other.
So, in my personal opinion (I like plot events a lot) this season was weaker in that aspect. The season was strong in character development (New doctor, clara's relationship with Danny) but most of the events that happen have no real link whatsoever with a general plot and even some chapters (like those mentioned before, moon and forest) are really clumsy and make no sense at all.

The freaking forest chapter was like:

Hey a forest.

Wow the forest is bad.

We can't do anything.

Wow forest is good.

Yay.

But nothing really happened.

He played well against Arsenal, but I don't think there is any doubt he's not comfortable defensively as a midfielder. There was talk about getting Khedira during the last transfer window and people still want to pursue him for January. 

My question is what do we need to do to let Cesc to just attack more because our defense in the mid (and im saying this even from watching our less hard matches eg Leicester is not good unless Matic is doing something fantastic). 

It's a formation question and who gets put out: http://imgur.com/KAB7mcs our formation yesterday. what do we do if we want to sure up the midfield? Do we play Cesc hoping he improves or do we add another DM on the pitch at the same time. Do we give up the right wing? Something has to give if we have another defensive presence in midfield. **How do we do it. what formations? Whilst maintaining the attacking prowess we have with our current line ups**

My only guess http://lineupbuilder.com/?sk=58c0 

Another question is do we need changing? I accept there are lots of occasions that our midfield is poor in closing down, Can's goal yesterday is just one example. Do we just hope things get better or is there a problem that needs addressing in formation?

Earning £42k base (plus bonus would bring ~50), debt from student loan on payment plan one. This brings in 2436.93 per month. I live in London, no car. I have also got a Personal Development Loan paying £211 per month until October 2019.
I rent in London at a cost of £850, bills are £80-£100, travel costs are £110 for tube.

At present I have no emergency fund. I plan to save £5k in a CASH ISA as priority for this purpose. Once this is achieved I will place ~500 per month (or 20% of after tax income rising with Salary) into a S&amp;S ISA which I hold with iWEB. I’m planning to purchase into Mutual Funds 80% equity, 20% bond, passive index tracking.

Equity breakdown:
•25% UK Market
•	50% Developed Market
•	15% Emerging
•	10% REIT
Bond Breakdown
•	75% AA 0-5 year UK
•	25% Index linked UK

Aim of the portfolio is to provide retirement income for 65. I am looking to switch from iWEBs fixed £5 fee to Cavendish to reduce my fees given the lower fees for this instance, and the fact I’ll be paying into it monthly, and rebalance yearly.

I plan to rent for the next 5 years at least, and the begin looking at properties if necessary after this period. Whilst maintaining 20% of after tax salary into investments. At present this won’t be covering the £15k limit on an ISA, but will likely in the future.

How does this sound? Is there anything glaringly obvious that i'm missing?

Some things of note:

* Heat Map - Dislike Eriksen out wide, where he seems to be pushed too. Thought he was much more effective down the middle where he played last year.

* Rose and Naughton both provided good width but, as the heat map shows, no midfielder pinched in to support, possibly because how shit our possession was today.

* As for our distribution from the back, Kaboul only completed 2 long balls forward, with a shaky and slow Stoke back line this could have been something to exploited, but with some bad distribution paired with no clear target man, we wasted a ton of balls going forward.

Let's get something out of the way first - I've been doing them for the last two seasons, and here's what I've always thought:

* It's /r/coys, match threads should be personal, with detailed commentary about Spurs and what they're doing.
* There should be unbiased talk about how players are performing, about mistakes made, about great work done, about silly fouls conceded etc.
* Like it happened today - not cool to have all caps bold text asking a player / manager to fuck off - there has to be a line somewhere, and that shouldn't be done again - I agree.
* There should be a little bit of banter about the other teams and we should be able to make fun of the opposition players in the match thread commentary etc.

That's what my understanding has been, but some people disagree, and since this is being done *FOR* the community /r/coys, it should be done based on what everyone wants and not what I think or what someone else thinks.

This season was about a post-war Doctor rediscovering his role in the universe, and debating his own ideas over the situation he finds himself in. His desire to mask his guilt by playing hero to the human race (Drs 9, 10, and 11) caused him to slowly morph in to a guardian at all costs, and eventually (very nearly) a slave to his unconscious need to save everyone.

This Doctor is innately aware that this is not his role, but he awoke to this regeneration with a control freak companion and a million expectations that were now no longer part and parcel of his psyche. He had broken the need to make up for his sacrifice of his own people, and now he must find out who he really is in the face of these expectations. He awoke with a ton of weight gone, but with everyone around him telling him who he was and what his role is (to them). These statements did not jibe with who he felt he was, and the confusion led him to question everything about himself (""Am I a good man?"") and his companion(s). 

He defered decisions on important (Kill the Moon) matters to humankind, because he was aware that he must, and that he was not meant for the omniscient guardian role. 

He's an idiot in a box with a screwdriver. He has rediscovered what it means to be the Doctor and the series has reset and come full circle. Now Moffat, et al,  are free to play with a Doctor Who universe unencumbered by the necessity to constantly be making up for something. 

Perhaps, if I may go out on a limb a bit, this finale was heavy with accents of the 3rd Doctor because that series was all about the Doctor being teathered to Earth and taking the role of it's guardian (and waking up to that role because of the actions of his previous incarnation), and ends with his being freed to explore space/time again...and boy, did the 4th ever run with that bit!

If a manager is out of his depth, it's as simple as that. 

And for a side that collected 69 points last year with no sales and numerous additions, the team isnt as bad as people claim. We'll honestly gotten worse every game since QPR, and not only are they utter trash, Harry basically gifted us the game by experimenting with an awful 3 man backline that they have no understanding of and no business playing. People overestimate how bad we were last year (third highest point total in Premier League era, only three points off of the ""wonderful"" Bale season under AVB and more than the year with Bale, Modric and VDV) and underestimate how much worse we are this year. I hope Poch can turn this around, but it's time to stop acting like Poch is faultless here.

Ok so Roms played what 15 games this year so far and he's score 4 goals I believe. It's not the worst record but fuck me if it's not underwhelming. We paid nearly £30m for him in the summer and this is what we are getting. (That was almost certainly all of our remaining budget too because we did need strengthening elsewhere but just couldn't afford decent players.) He's so remarkably inconsistent where the only consistency he does have is consistently being bad. He has a shit work rate and his first touch is horrendous. His passing has improved but it's still bad. I seen a theory before and the more games he plays the more I think it's true. He was only good for us (and West Brom) because he had to impress Chelsea. He has no one to impress anymore so why should he bother? I mean he's going to be first choice no matter what, so why would he push himself to be the best. I'm not even that angry about that because honestly if I was in his position (not with Everton of course) I'd most certainly take in £70g every week for minimal work on the pitch. And yes we don't know what he does in training which except extra sessions with big Dunc which brings me to my next point. Can ye remember a season when Dunc scored 20+ goals? No? Me neither? So realistically how beneficial can this extra training be? 

Long story short, Rom needs to pull his finger out and start performing if he does actually love the club and if not well then if Martinez is happy shelling out £70g a week on him when he's not giving his all well then I can't fault Rom honestly.

People have been saying so much lately, and I agree, that our team doesn't look like a team. We don't move as a unit, everyone seems to be on different wavelengths, etc, etc. Essentially the players have no desire or belief because they don't know what they are trying to achieve. This is because we've had 4 different managers in almost 3 years. These players have all been brought in under different managers who have had different visions and play different systems, and THUS instability and a team that doesn't fit together. 

I'm sorry if this kinda offends people, but who's fault is that? He literally fired a manager after he finished 4th with us two years in a row. Yes you can say that Redknapp got distracted by the England job and all that, but really, the man makes a few mistakes, BUT still we finish 4th twice and he gets fired. WE FINISHED 4TH TWICE, but no, fired. Then with AVB, Levy doesn't let him bring in his own players and he ends up with sub-par players that he had to compromise to get. If we had just forked out an extra couple of million to buy Moutinho (a realistic replacement for Modric) AVB's system might have actually worked and we might have made Champion's League. We missed out by a point and that could have made the difference.


So then comes AVB's second season and, oh no, things haven't been going very well, for half a season, let's fire the manager, and get in none other, than Tim Sherwood - a man, who didn't even have his full coaching qualifications. I know people will say how bad we looked under AVB and what not, but clubs have ups and downs. Firing a manger every time your club has a 'down' is just going to breed instability and create a group of players that don't fit together. For this club to get back to tradition and actually play some nice and exciting football, Levy needs to stop obsessing over money and the 'Top Four'. Above all else we need to start looking like a TEAM, because Football is a TEAM game. If you don't play like a team, you'll keep getting beaten by Stoke and West Brom. Our players need to believe in what they are doing and get some fucking stability, and now that Levy has created this reputation for the club of firing the manager every time something goes wrong I just don't see how we will achieve that.


The difference between us and Stoke tonight was that Stoke actually wanted it and played as a team. I'm not denying that some our players are to blame, but Levy's trigger happy reputation is just feeding the mentality that it is every man for himself in this club, because by God, everyone knows that if you put one toe out of line, you're out.


I know I said I don't care if you downvote me in the title, but I actually do, but only because I want people to see this. Disagree with me if you must, but lets be mature. Don't downvote me to oblivion if you disagree because thats not how Reddit works. Downvotes are for people who post things that aren't relevant to the sub. If you disagree with me, post it in the comments. 



Edit: Two downvotes a minute after posting. I give up. Seriously.

2nd Edit: People have been saying that Levy has made us a much more successful club and I don't disagree with that. At no point did I say that he hasn't. I only said that post-Redknapp he has been pulling us back, but since when is it the Tottenham way to say ""We used to be worse so than this, so it's ok if we are declining, people are just being spoilt."" 

*It is better to fail aiming high than to succeed aiming low.*

Don't tell me that I shouldn't make a fuss about us steadily declining and playing worse and worse football.

I have loved every episode of Doctor Who since the 2005 reboot. Every silly, crazy, lovable episode. Until this season. This season has had more bs, more bad writing, more handwavium, plot holes, unimaginative stories, and straight up terrible ideas I have ever seen. That finale was absolutely horrible. What's worse is Moffat is ruining good characters. He just disintegrated the Master, re-exploded Amy and Rory, turned Brigadier into a Cyberman... I can't stand it. Doctor Who was my favorite thing, but madman Moffat ruined it this season and with that horrific cringe Santa ending I have no hope for the Xmas special. Clara sucks, Danny sucks, Moffat sucks.

We have a lot of average players IMO, players who would struggle to make any top 6 side in the Prem, we spent quite poorly the with Bale money out of the 7 I can honestly say only 2 have performed with any conviction and that is Eriksen and Chadli.

Lamela - I fail to see what Lamela brings to our squad ok he is leading the assists table this season but that's it, holds on to the ball to long, cares more about doing his step overs rolling his foot over the ball, behave and play a goddamn simple pass. 

Capoue - Again same as Lamela I can't see how he has improved us, no way he is the same standard as Sandro, even with Sandro's injuries. Failed to count how many times Capoue loses his man or doesn't track the runners, doesn't tackle anywhere near the amount Sandro did.

Chiriches - I actually liked him at first but now not so much, too complacent, takes too many risks and a lot of individual errors and decisions.

Soldado - I feel for Soldado on the basis we simply aren't playing football to suit his game, want him to succeed so bad, but at such a high price his goals simply haven't happened.

Paulinho - Again hasn't improved us one iota, too slow in his passing, his decision making, too weak in a tackle, simply not good enough.

If we are buying 7 brand new players surely at least 4 or 5 should have been from the Prem itself, those who are already equipped to play in it.

Rose - He did improve a tiny bit, but just an average left back for me. Too slow in his recovery, his decision making his poor a lot of the time, goes down too easy when the opposition hasn't even touched him.

Adebayor - Lack of movement, lack of determination, no desire to win the ball, weak in a tackle, poor finisher at times, in terms of hardly making the keeper work. Not a team player.

Kaboul - Not captain material, don't see him dish out rollicking's to his own players, poor decision maker, one of the biggest culprits for giving possesion away.

Townsend - Pretty much again same as Lamela cares more about doing his step overs than playing a simple pass, loses possession too many times, lazy in tracking back, poor decision maker. 

I could on but this will suffice for now.

A lot of parents say that, substitute disappointed. I would hear other parents say that to their children, and now I'm very grateful that my pops always said frustrated. Being angry at or with somebody, and being disappointed in them are very personal emotions. Frustration, on the other hand, has always felt much more benevolent. Frustration to me implies confusion, mostly inwardly focused, based on outward forces shaking what I think I know about a certain topic. 


Right now, I'm frustrated. I'm not angry, disappointed, or anything else. When I chose to support Spurs 5 years ago, I KNEW this would happen. Like many before and after me, I became familiar with club trends and stereotypes. ""Spurs are a cup side."" Bullshit. 



I'm frustrated, but the future is literally indefinite. Fucking Stoke, right? Poch is a solid manager, and I hope he sticks with us for a long time.

Could the T.W.O.D.I.S be and abbreviation for ""Things Without One Dimension In Space""? 

Both abbreviations reflect what the device is suppose to affect, rather than their purpose, or any actual name.

The reasoning behind my speculation is because a ""Space"" has 3 dimensions, length, breath, height, XYZ; A ""Plane"" is 2 dimensions, length, breath, XY; A ""Line"" has only 1 dimension.

So ""things"" that exist in ""space"" and is missing one dimension, is essentially ""flat"". therefore, that device is meant to manipulate ""Things Without One Dimension In Space"", restoring their third dimension.

First and foremost, figure out the striker debacle. At the very least one of Soldado or Adebayor needs to go. A, we can argue back and forth about the merits of each player but in the end they've both earned their trip out of North London. B, sends a clear message that no matter your wage or transfer fee you can and will get moved if your performance is lacking in form and spirit. C, frees up our lineup so young players (Kane/Chadli/Lamela/Eriksen as of now) can play more often together as a unit and thus grow together. I also think the team HAS TO sign an attacker in January. Berahino seems ideal, but whether or not attainable I don't know. Carvalho is an interesting name as well. I would like them to be precise with this move. I do not want to see a gamble on a player returning from injury i.e. Jay Rod. If we were in better form then the risk could be taken but with this team you need to add as close to a sure thing as you can. 
 

Second, the Spurs must solidify their central defense. Kaboul simply isn't playing at a Premier League level. I don't know if he's regressed or was simply overvalued. Fazio seems to be in over his head as well. I liked the ideabehind signing him as he is a big body, but his contributions have been red cards and turnovers in our own box. Vert hasn't been the prolific player we expect. I don't blame Poch for giving him a breather. Dier hasn't been used at his natural position too often so tough to judge but he isnt going anywhere. Have to find a player in January who can come in and not drive Lloris abosolutely batshit crazy. I know they have looked at Kramer the kid from Gladbach. Again, as with striker, I would like them to target a player who can step right in with the first team. Easier said then done. 

Third, the Spurs should make a conscious effort to sell multiple players on the current roster to change the club mentality, help the club financially for new needed transfers, and free up spots for new transfers or young/youth players. Paulinho, Townsend, Vlad, Soldado, Adebayor, Lennon, Kaboul, Capoue, and Dembele come to mind. This does not mean I think these players suck, it means I think these are the players who have not worked out here, aren't necessarily part of the future, and can gain a return. Let the young core Mason, Kane, Eriksen, Lamela grow together and augment them with transfers both in January and in August.

Last season was possibly the best team I can remember when the players were on form, I seriously thiunk luis suarez might be the best player who has ever played for the club, and obviously him leaving has a massive effect, but it doesn't explain the form of the team at the moment, he is still only one player. I think there seems to be a variety of problems, which rodgers doesn't seem to be handling.


**Goalkeeper**

Mignolet is a good goalkeeper generally, lets not forget that. His problem is that he doesn't seem to be a rodgers goalkeeper, oddly enough, pepe seemed like he would have been far better suited. Mignolet is a great shot stopper, but he isn't very commanding. I don't thing that's down to him on his own though, i think it's a communication breakdown which makes it seem like he's never sure when to come out, and i'll come to that. Worse than that for the system though, is that his distribution is atrocious. I'm sure many of you remember pepe claiming the ball in the area, and in seconds an extremely accurate throw or kick launched an attack straight away. I remember watching him warm up at anfield practicing his kicking to a trainer on the half way line, every kick was inch perfect. Nothing in this world is more infuriating than seeing the defenders play it between themselves until the opposition have formed their defensive lines. They begin to press, it goes back to mignolet and then his kicks go either out or to the opposition. There are three solutions to this, play it back less, buy a goalkeeper who is better with the ball at his feet, or mignolet trains to the point where his kicking is as accurate as pepe's. One of these options seems the most obvious, i'll leave it to you to decide which one.

**Defence**

This is a biggie, and many of you have your opinions on where we go wrong. I think there are a few major problems, the biggest of this i think is communication. Think of what you consider our best defensive performance this year. I think it's likely most of you would say the madrid game. The reason i think we were so much better defensively was kolo. Specifically, the communication between kolo and the rest of the defensive. The moment that summed it up to me was when he made that beautiful tackle on ronaldo by putting it over his own bar, then instantly turned to skrtel and congratulated him for the job they did on closing him down. Throughout the game he seemed to make sure the positioning of the players was right, congratulating them on what they did right and making sure mistakes aren't repeated. In turn, this gives mignolet confidence, both to come out and claim, and more generally that he will be under less pressure. Some of you think lovren is a bad defender, I disagree. I think he showed last season he is competent enough. I think he is not a good communicator and leader however, and his playing style is one wqhere he rushes out to meet attackers, trying to nip the ball away or pressure them into a mistake. Unfortunately these two things really don't go hand in hand. Many times this season have I seen lovren going for the same ball as skrtel/sakho. If neither claims the ball, as happens on many occassions, the opposition are through. I feel skrtel is equally as bad at this, however I don't think skrtel is a great defender. At some point he will cost the team penalties with his pulling in the area, his positioning never seems good to me. I think lovren/toure should be the CB pairing until sakho comes back, and hopefully sakho will be moulded in the similar vein as Kolo. The second point on defence is the obvious one. Well, I would have thought obvious, however it's been two years and nothing has changed. That's right, set-pieces. Whatever rodgers is telling them to do, I have no idea. Every time the opposition get a corner, I expect them to score. This seems down to a few reasons. First, the one I have mentioned, communication. Too many times are both CB's going for the ball and missing, the chelsea goal yesterday was a prime example of this, both lovren and skrtel went sprinting to win the ball at the corner, missed it, and from there you are in a very bad position. Combined with this was the fact that half the team rushed out to play offside whilst Gerrard and iirc johnson stayed in, henceforth the picture that was on the front of the subreddit yesterday. If they had moved out then the goal would have been offside. If you are not going to move out you have to win the second ball. Johnson missed it, the rest of the team jiust stood there and mignolet had no chance. These are not isolated incidents. I think we need someone else to take over the teaching of defensive duties for set-pieces, and i think the importance of communication needs to be instilled into the players.

**Midfield**

The biggest problem seems to be that with gerrard as DM, we are playing as if we still have suarez or sturridge up front. The beauty of that last year was that you had the choice of whether to work it up slowly, or just ping one over the top, knowing that sturridge or suarez would instantly be onto it. This appkied a lot more pressure to the opposition, simply the fact they had to be wary of the ball, because in seconds it was in the back of the net. We now don't have the pace, but gerrard still plays the balls. Last year it was worth kepping him there in spite of his defensive flaws, because he created enough that it wasn't worth it. The team also kept the ball for significant enough portions of the game so that gerrard wasn't tested as much defensively, not at the moment. The key is to use gerrard as an impact sub in a more advanced role, at least until sturridge comes back. This should not all be put on gerrard though. Henderson has been a shadow of himself recently, he seems to be playing more similarly to how he did for england, holding back. Henderson was so effective last year with our high press game. He consistently won the ball high up the pitch, distributed and made hmself available for the pass. Now I see him coming back deep alongside gerrard to collect passes, then seeing no one available he passes it back to the df, which goes to goalkeeper and so on. To get the best out of henderson we need a better dm who can press harder, so he doesn't feel the need to come back as often, and we need a hard-working creative player beside him. At the moment rodgers uses allen, who i am a fan of. However it really does not work having those 3 midfielders with no creative spark. The same with playing can in there instead. It worked last year because gerrard could find suarez or sturridge and it would stick, then the players were good enough to find the net. At the moment we see the ball passed between the midfielders to the defense, whilst the attacking players are wasted on the wings, hardly getting near the ball. I think there was a stat of the game against newcastle, where sterling only dribbled with te ball twice in the game. This is down to the fact we have no creative spark in the middle, so we can't work the ball up to the attacking players. The answer is simple, play lallana down the centre and give him a run in the side. Why rodgers has yet to do this i don't know. The second option is coutinho, but i think lallana the better player at the moment. One of the two is definitely needed though, and they have both proven themselves willing to track back and help defensively.

**Attack**
 
There has been a lot of criticism of the strikers lately, however i think this is the position at least fault. Balotelli and lambert both feel like second strikers to me, particularly lambert. Balotelli has the talent to play on his own though, so why no goals? I think an interesting point to consider, if mario balotelli played for chelsea instead of diego costa, would they be in the same position? I think so. They are both strong mobile strikers with a good touch and decent finish. Costa is obviously the better player, and would have scored more, however i think balotelli's problem are more to do with the lack of support. He really doesn't help his cause with some idiotic shots from ridiculous positions, however I think this can be taken as a sign of some frustration. Balotelli seems like another berbatov to me, he won't look bothered for most of the game, but will turn up and finish when given the ball. I think rodgers needs to know when to use him, and when to use the only fit quick striker we have in borini, instead of just planking balo up top endlessly. The other option of course is sterling up fronyt alongside lambo or balo, which rodgers hasn't yet tried. There are lots of games where pace up front would have been extremely effective and we have none.

**Conclusion**

There are many problems, some of which stem from losing suarez, some which were papered over due to him, such as the defensive frailities. All is not hopeless though, we have the players to fix it. Rodgers seems very stubborn to me in his refusal to both drastically change his first team, even if players have played well enough to break through, and to make changes before the 70 min mark. I still feel he is a good manager, but he must be willing to make the big changes. I currently feel our best team until sturridge gets back for home games at least, would be the team below reverting to borini as the striker with sterling and markovic/coutinho on the wing's when it's not the right game for balotelli. I also know most of you aren't fans of johnson, but I feel at the moment he is far better defensively than manquillo. This will probably change in the near future, but I don't think johnson is as bad as people are making out.

I've dealt with our lower to mid-table finishes of the 90's, getting pumped by Chelsea, Arsenal and United was the norm but pretty relative to the quality of the squad we had then. AND like everyone, remember the utter jubilation and enjoyment of playing the likes of the Milan's and Madrid in Europe more recently.... 
But, and i'm sure i'm not alone in my feelings here, i do see a talented group of players massively underachieving and with no attacking game plan. We arrive in opponents half's with players coming forward and persist to simply move the ball from left to right with no incisive passing or movement to trouble opponents defences. I really do believe teams find us quite easy to defend against because of this.   I would love to see Poch turn these sorry run of results around but i really don't see him doing this without implementing a number of key changes. Personally i like to see the following additions made to the squad as i truly believe only a couple of changes need to be made to really improve how we play. Please comment as i'd love to hear what everybody's thought are on here. 

1)	As the title says, more width please Poch! It drives me mad to see Lamela continue to bring the ball inside from the wing and try and play some miracle ball through the defence. This is really why he loses possession so frequently. Take the ball and RUN AT THE WING BACK!!! he has a bag full of tricks and some pace to his game and unlike Lennon who used to do this with half the talent, Lamela can put a ball in the box with his right foot but he refuses to do it. Now I watched him for Roma in Serie A and he used to terrify defenders when he ran at them but he doesn't do it for us. Now i don't know if this is a confidence thing or if he has been asked come inside but he needs to stop. He closes down so much space for whoever's playing 10 and you don't stretch the opponents defence  hence making it easy for the opponents defensive line to so squeeze up and close the space.
2)	Townsend on the left. For pretty much the same reasons as number 1. SPACE. When he’s played on the right he has to come inside because of his left foot. Now what a beautiful left foot he has, he bangs em in for England and has hits the odd beauty for us too but he’s so predictable for defenders as they know he has to come inside. On the left he needs to be attacking the opponents wingbacks with his pace and playing the ball as he can deliver too. And on the left, he can still have the odd pop at goal too. 
3)	Eriksen needs more support from deep. I can’t see how anyone in our squad should be playing 10 over him. I know he hasn’t had the greatest of seasons but what Spurs player has ? (Lloris doesn’t count, as he’s is the best keeper we have had over the years but he’s far too busy for my liking, buts that for another time.) This incessant need to play “2 holding midfielders” is crazy. When we have the ball we should be pushing players forward to support him in the middle and with Townsend and Lamela keeping their width, more space will open up for them to knock the ball around with. Now like most spurs fan I feel this should be Dembele’s job. A guy who seems to be very comfortable on the ball can play a lovely pass but doent have that mentality to go after the ball or seek it off other players. He’s clearly a gifted player but seems quite happy to go with the flow and not get in the box or commit himself overly. I see a lot of talent go to waste with him but if he ever decides to pull his socks up and really put a shift in for the team and push to get in that box and cause defenders trouble Eriksen’s game will improve too.  Another candidate for this role could be Mason. A player who i was initially concerned about when we started him but again like most have been won over with his fantastic mentality to get the ball and push spurs forward.
4)	You’re a striker! Get in the Fu@%ing  box.  We play a 4-2-3-1 formation the majority of the time. Now when you drop from having the usual 2 upfront you need your midfield to get with the striker and support him with either interplay or off the ball runs. Which we are guilty of not having done recently, which in turn probably draws our striker back to try and gain some possession (hence point 3). However the number of times you see midfielders looking to make that through ball or long ball and our striker is never there. Now  Soldado has been disappointing since signing but I do believe this to be a major factor in having struggled so far.

Anyway I could ramble on and bore you all forever  but I’d love to hear what you all have to say. Rant over

I've dealt with our lower to mid-table finishes of the 90's, getting pumped by Chelsea, Arsenal and United was the norm but pretty relative to the quality of the squad we had then. AND like everyone, remember the utter jubilation and enjoyment of playing the likes of the Milan's and Madrid in Europe more recently.... 

But, and i'm sure i'm not alone in my feelings here, i do see a talented group of players massively underachieving and with no attacking game plan. We arrive in opponents half's with players coming forward and persist to simply move the ball from left to right with no incisive passing or movement to trouble opponents defences. I really do believe teams find us quite easy to defend against because of this.   I would love to see Poch turn these sorry run of results around but i really don't see him doing this without implementing a number of key changes. Personally i like to see the following additions made to the squad as i truly believe only a couple of changes need to be made to really improve how we play. Please comment as i'd love to hear what everybody's thought are on here. 

1)	As the title says, more width please Poch! It drives me mad to see Lamela continue to bring the ball inside from the wing and try and play some miracle ball through the defence.

A little background:  I moved to the UK in August for a teaching job (from Canada).  My phone was stolen two weeks into the school year from my desk at the school I teach at.

Phone was stolen Mid September.
~2 hours after theft, it was reported stolen to the police.  I also called my provider and had the phone cancelled and blacklisted.

And then nothing... I didn't hear anything.  We scared the hell out of my students with police visits and empty threats, but no sign of my phone anywhere.  I replaced it the first week of October with a cheap android phone.

First week of November, a police officer shows up at my house and takes an official statement from me.  They've found my phone and confirmed it's mine by matching the IMEI numbers.

The person who stole it attempted to sell it at a game store (where you have to provide ID before selling something) so they have the person's information provided it was a valid ID.

They told me they couldn't reunite me with my phone until they'd determined how the person who tried to sell it came into possession of it.

**Why is it that they can't return my phone?
Any ideas on how long it might take to get it back?
When they take the person who tried to sell it into police custody, what will the next steps be for me?**",false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,null,null,self,My phone was stolen. Police have found it.

I'm looking for a folding bicycle for my ~20 minute / ~3 mile commute in central London. I'm probably heading home to Australia in the next year or two, so it doesn't have to last forever which is good because my budget is pretty tight - probably £300 max - so I'm not in the market for a Brompton, sadly.

I was very very close to purchasing this [Bickerton](http://www.evanscycles.com/products/bickerton/junction-1607-country-folding-bike-ec065992) for £400 but it didn't seem to be particularly quick to fold, and then I got cold feet about spending that much, so got back on Gumtree. 

I can see a few Apollo models for £90-150, and I've been to see a Tiger Foldaway for &lt;£100 (apparently ridden for about a fortnight only but still second hand, which I understand come with risks) but I can't find much about them online which makes me nervous.

I've included the link to an excel spreadsheet that I record my tupperdor contents. 

I did use an app, but it's small and inconvenient. I've put this in my dropbox so I can use it at home and work. 

Field names: 
* Producer  
* Cigar Name  
* Vitola [Drop Down List]  
* Length  
* Gauge [Drop Down List]  
* Quantity [Drop Down List]  
* Price  
* Date  
* Age  
* Rating  
* Buy More?  

When the quantity gets to zero, and the rating (1-10) is 7 or more, the buy more field will say 'BUY MORE'. The date field is dd/mm/yyyy - putting in a date will populate the age field, currently it only shows you the number of days it's been in the tupperdor.

In the beginning I was all in for Clara not killing Danny's emotions, as it seemed a lot like suicide attempt. But really, it was a great way to introduce a conversation about assisted dying.

He was in pain (that additionally might have been caused by his Cyberman body) and wanted to end his life (emotions here). He wasn't content with position that his body put him in and clearly his time to die had already come. Visibly aged face only draws more parallels to euthanasia, which is often discussed as possible outcome for elders. He couldn't do it himself though, which is again very similar to the position that people are sometimes in, being dependent on others to fulfill their final wish. Many people cannot, due to their moral compass, comply to that and decide to not act on that wish. The Doctor did just that, backed off, just like many medical professionals do in these situations. Decision ultimately lies on the loved ones and they might, or may not do it. It was a decision extremely hard on Clara, as it is in real life. 
The questions and conclusions we take from that could be very different. It can be argued that this case is a radical simplification, and Danny was clearly not in position to make that choice, due to clearly it being clearly new and traumatic on him. It only adds to the discussion on the line we draw between suicide and euthanasia, and the importance of regulations to separate the sick needing psychological help from these being in their full wits and truly willing to make that call in an unfortunate situation.

I'm a 20yo apprentice on apprentice minimum wage coming up to the 1 year mark meaning my wages should move up to minimum wage for my age. This was important (not just because it's my right) but because I'm leaving for maternity soon and it's my difference between maternity allowance and statutory maternity pay. 


So while I was speaking to HMRC's Pay and Work Rights Helpline I happened to mention that my wages are paid on the last Friday of the month but is the same amount every month as they have added up 52 weeks of pay and divided that by 12. I was informed that while that is common for salary pay, it's illegal when on minimum wage as it means in 5 week months I'm not paid enough for the amount of hours worked in that pay period and though they overpay me in 4 week months, they can't pay me less than minimum wage for the hours worked in a 5 week pay period and I was entitled to claim that money back.


I blew it off thinking it would only add up to less than a tenner and I was more worried about making sure my wages got moved up on the right date and I get my maternity pay but I've just done the math and it turns out I've been underpaid £286.41. 


£71.47 in January, May and August and £72 in October. (I don't know if I can do anything about January because it's last tax year)


Now I fully intend on contacting HMRC's Pay and Work Rights Helpline in the morning to confirm all of this and then contact my union for advice on what to do from here but what I'm asking you is:


Is it worth pursuing this at the risk of annoying my employer? I mean, it is my right to do so and right now, I need every penny I can get but do I want to ruffle feathers after already going out of my way to prove that yes they do have to pay me maternity when they said they didn't and yes they do have to pay me minimum wage for my age and not apprentice wage despite my apprenticeship course length being over 12 months and me therefore technically not having passed yet.

Let's face it, Death in Heaven was just so great that I was angry. I squealed, cried, and screamed at my tablet all throughout this episode, but two main things left me thinking. I know that Danny Pink was your classic: ‘Take me not him/her!’ hero, but, c’mon Danny, really? He sent back that child that he had killed while he was a soldier. I completely understand why he thought that this was a good idea, but he didn't think it though all the way. According to the Doctor Who wiki, Danny had served in the Army for 5 years. He killed the boy, and left the Army to become a teacher. So, the boy died 5 years ago. Don’t you think that the boy’s parents, would have heard about “Danny’s” Army coming into their country and killing civilians? The parents would have most likely though that their boy had died. There wouldn't really be any other explanation. If Clara followed through with Danny’s wishes at the end of ‘Death in Heaven’ and brought the boy back to his parents, they would have been skeptical. The boy, judging from his looks would have been at the age where he would have told his parents about being dead and returning. His parents, or at least, if I were his parents, I/they would have probably freaked out. Danny should have thought this through. Also, I know Danny is not the selfish type, that’s why he sent the boy back instead, but did he really think about Clara? She could have easily gone into a state of depression after he had given her the boy. She could have realized that there is something after death, so she commits suicide to be with Danny. That would be terrible of course, and we all know that Clara would never do that, and Steven Moffat would never write that into the show, but still… Bad decision Danny.

Secondly, what about Orson Pink from the episode ‘Listen’? He claimed that his great grandmother and grandfather had passed down that toy solider to him, when Clara had given it to Danny just a bit before. How is this going to play out? Check out this article from Metro, they talk about this too: http://metro.co.uk/2014/11/09/doctor-who-series-8-is-clara-oswald-pregnant-with-danny-pinks-baby-4940891/
	Anyway. I know this is just a television show, but it really makes me think. I've grown up with these characters, and I love the show so much that it is almost a reality for me. Sound off in the comments letting me know what you think! Let’s have a debate, shall we?

Michelle Gomez delivered an amazing performance, but this is just another episode in a long string that undoes the impact of previous episodes.

I almost cried at both of John Simm's ""deaths"" - his portrayal of The Master was so wrought with the pain of living hundreds of years as the pawn of a tyrant Time Lord. When he let himself die to torment The Doctor, and when he attacked Rassilon in End of Time, I felt the catharsis he must have been experiencing. He finally got to end it all, and with a sense of purpose. But now if I go watch those episodes again, the affect will be gone because I know he's just going to regenerate into Missy and have to keep on living his insane life.

The Master isn't the only thing they've done this with. The big obvious one would be the return of Gallifrey. There are definitely counter examples - Rose was stuck permanently in the other dimension, Donna permanently had her memories wiped, and Amy/Rory are inexplicably permanently dead although the plot holes surrounding that are gigantic. But it remains that this show's desire to keep certain elements around for a 50 year tv show has robbed many of its moments of all their emotional impact.

Edit: And even this episode! I don't trust it anymore because I don't know if Danny is really gone, if Osgood is really dead, and I KNOW Missy isn't really dead. Her last moments could have been just as serious as John Simm's - with her crying that she wants her friend back, then coldly accepting her fate as long as it means she gets proven right about The Doctor's soul.

Just wondering if someone more qualified to judge Spurs could tell me a little about the strange (imo) selections that Pochettino makes.

For one, why is Vertonghen not playing? I always felt he was the most talented defender of yours, seems strange to start players like Naughton and Fazio over him. Dier had a great start but has been dropped? Fairly?

Also is this Mason any good? He hasn't looked amazing from what I've seen (admittedly only MOTD highlights) yet he's keeping more established centre-mids out of the team.

The Doctor and the TARDIS, now more than ever, seem more ""exposed"" to the general populace than they have ever been before.  Remember a time when no one seemed to know who he was?  When he was more of a legend, or a myth?  Think back to the first episode of the new series, where Rose went to meet with that dude from the Internet, and they were both ridiculed as loonies.

Fast forward through several Christmas specials, where something bad seemingly happens to London every Christmas, and no one is surprised any more.  Then we get to this season, and it seems in almost every episode there are more and more people meeting The Doctor, stepping inside the TARDIS (sometimes with little to no reaction, dare I mention the Forest episode?), seeing all sorts of wonderful stuff and their reaction is like ""meh"".  [Then, in Death in Heaven](#s ""they make him Earth's president for crying out loud, with all of the world waiting on him!  Again he doesn't actually do anything!  At the end, the TARDIS dematerialises in the middle of a busy square, and no one bats an eye!  Perception filter?"")

I get it, more people know they're not alone in the universe, nothing is surprising any more... but I would like to kindly point out to production and writers than by doing this, they *strip away all the wonder and magic The Doctor expresses*.  The Doctor is a bit like a wizard, with an amazing blue box that travels in time and space.  People are *supposed* to be in awe of this.  If their reaction to meeting him, to stepping inside the TARDIS is commonplace and ""meh"", then what is this doing to the character? 

Compounding this, the writers this season gave Capaldi... what exactly to do?  What did he ACTUALLY DO this season?  Capaldi is an incredible actor, and he makes a perfect Doctor, but for the love of all that is holy, give him INCREDIBLE THINGS TO DO, and don't strip away the wonder and awe that The Doctor should rightfully exude!  

TL;DR: writers seem to be increasingly making The Doctor and the TARDIS more commonplace and ""meh"" with citizens of Earth, thus taking away all of the wonder and awe that a time-traveling alien with two hearts deserves.

Here are some details: I jumped on the bandwagon last year when my friend showed me the Fiftieth Anniversary Special. I had actually seen the first... two? three? I saw the first few episodes that aired in America waaaaay back in, gosh... 2006? I knew who the character was thanks to pop culture, but that was the first time I had seen the show at all, and while I liked it, I ended up losing track of it because I was busy. A few years later I caught some Tennant stuff and wasn't super impressed (in truth, this is not my favorite show at all: I am *just* interested enough to keep watching, plus my friends all watch it haha) and didn't go back until it showed up on Netflix and I watched the first series all the way through. Anyway, my buddy enticed me into watching the special last November because, according to him, it wrapped up the plotlines from the first season (that was a big part of why I didn't keep watching the Tennant stuff), so I got on board. Actually, what pushed me was that short about the Eighth Doctor! I had never seen the movie but that was really cool! After that, we watched the special and everything clicked. So he made me a playlist of essential episodes (thanks, Wunderlist!) and I caught up before completing the loop by watching the special again. Since then, I've bought Series Eight on Google Play and occasionally I get high and watch Classic episodes (it's a good as Star Trek!). So the reason I'm asking for a Master list (heh) is because I actually skipped all of the episodes about him in the current series. I decided that I should watch him the right way and start at the beginning. I put it off for way too long, but I would assume there are plenty of people here who are looking for a similar list right now.

I lived in the UK on student/post-study work visas from 2010-2013. My visa has since expired and I've returned to the USA to live and work. However my British boyfriend and I recently became engaged. We are uncertain in which country we want to settle permanently and are still weighing the pros and cons of each.

If, however, we do choose the UK, will my National Insurance number still be valid upon re-entering the country or do I have to reapply or reactivate it? My understanding is these are lifelong numbers (like a Social Security # in the US) but I'm not sure what happens once your visa expires and you leave the country. Similarly, would I have to re-register with the NHS and wait to receive a new NHS number? Do HM Revenue and the NHS even make a distinction between temporary residents and permanent ones when they distribute these numbers?

I realise these may be stupid questions, so please take pity on me. I'm used to the States' confusing and bureaucratic medical and tax systems and naturally expect benefit providers to fuck me over at every turn.

It's called the Kiripati Timeline:
""An explanation of Time Travel""

*Yes, every Whovian says it's a big ball of wibbly wobbly timey wimey stuff but,
go against the norm and think of it from a linear viewpoint. Time is a continuously happening straight line and
at every moment; the past..present and future is happening concurrently.
Case in point(even though a pathetic ending to the episode) - Robots of Sherwood:
Clara calls them, ""Robin and his merry men"" .. hence coining the term - but the only reason she knew of the term - was because it already existed in her present. Essentially, a paradox. Bootstrap; I believe.(I don't have time to evaluate and verify as my trainstop is momentarily). However from a Kiripati viewpoint, the paradox does not exist - because at every moment of time - every moment of past, present and future is happening simultaneously. The straight line that is time .. is always playing out.. every past, present and future. At this very moment in time.. your birth, death and you reading this .. is happening.
Hence the Sherwood, Pandorica and the events of, ""Listen"" are explained - not by paradox, but by Kiripati Timeline(KT).*

Hope you can help,

My bike wouldn't start this morning, I have lights but when I press the ignition there is nothing, you don't even hear the starter motor.

It was pretty cold out 1-2c but I've never had a problem getting it started in the morning and even if it has had a spluter you always here the starter at least trying first.

Not sure if it is related or because it is old but I had a problem getting it down into first and then getting out of neutral even after rolling the bike forwards and backwards.

Any ideas would be helpful, had to take the car today made me very late :(

cheers

Edit:

* Tried changing the fuses

* checked battery terminals and electrical connections I could get to.  

* Tried bump start and jump start - still nothing, no clicking from the starter relay.

Edit 2:

Got it fixed, got to the starter relay and found corrosion around one of the terminals, cleaned up the terminal and  the wire, started her up first time :-) thanks for everyone's help!!",false,MotoUK,t5_2wf1v,null,null,self,96 Yamaha Diversion XJ600S Won't start [x-post /r/fixxit],1,http://www.reddit.com/r/MotoUK/comments/2luhdm/96_yamaha_diversion_xj600s_wont_start_xpost/

**Southampton 2-0 Leicester**

We've only gone and done it again! 4 Consecutive clean sheets and victories, not bad at all. I went to watch the West Brom game on the opening home game of the season in August and the way Leicester set up reminded me of that an awful lot. Packed their box with what felt like a 10-0-0 formation with the sole intention of not conceding and getting a point from a 0-0. A few of their players were time-wasting even before the 30 minute mark! Almost looked like it was going to work too but Shane Long came straight off the bench and got painfully close to a hat-trick. Pelle had some gorgeous hold-up play for the first goal and after that we looked very much in control. You're probably all sick of the media saying ""They've had an easy fixture list, wait until the big boys visit"" but as we've been seeing, us and Chelsea are the only teams consistently beating mid-table and below so even if we do get a few losses against Arsenal, Man City etc, we're still in a great position. We March On!

I can't really complain with the other results from this weekend, it's certainly worked out for us!

[Liverpool 1-2 Chelsea:](http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/29860231) Fantastic result, I was a little nervous that Liverpool would somehow win this fixture as it's the sort of jammy thing you expect from them. Luckily Chelsea took all three points meaning our lead over our friends up north is now 11 points after 11 games. 

[Burnley 1-0 Hull:](http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/29860234) They've finally won a game! Hull are a strange one this season, they've looked pretty solid in every game I've seen but they just can't get any points. Burnley beating anyone is a good result!

[Man Utd 1-0 Crystal Palace:](http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/29860235) Probably the only result that didn't go our way, Crystal Palace were slightly unlucky not to get something from this game. 

[West Ham 0-0 Aston Villa:](http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/29860233) Really good for us that West Ham couldn't pick up all three points here although I am slightly worried about going away to Villa in a couple of weeks.

[QPR 2-2 Man City:](http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/29860232) Amazing result! Would've been slightly better if QPR had held on but opening our gap on third place to 4 points is unbelievable. 

[Sunderland 1-1 Everton:](http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/29868801) Everton have been dropping points all over the place lately, another handy result for us.

[West Brom 0-2 Newcastle:](http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/29868777) Bloody hell, Pardrew is doing wonders now, four wins on the bounce! I think it's got to the point where we want them to drop points!

[Swansea 2-1 Arsenal:](http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/29868805) Arsenal drop a lead once again! It's quite funny to have a look at the Arsenal subreddit where they mention we're just a flash in the pan for a easy fixture list. We won away to Swansea didn't we?

[Tottenham 1-2 Stoke:](http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/29868773) Oh dear, oh dear. What a shame we lost away to Spurs when everyone else is winning there! Poor old Poch.

Week in Numbers
---
---
* 3 - Number of shots on target against us in the past 5 Premier League games.

* 2 - Number of teams who have conceded less than us. (Bayern Munich and Juventus)

* 0 - Number of goals conceded via a defensive error. (Bayern Munich are the only other team in Europe to achieve this)

* 8 - Southampton have already won two more games than we did in 2004-05 (the last time they were relegated from the PL)

This coming week
---
---
We've made it to the International break! Since the last time our players left to play for their country, we've scored 15, conceded twice, taken 12 points from a maximum of 12 in the league, opened one of the best training academies in the world and booked our place in the League Cup quarter-finals for the first time in over a decade. Can't really complain can we?

* Can this be done by any decent garage or should I be going to a Suzuki specific dealer for the service?

* When I bought the bike, it didn't have a service log book, how do I get a new one so I can keep a decent record of everything for when I sell this bike?

For all of the excuses we can offer - Sturridge injured, Suarez leaving, players bedding in - you look at Southampton and realise how weak those excuses are.

Southampton got picked apart in the summer window - they lost a lot more players than us (most of them *to* us).  However, they invested their income wisely.  Have their players needed time to ""bed in""?  No.  Tadic and Pelle have been their stars.  Bertrand and Alderweireld have been part of a defence that *keeps* *clean* *sheets*.

I'm not one of the ""Rodgers out"" crew but I also do not think that last season makes him immune to criticism.  He played a ""weakened"" team against Real and they played well.  Suddenly, none of the players that play well are in the team for Chelsea, and we revert to the same team and formation that have led to us now being in the bottom half.  There is no logic, sometimes you have to hold your hands up as a manager and say ""I have got it wrong - I need to make a change"" - it doesn't feel like there is much chance of that happening.

We can hold on to the hope that Sturridge returning will improve things (and I am sure it will to an extent), but what happens when things start going wrong *with* Sturridge fit?  Do we keep playing the same way again?  You have to adapt to the circumstances that are out of your control and take advantage of the circumstances within your control.  Rodgers has done neither of those things yet this season.

Been talking to some people about what our strongest 11 is, and since Poch fancies changing around the formation and what players we use, I've had these thoughts for quite some time. 

Lloris 
Walker - Dier - Vert - Davies
Capoue - Mason 
Yedlin - Eriksen - Lamela 
Chadli 

Call me crazy, but it could just work.... Chadli is built like a brick house and can certainly play up top, and Yeds played a bit of right-mid during the WC and at times for the US and can deliver a good ball and will provide tons of width with him and Kyle, whoever happens to wind up going outside.

The flat is a top floor flat, in a fairly new build.  The attic for the building is outside our flat, in the common area (stairwell.)  

Now over the last two weeks we have been kept up by lots of scratching coming from above and now, in the walls, its some kind of roddent, I have laid out traps etc within the flat itself to confirm if we have any, and so far no bait has been taken and no traps triggered. There is no openings/holes within the flat so I can't see how any rodent would get into the flat (but I am aware they're crafty).
The scratching over the last week has gotten worse, being woken up at 2/3/5 consistently.  

Now we contacted our letting agent to ask them to help, it's not our attic, it's not listed on our rental agreement.  They simply said 'phone the council, it's your responsibility', I don't mind contacting the council but I am aware this isn't a council building so doing this will probably incur a charge, that I feel we shouldn't pay (it's not our attic) but I also know absolutely nothing regarding tenancy rights, we really want this sorted asap and I am close to giving in and paying (or crawling up there myself and laying poison) but after I have already paid for a boiler repair (which I shouldn't have) I'm feeling a little put out by this company, what are our rights? where do we stand here? can we force them into action at all?

We are 5 guys from Finland coming to Insomnia Gaming Festival and we are looking for a place to sleep. One of us is playing in the Dota 2 tournament but since he is underage, he needs a guardian with him. One guardian would've been enough but we decided to gather a bigger group and have a fun trip together.

If someone of you could recommend us a cheap place near the ricoh arena or even better, let us bunk in your place, it would be amazing. We are well-behaved and won't cause you any problems (i.e. we won't get wasted etc) One of us is 16 and others are 22-27. I know that 5 guys is a big group but we can without a problem sleep on floor on mattress or on sofa if there aren't enough beds for everyone
 
We will arrive on thursday 20. and leave on monday 24. morning. We would need a place to sleep for 3 nights(thu-sun) because we are planning to spend the last night in London. We are offering to pay 100€/79£/night.

Regards, zoge

Today, the boss demanded to know who had placed the fliers on the table, which everybody denied knowledge of (we work shifts, there are some guys I only see when Im coming to work for my first shift, or going home at the end of my last shift).

At at beginning of next year I'll be moving to the Netherlands for 2-3 years, and upon returning I plan on looking to buy a property after a short period of renting while I get things in order.

I have a few concerns regarding how lenders would view those few years living abroad when it comes to getting a mortgage. Currently I'm a self employed Web Developer, however I'll be aiming to get an office job while in the Netherlands. I also plan on getting out of the self employed status when I return home and opt for an office job.

Are there steps which I can take to help my credit rating in the UK while I'm abroad? For now, I plan on having my address switched back to my parents' home for electoral purposes. I'll be contacting HMRC about paying NI while I'm away, and I plan on picking up a credit card and setting up one or two direct debits (although I'm not sure which credit card to go for) and paying it off at the end of the month.

My question is, are there any other steps which I could be taking to help my credit rating while I'm away, and in particular, are there any steps or precautions which I could be taking to help securing a mortgage simpler in that time?

Between my partner and I, we plan on coming home with around £20-30k in savings. I currently live in (and would be returning to) the Glasgow area and hope to mortgage a house for upto 150k. My partner has no debts, and the only debt that I have is a student loan.

For one thing - is the Master/Mistress God/gods now? Did s/he float the idea of an afterlife to primitive man to snare their souls for her diabolical plan for thousands of years? Wouldn't there have been billions of cybermen (who didn't all need to burn themselves up to stop the clouds).

Another thing - with the right technology you could conceivably bring anyone back or at least communicate with them. Imagine chatting with Napoleon or Julius Caesar? History would be re-written.

Why exactly would the bodies and souls be connected? Unless that was just part of the Master's plan to have more bodies to convert to Cybermen. What would happen to all those whose bodies just rotted into nothing over the centuries?

How did the Nethersphere get the soldier from the Dalek story in the future? By that time it was conceivably shut down (?).

How would religious people react to this thing? They might think it was keeping them from reaching the true heaven. Would atheists be cool with a technological afterlife? What about suicides? Knowing they will be uploaded into this thing would they go ahead? Or murder - if there is a possibility of contact with the people inside you could use their testimony in court ala Rashamon.

That's the problem I've noticed with the new series is they bring up some interesting ideas but these ideas are often so huge that they would change humanity significantly; however, often it's just back to the normal more or less as the series moves on.

* Squishy cyber suits.
* The cybermen can fly, and airforce infinity is the most defensible position they could think of? Where's the UK's version of Norad? And where's the fighter escort?
* Cy-Danny saves Clara and takes her to... a graveyard?
* President of the Earth, first order of business is interrogating the bad guy. I would think the president could send someone to do that. I know he's not going to take the job seriously, but seriously.
* Let's do our work on the bad guy's tech in the same room as the bad guy, and not even behind bars.
* Osgood got an invite to be a new companion before she's been inside the TARDIS? She's dead.
* British guards, even when they don't have a stupid furry hat on they can't move even when something is happening.
* Scottish accent in a windstorm. Can anyone understand what's being said. Belgum? It's not French? What?
* ""Permission to SQUEEE!"" Okay, they get to take a sin off for that one.
* You need an uplinked and friendly cyberman to answer your questions? Why's it have to be Danny? There's a whole bunch of harmless baby cybermen wandering around.
* Holy crap, Missy's performance. This scene. She's funny, she's terrifying, she's pleading, she's angry. Amazing. And the Doctor's response. This is why all the sins don't count. This scene. Wow. But, there's a few more sins to count.
* Someone forgot Cyber-Danny's sunken eye makeup at the end.
* Nice speech Danny, but I'm not sure your Cybermen were listening. They're brain dead.
* Cy-Brig is still around? How many other dead are around? They're never going to revisit it, are they?

Two thoughts:  First, the Master custom-designed these particular cybermen and I conjecture that those killed by their beams are auto-uploaded to the Nethersphere.  

Second, we know that the consciousnesses are still being uploaded because Danny wound up there again, after his heroic suicide.  Though the Nethersphere is technically collapsing, it is still around for long enough for, say, a Master to run over to her office and grab an identical bracelet to what Danny used and return to the real world before the Nethersphere collapses.  

I believe Missy was counting on losing, or at least completely prepared for the possibility of death.  Perhaps even that while the Doctor would not kill her, he keeps around people who will, and that's part of the psychological war she's running against him.  Everything she does is a trap, and more thought out than we're probably giving her credit for.  I think she may have seen some usefulness in Osgood as a companion, and nipped that in the bud.

While it'll be mostly work, we will have extra time during (we're done by 1500 each day) and two extra days after. We are staying in the Earl's Court area. I'm trying to research/look for things to do, sights to see, 'real' UK to experience, and just general suggestions, tips, ideas. 

Also, with the two days off, the girlfriend really wants to see Paris (a bucket list item?). From what I've gathered, we might just want to make that a quick day trip? Is there anywhere else on the way there or back that we could stop? And the second open day, I'm not sure yet. Maybe a trip to Stratford...  

Anyway, below is what I have gathered so far (it is just paraphrased from earlier replies). Any other ideas? 


I posted here a few days ago https://www.reddit.com/r/AskUK/comments/2llym5/help_american_first_time_visiting_london_for_work/


So far this is what I have (from others):

•	Train tickets, apparently we can buy them the day of, but if we buy ahead from here it’ll be less expensive. Although we might want a ‘RailPass’ that covers lots of options.  

•	Bath is a really cool historical town, we should go there. But we should take the train (and skip Stonehenge) directly to Bath. visit bath website 

•	Alternative would be a bus tour to see both Stonehenge and Bath. 

•	Take a riverboat down to Greenwich, walk up the hill in Greenwich Park to the Old Royal Observatory, and stand on the meridian line. Maybe also see the Planetarium show while we’re there. 

•	Make time to go see the Natural History Museum (it’s worth seeing for the building alone) also, in the same area there is Kensington Gardens and Albert Hall (We can get Albert Hall schedule &amp; tickets here )

•	Maybe go see the Royal Naval College, it’s a pretty cool historical building. 

•	Theatre tickets, on night of? We can head to the Leicester Square Ticket Booth in the afternoon and watch something that same day/night.

•	The Tower of London, we haven’t seen it, we should. Especially because we can see the Poppys Art Exhibit (marking 100 years since WW1) while we are there http://poppies.hrp.org.uk/ 

•	British Museum… definitely

•	Head to Birmingham and check out the German Christmas market maybe. Not too far by train, and the market is right in the center of the city. Lots of stuff, shops, Christmas lights, etc. Maybe also see the Staffordshire Hoard  at BMAG (museum and art gallery). 

•	Evenings while we’re in London? Museums and other London ‘sights’, and head to covent garden and go to a pub for a real UK experience… 

•	Warwick Castle! Can also see Stratford and Avon (Shakespeare) at the same time. Scenic. 1.5 hour train ride from London to Warwick, .5 hour more to Stratford. We could also stay overnight and see a play by the Royal Shakesphere Company at the RST (very romantic, wintery weather, Christmas lights). We can buy tickets day of and come back whenever we want. Train tickets – easiest way would be to arrive at Marylebone 30 min be for we want to leave and just speak with someone in the ticket office. Another option is to book online (just less flexibility) http://www.chilternrailways.co.uk/    but if we do want to watch a play there, then we should book early as they might be sold out day of.

I earn £32k so am just on the cusp of paying 40% tax, however at the moment I nominate to pay 5% to my pension (employer pays 10%) and I also pay 5% into my company's shares scheme (they have just taken a hit but thats another discussion...) so I'm really being taxed on £28,800. I am about to turn 26. I have always been told to put as much in your pension as you can, my basic is 3% but my employer will match the extra 2% taking it from 8% to 10%. 

If it is an option, would the £125~/m or so I pay to my pension be better put somewhere else? As the share price has just been hit this could potentially be £250 put back in to my pay (after being taxed). 

I have about £2k in an ISA, so have plenty of allowance left this year.

How is this possible? Well, U-Verse has ""alternate"" sports channels that on the weekend show every EPL match.

So if you have U-Verse and the match isn't on NBC or NBCSN, check these channels before you try to get a shitty stream. 

The only problem with this is that there's nothing in the guide that says which game is on which channel, it only posts the information at the scheduled match time.

I'm MA from a Finnish university, where I studied History, International Politics and Education. My grades were quite good if that's important to you. 

I've been working since the mature age of 14, starting in cleaning, continuing to call centers and customer services/technical support for the duration of my studies and a bit more. I learnt hard working, problem-solving skills, how to communicate with angry people and working under pressure.

After graduating I got my first ""serious"" job in a smallish embassy in Helsinki, first in the Consular section and after a while I was promoted to PA to the Ambassador. While I was there I also had a project of being a translator/content writer for a company which is specialized in Orthodontics. 

However, after 2½ years I wanted to move away from Finland, so I ended up in Brussels. Here I have been working in the Permanent Representation of Finland to the EU, first as an archivist and now as an assistant to External Relations sector. I like this job because every day is different and I get to work with really interesting people, but I know how to do it already and cannot get any further in this office so it's time to move on. Now I would like to move to an English-speaking country.

What I can do:

- events (I LOVE events, the bigger the better)
- project management
- diary management 
- coordination
- general administration
- I'm familiar with diplomacy and EU
- I can write all kinds of things ranging from Verbal notes to Facebook updates
- research
- IT wise I'm good with Office (Word, Excel, Outlook, PowerPoint) and Windows, can manage quite well with iOS, I've done some very silly html in the 1990's, and I've used about 20 different databases.

I speak Finnish as a mother tongue and English fluently. I'm on an intermediate level with my French, Italian and Swedish and I studied Mandarin Chinese for about a year.

Why you want me?

I'm really nice. I'm usually on a cheery mood and have a positive view of life. People generally like me and find me easily approachable.
I'm a fast and efficient worker, a problem-solving orientated multitasker. 
I love to learn new things. I'm also interested in most things.
I don't reddit much at work. 

What I'm looking for?

Ideally, a project management or an event management role in international environment with good opportunities to build a career. Some of these aspects are negotiable, but at least one of them has to apply. 

PM me for my email address, CV, more details or anything.

Some people have written in other posts offhandedly that they think Clara may be pregnant.  I believe it; maybe it's part of or all of what she was going to say.

The nascent robots in Deep Breath are a new life form, aspiring to become humans.

Mini-Clara in Into the Dalek, literally there is a ""Little Clara""

Meeting her own descendant who looks just like Pink in Listen- he is certainly a descendant of Danny, and Danny's now dead, so unless he already has a child, he's going to need one.  (And he doesn't seem like a guy who would have a child and not be invested in that kid's life, even if the mother and he were not together)

The moon egg in Kill the Moon... Pretty blatantly about a new life forming.

After the WILD mood swing in Dark Water, the Doctor scans her and notes that she's a swarm of chemicals.  We're led to believe that this is just because she's angry, but what if it's because she's pregnant?

Once by myself and then again when my family was able to watch. Doing so, I kept noticing more and more problems with the episodes when I watched them the second time. I then decided to just wait till my family was read to watch the episode.

Now that the season has ended and we have to wait for the Christmas special, I want to rewatch the season. I just can't really pick any episodes I liked this season to rewatch.  Also I dred the possibility of finding more problems by rewatching any of the episodes from this season.

I bought £85 of cinema tickets for the wrong date.

I just lost £85 because of some ridiculous rule.

It wasn't even my fault! The 'session timed out' so I hit the back button, and it must have skipped back to the page whereby I was checking seating reservations.

Just something I thought I'd share. Massive issue if you ask me and it should be changed. Anybody had experience with this before?

Seems ridiculous.

:(

So now I've got to try and sell them or *maybe* get lucky and have them transferred to another showing or something.

Worth noting that I've spent over 15,000 odeon points in there over the past 3 years.

Despite good GCSE's, I messed up my A-Levels age 18 due to alcohol abuse issues and never went to University.

This year's April I finished 4 year stint as a community care worker for the elderly (2 years on the community, 2 years as the solitary night warden of a 48 resident sheltered accommodation) - It was a bad job, not for what it was, but because of how the agency treated me and the pay (minimum wage, even for a 10hr night shift of a 48 resident accommodation). Throughout those 4 years I was treated like shit by the care agency in question (pay missing extremely frequently, scapegoated for the care coordinators poor communication etc). I sunk further and further into despair by the day, convinced I was a failure.

I left that job and volunteered for the Department for Work and Pensions for 2 months (originally just a 1 month placement), and I impressed them a lot. When that was up I floated for about 3 weeks and landed a job as an Apprentice Digital Media Content Officer for a research institute at a Redbrick University.

This job is unlike anything I have ever dreamed before, and I've started to consider my potential, because In the two month's I've been here I've proven I have an instinct (not my words) for marketing and web content management/development. I have also had the opportunity to showcase my technical ability with regard to IT and HTML. Something I have never been able to express. Yet now, Work I have done, and sites I have contributed to are now live, and representing a University.

It's like I'm treated like a human being here, and it's a lovely place to work. They even gave me a brand new HTC One completely out the blue. With the calls etc all paid for until I leave. 

Do you think I can forge a career all the way to the top with this, or will I hit a glass ceiling at some point due to my lack of degree? I am extremely ambitious, and I want to do the best job I can. I just don't want to set the bar too high in my head.

He was first named Lord President of Gallifrey in the 4th Doctor series, The Invasion of Time. He only assumed office for that series and then fled again to do what he always does. He was appointed again as the Fifth Doctor in The Five Doctors and was no more keen to assume the role then and immediately left. In the Sixth Doctor finale, the Trial of a Timelord, he objected to being subjected to such a hearing and was informed that he had since been deposed.

In the Series 8 finale, Death in Heaven, when he was appointed as President of Earth I immediately recalled this and of Moffat's love for both red herrings and foreshadowing. So it could be nothing, but with the next series clearly about finding Gallifrey, there might be a storyline in there about the Doctor assuming the leadership role of Lord President once again. If Rassilon is out of the picture at the end of the Time War then that would leave a massive power vacuum. After all, we don't know what happened in the moments after the Master, Rassilon and Gallifrey were sent back into the Time War. All we know is that Gallifrey continued to fight the Daleks and someone else assumed leadership during the Day of the Doctor. 

What we do know is that the Master escaped the Time War. Here's a theory to chew on: What if the Master was sent to find the Doctor and bring him back to Gallifrey to save them from their own madness and corruption? What if the Master wasn't lying about the coordinates, that is where the Doctor will find Gallifrey, and that it's just a test to figure out if the Doctor can do it?",false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,null,null,self,"A parallel in between 4th, 5th and 12th Doctors and a new theory for Series 9 [Series 8 Finale Spoilers]",16,http://www.reddit.com/r/doctorwho/comments/2lwtuo/a_parallel_in_between_4th_5th_and_12th_doctors/

Especially when you add another inverted winger to the mix in Chadli. People constantly complain that Poch is starting all 3 of Chadli, Lamela, and Eriksen on the pitch but that's because Eriksen and Lamela, and increasingly Chadli, are undroppable. 

You guys might say that nobody should be undroppable and its all based on form, but that's simply not the case. Incredibly expensive players must be played, it is demanded by the board who bought him and also by the fans. Lamela's price tag demands that he be on the pitch a majority of the time, whether or not that is right doesn't matter right now. Furthermore, Eriksen was our best player last fall, and our only fucking true CAM now that Sig and Holtby are gone, and Chadli is our leading scorer. 

What does Poch do? Part of the problem is that we don't have any good out and out wingers. Lennon is past it and Townsend.. well, it's Townsend lads. Still, I think that playing Lennon on the right instead of Lamela is the best option. Lamela and Eriksen have proven they are incapable of playing together and the experiment of them playing together in this current formation/system won't last for long.

TLDR - Eriksen and Lamela don't work together, especially with another inverted winger in Chadli. Drop Lamela and play Lennon.

* When she wanted to talk about the contract, working hours and pay, the owner would find an excuse to 'wait until tomorrow'. This happened for over a week, yet she was always asked to come back to work another shift.

* All of the employees are from eastern europe, and all are paid cash in hand. Many are paid less than £30 per shift.

Anyways, I am really missing the UK. It has been my home for the last three years and I'm not sure what to do now, but all I know is that I need to be back home.

However, I am having problems getting back due to all the changes to the visas and work permits. I would love to be able to work in the UK, I mean I have a bachelors degree from the country. It makes more sense than other going to other places. I don't really don't want to move back to America because I have been gone for so long--I just feel really disconnected from other people in the States and struggle when I'm back home. My identity has really been created while I'm in the UK and I feel lost not being there. I'm originally from Minnesota and when ever I go back people usually ask me where i'm from because my accent has even changed (not completely, but I used more British words). 

I know this sounds like a whiny post, but I just don't know where else to go. 

Does anyone have any suggestions to how I can move back to the UK? I would really do anything, work, internship, anything. I have a degree in English Literature.

(To those who gave their lives to England during the 

Battle of Britain and left such a shining example to us 

who follow, these lines are dedicated.)

They that have climbed the white mists of the morning;

They that have soared, before the world's awake,

To herald up their foeman to them, scorning

The thin dawn's rest their weary folk might take;

Some that have left other mouths to tell the story

Of high, blue battle, quite young limbs that bled,

How they had thundered up the clouds to glory,

Or fallen to an English field stained red.

Because my faltering feet would fail I find them

Laughing beside me, steadying the hand

That seeks their deadly courage –

Yet behind them

The cold light dies in that once brilliant Land ....

Do these, who help the quickened pulse run slowly,

Whose stern, remembered image cools the brow,

I used to be indifferent to them, but over the last few years in Birmingham Muslims have gotten very aggressive.

I have friends who have been called ""black devils"" by Muslims In the town centre. I have had Muslims in town telling me how to dress, shouting abuse

In Birmingham every day they play their f'n prayer music throughout the centre.   I do not want to hear that crap. sorry for the outburst. 

the hijab or whatever is a big middle finger to western culture, when I see them put young girls in it I feel sick, stifling the expression of British youth. 

I wish they would integrate better. I feel so bad because I have always been a leftie.

I do realise it is not all Muslims, but it is the culture I hate not the people. 
Islam is just oppressive, aggressive and barbaric. 
sorry, why do I feel this way?



Edit: 

I made this post late at night so I may not have articulated myself properly, I will seek to do so in this edit. If you have any questions feel free to post them.

About the left: I always felt the left was about liberalism so I always aligned myself with that ideology but I find it hard to be tolerant of intolerance.

About my inner conflict: I do not want to leave the EU due to the economic benefits (free trade zone) so I cannot vote ukip/conservative. I do not agree with the BNP so I will not vote for them. So I am stuck.

About Muslims: I do think the Muslim culture grates against current British/western values and it causes a tension. I do realise it is not all Muslims so I am opposed to the ideology of the one that is shoved in my face, not the people or the more moderate ideas. 

About face coverings: I am opposed to the Niquab and burka not the hijab. It is unfriendly and shows you have no interest in integrating. 

About me being black: This is something that's not talked about but many black British (usually from Caribbean roots) are joining the edl/bf because of issues I mention. This will bolster those groups and give them more validity. The ethnic makeup of the right is changing. There are also Sikhs joining.

If you have any questions I will answer them.

*By Janan Ganesh in the FT*

The Bank of England has stress-tested the British financial sector and plans to declare its findings next month. Under controlled conditions, it subjected banks to a property crash and other simulated shocks to gauge their resilience.

For a political leader, speculation about their position is a kind of stress test. It almost always comes to nought but the adversity serves to illuminate the leader’s hidden reserves. It is an audit of their pluck and prowess. The foiled coups against Gordon Brown’s premiership between 2008 and 2010 revealed, for all his flaws, a tenacious politician encircled by vigilant advisers who were serious about power.

The Bank of Miliband is flunking its stress test. There were dignified ways for the Labour party leader Ed Miliband to greet whispers of a putsch against him last week. He might have ignored them, or dismissed them out of hand, or made a brutal example of a few malcontents pour encourager les autres. The Conservatives’ probable loss of a parliamentary by-election on November 20, in Rochester in southern England, would by itself relieve the strain on the opposition leader anyway.

Instead, Labour resorted to paranoia and a siege mentality more becoming of a millenarian cult than a grown-up political party. They blame the “rightwing press”, particularly the chunk of it owned by Rupert Murdoch, not only for the leadership tremors but for Mr Miliband’s low reputation in the country. If voters disdain Mr Miliband, the party seems to believe, it is because they are brainwashed. The best that can be said for this theory is that it has ideological pedigree; the one morsel of Marxist doctrine still evidently cherished by the British left is false consciousness.

Labour’s view of the press has soured to the point of self-harm. The Sun is read by more than 5m Britons every day, many of whom vote Labour or entertain the prospect of doing so. Yet the party talks of the Murdoch-owned tabloid as a remote Other. It is just about conceivable that Labour can win power while ignoring anyone who disagrees with it. How it expects to govern a plural nation with such a sectarian cast of mind is harder to understand.

Unhinged by indignation, Labour MPs even joined a hashtag campaign on Twitter to insist that “We back Ed”, like Brezhnev-era Kremlin officials denying rumours of a coup. To repeat: a major political party decided that having to affirm support for its own leader six months before a general election would somehow leave him an enhanced figure.

Instead of swaggering into government, this is a party curling up in a ball and sucking its thumb

Then there is the sheer pathos of Neil Kinnock, a twice-defeated Labour leader, stirring from his semi-retirement to stick up for Mr Miliband and mutter about those invidious newspapers again. This is not a party swaggering into government. It is a party curling up in a ball and sucking its thumb. Labour’s hysterical over-sensitivity has dramatised what should have been a little local difficulty. And if this is how it responds to a minor rumpus, it will not withstand the stringent trials to come.

In the new year, the election will really get going. The Tories, passive in recent weeks, will commence formal hostilities. Their campaign operation is unrecognisable from the shapeless farce of five years ago. Lynton Crosby, the Australian strategist, is manning the Gatling gun that will be turned on Mr Miliband.

Voters, too, will go into decision-making mode. Business will have its influential say. The government has two more opportunities – the autumn fiscal statement and the budget – to impose itself on events. And the press coverage that strikes Labour as unduly exacting now will only intensify. The party’s disarray of late, including the sad spectacle of frontbenchers having to ask journalists what they know of the rumoured coup, suggests it is not ready for any of this.

A long period in power diminishes a party’s memory of what it is like to fight an election from opposition. Labour last did this in 1997, and even that contest was won before it began. Neither Mr Miliband nor his shadow chancellor, Ed Balls, was there when a brittle Mr Kinnock fell to pieces under scrutiny in 1992. Some of the shadow cabinet were at school. They only sketchily understand what the Tories know from hard experience: an election puts the burden of proof on the challengers.

An opposition party can get around this by showing poise and solidity in everything from its policies to its comportment. Flapping around because of a largely imaginary manoeuvre against the leader only invites voters to wonder what the party would be like in a national crisis. Nothing about Labour’s behaviour over the past week augurs well.

255 British servicemen killed in the Falklands War.

And many other lost in other conflicts throughout the 20th century, and throughout history.

We were relatively lucky; many more of our relations fought in the various conflicts of the last century. They all came back alive.

Today, I continue the memory of my relatives a little bit further through the river of history, and speak their name in remembrance. 

I find the Sunday Service to be particularly incredible. During the two minutes silence, the royal family, the political leaders, past political leaders, representatives from many religions, commonwealth high commissioners, military leaders, Governmental officers, war veterans, amongst others, stand outside the Cenotaph at Whitehall. 

Afterwards, thousands of representatives from any and every organization, whether military or civilian, whether at home or abroad, march past the memorial. Thousands of ex and current servicemen and women stand at the memorial, and thousands of people crowd the streets to watch this parade. 

The Sunday Parade is the joint-longest running live televised event, and the 1947 recording is the oldest surviving recording of a live event. It was the second ever live televised event. 

After the 2 minute silence at 11 o'clock, the Parade takes on more of a celebratory role, as the thousands of people march past. The pile of poppies at the Cenotaph grows and grows, until the memorial is a single island surrounded by a sea of red.

There are three parts to this...

1/ What time will they turn up (if at all) ?  
2/ Will they fix the fault ?   
3/ Will my connection be as good as it was before they broke it a couple of weeks ago?

(Background - BT did some exchange work a fortnight ago, now I can't use the internet most of the time and its only on intermittently.  A secondary fault means I have massive packet loss if it does connect) speed is mainly too slow to load speedchecker.net.  The down time also seems to correspond with when it rains and there are 2 DP's open to the elements on my local poles)  

The closest answer will be bathed in internet glory for the day!

Edit - the answers are:    
1/ Yes - they turned up at 11.30     
2/ Sort of.  We now have a 0.01 speed on a 0.5 line.    
3/ No - its in an order of magnitude worse than it was before.    
(although this might just be down to really bad traffic shaping at BT's end at the exchange)

Anyway I'm just wondering what the process is of actually getting fibre installed in my house as I'm a bit clueless, will I have to pay to get it installed and would I have to go with BT or could I stay with Sky and change from ADSL or even switch to Virgin?

I wanted to get your opinion on my new venture: http://www.boxcit.com/ 

WHAT IS BOXCIT?

BOXCIT is a simple idea with one goal - to send you a box of your favourite things from some of the most iconic cities around the UK. We launched with our hometown - Liverpool. 

HOW DOES IT WORK?

You select 5 items from Liverpool to make up your box. We then package and post your box for free to anywhere in the UK.  It makes a great gift for a former Liverpudlian!

WHY LIVERPOOL?

Liverpool is an incredible place that has many things that are unique. Liverpudlians know exactly what they are. And those that left the area miss Liverpool dearly. Liverpool boxes only include things that are iconic to this great city.

What would you suggest for new additions to the box? http://www.boxcit.com/inthebox/

Orders are starting to come in as Christmas Shopping season hots up!

Now young Willie McBride I can't help but wonder why

Do all those who lie here know why they died

And did they believe when they answered the cause

Did they really believe that this war would end wars

Well the sorrow, the suffering, the glory, the pain

The killing and dying was all done in vain

For young Willie McBride it all happened again

And again, and again, and again, and again.

I'm studying to be a journalist at the moment and I can say with conviction that these newspapers are made for profit before actually telling the news. While this, of course, rings true for all newspapers (of course the objective is to be profitable), the tabloids print whatever they want because they know that there are too many stupid people who will throw their money at the paper as soon as they see headline or a minor headline saying ""UNITED IN SHOCK €50 MILLION JANUARY MOVE FOR RIBERY"". Of course, a 'rumour' like this is essentially not a rumour but rather a story that they have fabricated completely. They have every right to do this. 

Wait til January and keep an eye on the tabloids, see how many times they're right about their transfer rumours, and then of the ones that are right, see how many of them you can find printed or published by a more reputable source earlier than they published it themselves. I.e. they also pluck their more reputable information from more reputable sources. 

Just said I'd post this because I know that a lot of the fans on the sub aren't just from GB or Ireland and so, the sources might mean nothing to them while the story could still be one that excites them!",false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,null,null,self,Regarding rumours in tabloid newspapers,29,http://www.reddit.com/r/LiverpoolFC/comments/2lynpg/regarding_rumours_in_tabloid_newspapers/

Did my CBT in September, had a few half day lessons, and one full day lesson yesterday.

Yesterday's lesson was awful, nothing went right, so bad that practising u turns I ended up crossing the line at almost 90° !

Today everything clicked, must have done over 30 u turns before leaving for the test centre, all went well.  Rode to test centre, started ok, parked up in the bay for manual handling on the right so it was easier to reverse backwards and round.

Halfway into the turn I realised I'd put the steering lock on, and thought id fucked it on the first manouver, but because I'd realised what I'd done and corrected it it didn't matter !

The English folk don't really have a special thing to celebrate our national day St. Georges day. This upsets me. 


To fix this issue, I have appointed the 23rd of April (St Georges day), the day for the Throne. 


Basically, wherever you are, whatever you're doing, you have to go to the toilet (The Throne) at a specific time (TBC) and sit on the toilet for either, a set period of time or for as long as possible. 


This could be our little way to protest the lack of events planned for our national day. 


We shall call it...The Throne of St George...or whatever else sounds good. 


Anyway, today is the day I'm putting forward my idea and would like some feedback as to how to make this happen.

Today while stood at the till in a cafe, the waitress came to inform all waiting to be served that the 2 minute silence would start shortly so if we could just excuse her for a moment while she went to join her collegues - fair enough. A minute or 2 later a member of staff came over the tannoy (it was a cafe in a supermarket) and announced that the 2 minute silence was starting and to please respect this, as the whole of the cafe stopped in it's tracks and silence ensued I was looking around thinking how eerie this seemed, all of us stood as statues staring into space and not a sound to fill the air, no chatter, no cutlery clanking - nothing. I started to feel quite proud of how we do this, of the respect we have for our men who fought for us when the young guy in front of me (around 25yo) started tutting and sighing, shuffling and checking the time on his old Nokia. It just made me think ""All these people in still silence have 2 minutes to think about our history, I wonder how many off them are working out their bills, their laundry, their whole schedule for the day?""

Since then, I've received a bill from the Wales Trunking Authority for £2000 and I definitely haven't got that money to hand! I contaced the relevant people and asked if it was at all possible if I could pay it off in monthly installments and the person from the WTA refused. When I then said there was no other way for me to pay as I had cancelled my insurance with my previous insurer, they said they'd have to contact the Welsh government and call me back. Right now my nerves are all over the place because I'm terrified they'll take me to court and I'll have an even worse mark on my record than if I just put a claim in with my insurer. Can anyone with some experience shed some light on what could happen please?

EDIT: Turns out the Welsh Government has stopped any method of monthly payments in situations like this (which seems like a bit of a scam).

For example, at Southhampton, the deepest midfielder was asked to drop in and form a 3 man backline while the CBs would be asked to push the attacker wide and use the touchline as assistance. In contrast, with Dawson and King/Jan, we played stopper/cover with Jan pressing the man on the ball and Dawson watching behind. What do we do defensively now? I haven't seen either. Also,  at the start of the season, much like with Southhampton, I saw in the CMs move wider to cover the maruding wingbacks when Bentaleb was playing (not so much Capoue) but since he's been dropped I havent seen it? Do we have a structure or are we just winging it at the moment?

I translated only the Spurs related parts of the interview, but I can translate the rest of the interview which is mostly Swansea related if anyone if interested. I translated very directly, and if anything seems convoluted it's because it's a direct translation of a direct transcript of a spoken interview.

PS make sure to watch the Belgium - Iceland friendly tomorrow for a chance to see Siggy up against Verts, Dembele, Chadli and the likes! COYS!

It was great fun of course, it was really fun to get to play in the derbies against Chelsea and Arsenal and of course Europa as well as getting to play alongside a lot of great players. But I'm not much of a better player than I was at Tottenham. Everyone knows that I'm not as effective playing on the wings as I am in the centre. I think that's the only difference between how I was playing at Tottenham and how I'm playing now with Swansea.

Been laid off recently so I'm making some changes to the CV. The 'hobbies and interests' section needs a total rework as things have changed a fair bit. I volunteer a lot of my time and effort to the church which doesn't leave much time for other things. It doesn't seem right to just leave it out and imply I do nothing. I certainly don't want to lie.

I'm in my early twenties, looking for low-end IT work. Gotta be honest here, I think we can agree that IT work attracts a certain type - a type that is more drawn to atheism than the general population. Not in a neckbeardy sort of way, but a more 'practical' type that wont include the supernatural into their view of the world. 

I'm not worried about being dismissed because I am a Christian. But rather, I am worried about dismissed because I am different in a way people aren't comfortable with. I suppose I can compensate by mentioning 'normal' things I do but I'm not sure.

My main goal is to reach the interview stage. I'm comfortable in that environment and convey things that I can't do with words. Whenever my old company was looking at potential recruits they were always keen on getting somebody that had 'a life' outside of work. Doesn't sound professional, I know, but it was a small office and we wanted interesting people.",false,TheRedLion,t5_2vrbs,null,null,self,Hinting at my Christian faith in my CV - a bad move?,2,http://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedLion/comments/2lzcp0/hinting_at_my_christian_faith_in_my_cv_a_bad_move/

Please criticise and call me out on anything you see, I'd like this to be a fun discussion rather than a lecture by a clueless fan with too much time on his hands.

**Monk**  

I'm very happy. The transfers made during the summer were done early, we held on to the key players, shipped out the dead weight. He's not afraid to bring the younger players into the team with the likes of Fulton, Richards and Barrow getting games. He also looks to have improved his substitutions, no longer am I worried like I was when Taylor came on against Napoli. When the subs enter the game it looks like there is a tactical reason and a switch from what was previously happening.

**Players**

Fabianski has been excellent. It is very reassuring to know that he will come and claim balls in the air, something that other teams exploited last season with Vorm. Tremmel also looked great in the FA Cup until the final minute against Liverpool. I wouldn't worry if he needed to come on.

In defence Williams have been a rock, and we don't rely on him to make the big blocks as much anymore. Amat looked good, but is very guilty of holding players during corners, much like Shawcross. Fernandez has entered the team well, and I only think he will improve as he plays more with us and in the Premier league. Bartley also played well against Arsenal. Only mistake I remember is losing Mert during a corner, but made a great block against Wilshere in the final second of the game and won some big defensive headers. There is a lot more organisation between our back line which is evident by our 5 clean sheets this season. 

Rangel has been a great player for the club, and he's not getting forward as much this season, but I think that is maybe a good move due to not having the pace. It may be time that Jazz is slowly introduced as the season progresses. The same issue exists on the left with Taylor, where we need strong competition for his position. Tiendalli looked much better in preseason than he did last season, but I wouldn't rely on him in a starting role. Taylor has definitely got better into the season too. The first few games he looked very shaky, but he is being beaten far less in the more recent games. He also managed to push higher up the field against Arsenal, something we saw Davies do often, he can deliver a hell of a ball when given the chance.

Ki and Shelvey have looked good in CDM, Ki especially. He looks very relaxed and reassured in possession. Jonjo needs to cut down on some of the yellow card offences. Kicking the ball away against Everton was just idiotic. Carroll has come in and held his own. He provides the safe pass and working with Britton will be great for his development. He tries to be over adventurous at times, if he keeps it simple it will work well for him. Montero is a good impact sub, but I'm worried about his delivery and that he can be very one dimensional. Dyer and Routledge looked threatening during the earlier games and their runs helped the team while Bony was searching for his first goal. It's great that we no longer rely on our striker for all our goals like we did with Bony and Michu in the last two seasons. Barrow is potential, he didn't look too out of place this weekend. Will be exciting to see how he develops.

Sigurdsson is love, Sigurdsson is life. I was thinking about it the other day, but other than Emnes's goal against Everton in the League Cup, I don't remember a goal he was not in some way influential in. Either scoring, assisting or the through ball for the assist. Fantastic player. 

Up top Bony's hold up play is invaluable and its great he's finally getting on the score sheet. The more he plays the less likely his wasteful shots from distance appear to happen which is also great to see. He's using the ball much more too, but I guess Siggy is very helpful with that. Their link up play at times looks telepathic. Gomis also looks okay. He couldn't offer much during his start against Chelsea, but impressed on his debut against United and a few other sub appearances. My worry is that we will expect him to play like Bony, while I see Gomis as a last man striker rather than one who will drop deep to hold up the ball. I think both he and Bony could play together in the future against lesser teams, but it would require more of a 4-4-1-1 situation with Bony as the CF/#10. Would be a real handful for any defence. Emnes was a good purchase; He can make a difference in games and stretches the opponent. He was god damn awful when he came on against Newcastle though.


**League Cup**

It sucked, but there was a great win against Everton. I don't really blame Tremmel for the Liverpool result, it was unfortunate, but its a lesson he will know for next time. It was nice to see our strength in depth and using a different tactical game plan against Liverpool.

**League Position**

Again, very happy. 5th but level on points with 4th. The losses sucked, and there is a horrible consistency where if we concede right before half time to enter the changing rooms with a draw, we won't win the game. Saying that, every game we've lead going into the second half we've won which is a nice stat. We're keeping clean sheets and showed great resilience holding onto some of the draws especially after going down to 10 men.


**Those Above Us**

If we look at the teams ahead of us, other than the big names, their continuing progress looks incredibly unlikely. 

We'll ignore **Chelsea**. While they are the team to beat, have depth in numbers, and quality in abundance; They are letting in far more goals than they should. I can't help but think that they will also find a way to fuck it up for themselves.

**Southampton** appear to be doing well this year, but upon a closer look the teams they have played it shouldn't be so surprising. Last year they finished 8th in the league, and so far this season they have only played 2 of the teams that finished above them. They lost both of those games, against Liverpool and a under-performing Spurs. They did however win against both Stoke and Newcastle who finished in the top half last season, grinding out a 1-0 win against Stoke and it's difficult to commend their 4-0 win against a crisis-ridden Newcastle. They only managed to beat us 1-0, and that was after we lost Bony to a red card in the 40th minute and we held them to a draw until they scored in the final 10 minutes. The end of November kicks off a tough stretch for them and it will be the make or break. They play Man City, Arsenal and United back to back soon, after that their next 7 games include Everton, Chelsea, and both Arsenal and United again. I would suggest that they would be out of the top 5 as we enter the new year.

**Manchester City** are a shadow of the team they were last season, and have managed to scrape by due to the brilliance of Aguero and Silva. They have only managed to keep three clean sheets so far this season, against their cross town rivals United, Newcastle who I previously mentioned, and a underscoring Villa. Silva's injury is a big blow, Yaya has not been the same player since his cake debacle, and if Aguero picks up an injury it could mean big problems for City going forward. I think we can go into our next game against them and get a point at least.

**West Ham** are the one to look out for. They have been lucky that so far this season they have been evenly matched up with their fixtures, playing an equal number of teams from both ends of the table. Although the difference is that while they were only beaten trice by top 8 teams, they have pulled out big wins against Liverpool and Manchester City. I feel that they will be more likely to pick up the points in their up and coming games than Southampton, but again it will be telling if they can manage to stay in European contention.

**Why break it down like this?** I think its important to note that 7 of our 11 games so far this season have been against teams who finished in the top half of the table last season. For me this is a huge indication that we also deserve the plaudits that West Ham and Southampton are currently receiving, and further more that our current position is sustainable.

I know this Reddit account is new - I will link to my previous Reddit account if requested. 


As for the monitor, I'm looking for at least 1080p 60Hz.

Would prefer to meet up IRL to cut shipping costs - I live in North East England.

I was wondering if you guys could point me in the right direction as to my best chance of getting my hands on 2 tickets? I've been on all the football ticket selling sites that come up from a Google search, but I have no idea if they are legit, and they seem very vague with seating locations which puts me off. (Behind the goal etc.)

As said, I'm in London that weekend anyway, so what are the chances of getting a ticket outside the ground on the day? Or is there any sites that season ticket holders can sell their ticket for just one game when they can't make it?

I've got a few rubbish pairs which are either all to thin or not actually waterproof, eventhough they originally claimed to be. 
Does anyone have any insight or experience in the type of glove I need for this fast approaching winter? They've got to be FULLY waterproof, thermal, have decent armour on the palms and not cost the world (i.e. under £50). 
eBay just chucks up tons of cheap nasty ones which I'm generally becoming more dubious of due to past experiences.

Several sources have said we're scouting out central midfielders in foreign leagues as replacement.

Thoughts, feelings, speculation? I hope he stays but we'll survive as we do if he leaves. And I'm sure he'd fetch a good £30 million or so in the process.

If anything his videos satirized ""lad culture"" not promoted it. It feels like many of the people condemning him are the ones that lead to his success in the first place. Just remember, he started off on Vine; a social media platform. If he was truly as unpopular as the media are portraying him to be, how has he gained so much prevalence in the first place? I don't want to suggest that this is just political correctness gone mad, because in certain instances it isnt. Dont get me wrong, his videos that depict and make jokes of sexual violence are completely wrong. But the mainstream media very conveniently only chooses to use these videos when portraying him. It just feels like he is getting extremely harsh treatment for something that is mostly light hearted fun.
