So I made a ""Hopeful"" prediction for myself to keep interested, but please correct me if I've missed any contradicting facts
I started thinking about the Doctors core personality. It's changed when it's not supposed to (I think it was called ""the ultimate time lord"" which aired right before this season that made this exact point). 
Anyways, if it has changed, whats changing it? So I started thinking about the doctors confusion. I'd say way more confused than clever. Almost like the TARDIS was when she was in human form. and then that led me wonder about how the TARDIS is now for some reason extremely precise and controllable.
So my prediction is that the TARDIS is linked up uncontrollably inside the Doctors head. Which would also explain the ""souls"" or memories(?) in the heaven type place (the people the doctor couldn't save). Maybe they are in some TARDIS created dimension, kind of like the library girl.

I thought we deserved three points, I thought it was about time for us to get three points and I really thought all three points was ours, until Jagielka does that amazing strike to shatter our dreams.

I was fuming.

Today, once I've calmed down from it all and watched a few more highlights with a clear head, I realised the performance we gave last night (all speaking from Australian Time Zone) was quite positive, it showed what we could expect for the future.

A few players to note:

**Lallana** - For all the Southampton fans telling us he couldn't play for 90minutes straight, the man played for 210 minutes + penalties over the course of 4 days. Remembering he didn't have any pre-season either, he was the only guy that was still pressing hard 91 minutes into the everton game. I think today we saw what he could be and once he get a bit more match fit and a bit more confident, I think he will be invaluable for us.

**Super Mario** - Last night, initially I was angry towards him, because he didn't score, simple as that. However after watching the highlights when I was calm, I realised he was actually working pretty hard to win some of important balls back. He does walk along the pitch sometimes, but I think that's his smarts, he pick his battles and when he does go for it, he normally wins the ball. Another great thing about Mario is his confidence in himself. He will take a shot from anywhere and hopefully soon enough, they will go into the back of the net. Thats something Suarez brought to the table where even when a goal didn't seem possible, he will take a shot and make it happen. On the other hand though, Mario has been bought as a striker, so he needs to finish some of his chances.

**Gerrard** - He bailed us out last night when just couldn't find the net. What he also brings to the table is the other team still sees him important enough to dedicate one or two players on him all the time, which provides a bit more room for other players in the midfield. 

Overall, I don't think I any of our players did bad last night. **Moreno** may still be a bit raw in handling big strikers but he did redeem himself by making some great runs on the wing. Furthermore, I think the one last positive we can take from the game was, the goal we conceded, didn't come from a normal defensive error, (Ok fine the clearance could've been better), but more credit need to be given to the strike. 

I believe once Sturridge comes back, Mario finds the net a few more times, lallana get 100% match fit, this should be a very exciting team to watch.

No we will not win the league this season with the performances we've been giving, but definitely not far fetched to stay in the top 4.

**Positives:**

* The second half saw real fight from QPR.
* Charlie Austin has scored 2 PL goals in 2 consecutive games.
* Kranjkar has been very impressive in 2 consecutive games - I think he should take all free-kicks that offer a shot at goal.
* Ultimately QPR were beaten by a wonder goal, that few teams could have defended against.
* We played away, against a 2nd placed Southampton, the best team we've met so far this season, and only lost 2-1.


**Negatives**

* We have serious defensive weaknesses.
* Ferdinand looks to be guaranteed a first team start, no mater what.
* Onuoha and Suk-Young will be asking questions about their QPR futures.
* The 4 teams around us have games in hand - We need to start winning games, or soon enough, other teams will start breaking away from us.
* There still looks to be an issue with team cohesion on the pitch, 6 games into the season and after 7 summer training games, there's no excuse for that.

My app allows people to submit their own notes and read others’ for chilled out learning and revision.

So, to win £50, all you have to do is submit a note which you think is cool or useful, and become the top rated note (At the moment the top rated note has one like… Not much competition). Since there are only 3 installations of the app (it is new), you have perhaps the highest chance of winning this competition as you will ever have in your life! So, don’t give yourself cause for regret later, take a few seconds to download the app and submit a note… You’re practically guaranteed to win!

I'm in a bit of an awful pickle and I wanted to get as many second(educated) opinions as possible. 

I am a post graduate student from the US, studying in Scotland. I wound up having to move in to a private student hall because my other option bailed and I needed something last minute, have a tenancy agreement for a year. I am paying an absolutely ridiculous amount of money to live in a cheap tiny studio apartment(960 pounds per month, about). I stupidly paid for most of the year in advance. I was prepared to live with that. I arrived and have seen that every corner that could possibly be cut, has been cut. (""drawers"" in the pictures are actually fake, ""furnished"" means a bed and a plastic chair, no drawers or cabinets or anything in the bathroom, one drawer with dirt in it in the kitchen, to name a few things). No one showed me how anything worked in the flat, intercom doesn't do anything as far as I can tell.

I moved in and I notified my building manager the day after, on the 6th, of my problems with the flat and to please look into them. These were the total lack of privacy because everything, without exaggeration, can be heard from outside of my flat, and it is very very loud and I can't sleep because of how poorly sealed everything is. Large gap under the door as well in which you can see in my whole flat if you wanted to. 

They said they would look into it.

On the 22nd, I wrote an email expressing that none of these things had been taken care of and to let me know when they would be fixed as studies were starting and I couldn't get any sleep, focus or have any privacy. I also mentioned that the exclusive lounge that was only for people on my floor(we pay a premium for it) was not exclusive as it was advertised, because everyone else had access to it through the stairwell and took advantage of this. Also that the laundry room didn't work(no one showed us how to set up that ridiculous system either and I wound up paying nine pounds for one wash of laundry).

The next time I saw her she responded to my email and told me that some one was looking into the issues with the door(whatever that means) and she mentioned nothing else. She also told me that the laundry room did work and that I was doing it wrong(the system is an absolute nightmare and misleading).

From then on every time I came in or out of the building I got dirty looks.

On the 26th, she sort-of confronted me(the same and only building manager) and asked me how it was going. Not a friendly but an apprehensive way. I told her that ""this flat is not working out"" at all because I have been here for almost a month and not a single one of my serious issues has been looked at after asking them to be fixed and mentioning them to her several times.(this excludes minor things like a piece of my shower falling off).  She then aggressively and rudely denied that these were issues, said that the gap under my door was not big while laughing in my face(I can see what kind of shoes you have under the door). Didn't have anything substantial to say about anything really and dismissively scoffed at my problems in a flat I am playing 960 per month to be in. She tried to convince me that I couldn't prove that people in the lounge didn't live on the floor, which is besides the fact because anyone entering the building has access to it. In response, she said that she couldn't put a lock on the stairwell door because its a fire escape. Which I then said, ""then why does the website say it is exclusive when it is not? And if you knew you couldn't put a lock on the door, then you knew it was not exclusive. I told her that was false advertising. She had nothing to say.

She hotly told me that all I could do was find some one else to take over my lease of a year, which is unacceptable. SHe also told me that she was going on holiday this weekend and next week, as if saying ""I don't care about this or you and you won't be here to bother me on my holiday"". I did not want to immediately escalate the tense situation by saying I wanted to be refunded so the conversation ended there.

I have now started recording how loud it is in my room with a recorder.

My neighbors are almost all very young and also from another country(I am older and 24).
I feel like I am being taken advantage of as a student and as a foreigner. I feel this company thinks we don't know what to expect in this country in terms of fair prices and don't know much about living away from parents, that we are easily intimidated and so on. 
This has been generally a horrible and uncomfortable experience, I feel I deserve a refund and a breaking of my contract for obvious reasons(this building was not ready to be lived in when I moved here, false advertising, unwillingness to handle or recognize serious concerns whatsoever since the 7th, totally disorganized and unprofessional attitude and business, and absolutely absurdly high rent, especially for the garbage I am getting). I have spoken to student welfare and they are going to help me(I hope) but I have a few days to wait for them to respond because of the weekend and bank holiday.

They are taboo subjects and it seems impossible to find a rational conversation about either.  The closest we get to it is laughing at the pricks on the Nolan show.  Unionists and Republicans all seem a little extreme and the Liberals seem to have a real 'everyone is a cunt but me' attitude.  It's alot to take in.

With this in mind, has anyone had any real help from our Mental Health system?  Why is it not a top priority for government?  It seems impossible to get a diagnosis around here and I know too many people who are in dire need of getting the right help.

You do something for someone and they give you some item (gold, seashell, signed piece of paper, etc.) that society agrees gives you the right to call in that favor owed to you, but the cool thing is it doesn't even have to be from the person you did the original favor for.

The way Bitcoin works is instead of actually passing around gold or pieces of paper to record who did what for whom, a globally synchronized accounting ledger records this data in a cryptographically secure way. Since no tokens have to be physically transported, it is global and fast. But since no central authority controls it, it cannot be politically messed with, inflated, confiscated remotely, etc.

It's like gold that weighs nothing, that you can carry in your brain without anyone knowing, and that you can teleport anywhere in the world for a tiny fee or even no fee. You can do this with a few cents or a few million dollars just the same way.

my situation
I turned 21 this year so as a present me and my family went out of the country for 2 week i gave them notice before going away as the hoilday was allready book before starting universal credit and clearly state it is unlikely i am unable to do job search because i wont have internet/access to facitilties to help me find work.i filled in the letter they gave me when i returned back into the country yet they said did not received it  however when i got the letter saying i was being sanction the orginal copy was there meaning they have MUST have got it.ALSo they tried to contact me but i was in a course set up for me by my work programe and NO attempt was made to leave a number so i could contact them

my rough draft of the letter-just exampling my points
19/8/14 sent the letter on X/X/14 before the date of 23/x/2013 when I got the letter saying I was being sanction the original copy was attached to it this mean you have MUST have received it.
Reason-being out of the country and not having reasonable access to the internet or any other means to look for work is a good reason
Out the country and no internet or a reasonable mean and I would have no method to transport myself to a interview/ other help activities
22/9 I was taking part in a class set up by my work program and I was unable to react or response to the phone call there was NO attempt at to leave a number or any other mean to get back in touch
2. Finding work 
In the 2 weeks in question my adviser or my work programme did not tell me of any vacancies 
Nor was any job interviews was offered to me a
And no offer of paid work
Therefore I fullfil this part of my CC
Attend job interview/work immediately 

Having my payment stop will SERVERLY effect my ability to travel to interview and also limit the range I can apply for job seen as without transport  i can not travel far within the 90 minutes travel time agreed in my claimant commitment this meaning It is unnecessarily harder to gain employment
3. Action getting into work
It state in my CC I would normally spend 35 hours looking and preparing for work however being away is a abnormal circumstance. I did everything which was expected for me to do which was tell them was ample time that for the 2 week in question my circumstance has changed and planed accordingly this is in term with  changes in my circumstance due it effecting my claim. Also it states in my cc provide evidence that I have done work search or activates when required I range notifying you that I was unable to do this meaning it was not required of me to do this seen as I gave notice on why I was unable to do it

I'm a recruiter from an agency that specialises in Facilities Management recruitment (both hard and soft services). I thought I would start by posting a rather unique role that I have. 

I'm currently working with a very prestigious organisation who are looking for a chauffeur to join a pool of drivers (currently 4 others) who provide services to the organisations senior staff. The hours will work around a standard of 35 hours a week 5 days a week, however it won't be a traditional 9-5 role and individuals will have to be flexible to suit the needs of the organisations. If for example there is a formal evening event you may be required to work from 3 in the afternoon to 11 in the evening. You will work on a Rota basis so from time to time weekend work may be required, this would of course mean time off in the week. 

The role will also incorporate an element of close protection security duties as you will be providing a service for high profile individuals.  Primarily this will involve liaising with the security personal and providing cover and extra resources as and when required. The role is predominantly a driving role, but individuals do need to maintain a high level of security awareness at all times. 

Previous experience in a similar chauffeur/ CP role working with high profile individuals would of course be a massively beneficial factor, however the role could be ideal for an individual who is just leaving the army and has professional driving experience. The organisation are being quite open about previous experience as it is a rather unique role and are happy to provide training. 


Candidate requirements:

* Hold a clean driving license.
* A recognised advance driving and first aid qualification would be advantageous, however training may be provided.
* Strong interpersonal skills to interact confidently with Executive Team members and external counter-parties, acting with discretion at all times.
* Excellent organisational and time management skills with the ability to prioritise when required.
* Close Protection qualification or proven track record in this line of work would be advantageous (training can be provided).
*Ability to dynamically assess their working environment and react accordingly.
*Be able to travel within the UK and internationally, sometimes at short notice.

The role is paying £27,000 per anum on the basic salary, however overtime and other allowances are paid. Any travel that requires staying away from home would of course be covered. Other core benefits include a full career average salary pension (very competitive), private health insurance, 25 days holiday, season ticket travel loans. They also offer other flexible benefits such as additional days holiday, and extension of private healthcare to family members.

last Thursday my broadband stopped working, which I was told was 'a fault in the area', Friday I realised I wasn't getting incoming calls on the landline either so called support again and was told my account had been disconnected in June or I was paying someone other then bt... then told it was a fault in the area.

Friday afternoon I rang again as I'd found the landline number **has totally changed to a completely different number** - apparently no-one at BT noticed I wasn't calling from the right number number before (and even argued when I said that was the problem). eventually they've agreed there was a issue saying they'd send an engineer 'next week's with mumblings about 'oct 1st'...

to say this is the worst possible time is understatement - my dad passed away on Thursday evening and with no phoneline and no broadband I'm struggling to work everything out. (I'm also on bt vision so can't even flop in front of the TV easily as half the guide info needs the internet!)

if anyone knows a good number to call to get someone who actually knows something ,or what I can demand they do to get this fixed I'd be very grateful (I've tried Googling but its harder on a phone and I'm already way over my contract this month..)",false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,null,null,self,Anyone know how to get BT to fix a randomly changed number?,9,http://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/2hp32x/anyone_know_how_to_get_bt_to_fix_a_randomly/

Newcastle may be looking to buy him back for £8 million, how would you guys think if that went through?

The article also suggests that Reid is now cropping up on Man U's radar, but I mean, at this moment in time, he seems to be interesting all the big clubs.

I'm sure you all remember the white Goalkeeper kit Courtois wore in the game against Schalke (link:http://bit.ly/Yw7Ogh if you don't.)

Well, I was wondering if anyone knew anything more about it - why he wore it and not the normal red kit, or even the yellow kit which is our official away GK kit, also whether it will be available for purchase by the public.

So, for those who missed it, in the 1980s, Jeff Wayne got a rock-band together with a symphony orchestra and produces a musical score that follows H. G. Wells' *War of the Worlds*. It follows the Journalist, who narrates his story as Martians invade Earth, and wage war on us humans.

My Mum said it scared the tits off her as a kid, and recently he re-did the entire score with more modern musical aparatus, so I figured I'd link the new version. It's long, but the story and music is worth every second.

Yay! But then I got sent a 'pre-tenancy form' and am worried about what to do next. I got my first pay cheque this month, having been working part-time last year and travelling/in education until now. My last place I rented was a licence agreement, not a rental, or else I was living with my Dad.

I have been asked for a selection of things including


* three months of bank statements (I was on JSA for a month and I've seen loads of landlords or agencies here say they won't accept DSS so this is worrying, also was living on my overdraft this month while commuting and earning my first pay cheque...)
* previous landlord details for a reference (like i said, it was a licence agreement done through university)
* my last three pay slips (i only have one I was handed literally on Friday)


The agency want the deposit plus almost £300 in 'admin'. The guy I will be moving in with says he's never had a problem with them so they clearly aren't that dodgy. I just don't want to pay £300 and then be told they won't be letting me take on the tenancy because I'm a risk! I have the deposit and am doing well at work, so it's not like I am actually a risk really, but I can just picture them refusing but taking the admin fee which will impact my ability to pay for a deposit elsewhere.

What would you do in my position - refuse to pay and just send the forms, pay and hope it works out, go and have a chat with them? I work 9-6 every day, I can leave early sometimes but I don't want to abuse my holiday time as I only just started working there and am really keen on this job.

On the other hand, I am staying for free somewhere right now and would rather not start flat-hunting again because (a) the commute is bad, I have no free time (b) if I am here in october I will feel I am abusing the hospitality and generosity of those currently hosting me and (c) I really like this flat!!",false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,null,null,self,Some advice about renting in London required.,1,http://www.reddit.com/r/AskUK/comments/2hpda4/some_advice_about_renting_in_london_required/

Seriously, we need to have some scope, perspective, or what have you here:

1) We've had a relatively tough run of fixtures to start the season. True, losses to Villa and WHU are frustrating and demoralizing, but they are also comparable to losing to Southampton and Hull City last year. We'll need to really nail down mid-table and bottom-table opponents going forward *just like last year*. 5 of our next 6 opponents are in the bottom half, and we should win our next 4 games if we play like we did against Tottenham and Everton. If we're still struggling come the Chelsea match in a month, then we can start the hand-wringing, but 12 points out of the next 4 matches should see us well up the table.

2) We are only (including all comps) 8 games into our season and the fluidity is improving with each game, as it would while we bed in players. No, we are not doing a Tottenham, it doesn't seem like it, and I don't think anyone outside of the Liverpool camp are even saying it (well, except maybe the scum). Objectively, the performance was much improved yesterday - we merely lacked our cutting edge, which is honestly the last thing to come for gelling teams. If Jagielka doesn't get his wonder strike, the talk is all about improvements, success against a surprisingly resolute defense, and how the season is starting to turn.

3) Other teams (Man U and Southampton in particular) have had a relatively easy run of fixtures to start the year. Comparing their schedules with ours shows we have more winnable points approaching than many of our rivals. While we will *need* those points, it is far better than needing points and having yet played any of the top 6. Technically, Spurs, ManU and Tottenham also *need* points, but have greater tasks in front of them.

4) Injuries. Not only are we bedding in new players, but many of our stalwarts (can I call Joe Allen a stalwart?) are out and this causes so many issues for bedding new players in and continuing along the same lines as last year. BR has said as much. My biggest fear is that Sturridge is fit again just in time for international duty, and Hodgson goes and injures him again. If we end up not getting key players back because of continued injuries, then we have a problem - but not yet.

Obviously, this isn't the start to the season we all wanted. However, if we are being truly honest, did anyone actually expect a title this year? I don't think anyone at the club did, and I for one thought it was highly unlikely. The most reasonable, realistic assessment of a good season this year is a) top 4 consolidation, b) progress to group stages of the Champion's League, and c) manufacturing a deep cup run if not a cup win. These things are all very possible and within our grasp.

Support your team! Quit nay-saying every last thing and find a positive or two. Man City lost to Stoke. Arsenal have 4 draws (4!), and often looked more toothless than we have. Spurs lost a 6-pointer to us *and* to West Brom, Everton lost to Palace, and Man U already have several blemishes. You could bash any of the top 6 right now, but we seem to be the most vociferous, and with arguably the hardest start of any of the top 6 thus far. We controlled the match yesterday, played *well* defensively, and looked a threat going forward, even if we didn't finish well. New signings are bedding in nicely (Lallana, Moreno, Manquillo) and others have ridiculous potential (Balotelli, Markovic, Can). Even Lovren showed strong signs yesterday of coming good.

Feel free to disagree, but I simply think that things aren't all that awful. Yes, some untoward results, but the team is brimming with potential once it clicks and we start finishing, which we will.

-We're all 18+

-We range from about 3000-4000 MMR

-No captain/drafter as of yet.

-Positions are variable, none set in stone as of yet.

-We aren't die hard serious but we'd like to do as well as we can, the weekend itself is more an experience and a bit of fun, but with a competitive edge.

Background: I have a full UK manual car licence. Passed in 2010, so I'm after the 1997 change but before the 2013 change. I can't find this info anywhere or I'm looking in the wrong place, but anyway. I'm 22 so there's no categories I'm not old enough to drive (apart from A as I'm not 24)

I have a category B (and A1 which is a small motorcycle, but that's irrelevant). I want to eventually work my way up to being able to drive 40ft artics, buses, that sort of thing. Also I'd like to be able to tow shit without [doing this, like James May](http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-05/enhanced/webdr04/9/11/enhanced-25447-1399649212-19.jpg).

What progression do I have to go though to get there? I know my B category serves as a provisional licence for bigger/heavier vehicles, but I assume I can't just take a theory test and a practical test for an HGV and then be able to drive anything and everything in between like buses and the like.

I felt this would be a better place to ask than the 'protect and serve' subreddit as it's more UK centric obviously. Apologies for the long post.

During the day of the 7/7 bombings and throughout that summer I was working in a CD and DVD store called Impulse in Liverpool St. Station. I am a second generation British Punjabi man, born and raised in London and as I was a young brown person rocking a pretty big beard it was not unusual for me to get stopped by the police when I was in the station. 

It happened maybe 5 or 6 times and they were always very polite, I'd show them my work ID, they'd peek into my backpack and once they saw there were no explosives they'd be apologetic and go on their way.

These two guys were different though. I was on my lunch break and walking through the station, I saw a big policeman staring at me, I stared back and kept walking. His colleague stopped me a few feet away and the first guy joined us. I explained I was at work and showed my ID and opened my bag. This wasn't enough this time. They wanted to rifle through the entire contents. Fine, I thought.

In my bag there was an 'MIA' CD, she was quite a popular British musician at the time, but around the edges of the album cover there were drawings of tanks. The gentlemen discussed it and wondered if it was suicide bombing related. 

They opened up my tobacco pouch and found a spliff or two, less than half a gram. I'd forgotten it was there. They set a dog on me in front of the crowd of people developing which was nice. A pedestrian asked the police officers for directions to the local post office, they didn't know but I did. ""Good luck bruv"" he said as he was leaving. I mention this because I feel at this stage it must have been quite apparent that I was just a guy at work on my lunch break caught with a bit of weed in my bag.

They gave me two options. I could come to the police station with them, get strip searched, finger printed, get a criminal record and stay there for hours or I could come into a back room with them, get strip searched and as long as there was no drugs (or bombs?!) on me I'd be free to go.

I chose the latter. It was awful. It took them a while to find an office in the station, once they did and I was undressing two or three Underground workers still tried to come in. ""This is the part of the job I hate"" the first guy said, before I had to pull down my boxers. I appreciate that you shouldn't just take my word for it, but the look in his eyes was one of lust, not displeasure. I think 'leering' would be an appropriate way of putting it.

I went back to work and carried on as normal. It became a funny story between me and my (admittedly stoner) friends. Strip Search Red on Black was a nickname that was tried out for a while, and I was often urged to recount the story to new acquaintances, somehow I'd be able to find a punchline and get a laugh.

What happened to me that day? Closeted Police Officers getting jollies? Genuine belief I could be a suicide bomber? They really thought I had other drugs hidden about my person whilst I was at work? What if I was a young female in this scenario that they leered at? That would be inappropriate right?

I have no idea. Thanks for reading.

We currently have a plumbing problem whereby when we run our washing machine our sink fills with water. We attempted to fix the problem ourselves with drain unblocker, and by taking out and checking the u-bend (which was not blocked) but to no avail. We contacted him several times. He ignored all of our e-mails. After a couple of weeks my partner went to his office in person, and spoke to him. The landlord turned up at our flat, refusing to hire a plumber, and said that it was our fault the pipes were blocked because we were 'dirty' and put 'a load of rubbish down the pipes' (patently untrue). He then delivered an unnecessary and rude lecture to my partner about abuse of the building (we are considerate, tidy, and clean tenants and his allegations are unfounded)

He attempted to clean the pipes with drain unblocker, but since, the problem has worsened and when we ran the washing machine tonight the kitchen started flooding. His refusal to address to problem is in breach of contract, as is his refusal to acknowledge our correspondence, as is his verbal harassment and unfounded eviction threats.

a. make sure our pipes get fixed
b. deal with the verbal harassment

I have a Thermaltake Soprano PC tower to give away to anyone who wants it. This case: http://www.thermaltake.com/products-model.aspx?id=C_00000145

It's seven years old, but for the last four years, it's been in storage in a box and covered. It cost £38 new. I don't really want to throw it away as it's good as new, apart from dust. There's also a PSU in the case, but I believe it's no longer working so you'd need to replace it. There's also a CD drive installed which does work.

In addition to the tower, I have a few other things that were inside it:

* 2 x 1GB DDR 2 Corsair RAM
* BFG 8600 GT graphics card
* Gigabyte GA P35 DS3R motherboard, with attached processor (can't remember the spec of the processor)

All of this is free for whoever fancies picking it up from me. I'm based in Kirkby. PM me for an address.

The scrap man is here on Tuesday 30th September. They're usually around in the morning. You have until then to message me and come pick it up. If no one fancies it, then the scrap man can have it all.

Again we finish the weekend without a winner - we're now up to **6 WEEKS** worth of reddit gold to give away. Desperate times call for desperate measures and so begins the first ever week-long Predict for Gold! I'm hoping that by sticking this post to the top of the subreddit we have a record number of participants - meaning - hopefully someone out there will guess correctly!

Guess now or guess Saturday at 13:59 GMT; it doesn't matter but please remember it's only 1 entry per person!

Special thanks to the mods in advance for the stickied post.

Good luck guessing! Let's keep this fun and good spirited! 

-Allergic
________________________


Please leave a comment below stating your prediction for the upcoming game. I need from you:

&gt;**(1) The Full time score (CLEARLY stating the winner; irrelevant if you think it'll be a draw)** 

&gt;**(2) The First goalscorer (irrelevant if you think it's a 0-0er)**

And the answer to this weeks tiebreak:

&gt;**(3) The minute in which the first goal is scored.**

______________________________________________________
**Gold Pot:** 6 Weeks!!
_______________________________________________________

**Rules:**

* Victor will win the amount of Reddit Gold in the 'Gold Pot'
* If a contestant has guessed the first goalscorer and full time score correctly, they must PM me after the 90 mins are up to ensure valid entry. This PM must contain proof that they are an active /r/Liverpoolfc user.
* If two or more people have the same CORRECT predictions for the game, the winner will be the person closest with their tiebreak answer. 
* If there is no clear winner (no one guesses right or two or more entrants have the same prediction and result to the tiebreak question, the gold will be added to the 'gold pot' carry over to the following week)
* One entry per person
* Entry shuts an hour before kick off if 150 entrants aren't found
* Entrants accounts must be older than 3 months
* No obviously edited answers (when the * appears)
* These posts will hopefully be weekly (funds permitting), but will not be posted at the same time each week to hopefully catch only /r/Liverpoolfc lurkers.
* This is obviously in it's infancy so there will be teething problems, please be patient with me.

Auntie gave me new jeans and a cute leather jacket today. Cousin is doing a wardrobe clear out for me. The Coast sale is amazing and I may get one or two other dresses if I can afford them.

I didn't get to watch my film or try my new makeup palette though, and the dogs haven't given me much love today :(

I just feel like previous doctors were much more dynamic, even this early into their respective first seasons, and the more season 8 episodes I see, the more I fear that all we are going to get from this doctor is sarcastic and rude.

I like to think that this is more than just the standard new doctor dislike that everyone goes through after a regeneration. I say this because every other time we've gotten a new doctor, it takes people a while to get on board because the actor is different. This time around I feel like it's more of a case of the character being different. Majorly different. 

In just their first few episodes, we saw fury(Dalek) and helplessness/gratitude(The Unquiet Dead) from 9. We saw sorrow(The Girl in the Fireplace) and witty/clever(The Christmas Invasion) from 10, and 11.... well Matt hit anger, exuberant joy, compassion, and everything in between in his first half season. 

I just feel that so far, 12 has been very one dimensional. I get the new ""old man"" direction they are going, it fits Capaldi and he plays it well. 

I just don't want him to be JUST an old man.

Whilst clearing out her mothers flat, she found an unpaid cheque from solicitor ""A"" which covered a small inheritance from a relative.  The cheque was a few months out of date.

My wife contacted solicitor ""A"" and asked for the funds to be transferred into her mothers acc' and was told that they would only be released to the mother in laws account until A had seen a certified copy of my wife's LPA (Which has to be first gained from our local solicitor and then sent on to A).  

My question is - why is A demanding a certified copy of the LPA to release funds into the original beneficiary account?  If the funds were being released into my wife's account I could understand it, but surly if a fraud was going to occur, it would be up to the bank to safeguard my mother in laws funds as see that only she or her LPA has access to that account?

The cynical part of me believes that this will ultimately result in a higher bill from solicitor A, as obviously the copy obtained from B has to be checked and the various communications will have been logged at £120 per hour or something.  I realise that checks have to be made but I also feel that as these funds are to be transferred to my mother in laws account, solicitor A is being a little unethical?

I run a [gaming charity](http://www.getwellgamers.org.uk/) out of London. A tl;dr of what we do is people donate video games and consoles to us and we bring them to sick children in hospitals across the UK. 

A GameDev in Portsmouth has held an internal drive and gathered a bunch of games and consoles for us to donate to Queen Alexandra Hospital. For GameDev donations, a member of our team usually goes with them to get photos. 

Unfortunately, my team (and I) all have busy lives and with no annual leave on the horizon, none of us can make it down to Portsmouth to facilitate the donation and it's been a wee while now and I don't want to piss off the GameDev.

This would be ideal if you work part-time or are a student and there would be some free games in it for you if you help us out. 

Happy to reply to people here, if anyone wants to make it more personal fire us off an email: getwellgamersuk@gmail.com and I will be in touch.

Cheers
James (Director)

**Southampton 2 - 1 QPR**

Bloody hell. Six in a row, someone pinch me! This match along with Swansea the previous Saturday were exactly the sort of matches that we would've lost or drawn last year and to come away with six points instead of one or two is a massive deal. It's not about how pretty it is, three points is three points! But it also does help when a big beautiful Italian helps you along the way with what can only be described as an absolute stunner.

**Arsenal 1 - 2 Southampton**

I'll be running out of superlatives before long. First time we've won away to Arsenal for 27 years, what an astonishing game. Arsenal didn't field their strongest 11 but it was still pretty bloody strong and don't forget that our starting 11 wasn't what we'd usually start with either. It's wonderful to see us win two consecutive away games after going behind, I can't remember the last time we've done that and looked so comfortable. The second half was difficult to watch as we really packed in to defend the one goal lead but there were a couple opportunities we had on the counter attack that came pretty close. Fantastic win and what a screamer from Clyne! He just can't score boring goals!

**Fourth Round Draw**

Another away game midweek, that's exactly what we need... We've been drawn away to Stoke which is going to make for a very interesting week. On Sat we play at home to Stoke in the league and three days later we travel there for the cup game. Will there be some squad mind games on the cards? Also, we have to travel away to Hull the Saturday after so a pretty unideal draw to be honest but it could've been worse!

Elsewhere in the Premier League
---

Not quite as barmy as last weekend but not bad at all for us. 

[Liverpool 1-1 Everton:](http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/29289928) Both of these teams are going to be at the top end of the table by the end of the season regardless of where they are now. Everton is certainly a team that we might be looking to finish ahead of if you're feeling optimistic. Regardless of your hopes this season, advancing another two points on both Liverpool and Everton can't be bad! 

[Chelsea 3-0 Aston Villa:](http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/29289978) We're never going to finish ahead of Chelsea so it's in our interests for them to beat everyone else this season. Villa suffer their second consecutive 3-0 defeat meaning there is now a three point gap between us. 

[Crystal Palace 2-0 Leicester](http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/29289924) I'd like to think that neither team will be a problem for us this season but Leicester did have the chance to leapfrog us had the results gone in their favour. 

[Hull City 2-4 Man City:](http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/29289927) Another good result here, Hull are looking like an extremely good side this season, going to be a very difficult game indeed when we travel away in October. 

[Man Utd 2-1 West Ham:](http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/29289922) Blimey what an upset! It's a shame this didn't also finish level but we're still a decent amount ahead of both teams. 

[Sunderland 0-0 Swansea:](http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/29289979) I've got a real nasty feeling in my stomach that we're going to struggle to take any points from Sunderland this season. They've drawn five of their six games this season and it was such a frustrating fixture to watch last year, hope I'm proved wrong! Not bad for us though that Swansea couldn't take all the points. 

[Arsenal 1-1 Tottenham:](http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/29289925) Another good result, pulling away on both teams. Spurs looked strong and played well, the Emirates is a difficult place to go and win as we all know! 

[West Brom 4-0 Burnley:](http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/29299350) I don't feel quite as bad about not getting all three points against the Baggies now, they've had a wonderful week. Burnley are really looking like they'll have a shocker of a season although still not quite as bad as that Derby side a few years go...

[Stoke - Newcastle:](http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/29305924) Monday night kickoff so no results yet. A draw or a Newcastle win might be nice though.

Southampton FC's Under-18's squad hosted Brighton at Staplewood on Saturday morning and suffered a 3-1 defeat. Shortly after the second half began, Brighton broke the deadlock before controlling the game to keep a three goal cushion. Substitute Joe Lea clawed one back for Saints but it proved to be just a consolation. [Match Report](http://www.saintsfc.co.uk/news/article/20140927-saints-u18s-1-3-brighton-report-1972731.aspx).

Southampton FC's Under-21's squad travelled away to Everton last Monday evening and also took a 3-1 defeat. Ryan Seager equalised for Southampton shortly after half time but a late brace from Chris Long for Everton proved the difference.

Our next league fixture is away to Spurs on Sunday afternoon. It's going to be an extremely difficult game and I have a hard time convincing myself we're going to come away with anything. Spurs do have a Europa League game on Thursday at home to Turkish side Besiktas and they won't want to lose that so hopefully they'll play a strong side and could pick up a few knocks before Sunday. It's going to test their squad depth for sure. West Brom beat Spurs at their last home game so it is definitely possible and we do have some strong momentum right now. As much as I'd love to win away vs Poch's new side, I just don't think it's going to happen.

The first port of call for any team struggling to score should be to avoid conceding.

This means that when setting up the defence, especially the centre back pairing, the main concern should be the defensive abilities of said centre backs. However our first choice centre back at the moment appears to be Lovren, a very confident centre back who is comfortable in possession and who can play a decent pass. However, defensively I feel he leaves a lot to be desired. For the most part on Saturday we rarely looked like conceding, yet at times Lovren would come sprinting out of position chasing a ball that wasn't his to be won. A few well placed, quick passes could have ended up with Everton attacking a defence missing it's second centre back. Better teams are sure to punish us.

We have also seen a few instances of miscommunication where Lovren is involved, twice with Sakho in the games against West Ham and Tottenham, and on Saturday with Balotelli when he wiped him out attacking a ball in the oppenents box. This leads me to believe that maybe he isn't the most vocal player on the pitch and this could end up leading to mistakes at the back as it did against Tottenham when Nacer Chadli almost scored.

Obviously it must be taken into account that Lovren is a new player in the team this year and he may take time to gel with the rest of the team, but the above examples are a little worrying to me.

Sakho on the other hand had appeared very solid defensively for the most part of his appearances. So I would very much like to see a Skrtel/Sakho partnership in order to address our shakiness at the back. 

However this now looks unlikely following the dropping of Sakho on Saturday and I feel we are in danger of alienating our most solid defensive player, in a similar fashion to the way Agger was. I feel this is down to Rodgers tendency to sometimes play favourites, and the price tag on Lovren does not help the situation. 

I hope that my concerns are proven wrong in the coming games and that whoever is chosen as our centre back pairing is successful and we can get back to winning matches.

What are your thoughts on our CBs?

Its quite viable, considering how buying a house has been so out of reach, that there are a lot of people out there could be just over forty and are living in rented accommodation (often with Children). I am pretty sure the EU could challenge this.  Secondly, what if you have a couple where one person who is 41 and the other 39? They would qualify, but a single person of 41 would not. 

2. They say this will be for 100,000 homes. That does not even cover the amount of people migrating to the country in just one year  (net migration was last recorded at 243,000).

3. Yet again its more market interference by the government. Instead of letting the market establish its own price, they are manipulating prices again using public money. If this happened in any other sector, it would be deemed illegal. 

4. The central enabler of the scheme is developers will be exempt from paying certain taxes and it will take place on brown field sites. So who will pay for local schools, roads leading to the development, health services, shops etc?

The JSA interview I attended last week was an exercise in polite bullying. There's signs everywhere in the jobcentre telling you that looking for work is a fulltime job.

I was told that I had to prove I'd been effectively looking for work for 35 hours a week. When I pointed out, correctly, calmly and repeatedly - from certain knowledge and experience - that professional jobhunters - such as Agency employees - don't even spend anywhere near 35 hours a week looking for vacancies and get paid a vast amount more than I will, I was told to focus on the positive - that I had to fit in the 35 hours over 7 days of the week, not just five.

When I asked them what help they would give me, as I had demonstrated an extra need for help over four of the almost six years I've been unemployed, I was told that the emphasis was on me to help myself. When I went on to explain the illnesses and restrictions which had prompted me to claim ESA after four years on JSA, They were noted inadequately (and it was explicitly stated by the interviewer that they were inadequately noted) and I was told to apply anyway and to let the employer or interviewer decide whether I was worthy of the job.

During the paperwork processing, there was a question about what restrictions I had regarding the work I was able to do. The interviewer, despite having just finished 20 minutes of me explaining why I was on ESA, was going to gloss over this section and say that I was fully able to work, with no restrictions. I'm on ten pills a day, half of which carry a warning not to operate heavy machinery. This was only noted after my strong insistence.

There's more I could bang on about, and the meeting left me raging. I have been on ESA for a year. before that, I was on JSA for four years, during which time I had been placed on the full two years of Work Programme and immediately before that, a year on New Deal. Whilst on both schemes, I was refused the help I asked for, I was told that i was unemployable and I was blocked at any attempt to better my prospects of employment - refused access to the training schemes I needed to refresh the skills I already had, blocked from attending training programmes in areas where i felt I could retrain, laughed at when I submitted a list of a dozen businesses with which I would be willing to work for free as a work trial...

In the three years of forced, enhanced job hunting assistance, I attended one interview - for RBS. I have a terrible credit score because I've never used credit and I have a very old CCJ on my record. My agent knew this and knew that I could never work for a bank because of this. They put me forward for it anyway.

Everything positive that's happened to me work-wise in the past ten years has been despite the jobcentre and despite job clubs and all these enhanced job seeking schemes. It's always been things that I've discovered, pursued and attained on my own.

And now there's nothing I can do. Legally, an employer can't discriminate on the basis of age or disability, but ask yourself this - when you've spent two days interviewing a bunch of bright, eager, healthy 20-somethings who are already doing the job you're interviewing for, only at another company, how are you going to view the jaded 41 year old whose CV has a six year gap on it and who gives a list of ailments and restrictions as long as your arm?

I had an interview for a job last week. I was told by the interviewer that, as I was up against people who were currently working for big tech companies (my skillset is in IT), that I had no chance, but there were a couple of training positions available. If I'm offered one, the training will cost me around £1500 (after discounts for being on benefits), and I will be unwaged until the training is complete. The JC will never countenance footing that bill, and would sign me off if the training position is over 16h/week, but if I turn it down, I'll probably get sanctioned, as there's the guarantee of a job at the end of the training.

The Jobcentre has told me to be positive and concentrate on what I can do rather than what I can't, but at some point they're going to wonder why I'm running to the loo every five minutes, calling in sick at least once a week or passing out at my desk because my blood sugar's too high or low.

I want to work, I need to work...but I need help and advice from someone who knows how I can present myself as employable, because god knows I haven't got a clue how to do that myself.

I'm a recruiter from an agency that specialises in Facilities Management recruitment (both hard and soft services). I thought I would start by posting a rather unique role that I have.

I'm currently working with a very prestigious organisation who are looking for a chauffeur to join a pool of drivers (currently 4 others) who provide services to the organisations senior staff. The hours will work around a standard of 35 hours a week 5 days a week, however it won't be a traditional 9-5 role and individuals will have to be flexible to suit the needs of the organisations. If for example there is a formal evening event you may be required to work from 3 in the afternoon to 11 in the evening. You will work on a Rota basis so from time to time weekend work may be required, this would of course mean time off in the week.

The role will also incorporate an element of close protection security duties as you will be providing a service for high profile individuals. Primarily this will involve liaising with the security personal and providing cover and extra resources as and when required. The role is predominantly a driving role, but individuals do need to maintain a high level of security awareness at all times.

Previous experience in a similar chauffeur/ CP role working with high profile individuals would of course be a massively beneficial factor, however the role could be ideal for an individual who is just leaving the army and has professional driving experience. The organisation are being quite open about previous experience as it is a rather unique role and are happy to provide training.

Candidate requirements:

* Hold a clean driving license.
* A recognised advance driving and first aid qualification would be advantageous, however training may be provided.
* Strong interpersonal skills to interact confidently with Executive Team members and external counter-parties, acting with discretion at all times.
* Excellent organisational and time management skills with the ability to prioritise when required.
* Close Protection qualification or proven track record in this line of work would be advantageous (training can be provided).
* Ability to dynamically assess their working environment and react accordingly. 
* Be able to travel within the UK and internationally, sometimes at short notice.

The role is paying £27,000 per anum on the basic salary, however overtime and other allowances are paid. Any travel that requires staying away from home would of course be covered. Other core benefits include a full career average salary pension (very competitive), private health insurance, 25 days holiday, season ticket travel loans. They also offer other flexible benefits such as additional days holiday, and extension of private healthcare to family members.

If you would like any more information please do PM me and I will be happy to expand.",false,UKJobs,t5_2seb3,null,null,self,[Recruiter] Chauffeur / Close Protection,1,http://www.reddit.com/r/UKJobs/comments/2hs80t/recruiter_chauffeur_close_protection/

I understand the different policies just wanted some advice/opinion on the different companies. Usually I'd check Which? but they're not recommending any until January 2015. 

So far, the only good advice I've had about the companies is that Pet Plan allow the vets to claim the money directly from them, instead of having to pay myself and then claim back.

Dear Mr  Badger

Thanks for contacting us about the BBC News Channel’s coverage of TUC general secretary Frances O'Grady’s speech from Liverpool on 8 September. We are sorry for the delay in this reply reaching you.

We appreciate you would have preferred if the BBC News Channel showed this speech in full, however the channel has a remit for breaking news and a number of news stories were developing while Frances O’ Grady made her speech. This included the announcement of the Duchess of Cambridge’s pregnancy, which we know is of interest to many of our viewers. We recognise that not everyone will agree with our decision to move away from covering the speech, however the pressure of news events does mean that our live news channel will cut away from events such as press conferences and speeches if the news changes.

Throughout the day the BBC News Channel and main news bulletins on BBC One reported on Frances O’ Grady’s speech. The speech in full was available to watch on the BBC News website and was shown on BBC Parliament on 13 September and repeated over the weekend. We believe we reported on the speech and the TUC annual conference sufficiently, and in an impartial manner.

Thanks again for contacting us. 

Kind Regards

The traction control on his car is currently broken, whether this would explain why they crashed I'm not sure. The damage is all to the front end - the bumper is pushed in and there are gaps where it's not in place, the lights are smashed and a lot of paint is missing. He's estimating it's going to cost £1000 to repair or £600 if he uses his insurance but that'll push his premiums up and lose his no claims bonus.

I'm stuck in Canada and feel pretty useless over here so I'm trying to gather as much information as possible and think it's ridiculous they won't pay as he left the car park before he noticed (seeing as it was 9am, his 9 hour flight had been delayed and he had to get to work in Basingstoke I'm not surprised).

Hello everyone! I will be moving out in October and so is my housemate so there are 2 rooms available which would suit a couple! It is basically a massive room and a box room. So it would suit a couple as you would have the big room to share and the smaller room if you need space from each other. The rent is £240 each not including bills.

Alternatively we can rent out the small room (single) for £200 and the large one for £265.

You would be living with 3 girls, all post- uni age (aged 23, 23 and 25), they are all fine art graduates. We would preferably want a non- student just for council tax sake. Message me if you're interested. I thought I would post here before Gumtree as I've seen posts here about rooms wanted.

Lots of middle of the road players (beyond Lukaku, who hasn't exactly hit the ground running). Plenty of time for them to come good (Besic in particular looks like a steal), but players like Atsu haven't exactly lit up the Lower Gwladys End. Eto'o looks like he could do a job here and there.

CB seems to be a major question mark. Distin finally looks like he's past it and Stones is still a little raw. Would've been good to bring in an experienced CB on the cheap to plug the gap between the two..

We didn't get the super fast start we had last season. We are doooooomed. Worry worry worry!

Well, BR says ""Relax"" (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujl3MaGqOP8)

We just lost Suarez, we bought a bunch of players who played in different leagues. Some of them are doing awesome, some of them are not doing so great. Yet. 

But that's exactly what you would expect. Our team at the start of last season was exactly the same team that ended 2012 in a blaze of glory -- that team was settled, got the BR DNA encoded in them. It's not surprising that we blasted off like a rocket. Furthermore, our core team last year remained the same throughout the season, and it's not surprising we got even stronger as the season rolls on.

This year, we are, like it or not, in a rebuilding phase. Losing Suarez is like losing a core gene in our DNA. You can see what BR is trying to do with his acquisitions -- (1) increase depth (2) fix the defense (3) spread the goalscoring around the team more. He has a bunch of new players, and even a world-class coach needs real games to figure out how to best use them. We lost the West Ham game with 7 new players on the field. You do not expect them to fit in right away.

So, give it until December, then decide. You can see BR is tinkering his team from game to game, trying to get them to play with a certain philosophy. He started 2012, added coutinho and sturridge, and got that team to play in an incredible way, all in the space of 1.5 years. But that's the timescale you give him. Now, whether he can do the same again with this team is yet to be seen, but personally, I think he will because of all the LFC managers i've seen in my life (and I started following LFC from the Fagan years), BR is up there in terms of intelligence (only Rafa can compete with BR). Yes, BR is a much better coach than Dalglish and Fagan.

So, like BR says, relax. Watch the games. Enjoy the evolution of our team. By December, we'll be playing in a way that BR wants. it won't be the Suarez-powered attack at all costs team we saw last year. But it will be something else. 

p.s. This applies to Man U too. People write off LVG as worse than Moyes because he has less points at this stage. ON the other hand, I can see what LVG is trying to do. Give him until December, and people will realize why LVG is world class, while Moyes is just a midtable manager.

With Noble and Kouyate out we really needed to be organized to win this weekend, especially in the midfield. Song loves to roam and the biggest knock against him is that he lacks positional awareness (look at the second United goal as an example). It seemed very strange that with our midfield generals out we would go so far in the other direction and give the arm band to someone without an understanding of when to stay home and when to venture forward.

Don't get me wrong, Song is a brilliant player on his day. But a leader of men he is not. On top of all that, he is loan signing who has been with the squad for a month. Not really enough time to command a ton of respect, if you ask me.

**Sahko**

I dont understand why people dont rate him, he has good potential but he does need work on areas. He is still young only 24 and he is one of the future CB for us partnered with Lovren, when Skertel decides to take a step back. 

**Lovren**

Im thinking he starting to gain his feet, he looks more composed and aware on the ball compared with what he was like at the start of the season.

**Manquillo**

Where to start, I think he is promising from what Ive seen from him so far and at 20 I think we should get pen to paper and sign him. I think with him signed we could solve the back 4 issue that we have had in the past. With Moreno, Lovren, Sahko and Manquillo that is a young back 4 and I think they will be here for a few good years. 

**Couthino** 

Hes been out for a few matches but he is one of our key players in the midfield, I think if he gets the space he can work wonders, but he needs to work on finding that space, but once he does he will be a star player in our midfield. 

**Balotelli**

As with any player that comes into a new sqaud, its going to be tough, however I think once Sturridge is back I think the goals will come. After seeing the everton game I can say that he looks like a new person, his work rate is amazing and I think he will find his form and flourish.

***Formation*** 

From what ive seen so far I dont see 4-2-3-1 working, we have enough strikers, why not use them? We always seem a brighter side when we play 2 strikers, we also have alot more games this season so we need every single one to play for rotation. 

I believe 4-3-1-2 is the future, ***if*** gerrard  stops playing. Our midfield is so dynamic with the players we bought in that we can afford to play it and switch players around. I think the future team will look something like this:

                                          Mignolet
                 
                        Mareno      Lovren       Sahko      Manquillo
    

                            Coutinho     Henderson     Lallana 

                                         Sterling
                        
                             Sturridge               Balotelli               

I believe that this will be our best starting 11, however as I said earlier we have so many extra players such as; Lucas, Can, Allen, Markovic and even up front we might have Borini and Origi.

Im looking forward to hear your opinons and please tell me if Ive missed out anything.

However since I'm now very close to 40 my Doctor suggested I needed to lose a fair bit of weight. I'm 6 foot, but a year ago I weighed in at 16 stone and did no exercise.

The only exercise I got was walking to the car, pushing the brake/clutch and turning the wheel, park up at work and have a little walk into the building. 

So a year back the Doc said ""you need to lose this weight!""

""I cant afford the gym in time or money"" I'd replied. The Doctor then asked me how far I lived from work. I didnt know so suggested 15 miles so she suggested I park up and walk or cycle the remaining distance to lose weight that way. 

Turns out I was wrong - the distance when measured in my car was 7 miles from my house to work. Nearly half what I thought it to be. I umm'ed and ahh'ed about it and then when I spoke to a bloke at work turned out he was a cyclist and offered me some advice.

Now I have to confess here: I always had this notion about riders of being reckless red light jumping fools. I had no interest in cycling but had to lose the weight - when you've got kids you want to be around for a long time! 

This guy I know told me the sorts of bikes I could get, where to find advice (the Highway Code is free online and has some cycling advice). He even googled a cycle trainer at the council and I had a couple of lessons with a nice Gent around our Hampshire village.

The point is my views were so clouded by what I thought to be that I never looked into it in any great detail. What riding has given me is this:

1. I lost weight, I am now my recommended Body Mass Index
2. I feel healthier and more happy to start work in the mornings
3. I've ended up saving a fortune on fuel! I mean hundreds £££s! 
4. I actually get to work faster! (Yes and that is with following all the rules) I'm not sat in traffic jams as much half the time and less faff with the bike
5. I even sleep better having done a little exercise
6. We've even been able to ditch the second car saving more money.

Things I found out not to be the problems I thought they'd be
1. Sweat - I don't get as sweaty as I thought I would. I take a flannel into work during the summer and have a wipe around in the loos. (My workmates would definitely tell me if I stink!)
2. My fitness and hills. I got stronger surprisingly quickly
3. The winter. I just layered up, put some lights on the bike and put on a reflective jacket. Sorted.
4. The rain. a) it didnt rain as often as I thought it would and b) my raincoat worked surprisngly well!
5. The traffic. I thought it would be scary/dangerous, but the cycle training gave me a great deal of confidence to manage in it and show my intentions clearly. 

So yeah. I recommend more people try it. ",false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,null,null,self,I recently became a cyclist - and here is why I recommend it,154,http://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/2hswuz/i_recently_became_a_cyclist_and_here_is_why_i/

In 2012/13 we didn't win any of our first five games (with a much worse squad, mind you) and I distinctly remember some of my Liverpool-supporting friends wondering openly whether Rodgers should be sacked until December/January. Nevertheless after buying Coutinho and Sturridge in January, we finished that season playing some of the best football of anyone in the league, including that glorious 6-0 defeat of Newcastle. 

Last year, we had some bad results at the start of the season as well (Losing to Southampton, and to Moyes' United in the League Cup comes to mind) and Rodgers tinkered with different formations, including a 3-5-2. However, after the Stoke game, our team settled, with Gerrard in his new ""quarterback"" role, and Sterling, Suarez and Sturridge in attack, and we all know how well that turned out.

Considering we have started the season having to completely reinvent our formation in defence, midfield and attack, and we have only seen Ballotelli and Sturridge on the pitch for one match, in which they looked extremely promising, is it reasonable to assume that we'll be fine once Rodgers discovers his best team?

After I rolled my eyes for about five hours at the absurdity of this, I decided to buy them another brand of peanut butter anyway.  As an American pb expert, I know that the main distinguishing characteristics of peanut butter are sweetened/unsweetened, and emulsified/unemulsified.  I can see that SunPat is sweetened, but is it emulsified?

If I turn a jar of SunPat (CRUNCHY!) on its side, will the peanut butter flow out, or will it stay completely in the jar?  Do I need to stir a layer of separated oil back in to the SunPat (CRUNCHY!) peanut butter before I use it, or can I open the jar and find it already fully mixed?  This will help me find the closest American equivalent to SunPat.

Don't get me started on their demand for ONLY Jacobs Cream Crackers, no other brand.

Why wouldn’t the fans be uncertain of the appointment? Rodgers hadn’t proven himself as a manager at a top side (no disrespect to Swansea), the club had new owners who seemed to be a tad *naïve* (signing Carroll and Downing for a combined total of £55M is a prime example) and a wave of pessimism had crawled its way into the supporter’s collective conscience after the cancerous ownership of Hick’s and Gillett and the dire days of Hodgson. 

With that, here is a breakdown on Rodgers' Liverpool early form, Gerrard and the traditional slow start that both go through. 

**2012/13 Season** 

Rodgers got his Liverpool off to a “Worst Case Scenario” beginning with a eye-popping 3-0 away defeat to West Brom. Liverpool then had a very impressive 2-2 draw with Champions Manchester City but the progress was hushed with a 0-2 home defeat to Arsenal. 

That Arsenal game occurred on September 2, 2012. Fingers were pointed and reactions were knee jerk. The man many said to drop from the team was the captain. The man that represents what Liverpool as a club is. That man was Steven Gerrard. 

*“He’s 32 and has lost it!”* 

*“Drop Him!”* 

*“Give Shelvey a chance!”* 

These rash and Groupthink comments aside, it took Rodgers’ Liverpool side time to take form and begin racking up the points. Part of this was due to the Gaffers ideas taking shape and how he utilized his players. 

A case study in this upturn can be seen in Steven Gerrard, who was getting used to a new role on the team. When Rodgers tactics began to come to life on the pitch, Gerrard had his *best season in 3 years*, tallying 9 goals and 9 assists in the Premier League in 36 appearances (in comparison with the previous two seasons combined, he featured 39 times with 4 goals and 5 assists in 2010/11 and 5 goals and 2 assists in 2011/12.). 

As Gerrard’s *form* began to take shape, so did the *team*. 

**2013/14 Season**  

Even though the 2013/14 season was by far Liverpool’s best since 2008/09, the team still took some time to gel. The opening three games all resulted in slim 1-0 victories that were great for momentum but not all convincing (re-watch the Aston Villa game and try not to think there was some magic happening for us). 

Bumps were bound to happen (a respectable 2-2 draw away to Swansea and a wholly uninspiring 0-1 home to defeat to Southampton), leading Liverpool to drop points but then the mob mentality began to climb its way back from the bile of negativity and centered its knee-jerk reactions on non-other than club captain Steven Gerrard. 

*“We don’t need him anymore!”* 

*“He drags the team down!”* 

*“Give Alberto a chance!”* 

The game? A 2-0 away defeat to Arsenal on November 2, 2013. 

Yes, Gerrard had a poor game but so did the other players around him (personified by Aly Cissokho’s *world-class speed*).  

After a tough November and December period, Liverpool became a freight train in the league with Gerrard shoveling the coal into the furnace. This resulted in the team coming tantalizing close to lifting the coveted 19th Championship, running eventual Champions Manchester City to the last day of the season. 

Gerrard produced a magnificent season with 34 appearances and tallying a healthy 13 goals and **league-leading 13 assists**. 

As Gerrard’s *form* began to take shape, so did the *team*. 

**2014/15 Season**

With rollercoaster-like results in the early days (a win on the opening day, then a loss, then a win), the team has taken time to find their feat. But after two back-to-back losses in the league (the second time under Rodgers tenure), the fans and media questioned Steven Gerrard’s place in the team again, especially after a lack-luster performance away against West Ham. 

*“Drop him!”* 

*“He’s a fading force!”*

*“Mentally, he has switched off!”* 

Yes, he has been inconsistent but that doesn’t tell the entire story. This isn’t the same Liverpool that lit the league alight in the 2013/14 season. Rodgers is finding his team again and bedding in *6* new first-team players will take time (that’s not taking into account the other 2 coming off the bench). 

But Gerrard is the constant in this tale and on September 27th, 2014 he did what he has done in the past 3 seasons and hushed his critics with a free-kick resulting in a goal against rivals Everton. 

The game ended in a disappointing 1-1 draw (because of a 1-in-a-million thunder strike by defender Phil Jagielka in the dying minutes of the game) but when the whistle blew, Gerrard proved his worth to the team. 

Like many Liverpool seasons before this one, it will have its ups and downs, but to dismiss a figure as inspirational and symbolic as Steven Gerrard in these early days would be a foolish and senseless move.   

As usual, Rodgers tactics and team selection is taking time to gel, but I strongly believe when Steven Gerrard finds form with *his* new surrounding (he isn’t used to some of the new faces), then like in the past, the club will gain momentum and take shape into the free-flowing, precise and winning Liverpool we are accustomed to. 

As Gerrard's form will take shape, so will the *team*.

I'm on the bike, so I can filter between all the cars the whole way over the bridge and its absolutely no problem. 

So here is what I need to know.

When i am filtering, I check my mirror and if there is a biker behind me i will pull into one of the lanes and let them pass. its not a big deal, everyone filters at different speeds and there is no point me holding someone else up. 
So why is it that about 4 times in the last month when i am filtering I get stuck behind another biker who is filtering and wont let me pass. There was one guy I got stuck behind and i let him carry on for a bit thinking he would move, he didnt, so i flashed my lights, nothing. tried to motion with my hand, nothing. Then revved my engine, he just looked at me in his mirror and shock his head. Why not just pull into a lane and let me pass?

I'm currently recruiting on behalf of a multi-national lift and escalator business who are looking for an individual to join their help-desk team responsible for co-coordinating their engineers.

Basic duties involve receiving calls and emails from clients, logging them on the system and dispatching engineers to the required site. Previous help-desk experience is ideal, however they will look at people who have operated in any environment, although people from a facilities background would be desirable (But IT help-desk co-ordination background would be fine). People from a strong administration background will also be considered.

Hours will be 40 hours a week, Monday to Friday. The contract will run up to at least Christmas and may be extended past that point. The organisation are looking to pay in the region of £10 an hour PAYE (12.50 ltd).

If you are interested then please PM me for more details.

If you had asked me last year who the better right-back was I would have said Azpilicueta but Ivanovic has looked like a completely different player this season. Both are strong offensively and defensively but Ivanovic has made a couple of defensive errors this season. 

So what do you guys think? Who deserves a place as the starting right-back for Chelsea? Azpilicueta or Ivanovic.?

My personal opinion is Azpilicueta as he is just as strong offensively and is very strong 1-on-1, maybe even more so than Ivanovic who can often get caught out by fast wingers.

So my question to you Doctor Who Fans is, What is better for me in the long run? What route do I go to have my own complete Doctor Who Collection?

Edit: I did the math. It looks like its only 2 dollars cheaper (USD) if you go with the Matt Smith collection and buying the other formats in DVD. This is only me looking @ amazon and not ebay. Don't really trust ebay when it comes to DVDs. The price was 344 to 346 and in my case, I will lean towards the Limited Edition Blu Ray set and buy the last two specials (time of the doctor and day of the doctor)

And it's quite frankly distressing for several reasons (beyond my being a fan of Moffat). 

A. The Bechdel test is a far cry from an objective test one can preform on something and receive a solid, verifiable answer.

B. This is a direct quote from a friend of mine, and it brought to light some interesting facts ignored by the ""infographic"":

Oh this is ridiculous. Fun fact: Almost every episode that Moffat actually wrote passes the Bechdel test (I’m counting two parters as one long episode, since that’s really what it is) except for Asylum of the Daleks.

Moffat wrote a grand total of two stories during Rose’s run (Empty Child/Doctor Dances and Girl in the Fireplace). *Both of them pass the Bechdel Test.*

You want to know which of Rose’s episodes don’t pass the test? Dalek, The Long Game, Father’s Day, Boom Town, Rise of Cyberman/Age of Steel, and The Idiot’s Lantern. That’s 6/21 stories, giving Rose a 15/21 or 71% pass rate. Had Moffat not written during her run, it wouldn’t have made a difference. Even if you count individual episodes, you would only be able to count the Empty Child, and Rose would have a 78% pass rate with Moffat and an 80.5% pass rate without him. **Not. statistically. significant.**

Martha’s run had 3 ‘fail’ episodes, for a 10/13 or a 77% pass rate. If you take Blink out, you have a 9/12 or a 75% pass rate.

Donna does not have a 100% pass rate. The Runaway Bride fails (I’m pretty sure), and so do Planet of the Ood and The Sontaran Stratagem (there are at least 3 named female characters in SS, but none of them talk to each other about something other than a man). That’s an 11/14 or a 79/80% pass rate. Taking out Silence in the Library/Forest of the Dead would make that number much lower, ranking in at a 9/12 or once again at a 75%.’

Also, I find it interesting that this article (nor any of the comments) mention that nearly ALL of the episodes of the Moffat era that fail the Bechdel test are either genre pieces where you wouldn’t expect to see any women in the first place (Curse of the Black Spot, Cold War), pieces focusing on emotional development or emotional trauma of a specific character where it was necessary to cut out any non-crucial conversations (Vincent and the Doctor, The Girl Who Waited), or simply only have two characters period (Journey to the Center of the TARDIS). In fact, the only Moffat-era episodes that fail the Bechdel Test that I cannot justify are The Lodger and A Town Called Mercy. They're also not written by Moffat.

All *stories* that Amy is in that Moffat actually wrote pass the Bechdel Test (besides the controversial Eleventh Hour, where nobody seems to be able to agree if it passed or not; I think it did). The only *episodes* he wrote that did not pass were Day of the Moon and Asylum of the Daleks.

We also know that the Bechdel Test is HIGHLY subjective (what counts as passing, for instance? I’ve looked at three ‘Doctor Who and the Bechdel Test’ studies: one of them failed The Eleventh Hour and the other two didn’t. Two of them failed Journey’s End and one of them didn’t. One of them counted Amy and Amy in The Girl Who Waited as two people and so passed the episode, and another one of them counted them as the same person and so failed it) and that the test is a highly simplistic and highly flawed way of looking at the film industry in regards to sexism. Please recall that most of the Harry Potter movies fail the test where Twilight passes.

The Bechdel Test measures only volume/quantity, not quality. It measures female interaction, not female involvement or female complexity. It is far too simplistic of a test to accurately measure anything related to female characters, and should not be taken as any kind of fact. Failing the test does not mean a film or show is sexist, nor does passing the test mean that a film/show is not.

Additionally, holding the Davies companions as “champions of feminism” kind of ignores all the problems he had for the sake of vilifying Moffat. Stop glorifying Davies. Yes, I love him. No, I don’t think he was the paragon of feminism that feminists seem to think he was (of course, I don’t particularly care either, but that’s a different issue and a different post).

So tl;dr: out of 29 episodes that Davies himself wrote, 5 of them conclusively fail the Bechdel test (there are three others that are debatable). That’s an 86% pass rate or a 72% pass rate if you count the three debatable ones, people. Out of 24 episodes that Moffat has written for New Who (from Rose to Clara), only 3 of them (The Doctor Dances, Day of the Moon, and Asylum of the Daleks) failed the Bechdel test. That’s a 21/24 or an 87.5% pass rate. And yet no one’s over here trying to call Davies sexist, even though he has a lower Bechdel Test pass rate than Moffat.The Bechdel Test is a highly subjective, highly simplistic test that is designed to look at TRENDS in media, not a single work, and trying to determine whether a work is sexist from the Bechdel test is utter BS.

The TL/DR was TL/DR:
If you look just at the episodes that Moffat wrote, and the episodes that Davies wrote, Moffat has a higher Bechdel test rating than Davies. And also the Bechdel test is a poor judge of feminist quality.

I had a decent convo yesterday with my man on all things Poch and Saints. I have already put a couple of bits up and was going to post the rest yesterday but then thought it was best to wait until all the post match hysteria had settled.
Anywho, Poch was thoroughly p*ss*d after the WBA game. Had all the players in for an absolute rollicking, and told them all they needed to sort themselves out because he was here to win, and he would not put up with players who did not feel the same way. It has become very apparent to him that training and match day attitudes are very different in some of the players. They have been excellent in training and have taken to his methods and ideology very well. It doesn't make sense that come match day so many of them just revert to their old ways and style of play. Andros is very much his biggest frustration in this respect.
I have said all along that Poch doesn't fancy him at all and doesn't think he fits in how he wants to play, but apparently he has upped his game in training, but come match day just forgets/ignores everything he has been asked to do. Poch has seen enough in training to think he can cut it, but he needs to turn that into match form very soon because he is still very close to being pushed out of the door the way things stand.
The players were told very bluntly that if any of them thought they were better than his philosophy, they were not. He has been told he has full control over who plays and who doesn't and those not in his plans will be transferred, or left to rot. Levy has told him he will be given time to get the squad to where he wants. Whether that is just typical vote of confidence stuff who knows, but that is what he was told last week.
Jan
Was not happy at being left out of the Prem starting 11's. He has NOT kicked up a fuss, and has NOT thrown his toys out of the pram. His main concerns are regarding his Belgian position and he knows he needs to be playing at at least Prem level regularly to get in what is a very competitive Belgian side. He almost missed out playing in the WC because of last season and hardly playing at CB. Poch had him in last week and explained it was simply a case of not wanting to play Fazio with another relatively inexperienced CB so split him and Kaboul just to get Faz settled. He will be first choice to play with Eunice as long as he is playing well. Verts understood and was very happy with this. Whether this has anything to do with his contract situation I have no idea.
Kaboul
Daws and Sandro were both very popular within the dressing room, and there were a few murmurs from other players being heard around the place bringing things down a notch. Kabs was the one who stood up in front of them all and told them all to stop whining and that they needed to pull together. Players move etc etc, Spurs carry on and get stronger. It as very well received by the players as he is obviously very well respected. Defended Poch's position, and yet also came across as one of the lads, hence the final tick for him getting the armband.
KO time yesterday I have mentioned elsewhere, Sky over ruled the Met bizarrely.
MS also mentioned elsewhere, was very close to being agreed at £18mil prior to his WC call up. He gets back and the price is £27mil. All because of how much Yanited and Pool paid for Shaw and Lalanna.
Expect us very much in for Rodriguez and another ST in January.
Remember this was all pre yesterdays match, maybe some of it has sunk in

I certainly do not disagree. I do, however, want to suggest that it may have been multidimensional in nature: I think that it was also intended to serve as an exercise in quick attacking.

The problem during the West Brom game was obviously our lack of attacking attitude and urgency. We seemed generally to be in the proper positions most of the time and moving in generally the right direction, only far too slowly. Pochetino made this clear in the post-game interview. We were ponderous, lackadasical in our pressing and dallying on the ball. This allowed WBA defenders to regain and hold their shape, falling back into two banks of defenders ranged against our attacking players. Many during and after the game suggested that our attacking players lacked belief or quality in the final third, but for me--and I think for Pochetino as well, judging from his post-game comments--the problem was the slow transition from defense and pressing to attack in the middle third of the pitch. By not pushing the ball forward to attacking positions quickly, the likes of Adebayor, Lamela &amp;co. had very little space to run into; they faced a phalanx of defenders who did well to maintain their shape.

Pochetino's system, then, relies on a quick transition to bring about attacking moves before defenders can regain their shape. He needs every man on the squad to participate in that transition: the back four and defensive midfielders need to get the ball up to the attacking quartet as quickly as possible, and that attacking group needs to get themselves into open space at the same time. To do so effectively requires a mindset finely tuned to flip a switch from defend to attack at the right moment--and what better exercise in this than a counter-attacking game. Pochetino's aims are not typically counter-attacking, so much as quick-attacking, but by having us sit deep and soak up pressure he set up our attacking players to keep half a mind ready to spring into the acres of open space created as Arsenal's players drifted ever farther down the pitch. Putting Mason in--and showing remarkable confidence in an untried player--encouraged that, as he's a player who would look for that space and exploit it.

It's not that uncommon for managers in many sports to have players adopt temporarily a style geared as much toward changing their mentality as toward winning--Sherwood spoke of switching to 4-4-2 in order to encourage the attacking players to adopt a more aggressive approach. I think we may have seen the same this past weekend. 

Of course, Pochetino was wise to adopt the strategy he did, and not only because it worked; I think it gave us the best chance of getting something out of the match. I think it's also part of a longer-term project to instill a quick-attacking mentality in the team. It will be interesting in the future to see if he repeats the sit deep and counterattack strategy against the better teams. Perhaps the seeds of this more pragmatic approach were sown against Liverpool a few weeks ago, when a more aggressive plan allowed them to play their strongest game against us.

So why were we still bound by our agreement after two revolutions? Surely the government that the deal was made with has long gone.

To keep a long story short I tried to buy an item through Paypal for £300 and it just wasn't working. The payment kept saying it was processing and the seller was sending me requests that we're not coming though. Me and the buyer eventually came to a mutual agreement that it wasn't working and he should try to sell it to someone else.
I thought that was the end of that, but about 3 days later, all of the attempted payments came through and 3 direct debits came out of my account for the item, triple what I originally intended to pay around £900. Obviously I noped out and called my bank who immediately reversed the transactions for me through the direct debit guarantee and stopped the DD because there was clearly an error on the system. I thought that was the end of that.
Nope. Because a few days later, Paypal credited my account for one payment of the item £300. By this point I thought weird shit was going down, but I withdrew the money and its sitting in my bank account now.
Not sure what to do, do I call Paypal and tell them? Or do I sit on it and wait for them to call me (which they may not)?

As I mentioned last week, every Tuesday I'll be posting a short quiz to test your knowledge of Southampton FC. If you're a fairly new supporter then don't worry about not getting most of these, when I reveal the answers you'll hopefully have learnt something else about the club! And as for people that have followed and lived in Southampton for many years, you've got no excuses!

Every Tuesday I'll post between five and ten questions of varying difficulty, sometimes there will be a running theme but not always. Instead of posting the answers for everyone else to see in the comments, please send me a PM! On Thursday I'll reveal the answers as well as the users with the highest score. Feel free to discuss in the comments below as long as you don't give anything away! Of course you could probably google the answers to these in a matter of minutes and there's nothing I can do to stop you but that wouldn't be very fun would it? So I trust you all to answer honestly and without the help of Wikipedia! 

Seeing as this week is the first time we do this, I won't make it too difficult as I know there's quite a few new people on this sub. 

---
1) What year was the club founded?

2) What was the last trophy we won?

**A: yes it is a strange position to take for a shot from distance. Who knows if he would have got it with hands higher? More chance.**

Q: mignolet or hart?” 

**A: Hart**

Q: do you reckon Liverpool should sign Valdes ?” 

**A: Yes all top clubs now have 2 keepers contesting the number 1 spot.**

Q: should Mignolet be dropped?” 

**A: NO**

Q: do you think Liverpool need a new goalie? Gary blamed the Jagielka goal on Mignolet. Looked unstoppable to me.

**A: It wasn't a mistake but a technical point on starting position that would have given him more chance of saving it.**

Q:  One signing you can make for Liverpool if you have all the money in the world?” 

**A: REUS- pace goals and assists!**

Q: Do you rate Markovic?” 

**A: Struggled to start with but only young assess him more after Xmas.**

Q: following criticism of Mignolets body position, what are your thoughts on his ability to deal with crosses?

**A: think he needs to be more positive as the manager said after West Ham.**

Q: Do you still secretly love Everton?”

Q:If you could change one rule of the sport what would it be?” 

**A: Own goals don't count!!**

So, we was looking to have started a tournament by now, if you can't tell, we haven't. Let me explain to you what went wrong, and what I can use from you.

Firstly, the tournament is still running, but maybe delayed a little. The reason we closed without a trace, was todo with our co-founder. He couldn't keep up his end of the bargain and that caused our demise. Don't worry, he is now gone. 

This does mean it is a one man project. And I do need people to help me (I work a 9-5 job as I am sure most you do, and I also like to play games, so the time I can spend is slightly limited) I would like people who would are passionate about dota, about this community to form up and see what we can do for UK dota and DotA worldwide.

Whatever you can offer, I am sure it'd be useful in some way, please drop me a PM. More info will be on our website soon.

I was gifted a poster from the 50th anniversary of the show. As a tribute  to my love for the program I have taken upon the task of trying to get as many of the signatures as I can of the actors depicted. While I have watched the last 5 doctors I'm having some trouble identifying some of the older characters as I'm work my way slowly but surely through the older series'. If R/DoctorWho Would like to help me with the names of the characters and actors which they know that would be much appreciated :)

What I will say is that I believed that one council employee acted improperly and very unprofessionally, causing danger to my household and family. I submitted a complaint through the council website and who should be dealing with it? The person I complained about. He wrote about the complaint in a letter, but missed out several vital points. It looks like he's trying to change the nature of the complaint and even suggested in the letter ""sorting this out over the phone or face to face"".

It feels a bit like intimidation to me. Is this normal procedure for dealing with complaints or should I take this higher? It looks really dodgy to me. Anyone work for a local authority know if this is how things are done? To me this looks like a massive conflict of interest.

I'm a fourth year photography student and for my final year project I'm looking into photography and crime, crime scenes and police photography. 

I want to do a portraiture project of anyone who has been a victim of, or taken part, in any crime, whether it be minor (as small as stealing a glass from a bar or getting your phone stolen!) or major (all the big ones). 

Ideally I'd like the photograph to be of your face, with a first name. I might also want to take the name (as such) of the crime but that's up to discussion with the individual (don't let that put you off!)

I'd rather he dropped back and we played another striker.

However the weakest link for me looks to be Burke now. After a couple of good games right at the start of the season he seems to have gone a bit shit. There is now more pressure on Antonio to perform while Burke is faffing about, and unfortunately it looks like people have worked out how to deal with us. The guy who wrote that Fulham blog on us appears to have nailed it rather well.

&gt; motorcycle boots or other sturdy footwear that provides support and ankle protection 

Now, herein lies my curiosity.  
What I currently wear, while riding, are [Dianese Street Bikers](http://www.dainese.com/eu_en/street-biker-d-wp-19056.html), and while I believe them to be motorcycle short boots [and they have CE and EN certifications relating to safety], I don't think I want to risk an issue of the examiner deciding they aren't suitable.  
[when it comes to full length boots, I've not yet been able to find a *pair* that fits well, due to a snapped ankle when I was younger. Full length ones end up being REALLY uncomfortable and far too on that leg at the ankle. Short boots don't have that problem for me.]

I was just wondering whether people had start a similar venture in the past &amp; the best way to go about it? I know it needs to be discussed with the council &amp; a potential petition should be made - what's the quickest, easiest way to push the idea?

The market will most likely run late afternoons &amp; some plans are to include entertainment to get an all-round interesting vibe for the event that's engaging &amp; lively, &amp; is somewhere people want to head to. If anyone had some suggests where they think might be a great place to have one too, please let us know!

Thanks in advance Bristol!",false,bristol,t5_2r52c,null,null,self,New Street Food Market: Advice?,8,http://www.reddit.com/r/bristol/comments/2hvytd/new_street_food_market_advice/

Hey everyone, I thought it could be a good idea to have a weekly thread on [Fantasy Premier League](http://fantasy.premierleague.com/). /u/thejayarr used to do this every gameweek last season and I thought I'd follow him for this season. It's going to be on how the [/r/Everton Fantasy PL 2014/15](http://fantasy.premierleague.com/my-leagues/13351/standings/) league is going, with updates on who is in the top 100, who has scored the most points and who has had the biggest rise in rank within the league.

If you'd like to join the league, the code is [36817-13351](http://fantasy.premierleague.com/my-leagues/13351/join/?autojoin-code=36817-13351).

Correction: this thread is actually for **Gameweek 6**, not 7.

---

**Top 100**

*Note*: Under the manager column, I'd like to have everyone's username instead of their real name. So if you're able to [send me a PM](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=JaumeBG) telling me who your team is or write it down in the comments, that would be great.

The top floor newly refurbished office features 3 main rooms, 150 Mbps broadband, a kitchenette and a balcony with views over Oxford. 

We're preferably looking for people in the media industry, since there will hopefully be opportunities for cross-promotion and working collaboratively. If you're not in the media industry get in touch anyway!

As well as the desk space you will have unlimited access to our meeting room, providing it is not already booked of course. 

The location is second to none if you want somewhere central with a lively atmosphere both during the day and night. 

Please pm me if you're (or know anyone that might be) interested in taking a desk and we'll take it from there.

The win against Aston Villa brought his all time wins with Chelsea to 165, putting him in second alongside former Chelsea manager Dave Sexton (1967-1974).

Sexton was probably best known for managing club icons like Bonetti, Harris, and Osgood. As well as the [1970 FA Cup Final](http://youtu.be/awdy0P_ujNs).  The Independent also ran an [article/obituary](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/dave-sexton-footballer-who-went-on-to-manage-chelsea-qpr-and-manchester-united-8348837.html) about Sexton the day after his passing which does a really good job profiling the man.

To become Chelsea's most winning manager Mourinho will have to surpass David Calderhead (1907-1933), who has a record of 384-239-343.

I have a Masters degree in a field which is not one of those ""job-specific"" fields (e.g. Biochemistry, etc.) so I cannot really find a more relevant, or simply a better job more suitable for someone with a degree. Instead, for the past two years, I am stuck with this cleaning job which pays the bills, but that is probably the closest attachment I have to it. 

I am looking to widen up my skillset and improve my skills in general. I was thinking going into apprenticeship for this very reason, however, I am not sure how exactly it works, e.g. what are the conditions for me to be able to apply... do I need to be a young person (I am 25 atm) or  a student, or is this for everyone?

I understand the point of apprenticeship is to get inexperienced people into the field of work where they earn low wages but at the same time get qualifications, certificates, etc. ultimately allowing them to find a better job when qualified enough. But I am unclear on whether it is for young people, students and so on only.

If anyone can expand a bit and explain in a layman's terms, I'd welcome it.

Getting into the city centre of Notts can be a ballache, and Sonny's shop is really easy for me to get to when I do site visits for some of my clients out that way.

**Name:** S&amp;M Tobacconists Ltd 

**Location:** Long Eaton. [Google maps link here.] (https://www.google.co.uk/maps/place/S%26M+Tobaccanists+Ltd/@52.899798,-1.272563,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x4879e8e7dff1f735:0xa0b04bba917f135d)

**Overview:** This tiny shop is run by Sonny and Maninder Samra, and it's a tobacconists/newsagent. The shop is located on the A6005 roundabout , and the best way to park is to take the western exit on the roudndabout if you're coming from the East and then take the first left. Then you're on a residential street with an ATS Euromaster - you can park here, but ask the guys in the garage if it's ok to park there while you go see Sonny and they'll be fine with that as they all know the shop well.

The shop has a great selection of pipe tobaccos and cigars, it's amazing how much they cram in considering how snug the shop is! Sonny is a very knowlegeable cigar aficionado and I've had some thoroughly pleasant chats with him on my visits - he's a hobby man like all of us. They stock a decent selection of premium tubed cigars of both new world and Cuban origin, as well as good quality machine made cigars and cigarillos. The prices are as good as I've seen in a brick and mortar shop. [As you can see from these photos,] (http://imgur.com/a/Kz5Om) most of our favourites are covered and there's something for everyone. If you don't see what you want, it's worth asking Sonny if he has it out back in the larger humi that's not on display.

There's also a good selection of accessories, really nice lighters and cutters of top quality brands.

So although it's not a big shop with a walk in humi, it's the perfect place to go when you want to pick yourself up a little something for the collection or you want some everyday smokes of assured quality. 

**Competitive Prices:** 4/5

**Knowlege:** 5/5

**Service:** 5/5

**Selection:** 3/5

**Atmosphere:** 5/5

Roma are without Castan (CB), De Rossi (CDM) and DeSanctis (GK) today so if we can have a solid defensive game and apply a lot of pressure to the relatively new faces in their defensive line, I think we can come away with all 3 points.

I'm undertaking a little rebuild project on a Honda CG125, and I need to know a few bits and bobs before I order some more parts.

I'm finding new gauges online that just show speed, and omit various other displays that are on my model. By law does my display have to have a tachometer, indicator display etc.?

City basically built their team around Yaya last season. Their priority was to find a midfield pairing for him and got their man (Fernandinho) and in return Yaya played fantastically.


I don't know what's happening with him but when he is the centre piece of the team and is prone to his lackadaisical moments (that have been lasting 90 mins this season) the whole team becomes spineless. He offers nothing except one or two good passes per game. He doesn't even seem as though he's going to go on his bulldozing runs any more.


Rather than signing Fernando who was a Javi Garcia replacement, we should have signed a Yaya replacement (Vidal, Pogba, Matuidi or Milner as CM even?). Maybe we need to change the way our team plays? Maybe we should build our team around David Silva instead and not a 31 year old Toure.

Lastly I can understand he may be grieving still over his brother and his heart may not be in football at this moment in time, but why is he so un-droppable? Lampard has stepped up, Milner has been playing out of his skin recently so you could give anyone of them a go. Nonetheless we need to face the reality that MCFC may need to move on from Yaya being out star man. It's time to use this season as a transition to slowly phase him out and bring in his replacement.

The English course carries on until mid-December, but I was only teaching until early September and then my work ended.



HOWEVER: the contract I received from HR said I was to be employed from the end of July until mid-December (I'm guessing they thought that because I was teaching on the course, I was going to be teaching for the whole thing and not just the first few weeks as I did). The languages department (who I was employed under) were really poorly organised and seemed to have a really bad system of communication with HR, which would explain that.



So, as you might expect, despite having finished the job several weeks ago, I've just received a full months' pay for September, and I'm guessing I will do for October as well, and for part of December. I was employed with a few other tutors under the same circumstances (including wrong dates on their contracts) and I expect the same has happened to them.



It's the uni's mistake and they had plenty of money to throw at the project from their extortion of the foreign students, and I'd be happy to take the money (who wouldn't?) after having a bit of a nightmare there with the awful management and admin staff. My employers in the language department seemed oblivious to the incorrect dates on our contracts.



I've obviously got a couple of worries though. Aside from the moral obligation, I may be going into a new job fairly soon, which means I'll be receiving money from another company, and thus will be put on an emergency tax code.   I'm guessing as well that both my old and new employers will know I'm receiving money from two places, because they'll have to apply the emergency tax code in accordance with that. I'll also have to go about getting my P45 to give to the new place, which could complicate things.



I've tried Googling it but all I can find is people saying they've been paid after finishing their jobs - the difference here is that I'm technically (according to the contract) still an employee at the university, but not being given any work by my manager.

**TEAM NEWS** (Courtesy of BBC Sport)

 Midfielders Casper Sloth and Luke Murphy are pushing for recalls as Darko Milanic takes charge of his first home game as Leeds boss against Reading.

Leeds lost 2-0 to Brentford in Milanic's first game on Saturday and he could be tempted to make changes, although he has no new injury or suspension worries.

Midfielder Jake Taylor is a doubt for Reading with a hamstring injury.

Winger Hal Robson-Kanu could figure after recovering from a knee injury.

**MATCH FACTS** (Courtesy of BBC Sport)

------------------------------

**Sgt_General's Predicted XI**

                   Silvestri    

       Byram   Bellusci   Pearce   Warnock

                    Bianchi    

         Murphy                 Mowatt    

                     Sloth    

          Antenucci         Doukara

I have to be honest here: I don't really know what the team is going to look like. We'll only start to get a feel for the players favoured by Milanic and the kind of team he likes to put out after a few games under him, so his statement that the side will see some changes after our dismal performance against Brentford only makes the picture more confusing. Where will we see these changes? Between the posts is the most unlikely area, as Silvestri has been staking a strong claim for our player of the season award so far. I still consider the defence an area that will - or should - see very little change because the four listed above form our strongest, most balanced back four out of the players we have available.

Midfield seems like the most obvious place to change personnel. We were decisively defeated there against Brentford and with so many midfielders at the club it seems likely that some others will be given a chance to shine. I fear that this may be the end of Lewis Cook's run in the side, although I genuinely hope not because he has definitely been a crucial part of our strong performances in recent games. Bianchi strikes me as the only other player we have at our disposal who can play Cook's role with any kind of assurance, so I could see him slotting in there with Murphy making a return to the starting line-up on the right. I could see Mowatt maintaining his place, as he gives us balance as a natural left-footer, but I suspect that Austin will drop to the bench in favour of Sloth, who will be given a chance with the Jamaican international reserved to make an impact later in the game.

I just can't see Antenucci and Doukara being dropped, though. Maybe Milanic will surprise me, but these two are easily the most dynamic, multifaceted strikers at the club and I think that - on paper - they offer more as a front two than any other combination at Elland Road, so they deserve another chance. Perhaps we will see Morison finally come into the reckoning though, as he is a more natural replacement than Sharp, but we could also see Sharp being used in a home fixture that I could see being an open game. Two options that I expect us not to use, however, are Adryan and Montenegro, who took part in the development squad fixture and are unlikely to feature.

**Sgt_General's Prediction**

1-1 draw

After a disappointing performance against Brentford, I just can't see us returning to the heights we hit during Redfearn's tenure so soon. Especially now that the games ahead of us are set to only increase in difficulty. Reading are a good side, capable of carving other teams open, and we'll do well to come away with something - especially considering our poor record against this club. If we're not careful they're going to turn into a bogey side for us - if you don't think of them as one already.

Tobes has more experience internationally over Gardos and can play RB, but Gardos is no slouch. Performed well in the few games he's featured, and looks a potential goal threat too. Toby seems less likely to sneak in a few goals.

Also Toby is a loan with a clause that would allow Athletico to deny a permanent buy-out. Would hate us to build up a player who just leaves at season end.

So I'm a student who has just moved into a new house with 7 other people, and we decided to get Virgin Media for our internet, however, a lot of us are experiencing internet drop out issues in our rooms (house is quite big, old victorian building). I plan on ranting and raving at them on the phone tomorrow like I did today to try and get them to do something, but I have a feeling it's not going to do anything.

So other than buying a wireless network extender, is there anything I can do? It's getting ridiculous now, to the point in the evening where we have to bring our laptops into the living room (where the hub is located) just to get internet sometimes) just to get internet.

We're paying £26.50 for horseshit and I'm not happy. So please help!


P.S If it helps, we're located in Bristol.

He knows that humans can be vicious and cruel, that their blood lust will destroy stuff. His companions even help him stay a better person. In the episode with the broken Dalek in season one, Rose helps him remember that he is a Doctor, not a Dalek. It's one of the things I like the most about Doctor Who. It does have messages that mean something, and showing the bad traits of humanity is very useful because it can help us grow. 
He doesnt give any1 else a chance. 

tl;dr: the doctor forgives humans for being bad people. People are bad people.

I have a few bits and pieces that might be useful - a network switch, an (old as hell) ProLiant server, and some basic tools for electronics.

Why does Pellegrini not give Nastasic a go? His first season at the club was outstanding. To not even play him in the cup is just stupid. For me, this is Demichelis' last season at the club. We have great young talented centre backs (Nastasic, Rekik, Mangala, Denayer + Boyata?) every game he plays is just stunting the growth of one of our young players.

Today is the start of October (Blimey that time already?!) and I'll be having a brief look at the state of our season way back in 1994. Things were different back then, Football had only been played officially for two years, the record transfer fee was Paul Gascoigne to Lazio from Spurs and I was almost ready to be born!  

---
1st October 1994 - 20 Years ago
---
---
The 1994-95 season got off to a poor start as the Saints picked up just two points after their first four games leaving us 18th in the table. But when September arrived, things looked much more positive and Southampton took 7 from three games to move up to 13th. 

---
**Results prior to 1st October**

Southampton 1-1 Blacburn Rovers

Aston Villa 1-1 Southampton

Newcastle 5-1 Southampton

Southampton 0-2 Liverpool

Tottenham 1-2 Southampton

Southampton 1-1 Nottingham Forest

Coventry 1-3 Southampton

---
On this day in 1994, Southampton hosted Ipswich Town and after their poor start to the league had the chance to progress to 8th place. [The teams lined up as follows](http://imgur.com/2UJecCK), how many names do you remember? 

13,000 visited the Dell and were left frustrated at half-time after a goalless first half but things soon picked up as Neil Maddison and Ronnie Ekelund took the Saints two nil up. But Ipswich refused to lay down and clawed one back with 15 minutes left on the clock thanks to substitute Ian Marshall. With just a one goal advantage and Ipswich pressing for an equaliser, it was looking rather tense but thankfully Iain Dowie made it 3-1 and gave Southampton a great sigh of relief.

I feel like they are currently in pretty good shape but am after some suggestions on how best to apply them in the future. 

I currently run a monthly budget through YNAB (fantastic bit of software) and have managed to achieve an equilibrium where I am saving approximately 50% of my take home pay. The question is what should I be doing with it?

I have just taken out a mortgage with my partner on a property. The current deal in place is a 30 year mortgage currently fixed for 2 years at 2.49%. The property cost £150,000 and we managed to save up enough for a 20% deposit leaving a mortgage balance of £120,000.

The mortgage was taken over 30 years with the intention of making regular overpayments to bring it down over time. After everything is taken into account from the budget I am left with roughly £700 a month to ""save"". Is the best place for this my mortgage? 

The remainder of my savings consist of £10,000 sitting in a cash ISA earning a rubbish 1.3% interest. I plan on keeping roughly 3k of this as a liquid emergency fund and transferring the remainder to a S&amp;S ISA as a long term investment. This is my second quandary, would my savings be better off placed into this account rather than the mortgage?

Both my partner and I are in very stable government jobs with a defined benefit pension that we are paying into. I take home roughly £1600 and she £1400.

Any advice?

I am a dual US-UK citizen.  I have never lived in Britain (although I have visited before).  I am thinking of living in the UK when I'm in university and/or after that.  I was looking on GOV.UK recently and saw that at 16, if living in the UK, I would get assigned a National Insurance number automatically, but, I'm turning 16 in January (2015) and I don't live in the UK.  So, it seems that there is a different procedure to get a number between the ages of 16-20 than the procedure to get one after 20.  I will most likely be getting a job here in the US at 16, most likely paying more than the dollar equivalent of 151GBP/week.  So, my question is this:  If I make more than 151GBP/week at/after turning 16, will I have to pay National Insurance?  I won't have a number and I do not know how to do it without one.  Also, if I don't move to the UK until after the age of 20, will that cause issues with getting a number?  Lastly, if I get a number when I move there, will there be a gap in my National Insurance record from between the time I turned 16 (and started at a job) and the time I got the National Insurance number?

When I talked to talktalk about it, we agreed that the issue was the quality of the copper wiring coming from the call centre to my house. The only way to fix it is to upgrade to fibre but that is an 18 month contract which is a no-go and don't really know what other options there are to fix it.

I'm 18 and will be starting university next year, most of my mates started this year. I've applied to universities close to me because my parents are willing to put up with me which will save me over £6K per year in accommodation.

When I told my mates about this, quite happy about finding a couple of places so close, they were really surprised that I wanted to do that. They were saying how they wanted to move away to get 'the experience'. My answer was basically that living at home could be annoying sometimes, but not £6K annoying. The overwhelming response was, quite annoyingly for me, that it doesn't matter- my student debt would cover it.

I've seen this attitude with a bunch of things, from using it to cover nights out to a government rep selling us the idea of student loans and how it's brilliant because we wouldn't even have to pay it back if we didn't get a job- how great is that?

To me, debt is a bad thing which I want to avoid if at all possible. If I am in debt, I don't want to use money I don't have to splash out on things I can't afford, because either I'm going to be paying for it later, or the state will have to pick up where I failed. I just can't get my head around it, people seem to be so blasé about the whole thing and I feel like I'm the only one who seems to care about this.

The way I see it, university is just an investment. I'm going to have to spend £27K in tuition and three years of little income in order to get the qualifications I need, then another year's training, all of the time eating and drinking enough to stay alive, then I can make up for my investment and start making money back on it after which I can actually afford shit. Just because I've got £2K in the bank doesn't mean I should spend £2K, it means that if I do, I'm going to have -£2K. I don't have money, I can't afford to splash out.

Thing is, I'm not a very serious person and I love going out and stuff, which is why I'm working to build up funds so I can actually afford to do that. I certainly don't value money above friends and experiences, but that's with money that I have, if I'm in debt, I'm no longer independant. But the way some people are so liberal with money that isn't their's and the fact that they think that the state covering their 40K debt after they do their bullshit degree that they did 'just becuase that's what you do' is okay really annoys me- just strikes me as completely irresponsible.

Okay, that went on. I wouldn't mind knowing that I'm not the only one that has this opinion, everyone treats me like I'm mad when I say I don't want to use my debt to pay for 3 years accommodation 20mins from my house!

I know you might argue Oscar, Schurrle &gt; Barkley, and I'd agree with you right now, but I'd like to see Chelsea with a few young English players, and I believe Barkley will overtake those players as it stands.

I am making a baby quilt for a friend who has themed her nursery ""Dr. Who"", as I have yet to watch, (I swear I'm on it soon!) I'm not particularly well versed in what Whovian taste tends towards when it comes to baby quilts. 

I have a couple mock ups, and can't decide which one would be better received. I'd just ask her, but it's supposed to be a surprise. This is the my original idea, just a plain checked quilt with the baby's name in *fan made Circular Gallifreyan. (The circles on the mock up are just a mock up and the blues will match themselves better) [Gallifreyan](http://i.imgur.com/GRBKj8t)

But then this morning I had the bright idea to just do a bow tie.

I'm starting to lean more towards the bow tie, but I'm having hard time letting go of my original idea with the baby's name.

The questions I have are very general - I really do need to start from the beginning - and any knowledgeable advice would be gratefully received.

1. I'm 43, have a £20,000 deposit and a decent job at a highly respected  company - will my age have an effect on my ability to get a mortgage?

2. Given the info above, and that I earn £46,000 a year (no debt), what size of mortgage would be considered realistic - all other factors taken into consideration?

3. I've consistently paid approx £700/month for years in rent (Londoners will know the score) - will this be a guide to how much I'll be allowed to pay mortgage-wise?  

4. Am I better going to a bank, or is it worth going through a financial advisor?

Yes, I know I'm a Yank and that I have no say in what this page is about, but you gotta admit it's a champion idea.

I'm not sure what the most popular Missy theories are, but no one really talks about her being River. Moffat never gave us closure for her story, and I'd be surprised if he just left the timeline of his most important original character left open.

First time we saw River, she was ""saved"" into the Library. Her consciousness remained after her body died. Last we saw River, she was psychically linked to Clara in Name of the Doctor. The Doctor was surprised her ""echo"" hadn't faded after all that time, and she was clearly the River who lived in the library. The Doctor had stopped contacting her, left her to fade, and she was the only one remaining in the library.

Why was River still around? How long did she have alone? Maybe River  was eventually able to transcend her existence in the digital world that she lives in - maybe she became a sort of god.

I like the idea that Heaven is a digital world where people can be ""saved"". It explains how people who died appear there. Their consciousness is uploaded into heaven right before their material bodies are destroyed. Even if River isn't Missy, I think that Heaven/The Promised Land/the Nethersphere is most likely a sort of digital library of souls/consciousness. And if River is the one who has been there the longest, she would know how it works best. She could change its appearance, or her appearance. She's a god of a dimension that even the Doctor can't travel to - because it isn't anywhere in time or space.",false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,null,null,self,Does anyone still think Missy is River?,0,http://www.reddit.com/r/doctorwho/comments/2i0cdc/does_anyone_still_think_missy_is_river/

I've been away from the UK for three years as I was working abroad. I met my sweetheart of six years at uni - and we've been going strong since then.


I haven't seen her for over a year, and on my return shortly, I don't want to waste any time - I want to propose to her as soon as I get back!


Here's what I have in mind, and for this I would be eternally grateful if a fellow redditor could help me out to make this a success:


Option 1: at the time I'm supposed to arrive at Heathrow, someone (ideally someone who works at Heathrow - like security or police) calls my GF and tells her that there has been an incident on the flight and that I have been detained. She will already be at the arrivals section to meet me.


Here's where I could use your assistance: I'd need some sort of room at the airport where I'm meant to be detained. To put her mind at ease, and to avoid her calling anyone, the phone can be passed to me and I can tell her that everything's alright and all she needs to do is sign something and I can go home. I would also need someone to escort her to this room, where I'll be waiting to propose.


Option 2: Given the high security at the airport, I won't be surprised if I can't get a room inside the airport. If that happens, I will book the room/suite at Sofitel Hotel at Terminal 5. The same steps as above can be followed, but the person escorting her would really have to play the part of an authority figure and convince her that this is a matter of national security and therefore I am being questioned at the hotel and its ""advisable"" that she comes along.


If someone can help me make one of these plans work out, all I have to plan next is the flowers and the decorations :) I've already got a beautiful diamond ring made for her and I cant wait to go down on one knee and ask her to spend the rest of her life with me.",false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,null,null,self,Proposal: Help me make this a special day (at Heathrow),0,http://www.reddit.com/r/AskUK/comments/2i0h95/proposal_help_me_make_this_a_special_day_at/

Sold the PC to the first person to offer me £400 :P Everyone else was increasing by £5 etc but /u/cooolfoool offered me the full amount if I'd deliver, which I did tonight. Enjoy, and thanks for the interest. Who thought Reddit was good for selling PCs! :)


I don't see any no selling rules here so I'll give it a go ;)

This is a decent gaming computer, with nearly double the total RAM+VRAM as the ""next gen"" consoles (15GB vs 8GB), over double the GPU power of the Xbox One (960 shaders vs 2048) and almost double the GPU power of the PS4 (1280 shaders vs 2048).
Will play any current game on decent settings.

Looking for £400 OVNO. Can deliver in Bristol, possibly WSM as we go there every couple of weekends.

I went to register on the given day and was told that I was missing a document so could only end up partly registering. 

During registration day I began to question whether this was the right move for me and decided to tell them that I wasn't going to take up my place. 

After weeks of trying to withdraw, I officially got confirmation of such. They said in the email that I wouldn't get my deposit back and to make sure I email the finance department to make sure I don't owe any other fees. 

I did so and now, over two weeks later they have come back and said that: 

""I am afraid those students that wish to withdraw between Saturday 19th August 2014 and Saturday 15th November 2014 are liable to pay 50% of the course fees, according to the terms and conditions.""

This amounts to about 5 grand for a course that I didn't attend a single lecture of.

Not to mention that I just don't have anywhere near that kind of money but it seems so unfair.

I plan on making about 4 or 5 scripts, different stories in the same arc, with different Doctors. As you can see the first Doctor used is 3. I'm thinking of other stories that could use 9, 12, and maybe the War Doctor.

I have been speaking to Glynn from GQ Tobaccos and he reccomended the [Riverbank Bar and Kitchen.] (http://www.riverbanknotts.co.uk/index-z.shtml) Having had a look at the site, it looks totally perfect!! The terrace is absolutely gorgeous and it looks like a lovely place to smoke and chat.

Now, how does everyone feel about food? I was thinking perhaps we could go fo the [bar Sunday lunch menu] (http://www.riverbanknotts.co.uk/bar-sun-lunch.shtml) as it's not expensive but looks really nice. This would put us at a midday/afternoon timeframe. What does everyone think?

If you all like the look of this, I will get in touch with them to make sure they'd be ok with us doing this. I will probably make a facebook event page as quite a few non-redditors have expressed interest, I'll post a link when the restaurant has ok'd it.

[The terrace] (http://www.riverbanknotts.co.uk/terrace_pics.shtml) looks stunning.

Feel free to add any analysis on why you've picked your team, specific roles etc - go full on Football Manager if you like! Only restriction is that players should be fit and available for selection - You can use this as a guide: http://www.physioroom.com/news/english_premier_league/epl_injury_table.php

Thoughts? How would you get Liverpool FC out of their current funk?

Maybe if this is well received we'll do one each week. Post your team sheets and tactics and let's see who gets it right next week (or who we can blame if their team plays and we lose!).

The only way I could study is if I got UK citizenship because international tuition is incredibly expensive. 
Has anyone gone through a similar process? What was your outcome?
Or does anyone have some insider knowledge into UK citizenship?

Sure it's in terrible 80s video with about three pixels, but the meticulousness of the setup is just astonishing - you have to keep reminding yourself that it's just one voice acting all three parts, and not only that but since it's a vent dummy who is himself operating a vent dummy there are whole new layers of character leaking from one dummy to the next.

As a performer myself I am in complete awe of the ridiculous amount of skill and imagination in conceiving, devising, and executing this act, especially where he has to convincingly perform like a crap vent. Ray Alan was a *really* good vent btw.

Ray Alan and Lord Charles were a minor part of my childhood, and my respect for the act just grows with time.
