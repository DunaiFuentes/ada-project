Got up and went to the bank, sorted my rent out with a standing order.

Then got a haircut, my *god* hairdressers don't half talk some shit. The woman doing my hair looked far east Asian, probably Thai and she kept babbling to me all the way through in that typical Nottingham accent.
Then went to a get a coffee, considered going in starbucks but if I am going to have shit coffee, I'd rather support a small business than a tax evading multi billion pound company.

Then I was feeling a but hungry and went to the market, my nose guided me to this Carribean/West indes thingy stall. It smelled pretty amazing so I got some jerk chicken and ribs, with rice and ""peas"" (pretty sure those are beans, motherfucker)

There was middle aged guy doing the cooking and a woman about 19/20's serving people (It was pretty hard to not notice how fit she was, like seriously 9/10, the guy had a meat cleaver in his hand at the time and was giving me a dodgy look so I scarpered after paying)


Then I noticed some ""game pies"" on a stall near it and got some for in the week; Lamb and rosemary, Lamb and something else and venison. Then he said he'd throw in some others stuff for a tenner, got some rocky road, blueberries and a cherry pie aww yiss.

Then on my way home I saw this little old lady who looked about 100 struggling to get out of her front gate, a couple of people walked past and ignored her while I was waiting to cross which I thought was shitty of them. I asked if she needed any help and she introduced herself, her hands were pretty bad with arthritis and me being a soft bastard, I ended up talking to her about her pets/family for about 20 minutes and she offered to do me a cuppa but I told her to sit down on her bench in the patio whilst I did it and she had a cup of earl grey, decent stuff.

I said I'd drop by and see her again, I think I'm going to have to as her husbands been dead 30 odd years and she invited me over again like 5 times.

2. finding out that John Hurt was a doctor makes Mat Smith the 13th doctor.
BUT
in the episode where river ""kills"" the doctor he regenerates. I know it was a teselector, but still. So the doctor has extra regenerations. Where did he get them from? he doctor fought in the time war, as did the master (he was resurrected by the timelords as he was a valuable war force). They both ran away, but they still fought. After lore searching i found out that each serving timelord was issued with a new set of regenerations.
So how many lives does the doctor have? The eighth doctor served in the time war, so lets assume the new regenerations start from him, though they could also start from Hurt if he was the one who served, but for convenience lets say its the 8th. There's Hurt,  Eccleston and assuming that the ""half regeneration"" of tennant counts as a whole one, (from journey's end) there's also smith. This means that he has 8 regeneration left, so 9 more faces. However, i think that Hurt doctor actually comes from before the first doctor (Hartnell) as that is what caused him to choose the name doctor.

Welcome to *Picture of the Month*, a new feature for our subreddit where we showcase some Welsh photos and culture. Here's the plan:

Using the comments section below, submit your photos for Picture of the Month. The photo must be your own work and be your best or favourite representation of Wales and Welsh Culture.

The photo with the most upvotes by this time in two days (8pm Monday June 3rd) gets placed in our lovely sidebar (where you can see the Welsh flag now), along with a link to the full image and who submitted it, until it's time for next month's., in which it will be added to the list of Pictures of the Month to come in the upcoming wikilist shindig.

The submitter also gets **a month of reddit Gold**.

So let's get into the rules:

* Photo submissions must be the root comment in any given comment thread
* It must be **your** photo. No pilfering photography sites
* It must be 'appropriate'. No hi-res genitalia please.
* It must be **at least** 300x200 pixels, but the higher the resolution the better! I mean, within reason of course.
* Captions are welcome and encouraged, as they will be included in the 'about' section
* Please be kind and courteous of other users' submissions
* Use your upvotes wisely! The most upvoted submission will most probably be the one we choose, though this is at the discretion of the mods.
* Don't be nasty and downvote images just 'cause they're not yours. That's totally not cool
* This contest will have nothing to do with the upcoming header image photos, more info to come...
* If you suspect foul play feel free to [message the moderators!](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FWales)

That about sums it up. We look forward to seeing your submissions,

Good luck!

""But..... he played Jackson Lake in 'The Next Doctor', you fool!"" you say. Well my friends, there are ways around that. You see, DW has a way of of  recycling actors (see Karen Gillian and Colin Baker) but we could easily go with this theory too:

Tired of the ""John Smith"" persona, Twelve adopts a new ""human"" identity, Jackson Lake. For whatever reason (perhaps escaping The Hurt Doctor or Great Intelligence), Twelve is forced use his watch, and hide. During the transformation, the TARDIS malfunctions and throws The Doctor out of it's doors, with his watch still inside the TARDIS. Without a companion, The Doctor cannot return to his TARDIS, and the Jackson Lake identity takes over. Twelve has now been in human form for nearly ten years, and has since married and had a son. 

This is when the events of ""The Next Doctor"" occurs. The infostamps from the Cybermen make Jackson think he is the The Doctor, because he is in fact, The Doctor. His encounter with Ten and his later look into the TARDIS begins to ignite hidden memories.


Anyway, the actual story line is incomplete (obviously I don't write for DW) but at least it would explain the previous encounter with Ten and open the doors for another phenomenal actor to take the reigns of the TARDIS.",false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,null,null,self,"If Matt Smith leaves.....

There's no place to hide at LFC now - just look at Skrtel, Assaidi and Sahin (who looked classy but never showed any bite). Jack Robinson needs to step up too after Oldham, I think he might be at the under-21's, if so, he needs game time and more MoM awards like he had at Wolves.

Borini, Lucas, Coutinho, Sterling, Wisdom, Shelvey, Enrique, Henderson have all shown some fight this season and Ibe put himself about on debut. Add that to Gerrard, Carra (shame he's off), Suarez, and Pepe and you've got some serious fight on the pitch... not to mention, some world class talent...

That leaves Sturridge, Suso, Agger and mabe Downing who eiher get away with it due to a mix of their speed, class, reliability and by adding an extra dimension to the game. Sturridge and Suso are going to be very important next season, as will Agger. Downing may spend more time on the bench next season but I'm pretty sure he'll be here next season.

Overall, my feeling is that Rodgers is building a very tough and mentally strong team but in addition, he also demands a team of footballers.

So, long story short, my boyfriend got me a skydive for my birthday. I've never been in a plane, let alone been pushed out of one, so in order to comemorate such an awesome present, I decided to jump in aid of a charity. I chose a Sussex-based hospice &gt; http://www.stpeter-stjames.org.uk/ who provide pallitive care for terminally ill people. They recieve 18% funding and the rest they must find for themselves.
I decided to do it for this charity because my boyfriend's dad was looked after by them and did a fantastic job (though this was before I met my boyfriend), so it felt like a very pleasant way to say thank you to my boyfriend.

I don't know if i'm allowed to post a link (or even if im allowed to make a post of this nature - my apologies for any offence caused - that is not my aim!) however, if anyone would like to donate, I would be ever grateful - I am using the justgiving website, and if anyone is interested, can pm me for the link. It is a safe and secure method of donation and am more than willing to provide whatever verification is necessary by anyone who would like it. 

Thank you!",false,brighton,t5_2qprp,null,null,self,St Peter &amp; St James Hospice skydive fundraiser,6,http://www.reddit.com/r/brighton/comments/1fho8y/st_peter_st_james_hospice_skydive_fundraiser/

1. The Ninth Doctor is happy to carry or use weapons.
2. The Ninth Doctor is heavily condescending.
3. The Ninth Doctor isn’t as funny as the Tenth or Eleventh Doctors.

I thought these confusing. Each Doctor is different. One might be able to make an argument that Ten and Eleven are more similar to each other than Nine is to Eleven, but even so, that doesn’t make any difference.

So I made these rebuttals:

1. The Ninth Doctor is fresh out of the Last Great Time War. It took Rose’s presence to make him less prone to violent acts, especially after the events of Dalek. If the Ninth Doctor is happy to hold a weapon, it’s because his personality is in flux.
2. The First Doctor and /everyone/. The Third Doctor and /everyone/. The Fourth Doctor and /everyone/. The Sixth Doctor and Peri. The Seventh Doctor and Ace. Need I say more?
3. The Doctor isn’t meant to be a manic, talkative box constantly spewing out one-ilners in the way that some might argue Ten and Eleven were more than previous Doctors. In saying that, the Ninth Doctor certainly had his humorous moments — perhaps you just needed to have a Manx sense of humour? :P

In light of the fact that, well, something big is happening with the upcoming Christmas Special, it does everybody well to reflect that even their least favourite Doctors contributed more than one may think. If you have come to Doctor Who in the reign of Ten or Eleven, you may find it hard to believe that the Doctor could be unlike them.

So, what do you think about these arguments? Are they the sorts of things you’d say? Do you have any other points that are important?

After the news that broke today there has been a lot of people who have been pretty down on Steven Moffat. In my experience, he took a show that was really good and turned it into the best television I've ever seen. I can understand why people have been frustrated with season 7. For me, it's been the worst season since #1 (no offense to Eccleston but they just didn't have the budget or writing they needed). However, Moffat more than impressed in season 5 and 6, and I don't see why people feel the need to write him off as a bad show runner after one poor season. I can see where people are coming from when they say RTD developed characters better, but haven't we more than made up for that with Moffat in planned out story arcs and plain better writing for openers and finales? Obviously there is room for personal preference, and it's pretty clear I'm a fan of Moffat and his work with Doctor Who and Sherlock etc, but I don't really understand where all the hate is coming from. Anyways, he's not leaving yet so I have not been hit with a double whammy today, but I'm just looking for some clarity with the Moffat situation. Please prove me wrong, because although the show will move on without Smith (so sad), I just can't see myself continuing to love a show run by someone like Gatiss or Cross.

Sad yes, but who are we kidding...speculation is fun! 

If we lose our #7, most would think we are likely to be on the outside looking in on CL next season, but with a 45-60 transfer kitty, we could do some great things with the club. We would have no excuse for failing to snag Ericksen--unless he doesn't want to come, but that doesn't seem to be the case--and a few other great players to improve the starting 11. 

Coutinho and Ericksen would be a lethal attacking-mid combo. Sturridge, Borini and Aspas are a solid core of goalscorers and we would undoubtedly bring in another young talent who will contribute immediately (Benteke as an example). We'd have plenty of cash to improve the flanks and the backline, especially if we sell Downing. We have a sure thing in the beast that is Lucas Leiva and also competition within the squad with Allen, Suso, Hendo, Shelvey, Ibe and Sterling all chomping at the bit. Luis Alberto sounds promising and he looks class. At this point I personally am not concerned about goal creating or scoring and we seemingly have an improved unit.

Assuming we won't spend big on named striker and pep stays, my personal edits would be to add Benteke, Ericksen, Alberto and Diame. Papadopoulos and Alderweild would be huge and kolo already is. Leave out Atsu--we need better to replace Downing and we have the youth to fill that role (I liked the idea of Ben Arfa). Honestly with that side I think were 5th worse. While none of these names are marquee Reus or Higuain type signings (never happening), they are all prospects that seem to fit the new lfc transfer mould, are affordable and would add loads of talent. Opinions?

Don't get me wrong, I love el pistolero and I would prefer he simply matures, learns how to decline an interview and begins paying back the same loyalty that LFC have shown him. With that being said, his recent comments were very much a blindsided backhand of disrespect to club and supporters alike. As they say, no player is bigger than the club and it would seem time to cope the potential depature of LS. I've very much enjoyed watching Rodgers rebuild thus far and have no doubt the club would make some great moves with the dough.

For me, #10 has been my top doctor so far, but a part of me, and I'm sure it will increase as it draws closer, will miss #11 a lot. I think he will always be looked on fondly for his portrayal of the Doctor. 

This just bums me out to no extreme. 
Idc about the new doctor yet.
I'm upset, and confused why they would put out the news that he is staying all this time, only to retract that and put all whovians in a frenzy about it. 
Why? Why not just say that first? So we don't have false hope? 
I mean I know it's their show, money, and choices, and I have faith that someone will make #12 special also.

Every doctor to come along, has made it something special, unique, and personal. I don't think they would disappoint after all these years of fandom and whovianism. 
 I just feel sad, like my pilot jumped out of the plane they swore he would stay in. Weird analogy, I'm just in shock. 

I'm just sad because it has been circulating that he was confirmed to stay, and to now know he isn't, just seems off putting. 
Either way, there is a doctor somewhere in the universe, and they will find him/maybe her.

I am not saying that it is (or will be) John Hurt; it could be though. 

My reasoning for thinking that they have already been cast is this:

1.  When Moffat has previously spoken about the 50th Anniversary he has said it shouldn't be just about looking back; it should be about looking to the future.  Having the next doctor in the multi-doctor story would certainly do that.  
2.  Moffat has always been interested in doing things in interesting and new ways.  He said ages ago that he would only do a multi-doctor story (a full one; not a short mini one) if he was able to do something challenging and new with it. 
3.  Matt Smith has had a desire to leave in a way that you've never seen a doctor go before; granted he is leaving at Christmas - which has been the current theme for regenerations since Doctor Who's return in 2005.  However, although we got a partial taster for how this would work in ""The Next Doctor"" we have never seen a current Doctor meeting his future incarnation before his actual regeneration.  (We have seen the reverse).

*I know Dider is an easy choice because his heroics at the Alianz Areana, but I want to know who else*

For me, I will cheat and say two. One is a current player, that being David Luiz, and a former player being Andrey Shevchenko.

**David Luiz** because I like the transformation from CB to a splendid CDM with a free kick to be reckoned with. Also because he is Brazilian and he plays with such a swagger *yes I used the word swagger* and he is thoroughly an entertaining player to watch.

**Andrey Shevchenko** because although he didn't score as many goals as he did at Milan, I thought he was a great player that just didn't fit in like he could of. Injuries are a bitch too.

I do like ASIWYFA's album, but it does contain a few comedy moments, so I think they're better live than on album. That said, I haven't looked to see if they have any new albums out, oops. 

I liked that TWDY (an American band) chose an Irish support band too, rather than hauling one of the numerous, extremely talented post-rock bands over from the States with them. They were really grateful and extremely impressed with ASIWYFA's performance. Quite often you find that bands chose a completely different genre to support them for fear of being shown up (which, to an extent, they were), so it was brave and unselfish of them to pick this act. 

So. Support bands. Often disappointing, occasionally mind-blowing. 

Hit me with them.

Two potential solutions I have thought of is to have a weekly lurkers thread in which regulars are banned from making top level comments or replying to each other. The other, more drastic solution is to create a second pubreddit for general chatter, and for /r/TheRedLion to be kept on-topic to the thread title. Both have their advantages and drawbacks.

Stolen from /r/soccer, experimental361's graphing of each team in the top 5 domestic leagues in the worlds attacking effectiveness. It graphs our shots taken per game (x axis) versus our shots taken per goal scored (y axis) Now, boxed in the red square is us at the end of this season. I decided to graph 4 different scenarios from our season. I only counted PL games (not sure if the original covered European/Cup games as well). The first scenario is our performance from the first 19 league games. As you can see, with approximately 364 shots (19.16 per game) and 26 goals (1 goal per 14.0 shots) the graph concludes that we were considered ""Energetically wasteful"". The second scenario details our next 19 league games (19th-38th games). Here we took 375 shots (11 more than the first 19 games) but scored a remarkable 16 more goals (42 total). So we had 19.74 shots per game, and 1 goal for every 9.13 shots taken. The third scenario that I considered was the addition of our Brazilian, Coutinho. Since his first start (12 games), we took 236 shots (19.67 a game) and scored 27 goals (1 goal every 8.74 shots). The last scenario was when we started Coutinho and Sturridge (not counting Chelsea game where Daniel subbed in) together. There were 8 games where they started together with a total of 164 shots (20.50 shots per game!) and a total of 19 goals (1 goal for every 8.63 shots). 

So, we can see that our attacking effectiveness dramatically increased which can explain our improved results in the second half. Sturridge and Coutinho together create a lot of shot opportunities with the chance for a lot of goals. 

I did not count own goals in the data. Also, forgive the ghetto-ness of my graph additions. hahaha I'm very bored and lazy.

I have heard mixed responses, with some folk saying that you should not be listening to anything in order to be fully alert, and others saying headphones are fine. Similarly I have heard of people investing in bluetooth over ear headphones for their helmets, but it seems like you would have to crank them up quite a bit to be heard. I do not want to risk damaging my hearing. 

I only listen to either podcasts or audiobooks so feel like I get a good sense of my surroundings with plugs in as opposed to music which is a constant noise. Just like having the radio on in the car, I can dip into and out of the ""conversation"" as is needed.

I'd say I'm a leftist/central leaning authoritarian myself. I'm against sexism/racism etc and feel we should treat eachother as equals as we are all born the same (until you do something to disqualify yourself from having respect from your peers; Murder, abuse, rape, burgalry.

Going slightly off topic there, but basically a lot of the time now I am seeing people *constantly* moaning about their ""feelings"" well you know what I have to say to that? Fuck your feelings.

- I am wondering how ""secret"" are they going to try and make who the ""Next Doctor"" to be... with the uncertainty of what the exact role John Hurt is going to play in the 50th, I don't think we will know who the next Doctor will be before the 50th.... thus I don't think we will have the ""New Doctor"" on Stage in July.  Though It would be interesting if John Hurt is going to be part of the Panel, if so I don't think they'll give away his exact importance... but we very well could have Doctor 12 on stage, we just won't know it. 

- This is obviously monumental news, but I really don't want the Comic Con panel leading into the 50th anniversary of the show to be overshadowed by Matt's departure... Yes, it's going to be something that will be brought up, but I would like the focus of the Comic Con panel to be on the 50th..

I have a hunch that the ""surprise"" doctor we met in the season finale is maybe the doctor who ended the time war. In order to face his darkest secret, and all the blood on his hands, he is forced or volunteers, to go back and find a way of saving Gallifrey and ending the time war. In previous episodes, Ten didn't know what he was going to look like in his future regenerations, so it seems a little obvious that the surprise doctor is actually a hidden regeneration, making eleven actually twelve. 

Now. The time war being rewritten would completely rewrite the doctors life, essentially giving him back regenerations, cleaning his conscience, and giving him a new start. 

Thoughts? 

Edit: Coming back to add the thought that the Doctor may have been the one that created the Time War.

Stolen from /r/soccer, experimental361's graphing of each team in the top 5 domestic leagues in the worlds defensive effectiveness. It graphs our shots faced (or allowed) per game (x axis) versus our shots faced (or allowed)  per goal scored (y axis) Now, boxed in the red square is us at the end of this season. I decided to graph 6 different scenarios from our season. I only counted PL games (not sure if the original covered European/Cup games as well). The first scenario is our performance from the first 19 league games. As you can see, we faced 222 shots (11.68 shots per game) and allowed 25 goals (1 goal for every 8.88 shots), the graph concludes that our defense was  considered to be ""Avoiding the issue"". The second scenario details our next 19 league games (19th-38th games). Here we see that we faced 211 shots (11.01 shots per game) but only allowed 17 goals (1 goal for every 12.4 shots). Our second half of the season, defensively, was much, much better than our first half. Was it Lucas? Was it the switch from Skrtel to Carragher?   

Lucas started 23 fixtures for us (I did not count the game against ManCity where he was subbed off after 5 minutes) this season in the league. In those 23 fixtures, our team faced 246 shots (10.69 shots per game) and allowed 24 goals (1 goal every 10.25 shots). In the 15 fixtures where he did not start, we faced 187 shots (12.46 shots per game) and allowed 18 goals (1 goal every 10.38 shots). The data shows that while the defense allowed more shots per goal without Lucas, the number of shots allowed total was dramatically reduced with Lucas starting. 

Now, the next two scenarios cover a very controversial topic, the battle between Skrtel and Carragher. Now, Skrtel started 21 of our first 22 league fixtures (23 starts total) and Carragher started the last 14 of 15 fixtures (16 fixtures total). Note that Carragher and Skrtel started together in the last game of the season. WIth Skrtel starting at CB, we faced 273 shots (11.87 shots a game) and allowed 29 goals (1 goal for every 9.41 shots). According to the graph, with Skrtel starting, we start to head closer to the ""Good but overworked"" section of the graph, as well as closer to the ""pushover"" section. With Carragher in our starting line-up, we faced a total of 171 shots (10.68 shots per game) and allowed only 13 goals (1 goal for every 13.1 shots). With Carragher starting in 16 of our fixtures, according to the graph, our defense was performing at a very high level, very much so in the ""formidable"" section. 

Now, this is not saying that Carragher is a better player than Skrtel, or that he was playing much, much better. There are other variables we must consider in these defensive stats such as: Lucas entering the squad and regaining form, better attacking effectiveness (which we saw is true), or maybe Agger playing better. It can be seen that our defense (and offense) were much better in the second half of the season, which are definite signs of improvement and progress. 

I did not count own goals in the data. Also, forgive the ghetto-ness of my graph additions. hahaha I'm very bored and lazy.

EDIT: If there's any more statistical based questions you might want answers to, send me a PM or let me know, and I'll try my best to find an answer out. It's summer time, I have nothing to do for a few more weeks.

Coentrao/Shaw (10m)
Bernard (kid looks brilliant from the ScoutNationHD vid, 5-10m?)

I'm starting to feel optimistic about next season. I think it's down to the number of QPR players who have come out and said there was a serious problem in the squad. It's what we could all see, but during the season it's difficult for players to admit the issues for fear of making things worse.

Hill, Fabio, Green, Derry, Jennas and Townsend have all said the same, there were serious splits in the team, which were so bad even Harry couldn't fix them.

Everyone now sees the same issues and I hope will work together to fix them.

In a few weeks the transfer  window will open, Harry and the board will have had enough time to sort out a plan. The experience of last summer and the 2012/13 season should have given the board a very harsh initiation into football management, there are no short-cuts.

I expect a majority of last season's players to stay at the club. We desperately need 2 strikers; Johnson and Zamora will be fortunate to play even most games and with up to 3 games a week in the CL it's likely they'll be out injured before we are 2 months into the campaign.
I'd love to see D J Campbell given a chance to play next season, the crowd will adore him and he has shown how effective he can be in the Championship. Let's hope Harry takes punt.


Derry and possibly even Hill are coming towards the end of their football careers, it's time to look for new blood. I'd favor a slow transition, preferably bringing in some of the QPR youth and other players who have the potential of a long stay at the club.


Everyone at QPR and all QPR fans agree on what caused the issues last season, let's hope the board and Harry don't look for  more short-term, quick fixes. Instead I'd like to see QPR build a solid backbone in the team that will provide opportunities to bring in youth. Then, perhaps, we can again see a QPR we are proud of.",false,superhoops,t5_2swvo,null,null,self,Why I'm optimistic about QPR's chances next season...,4,http://www.reddit.com/r/superhoops/comments/1fiwre/why_im_optimistic_about_qprs_chances_next_season/

Point is with him, he is not fit to call himself The Doctor so I'm just going to call him Evil Doctor for these purposes.

Anyways, 11 and Clara meet Evil Doctor and all all hell breaks loose in the Doctors time stream, which in trying to defeat the Evil Doctor, 11 and Clara run into 10 and Rose (we know they're in the 50th somewhere).  The 4 team up to try to thwart Evil Doctor and all sorts of wibbly wobbly, timey wimey stuff happens which leads us into the Christmas special.  They defeat Evil Doctor, but not before something happens to the Doctor, causing him to regenerate.  Now keep in mind he's still messing around in his own time-stream so this causes things to go a little haywire and 11 regenerates but to a previous form and then all of the sudden, Tennant is back!

Any thoughts? This all seems plausible to me and some friends plus tons of fans would love to see Tennant again

I thought I'd make a new thread to get some discussion going about this idea and see who would be willing to participate and how we could go about doing it.

Some thoughts so far:

* The game in general would require honesty, so that you don't google and blatantly cheat. It's only for a bit of fun anyway, not like we can offer a free crate or anything so I'm hoping it shouldn't be too big of a problem.
* Spoiler tags. We could use this to keep discussion in groups (otherwise communicating over PM individually would be a mare) and again would require honest from others not to cheat. Suppose it's like overhearing someone else's answer at the pub!
* Use contest mode: So that threads need to be expanded and thus less opportunity for people to 'accidentally' cheat. The top level post could just be the group name to make it easy for people to identify where they're chatting.
* IRC or tinychat rooms, maybe keep them as simple as group 1, group 2, etc so they can be reused in the future. Would require effort to set up and organise, but I do think conversation flow is much better in this style than in a reddit thread. Alternatively we could have a skype thread (as long as people have a skypeid they don't mind sharing).

So, long story short, my boyfriend got me a skydive for my birthday. I've never been in a plane, let alone been pushed out of one, so in order to comemorate such an awesome present, I decided to jump in aid of a charity. I chose a Sussex-based hospice &gt; http://www.stpeter-stjames.org.uk/ who provide pallitive care for terminally ill people. They recieve 18% funding and the rest they must find for themselves. I decided to do it for this charity because my boyfriend's dad was looked after by them and did a fantastic job (though this was before I met my boyfriend), so it felt like a very pleasant way to say thank you to my boyfriend.
I don't know if i'm allowed to post a link (or even if im allowed to make a post of this nature - my apologies for any offence caused - that is not my aim!) however, if anyone would like to donate, I would be ever grateful - I am using the justgiving website, and if anyone is interested, can pm me for the link.

8 of us are popping over for stag, nerds not rowdy, on the weekend of the 15th. We already have Man of Steel booked and a supernatural event on the sat night.

We have a few hours to kill on Fri evening and 3 hours on sat evening. Was looking at the mini golf but didn't know what it was like.
I have come to this fine subreddit to see if anyone has any ideas please?

Thank you in advance.

On 15 June, 2013, Global Reddit Meetup Day is coming to Liverpool. Will you be part of it?

With eleven meetups already over the last two years, our twelfth meetup will coincide with [Global Reddit Meetup Day](http://blog.reddit.com/2013/05/get-ready-for-global-reddit-meetup-day.html). We're hoping to make this one of the biggest meetups we've ever had.

We'll be waiting at the John Lennon statue from 7pm until around 7:20pm. After that, check back on this post for updates on where we'll be throughout the evening.

If you've not been to one yet, why not! Each meetup has brought new people out and that's what the meetups are all about - Meeting new local people. And booze. Come and have a drink with us.

Strictly over 18 only.

But, as I was thinking about all this, I realized something that I think will make a lot of people here feel at least a little bit better about Matt being free to do other projects now...

I saw Matt's movie Christopher and His Kind not too long ago, and for those of you that are not familiar with it here's the IMDB link for the movie: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1651062/

Now a quick glance through the Trivia section of this movie will reveal a very *interesting* fact: Despite the fact that Matt Smith has done it before in the movie Womb (pre DW obviously), the BBC explicitly forbade the director of Christopher and His Kind from showing Matt's bare bottom in the film because the BBC wanted to ""protect their property"" and not have the star of one of their biggest family friendly shows whip out everything in a movie. But, now with the recent news, guess what the BBC can't tell Matt or his directors to do after this year? 

**JACK FUCKING SHIT** that's what!

So after 11 regenerates this year Matt Smith can show his ass in anything he wants to, hell, he might even pull an Ewan McGregor and go full frontal in the future, who knows! What is known is that the BBC won't be able to do anything about it! And going by what he's done in the past, he is *highly* likely to do it again. 

So when you get depressed about Matt Smith leaving Doctor Who, just think about what his future projects might bring ;)

I think Jose had, had enough with the press/ownership in Madrid &amp; decided it was his last year. He let Roman know this &amp; they came to an agreement. It was just a matter of time before Di Matteo got the axe &amp; Roman filled his spot with someone competent yet hated by the fans to mask the fact that this was all about Di Matteo being forgotten about by the time Jose came to town. Roberto never stood a chance once Jose made his decision. Imagine if we had managed to win the Europa League &amp; finish 3rd with Di Matteo &amp; we were faced with Roman firing him for Jose. Roman wasn't going to let that happen. 

I don't doubt that Jose is a better match than Di Matteo going forward, but amid our excitement this week, don't forget that Roberto got fucked hard in November to make it happen.

**Former British artillery patrol boat on the run**

""The patrol boat Defender, with English flag, which has been remanded in the port of Santa Cruz in Tenerife since the month of April for sailing without legal documentation, fled yesterday from the Tenerife port. The vessel had been held since April when it arrived at the port of Los Cristianos with technical problems.

During the inspections carried out on the boat, the authorities detected numerous irregularities relating to the documents of the crew and safety at sea, and decided to hold back the ship. The vessel was escorted by the Spanish navy patrol boat Tornado to Tenerife's Santa Cruz port, where it remained until where it fled last night. The Defender was built in 1977 in the Lowestoft shipyard in the south of England, and served from that date. Today, after belonging for a time to the Navy of the Kingdom of Oman, it returned to sail under the British flag and is owned by a former officer of the Royal Navy.

The Defender provides support and protection to the oil rigs located in the gold of Guinea against pirate attacks. To this aim, it has two 20mm and 40mm cannons with gun-mounts. For the moment the Canary Islands' Government Office did not want to make judgements on the flight of the Defender.""",false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,null,null,self,Heavily armed former Royal Navy officer in ex-Navy boat on the run from Tenerife port,25,http://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/1fkjwg/heavily_armed_former_royal_navy_officer_in_exnavy/

I am currently searching for a job as an iOS developer, i'm in a good position where i'm not in desperate need to find a job at the moment. I'm lucky enough to have had 2 job interviews in the past week and it's going well.

Last week I got a call from a recruiter saying one company that could be interested in me would like a bit more information, which is fair enough. But it turns out this information is they want to know my GCSE grades. Having got a degree in Computer Science I personally find this information totally irrelevant to the position and have refused to give this information up.

Am I being petty here? I know I don;t have to disclose anything I don't want to. I liken giving this information up to putting on my CV that I did some babysitting when I was 13, I have much more relevant information to put on it now that this information counts for nothing.

EDIT: I have sent the recruiter my grades. I don't agree with it but not submitting them would definitely rule me out. It's not that I did badly in my GCSE's it's just 7-8 years ago now (I didn't get anything below a B). For any of those asking I have around 3 years industry experience developing for mobile platforms so i'm not necessarily applying for Entry Level positions and there seems to be a lack of developers in this field at the moment so I can afford to be a bit picky.

* Injuring a French Royalist Officer in a duel. (he was unharmed),

* Captured, burned  or drove ashore 53 ships,

* Capturing a French fortress in Spain, delaying an entire army by a month,

* Orchestrated the Battle of the Basque Roads, [here, wiki](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_the_Basque_Roads),

* Helped liberate Chile and Peru from the Spanish, in which he captured the City of Valdivia with 2 ships and 300 men. The city was incredibly well defended with ~1500 men and 100 cannon.

* He was friends with Brunel and was an accomplished engineer, co-holding the patent for the [Tunnelling shield](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tunneling_shield).

He was an incredible British hero, well versed in kicking French and Spanish arse. Worthy of praise across all this fine land.

This CD set is unique in containing a map of Cathay (China) as represented during the period of the Doctor's visit to China, and also explaining historical inaccuracies. Further, the first disc in the set contains data as well as audio; the data includes MP3 files of the soundtracks without additional narration (which is provided on the CDs by William Russell, filling in details when action was mostly visual), PDF files of the narration scripts, and computer wallpaper versions of the aforementioned map of Cathay.

What are they running from?  And what would the Doctor be running from ALL OF HIS LIFE?

What if John Hurt's Doctor is a future Doctor, right before his death.  What if he (the man himself, before the title of the ""Doctor"") saw his future and saw that he would basically become the worst being that ever lived by seeing that he does something horrible in his future.  Not the ""valeyard,"" but legitimately him.

So what does he do?  He takes on the name of the ""Doctor"" and never reveals his true name.  Because in his mind, his true name belongs to the future version of himself that he never wants to be.  And then he runs by stealing a TARDIS in the hopes that by saving people and helping them as the ""Doctor"", he will ultimately avoid this fixed point in his own timeline.

Woke up at 5.30am, replied to a message from /u/PeterSutcliffe who was also awake, decided not to go back to sleep because I'd then just feel shit and groggy all day. Uploaded an album for /u/satanspanties (did ya get it?).

Managed not to hurt myself or walk into anything before leaving the flat. Have stocked up on fresh coffee, so that's all good, no more instant shite thanking you. 

Could not fit into a gorgeous dress a friend gave me. Hips too bloody big. But I've decided I bloody well will before the end of July if it KILLS me. 

Listened to a pretty good mixtape from someone on last.fm on the way in. Rediscovered that I have the music taste of an EMO teenager. Ha.

My surrogate mum at work needed intricate details about my weekend, what's happening with x fella, y fella, and I don't think we even got around to z fella. She bought a kettle in as we're both water/limescale snobs and a selection of green teas, asked me what I'm going to get tonight for lunch tomorrow (I'm spending a tenner a day on work food) and generally mothered me to pieces. Really, I've never had this in my life, so it's quite sweet. We then had a long discussion about my estranged sister, and came to the conclusion that I dislike her so much because she’s basically a younger version of me when I was still an impossible twat (except that she’s four years older). I made the mistake of revealing that I'd drunk 6 litres of milk within 5 days last week, and apparently this is a BAD THING, although she couldn't really tell me why. ‘You must get your bloods done dear.’  

Had a long chat with another work friend about her crazy, controlling ex who has sexual tendencies bordering on the, well, the wtf really (he gets his current gf to eat from a dog bowl whilst tied up).  Always nice to know there are people out there who make us look normal huh? 

Bought my lunch in M&amp;S. Warning: don't go to M&amp;S on a Monday lunchtime. Not only is it full of impossible people but there are nipples on display that really should not be. **Important warning, stay away from their fish &amp; chips crisps: they're basically pilchard and vinegar.**

The boss returned from holiday in quite a mellow mood. So she didn't bat an eyelid at the massive mess I'd made of a peace of work. Ahem.

Found another job in the real world to apply for. $$$$$$. Bring it. 

My fingers hurt. Lots of them. Like they've been slammed in doors. Maybe I need to stay away from the keyboard/mouse in the evenings this week. 

And now I'm going to watch Madmen and Carrie (1976, none of your shite remakes, tyvm), and loathingly handwash a load of work jackets because I'm too poor to spend a fortune at the dry cleaners at the moment. 

Sorry, I sent you to sleep? Oh well, you probably need a nap.

I understand that you have to look at texts and find quotes that fit the question, and sometimes highlight the devices used, like alliteration, compound sentences etc.

In History, which I had today, the mark schemes were helpful as they gave a guide to what you had to write to answer the question, i.e. for a 7 mark question, you had to give two developed explanations to get full marks. There isn't anything like this in English Language, and the MS only has answers that could be written by someone, but don't indicate how many points you should write, or if they should be developed or not. For example, in an 8 mark question, should I also include the literary devices used, even if I'm not asked?

Another thing is the section B part, where you have to write about a bad experience or something like that. Is there any guide for this either?

TL;DR: I know how to answer the questions, but I don't know how much I should put (for say, an 8 mark question).

Earlier this year, we got an email from the club asking if we'd be interested in playing at an Supporters Club tournament at Anfield. Of course we all said yes and they put on a tournament with over 36 official international supporters clubs from around the world. The broke it up to three sessions with 12 teams each. LFCNY played in the last session which put is in the group with the likes of:

-Dubai Reds
-Iceland
-Poland
-Belgium (Flemish)
-Vancouver
-Alsin
-Leicestershire
-Wexford
-South Dublin
-Finland
-Boston

Great day all around and we ended up making it to the final where we beat the Polish Reds 3-2. Everyone from the clubs, supporters, LFC staff were fantastic. Big mention to the Polish Reds were just brilliant and some of the nicest guys around. The club did this without asking for any money or special mention and was great for the club to get in contact with supporters. Newcastle did something like this, but you had to pay to do it. Will they have this next year? Not sure, but I wouldn't be surprised. If you guys want a shot at doing this, I advise you to join up with your closest officially recognized LFC supporters club and have them submit interest when the club puts out an email next year for interest. Obviously the bigger supporters club you join, the better shot you have.

Best of luck and keep that dream alive. Never in a million years did I think this would happen. Still smiling thinking about it.

I would like some help, to see if this show is for me. 

From what I've seen of pre-2005 Who, and from what some people have told me, the show is pretty campy. Cheesy special effects, that give me a ""so bad it's good"" vibe. I'm not a fan of ""so bad it's good"".

My question is, does New Who (2005 onwards) take itself more seriously? I don't mean Breaking Bad serious, I know this show has comedy, but things aren't cheesy and campy are they? That would be a real dealbreaker for me.

Chelsea TV this evening (Monday) broadcast the first interview with Jose Mourinho after he was appointed manager earlier in the day.
Among the many subjects discussed were his emotions on returning, his aims, his development as a manager, his staff and the Chelsea squad and supporters.
Here is the Chelsea TV interview in full:
Welcome back, how are you?
I’m very happy. I had to prepare myself not to be too emotional for my arrival at the club but obviously I’m very happy.
How big a decision was it for you? It’s not common for managers to go back.
It was an easy decision. I met the boss, the owner, and I think within five minutes after some short and pragmatic questions we decided straight away. I asked the boss do you want me back, and the boss asked me do you want to come back, and in a couple of minutes the decision was made.
It worked out well in a way for both parties before. While you left and did what you wanted to do, Chelsea have continued to win things and built on what you did. 
It was a difficult moment, September 2007, because I love it here and I have a big connection with the club, and also for the club it wasn’t easy. But if you analyse it in a cool way, emotions apart, it was fantastic because my career after that, I had everything I was aiming for in my career. I wanted to win the grand slam, to win in England, Spain and Italy. I did it. I got all the trophies in three countries. I got my second Champions League too.
I enjoy being in different countries, in different football cultures, and I think it’s important for my evolution as a manager and a football coach, and Chelsea Football Club got important trophies after that and had important moments in the history of the club. Now we are back together and we are getting together at a great moment for us both, so I think we are ready to marry again and be happy and successful.
What’s the plan now?
The plan is always the same, evolution and to establish the club at the highest possible level. I left Chelsea in 2007, since then I’ve spoken about the club many times, especially in my privacy. I remember the day we went to the United States in 2004 pre-season. We had open training sessions with only a couple of kids watching the sessions, nobody was following the team. It was the beginning of Roman and his second season I suppose was the beginning of Chelsea. After that Chelsea started winning the Premier League, for the first time and then the second time, and after that when we went back to the United States we found a completely different situation around the club.
I can imagine now especially after the Champions League, that was the highest point of the club’s history, that this is now a bigger club. The social mass around the club is much bigger.
I am the same, physically the same, but every day you have to think about yourself, especially the manager, and about the evolution. I have the same nature but I’m much more mature with a different approach to things, I’m more ready to be in a club and stay for a long time.
Normally you haven’t spent a lot more than about three years with a club so you are saying this is longer-term building?
I hope so. When you look at the profile of the Chelsea squad I think it’s what they need at this time. If you look from my time, there are around four or five boys and these are the older ones - very important for this football club and very important for the balance of the squad, but it’s a young squad with a lot of talent and I think they need stability to reach a high point of their evolution and for their careers. They need stability, stability I hope I can give them and between me, the owner and of course the club, we have no doubts about what we want to do and the approach we want to have. I’m very confident I can help the team and help the boys to develop.
I feel myself not just as the Chelsea manager, because this is the first time in my career that I’ve arrived at a club that I already love. Normally I love the club a couple of years after I am there. Of course I go to a club, I wear the shirt and I feel the shirt with the crest and I give everything I have to do it, but this is the first time where I love it already. To be at the same time a Chelsea fan and a Chelsea manager is a new feeling for me and it’s a fantastic feeling.
You have a head start with the fans as you are already popular.
I know I am and I know at this football club there is a culture for the fans to be loyal to somebody who gave. When I watch a Chelsea match on TV and I see, for example, a banner which says Didier Drogba, that’s fantastic, and it makes Chelsea a special club.
I know they have a special feeling for me. I played against Chelsea with Inter and it was difficult because I was feeling it wasn’t a normal situation for me, and I think the people in the stands felt the same as me, so I belong to them and they belong to me. 

I think they know my nature, and they know I’m not coming here to sleep on what I did in the past and be comfortable just because we have a great feeling and we have a great relationship. Probably the first day I put my foot in Stamford Bridge again they will sing my name, but I’m not that kind of person and professional. I’m very demanding of myself. I need of course their support but I want to start from ground zero, I need to work hard again and build a different team from the team I built in the past. I want to give everything I can to the club, to the owner and to the fans, forgetting a little bit that I was a champion here. I want to have that pressure on myself like it is the first time I am here and I have to work hard to make sure they have a reason to be happy with me.
 

 
In the past six years you won the treble with Inter and had one incredible season in the league with Real Madrid. You say you are more mature now, how do you assess your development since you’ve been away from us?
Italy was something I wanted very, very much to do. Italian football is for sure the most tactical one, very difficult, especially if you are a team that wants to win, competing against teams that don’t want to lose. It was a big challenge for me.
I arrived in a club where there was an atmosphere of frustration because they couldn’t succeed in the Champions League and we got that trophy and for the first time in Italian football the treble. It helps me a lot to be more cultural. After Portugal and England I went to football with a different perspective. It was a big challenge for me, I had to challenge myself a lot and to study a lot. I think I became a better manager living in Inter.
I went to Madrid because I wanted to try to do the grand slam, the three most important championships in the world, and also because twice I had the chance to go to Real before, and I never did it because I decided to stay at Chelsea. The last one was the day after we won the FA Cup final at Wembley, and I thought “no way, I am going to stay”. The third time I wanted to go, I wanted another culture and another club with a worldwide dimension in terms of social approach and it was a fantastic experience for me. I think it was really important to get it in this period I call the last step of my formation as a manager. I’ve just turned 50 now and just finished my lap around European football. This experience in Madrid was fantastic because culturally it was hard, it was difficult. Portuguese and Spanish, and Spanish and Portuguese, and Real Madrid, a special club in a season where they have elections for the presidency, lots of politics around.
Last year we beat the record and got 100 points and 121 goals. This season everybody was focused on the Champions League. We reached the semi-finals and we all know, especially in this club, that semi-finals are a critical moment where you need that click to do it.

In my head I imagine a 7 day drip, a big loop down from the UK, into Germany, Austria, Switzerland and back up through France.

I'm travelling as light as possible because what is the point in riding a bike if you cover it with tonnes of gear. One backpack and one dry bag at the very most.

Stopping at B&amp;B's along the way.

No idea where I'm heading, or when. Any tips/ideas?

At the moment:

- New tires
- New brake pads
- Oil change
- Waterproofs in bag
- Basics (a towel, toothbrush, etc)
- Clear visor
- Can of chain lube
- Alarmed disc lock
- Maps (downloaded on phone so not using mobile data)
- Check I'm insured (all clear)

I've fitted a USB port on my bike so I'll always have phone battery and a way to charge the helmet cam.

What do you recommend?

How should I cross the channel?

Should I avoid any countries?

Do I need a GB sticker on my bike?

Are there any strict regulations I'd need to modify the bike to meet?

I'm glad that Jose is coming back. And even though he has acknowledged we don't have to spend millions I fear lots of things.
In 2004/2005 the amount of leeching that took place. Poor Arnesen with his failed project and the flurry of  players (mostly Portuguese) that were hyped for sale as if they were wares  in a steamy Turkish Bazaar. The tabloids and agents in collusion as always. In Portugal, selling players is now like a national export, an institution . Coentrao for 30 million just comes to mind.

 I understand that we were rebuilding at that time, but I think its only natural to suspect the return of shady agents and disgruntled players. I can't find the article, but I remember reading somewhere that Mendes and other people casually hanged out on Roman's yacht, sounded out transfer targets relatives over expensive dinners and even mingled with Rupert Murdoch at some point. I think both Mourinho and Abramovic have learnt from their mistakes and are now looking to be more cautious about transfer dealings.We still mistrust Emenalo but the increase in value of his acquisitions like Lukaku, Courtois and KDB is undeniable. I think Mou might have made some concessions about the media and agents in general before agreeing to come back. 

He also has a more sullen tone, 

*""With the departure of Ferguson, I realise that being a relatively young coach at the top has made me feel more responsible,"" Mourinho said in an interview with Jornal de Noticias. ""I have been at the top of my profession for over ten years. I feel more and more responsible. The younger coaches expect it of me and I cannot disappoint.""*

*""Values have been lost. Education and professionalism are becoming worse and worse. It is a problem in current society and football in particular - working as groups, not individually. I believe success depends on objectives being reached by a group, who are able to identify, establish and fight for those goals.""*


*""Twenty titles in all the countries I have coached in is a lot. I have learned that, no matter what, I want to win more times, but I've accepted that losing is part of my professional life,""* he said.

*""I like to open and close my coaching cycles without talking about the downsides. I'll try not to speak to the Spanish media because of this.""*

Apart from the agent issue I'm certain some of the players would take the transition hard. Mourinho is one of the best at creating a motivated coterie but that makes it more hurtful to be an outcast in his team. I'm interested in how he handles subtle/meek players like Oscar, and I hope he doesn't turn into what Kaka is now, a ghost of what might have been. I hope Oscar matures into a determined maestro like Sneijder  under Mourinho, when he could seize every game at the moment. We saw a glimpse of that Oscar against Juventus. I also hope Hazard becomes as goal hungry as Cristiano Ronaldo is. **So what are your hopes for next season?**",false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,null,null,default,What are your hopes for next season?,0,http://www.reddit.com/r/chelseafc/comments/1flxl2/what_are_your_hopes_for_next_season/

So I originally started watching Who per suggestion of my dad (he loves sharing shows, comics, movies and such like this with me), beginning with Eleven and little Amelia Pond and I absolutely loved it. What amazing plots! This show was completely different from anything I'd seen.

Flash-forward to Christmas this year and having watched all of Eleven so far I began again with Nine, wanting to know more about the Doctor's origins, other companions, and whatnot. Taking a month or two break for good 'ole college work, I continued watching but at a leisurely pace. This past week however I totally submerged myself and just an hour or two ago I finished Tennant's run...

I've been crying since. But WOW what an amazing show. I am so glad I decided to watch Tennant's work. Rose, Martha, Donna, EVERYONE OF THEM! I adored it. Before viewing the rest I believed Matt to be my one and only Doctor. I had seen the regeneration by Ten before when starting with Eleven; so I thought I wouldn't cry because I loved Eleven, Amy, Rory and his story already. I thought he was the only Doctor I wanted. Now I just appreciate it all :) AND now I almost feel like a time lord because I've seen the future, seen the past and am just restarting again with the world of Eleven but with a new perspective.

No, the point of this post is rather to discuss how we each believe that the TARDIS bends the very fabric of space and time. As a disclaimer I should mention that I will not go about spouting anything I write here as fact.   But rather, this is how I believe that the TARDIS functions within the realm called the Whoniverse. (A universe parallel to our own in which the doctor exists.) Also there should be a certain level of suspension of disbelief that you should have with all things ScFi related. After you have read and examined my theory on the TARDIS, please feel free to comment on it and to provide your own theories as to how it works. As such, let us begin:

*******

It should first be mentioned that the TARDIS itself is not a box. Or rather it is not just a box.  In fact, the box part itself is irrelevant to the whole.  It is merely the most convenient form to allow the travel of both space and time. Within my theory, it is possible to use any box whatsoever. (As long as that box exists in the Whoniverse that is) The box is perfect for preventing the person operating the device from seeing in or out of the ship as a whole unless the door is open. And only the person opening the door can know for sure where the door may lead.  It can be said that the thing that powers the TARDIS is imagination itself.  Infinite space within a small box.  It may not be time lord technology that drives it, but rather a time lords mentality. The ability to see time and space in flux. Able to pass through it with ease, albeit there are some restrictions as to prevent the universe from collapsing in on itself. For that you need imagination.  A great one at that too.  For with a great imagination you can have anything you want within a small blue box. 

For this theory you will need to understand a bit about quantum mechanics to understand the theory, not a lot mind you, but you must at least be familiar with the concept of ""Schrodinger's cat."" For those uncertain of the concept it is as follows.  There is a cat and a box. The cat is placed in the box and the box is sealed. The box itself contains a deadly poison that when released will kill the cat. However, the release of the poison happens at random. It could happen almost instantly, or it may never happen. And there is no signal. The only way to know if the cat is alive or dead is to open the box. At this point you have essentially created two different universes within that box. One where the cat is dead. And one where the cat is alive.  And only when the box is opened will the two universes collapse on one another to reveal which of the two universes holds true and which is false and you will know that the cat is either dead or alive. I am sure by now, many of you have seen the parallel that I am drawing from this experiment.  However, there is one key difference between the experiment and the TARDIS.  And that is that the contents of the TARDIS are unknown.  Therefore there are infinitely many universes inside the little blue box.

This is the crux of my hypothesis that cannot be tested as it requires an imagination far greater than my own. The blue police box contains within it an infinite amount of universes. And when the door is opened, the universes all collapse on themselves into the universe that the time lord that opened the door. This can be show all throughout the show, both the old and new serials, when the TARDIS itself seems to regenerate whenever it receives massive damage. The time lord simply reimagines how the universe within the box should look. The same can be said for when exiting the TARDIS. However, it is not as simple as just imagining a universe on the other side of the door.  If that was the case then anyone would be able to do it.  But that is what makes the time lords so powerful.  They not only can imagine the universe that would fit their needs, but they can will that universe into existence, sometimes subconsciously which can be seen when the TARDIS takes the Doctor away from his intended destination. So there you have it.  The TARDIS itself cannot exist without a time lord to run it.  If anyone else was able to go inside (without previously seeing the inside of it) they would only see the hollow inside of the call box.

Now you might be asking yourself how the TARDIS is able to materialize in and out of time and space like it was never there, and to that I say that it never really was there, and always was there at the same time. The gateway that is formed is created by the TARDIS when exiting the box.  But the box never really is there, just the doorway.  Theoretically, a time lord could use any doorway as a means of transportation (Though they may not have advanced that far yet) but the TARDIS itself serves as an excellent means of concealing total knowledge of the inside to any one outside the box and thus is able to maintain the illusion that it is bigger on the inside. The main criteria for the travel of space and time would then come down to only needing a two things.  A time lord who doesnt know what is on the other side of a door,(Or someone of equal knowledge of the space and time continuum) and a door that one cannot know what is on the other side of it unless the door is opened.  And that the universe inside the blue box itself is nothing more than a pocket universe separate from the Whoniverse, but still connected to it. Essentially a middleman, only used as a means of making the time lord believe enough that they have moved through both time and space so that the door now holds infinitely many universes on the outside now. And only when the door is opened will they actually be in a different time and place from where they first started. This can be seen when River Song is able to operate the TARDIS without making the parking break noise as it really isnt needed in the first place and only the thing needed is that the time lord does not know for certain what is on the other side of that door. And in that instance, the Doctor did not know what was on the other side of that door.

The real power of the TARDIS comes not from the box itself or even from the technology that supposedly makes it up, but rather the user is where the true power comes from. So even though the box itself seems infinitely powerful, it is irrelevant as any time lord can go into any door in which the other side is unknown and end up in a different time and place.

I think Moffatt put that in to give watchers the knowledge that John Hurt was prevalent during the time between 8 and 9. Let me hear your opinions and get some feedback. 


As for the second theory, we know that the Doctor's name is his biggest secret. The real question is why would a name be so important. Here's what I think, what if Hurt sealed the Time War in a time lock and used his name. The Doctor's actual name as the code to break the lock. We already know from the End of Time parts 1 and 2 that the Time Lords were attempting to destroy all creation and become creatures of pure consciousness. I think that if anyone found out his name that they could then reopen the Time War and bring about the destruction of the Universe.

With the announcement of Jesus Navas signing for City and most likely Fernandinho, Pellegrini as manager and possibly Isco following him, I really don't see us beating them next season.

Even if we make a few signings I still don't think we'll beat them. They finished 2nd last season playing poorly, with these additions and possibly Cavani, they're almost unbeatable.

This additions to Hart, Kompany, Toure, Aguero, Tevez, Silva, Dzeko scares me. Having Mourinho back calms me a little, but honestly not much.

              Hart

Clichy, Kompany, Nastasic, Zabaleta
        
       Toure,   Fernandinho
   
   Navas, Aguero/Tevez, Silva

     Dzeko/Tevez/Aguero/Cavani

That's a ridiculous line up. Hazard and Mata are better than Navas, Silva (not by much imo). Cech is better than Hart. I believe they're better than us at every other position, including bench. 

I make this post hoping someone will explain how I'm wrong and need to calm down. Please? I already apologized if this post is stupid.

We have offices in London, San Francisco, Madrid, Paris, Milan, Berlin and Amsterdam, and supporters in nearly every country in the world.

The web is at the centre of everything Survival does. The size of our online audiences are exploding and millions of people visit our site each year. Hundreds of thousands are signed up to hear from us by email and on Facebook. Our stories feature in the world’s press each week.

We are looking for a web developer who is already confident with development and maintenance of Rails applications, and who wants to use their skills for something truly meaningful.

All of Survival’s web applications are developed in Rails, including public facing websites in seven languages (you don’t have to know the others, but you do have to be able to write good English), as well as internal apps supporting Survival’s campaigning, press and fundraising operations. As well as maintaining and actively developing these applications there is the opportunity to work on exciting new next-generation online publishing projects. Survival hosts its web apps on managed stacks on Engine Yard and Heroku, so although you will need to be versed in server administration this won’t be the main focus of your work.

Skills required:

- Ruby, Rails
- HTML/CSS
- Javascript/jQuery
- RDBMS design and admin (MySQL/Postgres)
- TDD
- awareness of security best practices

As well as the technical skills, you will need to be committed to Survival’s aims and ideals. Survival is a registered charity in the UK and a 501©(3) nonprofit in the US.

You will be based in Survival’s central London office. This is a full-time position.

The salary range is £29-34k depending on your skills and experience. To apply, please send a CV and covering email including:

- who you are and why you want the job
- a brief overview of previous Rails projects
- a summary of any open source contributions (a GitHub profile is ideal)

Let me be absolutely clear on this - at this point, I have at least a century's worth of decent sci fi and alternative shows to watch. If the next doctor is female, I shall not tune in, simply because it'll be pandering to feminism and positive discrimination.

Over the years, we've seen a slow decrease in the amount of positive male models on television that children in particular to watch; we've seen an increase in strong, female leads which is no bad thing, and we've seen an increase in strong, ethnic based leads; but when you consider that many of the *noticeable* stars on TV and film these days are dark, gritty and from a dystopian backdrop to say the least, I believe it to be even more essential that the doctor remain male.

We live in a society today, where, sadly, the shiny magic window in the corner is left to tend to the babysitting duties and responsibilities for education as well as entertainment; in the case of the BBC this is actually ok, as it's a part of the mandate - but not when it's the sole crutch that many parents depend up in order to keep their children quiet and occupied. As opposed to as little as 10 to 15 years ago when children saw absolutely nothing wrong with going outside and playing with their friends, these days it's all social media; children would rather stay in doors and play on console systems, leaving socialising to places such as facebook, twitter, xbox live and PSN (playstation network). This is a sad indictment of our time, and I think leads to a profoundly deeper problem.

Classically, male role models would be sought from family friends as well as the male parental figure; but as society's concept of what a family unit composes is redefined and reconfigured on an almost daily basis, I believe that this is, to say the least, detrimental. There's nothing wrong with being gay or transgendered, and while I would argue that there are no heroes or role models for the latter to look to, the former has *certainly* seen more encouragement from media attention. So what then, is to become of the straight male? Not even the *white* straight male, but those people who have no real strengthened family unit, where a father is missing altogether? Instilment of a social and moral code, direction and the teaching of compassion is something sorely missing in today's corporate world, and our heroes are no less viable a place to gain these insights than anywhere else we might seek to look.

I loathe and detest the idea that the next doctor might be female; not only because it is most evidently bowing to lobbying pressure from gay and women's rights groups, but simply because this generation doesn't *have* anything strong and male to look up to in the same way that female viewers might.",false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,null,null,self,(x-post from /r/gallifrey) Why I feel it's important for the doctor to be male,0,http://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/1fnchh/xpost_from_rgallifrey_why_i_feel_its_important/

Helped a mate move last weekend and the flat (Kingston area) has an old Telewest broadband box piped in - can this be removed by us or is he stuck with it?

2nd photo shows the exterior unit is missing the protective box.

It's all a bit of a mess and we're just wondering what can be done

So, Clint. He's a player who often divides opinion in this sub, and in the real world.

At Fulham in the 2011-2012 season he played 37 premier league games, scoring 17 goals and assisting 6.

Commanding a fee of ONLY 6m, he was stolen from under Liverpool's nose :P by the mighty spurs.

Whilst at Tottenham he has played 22 premiership games, scored 7 and assisted 4. Markedly lower than his Fulham tally.

~~----------------------------------------------------------~~

So, here are my questions for you:

Has Clint Dempsey been worth the transfer fee?

How would you rate his first season with Tottenham compared to previous seasons?

Why has he not had as impressive a goal tally?

As an extremely consistent Fulham player, how has he compared for us? (Especially as he's often been criticised for inconsistency, and poor performances!)

Please can someone else do the next player discussion thread, because my one is so bad? :P

With John Hurt being an unknown incarnation, then that means that even though Smith is the 11th Doctor he is the 12 Incarnation.  I am assuming risk in presuming that John Hurt is a past Doctor based on the interaction between Hurt and Smith.

Now common fan held theory is that there are 13 incarnations, even though there has been a lot thrown in to try and state otherwise.  Since that is ingrained so deep into the viewers then the writers are going to have to address that if they plan on going after 13 incarnations.

In comes the the 13th incarnation, the 12th Doctor.  I think it would be neat to see his decline into the Valeyard.  See him start to fear death, and look for a way out, until he decides to do a lot of dark stuff to get more regeneration energy.  They won't have to touch on him going back to his past self too much since the Time Lords are time locked, so the Valeyard looks elsewhere for regeneration energy.

http://i.imgur.com/8PGaqhd.png  
Position: Midfielder  
Age: 18 (04/09/1994)  
Nationality: Irish  
Joined the Academy: July 2011  
  
""Another exciting attacking player who was signed by Tottenham after playing his youth football for his local side Villa FC in Waterford, Ireland. Having become a full-time member of the Spurs academy just over one year ago, the 18-year-old became a regular for the Under-18 side last season. McEvoy is highly regarded by his country, having represented the Republic of Ireland at Under-16, 17 and 19 level.  
McEvoy's strength is his incredible pace which has seen him become a feared winger at youth level. With natural ability on the ball, Spurs appear to have successfully replicated Gareth Bale. If he can improve at the same rate as the Wales international then there is no reason why he cannot find himself a part of the first team squad.""  
  
McEvoy was listed in the Tottenham U21 lineup ten times this season, appearing in nine matches. He played RM in all appearances except one, where he played LM.  
McEvoy scored one goal against Liverpool u21, one goal against West Brom u21, and one goal against West Ham u21, for a total of three goals for the season. He added three assists as well.  
He made his first international appearance for the Republic of Ireland u17 squad against the Greek u17 team on 25/03/11. He has been capped five times, all for friendlies. McEvoy played four games for Ireland's u17 side and one game for their u19 side.

Alright, so this is the kind of thing I'm going to try to do every week. The trouble is that stats and info on some of these players are extremely difficult to find. I'm not fully convinced my stats are right, my google searches came back with little to no info. But, if you like it, give me suggestions on how to make it better/what players to do next.

The always fantastic Spooky finished up [his latest blog post](http://www.dearmrlevy.com/dml/2013/6/4/tottenham-send-their-regards) with this very amusing story:



*We should accept Madrid's interest to speak to us and allow for Perez and a delegation to visit the Lane to see if we can mend this not so special relationship and look towards a marriage of politics. Agree a deal allowing them to sign Bale, a deal that makes both clubs happy, then drink merrily and dance. Bale leaves the party to sign the contract (formally) along with agent and a Madrid representative. Perez and Zidane remain to enjoy the hospitality. The doors to the meeting room shut.*

*Then the band start to play 'Can't Smile Without You'. The penny drops. Perez leans forward, pulls Tim Sherwood's blazer sleeve upwards to reveal he's wearing Under Armour.*

*There is no Bale to Madrid agreement. There is no consummation of the marriage. It's a trick. No contract signing will take place. The Luka Modric transfer hasn't been forgotten.*

*Levy shows no mercy and Perez and Zidane are cut down with restraining orders.*

Vastra and Jenny are prime examples, and that's pushing aside River Song, a time lord who's just as cunning and even more deceiving than the Doctor. People tend to forget that companions aren't damsels in distress, and I know that this is at the focal point of this whole issue; but a tradition that might have started as such has been flipped on it's head as the Doctor is very much dependent of them. In that sense, I see both women and men of equal importance in the series.

Just because he CAN turn into a woman doesn't mean he SHOULD. I feel like if this scenario were swapped and we were talking about a woman turning into a man, it would be out of the question.

I wonder if the relationships that the Companions had with the Doctor during the Russell T. Davies era served as representations of how RTD himself felt about the Doctor when he was growing up in a somewhat parallel development--or at least how he would imagine being as a companion, to some extent.

We have three main Companions during the RTD era (all three female), but we see four main relationships explored through them: Rose as a protegée to the Doctor, Rose as a love interest for the Doctor, Martha as one with unrequited feelings towards the Doctor, and Donna as a friend to the Doctor.  Why do I think these could be feelings that RTD had growing up?  Well... Let's look at the Classic Who Doctors.  (And consider that RTD was born the same year that Doctor Who premiered to get a better handle on how strong some of the Doctors would be in his mind...)

The first two Doctors were intelligent men who were guides to their respective Companions and led them in learning.  Though there were many times when these two acted in a more parental fashion, more familial-feeling relationships didn't really emerge until the Third and Fourth Doctors (Three forming a very parental bond with Jo Grant and Four being close to Sarah Jane and Adric, though seeing Romana as a bit more of an equal).  

That said, the first two Doctors had regenerated by the time RTD was 6, so he likely actually remembers almost none of the First Doctor's serials and would have Three and Four as the core of his ""childhood Doctors.""  Rose's relationship with Nine is reflective of Jo Grant's and Sarah Jane Smith's relationships with Three and Four--very familial, and protective in a non-romantic way.  Perhaps a bit of Rose's relationship with Ten was also influenced by a level of the Four-Romana relationship, where the ""equality"" with Romana was also infused with some of the behind-the-scenes relationship between Lalla Ward (Romana II) and Tom Baker.  Don't forget that, in his mid-teens at this point, it might have seemed to be a broken taboo to see a Doctor in a relationship with (and married to!) one of his Companions, especially as someone who felt like an outsider for his own sexuality. 

There wasn't really a superbly ""handsome"" Doctor until Five, though he seemed a bit more stand-offish to me with his companions than romantic (though I can easily see a crush forming on this incarnation of the Doctor, especially a gay lad nearing 20). 

Because both Peter Davison *and* the Fifth Doctor weren't known at the time for having a relationship with a Companion, he could be seen as less attainable and therefore the Doctor would likely have gone to a place where yes, this is a very attractive man, but he's not interested in you because he sees you as nothing more than a child, even an intelligent one--much like how Ten views Martha. (This could have even been made worse if RTD identified strongly with Adric, who saw more kindness with Four and was pushed a bit more to the side once the Fifth Doctor came around--also, Adric's actor Matthew Waterhouse later came out as gay.)

And then you have the very specific friendly antagonism (sort of) and ""testing"" that seems more indicative of the behaviors of the Sixth and Seventh incarnations of our remaining Time Lord.  While not necessarily equals, these two respected and challenged their Companions a bit more (though I'm less familiar with Six, I know that he is at least somewhat challenging towards Peri during his early adventures with her--and Seven is very challenging in his ""mentorship"" of Ace).  

But whose relationship with the Tenth Doctor does this sound like?  Yes, my point exactly: Donna Noble.  While not his equal, Donna reminds me quite a bit of Ace in her willingness to challenge the Doctor, her concerns when she thinks that he is keeping information from her, and--actually, this is a brilliant final piece of the puzzle--the fact that she becomes a Time Lord, sort of.  (Short reason why the ""companion becoming a Time Lord"" thing is a connection: Ace was to have entered the Time Lord Academy in future seasons had Doctor Who continued from its 1989 season).  

**TL;DR**:  We see three of the four relationships I listed (Companion as protegée to the Doctor, Companion as--sort of--a romantic interest to the Doctor, Companion as closer to an equal with the Doctor and causing disagreement) in a very specific order in the original series, though there would be good reason for the Doctor to also feel unattainable in the middle of those relationships, especially as a young gay male fan of the series.",false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,null,null,self,RTD's relationship growing up with Doctor Who and how it affected his development of Companion relationships with the Doctor,2,http://www.reddit.com/r/doctorwho/comments/1fp7qv/rtds_relationship_growing_up_with_doctor_who_and/

I was hoping this would get some attention! I just started it and I was hoping some of you guys would show some interest in it. I want this to be a place where all kind of Whovians can come and share all kinds of Theory's. (: 

Since this is the start of my Forum I am still looking for Positions. I am looking for another Admin and a Designer. Also looking for people who would like to write Reviews and post news into the forum. 


Of course I am not expecting to find people who would fill those Jobs but what I am mostly looking for is people who like Doctor Who!(: Please help me get this as far as possible to the front page of at least this sub? I would like to see an increase of people on my Forum. (: (I am not doing this for Karma, I want people to really enjoy my Forum...)

tl;dr: took all day to make what should have been a 2-3 hour journey. Most of the delay was due to station staff telling me lies. The TOC I bought the tickets from wasn't at fault. Do I still claim off the TOC or what? If I am offered a refund am I obliged to take it in vouchers given that the chances of my taking a train in the next 12 months are very slim?

---

*Edit: just found this:* ""Claims for delays or cancellations can also be made for season and weekly tickets. If a journey uses more than one train provider it is the one where the delay was experienced that should be contacted for reclaiming the cost of a ticket. Delay Repay is a Department for Transport-backed initiative aimed at standardising the rail compensation process.""

So it's not the one I bought the ticket from, it's the one that was at fault? That makes more sense, however I would say it's the station staff for telling lies and National Rail for not posting delays (I just checked the site again for the same route this weekend and it still says no delays - I was told by the coordinator that the works would be every Saturday for the next few weeks). So I still don't know who to contact. Or are individual stations operated by TOCs?

---

Last week I brought my kids over from North Wales for a week in England. No ticket office at the station so we paid on the train. £86.40 for return tickets for the 3 of us. Outwards journey was uneventful.

Problems began on the return trip. I checked the times on the National Rail app and there weren't any notices of delays. We got off at Manchester Oxford Road to transfer and were told by staff that all the trains going that way had been cancelled and we needed to take a bus to Chester and get the train from there.

We waited 15 minutes for the bus, then another 15 because it was delayed due to rush hour traffic in Manchester. When it arrived the driver told us he was only going as far as Newton le Willows. The coordinator told us to hop on the train to Piccadilly where we found there was a train going to Chester. At this stage I would point out that we were originally supposed to be on the 5:33 from Oxford Road; we were now on the 6:45 from Piccadilly meaning it had taken over an hour just to get out of Manchester.

When we got to Chester I spotted a sign explaining what the station staff had somehow been unable to explain: engineering works between Manchester and Chester meant that you had to take a bus to get to any of the stops on the way, but trains were still running direct via another route, contrary to what we had been told. I also spotted that the next train going to where we needed to be was in 1hr30mins.

Fortunately I managed to work out a route taking an earlier train, going past our station and getting off at the next one and taking a train coming back in the other direction. That shaved about 30 minutes off vs waiting for the direct train.

It was 10pm by the time we walked in the door. My kids were exhausted and I was pissed off.

I'm staying at a colleague's house in Swinton, i don't drive and i'm on a budget. I do have access to a bycicle though, and i'm working in Wath-upon-Dearne.

I've already walked all along the Hope Valley in Derbyshire.
Since i'm working on weekdays, i've got the next weekend free, and one more saturday, before i leave.

I'll probably be visiting York this weekend.

So, yorkshire redditors, what not too expensive/free things should i visit in the city of York?

Bonus question: what else might be worth a train-trip in Yorkshire? (considering the same time/money constraints).

Thank you all very much in advance!

Little back story -I've been living abroad for the last year, before I left in June last year I lived in Cambridge, consider myself a humanist and blah blah blah head up my own ass etc etc

Anyway 1 year later I've come back to quite a lot of ""immigrants are doing this, immigrants are doing that"" directly out of the mouths of some close family members, which they certainly weren't doing before I left!

I guess my questions are as follows

Has there been a dramatic increase in immigration while I've been away or is this just daily mail speak?

Have there been any official news reports I've missed about the amount of illegal immigration over the last year or is it as it ever was?

Is there anywhere I can look upon official documents about estimated numbers of benefit cheats or anything in this country, because I am genuinely worried. Not for my country, it seems just like it ever was except now half my family appear to have become racists while I've been away.

I've got a pretty good idea that half of what's been said to me isn't even remotely true but anyone who has any specific knowledge on the topic would be readily listened too!

What Moffat is  asking me to believe here is that ""The Silence"" kidnapped and replaced Amy to extract her timelord daughter.  A daughter that was then raised by monsters in a psycho orphanage,  escaped and spent her teenage years being her parent's best friend.  Upon reaching a certain age she mortally wounds and  then falls in love with the Doctor using her remaining regenerations to save his life.  Afterwards she becomes a well adjusted student of archaeology,  until she is reacquired by The Silence who build a suit to control her against her will. A suit so necessary that they developed the entire human space program to build it.  All so the Doctor could be killed in an inescapable fixed point of time making it impossible for him to ever get to Transelor to answer a question.  The Silence unknowingly fail in this diabolical and remarkably resource intensive plan to lure a man to a spot and shoot him. So unbeknownst to them he gets to Transelor.  The question is asked and the universe ends!  

Wait... no! That didn't happen.. He got to Transelor was forced to open his tomb.. Find a portal to his time line.. talks to his dead wife.. sacrifices and then saves Clara.. By the end: bad guys die,  good guys live,  and we see that the Doctor's big secret is a skeleton in the closet named John Hurt.

Am I really asked to believe that the entire past 2 seasons have been devoted to not letting John Hurt be on the show?  

I'm just thinking that by now I should either have a grip on what is happening,  or be completely lost.  Instead I find myself understanding everything only to realize that it is totally without logic or consequence.  Steven Moffat has duped me into thinking there was a point to any of this,  and that some how the confusion of it all was better than straight encapsulated episodes.

Coutinho has shown why he was a top rated prospect at Inter and has the creative and technical ability that we need for our number 10 man. Meanwhile, him and Coutinho have formed an absolutely dangerous partnership and work excellently together.

Suarez's sale could land us his replacement in the lineup, Henrikh Mkhitaryan, who could play the right mid position where we proposed Suarez would go. 50 mil is a LOT of cash. Of course we wouldn't blow it all in one season, but we will also have some other sales, such as Carroll, Skrtel, and other players, we could get a good left winger. I must admit I don't know much about Iago Aspas but if he can play left wing and assuming we do in fact sign him he can play there. A front four of Aspas, Coutinho, and Henrikh behind Sturridge would be absolutely dangerous. Henderson can also play in the LM spot which he did in the Newcastle game, where he preformed great.

We could also land a new LB (Danny Rose, Lucas Digne) and hopefully Kyriakos Papadopulous. These changes along with a few other transfers could set the way towards a future Champions League spot.

1)There will be more jobs.

2)There will be less completion for jobs.

3)Immigrant numbers will go down and the view of immigrants from locals will be improved.

4)Having less new Immigrants on welfare will reduce the cost of welfare and make cuts less likely.

5)NHS will spend less money on care for new immigrants this means they will have a bigger budget to care for everyone already in the county.

6)Tax rate for will come down allowing for a better standard of living.

7)Reducing the amount of new immigration from the EU will make it easier to obtain a visa via the correct channels. 

Most poorer immigrants measurement of the economy is how many people they know who don’t have jobs. How hard it is to get a job. How much their bills have gone up.  People can blow all the political smoke up their ass they want but at the end of the day they see the economy with their own eyes they live it. They know when it is better and they know when it is worse.

They can either vote for or against their own interests.  

So maybe the question should be why would an immigrant not vote for the UKIP?

Mine is:
               Azpi, Mangala, Ivanovic(Luiz if he stays), Cole
                                Khedira, Ramires
                             Modric, Mata, Hazard
                                        Cavani

I certainly think we need more depth at the back. I'm not sure if Ivanovic should start, but if Luiz leaves I'm not sure what other cb's Chelsea would be looking to buy. Also, I really dont want Azpi to start. I really think he does more harm, than good. The only reason I put him there was because, I haven't heard anything about Chelsea buying a new RB. 

For the holding mids, I think is pretty solid. Maybe Lampard would start every few games.

Modric, is definitely a good choice, or Schurrle, or KDB if they dont get Modric.

And of course Cavani would be wonderful, and if not, I heard Dzeko is also an option. If Lukaku comes maybe he could be second choice.

First, Suarez had 5 assists for us all season, so I am discounting his assist contribution as that is not a very difficult number to replace IMO.

We didn't have Sturridge and Coutinho for the entire season, we had them both starting on 1/26/13, the day Coutinho signed. That is where I started my analysis.

Our league form from that day on was as follows:

When you count Suarez goals:

7W, 6D, 2L - 27pts, 31GF, 15GA, +16GD

When you don't count Suarez goals*: 

6W, 5D, 4L - 23pts, 23GF, 14GA, +9GD

*
*The Chelsea result remains the same (a draw) because Suarez scored one and gave one away with a penalty from his handball.*

As you can see, without Suarez, we still fared pretty damn well once Rodgers had brought in a few of his key signings.

This coupled with how well we played in the 4 end of season games without Suarez at all (which are part of my analysis) lead me to think that taking the cash from a Suarez sale and buying a good CB and a capable finisher might actually see us improve next season. Something that I didn't think before looking into this.

I don't if anyone will find this interesting, but I thought I'd share.

It wasn't mentioned in any of the tests. 

The articles that appeared today have surprised me, and people seem to get quite angry about people who drive in the middle lane. 

The arguments I've heard so far are:

1. ""It's safer."" I always drive in the middle lane at 70mph because to me that seems safer than changing lanes every few hundred yards. How can it be safer to keep speeding up and slowing down and changing lanes? 

2. ""You are blocking others."" If I'm driving at 70mph no one should be allowed to overtake me, so who am I blocking besides drivers breaking the law? Besides, there's a third lane for the people who choose to drive like that. 

3. ""It creates congestion."" The motorways on which I drive are already congested. If everyone was trying to stay in one lane it would be much worse.

secondly, too american, I'm all for adding extra culture and nationalities to the show but this is set in america, with an american master and american companion and somehow it doesnt feel right for Doctor Who..

Thirdly: The hollywood romance that appears to be happening, The Doctor having a fling or whatever it is with this woman doctor also doesn't seem right (even if she does have large breasticles..)

And Finally...this whole 13 lives thing, having not seen much of the originals, is the movie the first place we learn about the regeneration limit? if so, did whomever wrote the movie have involvement in Who prior or after the movie? I'd feel a bit aggrieved if this one off movie with a one off writer etc was the entire reason this rule is in place and in theory could end the show unless(and i assume they will) they change it somehow(other than the '507' line in the Sarah jane Adventures)

Let's get the tl;dr version out of the way first, because this will probably get long: Hurt is the elderly version of Paul McGann’s 8th doctor, and not the Valeyard or 8.5 or 0 or some of the other theories I’ve seen. 

Here's my logic: 

1. We know that the doctor’s clothes are a mix between 8 and 9’s outfits. 
Of all the doctors there are two regenerations that aren’t seen on screen, the change between 2 and 3 and 8 and 9 (unless I’m missing one) 

2. In the finale 11 knows what the Hurt Doctor did, so this means whatever Hurt did was in one of his previous incarnations, since 11 does not seem to have too much knowledge of his own future (10 seems genuinely surprised to meet the fake doctor in The Next Doctor and doesn't immediately know he’s a fake, so him recognizing the Hurt Doctor tells me it's someone from his past and not the Valeyard or 12 or 13)

3. Based on what we know to date, we assume that 8 is the incarnation who fights the Time War, but we don't know where the war falls along 8's personal timeline, do we? Why can't Paul McGann have grown old, grown a goatee and kicked some Dalek butt? Or (more likely) maybe the old age is something that happens to 8 as a result of the Time War? He could regenerate into 9 from here. 

4. This idea might also give some weight to the rumors that McGann is going to appear in the 50th anniversary. McGann is obviously older than he was when The Movie came out, so why can't they say he continues to age into an elderly version of the character? Do we assume Hartnell was BORN 80? There was never a 20 year old version of the 1st Doctor running around Gallifrey?

5. With 50 years of Doctor Who it seems like a dick move to throw in a new doctor that nobody has ever heard of before into the mix (thinking about some of the ideas I've read about him being 8.5 or 0). It makes it hard to write around and goes against years of cannon, which tells us over and over again that Matt is 11 (including several episodes where they have shown us all 11 versions of the Doctor).

6. I love the idea that Hurt is Doctor 12 (because John Hurt is THE MAN) but he’s an Oscar winning actor, and I doubt he’d sign on to join a seasons-long television show (thought I seriously hope I’m wrong). It's great as a one-time thing or occasional appearance, but signing on as The Doctor seems iffy.

So there you have it: He's an old Paul McGann. If you want to call this idea 8.5 because 8 will age naturally (or unnaturally) to become the Hurt Doctor who will then regenerate into 9 then sure, call that 8.5.

I’m not as well versed in Who as the rest of you, so please I’m open to suggestions. What am I not seeing?

I have a request from one of my favourite clients for 2 Front-end developers to join their team in Cheadle.

the organisation is a major eCommerce brand and the positions are brand new and due to an increase in workload rather than replacements.

What I am looking for is front-end developers not designers. You will need to be extremely competent with HTML5, CSS3 and Javascript all hand-coded. If you have any experience of CSS pre-processors that would be an added bonus.

Salary; My client is willing to pay up to £30,000 per annum, however the ideal would be in the region of £26,000.

Benefits; Discount on products, 25 days holiday + bank holidays, Flexi time and a pool table + MAME arcade machine.

This began a brief conversation, which went like this:

Fk - ""Yeah. Still, I'd rather wait than use the self-service""

Bloke - ""I don't agree with those things. I mean, I know it's the way now and all that, but they're taking jobs that women used to work at""

Fk - ""How do you mean?""

Bloke - ""Like, there's nothing left that woman normally work at. If they want to get a house now, they just have to get themselves pregnant and get themselves on the housing register""


To this, I came up with a near-poetically articulate, perfectly worded rebuttal, in which I neatly explained how archaic his views were, and that women were equally as equipped as men to make their way through the world in this modern era. Except, I was so taken aback by the legitimately sexist nature of his comment that I forgot how to speak, and it came out as ""Uh"", and from there, the conversation progressed onto other things which were equally as disconnected from my understanding of society.

This encounter followed something from earlier in the same day, in which a colleague talking to me about my new position asked me how I was getting on.  I'll not write the script for that one (bit too specific, and I've colleagues who are Redditors), but the gist of his line was that I would have no problem because the person I replaced is a girl, that I actually have skills relevant to the job rather than skills relevant to giving head, more disparaging stuff about the girl's intellect, followed by disparaging stuff about her being pregnant. Again, I was aghast at what I was hearing.

In the first case, there seemed to be a serious disbelief that a woman could be a valid member of society in any meaningful way. In the second, there was a palpable sense of anger towards the girl, that she'd achieved more than him despite her having a fanny, and him simply being one. This sort of shit is new to me.

I'm an American lady moving to Belfast in September. 

I've lived abroad before and have travelled fairly extensively through Europe, Asia and Africa. Belfast seems like a great place and I'm excited to explore NI at large. In preparation, I've been doing the usual basic research -- reading up on cultural norms, holidays, neighborhoods. That kind of thing. But I wonder if it's backfiring on me, because I almost feel like I'm going into a bit of pre-move culture shock. 

So here's where the dumb 'Murican comes in.

I just keep coming across stuff on Protestant/Catholic issues and it just boggles my mind. Now I know it's not how it used to be in past decades, and that the violence isn't so frequent anymore. Hell, it's not so much the threat of violence that bothers me -- after all, Belfast has low crime rates, and I am from a country where gun violence is taken as part and parcel of city life.

It's the psychological tension. Some things I read about present-day Belfast, like peace walls and school segregation, makes it seem like it's almost two separate, slightly volatile cities. Obviously there are issues with social stratification in almost every country, be it religious or racial or whatever. It's definitely there in the USA, I'm not under any delusion that it isn't, but it seems like it's pervasive in NI. I worry about eggshell caution that seems to be necessary -- I've seen sites that recommend against calling NI the United Kingdom or Ireland, even though it is technically both, depending on if you're talking politically and geographically.

So r/northernireland, am I out of my mind? Are the sectoral instigators a minority, or is it as pervasive as it seems? Will the locals hear my accent and lower their expectations accordingly? And while we're at it, any sites or communities online that present a more neutral/up-to-date view of the country?

I know you are on your couches watching Skysports due to the Spanish threads that have been started.

Let's watch our little superstar get 90 minutes under his belt, something he needs.

Skysports just updated line up for Germany:

4 - 2 - 3 -1

------------ Leno

Sorg - Ginter - Thesker - Jantschke

--------- Rode (Off, Polter on) - Rudy

Herrmann - HOLTBY (C) - Mlapa (Off, Clemens on)

---------- Lasogga (Off, Volland on)

Dutch lineup (looks really strong 4-3-3):

---------------- Zoet

Van Rhijn - De Vrij - Martins Indi - Blind

--- Van Ginkel - Strootman - Maher

-- Wijnaldum (Off, Jozefzoon on) - De Jong - John


Americans, I just read that ESPNU and ESPN3 are showing the U21 games.

-------------------------

24th min, GOAL: Maher Netherlands 1 - 0 Germany

John cuts in from the left and finds Maher who has timed a run into the box from midfield. He can't control the ball well, not that it matters, his poor shot is enough to find the back of the net. Germany should really have had a man marking him as 3 seemed to be in no mans land in the box.

EDIT: Gooners (I'm guessing) are downvoting everything in this thread. Ignore them.

37th min, GOAL: Wijnaldum  Netherlands 2 - 0 Germany

Amazing solo effort by Wijnaldum. Picks the ball up on the right well outside the 18 yard box. Easily pushes past 3 defenders and gets a decent shot on goal. Keeper gets a hand to it but it isn't enough, goal goes in. Very Bale-esque.

39th min, CHANCE: Germany

Holtby gets the ball on the edge of the box and draws two players, a cute back heel sets up a German midfielder who sprays his shot wide.

---------------------------

HALF TIME, Netherlands 2 - 0 Germany.

A quiet first half with the Netherlands well on top. They are holding their shape far better and it is proving the difference, wide men cutting inside and punishing poor German defence. Germany have looked dangerous enough when on attack, with Holtby creating a few half chances, but the team have been pinned back for the majority of the game thus far. Oddly enough the sprinklers come on fully at half time and there is now water on the pitch.

------------------------------

45th min, PENALTY - GOAL: RUDY Netherlands 2 - 1 Germany

Germany dispossess the Dutch in defence and a neat ball is threaded through to Holtby who is fouled in the box. Rudy steps up and slots it home. Germany back in it. Penalty well earned by Holtby. He had to get in front of his man to draw the foul.

55th min, CHANCE: Netherlands

They have looked dangerous from set plays all game and this was the best. A corner is floated into the box and a  Dutch player raises above the rest but it goes wide. 

56th min, CHANCE: Germany

Super skill by Holtby. A clearing kick from the RB finds Holtby on the chest who deftly lifts it over the defender with his second touch, his third is a beatiful through ball over the head of the defence, sending Hermann into the box. His cross finds a German shirt (Mlapa?) who misses a golden opportunity. The biggest near-miss thus far.

59th min, CHANCE: Germany

Holtby picks the ball up deep in his own half and slips a defender. He carries the ball over halfway before sending Hermann away down the right, the defender is forced to let it go for a corner. A short corner is taken and the ball ends up with Holtby outside the box, he gets a shot off with plenty of power but it hits the side of the net.

62nd min, CHANCE: Germany

That one rattles the bar. Volland slips his man on the edge of the box and sends a shot in that has the keeper beaten every day of the week. It hits the ball and falls awkwardly to a white shirt, he can't get enough behind the ball to beat the keeper second time around.

64th min, CHANCE: Germany

Another, too much to write out as they are leaning on the Dutch now and churning out decent chances. 2 substitutions made as Germany chase an all important equaliser.

69th min, CHANCE: Netherlands

Holtby is dispossessed in attack and after three quick touches Jozefzoon is through on goal. The keeper comes out and smothers well. 

75th min, CHANCE: Germany

Holtby picks up the ball on halfway with a man on him, slips him and then pushes past 3 more defenders. His through ball was inch perfect to the striker who is unable to beat the keeper. The keeper did well to gather the ball off of the toes of the striker, perhaps if he had pushed it infront of himself he could have drawn the penalty and a red.

80th min, GOAAAAAAAAAL: HOOOOOLTBY!!!! Netherlands 2 - 2 Germany

Amazing solo effort. Gets the ball from a throw in near the corner and has 4 men on him, drifts across the face of the box to the opposite edge of the 18 yard box and slots a beautiful goal into the corner. Did the whole thing by himself, commentators say ""An amazing goal for an amazing performance"".

82nd min, CHANCE: Germany

Hermann is again unleashed down the right and hits a first time shot that floats over the crossbar. Germany really leaning on the Dutch now, DM taken off for another striker.

85th min, CHANCE: Netherlands

The Dutch find space on the right and 3 players steam into the box. A decent cross in finds the head of one attacker but it shaves the post and goes out. On replay it looks like he collided with his own player (De Jong) which prevented a goal.

89th min, GOAL: Fer. Netherlands 3 - 2 Germany

They have looked dangerous from set pieces all day and this goal was probably deserved. Another ball floated in perfectly from a corner and Fer flies well above the rest to hammer it in. Heartbreak for the Germans, but a goal that could have occurred once or twice already tonight.

90th+3, CHANCE: Germany

Holtby picks the ball up on the counter and sends it down the left. The first time cross is too heavy for Hermann on the right and on another day it could have been a fairy tale.

FULLTIME: Netherlands 3 - 2 Germany

Our boy Holtby is easy MOTM. He coordinated every inch of German attack and they were the better team for a good 40 mins. Unfortunately going behind by 2 was too much to claw back. Holtby thrived on being the main cog of the attack, one touch passing unleashed the two wide players and the striker many times over. The two Dutch stars Strootman and Maher won the midfield battle against Rhode and Rudy which stifled Germanys link up play for far too much of the game. De Jong was quiet but the wide men Wijnaldum and John had the ability to turn possession into chances which ultimately won them the game. 

Commentators: Great game, game of the tournament so far. Holtby deserved the win, he earned a penalty and scored a beautiful solo goal. Both teams showed heart and the Netherlands were slightly better on the day.",false,coys,t5_2ryq7,null,null,self,Holtby watch thread!

You all witnessed the haircut saga. She gave me an amazing cut and I came out almost beaming. As usual, the next day it looked great. Since then: not so much so. This was two and a half weeks ago. 

I spent 45 minutes talking to this woman about what I want, took her 50 pictures of haircuts, was reassured that the cut would be fine for 4-6 weeks, paid circa £70 for it, and now the fringe is growing out too fast and is giving me the rotten bloody hump. 

The only reason I decided to go short again was because this woman absolutely convinced me that she'd work a minor miracle (giving an amazing short haircut for a lady). 

So, should I call her and tell her it's growing out rubbish and that I'm not that happy after all? I cannot be doing with £70 haircuts every four weeks because she didn't cut the damn fringe short enough in the first place. 

No, I'm not posting pics. Take my word for it, it's utterly crap.

I decided on Wednesday to order it off amazon and make sure it was dispatched from Amazon itself.

Just in case I decided to have it delivered at a collect+ store in case someone was out or something happened, I need this item and I needed it today really but I wanted to make sure I had it and this seemed like the best option.

I arrive there at 6pm and they say they do not have it, I got a dispatch email and a mail from collect+ saying it was at the store.  I contacted collect+ and they say they have it shown as delivered, whatever, no time to argue I get on to Amazon and see what they can do. 

Amazon say that the courier delivered the item to the wrong store entirely and unfortunately I did not get this information, I wish I had.  After having some work related stuff confirmed I really do need this tomorrow and usually like to be in at work at 8pm so I need to pick up this item from whevever this collect+ location is.  I call Amazon and they do not budge and the maximum they can offer is a refund and refund of delivery charges.

I explain that I entrusted them to deliver this item, I needed it a lot of people may say ""you can use wireless"" and this is true I could and I think I might need to find a way and get that working but it will not be pretty.  There is actually a wireless access point but whenever I connect to it in the office there is an issue (not many people know the password) and the problem is someone moved it and I have no idea where it is, does anyone have a free or decent reasonable charge wifi scanner for iOS&gt;

Anyway, I am just depressed about Amazon who used to pretty much pride themselves on customer service so I have decided to return anything I can and cancel over £300 items I have waiting for dispatch.

A chance to make a customer happy, and they do not care.

Instead of making a multitude of posts, I figured to put all my thoughts in one post and allow you more experienced fans to comment. 

1-	 Why does the Great Intelligence want to kill the doctor at all points in his timeline? I mean I understand he wants to best the doctor in his personal battles    with him, but what gain is there for the great intelligence to kill him at every point in his timeline?

2A- Assuming he’s (it’s?) just a large bad ass and has a huge hatred for the doctor, causing it to want to destroy the doctor at all parts of the timeline; how does the great intelligence accomplish this? Meaning, he had to have some knowledge of the doctor in order to find those moments where the doctor was vulnerable, like making the doctor pick the wrong Tardis. How does the great intelligence know these small parts of the doctor’s timeline in order to change them? 

2B- Moving along on the assumption the great intelligence just wants to destroy the doctor, why the need to kill him at “all possible points” in his time line? Wouldn’t it make sense to just kill him once, at the start of his life span say, and be done with it?  Does the GI not know that there are ways to kill a time lord without him regenerating? And if we are to assume that the GI killed him at all points in his timeline and yet the doctor was still currently on the floor in Trenzalore, does that mean that there were many more regenerations that were going on? Does this put to rest the 12 regeneration limit? 

3- Assuming the GI had some way about knowing the every step the Doctor took in order to change them ( after all he is called the Great Intelligence), how can Clara know about the correct path necessary to save the Doctor? How can she know which Tardis to point him towards for example?

4- We were shown in Asylum of the Daleks, that Clara was saving the Doctor, even in cases where the GI was not present. Was she then saving the Doctor throughout his timeline? Then what happened at all the times the Doctor dies, like the Cave if Androzzoni, and the ends of doctors # 10 and 9? 

5-	an observation: Had the GI not uploaded Clara and thereby given her super computer skills in the process, Clara would not have been able to save the doctor in Asylum of the Daleks, even after stepping through his time line. Pretty ironic then that had he not uploaded Clara, the doctor would have died before even getting to Trenzalore. 

I would love to hear your views on all this.

I watched the match today. I hope you did as well. It was good fun. I'm writing this because Holtby put on a real show out there. We've had little blips this season where we see his talents and the reasons that we brought him in, but let's be honest. He hasn't done anything substantial in Spurs colors. That's totally okay. He's 22. But, I had a thought about where he fits into the future with Tottenham. And:

----------Striker  
-----Bale------Lennon  
---------Holtby  
----Dembele---Sandro  
BAE---Jan---Kaboul--Walker  
----------Lloris

Now, that is not very different from what we did for most of the latter half of this season. Not very different at all. However, I feel like it is important for this to be a distinct 4-2-1-2-1 rather than a more dense 4-2-3-1 or 4-3-2-1. I noticed that Holtby does well while on his own on a little island. He's very clever. I also noticed that some of his best moments were when people flared up outside from behind him. For that reason, perhaps a 4-3-3 would be effective for him. It wouldn't create as many levels in the formation and it would leave more room for him to be creative.

Bale------Striker----Lennon  
Dembele--Holtby----Sandro  
BAE---Jan---Kaboul--Walker  
-----------Hugo

I like this better. This would also give more room for Bale to roam as a true left winger. Sandro and Dembele are both more central players, to be sure, but this would give us essentially a wall of possession midfield. However, all three midfielders here have the ability to move forward and cycle into other positions.

So. Basically, that's what I think would make Lewis Holtby most effective for Spurs next season. I'm not sure how that would do with the other guys, especially Sandro (iffy on sending him wide) and Lennon (iffy on making him a true winger), but I think this would lead to a much more significant contribution from Lewis.

The first time the Doctor is in Rose's apartment, after looking for and finding the plastic hand that he had torn off the night before, Rose offers to get him some tea. While she is doing this, she is talking to him and asking questions about the night before, when he blew up her workplace. The Doctor, however is not really paying attention, and is instead murmuring to himself. At one point, he looks into a mirror, pulls at his ear and says, ""hmm, little big, but everything seems to be in order"" (or something along these lines. He definitely mentions the size of his ears and says that he has all normal bodyparts). This would seem to imply that he had only recently regenerated, which could make sense, as this was the first episode of the new series, but it does not make much sense in the context of another part of the episode. After this scene, the Doctor leaves, and Rose starts to look into him. She finds a man who knows a lot about him, and has found many instances of  him popping up at important places in time and space (he shows her a picture of the Doc at JFK's assassination, with a family who he kept from going on the Titanic, and a drawing of him at Krakatoa). This would then imply that the Doctor had been regenerated as Nine for a fairly long amount of time for him to be able to do so many things. I just thought it was interesting that, unless he had not had access to a mirror in a very long time, he would have already known about his large ears, and thus would have had no reason to comment on them at Rose's appartement. 

**TL;DR: In the first episode of the new series, Nine remarks on his looks while at Rose's apartment, insinuating that he had recently regenerated. This contradicts the rest of the episode, where it is made to look as if he has been in his ninth regeneration for a long time**

&gt;Analysis of data for 551 fixed speed cameras in 9 areas shows that on average the number of fatal and serious collisions in their vicinity fell by more than a quarter (27%) after their installation.  
&gt;  
&gt;There was also an average reduction of 15% in personal injury collisions in the vicinity of the 551 cameras.  
&gt;  
&gt;However the research also highlights 21 camera sites (in these areas) at which, or near which, the number of collisions appears to have risen enough to make the cameras worthy of investigation in case they have contributed to the increases.

We know as Who fans that Moffat has been creating many overarching and subliminal plot twists since he took over drawing elements from the Russell Davies era into it as well. So here's my idea on the TARDIS. In Series 5 the plot revolved primarily around the exploding TARDIS, Series 6 the death of the doctor and series 7, the impossible girl, now what if these are all linked. Since we know that timelines get incredibly confused, what if the Great Intelligences attack on the Doctors time line is what really causes the TARDIS to explode? now yes we know we hear that 'Silence shall fall' in the TARDIS as the scanner screen cracks but what if this was an effect of the splits in the timelines causing the prophecy of the Silence to come into fruition. Now yes we know that the universe is rebooted, however it is entirely possible due to the nature of causality that this is the cause of the future, but anyhow after with the back Doctor in it, it seemingly carries on with only a few individuals personal histories affected. Since as stated Science teaches us that a cause has an effect so it seemingly possible that for a time traveller who's time machine exists across 'all of time and space' could have his past caused by an event in his personal future because relative to the TARDIS, the future past and present are one and the same.

What if the ""The Office"" approach was put to use in replacing Matt Smith? Have some celebrities come in and portray the role with their utmost bravado, only to be killed quickly and have to regenerate, and do it with several of them. Even if they are not planning on ever having a different race or gender play the Doctor, they could very well get a reaction to each person they put in the spot and use that guide what they do in the future regarding the recasting of The Doctor. The other clever thing they could do, is slip in the real actor who was to replace Smith among them, and use that as the device to get everyone to think that it WON'T be that person, only to go back in time, and only be able to stop the killing and regenerating process at a very specific interval, giving us the new Doctor. 

The more I type about this, the better form it takes in my mind. It would be a prison for Time Lords. Designed to kill them until they run out of regenerations, but because of something or other (maybe the Doctor found out from Rassilon the secret of infinite regerations) he is trapped there basically ""forever"" and being killed so many time, with little interval in between, could give him a memory lapse of unnamed proportions. I think it could pay off really well.

Another idea I had recently, would be for The Doctor to go back in his own timeline, and manipulate himself to take himself as a companion, thusly showing exactly why the Doctor is the way he is, because he influenced himself. And after having been his own companion, he would have to reveal the fact of who he was, and tell his younger self ""NEVER EVER EVER DO THIS IT COULD DESTROY THE TIME VORTEX"" which wold explain why he ""never"" interferes with his own timeline.


TL;DR : What if they replace The Doctor using the same method (the US version) that The Office did for replacing Michael Scott?

What if they attempted to explain a great deal of The Doctor's quirkiness by having him pose as his own companion, far in his past?",false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,null,null,self,Two Ideas I had just this morning concerning recasting The Doctor/plot line progression,2,http://www.reddit.com/r/doctorwho/comments/1fuzd6/two_ideas_i_had_just_this_morning_concerning/

Villa, of course, plays for Barcelona in La Liga, having been bought following the 2010 season which he played with Valencia.  He won the league, Spanish Super Cup, and CL in his first year with Barcelona, as well as the 2010 World Cup with Spain.  He was joint top scorer in the competition with five goals.

He fractured his tibia the following season however, missing both the end of Barcelona's season and Euro 2012.

[Here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mOcF--xlqY) is a video of the 48 goals he has scored as a member of Barcelona.

A couple questions for discussion:

Do you think he is a reasonable target?  Can we get him here, and does he want to come?

How much do you think we should pay if we are to target him?

Do you think he can solve our striker problems(at least short term)?

Finally, how do you believe he would fit in with our current team?

The best example is Cavani. There's a very big group of fans who do not enjoy the (potential) transfer at all, because of the big price tag. Well, let me tell you something. There's absolutely no doubt that Cavani is in the top 5 - or probably even top 3 - of strikers in the world. Yes, he's expensive. Yes, the FPP now exists. But who knows better - us, fans on reddit, or professionals who keep track of accounting at Chelsea? They know what they're doing, and if we spend that money then we can definitely afford it.

TL;DR: Don't moan about the money. People who take care of that know much more than we do. Yes, if the transfer is obviously bad (e.g. 50m for Jose Enrique or something like that) then we can worry, but if we're about to get one of the best strikers in the world who'll upgrade our squad instantly, then let's enjoy that. With the coming of FPP let's not turn into accountants, and still be fans who are ecstatic when a player as good as Cavani joins their club.

*I want to play a game*

Back when this was all fields and chicken still tasted like chicken, I used to play a little music sharing game on various forums and stuff...I call it 'musical trails', and it's always super fun and interesting. Tis a bit more awkward to work out on reddit as copared to a traditional forum, but I think we can still have a laugh with it.....

So, still with me?

Here's the deal.....post your current tune/earworm as a top comment reply - whatever you like.....but, here's the deal - anyone replying to a song must reply to that tune with another tune that is in some way connected to it....... It could be related by name, by genre, by riff, by sample, perhaps those artists collaborated with someone you were listening to, maybe they use the same chord sequence....whatever, just justify why you chose that song to reply and see if anyone else carries on your musical trail!

So without further ado, here's my starter for ten.

Who will play, in what role do you see our prospects and established players evolve.

____________________________________________________________________________________________

I'll start:
I think we should play a classic 4 3 3, top down central midfield. 


Mikel will become the consistent beast he always should have been under Mou, and will start at the 6/CDM position. Chalobah and Ake are his back ups untill he's over his peak and Chalobah and Ake take over.



The 8, our main playmaker is where I'll drop a name. **Leon Goretzka** is the biggest German prospect since Gotze, and could be ours for less then 8M euro's. Brilliant playmaker in the mold of Schweinsteiger and Kroos.



The 10 will ofcourse be Oscar, who will develop as our 
main creative outlet (I believe he will become more suited than Mata).



De Bruyne and McEachran can rotate on 8 and 10. Hopefully academy players like Loftus-Cheek will add to the tactical possibilities, if not we should keep Ramires (for whom I unfortunately do not see a prominent role due to a preference for more passing ability).



EDIT: Requested: This is classic European numbering. The 6 is the defensive midfielder , the 8 depends on the system (in a 433 he's usually the main distributor, in a 4 2 3 1 he is the box-to-box/infiltrant, the 10 is the main creative hub (think Zidane, Riquelme, Ozil or Iniesta).

Note: European numbering does not have a deep lying playmaker, this is a more recent evolution from South America where he is known as the number 5 (Fernando Redondo is the prime example).",false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,null,null,self,"How do you think our central midfield will/should evolve, on longterm?

My suggestion for the time and place are as follows:

Place: The Outhouse  
Time: 3:30pm 

Outhouse is also in the possession of a beer garden, so wear sunscreen. Suggestions for other venues welcome!

That is all. 

**Edit:** So it seems that no one has major objections to meeting at the Outhouse so that's where we will be! Look out for the thread of the day tomorrow (I'll put one up soon as I can) where we will be letting you know the score. The Outhouse opens at 3pm so we should be the only large crowd there so nobody should have too much trouble finding the meetup. People can always PM their numbers to me and get to us that way just in case someone is turning up late or whatever.

Right, basically we all know that the Question is ""Doctor Who?"". Now, originally I thought that this was his actual name but after the last episode and the clever wordplay that was done with the title of that episode, I think that the Question is another wordplay that looks like something else but in fact is asking something different.

Instead of the Question being ""Doctor Who?"" in regards to his exact name, I think that it is more about who the man that the Doctor is and how he is perceived across the universe.

I mean we've already seen River say that to the people of the Gamma Forest regard the Doctor as a ""warrior"" rather than the traditional interpretation of the name as ""healer"" and now with the last episode which states that John Hurt's Doctor was the ""one that broke the promise"", I think the Question is going to come into the foreground in the 50th because of the introduction of the ""lost"" Doctor and also because Tennant is back as well.

The reason I say this is because it is going to make the Doctor look back over his past lives and examine both the best and worst that he has been and he needs to decide how he is going to go forward.

Obviously I could be completely wrong but I thought it made sense in my head.",false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,null,null,self,Doctor Who?,13,http://www.reddit.com/r/doctorwho/comments/1fvmvl/doctor_who/

It's close to my heart. I lost two wonderful relationships due to depression (one of whom tried to commit suicide shortly after our split).  I was not in a position to be able to understand or support either at the time, it’s almost impossible to fathom if you have no understanding of it on a personal level without doing oodles of research and talking to all and sundry to thrash things out. 

I also happen to work within mental health care (for now, but this is a bit of a fluke, I’m not a professional by any means, but I do also happen to be studying psychology). 

I see a rapidly increasing number of young people slowly allowing themselves to open up a tiny bit and admit that they may have problems that they don't know how to cope with. However, the stigma of bygone years is still very much there with a lot of these youngsters (frankly, you can take your stiff British upper lip and shove it where the sun doesn’t shine!). We desperately need to do all that we can to begin to remove that stigma, because this problem is only going to continue to get worse, especially whilst our economy remains in the gutter.  A bit skeptical? [Read this]( http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/2011/mar/16/suicide-rates-northern-ireland), research the evidence and decide for yourself.  And if your immediate thought is: stress does not equal depression, I’d suggest that the former leads to the latter. 

May I throw a stat at you? Medication for mental health treatment has increased by 400% in the States in the last 10 years. Now, it's absolutely plausible that this may be down to increased awareness (the internet has been instrumental, obviously) but it *may* also suggest that things are only getting worse.  Or it could be that their doctors are med-happy because they get backhanders from the drug companies. Who knows. Their healthcare is in a very, very wrong place. However, their trends usually always come here eventually (except for the gun trend, which I don’t believe ever will).  

A letter was published in the Metro this morning (bleurgh, sorry about referring to a trash paper): Peter O'Leary wrote: 'mental health is what cancer used to be 25 years ago - the one thing that people never talked about and was pretty easy to hide.' I think he has hit the nail on the head. 

In Stephen Fry we have a national spokesperson who is brave enough to confront his problems and publicly admit to them, which obviously increases awareness, hopefully leading others to consider their own position if they feel they may need some help, and also seeing a much-admired Brit voice that ‘these things are okay to admit’ can only be advantageous. 

In our government, we have cuts in mental health care, and if you are in a VERY bad place, it may take six months until you get your first CBT session (cognitive behaviour therapy – it’s a life coping mechanism). In the meantime, you may be prescribed drugs which make you far, far worse (different reactions for different folk).  It’s still a work in progress but speaking from personal experience, seeing a friend have a complete melt-down and lose all sense of reality when on the wrong medication is not a pleasant experience. 

**TL;DR: can we send messages, share stories and pictures, postcards, thoughts, drawings, supportive messages, a packet of sweets or whatever you can commit the time to by posting something, anything to Stephen via his agent:**
