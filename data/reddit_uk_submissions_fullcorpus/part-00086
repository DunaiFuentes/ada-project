We will be there for about two weeks. We will be touring mostly the Southern areas, Scotland and Ireland.

Tips on safety? Cheap transport and accommodation would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance!

*edit* More specifics...

We'll be arriving in Gatwick on the 17th of November. We will spend a few days in that vicinity and start travelling North to Manchester which we will spend like two or three days. From there up to Scotland and then to Ireland for the remainder of time and fly back down to South Africa.

Now, for the questions, how easy and cheap is it to get across these lines?
Is cheap accommodation hard to come by? Are there backpackers and such a person could stay at? What sort of pricing can we expect?
How safe is it to travel on public transport? In SA we have to keep our eyes open all the time especially when travelling, Do we watch out for pick pockets or terrorists?
What sites outside the usual ""holiday destinations"" should we check out?

I can't divulge too much more on the trip as we're still planning everything out and was hoping to use Reddit to get some good insight travel agents can't offer.

Can't see QPR wanting me on the wage bill in the Champ.


It was a move for me that just never worked out. Sometimes that happens. I gave my all in that shirt as I always do. I made mistakes. But I never gave less then my all, regardless of internal politics. I played a part in keeping them up last year. This year, I was banished from the 1st day of pre-season training.

It's just everywhere, probably predominantly because of the reach and demographics of the internet - but also here in the UK, its been assimilating itself into our daily lives since the late 80's.

I really wish we as a nation would look more to Western European culture and ideals - but we continue to be, culturally - the 51st State of a country half the world away.

I doubt anyone would really care to read most of this but whatever, kind of feels good to get my feelings down. 

Ever since i started browsing reddit, i have always come across the gif of david tennant in the rain.  After i saw that for the millionth time i was curious just who in the hell was this guy.  i liked his face.  I dunno, he seemed nice.  I found out where he was from and after reading the synopsis of Doctor Who i decided i would give it a shot.  Having no previous knowledge of the character or mythos i was kind of irritated that this other guy was ""the doctor"".  And to be honest, the episode was kind of lame, mannequins going nuts i think.  just seemed pretty cheesy.  So i just gave up on doctor who for a couple months.  About three weeks ago i decided to give it another shot.  Got through the first episode.  But the second episode, that is where i was just blown away.  ""THIS MOTHER FUCKER CAN TRAVEL IN TIME!""  is the first thing i thought.  I believe the second episode is about the end of planet earth...sorry guys could be wrong.  But just the idea of it was awesome.  I could tell a lot of love was given into this series just by that episode.  

I fell in love with the doctor.  From that point on i was hooked.  I would watch 5 episodes back to back to back, smiling from ear to ear.  Now i had no idea about the doctors ability to change faces when he regenerated.  To be perfectly honest, i knew David was going to reprise the role at some point.  But i liked my doctor.  I didnt want him to end.  

After the realization of what Bad Wolf meant (which im still pretty fucking confused about...did rose write Bad Wolf across all of time?  what does it really mean? etc) i saw my doctor save rose, who i really grew attached to as well.  She went all over 9000 on everybody and saved captain JACK!!!!

The thing that really surprised me about the show is that they are not afraid to use enemies that were in the old series, in fact they do this a lot.  I feel if this show was American, it would have just been a ravamped version of the cybermen or the daleks, but they stayed true to their audience, and they actually made these cheesy bad guys kinda cool.  
Sorry just went off on a little tangent there

So after The doctor saved rose, i knew it was going to happen somehow... he was going to in some way change.  I was...sad.  This man brought me into this new world and i only had one season with him.  When he regenerated i didnt really know how i would take it.  Would David really pull it off?

It made me really happy that The doctor still had all his memories (i didn't know if he lost them through regeneration at the time) it made me feel like my doctor was still there.  And he was.  I am currently on season/series 4, I fucking hate Donna....but the other aspects of the show are still strong as ever for me.  I love getting lost in another galaxy for a couple hours a night.  

I really don't know what else to say, i am nervous for a new doctor, i hear you guys like him.  Everyone loves Tennant i feel, and I completely agree.  

I was talking to a friend and he said that the later seasons sort of...suck in his opinion.  He loves the Doctor, but he really dislikes the new writer with a fiery passion.  Don't know why that is, kind of nervous to find out.

In the Snowmen he took control of the snow and in TBOSJ of the Wi-fi which are two elements very different. They both allow the GI to develop a kind of web. One remark from Clara (the one about what time is made of) made me think that perhaps in the future, the GI will parasite the Time Vortex or something like that. And that would create Clara who could be many things like a trap for the Doctor (but that's too close of the whole Pandorica thing, and two times the same trick is not really likely to happen). 

Indeed, I think that Clara is, in a way, made of time itself, that she is a kind of echo spreading through time and space. Since she's made of time, it would exist a kind of core or pattern which would define the character (her being clever, her skills with computer, her being a governess, the ""run you clever boy and remember"" thing, how she looks, her name, etc...). That could explain why the TARDIS doesn't like her and shows it by not opening her doors nor translating alien languages: the TARDIS travels through the Vortex and knows all of time and space. Thus, she probably knows that Clara isn't ""a true being"", that she is time taking human form(s). If Clara is a trap for the Doctor, she might know that too. And perhaps the fact that Clara was born from the Time Vortex makes her ""unavoidable"", the TARDIS being naturally attracted by her (and not rejecting her as she did when Jack became a fixed point). That could also explain how she succeed in calling from a simple phone in 2013 to the TARDIS' one in 1207. 

Moreover, something occurred to me while watching TROA one more time: a ""simple"" leaf embodying all the time that Clara's mother would have lived got rid of the old god. But on the planet's rings, there probably is a lot of items which would have the same power, especially since people pay with psychometric things or whatever that means. So why didn't the old god die by feeding on all these objects? Maybe I'm just thinking too much about something which just plays the part of showing the power of love but maybe I'm not. What if that leaf killed the old god because it was made of time? Clara being composed of time herself, she could probably ""infuse"" time on that leaf. She could make the days non-lived by her mothers more ""real"" and give the old god a meal based on time itself, a meal to which he would probably not survive.

Also, the fact that the Doctor's phone number was given to her by somebody else (the woman in the shop who, since we don't know yet who she is, could also be an enemy even if it reminds more of Rose/River/Sally) makes me think that she has been manipulated (by the Great Intelligence? Or even the Silence?) in order to get closer to the Doctor. And that goes for his catchphrase coming from somebody else to.

I think that this could lead directly to the 50th special. We know that David Tennant and Billie Piper are coming back and I directly think that David Tennant will be the version of Tenth who stayed with Rose and not the ""true"" Tenth. Something could happen to the Time Vortex, linked to the GI and Clara, and open the gate between the universes, especially between Pete's universe and The Doctor's one. 

Well, at least that's my theory. I don't think that it's a probable one since that's Moffat and I think that he will surprise everybody since he's Moffat. But I like it and I wanted to share it in order to talk about it and to see what people think about it.

I have no savings as I'm fresh out of university. I've already borrowed from the family for this first flat, so that's out of the question. I won't be getting a deposit back from my current flat because it was a no deposit scheme. I'm maxed out on my overdraft.

Anything however that I can put skills I have garnered over the last four years studying history (research, writing &amp; critical analysis) to good use would be much appreciated, and would be rewarded with an incredibly strong work ethic, a desire to progress, and the ability to make a *perfect* cup of coffee. 

**My Experience:**I will be graduating from a UK redbrick university next month, and am well on course for a good 1st in History. I spent one year studying in the USA, so have a good grasp of American culture also, though I occasionally have to remind myself not to say 'fanny pack' now that I'm back in the UK. Indeed, spending a year at an American university has taught me the nuances of rhetoric and
grammar in written communication. For example, I learnt that the use of irregular past participles, the Oxford comma, and double consonants were all labelled as inappropriate in American formal writing. (There is a cracking joke in that sentence if you look closely!) No professional experience bar part time jobs to supplement my studies, though my hard work and trustworthiness meant that I have been entrusted with a good deal or responsibility at one of these jobs. I’ve written a number of articles for both UK and US university newspapers on a range of topics from political analysis of American primary elections to a scathing review of Costa Coffee. I was also Heady Boy at school so plenty of teamwork and leadership acumen also. 

**Skills:** Writing, research, critical analysis, teamwork, leadership, public speaking, explaining and communicating ideas clearly and succinctly. 

**About me:** I'm genuinely fascinated by historical enquiry and actually thoroughly enjoy my degree. I particularly focus on the role of media, film, literature, and music in history as I believe the examination of popular culture says as much about a past society as any historical text can. Have you ever seen the original Godzilla? - It's the best way of understanding the culture surrounding the use of the atomic bomb in Japan after WWII. Aside from the high levels of geekiness, I also enjoy good cuisine from across the world. My interest in other cultures, especially India, Japan and Latin America dovetails well with an appreciation for remarkable foods. I find the culture and history of the coffee industry fascinating, and enjoy sampling unique coffee beans sourced from small independent farmers. I cycle and run regularly and have played in Jazz bands at prestigious music venues include the Royal Albert Hall and the North Sea Jazz Festival, Holland.

I'm a Computing Science Student at the University of Aberdeen. I was wondering if you could help me out with my final-year project.

I'm building a database using data submitted by Twitter users about how they would describe the temperature outside. The idea being to be able to find out how opinions differ across the UK about what is hot, what is cold and where the lines are between them.

You're not restricted to just ""hot"" and ""cold"", you can use any word or phrase you like to describe the temperature, but it should be a description of the temperature and not the weather in general.

Tweets are mapped showing the last 6 hours worth of tweets [here](http://uktemp.net/).

You can find instructions on the map page, but if you don't want to click the link, basically you just have to tweet with the hashtag #uktemp, your postcode district (the first half of your postcode) and your description of the temperature outside right now where you are inside quotation marks. For example:

&gt; It's ""cold"" outside #uktemp AB24

You can turn it into a sensible sentence like I've done there in the example. Only the word cold will be picked up and placed in the database as it's the only word within the quotation marks.

I'll release all the data collected once the experiment has gathered enough and post a report here so you don't miss out on the results.

Greetings /r/LiverpoolFC.

I have some good news. I have managed to upload this game to a free hosting service. As the title says, 720p, English Commentators. The quality is not perfect, there are moments of digital corruption, and you may not be able to see the timestamp of the video. EDIT2: Also no game time given, can't believe I forgot that bit, sorry.

This file is over 6gb in size. In order to make the upload succeed I had to break it down into six parts, using a free compression program known as [7-zip](http://www.7-zip.org/). I tried to upload in full for ease, but after the second crash at between 4-5gb I decided it wasn't going to happen.

The video is in '.ts' format. I have found that [VLC](http://www.videolan.org/vlc/) works, however I also have [K-Lite codex](http://codecguide.com/download_kl.htm) installed so it may be necessary to have that as well. Either way, it *will* work with the correct software.

Now, on to the other side of the news. As this is a free hosting site, concurrent connections for downloading the file are limited to 6, and require a specific download key to access.

~~**I would very much like a test person or two who don't mind using 6gb of data to test this download before I release the key to the masses.** If you can help me with this, would be very much appreciated. If you would kindly reply here, or message me directly, you have my thanks.~~

The song starts with ""Rest now, my Warrior"". In ""A Good Man Goes to War"" Doctor and Warrior have the same meaning in some cultures. So it's pretty obvious that its a song about him.

&gt; Can you hear them? All these people who lived in terror of you and your judgement. All these people who's ancestors devoted and sacrificed themselves to you. 

Isn't this a perfect description of the Doctors enemies and allies? Everyone in the universe fears him, both allies and enemies fear his judgement. Enemies fear the punishment, and allies fear if he is doing the right thing. His allies devote and sacrifice themselves all the time to make sure he makes the right choice. 

&gt;Can you hear them singing? Oh, you like to think you're a god, but you're not a god. 

The Doctor, from time to time ( The Pandorica Opens, A Good Man Goes to War ) acts just like a God. But he is not a God, he can't always prevent his friends from getting hurt or eventually ""running away"" from him. 

Everyone eventually leaves him, if he was a God, he would be able to keep them alive and safe forever, but as we've seen in The Angels Take Manhattan, Asylum of the Daleks and The Snowmen, he just can't save everyone from everything, no matter how hard he tries. Even those that he managed to save ( Donna ), were harmed in some way by him.

&gt; You're just a parasite eating out the jealousy and envy and longing for the lives of others. You feed on them. On the memory of love and lost and birth and death and joy and sorrow.

Isn't this exactly what the Doctor does? He has seen everything, and has been to everywhere. The entire universe is nothing to him and to stop him from going mad, he lives through his companions, be it Rose, Marta, Donna, Ponds and now Clara. But unlike most ""baddies"", his relationships benefit his friends. The baddies don't care who they hurt. 

The Akhenaten God destroys everything that he can't have. He is envious and jealous of what others have, so he takes it from them. 

The Doctor however, try to make others happy, and by doing so, he finds happiness for himself. But he understands the scary feeling of being left alone for all eternity.

&gt; So, so come on then. Take mine. Take my memories. And I hope you've got a big appetite because I have lived a long life and I have seen a few things. I walked away from the last Great Time War. I marked the passing of the Time Lords. I saw the birth of the universe and watched as time ran out. Moment by moment until nothing remained -- no time, no space, just me. I walked in universes where the laws of physics where devised by the mind of a mad man. I watched universes freeze and creations burn. I have seen things you wouldn't believe. I have lost things you will never understand. And I know things. Secrets that must never be told. Knowledge that must never be spoken. Knowledge that will make parasite gods blaze. So come on then! Take it! Take it all, baby! Have it! You have it all!

He suffered so much... He lost so much...

But as the song says

&gt;Live! Wake up! Wake up!

&gt;And let the cloak! Of life! Cling to your bones!

And so he did. He attached himself to life ( his companions ) and they protected him, just like a cloak. They gave him Love ( River ?), Birth ( Melody Pond ) and Joy ( all the good times ). Even though loss, death and sorrow eventually came, he always choose to allow Life to ""cling to him"" so he can move on and not become a monster.

The song, is so simple, yet, it describes the Doctor so well.

&gt;Rest now…..my warrior.
&gt;Rest. My warrior.

His death, or when part of him dies. He always gets incredibly sad and depressed when he loses someone, as he should be. But he can't rest/be sad forever...

&gt;Live. Wake up. Wake up.

Wake up Doctor, wake up...

&gt;And let the cloak, of life – cling to your bones. Cling to your bones.

There is loss, but there is also life. The universe keeps spinning, stars create new life every moment. Let those life's attach to you, and keep going... keep fighting... They will protect you.

I wouldn't be surprised if we hear this song again in the future. 

From ""The Year That Never Was"" arc, we know what happens when the entire Earth thinks about the Doctor, can you imagine the entire universe doing the same?

The Doctor was known by a lot of people a few seasons ago, but that also meant that more enemies knew about him. The Pandorica arc was about his enemies joining forces and trying to stop him, and the Closing Time arc was the Doctor erasing himself from time to avoid having Pandorica 2.0. So these days, no one knows the answer to ""Doctor Who?"", no one knows who he is, and what he has done for everyone. 

But what happens when the entire universe, across time and space thinks ( or sing ) about him? At that time, everyone will know the answer to ""Doctor Who?"". When everyone thinks about him, they will know who he is.

Is the Universe really safer without people knowing about of the Doctor? If there is no Doctor to fear, then there is nothing stopping very smart, very powerful beings to make their move ( I am looking at you Great Intelligence ). 

The power of the Doctor, has always been about his allies as shown in A Good Man Goes to War. Just by hearing the Tardis sound, people knew why he was there. He didn't have to ask for their help, or explain why. They all just entered the Tardis and joined him. Everyone knew Who he was.

But what if it comes to the point, where he needs the help of the Universe, and the Universe doesn't know who he is? What if when the question is asked, there is just silence, because no one knows the answer?

Originally I was planning to do an MSc after I finished my degree and I kind of just assumed that any tuition fees or whatever would be covered by a similar loan to the one I have now and that I'd just have to reapply for a loan. However some of my friends said that to do an MSc you have to pay close to £10,000 up front and that you can't get a loan for it.

Can anyone just clear up for me how this works? Can I apply for a government loan to help me do an MSc or do I have to somehow come up with the money myself?

I live in an inner city area of Liverpool. The area we live in (which used to be a lovely area) has progressively been invaded by what I can only describe as ""scum"". Over the past 13 years we have seen off (via eviction) 4 different neighbors who have endeavored to make our lives hell after us standing up to their behavior.

To put this into perspective, at one point the shit in the house next to us **burnt their own house down** to spite and ""terrorize"" us (causing smoke damage etc as it is a terrace) and get a new house. This was after 2 years of harassment and her assaulting my mother.

We've always tried to be good citizens, we won't tolerate gangs of tracksuit-clad youths congregating outside the house, vandalism etc and It's caused us more bother than it has peace - but we stand up for our community. I wanted to join the police at one point due to my experiences with people like this - but they've effectively stopped recruiting.

We've had relative peace for about a year, but about 2 months ago another family moved in 3 houses down from us. Their kids are little bastards, and my nan (who lives with us) is very frail and was being driven mad by them kicking the football on the shutters over the road. My mum politely went out to ask them to stop and the kid (about 7) went insane (literally). Then the mother came out and started on my mum, about how the kid had autism etc. (Um, Give a fuck? Control your kid you piece of shit). The other day, my mum pulled up from work and the mad bitch started on her again.

 My experience growing up knows this is the sign of yet another struggle, and that the struggle never will end, but is constant.

2. We play a 2nd team (reaction to Coulthirst travelling with the squad), and win or lose, I'm okay with it because it means we can focus on the league, resting our star players for the toils of the league and securing Champs spots. 

3. We play our full team, and lose. And that's our season damn near finished as I see it, with exhausted, frustrated players, who can't perform in the league either. (Worst case scenario).


If I'm being brutally honest. Outcome 2 is most appealing to me. It's not that I don't appreciate the europa league, or value the impact and GLORY of winning it, but there's still a long way to go, it will severely damage our league aspirations, and will tire players without even guarantee winning. I think we're better off with losing against Basel, and focusing.

One of the short stories involves examining the war in Indochina (Vietnam) from a British perspective – essentially with that timeline’s British in the role of our timeline’s Americans.  The main character in that short story writes a book critical of their presence in the war, and Brigadier Lethbridge-Stewart is quoted in the British media as being critical of the book.

It’s just a throwaway reference, and not worth picking up just for the reference unless the premise of the anthology itself interests you, but I thought I’d mention it in case it was of interest to anyone.  (Thus far, it's a rather good read.)

The authors of this anthology incorporated other fictional characters as “real” cameos -- such as the husband and wife from the 1934 W.C. Fields film “It’s a Gift”.  And one short story centers around an urban legend named Tom Joad, presumably the *Grapes of Wrath* character.

The past 3 games he has played I found myself yelling at the screen. ""FUCKING MOVE, STURRIDGE"" or ""PRESS DANNY, DON'T JUST STAND THERE""

It doesn't help that he plays along side one of the hardest working players in the league, but I feel that out of the whole team, he is the only one with this lame attitude. Even Assaidi busts his ass when he gets a few minutes.

On the flip side, Suarez's skill and workrate, with the addition of Couthino and the rise of henderson mean that Suarez is no longer needed in the 10 role. I think Rodgers agrees with me and thats why Suarez played striker against West Ham. 

So I'm going to call this right now. I don't think Sturridge will be in the side against Reading. I think our front four will be Suarez, Coutihno, Downing, and Hendo.

Sturridge will get better, I have no doubt. but he really has a poor attitude at the moment.

 I loved the show when it returned in 2006. But when 11 took over, well, I'll summarise my problem - Every episode leaves questions unanswered, the tone makes it seem like it's always the finale, and there don't seem realistic consequences. An example of the finale thing - In the first episode of series 6, The Doctor dies. An example of the consequences thing - 'The Doctor's death is a fixed point, he must always die', except when he finds a way out of it. 
I much preferred 9 and 10's style - Each episode (or 2-part episode) is independant with very subtle hints towards the series finale.

If there are a lot of questions I can get her to respond.


Why was Thatcher the longest serving Prime Minister of the twentieth century? And why is the Queen going to her funeral, when she didn’t go to any of the other Prime Ministers’ who died during her reign? What was her secret?

I would say she had a gut instinct about what it meant to be (white) British which many voters of all classes, plus the Queen probably, shared. In this, she was much closer to the electorate than the Left, who hated her nationalistic bombast, her divide-and-rule policies, and her clear instinct for vicious, ‘take no prisoners’ style.  She talked about the Armed Forces and Great Britain in a way that both the upper middle class and the working class, who make up the ranks, understood. It was about patriotism, sacrifice for a cause, national pride, honour from past victories, and for the camaraderie of men when up against a shared enemy. She stood for Nelson, the Duke of Wellington and Churchill. (It’s a pity Attila the Hun and Napoleon weren’t British.) Great leaders, who led from the front and who did not have to explain themselves, was the image Thatcher projected and her followers loved her for it. 

Thatcher chose her followers well. They were the decent British, hard-working people, ordinary men and women, standing on their own two feet, being careful and thrifty, but also having the wit to ‘get on’ in life, getting a bit more money and trading up, even if it was only for a better suite of furniture or a family car. How on earth was Thatcher able to replace Labour’s magnificent post-war emancipation struggle for equality and justice with this insipid notion of individualistic ‘aspiration’?  I don’t know quite how she did it, but it was spot on. Her clarion call reverberated deep in the heart of traditional Britishness, which she seemed to understand instinctively.  

These were ‘her’ people: the ones to whom she offered council houses at a discount, so as to make a property owning democracy in her own, radical  Conservative image. It was the biggest privatisation of all, transferring £17.5 billion from a public investment into private hands. Not a penny was re-invested in new housing, creating an almost continuous housing bubble, based on scarcity. From April 2013, we have begun to turn people out of council houses if they’ve got too many bedrooms and can’t afford to pay for the extra space. Housing benefit needs ‘capping’ because of the austerity policies of Cameron’s Conservative alliance. But it never went to the tenants in the first place. It went into the pockets of private housing associations and private landlords. It is their profits that need capping. But this would be intervening in the market and smacks of ‘socialism’ – and Thatcher’s stopped such talk long ago.

She knew without a shadow of a doubt what kind of country we are : ‘Great’. It was a hopelessly outdated construction but it worked for many people. We were good at wars and it never harmed to have one on the go. Tony Blair understood this and followed her lead. But she set in motion a way of looking at ourselves which has led British culture into dire straits, rudderless and fearful, with no real values to underpin its future struggle for a better society. Even the BBC has fallen from grace; politicians, journalists and bankers hit rock bottom some time ago. Thatcher is to blame for setting all this in motion. 

People like me hated Thatcher on sight, or rather on hearing: that appallingly inauthentic voice, all elocution lessons and borrowed upper-class vowels.  She was not a team player, but a one-woman band, banging her drum and tooting her horn: her only tune was that there was only one way, and it was her way. The Conservative Party could not quite believe what they had done, but once the Kraken had been unleashed, no-one was able to control her. She took over, held sway and won elections! The Conservatives, always a pragmatic lot, which is another way of saying unprincipled, grew to like their monster and kept her for as long as was convenient.

But for us on the Left, it was the miners’ strike that brought her true purposes into focus.  My partner’s relatives had been, over a hundred year period, coal miners in the South Wales, Derbyshire, South Yorkshire and Kent coalfields, (at least the working class were geographically if not socially mobile, usually because they were desperate) . So when the miners’ strike erupted, something quite spontaneous inspired us to take up arms. We did all the solidarity things, went on marches, attended meetings, collected money. We watched appalled as unarmed men were chased by baton- wielding police on horseback (not from the same areas as the miners, but Southerners). We noted how all the TV shots of police violence during the strike were made from the police’s point of view and how Thatcher talked of the ‘enemy within’. We travelled to Kent to meet an uncle who had been black-listed as a militant and unlikely to work ever again. He died before his time.

I was born and bred in Sheffield and we watched appalled as its steel industry was destroyed. Thatcher decided that nationalised industries should no longer be subsidised and thousands of steel jobs, the backbone of the city for a hundred and fifty years, were lost at a stroke.  Not that it wasn’t back-breaking work in appallingly hot, unbearably noisy and dangerous conditions.  My dad started labouring in the steel works when he arrived in Sheffield after being demobbed in 1947. But he couldn’t stand it and left for the railways. As kids we sometimes stood at the gates in Neepsend and watched men in the semi-dark cathedral of the works, skilfully handling the red-hot ingots with long-handled pincers, swinging them through the rollers, sparks flying everywhere. It was the only work available in these parts, and suddenly the gates were closed. 

The city was in shock for months. How could anyone treat Englishmen like this? Working-class men lost everything that they held dear: their pride in a tough job, needing bravery and endurance, and done without complaint; their sense of everyone being in it together, an egalitarian conviction that every man was no better than the next; their status as a reliable breadwinner who had earned his children’s right to a decent education and the NHS. It’s true there were not many feminists in their midst. Women’s ability to hold together a family on low wages, in poor housing (outside toilets and no bathrooms persisted in Sheffield well into the sixties), and do what paid work they could lay their hands on for half the wages of men, was totally taken for granted. But there weren’t many more feminists in other classes either.  

So Thatcher, by 1983, was clear what she was against and was good at economic destruction. Within three years she was one of the most unpopular PMs in post-war history.  How did she climb back? It was a bit hit and miss. She covered up her lack of economic ideas by selling off the family silver, bit by bit.  It was called ‘privatisation’ . British Gas, British Airways, British Steel, British mines, British shipbuilding, British water, British North Sea gas all went to the highest bidder. The latter was the greatest folly. Norway decided to spend their profits from their North Sea windfall by investing in the social fabric of society. They sold none of the gas reserves for immediate profit. Now the country is regularly judged to be the most secure, successful and equal country in which to live, with few of the social ills born out of the ever- widening inequality which we have to endure. Thatcher did the exact reverse. She wasn’t going to follow the path of ‘socialist’ Norway. She invested nothing and cashed in our gas reserves to lower taxes and buy votes. Now we have to buy gas from Russia and are  the second most unequal society of the minority developed world. Only the US is worse. Thank you Margaret Thatcher.

She followed this brand of recklessness, with another. She de-regulated the trading rules in the City without any safeguards, and sowed the seeds for the growth of the super-rich banking and financial class.  The whole British economy became skewed towards the globalised financial industries for the next thirty years and their vast, unethical, fraud-prone business led the UK and the rest of the global system almost into oblivion in 2008. Ordinary wages had  stagnated for years. New jobs were low paid, unregulated and insecure. Yet, the country still remains mesmerised by the City’s wealth- making- machine- that-was, and is doing very little to find a radical solution to the whole sorry mess. It is only quantitative easing which is keeping the shebang on the road and one day there will be a final reckoning.  Perhaps Thatcher will then, at last, be seen for what she was – a deluded power hungry autocrat, who led the country to eventual financial ruin.

But then, people say, what about the fact that she was the First Woman Prime Minister. That must be worth some celebration. No actually. She was no feminist, it rhymed with communist for a start.  It was another of those hated movements which asked people to put aside their individual desires and work for the common good, in this case liberation from a male dominated system of power. But Thatcher didn’t want to be liberated thank you very much. She had made it to the top, and she was a woman, so there you are – if she had done it, why shouldn’t everybody else? It didn’t matter that she had no other woman in the Cabinet. Clearly there was none good enough. If you had an Oxford degree , an enormous narcissistic ego,  a millionaire husband, and the energy and instinct of a tiger, you could make it too. If you didn’t, you only had yourself to blame. You certainly dare not blame ‘society,’ which had been abolished somewhere along the line as some made-up sociological nonsense. Structural barricades such as age-old inequalities of class, gender, race, ethnicity, caste, disability, sexuality, were miraculously swept away as irrelevant and woe betide anyone claiming they had been hard done by.

By 1989, there had been riots in several cities (‘criminality plain and simple’ was Thatcher’s response), the IRA were up in arms like never before, bombing the mainland, including her and her entourage, and going on hunger strike in the Maze prison . Her response? ‘Pure criminality, plain and simple’ and ‘let them die’, so they did. Lastly came the ‘poll tax’ up-rising and charges by the police on horse-back  in Trafalgar Square  (‘criminality, plain and simple’ – not the police of course, the protesters) . We’d already had the Falklands war that not even the hair-brained President Reagan would support. I don’t know if Galtieri, the Argentinian president and arch enemy, was a criminal, pure and simple but I wouldn’t be surprised. Meanwhile, she had given her personal support to the fascist, Pinochet, and the apartheid regime in South Africa. At least she could say she was consistent. The Kraken was getting out of hand and I haven’t even mentioned Europe, or the self-inflation to Royal status when she announced, ‘we are a grandmother’. By 1991, she had served her purpose and had to be chained up again, down at the bottom of the sea preferably. The Conservative Party hierarchy obliged and we could breathe once more. How were we to know she would stalk the land up to this very day?

I am a student at a university in Colorado, about to finish up my junior year. Out of the blue, I was offered a place in our international student exchange program and decided to apply. I was shocked and angry that I was not accepted into any of the schools that I applied to. Then, about a month later, I got a call saying that one school got my application late and wanted my attendance! So now I will be attending the University of Ulster after this summer!

I am very excited. But, as someone who has never lived outside of his home state let alone ever been outside of the country, I am a bit uncharacteristically nervous.So I am hoping to ask you Redditors of Ireland, what I might come across or should expect while I'm there. And if there is any advice that you might have for an American in your county, I would love to here it. In case anyone wants to know, I do not know which campus I will be at, but I am expecting to be placed in either Jordanstown or Belfast, Northern Ireland.
Thank you for the advice!

Please understand that I am not trying to whore myself out for karma or have anyone ""Fill my itinerary"" for me.( I got some flack for not mentioning that in a different thread.) I just want to get an idea of what its like over there before I come. My goal is to make friends, and I just want to be sure that I don't accidentally offend anyone.

Specifically, that theory, which I subscribed to up until now, was that a lack of exposure to the TARDIS was why not all of the alien languages were translated for Clara. However, I was watching The Christmas Invasion and noticed that, where the translation circuits weren't helping anyone understand the Sycorax while the Doctor was in a regenerative coma, the second the Doctor was back to 100% it worked for everyone. And I mean EVERYONE. Harriet Jones and her aide, who have never been on the TARDIS, are gifted with the understanding of Sycoraxic along with the time travelers. After thinking about it, the exposure argument only came up later when Rory was able to understand alien language in the absence of the TARDIS and River explained to him that prolonged exposure allowed him retain the ability in the absence of the TARDIS. So this would seem to indicate that it couldn't be Clara's short exposure time to the TARDIS since she was still in its presence and should have worked anyway.

This is sport, this is football and here's how it works. Spurs have match tommorow. Spurs will show up with their full squad and give their all to triumph in this match. And then, regardless of that outcome, Spurs will play again next week, the particular competition is irrelevant, and again they will field the best they have on that day and go for it all. The same the next week, and the next etc. 

The point is that this whole Top 4 V EL is a very media and hype driven argument that we are doing nothing but fueling and causing ourselves worry and stress over. The two are in no way mutually exclusive and frankly have very little effect on each other contrary to what seems to be the opinion around these parts.

We all know there's those that play the system, and they know how not to get caught.

However, while we have so many people going for every job, lets say until we knock a million off the unemployment figures, and a REAL million, not just a million on training programmes, workfare or sanctions, but a million back into work, we try my plan?

Let those people claim their benefits unharrassed, if they agree to 16 hours a week of volunteer and community work. Of course, it doesn't stop them looking for work, but it DOES mean that they can choose to actually be useful members of society, instead of copypasting a CV to fifty companies just to make Sun readers feel like they're having to do something for their dole money.

Of course, should the job market recover, and we actually need these people working and there's positions for them, great, we'll recall them, but for now, how about allowing them work in charity shops, community projects, cleaning up green spaces, etc, without the demands of 7 hours a day jobseeking when you've seen all there is to see after half an hour most days?

I partly approve of this because I put my most recent job down to my volunteer work, the experience, the networking, and the habit of going out and doing stuff each day, and not the mindless tedium of applying for jobs I'm not suited for just to hit some arbitary target.

We see the Doctor watch the 'leaf serendipity.' He's flipping the pages of a comic book (""Beano"" specifically). Maybe the Doctor interfered with the leaf falling? He turns a page of the comic prior to the Leaf falling. It's suggestive, considering that it is a comic book about shenanigans.

To this end, the possibilities of the Leaf imply the possibility/necessity of the Doctor, the man who 'ordained' the happening. I imagine the Doctor knew that if he initiated the meeting of Clara's parents, her mother would die an untimely death.

(2013 christmas special, The Snowmen)
And I have decided to throw my hat in as to her origin, 
more specificly as to why there are multiple versions of her
Across space and time.
I believe that the Clara from The Bells of St. John, and the rings of Ahkotan are the originaly occuring Clara for two reasons.
One, when she remembers the Doctor at her mom funeral she asks why he was there, and he states that she reminds him of someone else, I believe she was telling the truth, for the simple fact that she is ordinary(he checked, thats why he went back)
Therefore I say say that this one is the original. 
Two, she got the upgraded computer hacking skills in The bells, and such, having given her the unnatural talents that defeated and attracted her from the Daleks in The Asylum of the Daleks. In this version it was a mystery as to how she gained such unnatural knowledge and just kind of left that unanswered.
Three, this is part of my conclusion, and mostly conjecture as to what will happen, and why it did happen, pay attention this part gets tricky. 
In season five finale The Big Bang, with the Ponds and song we find a dying older Amelia with her younger self in and out of The Pandorica. 
The light/energy of the pandorica is just barely enough to keep the universe running, using the few atoms and particles from the exhibit as both a template for reality(how it should be) and a transmitter.
Four, this is the final part. I conclude that Clara Prime(as I will refer to her) will find herself in the future(who's to say how far, a day, a month, a billion years) with the universe dying, and all of existence dissolving into nothing for some Moffit oriented reason(fuck that guy) and she will have to donate herself as some sort of reality template as a means of telling the universe what it is supposed to be(think of using a startup disk for your computer) So then Clara has to die, but in her sacrifice, existence either by chance or choice, keeps accidentally spitting out another version of Clara across space and time, forcing The Doctor to relive her beautiful sacrifice over and over again killing him with guilt(hopefully not literally). And with her last breath she says ""Run you clever boy""
Five I saw a recent theory that believes she might also be the little girl in the library of the vashta nerada, I feel this coincides rather well with my theory.

Sorry for the bad Grammar, I wrote this on my phone.

You are the lowest of the low. There are hundreds, if not thousands of people who are passionate about their club and may never get another chance to see Liverpool play in their city. You have stolen the opportunity for those people to see their club for the sake of a small profit. 

You disgust me. 

I personally am on limited income and supporting the medical expenses of a chronically ill girlfriend. I don't have the money to pay $400-$500 for a mid tier ticket and there are many of us in these  circumstances. There is desire, but the means have been stripped away. 

I don't expect any scalpers to read this, and I don't expect them to care. But I hope one day the weight of stealing peoples life long dreams away from them catches up to you, and I hope that weighs heavy on you if you are a scalper reading this. 

You can blame disinterested ticketing outlets for failing to stamp out the issue of scalping, but the issue is not caused by them. The issue is caused by greed and avarice. You can justify the behaviour by claiming you aren't the only one, but who begrudges a group of fans buying tickets to see their team? Not I. I do begrudge you your measly grubby profit. 

I hope you can live with being a source of misery to many people time and time again.

[This short video explains the concept.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=SBFC3GJ5VM8#!)

How does it work

John in England needs to send money to Norway whilst unknown to him Ragnar in Norway wants to send money to England (this is a simplistic explanation but its just for illustrative puposes)

Ordinarily John and Ragnar are going to go to their bank or login online and set up an international bank Payement/transfer. Here is where the unfairness starts.  There is going to be a charge for doing this 
A sepa transfer from my bank Barclays is charged at 15 pounds.  

 So if you wanted to send 200 pounds from the uk to Norway you are immediately paying a 30 percent charge to do this.   This is before you take exchange rates into account. 

 Banks set their own rate.  

It is a reflection of the rate that international currency traders on the forex market use  in that it will go up and down based on that, but invariably is 3-5 percent different in the banks favour so they make another 3-5 percent at your expense there.

So john has 200uk pounds to send to a friend in Norway but his friend is only going to see 175 when we take charges and exchange rate profit from the bank..

200 – 15 (barclays charge) = 185

5 percent of 185 (loss due to inflated exchange rate)= 9.25

185-9.25  = 175.25   John has lost 24.75 or just under 24%  , obviously as the amount John sends increases , the loss in percentage terms increases since 15 pounds transfer fee as a percentage of say 1000 is 1.5 percent.   But he’lll still be hit by the 5 percent and that is where a service like transferwise comes in.

The rate they use  is based on the real  international exchange rate as found on yahoo.finance, etc etc, not the rate Barclays choose to use.  And they use what is called the mid market rate which basically and average of the buy and sell price , so it’s fair.
How can they beat the banks then?

By crowdsourcing.   In the simplified version of our example , they have an account in the uk and one in Norway.  So john pays his 200 into transferwise’s uk bank account .  Ragnar sends his 15 kronur to transferwises norweigan account.  

So tranferwise pay johs recipient in Norway with ragnars money and pays Ragnars recipient in uk with Johns money, thereby avoiding an international transfer of money. Simples.  Transferwise get a .5 percent for acting as middleman.

SEVENTH - Lady Peinforte, either purposefully or unwittingly asks The First Question in her final confrontation with the Doctor in Silver Nemesis. She threatens ""Doctor Who?, have you never wondered where he came from?"". She refers to a time of chaos and the ""old time"" which may refer to a time without Time Lords AND she has a statue called Nemesis - but does not reveal whos Nemesis it actually is (she claims ownership of it ""My Nemesis"", so it cannot actually be her own nemesis). It is of Time Lord manufacture and tied to the Doctor and we know that ""The Doctor Lies"".

THIRD - the Master was originally going to be revealed as a manifestation of the dark side of the Doctors ID (nope I'm not going for the Master)

FOURTH/FIFTH - in order to prevent his regeneration from failing the Watcher is sent a few days back in time to aid the fourth Doctor. He is a construct between the fourth and fifth Doctors. It is not revealed who or what created the Watcher (although a similar construct appeared for the Abbot in Planet of the Spiders to aid his regeration).

TENTH - the Doctor begins to regenerate but forces the regeneration energy into a ""handy bioreceptical"" (or something like that) creating another Doctor. Although this is NOT the actual Doctor, if you count all the Doctors that have appeared, he is the 11th and the actual 11th is the 12th.

ELEVENTH -(who is in one manner of counting the TWELTH) - is informed that at the ""Fall of the eleventh"" a quesion will be asked and the reply will have to be given.  IE, the Doctor will regenerate AND be forced to reveal his true identidy.

SIXTH... The Valeyard is a reflection of the dark side of the Doctor (like the original plan for the Master) manufactured by the Time Lords (like Nemesis) midway between his ""Twelth and Final incarnation"" (like the Watcher / the Abbot). With the reality-shaking effects of the Time War on the Daleks, it is unlikely that the Time Lords would have permitted the Daleks to even consider their plan to obliterate all of reality (so the Tenth Doctor would not have been exterminated / the second tenth would not have existed) - the ""12th-13th regeneration is now possibly the ""11th-12th"" regeneration... if this is true, the Valeyard would have been manufactured on the Fields of Trenzalore....

.... Who is the Doctor; The Doctor is the Valeyard.

Words: Tony Barrett


As has been the case throughout their 24-year struggle for justice, the Hillsborough families and their supporters kept their dignity in the wake of Margaret Thatcher’s death. “I don’t have any feelings about her either way,” was the diplomatic offering of Margaret Aspinall, whose 18-year-old son, James, was one of the 96 victims of British football’s worst disaster.

Margaret could have said many things. She could have been vindictive. She could even have welcomed Thatcher’s passing. But as a mother who knows only too well the pain and anguish of death, she also recognised that this was not the time for any of that. Instead, tact and diplomacy took precedence as her innermost thoughts remained private.

There was something else as well, though, an expression of frustration that Thatcher’s exact role in the cover-up that followed Hillsborough is still to be established. “We know she had sly meetings the evening of the disaster and the morning after at the ground and that is when the cover-up started,” Margaret said.

Sheila Coleman, of the Hillsborough Justice Campaign (HJC), went a step farther. “The HJC hope that now she is dead at least those who have protected her will do the decent thing and release all documentation in respect of the Hillsborough cover-up,” she said. “Thatcher was instrumental in the Hillsborough cover-up. We call on the Government to release all documentation about her involvement.”

For anyone tempted to suggest that such requests are ill timed or opportunistic, don’t. The Hillsborough families have waited far too long for full disclosure and those who were involved in what was described by Michael Mansfield QC as “the biggest cover-up in British legal history” are either dying off or reaching the stage of their lives when being held to account becomes increasingly unlikely. The justice clock is ticking. There is no more time to waste.

Even more pertinently, a fortnight before Thatcher’s death, John Glover, whose 20-year-old son Ian perished on the Leppings Lane death trap, passed away following a brave battle with cancer. Meanwhile, Anne Williams, who lost her 15-year-old son Kevin in the tragedy, is spending her remaining days in a hospice having had terminal bowel cancer diagnosed. The plights of John and Anne highlight exactly why time is of the essence where the full truth about Hillsborough is concerned.



That Thatcher’s involvement in the aftermath of Hillsborough remains clouded in mystery is wholly unsatisfactory and unacceptable. It had been hoped that the release of the Hillsborough Independent Panel’s report into the disaster last September would shed light on her activities but such optimism went unrewarded and the grey areas remain.

Twelve months earlier, the Information Commissioner had ruled that discussions involving Thatcher should be made public at the earliest possible opportunity. Crucially, though, details of the briefing given to her and Douglas Hurd, the then Home Secretary, on the morning after Hillsborough were not disclosed. It was also claimed that there was no documentation relating to her visit to the stadium the following day.

As such, there is still too much that we do not know about what the Prime Minister of the day thought and said about a tragedy that cost so many lives and changed the face of English football. In the absence of that information, it is inevitable that those affected by Hillsborough feel that the whole truth is yet to emerge even though so many steps have been taken towards that aim during the past year.

Equally inevitably, particularly given the extremes that instruments of the state went to in an attempt to subvert justice, the vacuum that has been created has led to conspiracy theories, the main one being that Thatcher’s role has been suppressed in order to protect her and the office that she served.

There will be those who believe that to be far-fetched. Those who don’t should consider this – one of the few things that we know for sure is that she succeeded in distorting her government’s response to the findings of the interim report into the disaster by Lord Justice Taylor out of a misplaced desire to protect South Yorkshire Police.

We know this because in a handwritten note in the margin of a civil servant’s memo informing her that Hurd planned to welcome Taylor’s findings, she wrote that this amounted to “a devastating criticism” of the police. “What do we mean by ‘welcoming the broad thrust of the report?’” she asked. “The broad thrust is devastating criticism of the police. Is that for us to welcome? Surely we welcome the thoroughness of the report and its recommendations – M.T.”

If a Primer Minister is ready, willing and able to go to such lengths to protect the state, then surely it isn’t beyond the realms of possibility that the very same state would go to the same lengths to protect her? It took 23 years for an establishment conspiracy to come to light so why would anyone believe it impossible for steps to have been taken to prevent the stench of the cover-up from infecting those at the very top?

We also know that in the aftermath of the disaster, two of Thatcher’s favourite attack dogs, Bernard Ingham (her press secretary) and Kelvin MacKenzie (her favourite newspaper editor, who this week described the former PM as “a revolutionary who made a fantastic difference to this country”) played crucial roles in warping the public’s perception of Hillsborough.

Under his infamous headline “The Truth”, MacKenzie ensured that The Sun’s coverage of the events at Hillsborough fitted in with the black propaganda that was spewing out of South Yorkshire Police. For his part, Ingham claimed the disaster had been caused by “a tanked-up mob” of Liverpool fans. He later admitted to having his opinions shaped by the same police officers who briefed Thatcher, including Peter Wright, the then chief constable of the police force.

The possibility remains that Thatcher never got her hands dirty; that she didn’t need to because her minions were doing the dirty work on her behalf. It seems highly unlikely, though, that one of the most powerful politicians of the last century limited her involvement to a scribbled note in the margin of a piece of foolscap.

This is why the time has come for the exact role that Thatcher played following Hillsborough to be made public. It is the very least that the Hillsborough families and their supporters deserve. On Monday, they will gather to commemorate the 24th anniversary of the disaster and they will do so in possession of most, but not all, of the truth about how their loved ones perished and how the state responded. That has to change.

“Somebody fed those lies, I think she was part of it and she knew about it,” Margaret Aspinall said. Given the instincts of the Hillsborough families have been proven to be right on every other issue relating to the disaster, it would be foolish in the extreme to dismiss the idea that they are wrong to suspect Margaret Thatcher.",false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,null,null,self,Now is the time to reveal truth about Thatcher’s response to Hillsborough - Tony Barrett (The Times),57,http://www.reddit.com/r/LiverpoolFC/comments/1c4mjn/now_is_the_time_to_reveal_truth_about_thatchers/

Anyway, I am too young to remember Thatcher, but I have grown up with the results of her policies and was surprised to see the vitriol after her death.

I have personally researched reputable sources to find and bring together why so many people have strong feelings against her and the facts (or links to resources with the facts) surrounding those reasons.

It's been useful for me just to get an idea of why her death has led to such an outpouring of emotion, positive and negative. Perhaps it'll be of interest to others...

Premier League results go both our ways, until we find ourselves in a dead heat for 3rd, the Scum trailing behind after a sorry result at Fulham (sorry, but they'll walk over Norwich).

Then come the semifinal ties: Chelsea get through on away goals, luckily, as the damn officials on the line finally do something, calling off a Dirk Kuyt ""goal.""

The mighty Tottenham come through after a dominant display up north, allowing the youngins some time to shine under the floodlights at the Lane (with Shaq finding the scoresheet on his first team debut).

So that settles it: Tottenham against Chelsea in the land of mayo fries and hash brownies [6].

But what's that?  We're neck and neck in the table after the weekend and leading into our pivotal midweek match?  ""No, turkeysandwiches, you're killing me!""

Well, you asked for it by reading this much already..

The match is one of the most anticipated in the history of the Premier League, nearly outweighing the final day of last season. Especially as Arsenal are now in touching distance only, two points back.

""Well, how does it end?""  I'll tell you, don't worry!

0-0.  Dull, tense and sad.  Sorry, everyone.  But no time to fret, yids; we're three ahead of the Gooners and level with the Blues.

At the weekend, we destroy a sorry Stoke City side and send Tony Pulis and his ball cap down to the Championship where they belong.  Chelsea have drawn their previous match, but go on to win the FA Cup (sigh) at the weekend.  Arsenal happens to capitulate and draw their match, leaving us ahead of Woolwich for the first time since the mid-90s and only needing a point on the final day home to Sunderland to secure 3rd.

But the land of canals and bicycles awaits.

The pomp and circumstance are out in full force for an all-England final, with AVB as dapper and Rafa portly as ever.  So it begins...

Then it ends (because I've written enough already).

2-2 (4-2).

And who's lifting that tanker of silverware after seeing the final spot kick go in..

Our favorite Yorkshireman, Michael Dawson.  Dapper fellow, that lad:  a fine captain and a true club hero.

Chelsea win their final match, but who cares!  We best Sunderland 3-1 and kindly accept our free pass into the Champions League group stages.  AVB goes to Stamford Bridge and poop cup's John Terry's locker.  Happy days and roll on the long, and finally painless summer.

Reasons:

* Cheaper than Chiltern Railways, think it's about seven pounds for a travel card. Means you can see more of London if you wish to do so after.

*  Takes the same amount of time. 

* Parking is only three/four pounds a day, I believe this is the cheapest on the Metropolitan line.

* Goes to Wembley Park Station which is only a short walk from the Stadium. Wembley Central is a slog IMO and the Chiltern Railways line takes ages. 

* The Met line has a regular service to match demand so quickish (relatively) queue times if you have a timely exit

If you want to drink a bit before the game. Then park in Gerrard's Cross (park in the car park opposite Marks and Spencers, obscure entrance) and take the Chiltern Railways in as there is a nice variety of pubs/bars/bistros on the high street and you can walk to the station.

* Most City Fans (generalization for convenience up ahead) will probably take the M6 then the M40 down to london. Ickenham/Gerrard's Cross are both five minutes off the M40. Ickenham is in fact further on, when it becomes the A40.

* Cheaper than Chiltern Railways, think it's about seven pounds for a travel card. Means you can see more of London if you wish to do so after, instead of having to buy two separate tickets.

* Takes the same amount of time (approx) as the Chiltern Railways

* Parking is only three/four pounds a day, I believe this is the cheapest on the Metropolitan line.

* Goes to Wembley Park Station which is only a short walk from the Stadium. Wembley Central is a slog IMO and the Chiltern Railways line takes ages.

* The Met line has a regular service to match demand so quickish (relatively) queue times if you have a timely exit


If you want to drink a bit before the game. Then park in Gerrard's Cross (park in the car park opposite Marks and Spencers, obscure entrance) and take the Chiltern Railways in as there is a nice variety of pubs/bars/bistros on the high street and you can walk to the station.

Good luck and hopefully it is a good game!

Source: Use these stations for most things, live in the area. Has probably saved my hours of my life and hassle and pounds over the years.

We're just 1 win away from the semi-final!

Who do you want to see playing? With the weekend game rearranged I don't think there is any reason to rest anyone.

I was really impressed with the way we played in the last 15mins against Everton, so I'd quite like to see that team, but with Dembele in for Dempsey (I assume Friedel will be playing):

Second, I am graduating in less than two weeks and my parents just surprised me today with a ticket to London for whatever game I want to see. I live in Ohio in the US, so this is huge for me. This is going to be my first time in London, England and I was hoping you guys could answer some questions for me.

I have an account at www.tottenhamhotspur.com and I will buy tickets through that, but what area should I look for in terms of seating? I'm trying to end up in a corner or behind a goal, the half line just isn't for me. 

I made a promise when I started following Spurs in 2008, that I would get a tattoo in England if I ever went over and saw a game. Since that's just a few weeks away now do any of you have any recommendations on where I could get quality ink done?

Thats really the two biggest ones I can think of right now, I am just kinda overwhelmed with this since it always seemed like a distant dream to me and now its just randomly a few weeks away.

I understand that tickets go on sale to the general public on April 29th but I'm wondering how hard it is to obtain tickets to the game? I know that they are sold to members beforehand, do they usually sell out the stadium at that point? I'd rather purchase directly from the Chelsea website, but if anyone knows any reputable re-sellers that re-sell the tickets, that would be great.

Also, not sure the time &amp; time zone when they release tickets on April 29th, anyone have an idea?

As for similarities... 

* Victoria first meets the doctor when she's taken captive by the Daleks.

* Then they fight Snowmen,

* Then they fight Ice Warriors.

* And in the end, Victoria settles on Earth in the 20th century and establishes a computer college to fight the Great Intelligence.

* Victoria's mother, Edith Rose dies on November 23.


This BLEW MY MIND. I want to know what the rest of you think... am I onto something or am I insane? 


EDIT: Some additional thoughts...provided by my brilliant friend Averie....

&gt;What if Clara is a product of the Great Intelligence.

&gt;Something created to lure the Doctor out.

&gt;And, as the Great Intelligence has the power to time travel, the power to take on any shape, possess bodies AND has great power webs - he could be manipulating the Universe to produce Claras across time.

&gt;the Great Intelligence possessed the 2nd doctor.
AND...if GI can take on any shape, what if the Great Intelligence - which we know feeds on memories and feelings...was actually the God of Akhaten.

&gt;And the doctor is feeding his memories to it. One would certainly be of Clara. And another of Victoria.

&gt;Which the Great Intelligence would recognize.

&gt;Because, we know the GI thinks the Doctor is puny.  He said as much.

&gt;But, I wonder if the idea is to get him out of the way. To lure him out and dispose of him.

&gt;Additionally, it could explain why the TARDIS isn't working for Clara. Why it doesn't like her. AND why she keeps appearing, but only in times where a WEB OF CONNECTING THOUGHTS is present.
Asylum.
Snowmen.
Bells.
And Akhaten.

&gt;I think, ulitmately, Clara doesn't know she's being used BECAUSE also If she's anything like Victoria Waterfield...
which I think the GI is purposely trying to mimic... she was used by the GI - but she didn't know.
And in the end, Victoria ends up being key to GI's destruction.

&gt;I also think, in giving the leaf to that god in Akhaten didn't destroy the god OR get rid of it.
I think it was the GI and it got what it needed - info on all of the possibilities of Clara to recreate her.
So, it left.",false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,null,null,self,Victoria Waterfield - 2nd Doctors companion...And there are a lot of parallels between her and Clara.,43,http://www.reddit.com/r/doctorwho/comments/1c5ols/victoria_waterfield_2nd_doctors_companionand/

The email address on the invoice is not even either, it's my gmail address with some numbers added onto it. 

What's more is that I couldn't have ordered the work done as I've been in China for the past 6 weeks!

I'm a little scared that this is a case of identity theft and I have emailed the company explaining that they have made a mistake, so hopefully I can resolve this. But I could really use some help and advice in this matter. Thanks

I've been to a few job interviews over the past few weeks but didn't really give them my all as I wasn't too keen on the jobs, however I would really like to get through this one. The interview consists of an ""assessment,"" and if I pass that I will be invited for a shadowing/interview session.

I'm not sure what to expect for an assessment so was wondering if any of you guys could give me an idea. The email I was sent states:

&gt;You will take part in several tasks that reflect various aspects of this position.

As this is a customer service based role specialising in (I guess) talking about fish a lot, what kind of things can I expect? What tasks can and have been given to potential employees in the customer service area?

&gt;You will also be required to take part in a team challenge.

Again, I have NO idea what this might consist of (unless you count the Apprentice style scenarios I keep going over in my head), so it would be a great help if I had just an inkling of what kind of team challenges I might face.

&gt;Please bring with you and object that you feel best describes your personality.

OK. What on earth is the interviewer looking for in this task? What might be expected as an item to bring? And what might I be expected to say about it/do with it?

Thanks in advance for any suggestions. I have not had to perform for this kind of interview before so any knowledge of what to expect would help out a great deal. Also very welcome are any suggestions of what the interviewer will be expecting of me in each task, what skills or attributes might they be looking for?

I want to state that I'm not writing this to troll the subreddit, or offend anyone.  I genuinely don't understand what people like about Rose.  To me, she is the least interesting and least useful companion in the entire new Who.  She has practically no personality, the only problems she ever solves are ones she caused in the first place, and why 10 seems to be a bit in love with her is mystifying to me.

In comparison, we have Martha (the discussion thread on her triggered this post), Donna, Wilfred, the Ponds, and Clara.  I'll go through my feelings on each in turn.

Martha as mentioned in the discussion thread on her, starts as a strong independent companion, whose intelligent and capable on her own.  SHe does fall into a ""I'm in unrequited love with Ten"" thing that in retrospect did hurt her as a character a lot.  She developed later on Torchwood and in her appearances in later seasons.  I was kind of sad to see her go after only a single season.

Donna was a surprise for me.  I wasn't crazy about her at first, but she grew on me hard.  Her attitude and personality were just so different than Martha and Rose that she quickly carved out her own niche.  And her ""oy!"" nature actually often helped out in different situations.  The Doctor-Donna was a bit of a fanwank, but still, I thought the end of S4 was awesome all and all.

Wilfred was another interesting direction to take the companion role, though he's only the main companion in The End of Time.  An older male companion, who has both some world weary elements while still having a great sense of wonder about the universe.  I think it would have been great to have a few episodes of him and the Doctor wandering around together just the two of them.

Which brings us to the Ponds.  I adored Amy.  I have a massive thing for redheads, and her in a police uniform got me whistling.  And for the most part, Amy delivers.  She has that same forceful driving personality like Donna.  That being said, Amy is a pretty terrible person, especially when it comes to how she treats Rory for most of season 5 and 6.  And when you figure in all the time prior to the show (or, I suppose just in the gap between when 11 first met Amy and the rest of the first episode), I felt really bad for Rory.  And there was a bit of a love triangle thing with 11 and Rory, but fortunately, 11 seemed completely uninterested and they mostly established that Amy really does love Rory, but sometimes has to think he's going to die to actually show it properly.  Rory himself doesn't have much personality besides ""I love Amy Pond"" and I don't think would have made much of a character on his own.

Clara's first two episodes (Asylum and the Christmas special) were a strong start.  She has the whole ""Clever boy"" thing which I rather like.  In some ways, you get the feeling she might actually be as smart as the Doctor, at least in Asylum.  She hasn't shown as much of the clever flirting in her 'modern' incarnation, but has so far still been pleasant.  I'm waiting for more episodes to judge further.

Thanks everyone for your support, the petition reached 100 signatures and I have seen that Urban Outfitters took down the advert on their website for the internship in question! Small victory when you look at the big picture, but it does show that a little pressure can have an impact - and I'll keep my eye out to check it doesn't appear again in the near future. 
If you feel strongly that unpaid internships are unfair and the law should be more strictly enforced to combat them, please get involved with intern rights groups such as Intern Aware. As long as people care about changing things rather than accepting 'that's just the way it is' even when 'it' is wrong, there's hope of doing something positive - as you all know, and I'm sorry I even just wrote that. Barf. But still true.

I'll look into starting a petition that a few people suggested, aimed at the government rather than at an individual company and focused on the HMRC clamping down on unpaid internships that break the law.

I told them that these are not jobs I want or think are suitable for me and they then contacted the job centre and cancelled my next 2 payments (without informing me of anything, I have to find out from the job centre) for not applying to a Job they've matched me too. 

On top of this, my personnel worker who I see every week seems to absolutely despise me, on my induction day, after I told him about my university degree and my past jobs salary he seemed to be almost jealous or seemed to give me the impression that I was showing off a bit too much. 

Most of the people who go to the work program I've been placed on are illiterate and have no experience or qualifications, I feel I've just been placed on the wrong program and It's really not for me, so I spoke to the job centre about leaving it and they say I can't, after I've been placed on a work program I can't be taken off.

This is what I need help with, is there a loophole or anything I can do to basically get myself of this program without it affecting my benefit?

Sorry for any formatting mistakes, I'm pretty new to Reddit, thanks! 

Thanks for all the advice/harsh comments!

I can only hope that this is because he has only started 19 EPL games this season (missing the rest through injury and suspension). 

There is an incredible correlation between our performances when he plays and when he is omitted from the squad. For example, he played all but one game (which he missed through suspension) during our 10 match unbeaten streak. Adversely, he has only started 6 games in 2013 and our form has seemingly plummeted. 

So why is he overlooked?

Largely because he plays in a position where his off-the-ball positioning is equally as important as when he has the ball at his feet. It infuriates me when fans of any team dub these sorts of players as useless. Michael Carrick is the perfect example of this. He has undeniably been at the heart of Man Utd's success this season, but the fans find him 'boring' and he gets assailed with critique that asserts that 'anybody could play that role'. Take the time to focus on Carrick during a Utd game and it will soon become evident that he is a fundamental cog in the Utd machine.

Back to Tettey. He (along with Johnson, who I also deem as underrated) is our key player in the 'transition' phase of a passage of play and provides that gel between attack and defence, a role in which Hoolahan and Howson have been ineffectual in Tettey's absence. Combine this with his athleticism, stamina and technique and you are looking at a top class player. If he had not picked up this injury we would be laughing at the relegation battle from our perched position above that elusive 40 point barrier. 

I agree that Bassong has been fantastic, along with Snodgrass and Johnson. However, Tettey's efforts should not be snubbed because of the position he plays and the intangible contributions that he makes to the team.",false,NorwichCity,t5_2sv0y,null,null,self,The importance of Alexander Tettey,5,http://www.reddit.com/r/NorwichCity/comments/1c7cu1/the_importance_of_alexander_tettey/

One of the things I made damn sure I did do though was past papers. Literally as many as I could get my hands on, and then I marked them.

The problem with our exam system is that once you've done one paper, you've done them all. Seriously, going through the process of writing then marking one paper after the other meant that I knew exactly how to structure my answers and what points the examiners were looking for. I did really well in the end and I maintain it was all down to this.

I'd like to recommend CPG's revision and test books for all of you. If you haven't used them before, they are great, for a variety of reasons:

* Cheap. While most revision books nowadays are £20 or more, these are normally under £5. Great when you're about to start a new subject or year, so you don't have to break the bank.

* Clear, concise and useful. The books are very easy-to-use and understand.

* Humurous. They may not be the best, but they do add little jokes every so often. Great for when you're bored of revision, revision, revision!

* Great tests after each topic. These are what makes you remember stuff for the exams.

* And of course, they're light! Every other revision guide I've ever used is heavy, but these are super-light. Great for taking to school!

Thanks for reading,

Close your eyes.

Breath in counting to five through your nose.
Hold your breath counting to five.
Breath out through your mouth counting to five.

Rinse and repeat five times or more if you are still cacking yourself.

If you don't know an answer just move on to the next and comeback to it later.

Another tip, KIS (Keep It Simple),break the question down. Your teachers have probably taught a variant of the question so try to relate it to what you know.

You may have been told that it is a good idea to show your working so you can be given marks if you get it wrong, but the marking schemes are much worse than that. There is only ever 1 mark for the correct answer, all the other marks are given for method and working, NOT answers. 

If you look at the question on the paper, it should tell you the number of marks for that question or part-of-question. If it has 1 mark, it is for the correct answer. If it has more than 1 mark, only 1 is for the correct answer, and the rest are for the method and working.

This means that if there are 4 marks available, and you do it all in your head and put down the correct answer, you will only get 1 mark. You will *lose 3 marks* for not writing the method. On the other hand, if you have no idea how to get the answer, but scribble down some crap that seems vaguely familiar, you could easily get 1 or 2 marks for the question - more than the genius that did it all in their head.

It is possible to get every answer right and fail the paper if you never give any methods. You can get only a few answers right and still pass if you show your method.

I just want to say good luck to all of you in your exams! Make sure your revise hard, yadda yadda. 

But if you're struggling in any particular subject I'm willing to help you out. 

I'm currently doing my AS levels (maths, further maths, economics, history, physics &amp; critical thinking). These are my preferred subjects, but I am fairly adept at the majority of subjects. 

I got 10 A* s at GCSE - Maths, english lit, english lang, history, french, music, drama, physics, biology, chemistry and also a diploma in ICT (*not* computing, I can't code for shit, sorry). 

If you need any help, in any of those subjects, or even ones that I haven't done, I'm willing to try and find the time to assist you, provide you with links I used to revise and whatnot. If you also want me to glance over any coursework you've got, I'll be more than happy to. I got 100% in my coursework for the subjects that required it (drama, music, history, english lit, english lang &amp; french), I know how to get the marks and it is a particular formula, if you know it, you're sorted. 

I must say, I have to revise too, and I may be busy, but I'll always try and reply ASAP. I'll let you know if I can't help you (this will mainly be with art/design tech subjects). 

My biggest piece of advice though, is to relax. GCSEs may feel big, but when you look back next year, or in 5 years, or 10 years, you'll ask what all the hype was about. If you put the work in you'll be fine.

If you're interested, drop me a PM with your issues - any particularly areas of concern, when you're available and how you want to contact me (Kik, Skype, PMs on here..)

Leaving aside the fact half the population of the UK appear to be claiming they were active communists or something during the 80s, let's look at Thatcher's record in NI:

* Opposed hunger strikers, let a few of them die off before allowing them to wear tracksuits to breakfast or whatever (while the bold Gerry told a few more to die because it was good press).
* Signed ~~Downing St Declaration~~ Anglo Irish Agreement - giving another government an unprecedented say in a constituent part of the UK. A government whose treatment of it's own minority has been something of a grey area to say the least. Again a typically Thatcherite bold move but this one was definitely pro-nat.

What gives? Disregarding the fact history seems to support the idea that the sum total of nationalist aspirations in 1981 about giving Sands &amp; Co some decent clothes to wear, why the hatred for Thatcher? Arguably the ~~Downing St Declaration~~ Anglo-Irish Agreement paved the way for the negotiations that lead to GFA.

However, I've found a site which is essentially making a loss on selling mousepads. So, if you need one, get it now. It's all legit and uses paypal, have bought one myself.

Ships to UK, 67p (cheaper than the cheapest custom mousemats you'll see, I believe), uses paypal and people who bought them last time they had this deal say they are of a decent quality.

This code is unlimited, however you'll have to clear your cookies, change IP and make a new account each time you use it yourself.

I'm an Australian and my girlfriend is Scottish (family lives in Hawick). We are going over in August so I can meet her family in person, and for a bit of a holiday.

I'm considering proposing to her whilst over there, but I don't want to buy a ring here and take it over - aside from the fact that they are more expensive here in Australia, I feel it would be better to organise a ring with a local jeweller in Edinburgh and pick it up when we get there.

So... I'm after any and all recommendations for a good jeweller in Edinburgh. My budget probably stretches to 3000 pounds, but I'd prefer to keep it under 2500 if possible. I would prefer to buy from a local jeweller and not a chain jewellery store (if those exist in Scotland?) - something that is a bit of a memento of home as much as a ring.

Coleman: There's a certain part of the TARDIS you go to, that liftoff thing. But you know, the TARDIS and Clara have a relationship. Actually I don't think we've talked about this in interviews before. It's something that's running through the series. Instead of it being like, ""Does so-and-so like Clara?"" The TARDIS and Clara have a bit of a face-off. So, the Doctor is obviously bringing back somebody new.

I realized something yesterday:  The man that stood next to Clara as she cried over her mother's grave was not her father.  Didn't look anything like him.  His hair was shorter, styled differently, and was blonde (Clara's dad has dark brown hair).  The way he stood with Clara -- almost a foot away from her -- and the way she doesn't respond to his pat on the back, indicates that these two are not close in any emotional sense.  The way he stares at the grave before him though indicates that he did care about the person buried there.

So who is he?  And where was Clara's dad?  The dad is still alive, but I suspect that he may never have recovered from his wife's death.  He's become someone who doesn't mind leaving long, angry messages about the government with complete strangers.

While bad special effects don't bother me as much as they do some, these are just horrific. I get that it was the sixties, but they seem poor even for that time. Like, all the times they're VERY OBVIOUSLY using a small-scale model. In one shot, whatever they were focusing on even looked like a painting when it was supposed to be a city or something!

Also, did they really not have the budget to shoot scenes more than once? The amount of line-flubbing is absurd! I know Hartnell eventually decided that it would be a character choice, but it doesn't even seem like that. It seems like a mistake. Also, though he's obviously the worst offender, he's not the only one doing it. I've also noticed Barbara and a few side characters do it. I get that the BBC has a notoriously low budget, but this is crazy to me.

I even like Hartnell and all of the companions (a bit sad about Susan right now), but the bad outweighs the good for me. So how about it? Does it get better?

I currently live in Southern California, USA. I have a few things that I have questions or concerns about:

-The internship pays $1700 (£1100) per month and I don't know if I will be able to live easily off of this amount. From what I have read, Birmingham is an expensive place to live.

-I'm 22 years old so I would like to live in area with a younger community and a nice nightlife. Also I would like to easily be able to join some sort of sports team or gym.

-I plan on traveling by public transportation and by bicycle while I'm there. I assume this will not be an issue. Is biking in the rain a major inconvenience?

-Any recommendations for cellular phone companies for a year contract or prepaid system? I'm just going to use the phone I have now and transfer carriers.

-What is a good bank to use?

These are the major things I can think of. I will update with more if I think of them. Any added tips will be appreciated. Thanks.

The Fixed Point in Time is something that the Doctor has thrown at us since the beginning of the first season. By wiki definition:


""Fixed points in time were moments in the space-time continuum at which events were set in stone and could never, ever be changed, no matter what.""


But are they set in stone? The first time that a fixed point in time was witnessed being broken was Rose attempting to save her father. Not to mention she came in direct contact with herself, physically. The Reapers appeared, the strange alien creatures no one reallly heard of before but the Doctor. He said that Time Lords used to keep time in check, and therefore the Reapers as well. They banished the Reapers by correcting the events.The Reapers have not been seen since.


This is one of three instances where a fixed point in time was broken. The second being the alternate death of captain Adelaide Brooker.We never got a chance to see if the Reapers had appeared because she corrected the events so quickly. In ""Waters of Mars"", the Doctor saved her when she was meant to die in the Mars' base self destruct, her and two others.The Reapers were not instantaneous and Brooker had time to cause her own death, which was all that was needed for the event to occur.There is one slight problem with Brooker.


She tells the Doctor a story of how she was a child during the Dalek invasion. How, a Dalek came to her window and decided not to kill her. The Doctor theorized that the Dalek knew that she was a fixed point in time, and didn't kill her.


I'm sure that fixed points in time matter a lot when you are DESTROYING ALL OF REALITY.


The Dalek's reality bomb would have destroyed the past, present, and future. And if our fixed points were happening in an alternate reality well, those got pasted too. My question is why did the Dalek have any regard for a fixed point in time while they were destroying the whole of reality anyway? And they were killing thousands. This isn't even considering the hundreds of people killed in the Cyberman, Dalek war, or the Sontaran Stratagem. Let's not even get started on the stuff going on in Torchwood. But all these casualties, and you are going to tell me a fixed point wasn't broken?


""Adelaide, I've done this sort of thing before. In small ways, save some little people, but never anyone as important as you-oh, I'm good!"" -The Tenth
""'Little people!?' What, like Mia and Yuri? Who decides they're so unimportant!? YOU!?"" -Adelaide Brooker


""Nobody important? Blimey, that's amazing. Do you know in nine hundred years of time and space I've never met anyone who wasn't important before."" -The Eleventh


Who is to say that fixed points in time are not changed? In the most recent episode, ""The Rings of Ahkaten"", Clara's parents meet by pure chance. A leaf falling off a tree and hitting her dad in the face, so that he stumbles into the street. He could have been like Rose's dad, and probably getting hit by the same car too. But Clara's mother saved him, and he kept the leaf. The Old God choked on that leaf when he tried to devour it. Because ""infinity is too much"". If I fed off possibilities, I would probably sink into a food coma after two seconds of the Doctor. But the Doctor wasn't enough. He wasn't one of he ""little people"". The Leaf, is significant, because it is a small event, that could change the course of history. The Doctor still fails to see that it is the little things that build up to large events, and that taking one piece of Jenga out of a seemingly perfect tower, could knock it all down.


There is no such thing as a fixed point in time- too radical a statement? Whenever a point is broken we see different results. River choosing not to kill the Doctor caused a massive paradox because he was such a large point in time. Is this to say that Rose's Dad and Brooker were ""smaller"", and he was ""bigger""? So I have three theories.


1. There are fixed points in time that happen no matter what events, even the utter annihalation of the universe and alternate dimensions as we know them.


2. Time can be rewritten via changing fixed points in time, but this requires great effort and usually ends in paradox (Reapers, ""Wedding of River Song"").


3. There are no such things as fixed points in time. Simply challenges that the Doctor must face, as his very presence and his actions, and the villains and people around him, change history.


OR, one last theory.


4. The Doctor himself is a fixed point in time. The changing universe, literally, revolves around his actions. All paradoxes that have affected the world have been a result of him somehow. He brought Rose to her father, he brought Amy and Rory along, and is therefore responsible for the creation of River Song, and he saved Brooker. All of this is because of the Doctor. What if Time Lords are a paradox, who change time according to what they beleive to be ""The Order""?

However, they both have a game in hand.


We have 5 games left, with our toughest opponent being fixture being Man City.  Assuming we drop our game to Man City (pray that we don't), our max points will be 12 with a low range of 9 if we also lose to Wigan/Southampton/Stoke/Sunderland.  That gives us a grand total of 67-70 points.


Gooners have 6 games left, with their toughest opponent being United.  Assuming they drop their United fixture, their max points will be 15, with a low range of 9, if they drop their matches against Everton/Wigan.  That gives them a range of 66-72.


Chelsea also has 6 games, with their toughest opponent being United.  Their other tough fixtures will be Everton and Liverpool.  If they lose to United, they'll have a max of 15 points, and a lower range of 9 if they lose to Everton/Liverpool too.  That gives them a range of 67-75.


So assuming all 3 play their best and all 3 lose to Manchester clubs, Spurs will be out of the race.  Our fate lies with them doing poorly to have a chance at the top 4.  God help us if they are able to beat any of their tough fixtures.  


What do you all think?  If we beat Man City or Wigan, I think we'll have a pretty good shot.  If we drop points, we're probably out.  Those games early in the season are starting to haunt us, like the 80+ min concessions, that dreadful Everton Away game and our recent Fulham fixture.

So, I've recently seen the The Angels of Manhattan episode. Honestly though, I hated it. I'm not saying it was bad or anything. But that episode has been the ONLY things that has made me tear up when watching a movie. No movie has even brought out these emotions in me. Until this episode. It was too depressing. It's just that Amy and Rory have been part of the series for two and a half freaking series. Since the beginning of season 5 to midway of season 7. That's a really long time for being a companion. They have been a major part of the series. And in season 7 episodes, you notice how the Doctor really loved Amy and Rory (staying at their house, constant hugging and worrying, stuff like that). The fact that he lost them, in that episode (though they didn't die, but he couldn't see them anymore, so it's basically like they died) really made me distressed to the point where I wish I hadn't seen that episode. I guess they have just grown on me... 

The ending when Amy and Rory left the Doctor for good was just too heart breaking to bear. When the angel touched Rory, I literally gasped and felt fear and disbelief. Something I've never done before.

Now, I know the Doctor explained that he couldn't go back to that point in time once again because it would tear Manhattan apart. But what has been bugging me is that why can't the Doctor just go back a few years AFTER the angel planted them into the past? Or why can't he go back a few years before? He could easily wait a little bit and then see them once again. Then he can just pick them up in the TARDIS and continue the adventure once again! It seems so simple!

It's just that, you can see how the Doctor loved Amy and Rory... I kinda feel sad for him. It's like he lost a part of his life... I still wish I hadn't seen that episode. It was too heartbreaking to bear. I mean, I know it's just a movie. It's fiction. But damn... they just grew on me you know?

27' Sheffield Wednesday score :( **0-1**

**HT** Pretty lackluster first half as we have come to expect over the last few months. Refereeing has been poor apparently. Also, this is now 18 league matches without a first half goal.. Hopefully McDermott understands the word 'substitute' and makes a few during half time!

45' Diouf on for Norris, Lee on for Coke

60' Morison off for Aidy White

63' **GGGGGGGGOOOOOOOOOOAAAAAAAAAAAALLLLLLLLLLLLL LUKE VARNEEEEEEEEEYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY** 1-1

**[AND ANOTHER](https://twitter.com/andrewvarley/status/323077327770750977/photo/1)**

**POST MATCH SUMMARY:** Not a good first half, didn't catch much of it on the radio but saw reports that we played better than SW but still poorly and were unlucky to concede. Great work from McDermott, half time change to add on Diouf and put Varney in a central position which obviously worked wonders. Last 15 minutes were pretty uncomfortable but defence held well, Kenny made a few good saves and Austin made some good clearances too. Hopefully Warnock is not badly injured.. Otherwise we could potentially have 3 out for the next game.. Either way this should confirm our safety in the championship and is a great result for McDermott, definitely would've lost that with Warnock IMO because he wouldn't have made the changes that led to the win.

I think, generally, HIGNFY is becoming a lot more about the script writers for the auto-cue. About 70% of the show is taken up with the scripted lines and clips from funny news related television snipbits - funny in themselves, but not a panel quiz show...it'd be great to have it's own show of this type, but HIGNFY should be about the panellists, not just the ones who write the lines for the auto cue.

Also, I know this is a bit 'sacrilegious' but last night was just half an hour of Brian Blessed - no one else really got a word in edgeways.

**- - - - - - - - - KICK-OFF - - - - - - - - -**

**4mins**: Nice start to the game, the fans are shouting ""Hooof"" whenever West Ham play a long ball. Maybe we should get a few goals before we get smug!

**17mins**: Saints are playing some good football, no clear cut chances yet though. West Ham are very compact when Saints have the ball, leaving Saints to try and find a way through.

**33mins**: Saints are cranking up the pressure. We are seeing some patient build-up play, Lallana having a shot on the turn blocked.

**36mins**: From a dangerously delivered freekick, Lambert off the line at the far post! Great save but it might have been behind the line...

**40mins** Lallana and Nolan get up in each other's faces. This game has seen a lot of niggley tackles and off the ball incidents. Everyone needs to calm down before someone sees red. 

**45mins**: Lambert heads over from range, so close!

**- - - - - - - - - HALF-TIME - - - - - - - - -**

Well, it's a physical and edgy affair. West Ham are at St Marys to defend and make life as difficult as possible for Southampton. They achieved that in the first half, they certainly wound up the Saints players and we've seen tackles flying in. Saints have played the more attractive football but only created one serious chance which arrived at the end of the half. It's all to play for, as long as everyone can control their tempers...

**- - - - - - - - - SECOND HALF - - - - - - - - -**

**54mins**: Carroll hits the ball just past the post from just outside the six yard box. Yoshida mistimed a header which lead to the opening.

**57mins**: West Ham Sub -Jarivs off for Collison

**58mins**: **GOAL!** **Gaston Ramirez** with quick feet gets past two sliding West Ham defenders. Really tidy finish past the keeper!

**61mins**: Goal mouth scramble but Saints get it away, phew.

**64mins**: West Ham Sub -Tomkins off for Pogatetz

**66mins**: **GOAL!** **Andy Carroll** scores a low freekick from outside the box. Bugger.

**71mins** Saints Sub - Lallana off for J-Rod

**77mins**: Ramirez may have scored but he hasn't half been wasteful at times. He's subbed for Puncheon.

**82mins**: Lambert's turn to have a freekick.. nope, off the wall for a corner.

**84mins**: West Ham Sub - Vaz Te off for Taylor (booo)

**92mins**: J-Rod's long range shot is saved!

**Suarez Nutmegs**


***

**Updates**

10 minutes on and no major action.  Liverpool doing well to maintain good spacing, but have failed to hold together any extended runs of possession.  Reading not pushing the game (so far) as many people expected.

**14'** Suarez collects a flick on near the top of the box.  With only the keeper to beat, Suarez chips the ball over McCarthy only to have the ball headed off the line by Gunter.
 
**17'** A nice bit of passing for Liverpool leads to a Suarez cross for Coutinho.  McCarthy punches the ball away to safety.

**22'** Suarez, on the counter, plays Sturridge onto goal.  Sturridge can't quite get a shot off in time and the ball ends back up with Coutinho.  McCarthy parries Coutinho's shot for Liverpool's fourth corner--which Carragher heads just wide.  A flurry of chances, but no goals.

**29'** Reading on the counter and Gerrard takes a clumsy challenge.  Clattenburg plays on, but Gerrard won't be able to get away with too many more of those.

**34'** Gunter turns the ball over to Sturridge who sends the ball up to Suarez at the top of the box.  Suarez shot is blocked and Gerrard's follow-up is sent out for a corner.  More good chances, but no goals yet.

**38'** Lucas and Johnson having trouble clearing the ball.  A cross comes in for an open McCleary in the box, but a full stretch lunge from Carragher saves the day.

**39'** Sturridge is driving on the counter and a deflected ball comes back to an open Coutinho in the box.  A surprised Coutinho slices the ball well wide.

**42'** **Yellow--Lucas** Reading keep their cool on the counter and McCleary ends on 1-on-1 with Lucas.  McCleary plays the ball past the Brazilian and Lucas fouls to end the play. 

**44'** Sturridge holds up play in the box, chips the ball to Henderson who takes a nice volley and earns a corner.

**45'** Agger heads the corner to Sturridge who is blocked by McCarthy at point blank range.

**45'** Agger heads the final corner just wide as Carragher just can't quite get there.

**HALFTIME** Liverpool have now gone 165 min without finding the back of the net

**49'** A nice bit of passing ensues as Liverpool counter.  Gerrard holds up on the edge of the box and drives a low cross in front of goal.  Suarez flicks the ball into the back of the net, but the flag is up for offsides.

**51'** **Yellow-Guthrie**  Sturridge collects the ball to stop a Reading attack and runs up field.  Sturridge flicks past Guthrie near midfield and Guthrie wraps Daniel up knowing he was the last man.  Delay as Clattenburg realizes he has lost his yellow card.

**55'** Liverpool have numbers and time inside the Reading penalty area, but poor passing dooms the chance to score.

**58'** **Substitution** (Reading) Carrico on for Karacan

**58'** **Substitution** (Liverpool) Downing on for Henderson.  After a few minutes of play, it looks like Downing has taken up position on the right wing and Suarez has moved into a more central roll.  This should mean more touches for Suarez.

**64'** Liverpool trying to play with more of a sense of urgency and move the ball up the pitch quickly.  This is resulting in a lot of sloppy play and turnovers.

**65'** Sturridge lays another ball of for Coutinho who sidefoots the ball just wide.  (Dejavu)

**66'** Reading on the counter slide a cross into the box.  The shot on net is excellently blocked by Reina as Liverpool are lucky not to concede.

**68'** Reina comes to collect a corner and misses the ball.  Shots, blocks, and penalty shouts follow as Liverpool are extremely fortunate not to give up the score.

**68'** Liverpool on the counter have an odd man 4 on 3, but their passing fails them.

**72'** Sturridge has time and the ball on the right wing.  He plays a lovely pass on the ground to Coutinho at the top of the box.  Coutinho blasts the ball wide as usual.

**76'** Gunter is looking to slow the ball down for a cross and Coutinho lunges late from behind.  Lucky to escape without a yellow.

**77'** The ball bounces into the Liverpool box and Reading have an excellent attempt from the middle of the penalty area.  Reina tips the ball over for a corner.

**78'** Suarez has a free kick from ~35 yards out.  The ball curves and dips, beats McCarthy, but is just wide.

**81'** The ball turns over and Gerrard finds Suarez streaking, but the play is brought back for offsides.

**82'** Suarez splits defenders at the top of the box and is able to drill the ball on net, but it is right at McCarthy.

**83'** Delay in the game as Morrison is treated for injury.

**84'** Sturridge reaches a through ball that looked to be going out.  He finds an open Downing who makes a move and rifles the ball just wide of the near post.

**85'** Downing and Johnson display nice overlapping play.  The ball is crossed to Gerrard at the top of the penalty area who demonstrates to Coutinho how to put the ball on net.  Great save by McCarthy.

**86'**  Suarez shoots from mere yards away with lots of goal to aim at.  McCarthy plays superman and comes up with the diving save.

**86'** Downing gets a chance at the top of the box, but the shot goes straight to McCarthy.

**87'** With time running out, Reading look to be okay with playing slow.

**90'** Sturridge takes a bouncing ball and boots it toward goal, but it sails over.

4 minutes of extra time coming.

**92'** Suarez loses his defender with a feint and fires a dipping ball into the far end of the goal.  Superman McCarthy is there for the save.

**94'** Gerrard boots the long shot on goal, but a diving block from McCarthy keeps it out.

Regardless of CL qualification, it's going to be exciting. Players like Holtby and Sig will actually get a full pre season with AVB and it's possible we'll see the change into 433 (We all know AVB wants this). We'll also FINALLY see our strongest side with Sandro/KaBOOOOM back in the selection line ups. 

I'm not sure what I should think transfer wise, our needs are obvious but whether Levy spends or not could depend on CL. At the very minimum I'd like to see a LB and a striker come in. Danny Rose has done well at Sunderland but that doesn't mean he'd do well at the Lane, striker wise I'd be looking into Benteke/Remy, Benteke would be easier for wages and is a very Levy type of deal. I also don't think we'll be selling anyone that will grab headlines; BAE, Gallas (Free) with the possibility of Parker, Thudd, Defoe/Ade.

He is 16, he lives in Dorset (near gillingham-i thought i had his address, but it actually belonged to a friend of his). I know his bank, i know his IP address, email, facebook and that he likes to make legal highs. 

I seriously doubt the police will be able to return my money even if they do prosecute him, is there anything i can do at all? 
He owes me £250, and has taken at least £2000 from others, likely more.

The story (by Mark Gatiss) was great without any noticeable plot holes. The interaction between every single character was great and realistic, there was no forced dialogue. Ice Warriors were terrifying and unexpected; Grand Marshall Scaldac was very well-written.

 The end of the episode was unusually satisfying, I usually feel like the episodes are rushed, but tonight I'm really glad I took the time to watch it.

When Doctor Who began again in 2005 it brought with it a new cast (obviously) but in a new way. Rose came from a working class background and The 9th Doctor was a gruff ""Northerner"". This was a great new spin on DW portraying the 'real' Britain... Not the quaint Britishness many Foreigners associate with us.

As the show progressed it undoubtedly got better and (forgive me if I'm wrong) gained a much larger fan base in the US. This is great! The 10th Doctor (undoubtedly my favourite, irrelevant I know) brought so many new aspects to the show and Russell T. Davies really outdid himself with the writing.

It was sad when he left but its always great to have a breath of fresh air and Matt Smith did that excellently! Steven Moffat is undoubtedly a good *one off* writer... Silence in the Library and The Empty Child were excellent one offs! But he doesn't seem to be able to hold a series together... The quality of writing has, rather sadly, deteriorated and I'm not blaming this on the new American audience merely attributing it to them as a result of Moffat trying to give them the Doctor Who they enjoy...

But that was 11, you say... the 11th Doctor's ganger was killed, you say...

At the end of that episode, when the Doctor-ganger and the scientist are blocking the exit from the monster and the factory is about to explode the Doctor says 'Your molecular memory can survive this, you know? This may not be the end.' Then he passes the ganger his sonic screwdriver.

What if 10 in the upcoming episode is the ganger that was killed when the acid factory exploded. His molecular memory was retained by the living flesh (which somehow survived) and reincarnated him. But instead of reincarnating into 11, it has a random chance of reincarnating into any of the Doctor's regenerations and randomly lands on 10.

Yet while we've been talking about ""Classic"" doctors appearing in the 50th, I don't really think the 1st and 2nd have had much consideration because obviously the original actors are dead but we know that David Bradley and Reece Shearsmith are portraying them both in this documentry.

All I'm thinking is that it would be such a waste to have them appear in this but not appear in the 50th, I mean obviously it isn't the same as having the original actors but it would be a fantastic substitute and probably introduce the very early Doctors to the show's newer fans and allow those who are older to somewhat see Doctors that they grew up with.",false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,null,null,self,"""An Adventure in Time and Space"" or so much more...",3,http://www.reddit.com/r/doctorwho/comments/1cattp/an_adventure_in_time_and_space_or_so_much_more/

Assuming that a burlesque is something you can enjoy, I can wholeheartedly recommend it to anyone. The play was structured with an intense affection for the source material, is densely packed with in-jokes and respect of canon details, and was utterly hysterical throughout its entire hour-long length.

It featured the Sixth, Ninth, Tenth, and Eleventh Doctors; Amy, Donna, Rose, and Sarah Jane; and the Master, Ood, Cybermen, Menoptera, Daleks, and Weeping Angels.

It starts with Eleven realizing she's now a woman, and her and Amy meeting up with her former incarnations. The Doctors do impressive jobs of channeling their roles; Ten in particular does a stellar job of channelling Tennant.

For added comedy, the show is done within the framework of a PBS pledge drive. :)

While the women are of course not hard on the eyes, the show's primary assets (pardon the pun) lie in the deeply solid comedy and in its love of its subject matter.

Anyway, I highly recommend it! (I am in no way associated with the show. Just laughed myself silly, that's all.)

Lyrics: 


Once upon a time a few mistakes ago

I was in your sights, you got me alone

You found me, you found me, you found me

I guess you didn't care, and I guess I liked that

And when I fell hard you took a step back

Without me, without me, without me

And he's long gone when he's next to me

And I realize the blame is on me

'Cause I knew you were trouble when you walked in

So shame on me now

Flew me to places I'd never been

'Til you put me down, oh

I knew you were trouble when you walked in

So shame on me now

Flew me to places I'd never been

Now I'm lying on the cold hard ground

Oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble

Oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble

No apologies, he'll never see you cry

Pretend he doesn't know that he's the reason why

You're drowning, you're drowning, you're drowning

Now I heard you moved on from whispers on the street

A new notch in your belt is all I'll ever be

And now I see, now I see, now I see

He was long gone when he met me

And I realize the joke is on me, yeah!

I knew you were trouble when you walked in

So shame on me now

Flew me to places I'd never been

'Til you put me down, oh

I knew you were trouble when you walked in

So shame on me now

Flew me to places I'd never been

Now I'm lying on the cold hard ground

Oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble

Oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble

And the saddest fear comes creeping in

That you never loved me or her, or anyone, or anything, yeah

I knew you were trouble when you walked in

So shame on me now

Flew me to places I'd never been

'Til you put me down, oh

I knew you were trouble when you walked in (you were right there, you were right there)

So shame on me now

Flew me to places I'd never been

Now I'm lying on the cold hard ground

Oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble

Oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble


I knew you were trouble when you walked in

Trouble, trouble, trouble

I knew you were trouble when you walked in

Trouble, trouble, trouble


Breakdown::

The first verse would be when she met him and fell for him almost instantly, he withdrew from her. Made sure she knew that he couldn't be in love. 

""He's long gone when he's next to me"" would be referring to him being far gone after he lost Rose, he didn't want to get close to anyone like he did her. 

The next verse would be how he took her away, literally flew her away and they ended with her still loving him and knowing she would never be with him like she wanted. 

Next would be referring to the doctor not actually acknowledging how much  he means to his companions. And Martha just being another companion in her eyes.

The verse after the chorus that says that he never loved her or anyone would be about Martha's resentment about him not loving her, but taking her so soon after Rose would mean that maybe he doesn't love anyone and no one meant anything.

Exeter went 0-1 up with Reid scoring the goal, but it was only shortly after halftime that L Moore equalised for the hopeful Dons. It didn't last long, as Exeter regained their lead after three minutes to make the scoreline 1-2. The Dons fought on and within two minutes of Exeter's goal, they equalised as L Moore, again, scored for the Dons. After 15 shots from Wimbledon and 9 minutes added time, sadly the Dons couldn't secure three points and get the win they dearly needed.

**Burton Albion 1-0 Plymouth:** Yet another scrap between a promotion hopeful and a team fighting relegation out of the football league. Argyle pushed on till the very end, securing a point of a top 3 side. Sadly, Burton substitute scored in the final minute of extra time, securing a vital three points for Burton Albion, helping them get the instant promotion they are desperately searching for!

**Cheltenham 1-0 Gillingham:** Cheltenham, another side fighting for instant promotion, gained a massive 3 points today after narrowly beating already-promoted, top of the league Gillingham. Who knows, Gillingham may not have been playing their heart out, as they have already been guaranteed promotion, but they still have a Champions of League Two spot to play for. Cheltenham took the lead as Hector headed in Billy Jones corner.

**Chesterfield 2-2 Bradford:** As Chesterfield hosted to the Bantams, it wasn't long until wonder kid Nahki Wells scored in the 36th minute. Cheltenham came back and equalised in the 70th minute with Darwikwa, but Bradford were not satisfied with just one point, and within 10 minutes later, Ravenhill had scored to surely secure a vital 3 points to play-off hopefuls Bradford. It was at the last minute, where Chesterfield won themselves a point as Togwell dribbled the ball past the net. Fair play to Bradford, who dominated the game.

**Dagenham &amp; Redbridge 0-1 Oxford:** Oxford got a fairly important away win after Potter scored in the 40th minute to secure his team 3 points. 

**Northampton 0-2 York:** A massive shock as second-to-bottom of the table York City secured a massive, vital 3 points from play-off hopefuls Northampton. It was one of the first times Northampton have lost at their home stadium, Sixfields, this season. Not to mention York had majority possesion (45/55).

**Rochdale 2-2 Port Vale:** As Port Vale desperately looked for a win to join Gillingham in getting a guarenteed promotion to League One, they couldn't quite get all 3 points from middle of the table Rochdale. Rochdale took the lead 31 minutes in after an embarrassing own goal from Liam Chilvers. Their lead didn't last long, however, as Port Vale scored 3 minutes after conceding their own goal, Thomas Pope, League Two's top scorer with 31 goals, scored the goal. No goals occured until late in the game, where Chilvers made amends for his own goal earlier, by scoring for Port Vale and surely securing them 3 points. Nope. Rochdale fought back, and got a goal in injury time to make it 2-2. Kennedy with the goal. 

**Rotherham 2-1 Fleetwood:** Last years Conference Premier champions Fleetwood Town faces yet another defeat, making the chances of a second successive promotion looking very dim. They conceded an early goal in the 3rd minute, as Daniel Nardiello scored after the Fleetwood goalie's clearance fell to the feet of the Rotherham striker, allowing him to tuck it away. Fleetwood strived on, however, and after 3 minutes of Rotherham's goal, they got an equaliser, as David Ball netted the ball. It wasn't until the second half where Rotherham took the lead in the 62nd minute when Kieran Agard fired home after Ben Pringle's shot was blocked. Fleetwood probably deserved something from this game, but sadly travelled home with no points.

**Southend 0-0 Bristol Rovers:** No goals in this game as both teams held on and secured a point. Southend created several chanced put couldn't get the ball to the back of the net. This was the fifth game for their new manager, Phil Brown, and since he has came in to Southend, they have not yet won. The season keeps getting worse for Southend after minimal wins and, of course, a loss to Crewe in the J. Paint Trophy final. 

**Wycombe 2-1 Aldershot:** Wycombe, a team who seem to be safe from relegation yet miles away from play-offs, today hosted to bottom of the league Aldershot, as they fought to stay in the Football League. After an even first half, Wycombe fired home as McClure capitalised on a defensive blunder in the 50th minute. Aldershot, who were now desperate for at least 1 point, got their equaliser as Stanley scored in the 68th minute though. It didn't last long though, as 7 minutes later, Wycombe regained the lead after Joel Grant scored against his former side to secure Wycombe 3 points. The season is looking dim for Aldershot, too, as the end of the season nears and relegation glooms upon them. Their last three games are Southend (H), Dag &amp; Red (H) and Rotherham (A). To stay up in League Two, they will most probably need at least two wins. Rotherham away will be their toughest fixture, so they *must* get a win against Southend and Dagenham. 

**Accrington 2-0 Morecambe:** Accrington are doing extremely well at the moment, but after two frustrating draws, they finally got their win against Morecambe. They got a goal in the middle of the first half as Murphy scored after 28 minutes. They got a second one in the 58th minute after Amond doubled Stanley's lead. *BOTH TEAMS: Both teams recieved zero yellow cards today, so they win todays League Two fair-play award.*

So I have a scene from a short story of mine that I would like to have an audio recording of. It is a very passionate scene with some yelling and the confessing of love and all that other good stuff. I will be adding rain into the background to really knock it out of the ballpark. This is a great opportunity for those who like to read lines and it is especially testing since the scene is quite emotional.

I will be the female acting across from you. I'm 22 years old and have a relatively high voice. I ask that your voice isn't extremely low or sound too mature as we will be portraying two 19 year olds. 

There is an issue however. I live in Canada, so I'm not even sure how we would go about recording this...skype? But with this said, I am even interested in short audio clips that can be recorded individually.

If you are interested, please feel free to contact me here or email me: canadianchick91@outlook.com

I'm currently renting and looking to buy my first property in south London.

I'm wondering if there's anyone else like me who is lucky enough to put some money away every month after paying crazy rent prices out here. I'm just going to put down a few thoughts about the schemes available, and a general strategy that I think will work well while reducing exposure to risk later down the line - property value depreciation, rate rises, and the like.

**[NewBuy](http://www.newbuy.org.uk/newbuy-the-facts/)**

This is a fairly nice scheme where you only put in a 5% deposit - which means the lender puts in 95% of the value to buy the place. I've found rates are typically higher than standard mortgages as there's more money on the table, which further exposes the lender to risk.

I think it's hard to say whether rises in the BoE base rate will impact these mortgages so much, but the idea of my already fairly high repayments going even higher thanks to a rate rise doesn't feel so good - in the long run I'd end up paying so much interest it would be much harder to remortgage in a few years to a 70% LTV mortgage.

Another problem is that since the LTV is so high, your overall purchase price will have to be a bit low.

I think this scheme works well outside London in cities like Bristol and Manchester, where you can easily get a 2 bedroom starter flat for around 180-190k (assuming a ~10k deposit).

**[Help to Buy](http://www.helptobuy.org.uk/faq.aspx)**

This is the new, frankly batshit-crazy government scheme announced by George Osbourne in the April 2013 budget.

The idea is similar to NewBuy, except the government chips in up to 20% of the property's value in deposit, meaning you can take out a 75% LTV mortgage with a bigger deposit, meaning you benefit from lower mortgage rates and generally you have increased purchasing power. The government also guarantees the mortgage itself - which is pretty much a green light to completely irresponsible borrowing/lending. But hey, you'd be stupid not to take advantage of this scheme even if you blew the rest of your monthly money on crack and had a stash of money in your bed instead of somewhere sensible, like an ISA. :-) I digress...

The 20% loan from the government is interest free for 5 years, which means you can save the repayment value in an ISA/long term savings account and benefit from interest for 5 years whilst the loan itself is partly inflated away. In year 6, a 1.75% charge is made; I believe it increases each year by inflation + 1% thereafter.

Now, you might wonder whether this would be an irresponsible thing for you to do - bigger purchase price means more money owed, right? Well, I think it makes more sense as long as you don't overstretch your budget, and instead look at property of comparable value to one you'd purchase on NewBuy - your 25 year mortgage rates would be lower, a 2 bedroom flat in a good part of London will cost you £1,200/mo anyway - about the same as a mortgage for £250k.

There are some key caveats though. Right now, the scheme only extends to new build properties, and you must exchange contracts within 3 months of the start of negotiations. It's quite hard to find actually built properties that are available, as a lot of them get snapped up whilst still being built. Schemes like this also generally tend to increase the price of property, pushing it just out of reach for others.

Help to Buy will be extended to all properties in the future.

**Negotiation**

Many people say that new builds are overpriced and that you'll struggle to get the money back if and when you decide to move on. In any case, the builds are the suggested price and I've been led to believe that they're very much open to negotiation - so don't go in expecting to pay the list price!

It depends on how much is sold and the time of year as to how much negotiation power you have. If there are just a handful of plots left then you can put some ridiculously low offers in, and even if they're unsuccessful you can expect a counter offer.

Also towards the end of the financial year, builders are looking to push as much turnover through their books as they can. As we've just missed that window it's one to remember for 2014.

Don't get hard sold to, and take your time to read up on a plot's builder and try to get reviews before you go in.

It's also sensible to get an agreement in principle from a few banks/building societies based on your current circumstances before you go and look at properties so you know your estimated maximum.

Sometimes homebuilders will push refer you to 'independent' mortgage advisers to pre-qualify. They're a bit less independent than you'd imagine and they will communicate your maximum to the builder.

**Depreciation**

In some areas councils force builders to assign some housing to social/affordable housing schemes - one to watch for.

Of course your house's value may depreciate over time, and I think this is going to be more of a problem for new builds where the quality is regarded to be lower than those build pre-1990. In London I don't think this'll be much of a problem for the foreseeable future.

**Roundup**

After looking around myself I've decided it's a good time to buy, but I'm in no major hurry. All the while I'm just building my savings for the deposit, stamp duty, and so on. When a good plot I can't turn down comes up, then I'll give it a go.

I personally prefer the sound of Help to buy over NewBuy mostly down to the LTV being lower, and thus cheaper interest rates. It also gives me some extra room to get something really nice.

**Questions**

* Are you a recent first time buyer? If so, what was your experience and did you use any government backed schemes?
* Do you have any tips or useful stories for first time buyers?

So I wanted to ask a couple of questions about the what not's(is that a proper term? :))

Traveling:
I'm based in Swansea, is there a site with routes of buses I can take?
I'm Polish and we have a site jakdojade.pl. I would love to see something like this for major UK cities.

Healthcare:
I have a European Health Insurance Card.
Whenever I have some sickness, where do I go? Are there public clinics, where I can go? Is there something like ""generic"" doctor which will give me a direction to which doctor should I go now?

Maybe this and many other things are covered somewhere. Would use link :)

It was always going to be hard to get that second goal when City finished the game with 5 defenders and 4 defensive midfielders but I think the main concern today was the atrocious defending (or lack of) in the first half. Time and time again they were getting far too much space and when Toure has that possibility the outcome usually won't be good.

I'd like to experiment more with both Torres and Ba playing together because when Torres came on, just his presence started to cause problems for the City team. The fact that there was another striker to deal with just slowed their stride into something more manageable for us and gave us the confidence to actually make use of the possession which we previously got none of.

Ultimately disappointed by the first half performance and some of the ridiculous officiating (Aguero, what a wanker) but we lost today purely through giving City too much space. At least that makes the last days of the season a little easier in terms of the schedule... but it doesn't really help to ease the pain of losing our first FA Cup match in normal time in 29 games.

Everyone and their mother knows that you cannot defend with 6. Its not possible, no matter what side you are up against. I've seen over and over again people raving about oscar's willingness to work and to track back, I don't see it. Individually, Oscar, Mata, and Hazard are fantastic, quality players. Let me stress that again, ON the ball.

Away from the ball, I see minimal effort out of Mata (offensively speaking) and zero from Hazard and Oscar. The lack of runs away from the ball prevent us from stretching the back line in any way, either vertically or horizontally, opening up room for our holding midfielders, much less Ba or Torres. 

Defensively, I see a complete unwillingness to defend from this trio and if they are tracking back, they are just passengers, doing so at a snail's pace. The balance that Benitez said we have is not better, it doesn't exist. 

As if the effort wasn't lacking enough, we have no size. We have to play the ball out of the back where Ivanovich, Terry, Cahill, and Bertrand all struggle with, partially because in times like this when our midfield actually SHOULD be coming to the ball, they don't. If we don't play it out of the back and kick it long, how often do any of these three go airborne for the ball and provide at least a decent challenge?

Lastly, 50-50 ball-winners, these three are incapable of winning such challenges or even attempting so. They are so dainty that they will never put a strong foot in, or go to ground.

You know who does give us a bit of guile, strength, effort (on and off the ball - as well as on both sides of the ball? Moses. As well as giving us another aerial threat from corners, goal kicks, and set pieces. His willingness to run away from the ball and drag defenders away. 

Lastly, I want to bitch about the Torres no-call because it is totally demeaning to the sport. Because he DIDN'T go to ground, there was no call. If anyone saw the penalty given to Girou yesterday it was the same scenario, shirt pulling, not by an overwhelming amount, but he went to ground. Referees need to be educated that going to ground doesn't allow for the penalty to be given and on the flip side, NOT going to ground doesn't mean there wasn't a foul. 

Summary: we need mettle, effort, and size in our midfield, people that can operate away from the ball. AND the players we do have, (mata, hazard, and oscar) need to put forth more effort. Do not mistake this post as a slashing of the trio, I love their ability, but in big games (except the three cup ties against UTD) we do not show up.",false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,null,null,self,Refusal to Change or Adapt,0,http://www.reddit.com/r/chelseafc/comments/1cc1dp/refusal_to_change_or_adapt/

A friend of mine in another country has invited me to visit them for a week or two.  They will be buying the plane ticket, and I will be staying with them.  All I need to cover is a bit of spending money, which I am able to do.

The problem is, I am on jobseekers allowance at the moment.  The rules *used to be* that you stopped your claim the day before you went, and made a rapid reclaim when you came back.  My question is, is that still the case, as far as anybody knows?  Obviously I will check with my adviser before leaving.

It's like Wheatly in Portal 2, doing the same test over and over again just doesn't have that much of a buzz to it. 

I've been rewatching Season 1 of NuWho, and it's things like this that you just don't get in the current season (specific lines bolded for awesomeness): 

&gt; (Rose and Mickey hug. The Doctor is up a ladder mending something.)
&gt; 
&gt; JACK: Aw, sweet, look at these two. How come I never get any of that? 
&gt; 
&gt; DOCTOR: Buy me a drink first. 
&gt; 
&gt; JACK: You're such hard work. 
&gt;
&gt; **DOCTOR: But worth it.**

&gt; 
&gt; MICKEY: There you go. 
(Mickey hands over Rose's passport.) 
&gt; 
&gt; ROSE: I can go anywhere now. 
&gt; 
&gt; DOCTOR: I told you, you don't need a passport. 
&gt; 
&gt; ROSE: It's all very well going to Platform One and Justicia and the Glass Pyramid of San Kaloon, but what if we end up in Brazil? I might need it. You see, I'm prepared for anything. 
&gt;
&gt; MICKEY: Sounds like your staying, then. So, what're you doing in Cardiff? And who the hell's Jumping Jack Flash? **I mean, I don't mind you hanging out with big-ears up there** 
&gt;
&gt; **DOCTOR: Oi!**
&gt;
&gt; **MICKEY: Look in the mirror.** But this guy, I don't know, he's kind of 
&gt;
&gt; JACK: Handsome? 
&gt;
&gt; **MICKEY: More like cheesy.** 
&gt;
&gt; JACK: Early twenty first Century slang. Is cheesy good or bad? 
&gt;
&gt; MICKEY: It's bad. 
&gt;
&gt; JACK: But bad means good, isn't that right? 
&gt;
&gt; DOCTOR: Are you saying I'm not handsome? 
&gt;
&gt; ROSE: We just stopped off. We need to refuel. The thing is, Cardiff's got this rift running through the middle of the city. It's invisible, but it's like an earthquake fault between different dimensions. 
&gt;
&gt; DOCTOR: The rift was healed back in 1869. 
&gt;
&gt; ROSE: Thanks to a girl named Gwyneth, because these creatures called the Gelth, they were using the rift as a gateway but she saved the world and closed it. 
&gt;
&gt; JACK: But closing a rift always leaves a scar, and that scar generates energy, harmless to the human race 
&gt;
&gt; DOCTOR: But perfect for the Tardis, so just park it here for a couple of days right on top of the scar and 
&gt;
&gt; JACK: Open up the engines, soak up the radiation. 
&gt;
&gt; ROSE: Like filling her up with petrol and off we go! 
&gt;
&gt; JACK: Into time! 
&gt;
&gt; DOCTOR + ROSE + JACK: And space!
&gt;
&gt; **MICKEY: My God, have you seen yourselves? You all think you're so clever, don't you?**

So everyone is cheering, Rose and the ""Doctor"" start a life together :'), but when Donna has to get her memory wiped or die the Doctor tells her that there never could be a Human/Timelord hybrid. So...what happens to the Doctor thats with Rose? Both Donna and the new Doctor have a human body, yet a Timelord brian, so I don't see why the after-effects should be different. Anyone have more info? Maybe I missed something?

3) The first 4 series had many back to back intense episodes with great writing and great plots .... Matt Smith seems to be getting the shit end of the stick IMHO

That, and I feel like we are not getting Clara character dev like we did with all other companions during adventured. You learned something of them after each episode.. Clara.. enigma... let's see how this plays out.

My mother works for a cattery in Essex, UK. If you don't know what a cattery is, it is pretty much a boarding kennels but for cats rather than dogs. Although it is horrible, some people seem to confuse the idea of a cattery with a cat shelter, or animal sanctuary, because sadly quite a few cats have been dumped outside in the last few years. Since I come from a cat family and a long line of cat lovers, we're usually able to find homes for these critters amongst ourselves. Sadly that isn't always possible (especially when you already have four cats at home, all of whom were strays/abandoned).

One night in August 2012 two cats were abandoned outside, in the pouring rain and in a sealed cardboard box. Since we didn't know anything about the kittys we decided to call them Lisa and Maggie. Presumably they were sisters, both jet black and very friendly (but understandably nervous). One of them - Lisa - has the notable distinction of having just one eye. The other, Maggie, was adopted maybe only a month after being dumped there.

Sadly, coming up to a year later, we are yet to find a home for Lisa and it seems no one is interested in adopting her. That means the poor kitty has spent more than eight months alone in a tiny kennel a bit smaller than your average garden shed, with very little in the way of company, engagement or entertainment. If she is real lucky maybe someone will sit with her and lavish her with attention for five minutes every day. That is all. She gets fed twice a day, she is in absolutely no danger of being euthanised, the worst case scenario for her is spending the remainder of her life in that tiny room alone (vet estimates her to be only two or three years old).

Now I really cannot stress enough how friendly and lovely the little lady is, and the extent to which she deserves a better life than the one currently on the cards for her. This kitty is honestly one of the most affectionate I've ever come across (and I've known 20+ cats by name) and it is a tragic waste because she is ready and willing to be best friends with anyone who'll have her and give her a good home. She has already been waiting nearly nine months and who knows how many more she might have to wait? That is where I thought Reddit might come in.

If you are... or anyone you know in England is... thinking about adopting a cat, please send me a private message and I can give you further details including a photograph (if you really need it, though I'm not sure you do) and a telephone number. If you or anyone you know is thinking of buying a cat please make sure you/they DON'T because there are millions of adult cats out there desperately in need of homes and they can't find them because people would rather go out and spend money on cute little kittens. Obviously the conditions for you adopting Lisa would be standard; she needs a stable forever home and a loving owner/friend. Right now she has a little kennel she can stay in forever but she has nothing in the way of friendship or company, and this is a cat that deserves (and could bring to someone) endless pleasure and happiness.

I respectfully request you upvote this thread in order to increase the chance of an Englander happening upon it who might be interested in adoption.

I would never ask normally but not really sure where else to turn and I figure if anyone can find this kitty a good home, Reddit can. It would absolutely break my heart if she was still there after twelve months, and right now it is looking like that will be the case. Obviously we won't be handing this cat over to just anyone and will make sure she finds the best and most loving home possible but she is an adult cat, avaliable for adoption, not for sale!

Also did I mention that this cat only has one eye, so I believe anyone who did adopt her could harvest an incomprehensible amount of karma?

so basically i understand that there was higher unemployment, divorce rates and a lowering of trade union support which would all lead to hate for Thatcher. but from my understanding what happened has actually been beneficial for the UK in the long run. 

Thatcher's policies have kept the UK relevant by moving away from mining and manufacturing, industries which were dying and wouldn't be around now anyway due to the cheap costs of importing from china. and moving into the financial sector which creates much higher revenue and economic growth than mining and manufacturing ever would.

lowering trade union membership has allowed HRM and ACAS to rise which have been proven to be more successful than TU's. 

Have the newspapers just blown up a small section of the UK that disagrees with her and attempted to show that as the whole of the UK's opinion?

Surely if they have the same interest rate then it makes no difference compared to if it just stayed in the one account.

UK Dota scene - how far we've come 
and the road ahead.

The UK Dota scene is rapidly picking up pace, with a very popular in-house league having already been set up but is it enough?


There is a handful of extremely dedicated people tirelessly working to grow  and improve the UK experience, the UK-DOTA in-house league is a breeding ground for good and great players rapidly and continually helping players grow their skills and teamwork. It allows cherry picking of amazing players for British teams and creates a community that any UK resident can just pick up and play a game without the risk of finding the dreaded non-English speaking player. The league admins keeps everything fairly civilised as there are real consequences to ""losing your rag"" so to speak more often than you should. It lets any professional teams easily identify stand-ins or replacement players when needs be and keeps both new players and high tier players in contact which helps both parties improve their game giving new players the vital experience to learn from and the higher skilled players a new set of eyes to their strategies and gameplay style. But limiting it to UK players limits learning. Each country or region has an evolving metagame that they lean toward. 


One way to address this issue would be to invite foreign teams for exhibition matches that teams from the UK league could compete in. Of course watching tournament matches such as the Defense or Starladder could also help improve the UK metagame but it isn't as effective as firsthand experience, anything discussed until it's just put into practice is just theory and the true results cannot be known until used as each team and player will react differently.


Another similar Idea could be to hold a ""world cup"" of sorts where admins of different countries in-house leagues could nominate 5-7 players (spare players could act as stand-ins) to play in a national team though this would take some coordination by both administrators and players, but then who wouldn't want to be able to brag how your country got one over on those foreign teams.


AS for the professional side of the UK scene there has never been a better time to step up and have a go. Dota2 is starting to be picked up at LAN tournaments  such as Epic.11 for the British teams to be able to come along and play but they need to take the next step  and enter the qualifiers for the international tournaments and get their names out there. Even if a team were to fall at the first hurdle they stood an infinitely better chance at the start of the path than never setting out on it at all. Out of the frying pan into the fire isn't necessarily a bad thing. Teams should be constantly looking for their next big challenge the worst that could happen is you lose and if so practice and push on. 


Getting one British team on the International stage would be a tremendous lift for the entire region. People would have someone to look up to closer to home than central Europe. There are more and more ways for teams to hit it big notable in the Defense qualifiers where last time 19 UK teams entered with CC and Enigma marking the 4th round as the highest UK entries. The monthly Big Point Battle which gives 512 teams the opportunity to qualify, and the Joindota open.


In this writers opinion the UK scene is fit to burst and that one event, maybe a UK team making it into an international competition or similarly the international teams looking up and taking notice of how well the UK league and community are set up could be the spark needed to shift a lot of focus and really pay off for everyone involved and personally I can't wait to see where the scene goes from here.",false,UKDota,t5_2uyoj,null,null,self,The entire UK dota article for Comp-dota,2,http://www.reddit.com/r/UKDota/comments/1ce6k4/the_entire_uk_dota_article_for_compdota/

Hi, I'm a recent Uni graduate looking to secure a role as a procurement/purchasing assistant within London.

**Education**

I have a Bachelor of Arts in Media, Culture, Technology from a top tier University in Australia. 

**Experience**

The bulk of my experience comes from my work as an Office Manager at a London based international consultancy where I worked at for close to a year. I was solely responsible for sourcing and purchasing branded and promotional material, office supplies including stationery and high volumes of SD cards, and catering and courier services. 

During my time there, I am most proud of the cost reduction program I undertook on my own initiative that led to savings totalling over £20,000 during my employment period, without any compromise in quality or service. 

This was done by successfully consolidating suppliers and strengthening relationships with key vendors, drafting detailed vendor performance records, market analysis, and improvement of the level of communication, all of which I used as leverage in negotiations. 

In this role, I also have experience in sourcing and composing successful tenders on e-Commerce websites such as AliBaba.com.  Finally, I also organised and streamlined the purchasing process by developing accurate usage and inventory statistics and providing feedback to suppliers regarding their purchasing systems. 

Aside from this, I also have over 5 years of experience in customer service and sales (face to face and over the phone).

**My Skills**

* Able to quickly develop rapport and build a loyal network of suppliers
* Unafraid to negotiate for the best value
* Strong written and verbal communication skills (fluent in both English and Russian)
* High interpersonal skills 
* Highly IT literate
* Excellent working knowledge of all MS Office products, including Excel 
* Typing speed has been measured at 81 WPM at 98% accuracy

**Please contact me by PM, and I will get back to you ASAP**

Possibly long-winded and rambly.

Think about it. The blistering form he had for us. The songs we sang about him when he inevitably scored. It makes my mouth water to think about a striking partnership so potent and deadly, that it would surely be one of the best in the BPL, if not the world. 

Sure, Torres has been given A LOT of stick this and last season, but 19 goals is not bad at all in all competitions. In fact, his poor form may even work in our favour if it means a cut-price deal is offered. Benitez may even help to persuade Torres to return to a team where he would be getting the service he needs and deserves, as shown by our staggering chances created and shots taken figures this season. 

Sturridge as a back-up striker? Perfect. He hasn't been in poor form of late anyway, so maybe he needs a rest or just time to settle in. 

How much would Torres cost? I would say less than £20m. Chelsea cannot justify a much higher price tag than that. With Carroll, hopefully, leaving it's not like we wouldn't have the money.

I truly enjoyed the 11th Doctor and wasn't sure why there are a lot of criticisms against Moffat but a few episodes into Series 2 I recognized a lot of rehashes of the same idea again and again in Doctor Who.

A few examples:

The Eleventh Hour is quite similar to The Empty Child/The Doctor Dances (Hospital scenes, Alien controlling speakers, etc.)

The Curse of the Black Spot (Not written by Mofatt but he's the head writer) is very similar to The Little Girl in the Fireplace (Repairing droids/Medical bay system jumping between time windows to fulfill what they're programmed to do).

Not to mention the similarities between the Silence and the Weeping Angels.

I guess stories and plots are recycled quite often in the industry and I have been watching too many episodes in a short period but this has negatively impacted my enjoyment of Doctor Who as it begins to look too formulaic and gimmicky to me.

Finally my finance situation is looking good for the future and I'll have some additional money, it won't be enough for a car so I started looking into motorbikes about a week ago and here I am.

Here's a list of what I plan on buying;  
  
**Motorbike 125cc**  (*Budget around £1000.00*)  

Opt.1 Yamaha YBR  
Opt.2 Honda CG125  
Opt.3 Suzuki EN 125  

  
**Safety Equipment**   (Total of below is £305.92)
  
Helmet - http://www.ghostbikes.com/products/4786-ls2-ff370-easy-flip-front-motorcycle-helmet.html  

Jacket &amp; Trousers - http://www.ghostbikes.com/products/ghostbikes.com-brands-black-2-piece-kits/5034-black-evolution-and-toxic-motorcycle-kit.html

**Miscellaneous** (*Budget around £200*)  
Tax  
MOT  
Anything else I've missed.  
   
     
Do you think my bike budget is a little too low? £1500 total is my goal as you can see. If you have any tips for improving this list and things to look out for when buying a new bike then please let me know. Also if you have any tips for CBT or new rider tips in general then I would really appreciate your input.  
       
Thanks!

He has a blue box, And always carried a Rose. He's followed by a wolf, Everywhere he goes.

To the future he flies, To see the Earth's demise. Where he found evil, In a human disguise. 

To the past he went, The Victorian age. Where ghost and a scrooge, Inspired a page.

Back to present day, A pig takes Earth by storm. He destroys the real foe, Aliens in human form.

He went to a museum, To find an extinct friend. The last of an empire, He sent to an end.

To a broadcasting satellite, That controls the human race. Where the quest for gold, Leads to a corrupt, cold place.

He crossed his own time line, As a Father's Day gift. But saving one dad, Was not worth the time shift.

World War II he goes, When hate killed the dove. A lost child is saved, By true mothers love.

He meets a criminal, Running from the past. It's greed doesn't change, So the run doesn't last.

So let the games being, It all ends in death. Hate hidden in plain sight, No hope is left.

He saves one thing, The Rose he held dear. It just came back, The bad wolf is here.

The wolf destroys the foe, The Rose can't take the strain. He sacrificed himself, He died in pain.

This is simply *my* opinion.  We’re all Whovians here, so I know we can agree that disliking one companion or another is not something to fight over.  I’m just looking for insight into why people like her or else for other people who agree that she is subpar.

That being said, let’s look into the other companions (only from the new series):

Rose – Admittedly, my favorite.  Many people criticize Rose as being a mere love interest for the Doctor.  For me, her love is her strength.  Being in love doesn’t make her weak; in fact, it gives her the strength to fight on, even to cross dimensions.  And it isn’t her only feature.  She’s brave, compassionate, and funny.  

Martha – Ah, Martha.  Strong, fierce, intelligent, and independent.  Not everyone’s cup of tea, but she did a good job, particularly during the Family of Blood story arc.  And when she found she could no longer travel with the Doctor, she walked away and didn't look back.  

Donna – I love Donna!  When she first appeared as The Bride, I thought I hated her.  Couldn’t have been more wrong.  It was great to have a companion with no romantic interest in the Doctor, a true friend.  Her sense of humor and determination to change her life really made her great.  Plus, she genuinely wanted to help people.  The Pompeii episode is a great example.

And then there is Amy.  My problems with Amy are myriad, but I’ll try to be concise.  To me, Amy’s personality boils down to sarcasm and sex appeal, and little to no substance.  In my opinion, if it weren't for the Doctor’s guilt over having left her, and the “too many empty rooms” mystery, he would have never chosen her as a companion.  She isn’t very smart, and often ends up in the “damsel-in-distress” role, forcing Rory and the Doctor to come and save her.  Her humor often comes off as hurtful to me.  She is petty, holding a mistake that cost her 32 years against a man who waited for her for 2000 years of his own free will.  And I mean, there is literally nothing Rory could have done about that.  I understand that the conditions surrounding her pregnancy and what happened with River were traumatizing.  That is absolutely no excuse for how she was treating Rory at the beginning of Asylum of the Daleks.  He’s a nurse for goodness’ sake!  He understands medical problems.  He had proven again and again how much he loved her, and she chose to lie to him about why she wanted a divorce instead of simply telling him the truth.  Why was adoption never an option in her mind?  And it’s no wonder the man is paranoid about her being in love with the Doctor, she *is* in love with him during her entire first season.  If it weren’t for the Doctor being such a good person, she would have left Rory in a heartbeat.   To me, the only good things she ever did were A) being kind to Vincent and B) begging to go back with Rory during their final episode.  But for me, it’s too little, too late to redeem her as a character.  I’m always saying to my friends: the best things about Amy Pond are Rory Williams and River Song.  

Since the beginning of the new season, I have fallen SO in love with Clara.  She’s like a breath of fresh air.  I’ve only seen up to Rings of Akhaten so far, but in that time she’s established herself as kind, compassionate, adventurous, incredibly smart, and she isn’t tripping all over herself being in love with the Doctor.  To be honest, I even like his behavior better since he’s taken her on.  Milk and cookies!  So cute!

Anyhow, I’ve just had all this Amy stuff on my chest for a long time, and I wanted to share with other people who might understand.  I kept waiting for her to improve, and it just never happened.  It is especially hard for me to talk to fans that have only seen the 11th Doctor’s seasons, and thus love Amy.  So….thoughts?

As a Scouser, even one who was not born then, this tragedy will always be in our hearts, and the 96 will never be forgotten.

Too many good people were lost that day, and now the rest of the world finally know the truth, the real truth, as to what happened 24 years ago.

My dad was there on the day, and the stories he tells makes your blood boil and your heart break at the same time. He knew from day one what had happened, and ever since I was old enough to understand, I've known too.

It's very rare that I see my dad cry, but he tears up when he talks about Hillsborough. He was one of the heroes that tried to save people, when the police were stopping ambulances from getting on the pitches. He was threatened with being arrested when he was helping people pull down the advertising to use as stretchers. He tried his best, as did everyone at that match, but 96 still had to needlessly die.

Every fan at that match was a hero in my eyes, and it disgusts me that they have had to endure 24 years of insults, lies and slander, when all they did was try to help.

And though I may not have been alive then, I'm proud of my city, and of my dad. I'm proud to be from a city where all differences are put aside in respect for those who didn't return, whether you be red or blue. I'm proud to be the son of a man who tried his best to save his fellow fans.

My dad probably doesn't realise that a massive reason why I look up to him is because of what he's told me about that day. I know he'll probably never tell me everything, as some things still hurt too much. But I'll always think he, and every other fan, was a hero that day.

There. I said it. I really cant understand what he wants to do with the club. One minute it's bringing in loads of talent. The next it's spending tons of money on talents to replace the talent he just brought in. I know he wants to win everything, but Roman can't understand that there is a moral understanding to winning? See Manchester City: I'm sure there are SOME fans who bleed City, yet they are characterized as plastic, money-whoring bandwagon-ers. I feel my beloved Chelsea is becoming the same way. 

Falcao. Schürrle. Cavani. All names mentioned as linked to Chelsea. Jose Mourinho as asked that he has full control of footballing operations. Roman says no. [Source]

10 managers in 10 years. No consistency. Enough on this topic. 

I feel like we would be better off without Roman honestly. You don't see Bayern Munich, Ajax, Borussia Dortmund, even Newcastle, spending on overhyped talent. Now now, before you get your panties in a bunch, Hazard, Mata, and Moses have been excellent signing. I believe they were worth their respective amounts. However, Torres was brought in by Roman, has been a huge flop for 50 Million. Oscar has only seen action in Europe TBH, and for the large price between 25-32 Million for a 21 year old seems a bit rash. 

Then there is the whole Lampard/Cole contract situation. Let the man play if he wants. I feel Lampard will take the best deal he can get, and rightfully so. He's played his tail off since 2001 and deserves to go out as a blue. Yet the press lines Roman up to be witholding Lampard a contract. It seems berserk and wrong. 

Again, these opinions are mine, and I may have some facts off the mark, leave a comment about what you think. I think its time Roman to do the hardest thing he has ever had to do: Not sack a manager, but himself.

I'll just say it plainly: I don't want Williams anywhere near our beloved club.. Here's why:

First off he is 28 years old and I'd rather us sign a younger defender who'll cost less. Because he's from Swansea who are currently doing well in the PL and because Arsenal are interested, it'd take a mighty fee to prise him from them, and he is just not worth that.. When you pay 15mil for a player you expect one of two things: A massive growth potential or instant impact, joe Allen has provided us with some potential but has lost much of his impact, whether he can turn it around next season remains to be seen.. As such, I am against paying top dollar for more overpriced Welsh footballers.. He is only 6'0 and is pretty slow.. Agger isn't the quickest but his defensive positioning and tackling abilities are top-notch.. Sadly, the same can't be said about Williams, who is nowhere near as good as the Dagger.. We need a quick yet strong complement to Dagger's ball-playing skills and tackling abilities.. Ogbonna and Dede, who are both 24, are 6'2 and 6'4 respectively and possess immense speed and strength.. Those are ideal partners for Agger, not Ashley Williams.. I am not so concerned about what Williams said about Suarez, but from them, we can tell that he doesn't exactly love Suarez as much as we do, and being a club with so few internal bust-ups we'd do well to not sign a player who would instantly bring more animosity into the dressing room.. Sorry Mr. Williams, but if you fulfilled your fantasies and punched Luis, Liverpool fans and players alike would descend upon you so quickly that you'd be dead within the hour.. 


So Brendan, I know that you'd love to buy the entire Swansea team as you've doubtlessly had some nice dinners and barbecues and team holidays together, but please note that hardly any, if any of them, are improvements to our current squad.. As such, please don't sign Ashley, please...
