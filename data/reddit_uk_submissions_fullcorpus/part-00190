My brother managed to move in with a friend, and my mum's boyfriend manages to move to another part of the country, which left me and my mum.

The day we were made homeless, my mum managed to talk with her sister, who agrees to take us in. 7 weeks or so past and we had to move out. This is where it was bad for me. Through panic and being massively misinformed, I suggested we look at private renting considering mum couldn't get anywhere through agencies as her credit score was bad and I didn't have a job (was on and still am on JSA). We managed to find a private flat in the same region, which mum signed the lease for (I never signed anything). Out of the bills, electric and gas was done through prepaid cards, but water and council tax was not. The problem is that to my knowledge she never declared either her or myself on the council tax, and to top it off, she suggested that her income be paid into my account as debt collectors wouldn't be able to touch it (I think it was suggested because we wouldn't able been able to survive). I'm mad at myself because I didn't think it was a big deal and thought it would've been okay. However, I'm worried because my JSA is paid into the same account (I only have one bank account), and if they saw what else went in, I would be liable to pay it back, and I'm also worries that I'm liable for council tax, even though I'm a dependent on my mum and can't afford to pay it back at the moment. Nothing else I know is in my name, and by extension meant I never signed for anything to do with the flat.

I'm desperate for advice and what my options might be. I know I need to get myself out of this situation asap, but I fear I won't be able to get emergency housing or DSS because of a bad decision I made when I was 19/20.

Also, I want to point out that I have repeatedly asked my mum what steps she is taking to sort her debts/situation out, and I've suggested stuff like selling her car or asking a friend or our nan if she could borrow money to declare herself bankrupt (that's something she decided to do a while back, but she hasn't made any effort to get another job (low income job) or try and sell things to get money together to declare herself. At this point I'm scared for my safety and future because I can't pay back anything if I do owe anything, and I don't have anyone I can turn to who could take me in for a while, meaning I would end up homeless.

As a side note, I have been trying to look for jobs and have done courses (funded by gov) since moving in to better my chances of getting a job. So yeah... What can I do, Reddit? Have my decisions affected my life or can I get out of this? :( if you think I missed anything off, please let me know and I will give more info.

Edit: when I've suggested stuff in the past to my mum, she's been very irrational, and pretty much shut the conversation down, and for some reason she think as soon as I get a job, she expects me to take over the lease and allow her to carry on living there illegally. She doesn't seem to understand that it could land me in a lot of stuff. To top it off, she suggested I open another banks account and try and get housing benefits paid into that. I refused and said they would absolutely check my other bank account and that it was not okay/legal to so that. Basically she's expecting me to carry this mess and and has expected me to do so for a while now. I just wish I knew my options earlier on and had information back before we moved here.
Also will I be in trouble for having mum's wages paid into my account whilst having JSA paid in there too?

Edit 2: I know there's a lot of irrelevant stuff in here, but I was typing the whole situation out as it happened. Sorry for the waffle.

TL;DR: mum and I made homeless (she had debts and bad credit). Mum signed new lease, didn't declare either one of us at the new place, didn't sort out water to my knowledge (other bills sorted though). I agreed to have her wages paid into my account (JSA gets paid into there as well) and there still being paid into there, and bills come from my account as well (but are all in her name).

England contributes a lot financially &amp; has a huge population. A weak Upper House as it is now is preferable because it prevents politiking &amp; preserves a strong advisory board. 

But the way I see it: 

* England, Wales, North Ireland &amp; Scotland all have their own strong national identities. Splitting up England into different regions won't erase this &amp; won't make the other constituent members of the Union think they're any less English.

* A huge foundation of the United Kingdom's identity is that it's constituent countries are equal members in the Union.

* Even if you split up England or devolve England, England will still dominate the Lower House, and by extension, the government. Even if you give proportional representation it will still feel like this to the other members *(in their opinion/view)*. 

* There is no proper &amp; authoritative Upper House to check the powers of the Lower House, and thus, England, at the determinant of the other constituent members own interests *(in their opinion/view)*. 

The only way, in my opinion, to reduce these problems, is by replacing the House of Lords with a British Senate. One, for example, with five members from each country *(so twenty members, and the Monarch or leader of the chamber can be entrusted with a tie-breaking vote)*. These members could be given ten years terms *(with one member of the delegation elected every two years)* so they don't have to worry about election campaigns so much, and even appointed by the state legislature to help prevent the politiking many are concerned about *(although I personally think popular election is the best)*.

This, of course, would also be accompanied by each state being completely devolved *ala* Spain to become a *de facto* Federation, or their autonomy enshrined in a constitution *ala* Germany, Australia &amp; the United States.

**Match Events**

**'19** Austin is played into the box by Antenucci, with plenty of work to do, but he rifles in a shot that seems to go in-between Smithies' arms! **GOAL FOR LEEDS!** Austin's resurgent form continues, as does Smithies' run of gaffes at Elland Road!

**'23** Berardi is shown a yellow card for catching a Huddersfield player with a late challenge. Leeds have to be careful with these aggressive challenges.

**'25** Bellusci is shown a yellow card for a wild challenge near the edge of the box. We need to calm down a bit if we're going to finish the game with 11 men!

**45+1** Leeds break a spell of Huddersfield possession to race down the other end of the pitch, with Antenucci feeding in Bellusci of all people, whose lob over the 'keeper rebounds off the crossbar and is BURIED by Antenucci on the follow-up. **GOAL FOR LEEDS!**

**Half-time: Leeds United 2 - 0 Huddersfield Town**

**'59** Substitution for Huddersfield as Danny Ward replaces Jonathan Hogg.

**'68** Austin plays Doukara into the box and he coolly rolls it past a despairing Smithies. **GOAL FOR LEEDS!**

**'69** Doukara is shown a yellow card for taking his shirt off while celebrating his goal. The whole world is now aware that he does indeed lift.

**'72** Berardi is **SENT OFF** following a second yellow card, with yet another late challenge on Bunn earning him an early bath. The smart money was always on either Bellusci or Hong Kong Berardi to break our run of games without a sending off.

**'73** Substitution for Huddersfield as Jonathan Stead is brought on for Sean Scannell.

**'74** Substitution for Leeds as Sam Byram comes on for Casper Sloth.

**'85** Substitution for Leeds as Steve Morison replaces Souleymane Doukara.

**'89** Lynch is shown a yellow card as Huddersfield finally get their first yellow of the game.

**'90+1** Substitution for Leeds as Michael Tonge is brought on for Rodolph Austin. It seems fairly obvious that this is an applause sub to boost Rudy's confidence, as the crowd give him a standing ovation.

The Scottish independence referendum is having significant effects on UK politics, even though Scotland has decided to stay in the union. Part of the referendum debate was the promise that Scotland would be granted greater autonomy, and now the other parts of the Union are demanding the same. 

In Wales and Northern Ireland this isn't too surprising, but controversially there is now a popular movement for a devolved England. The Prime Minister has indicated that this will happen, but in what form? And will he be able to pass such huge reforms, so near to the end of his term? The next General Election is looming on the horizon. If Scotland doesn't get devolution by then, I dare say the Scots will be somewhat miffed.

This is a complex issue with many variables. The different forms of devolution, the timetable of delivery, and the exact composition of powers which should be devolved are all significant debates.

The Government wants to bundle English devolution with Scottish devolution, thus putting significant time pressure on the England debate. Labour objects to this, wanting to shift the English issue into the next Parliament and only address Scottish devolution immediately. 

It's understandable why they would want this: if Labour manage to win the election, they'll be able to dictate the detail of English devolution, taking away the Tories' ability to do so now. There is significant political advantage in being able to determine that detail. It would also make Scottish devolution much easier to pass, placating Scotland sooner rather than later. Labour has good justification for their position, however: the complexity of the issue should give pause to politicians keen to push reform through at a sprint.

But Labour is playing a dangerous game. If the Tories win the next election outright (entirely possible, with Conservatives leading the polls) then their Government will be free from Lib Dem shackles and able to invoke popular mandate.  Labour would have even less power to negotiate than at present. Further, delaying could allow the Tories to depict Labour as opposing English devolution. That in itself could seriously damage Labour’s chances at the election.

There are three main forms of English devolution being discussed.

**Dual-purpose Westminster**

This is David Cameron's preferred form of devolution. In this system, Westminster Parliament remains the same: it is elected the same way and has the same powers. But MPs who represent areas outside of England would not vote on Bills regarding policy that only affects England. This option has the advantage of providing English devolution while making minimal disruption to the constitution, and would have the smallest costs in that no new institutions would have to be created. 

There are three main problems with the idea. 

Firstly, it would be possible (though rare) that the party with the most English MPs was different from the party with the most UK MPs. This would mean that the UK Government (composed of Ministers from the party with the most UK MPs) would have problems passing their largely English election manifesto.

A government without the ability to pass their legislation is considered a party without the confidence of the people and generally triggers another General Election. Historically, if the same party gets elected then it is considered the clear will of the people that the contested legislation be passed (this happened in 1910 after the House of Lords vetoed the 1909 budget). 

This historical remedy would not be able to resolve the issue of a dual Parliament, because the will of the people would not be made any clearer by re-election. The whole problem is that the will of the UK and the will of England conflict. A possible result of this reform would be regular coalition government, with all the problems that follow (most importantly, a shackled Government unable to enact the policy it was elected for, with national policy being determined by political deals rather than election manifestos).

The second problem with the dual-purpose Westminster is that many consider it to be too small a change. Those who object to the dominance of London see greater devolution to the regions of England to be the goal of devolution, not merely devolution to another London-dominated entity. This is seen as key in combating the level of inequality in our society, as the North of England is significantly more left-wing than the south.

The benefits and costs of London’s dominance of UK business, government and culture is a huge discussion in itself so I won’t go into detail here. In summary, the main benefit is the “economies of scale” argument. Proponents of London argue that it is not in competition with other English cities, but rather cities like New York, San Francisco, and Shanghai. London is our national champion for attracting international business. Reducing London’s dominance would not create other such champions; it would leave us with no champion. The pro-London camp also argues that London’s high incomes and businesses subsidise the rest of the UK. 

Critics of London, however, argue that London only subsidises the rest of the UK because it has received decades of preferential infrastructure spending and brain drain. They also point to the example of Germany as a developed, internationally competitive economy without any single “global city” that rivals London.

The third problem, related to the first, is the question of which MPs could become Government Ministers. While the Government would be officially the Government of the UK, much of their business would deal only with England. “English Bills for English MPs” risks making non-English MPs second-class citizens within Parliament, unable to take up UK executive roles.

The second form of English devolution being discussed is that of an English Parliament separate from the UK Parliament. It would have its own elections, MPs, and an English executive government, following the model of the Scottish Parliament, with the same powers.

The main problem with this is England’s size relative to the UK. The Scottish Parliament works because Scotland is a relatively small part of the UK. But an English Parliament with the same powers would begin to encroach on the authority of the Westminster government. While Westminster would maintain control over defence, foreign policy, and likely some measure of taxation, the English Parliament would have significant power in the shaping of domestic policy. This raises questions of who, exactly, is in charge of the UK: The Prime Minister, of the First Minister of England? The UK would have two de facto heads of government, and in the event of disagreement between the two, the UK could end up with a US-style governmental paralysis. 

Other arguments against an English Parliament are the costs of setting it up, and the same objections against the domination of London previously mentioned. One proposal is for the English Parliament to be based outside of London (York is a popular location), but it’s not clear how much this gesture would actually result in policy focus shifting away from London.

**Regional Devolution**

The third devolution proposal is the idea of devolving powers not to England as a whole but to an England divided up into regions (one rather romantic proposal is the resurrection of the old Anglo-Saxon Kingdoms as states). This is the federal option, a “United States of Britain and Northern Ireland”. England is by necessity divided, to avoid the problem resulting from England’s size relative to the UK as a whole. This problem was discussed above.

Each state would have its own elected legislature and executive. The exact powers of these states vary considerably between different proposals, but the most obvious answer is that they would be the same as those Scotland will have following their upcoming further devolution. These would include significant control over education, health care, transport, welfare, and taxation. Also unclear are the election mechanisms to be used in these regional parliaments (e.g. “first past the post” or “proportional representation”). 

This format is praised for reversing the dominance of London, allowing greater self-determination via regional Parliaments, but still maintaining a UK government for coordinated defence, foreign policy, and collective bargaining. (Though if each regional state had its own separate health care policy, it’s not clear that collective NHS bargaining would endure).

This option represents the most dramatic change to the UK constitution and it is unlikely to find political support in Westminster, especially among the Tories. It seems exceedingly unlikely that such a complex change could be made in the timetable that has been presented by the current Government.

Regional devolution also carries significant risks. One risk is that, rather than combating inequality, regional devolution would exacerbate it. With reduced fiscal transfers between regions via national taxation and investment, and with diverging education and healthcare systems, the system would create a kind of free market in governments. Successful regions would be able to keep their own tax revenue and reinvest it solely in their own region. Brain drain to successful regions would occur. The result would be entrenched regional inequalities, not a levelling out. This would be especially true of London, now able to hold on to its own significant tax revenues.

**Conclusion**

The question of devolution has no simple answer, and I hope this has helped some people see the complexities of the issue. It is important to also note that the devolution has revived other constitutional debates such as House of Lords reform and changing the electoral system away from “first past the post” (FPTP). However, it’s hard to imagine these two issues being addressed again in this Parliament. The House of Lords Reform Bill was dropped in 2012 after it failed to gain widespread political support, and a recent referendum regarding changing from FPTP to the Alternative Vote (AV) failed.

Bristol Scrabble Club is looking for new members and we have decided to organise an open evening to try and recruit new members en masse. We meet every week on a Wednesday evening and are currently average around 12 a night. We range in age from 25 to 80 and are a friendly bunch and we are putting together an open evening specifically to try and get a number of new recruits all in one go.

We have been struggling with sustaining new members and we think this is because of the fairly daunting experience of playing seasoned Scrabblers face-to-face. So we hope that bringing a few newbies together might allow them to grow within the group. 

As a personal testimony, I joined the club 8 years ago having played only on the Internet and with a 4 year hiatus in the middle, I have worked hard over the past year and am now ranked ~140th in the country. The transition from online play to real life is one I am happy to have made and now I far prefer playing face-to-face.

So if you are interested, please consider coming along. If you know of anyone who might be interested, please point them in our direction. We have a [Facebook Group](https://www.facebook.com/events/594110164042178/) set up for the event but for those without the details are as follows:

Wednesday 24th September - 19:15 to 22:00

Eden Grove, BS7 0PQ Bristol, United Kingdom

The most you need to bring with you is a pen. We have enough sets and tea and biscuits to supply most of Bristol.

I am currently planning my first vacation in over 10 years with a friend of mine with Cardiff as our destination. I was hoping to find some suggestion for where to go and what do to while there. One fixed destination so far is the Doctor Who Experience (she is a die hard fan), but we still plenty of time for other activities.   

So any suggestions? Especially some that are a bit less obvious than Cardiff Castle or the National Museum for example.  

Topics of special interest for me:
History, ruins, castles

Topics of special interest for her:
Doctor Who, Anything geeky, torture, redheads  

thanks in advance!  

edit: thanks for the many replies and tips so far! Our list of destinations is growing steadily.

###[**Manchester City**](/r/MCFC )  
  
**Manager:** [Manuel Pellegrini](http://www.uefa.com/MultimediaFiles/Photo/competitions/UCL/88/79/78/887978_w2.jpg)  
  
#Manchester City XI (4-2-3-1) from:  
Caballero, Hart, Wright, Boyata, Clichy, Demichelis, Kolarov, Kompany, Mangala, Nastasic, Sagna, Zabaleta, Fernandinho, Lampard, Milner, Nasri, Navas, Silva, Sinclair, Toure, Aguero, Dzeko.  
  
**FACTS:**

* The defending champions are seeking their first league win in three matches; failure to beat Chelsea would represent their worst run for 19 months, when they only earned two points out of a possible nine.
* City only dropped five points at home last season, winning 17 of their 19 fixtures and registering a league-high 52 points. They have already lost to Stoke this campaign.
* It is more than four years since City went two matches without a home win in the Premier League; they were held to successive goalless draws in November 2010 by Manchester United and Birmingham City.
* Manuel Pellegrini's side have not conceded a league goal before the 63rd minute so far this season. Only Aston Villa had a comparable record going into this weekend's fixtures.
* Summer signing Frank Lampard scored a club record 211 goals in 648 appearances for Chelsea.
* Joe Hart is expected to make his 200th Premier League appearance for Manchester City on Sunday.

**FACTS:**

* Chelsea are vying to start a Premier League season with five straight wins for the fourth time. They did so most recently in 2010 before losing away to Manchester City in the sixth game.
* They have won five consecutive away games in the league dating back to April.
* The Blues took 16 points out of a possible 18 against the other teams in the top four last season, including two wins over Manchester City.
* Diego Costa has scored a record seven goals in his first four Premier League games. Wayne Rooney has scored the most goals by any player after the first five games of a Premier League season, registering nine in 2011-12.
* Cesc Fabregas is the first player in Premier League history to provide a goal assist in six consecutive games. Only Eden Hazard got more for Chelsea last season with seven.

##Head To Head

* Chelsea condemned Manchester City to a first home Premier League defeat of the season last February, when Branislav Ivanovic scored the only goal. That result completed the league double over City.
* However, City beat Chelsea 2-0 in the FA Cup 12 days later - their fifth victory in the last six meetings at the Etihad Stadium.
* Chelsea have won 11 Premier League matches away at Manchester City, more than any other team.

I'd love to get some advice/a second opinion on a decision my wife &amp; I are thinking about making. 

Some context for you first. Our current property has risen in value over 2 years from the purchase price of £390k to £550k. Between us we earn £180k per year and our original plan was to move in Q3/4 of next year to what would be our 'forever' home whilst also renting our current property at around £2200 per month. Our plan would be to start having kids in 2016.

At present we have about £250k in total equity in our property and £50k in accessible cash. I was going through the process of re-mortgaging this property to save some money on the monthly repayments and lock in our rate before any interest rate rises occur. That worked out saving us about £100 per month with a £999 fee...so a negligible saving over the next year. Interest on the cash would equate to maybe £800 a year? Again a negligible return.

I was starting to think about how little return we're actually achieving for that amount of equity/cash and thought about buying another property now for a stronger return through letting.

Here's my math:

At £450k purchase price we'd need to invest £160k and at £500k invest £175k. This number factors in £30k renovation &amp; legal fees, stamp duty and 3 months mortgage payments at 3.9% (£4,782.00 @ 450k and £5,307.00 @ 500k).

For the sake of convenience assuming we got tenants in January 1st 2015. The property would make the following profit deducting mortgage payments only:

* £450k @ £2000 p/m = £4,872.00 per year or  3.03% Per year
* £450k @ £2500 p/m = £10,872.00 per year or 6.76% Per year
* £500k @ £2000 p/m = £2,772.00 per year or 1.58% Per year
* £500k @ £2500 p/m = £8,772.00 per year or 5% Per year

Here are my questions:

I'd like to get those numbers as accurate as possible and would want to work out an accurate projection on what of the investment and return would be tax deductible from our earnings. (And how I can fit that into excel!) 

From experience should anyone ever look at a BTL investment over just a 1 or 2 year period? It's high risk in terms of the total number invested.

Generally, given that this would take a big chunk out of our savings and set back the 'forever' home move. What are your thoughts? It's unlikely we'll get to a point of having this much money available to play with again for a while (particularly when kids come along!). From a short term perspective the return is low, but over a long term, particularly if you factor in equity getting paid off and viewing those returns over a 10 year period (potentially £100k+ over 10 years) it's a meaningful number.

Most people on IMDB like Moffat better so it is interesting to see this subreddit's opinion since a lot of people in this subreddit prefer RTD over Moffat. So, my ratings for the Matt/Moffat Era since I haven't watched the RTD ones yet.

**Series 5** : 7.69 : A great start to the Moffat era and a great feel for what his vision on Doctor Who is. Ratio of great episodes to duds was even and I enjoyed it tremendously. I was also more hooked to this than the first episode of RTD's era since it felt much more sci-fi and it was what I envisioned Doctor Who to be. My only problem with this is it could've been more streamlined and cohesive.

**Series 6** : 7.82 : I might get a lot of flack for this but I liked this more than Series 5. It had much better episodes and I felt it was Moffat refined. I do get why people don't like it as much though. The finale felt like it was cheating and the arc was pretty complicated. I liked the complicated aspect of it though and I felt that it worked good as individual episodes but it was even better when viewed as a whole.

**Series 7** : 7.59 : Meh season and was a bit disappointed by it. It felt really messy and it doesn't really have any much plot. I feel that during this series, they focused on spectacle more which I didn't like one bit. Still, I appreciate what they were trying to do and if the execution was nice, it would have probably been a great season.

So, rank the series and even rank individual episodes if you like. Now, I'll start watching the RTD era.

""Then Rigobert gave me Gerrard's shirt from that day and I have kept it. I was training every single day in it. I have still got the shirt.

What did you think of the game? The starting XI/subs? When will Adryan make his eagerly awaited debut? 

**My Opinions**

The game. Was. Fantastic. Our defence threw themselves at the ball, kept them out and not only did we dominate the ball for large portions and play actual football, we smashed them a few times on the break - everything is looking very positive for the future.

Honestly, I think Adryan will make his debut next home game. He was warming up all games and looks to have a good relationship with the squad. Think he would've come on for Austin, if Austin's early end was a but sooner. 

Personally, Berardi should have been off at HT. I was eager to see Sam and Berardi looked dangerous - not in a good way. Apparently Sam was gonna come on before the card, but was delayed because he'd left something in the changing room. Source: The incredible wisdom of a possibly drunk fellow leaving the ground as I was.

Austin is better than he's ever been for us. I'm excited by him this season, no homo. He did a stepover today. A STEPOVER! 5* skills on fifa 16 confirmed.

Why is Bellusci a CB? He can dribble like a pro and shoot. Unlucky to hit the bar today.",false,LeedsUnited,t5_2teb8,null,null,self,[Post-match discussion thread] LEEDS UNITED:3-0:Huddersfield Town,13,http://www.reddit.com/r/LeedsUnited/comments/2gyzkr/postmatch_discussion_thread_leeds/

On the comments section of articles on the BBC, Daily Mail and elsewhere, there seems to be a consensus that Scotland is being subsidised by the remainder of the UK, and is only able to support policies such as free university education as a result of tax paid elsewhere. One comment, for instance, made the suggestion that it was fair that Scotland should be able to raise its own income, but that the problem arose in Scotland being fond of spending other people's money.

This is plain wrong. The Scottish government publishes Government Expenditures and Revenues in Scotland every year, which details how much tax is raised in Scotland and how much public expenditure we receive. This report is independently assessed by the United Kingdom Statistics Authority, so is an accredited National Statistics publication. According to GERS, for four out of the last five years more tax revenue has been generated in Scotland than we have received back in public expenditure. Read for yourself here: http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Topics/Statistics/Browse/Economy/GERS

Why do so many people believe Scotland receives more than its fair share of public expenditure? Where are they getting their information from?

Edit: Thanks so much for the input guys! I'm going to sleep now so won't be responding to any more comments till tomorrow.

I say 'pleasantly surprised' - I mean f*cking amazing. In this story, the Doc and Clara find themselves bound up in a caper to knock off the biggest, most fortified and generally scary bank in the galaxy. Their memories have been wiped via the magic of mindworm and they've somehow entered into partnership with two fellow amnesiacs, a cyborg hacker and a shapeshifting mutant. What could go possibly wrong? 

Well, apart from having security measures to protect its security measures, the bank also has a very scary secret weapon - an enslaved psychic being known as the Teller, who can tell if you have any guilty feelings. (Like wanting to knock off the aforementioned bank.) So how do you rob this bank? Even the Doctor doesn't seem to have a clue, and there's a very big solar storm on its way too...

Why does it work? Firstly, it is intricately plotted, well executed and with wonderful characterisation. Here we have a time travel episode that finally uses its conceit to enhance the narrative rather than just be a gimmick. Secondly, it really benefits from the cinematic sweep the new series has developed in place of the more intimate, slow-paced fashion of the old show.

Here, at last, we have a Who episode that benefits from the post-2005 bombast and pace. In fact, and in many ways, it's the best episode since 'The End of the World', the one moment RTD managed to strike a balance between his megalomaniac fan-fic urges and the old show's heart and soul and still make it compelling, excellent television.

The show even manages to fox the viewer, with some bolted-on wangst between the Doctor and the cyber-hacker Psi (Jonathan Bailey), and a denouement that threatens to be yet another 'The Doctor is a Shit' story, only to reveal all in the last act and make the show, for once, generally inspiring and, y'know, *fun*.

You see, this is the first time in ages that the Doctor has been a hero (his offstage martyrdom on Trenzalore doesn't count because Moffat sped through it via a narrative fast-forward), as befits - y'know - the title character in a show where he's traditionally been the good guy, and also the cunning fox rather than the sidelined arse. 

The only downside to this is that while the other two accomplices are well-fleshed out and dynamic, Clara is almost completely sidelined. She serves little purpose, other than to find a set of codes and then give them to the Doc, and while she's not an arsehole this episode (give or take some cringeworthy school drama with herself and Danny Pink), she's not much of anything else. 

It's like the only two options for Clara is to be furniture or irritant, which suggests the episode was written as a generic Who episode by Stephen Thompson (who does a very good job here) and then had the 12th Doctor bits bolted on by Steven Moffat. (That's a lot of Steves.) Which is odd, because Saibra the shape-shifter (Pippa Bennett-Warner) and main antagonist (in more ways than one) Mrs. Delphox (Keeley Hawes) do actually have personalities. You can guess where one author stopped and the other started.

All in all though, this is the first proper Doctor Who we've had in a long time; it is Peter Capaldi's proper coronation, but surely will be the exception that proves the rule in an otherwise truly tepid series... right?

Today I took the Arsenal travel coach up to your beautiful stadium. Your hospitality, atmosphere and most of all the football completely blew me away. 

Back home in Australia we have ATMs and food which can paid by with card, you do not, so I found out. We walked into the stadium like the clueless tourists we are expecting to get a feed before kick off only to find out we couldn't because we had no cash. We asked the nearest steward where the nearest ATM was only to be told ""nowhere"". After chatting to him for a little bit he told us to ""wait here and he'd be back in 2 secs"". Maybe he had a love for the Aussie accents or because he mentioned he had friends in Australia, either way he came back with a meat pie for us both. 

You'd never get that back home. I was absolutely astonished that someone who I'd just met would pull some strings and do that for some tourists. 

We sat in the Doug Ellis stand as per suggestion, M4 row c. Incredible. I couldn't believe how close to the pitch we were. And how little there was between us and the grass. Most stadiums in Australia have a 1 meter fence all the way around and then advertising boards and then the pitch up to about 10 meters away in some stadiums. Couldn't have asked for any better other than away end seats, but that was never going to happen as a tourist. Being near the Holte End was fantastic. The ""Villa, Villa, Villa"" chant before Arsenal scored and you got quite was amazing. 

Only a few teams in Australia come remotely close to what you had going, and of those few teams they only produce in the derbys. (look up Sydney FC vs Western Sydney Wanders derby for an example for those interested) Overall the best atmosphere I've experienced. 

To top it all off Arsenal win 3-0. Now I know that won't go down well on this sub, but after all I'm Arsenal fan. The level that football is played at is amazing when I'm used to seeing Heskey come to my local club (Newcastle Jets) and being seen as a marquee signing and one to bring ""class"" to our simple league. And I know full well that you know full well what it's like having him around. Seriously though seeing some of my favourite players in the flesh zipping balls around the pitch was mesmerising. Some of your blokes weren't to bad either I guess..

If you have been bothered to read all this much appreciated, I should have been trying to get rid of this jet lag rather than sitting up writing all this out.

Thank you so much for this experience. I'll never forget this one.",false,avfc,t5_2s569,null,null,self,Thank you,25,http://www.reddit.com/r/avfc/comments/2gzgr3/thank_you/

Kick off time at White Hart Lane: 13:30 (GMT), 1:30 (BST), 8:30 (EST)

TV: NBC Premier League Extra Time, not being televised in the UK :/

Referee: Kevin Friend

Betting Odds: Home 8-15 Away 13-2 Draw 7-2

Team News: **Andros Townsend** (Doubtful), **Kyle Walker** (Out)

-No one is injured for West Brom

Back to back draws on the road for Spurs as we finally return home to the Lane. A tie against Sunderland in a match we should've won, and a 0-0 tie with Parizan in Old Yugoslavia isn't the worst result in the world. Hopefully the home fans can help us get back to winning.

Last season we definitely disappointed against West Bromwich Albion. We tied them twice, and we only tied because **Christian Eriksen** saved our ass in both games. We drew 1-1 with West Brom the day after Christmas, but only thanks to [this amazing free kick](http://gfycat.com/SlimReflectingFritillarybutterfly) from Eriksen. It was his first Premier League goal for Tottenham. In April we came from 3-0 down to tie draw with the Baggies at The Hawthorns. A **Jonas Olsson** own goal, **Harry Kane** not-own-goal, and [the Great Dane's 90th minute equalizer](http://gfycat.com/CookedGrippingBichonfrise) salvaged us a 3-3 sharing of the points.

Tomorrow we need to be better from the start. No going behind. We need to come out like we did against Sunderland, but when we go 1-0 we need to stay awake defensively and kill the game off with a second goal.  I'm expecting the team to come out and pressure the fuck out of these Baggies.

------------------------------
My Starting 11 Prediction: 
------------------------------

Lloris

Dier - Kaboul - Vertonghen - Rose

Capoue - Dembele

Lamela - Eriksen - Chadli

Adebayor

-I'd say  **Kaboul** undoubtedly starts after not making the trip to Serbia and being named captain. Maybe Pochettino starts **Chiriches** this match, I wouldn't be opposed to that at all. But I'm gonna guess he'll start **Vertonghen**. 

-I don't want us to have the **Adebayor**, **Soldado** debate again, because it's been argued to death on this subreddit. There's a chance **Soldado** starts this game, I personally would love that. But I understand why others would be opposed and want to see **Adebayor**. I'd be confident in either of them starting.

-West Brom have some quality players in their team. **Stéphane Sessègnon** scored against us last year, and **Saido Berahino** already has two goals this season. They've also brought in ex-Celtic man Georgios Samaras. 

------------------------------
Discuss!
------------------------------

-How would you deal with fitness in our back 4? Who would you start?

-What can we expect out of West Brom in this one? 

-Are you scared of any West Brom players?

-Dembele surely has solidified himself a starting place after last week's performance...right?

The following will be posted to both /r/soccer and /r/LiverpoolFC, and is an analysis of Liverpool's defensive structure during the first goal of the recent match vs West Ham.


The first goal came after a setpiece created by a somewhat clumsy challenge by Alberto Moreno almost hugging the sideline after a throw-in. While avoidable, it's not going to be the focus of this analysis. Instead I will jump straight to right before the free-kick comes in from Downing. [Here we can see Skrtel pointing to James Tomkins](http://i.imgur.com/iRfl2SL.png) (West Ham's number 5), and Henderson seemingly asserting that he's got his man and telling Skrtel to cover the area infront of Henderson. As the freekick comes in, we can see that Henderson [quickly loses Tomkins](http://i.imgur.com/JZEvo7g.png) (ball in the red circle), who is already now effectively alone to reach the ball. [When the ball closes in, Henderson has Tomkins behind himself and can only see the ball, Skrtel and Mignolet has lost sight of the ball](http://i.imgur.com/tA0S77c.png), , and [Henderson is crushed in the duel by Tomkins](http://i.imgur.com/VY84p1m.png) – he doesn't manage to jump for the ball as he's completely lost sight of his man.

Once the ball is won by Tomkins, it's headed straight in towards the open goal. Understandably, Mignolet has come out to defend his post and Skrtel is defending the second ball. But where are the rest of the Liverpool-defenders? As we can see here, [Winston Reid is completely unmarked in the middle of the Liverpool box.](http://i.imgur.com/bXfivqX.png) 

[When the free-kick is delivered](http://i.imgur.com/waxYYHO.png) (Reid encircled), at least four people (Balotelli, Lovren, Manquillo and Skrtel) have some claim to the area which seconds later is undefended. However, when we look at Liverpool's structure: Henderson is covering Tomkins; Manquillo, Lovren and Gerrard are all holding specific West Ham players; Balotelli, Skrtel and Lucas are marking no-one. Henderson is pointing for Skrtel to cover Reid, but to no avail. This results in, as we can see, seven Liverpool-players marking four West Ham-players, while Skrtel, Balotelli and Lucas are defending their respective zones. [Reid makes a smart run in front of Manquillo, but behind Lovren, both of whom are busy with their own man](http://i.imgur.com/dIDnbVX.png), and as the box looses up, Reid is [casually strolling unmarked in the middle of the Liverpool box.](http://i.imgur.com/FdetMGb.png)

I've numbered each Liverpool-player in this picture so we can have a look at what each one is doing individually. [(The picture again if you closed it)](http://i.imgur.com/FdetMGb.png)

1. is Mario Balotelli, who is covering Kouyate: however Balotelli is standing behind his man and if the ball is headed in his direction, Kouyate will get there first and Balotelli doesn't seem particularly concerned about this.

2. is Dejan Lovren, who is also covering Kouyate, although if the ball comes across, Lovren will most likely make it before Kouyate, making Mario's already pointless, half-assed marking even more unnecessary. 

3. is Lucas, who is covering a decent area if the ball is to get cleared, having time to close down the West Ham-player at the top left of the image.

4. is Manquillo, who is the only Liverpool-player in the picture who actually is looking at his man. He is, as far as I can tell, not at fault for what happens next.

5. is Skrtel, who I guess a lot of Liverpool-fans will blame for this goal. Myself, however, being equally biased but the other way around (I actually like Skrtel), think he's covering the right area. If contact in the duel between Henderson and Tomkins isn't direct enough, he's there to cover the second ball and he's also placed himself so that he may be in the balls trajectory across the goal.

6. is Henderson, who's lost his man and will soon lose the duel leading to get assist for Tomkins.


Now to the important part of any problem; finding out who to point the pitchforks too. Other than the obvious, I think the problem here lies with Lovren and Balotelli. As soon as it's evident that the ball will reach the far post, Lovren (2) and Balotelli (1) need to [push across the field like this](http://i.imgur.com/plGmq4F.png), so that Balotelli gets between the ball and Kouyate, covering the blue area, while Lovren gets ahead of Reid and covers the red area.

The only other alternatives would be for either Lucas follow Reid from the start, which would lead to the West Ham-player at the top left of the image to have free time on the ball in case of a clearance, or for Skrtel to do it. If Skrtel were to track back to this area, however, he would either have to A) turn around, get a look at the man but lose sight of the ball which would leave him unprepared to deal with it, or B) backtrack, lose sight of his man and be off balance.

An even better solution might of course be to put an extra man inside the box, because if you want to run man-marking then you CAN NOT LET A MAN GO FREE. The conclusion of all this is that Liverpool SORELY NEED a coach who specializes in defending set-pieces, because at the moment it's not just individual errors, but it looks like we as a team have very little cohesion and no real plan for dealing with situations like this.",false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,null,null,self,Analysis: our defensive positioning prior to and during West Ham's opening goal,51,http://www.reddit.com/r/LiverpoolFC/comments/2gzysw/analysis_our_defensive_positioning_prior_to_and/

By assessing people's abilities ahead of their disabilities, and trying to get people who could theoretically do some work into work... it's commendable in some ways.

But it flies in the face of the employment market and all logic pertaining to that. While a person with a dodgy back might fare ok in an ergonomic office chair, a person with learning difficulties could lug bricks for a building company, and a person in a wheelchair could represent a company in meetings (provided they're in accessible places), employers aren't going to be able to sustainably afford to accommodate for everyone. Also, there's more risk involved. Someone who sees a doctor often will take time out from work. Someone who needs simple tasks to be explained repeatedly is going to soak up their in-work time, as well as other employees' time. Someone whose social difficulties make them somewhat absent-minded and also quite prone to stress is not going to be good at dealing with customers for hours without frequent breaks.

Employers who hire people with disabilities are taking a gamble. Sometimes it pays off, sometimes it doesn't. But most would much rather not do so in the first place. The government is focusing this drive squarely on disabled people themselves, which means they're trying to get people who have a limited pool of potential jobs they *could* do, to face this hostile job market and apply for absolutely anything... leaving them with all the stress involved in trying to get a job, but little chance of actually getting a job, and no training to make them more suitable for the jobs they theoretically could do.

Instead, the government should be focusing on the employers, pushing them to make accommodations for a variety of potential disabilities and verifying workplaces and employers for disability-friendliness. Not only could this mean a wider variety of potential work for people with disabilities, but it can also offer itself to providing the government with a criteria-matching scheme, which would make it easier to work out whether job x is suitable for client y, and provide some further access for client y to meet the job requirements for job x.

tl;dr: I think it's commendable to be thinking about disability in terms of 'differently-abled' as opposed to 'disabled', but the government need to approach this from a completely different direction, because all they're currently doing is making lives hell.",false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,null,null,self,Disability - The Elephant in the Room,16,http://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/2gzyun/disability_the_elephant_in_the_room/

The problem?

I have been trawling the web for some time looking for good dealers for the above, but frankly it is an arduous and not terribly fruitful quest at the moment. Many of the websites feel like they were designed 10 years ago, and provide minimal information at best. Does anyone know any good and reliable places that might stock the following:

Mustang seats
Saddlemen seats
Corbin seats

Aftermarket, or official Yamaha, pillion backrests and luggage racks that are compatible with the stock saddlebag supports.

I've been in this dilemma for ages and digging through the reddit archives has been unsuccessful. So I'll fill you in:

I'm a computer science engineer with 4 years of web/graphic design and development. While freelancing and as part of a company. I've worked for brands such as MTV, Sony Ericsson etc. I can design, develop using the latest technologies and handle the entire life-cycle of projects. I'm a Non-EU citizen.

I really want to move to the UK because I've been a huge football fan since childhood and just adore the country in general.

What would be the best route to get in the UK? I've thought of some options such as :
i] Doing a masters' and applying for a job - but have a few friends who couldn't land one. The cost of education would be too much to bare if I don't land a job post-study. Though I'm confident about my skills that i can land a job worth more than 22k a year, IF it were available. But that *IF* is what I'm most concerned about.


ii] Would I be better off looking at job agencies or the gloomy route of scouting job sites, sending thousands of applications and them backing out the moment they realize I'm not a UK citizen. 

I'm 26 and really running out of time, need some direction. Any input would be hugely appreciated.

We may not get top four this year, that's everyone's worry. I'm sure that is warranted, because some players won't want to stay, well, fuck it. Whoever stays, stays, lets enjoy the champions league and hope we are playing it next year.

Gerrard is going to get shit. All. Fucking. Year. It's going to happen. We gotta get over it and not let it bother us, and not be babies about people talking shit. He slipped, we lost the title.

Yes that game was embarrassing and shocking to say the least. But lets see what happened. When we played Southampton they had a new play style and a new manager so it was gonna be a tricky game but we managed to scrape that win. expecting a win away at City was a long shot to be honest as the team we are fielding still needs time to gel together, then we had Tottenham and we looked like the standard attack and form we expected from last season allowing spurs only one shot on target. Then the international break happened, I'm not aiming this at Roy but more, we found our flow and then had 2 weeks off, most of our key players going off learning a different style. Flow disrupted.

So then we come home to Aston Villa expecting an automatic win, but instead Villa got an early goal and after that we attacked them the whole game but just couldn't find that creativity to at least get a draw. I think by now you can see what's happened. We have our first Champions Laague game midweek and I honestly think we were just a little burned out, thus our midfield was near non-exist yesterday. Remember city and Chelsea had a bad start to the Prem last season and they managed to find their feet. All I'm trying to say is, if by mid october we haven't found consistency, then we should panic. But right now lets just take step back and [calm down](http://gfycat.com/SecondUnfitCutworm), and hope Brendan knows what to do to get this turned around, on the bright side we should have Sturridge back for the derby.

TL:DR; the intentional break killed our flow, team needs a little longer to gel, adjusting to midweek fixtures, Brendan will hopefully fix this, Sturridge back soon.",false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,null,null,self,"These last 5 Premier league games, what we should consider.",0,http://www.reddit.com/r/LiverpoolFC/comments/2h0nm3/these_last_5_premier_league_games_what_we_should/

I could make a starting XI with seven substitutes made up of released or sold under-21 players from 2010/11 to 2014/15. I really could. That just proves that we have really talented youngsters, but only a few make it. Fine, not all of them are destined for the Premier League. Fine, not all of them are world class. But we can solve that.

We can solve that by actually keeping them. I know, it's unlikely we'll be starting a bunch of second-year scholars in a big match. But, this is what the development squad is far. At the moment, the majority are all under-21s and young pros. But Nick Haycock should be really playing a few Second-year scholars, and even a few First-years. This way it will give them good experience seeing as some Development squads have first-team players featuring for them.

Hopefully, the ones who sign professional contracts **stay** with us, and most of the second-years do so too. The most recent professionals, well, they are all outstanding.

* [Amos NASHA](http://www.whufc.com/javaImages/1c/4e/0,,12562~12209692,00.jpg) - This guy can either play at centre-back or in the central midfield. Either way, he is a solid player and one to keep.

* [Jamie HARNEY](http://www.whufc.com/javaImages/f1/4d/0,,12562~12209649,00.jpg) - Again, like Nasha, Harney is a reliable centre-back and a superb tackler.

* [Josh CULLEN](http://www.whufc.com/javaImages/c9/23/0,,12562~12198857,00.jpg) - Silky midfielder. One to definitely keep.

* [Kieran BYWATER](http://www.whufc.com/javaImages/15/4e/0,,12562~12209685,00.jpg) - You should have heard of him now. This guy is definitely one of our future stars. That is, if he doesn't get released or sold.

* [Lewis PAGE](http://www.whufc.com/javaImages/1a/90/0,,12562~12357658,00.jpg) - Brilliant left-back.

* [Moses MAKASI](http://www.whufc.com/javaImages/2/4e/0,,12562~12209666,00.jpg) - This guy...is pure class. We better keep him, he is outstanding. Personally my favourite.

* [Nathan MAVILA](http://www.whufc.com/javaImages/db/4d/0,,12562~12209627,00.jpg) - Left-back or left-winger. Either way is amazing. Again, definitely should keep him.

So hopefully these seven will all stay with us. Now, I promised an XI of released players, didn't I? Here it is.

So there you are. Sadly, some of please I have no clue whatsoever where they are. Others, like Robert Hall &amp; Dominic Vose (who I did not include) are playing for Bolton Wanders &amp; Colchester respectively. And believe it or not, Lamar Hurley is now working as a motivational speaker!

Most released players seem to go to local clubs. Good examples include young full back Courtney Homans, who is now at AFC Hornchurch. Then there's a few playing for Billericay, Canvey Island and Concord Rangers. Some go on to be quite successful. As I mentioned earlier Dominic Vose is at Colchester and Rob Hall is at Brighton, along with Nana Boakye-Yiadom at Barnsley.

Some I believe, may have given up altogether. I do not know much what's happened to Dymon Labonne, Frazer Shaw, Paco Craig and Thomas Gogo. I think I read somewhere that Paco has gone to America and started playing American Football!

Back to why we should keep players. Loyalty. Some are fans of the club. ""And?"", you may think. If they are a supporter, that will make them loyal. Then, we can nurture them into a big talent and they'll probably stay with us. Young centre-back Emmanuel Onariase (who I hope we keep), is a West Ham fan. In an [interview](http://www.whufc.com/articles/20130209/onariase-on-a-roll_2236884_3066993) he stated he wants to be Captain. That's brilliant spirit. And he's a quality centre-back, too.

Anyway, my rant is over. I hope you find this useful.

As i will be visiting London around new years time it would be a huge plaesure for me to experience the joy of a chelsea game!

Is there any chance to get 2 tickets for this game?
Moreover, i would be very happy to sit amongst other chelsea fans.
As i do not know how the seating is organized in the BPL here are my questions:

1. Will there be an away sector and what are my chances to get a ticket for this area?
2. Where can i purchase these tickets?
3. Are there mixed zones so i don't get ""bad looks"" or worse for celebrating chelsea goals, as there will be plenty ;) ?

Till recently I was under the impression credit cards were bad but I'm now realising I should have one to build my credit rating, is this correct? Have I left this too late?

If so, when I get one, do I have to use it or can I leave it to one side and still build a good score, I'm not entirely sure how it works?

Lastly, how do I find my credit rating? I'd be curious to know what it is now if possible.

If you disagree educate me!

Last night I witnessed a Glaswegian in Glasgow having a huge rant about Westminster stealing Scotland's oil. This begs the question - what makes it Scotland's?

He seems under the impression it is not a national resource to be shared. It should be local. Surely Scotland would be stealing the oil by the same logic should independence have happened?

Now it would be fair comment if those areas that do have it find themselves happy to share with Scotland but not the UK. In that case sure, the UK is stealing it, where as Scotland would have it shared by choice. Except Shetland &amp; Aberdeenshire had two of the lowest Yes votes...

But before I can even do that I need to get comfortable on the bike so that I'm not a danger to myself or others on the track / being too slow and holding people up.

Does anybody have ideas on where I might be able to do that as an unlicensed rider?

For example, I used to ride in construction safety boots, I've never worn mx boots before and I think it's going to take me a while just to get out of first gear!

It felt like we were both one country and four countries at the same time.

But since the result came in, it’s like I’ve woken up every morning in a different state altogether. Scotland, and the other nations seem much more distant from each other despite the unionist victory, the constitution is up for grabs, and the UK as a whole feels much weaker.

----------------------

**SCORE:**    
**Tottenham: 0 - West Brom: 1**

**Spurs starting lineup:** Lloris, Dier, Kaboul (c), Chiriches, Rose; Capoue, Dembele; Chadli, Eriksen, Lamela; Adebayor

**West Brom staring lineup:** Foster, Wisdom, Dawson, Lescott, Pocognoli, Dorrans, Morrison, Gardner, Brunt, Sessegnon, Berahino.

----------------------

**1st Half**

'8 - West Brom is working the right flank. Forcing Chiriches into putting it out for a corner. Corner comes in from Brunt who misses Lescott. Kaboul clears. 

'11 - Lamela crosses from the right flank for Ade who just can't get into the right channel.

'13 - Corner for West Brom. Taken short from the left and Garner gets a chance to square up on Lloris. Beautiful strike that Lloris pushes out wide.  **I LOVE YOU HUGO!**

'15 - Commentator informs us that West Brom has never won at WHL. WHY WOULD YOU SAY THIS? Also important to notate that Capoue broke up a developing play in the middle. 

'17 - Lamela to Eriksen who fumbles up the ball 20 yards out. Ade with great instinct to run into a channel. 

'19 - Poch spotted in his tracksuit. No accompanying music. 

'22 - Capoue drags down Sessignon (sp?) in WB's half. No card given. 

'25 - Ade trips over his own feet. Perhaps still a little un-coordinated after his hair-cut. 

'28 - Lamela brought down by Pocognoli. No card given. Dembele is given a foul almost right after. 

'30 - Kaboul conedes a corner with a well-timed tackle. Dawson flicks the ball on across the frame and the West Brom players shout for a hand-ball. None given and Spurs on the counter. *In review: Definite hand-ball by Ade*

'33 - A back-pass to Lloris sees him move the ball out to Chiriches who fails to control the ball. The counter from West Brom leads to nil.

'33 - Capoue concedes a foul in an attempt to win the ball. West Brom's free-kick routine leads to a goal kick. 

'35 - Eriksen with a sublime pass to Ade who just can't do enough to get on the end of it as Lescott comes in and clears the ball with a sliding tackle. 

'26 - **GOAL** for West Brom called back for **OFFSIDE**. Berahino a hair off-side as the cross comes in from the middle of the park. 

'39  - Rose puts in a low cross that concedes a corner to West Brom. Corner drives us back up the pitch.

'41 - Rose concedes a foul in the left corner. Lots of expletives picked up by the boom mic. Free kick is gathered by Lloris without contest. 

'42 - Chadli lays off a pass to Eriksen who has a strike. Lescott gets his feet in and concedes a corner. Header from the corner goes over the bar. 

'44 - Eriksen cuts some space out for himself. Adebayor misses a perfect opportunity to just slide the ball in with his head. 

'45 - Official calls up for half-time. I'll throw some of my own notes in and what you guys are saying in a sec. 

-----------------------------------
**Stats after the first half:** 

Possession: 64%/35% in favour of Spurs    
Total Attempts: 5 - 3 in favour of West Brom    
Attempts on Target: 1--0 in favour of West Brom    
Fouls Committed: 6-2 in favour of Spurs    
Corners: 5-3 in favour of West Brom    

-----------------

**What we're saying:**

**Adebayor:** Not looked good. Missed two sitters and hasn't had that spark we're expecting. Almost gave away a PK.    
**Lamela:** Moments of quality, but appears to be plagued with Townsend flu.    
**Chiriches:** Plays like me on my Sunday team. Lots of foot-work that really gets the team nowhere. Loses possession often.    
**Kaboul:** Decent shift so far. Made both good and bad decisions.    
**Rose:** Done well to bring the team back up to speed. Unfortunate support for him on the flanks as we move into the final third.     
**Eriksen:** Making smart decisions. I think it's obvious he is being crowded out in the middle of the park. We often see him shift wide to allow him time on the ball. I'm personally concerned that he is slowing the tempo down, but others may disagree. 

-----------------------

**2nd half predictions:**

mrmunchkin62 predicts a Chadli goal at the 53 minute mark.     
medlingmike claims to have switched up kit and seating arrangement in his house. Summon us the power mike!

------------------

**GUYS HOW AM I DOING? IS THIS THING ON?!**

**2nd half:**

'45 - We're underway. What else did you expect? 

'47 - Two corners for Spurs. First by Lamela and the second to be taken by Eriksen. Chadli gets his head on it but can't direct it towards net. 

'48 - Dembele caught sniffing his shoes. Quickly switches tactics and bites the shoe. No word on whether this will lead to a match ban. Stay tuned!

'50 - Eriksen puts the ball into the box just an inch too far for Lamela. It's coming!

'52 - Gardner strikes the ball off a corner like my mother would. Given, she's a pretty darn good player. Goal kick. 

'53 - Hey /u/mrmunchkin62, we're waiting mate. Where's that Chadli goal? 

'55 - **SAVE**: Morrison slips the ball to Berahino, who is only held back from celebrating by Lloris' beautiful hands. 

'60 - **SUBSTITUTION:** Poch hears us! **Soldado** for **Chadli**. **Paulinho** for **Dembele**. 

'62 - WHL sounds particularly quiet. Maybe it's just my feed? 

'63 - Foster gets a boot to the head courtesy of Soldado. He appears to look ok after putting some KY Jelly over his forehead. Everyone appears to be taking the piss.

*Sassysquatch claims: ""Get a goal Soldado. Oh my gosh. I'd sploosh all over."" -- Thanks for that visual!*

'65 - Spurs pressing hard in the final third; they're really trying to work that ball into the box. Rose's cross floats across the whole 18 yard box. 

'68 - Morrison receives a pass from Sessignon who strikes to the bottom right corner. Lloris with a nonchalant diving save. 

'70 - **SOLDADO** almost nets his first with a cheeky tip onto net after a cross from (I think, Lamela)

'72 - **Yellow Card**: Rose but I missed why. Replay showed Paulinho tackling a man. 

'73 - **GOAL:** Morrison gets on the end of a floating corner kick. Lamela, completely loses his marker and the header in was easy. 

'75 - **SUBTITUTION:** **Lennon** on for **Capoue**. 

'78 - Eriksen with two low corner kicks that are easily defended. Berahino comes deep and is fouled attempting to clear the ball. 

'81 - Foul by Berahino at halfway. Eriksen puts in a free kick but misses Dyer who is the only one in the area. 

'82 - **Yellow Card:** Sessegnon concedes a foul on Lamela and is shown a card from the ref's pocket. Free kick by Eriksen is handled easily by Foster. 

'87 - Lennon puts in a cross that Adebayor fails to jump for. Goal kick. 

'88 - Chiriches deceived by a bounce. Or... a lot of things. 

'89 - West Brom has dropped all eleven men behind the half-way and anticipate to shut up shop, park the bus and close the levy (hue hue, levy) for the remaining time. 

'89 - **Yellow Card:** Soldado draws a yellow card for a foul on Lescott. 

'89 - **SUBSTITUTION:** Sessegnon comes off for ... uh someone. I didn't catch who. Probably doesn't matter. 

'90 - Lamela and Lennon link up but West Brom clears for a throw in. 

**Four minutes extra time**

'90 - Paulinho goes for the Rainbow from a Lennon cross, but some boy in Row Z will be going home with a ball tonight. 

'92 - Spurs free kick into the box is cleared by West Brom. A succeeding cross comes in resulting in two corners. 

'93 - **Yellow Card:** Foster for delay. 

'94 - Full-time. West Brom take 3 points from White Hart Lane.

Well, with that in mind, I thought I'd have a look at a team we'll probably be competing with for survival this season: Burnley. With five gameweeks gone, I've looked at their games, players, form, playstyle and so on, to try to get a better idea of who it is we're up against. Based on what I saw I've also tried to predict the next five gameweeks (up to Nov 1), to see what kind of results we need to be getting in order to remain above them. 

If you guys enjoy this or find it useful, I'll be happy to write some more profiles on some other teams who'll likely be towards the foot of the table come May. 

**Burnley**

1.	L 1-3 Chelsea (H)

2.	L 0-1 Swansea (A)

3.	D 0-0 Man Utd (H) 

4.	D 0-0 Crystal Palace (A)

5.	D 0-0 Sunderland (H)

6.	West Brom (A)

7.	Leicester (A)

8.	West Ham (H)

9.	Everton (H)

10.	Arsenal (A)

Points: 3

Goals scored: 1 

Goals conceded: 4

Preferred formation: 4-4-2 (sometimes 4-4-1-1)

As of writing, Burnley haven’t scored a goal in more than seven hours of football. For a team that in the Championship depended on their goalscoring (72 goals, 3rd most), this has to be a concern. Their two prolific strikers from that season – Ings and Vokes – are both currently injured, Vokes having missed all season with a serious knee injury and Ings picking up a hamstring against Crystal Palace. Summer-signing Lukas Jutkiewicz is without a goal despite starting every game, but has nevertheless played well and is highly rated amongst the Burnley fans. Scott Arfield, the right-winger, in spite of a poor game against Sunderland, is a real handful, and has been Burnley’s best player so far. 

Burnley’s defence, however, is looking strong, having put up three clean sheets in a row. Their backline – Trippier, Duff, Shackell, Mee – have played consistently together since 2012. As a result the back four, despite having no ‘stars’ or household names, seem congruent, calm and confident. They aren’t what you’d call modern defenders, with adventurous wingers and ‘playing centrebacks’, but they’re quite happy to play deep all game, go narrow when the opposition attacks, and head away crosses all day long. This has worked a treat against teams who opt to play with a lot of long balls (the home draw to United being the most notable), but has been less efficient against teams who like to keep the ball on the ground and play with pace (Swansea and Chelsea).  

In spite of their inauspicious scoring habits and lack of points, Dyche urges calm. With two key strikers missing but the defence nevertheless functioning, the general mood around Burnley is that if they can remain resilient defensively, the points will come once they get some attacking prowess back.

Even though Burnley are pretty much universally considered relegation favourites, they have made a habit of exceeding expectations. Last season their bright start surprised many, and they were widely expected to be unable to keep up the pace due to the narrowness of their squad. But instead, they just kept getting stronger and stronger, and ended up earning automatic promotion comfortably. For that reason I would encourage everyone not to write them off, as they may yet become a team that punches above their weight. 

However, they are currently at a crucial stage of their season. If they start picking up points now, then the awkward start to the season will hardly have mattered; but if they don’t, they will soon find themselves in deep water. Since Everton and Arsenal are tough games to get points from, it’s the next couple of games which will prove most important. West Brom would be their best chance to pick up points, as Leicester and West Ham have both looked very strong. 

All in all, based on what I’ve seen of Burnley, I think it’s probable that they’ll finish their 10th gameweek with 5-8 points.

**23'** Eto'o tries a through ball, straight to Speroni quite a few yards in front of Atsu

**29'** Atsu a nice feed to Osman inside the box, but it's almost straight at Speroni.

**29'** **Penalty!** Crystal Palace. Howard takes down McCarthur in the box

**30'** **GOAL!** Jedinak from the penalty spot, sends Howard the wrong way and puts it top corner

**90+6** Baines puts it in but Dann smashes it out.

**90+7** Full time, 3-2 for Palace.

Capoue, Dembele, Chadli and Adebayor bad them look bad today. Eriksen and Lamela get the ball, with all the players in front of them, no one is making runs, so they have two choices; either run at the defence and get dispossessed 9/10 times because they aren't Bale, or stand still and pass sideways. I think the days of Bale and Modric have made us put too much responsibility on one or two players to produce everything, but football is a team game, you have to both attack and defend as a team, and we just are not doing that. Lamela and Eriksen were the only people who created anything today apart from hopeful crosses from others. Capoue, Dembele, and especially Adebayor killed us today. Capoue and Dembele or whoever is playing CM need to have a much more involved role in creating goals. Although it isn't easy to see, a lack of creativity from our CM has been the root of our problems since Modric left. We simply have not had a creative CM since then, Sandro, Capoue, Dembele, Bentaleb, Paulinho, Parker. Just not creative enough, and until one of them learns to contribute more or Stambolli tears shit up, we are not going to break down teams.

Speculation, but I predict our 'strong' CB's played in the EL this Thursday to give them a larger break before the important Arsenal match. I would predict;   Naughton  Chiriches  Kaboul  Davies, to play against Forest, and Dier  Fazio  Vert  Rose;   to play against Arsenal. Perhaps the transition will only be one player, but after todays performance I would imagine Chiriches will not star against Arsenal.

2. I think at this point Poch will consider starting Soldado against Arsenal. Adebayor has been so flat up front recently, so expect Kane/Ade this Wednesday. with Soldado playing Saturday.

3. At this point there is practically no argument left to be made by the anti Danny Rose fans. Rose was not only our strongest defender today, but the basis of many of our offensive plays. Sure his crosses weren't fantastic, but I guarantee that his motiviated performances are much more desirable than anything Davies can produce, especially after his dire performance last Thursday. Anybody calling for a Davies PL start seriously needs to re-evaluate their continued involvement within football.

4. We will need offensive reinforcement come January. I hope our fans are now seeing the folly of ridding the squad of versatile players such as Holtby and Sigurdsson. Chadli is probably our strongest offensive player right now, Lennon, Paulinho and Lamela have been inconsistent, Townsend has been awful. I am not sure how we would solve this issue, perhaps a formation reshuffle.

When the tardis has been moved to the Tower of London or the museum after the whole Clara can click the doors thing ( just one thing I thought only the doctor could do) but when Clara leaves the tardis, she leaves the door open.

Today, I am especially mad at the reason we lost. I think that today we had a distinct lack of identity and that our philosophical playstyle seemingly upped off and left over those 90 minutes. Its like we have a massive wheel that we spin and whatever sector it lands on, we emulate the style of play within that sector and today we landed on the latter stages of our time under AVB. The absence of pressure by the players was quite alarming in all honesty. Lamela again was the only one trying to do things and you cant win games by yourself for tottenham unless youre called gareth bale. It disappoints me to a large extent that this was the case today because i felt that, in pochettino, we had a guaranteed play style and set way of playing our stuff but it just wasnt there today. Whether its poch changing it up or the players not listening, it was definitely why we lost today I'd say.

Let's get it out of the Bag, Lampard scores and ties the game. Are we mad over at /r/chelseafc? no. As you could tell we were cheering his name and clapping and when he scored there was some sort of pain yet happiness to see Lampard score. We wished it wasn't against us but as we saw Eto'o scored against us as he was our former player as well so that eased us into this.

Mangala and Milner holy hell what a game they had those two single handedly made you guys look like you weren't down a man at all.

But I was happy with the result I would have been happier if we won but play this game away at the Etihad against City who many believe us two are the only real title contenders and come away with a point  is still a great achievement for us.

I'm looking to move to the UK and have been looking at property listing and room shares online. I've noticed that in almost all of the room listings, it says no pets, but some of the no pets ads say that there are currently pets living in the flat.  Do lots of properties ban pets and are they legally allowed to?  Am I seeing no pets ads because most people just click it by default in order to have a reason to say no to irresponsible pet owners, but if they feel comfortable with a renter and the renter's pet they will allow them?

It might seem innocuous enough until one considers that toll-roads are the only way to provide a private company with the income they are looking for, all of course underwritten by the taxpayer, if the share holders don't get their sufficient dividend.

When has the sell off of a public utility ever provided a better value alternative to it's customers in the UK?

I'm an American and my family and I were looking to stay in a medium-sized town along the main Belfast-Dublin rail corridor for a month.

We've looked at Newry and Dundalk, which city offers more?

We have two small children and we like pubs, music, festivals and parks with places to run, stroll and play with the kids. A nice public library or a children's museum would be a bonus.

EDIT: Thanks for your help! We are most likely staying next summer. 

EDIT 2: Wow, everyone - thanks for the very detailed responses. My wife and I stayed in Dublin and Belfast back in 2009 and had great times in both. Belfast seems like the better bet of the two and we never really explored the north the way we did the south. 

Another reason we were looking at Newry or Dundalk is because we were thinking of making the trip out the island a regular, (possibly annual) thing. Maybe just Air BnB, doing a house swap or even renting the same place along with some other Americans who love going here like us. We thought we'd get much better deals in the smaller towns, but still have easy access to Belfast and Dublin. But I guess the train goes regularly enough to Dublin and isn't that much shorter of a ride from Dundalk or Newry compared to Belfast.

I watched the new doctor who series a while ago (didn't get to the 11th doctor) and recently started to watch the series a new since I have netflix now (Finally available in Belgium!) and wanted to see the other doctors. Anyway, I'm doing a bit digging around to get myself as much up to speed with the old stuff as possible that I would need to enjoy the new series and found [this post on here](http://www.reddit.com/r/doctorwho/comments/ancgw/where_should_the_uninitiated_start/c0ihw71). Now I definitely want to know as much as possible about the Time War and it would seem that the 8th doctor is rather recent and somehow involved according to [this site](http://www.doctorwho.tv/50-years/doctors/) and so it the war doctor. I suppose that these come in the new series but there appears to be a movie of the 8th doctor as well (called the movie or Enemy Within according to wikipedia). Where should I fit the movie in the above mentioned plan?

**TL;DR**: Found [this guide](http://www.reddit.com/r/doctorwho/comments/ancgw/where_should_the_uninitiated_start/c0ihw71) on how to watch the new and old Doctor Who but I don't know when to watch the movie of the 8th doctor (called the movie or Enemy Within according to wikipedia). Are there any other things I should watch to get more info on the Time war? **No spoilers please**

We looked tired and unfit in the first games. Even though the fitness level has improved eventually, the points dropped at Leicester and against Arsenal have damaged our confidence. 


The lack of planning is also worrying. Mirallas and McGeady both could've been withdrawn from the game earlier against Wolfsburg when the game was 3-0. Instead Kev was replaced by Ossie at the 89th minute and McGeady finished the game absolutely knackered. 


Same thing could be said about McCarthy and Barry. Gibson and Besic could've had more minutes when the game was pretty much done at the 50th minute. There isn't any other way to get the players familiarize with others and improve other than letting them play. So far we haven't seen that happening much and we have yet to see Browning, Garbutt, Chris Long play at all, all of whom have impressed in the preseason.


Roberto has done relatively well in the transfer market apart from the Wigan quartet barring McCarthy. Kone has done nothing to justify his 6M price tag. He was out for a while with injury but even before he was injured he was missing empty netters from 6 yards. Alcaraz is utter shite, taking up 20k per week doing shit all. Robles is also incapable of playing without being nervous and sloppy, definitely not worth 3M. So basically we spent almost 10M on 3 players who are not Premier League calibre. Alcaraz and Kone are also over 28 when we bought them. They offer no resale value and these transfers make me think that basically we're doing a Bebe, masking payments to Wigan for Martinez by paying premium price for shitty players. That or Roberto overevaluates his old players A LOT. That coupled with the rumours that we're in for Cleverly give me real causes for concern. 


Training-wise, our attack is more dynamic, players are finding their grooves. Coleman is coming into his own and Lukaku has shown to be better with his link up play after only one season with us. These are direct results from training. However the defense had slowly deteriorated. Our set piece defending is in shambles. We have real trouble holding on to leads and it's very worrying. 


I'm very happy that Roberto has gotten us to play some good football. We do very well usually against teams that wanna play, but against teams that set out to defend the whole game, we suffer. Games against Crystal Palace, last year against Cardiff and West Brom all showed us lacking a cutting edge and ruthlessness to beat the opposition no matter what. Roberto needs to figure out a Plan B when Plan A doesn't work. So far, we have yet to see him replicate his magic with substitutions this season. 

Goodison Park used to be a tough place to visit and we need to make sure it goes back to that way ASAP. Conceding 13 goals in 5 games is unacceptable and if it continues, we can say goodbye to top half finish, let alone European spots.

I'm new here.  (Really, just joined.)  I've been a Doctor Who fan for a number of years though.  Last night I was thinking about the new episode, and that fact that I'm not a fan of Steven Moffat.  I came up with a song I titled ""Moffat Go.""  It's sung to the tune of ""Let It Go"" from Frozen.  

“Moffat Go”

My show glows bright on the screen tonight
Not a Donna to be seen.
At lot of inconsistencies,
But it’s not the worst it’s been.

The fans are howling like a swirling storm outside.
Couldn’t keep it in, although we didn’t try.

Don’t let him in, don’t let him see
Be the good fans we always have to be.
Love the show, don’t let him know
Well he should know!

Moffat go, Moffat go!
Can’t hold it back anymore.
Moffat go, Moffat go!
Turn away go out the door!

I don’t care
What he’s going to say.
Let the storm rage on, ‘
Him leaving wouldn’t bother me anyway!

It’s funny how some plot lines
Don’t make much sense at all.
And the fear of all the fans
Has our backs against the wall.
It’s time to see what others can do
To test their limits and break through.
No more Moffat plot lines for me, I’m free!

Moffat go, Moffat go!
We are yelling to the wind and sky.
Moffat go, Moffat go!
That is our rallying cry.

Here we’ll stand,
And here we’ll stay.
Let the storm rage on!

His power flurries through the scripts, he won’t back down.
My soul flutters with hope each week but gets let down.
And one thought crystallizes like an icy blast
He should never come back here,
The past is in the past!

Moffat go, Moffat go!
The fans will rise like the break of dawn.
Moffat go, Moffat go!
Your perfect fans are gone.
Here we stand,
In the light of day.
Let the storm rage on,
His leaving wouldn’t bother us anyway!",false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,null,null,self,"""Let It Go"" Doctor Who Style",0,http://www.reddit.com/r/doctorwho/comments/2h2ndn/let_it_go_doctor_who_style/

1. Would I even be accepted for a 12 month+ 0% CC considering I'm a student, who has been dipping in and out of his overdraft for the past few months.
2. What does it mean by meeting minimum monthly repayments, could any give me an example?

I'd more than comfortably pay it off in 10 months, as I'm currently on a working placement year with a £16,500 salary. Would they take that into consideration?

It was pretty blatant last night that we weren't going to play through the middle of them but we didn't seem to know what else to do.

The key problems for me are: Lamela, possibly just cause he wants to be a playmaker but maybe partially because he is leftfooted, is always coming inside and seems to be playing on top of Eriksen the whole game. From there he is either trying to beat people or pass through tiny gaps with varying success but it's NOT something we'd want to rely on throughout a season. 
The other problem is Ade who is reluctant to play off the shoulder of the CB and compete for the balls. He is compounding the problem and dropping deeper, meaning we often have Ade, Eriksen and Lamela all in a congested little area. He seems keener to lay the ball off to the midfield than get at the goal. 

Eriksen is getting criticised for his play, but I think he's a player who thrives on space and needs options off the ball - neither of which he's getting at the moment. 

I do wonder if playing a formation more like [THIS](http://lineupbuilder.com/2014/custom/?sk=4ny00) , encouraging our wingers to get the ball in the box and the strikers to compete and cause troubles for the CBs. I'm not convinced Lamela wouldn't still steal Eriksens space there but I think it'd improve it.

Someone else made a post recently that we overplay and are too reluctant to get off a shot. This is probably true, but as others pointed out we did take a lot of shots under AVB and they were wild and didn't offer anything. I think with Eriksen and Dembele where they are, they are our 2 most consistent long range shooters (debatable) and they might do a better job shooting than Paulinho and Townsend did last season. Note in the formation I suggested that in the mid 4 they are L-R-L-R so you have natural crossers on the flank and natural shooting positions infield - though Dembele and Eriksen seem unlikely to shoot nearly as much as Townsend/Pauli.

While our defense has been terrible the past couple games, I think that's largely because our back 4 right now are basically the backups.  My feeling is that once we start the middle part of the season when our players settle in and get healthy, we'll see a solid back 4 of Davies/Vert/Fazio/Walker.  

Our big problem right now is our attack.  We just don't have any goal scorers.  Going into this season, I was hoping Ade would be able to fill the role of the lone striker, which he did at times last season, but his time is over.  At this point, he shouldn't be starting.  I think he's trying his best, but he's a really old 30 right now.   His skills have deteriorated significantly from even 2 seasons ago.  He really should only used as a sub.  The other strikers aren't that much better really.  Soldado isn't a lone striker and Kane still has a ways to go.

So, at least until Winter, when maybe we can buy someone to help us (I'm hoping Benteke), the only solution I can think of is to go to a 4-3-3 in a poor man's replica of what Ancelotti's Madrid do.  Eriksen, who hasn't really developed into the proper #10 I hoped he would, would go to a position where he's had the most amount of success.  Lamela would fill the other side.  The key here is that in this formation, neither player would really worry about defense and concentrate more on attack.  Soldado would play forward. He offers speed and I'm hoping that friendship he has with Lamela pays off.  Also, his past success in Spain was in situations where had help up front.  This might be the best way to get the most out of him.  

Bentalib/Chadli, Capoue/Stam, Dembele/Stam would play the midfield.  Against better teams, the three CM's would have to take up the defensive duties that Lamela and Eriksen give up.  Against weaker teams, perhaps Chadli can start and offer a bit more attack.",false,coys,t5_2ryq7,null,null,self,Maybe 4-3-3 would solve our problems??,0,http://www.reddit.com/r/coys/comments/2h3dqs/maybe_433_would_solve_our_problems/

1. His decision making from out wide is very poor, with all the features of a kid with a Robben poster on his wall. His once-a-season cross is, consequently, relatively ineffective because he never gives himself ample opportunities to refine them in match conditions.

2. Kid likes to shoot. A lot. Because of his maddening addiction for cutting inside, he constantly approaches the goal from an angle which hampers his ability to get the shot on target. Approaching the goal head-on would make this easier for him. 

3. He's got serious pace, which earned him his England callup. More than Adebayor, Soldado or even Kane. With less pressure to provide link-up play he can beat high lines at will. 

4. We have plenty of wingers but are one injury away from a striker crisis if we make a decent run in Europa.

5. If he doesn't play wing he frees up a spot for Lennon!

A few months ago I realised building a credit score is bloody important and I should get on it, so got on the voter roll and got an Initial Barclaycard.

I have a good salary^1 and spent about £1.5k/m (always paid in full) during the four months I had the card. I had a look at my credit file and it's as empty as you'd expect; there's certainly nothing bad on it.

I was hoping I could get a better card already; and since I have no debt and want no credit, the only thing I care about building credit score (and rewards).

I just heard from Barclaycard I'm not (yet?) eligible for any of their other products, and moneysavingexperts' eligibility estimator gives me a pretty bleak outlook for applying to any of the cards I want (and a I certainly don't want to add decline to injury, as the saying goes...).

As mentioned in my previous post, I still think/hope I'm a good credit candidate and credit companies aren't yet willing to recognize that solely on grounds of my short time here - then again, I don't know.

I've build decent savings during my brief time here (£15k and going strong), and probably will move over a nice lump sum from abroad soon (£100k+). I know I'm lucky to be in good shape, but it's kinda frustrating I can't bring my full financial potential into play insofar as my credit score is concerned.

Any advice? Anything I can do to make things go quicker?

It is only very minor damage - a few scuffs to the bumper - but it'll still cost a bit to fix as the whole panel will need to be resprayed. If he'd stopped and apologised I probably wouldn't bother, but he didn't, so I will. Another question: if I did pursue this, a) would my insurer have to find out and b) how is this likely to affect my insurance premium, even if I don't intend to involve my insurer at all?

EDIT: I guess a better question might be, am I *obligated* to tell my insurer about a minor accident even if I managed to sort it out with the other party cash-in-hand, as it were? Would they find out (e.g. through police records) even if I didn't tell them myself?

UPDATE: So I phoned 101 once I was home from work as suggested. I described the scenario, gave the reg of the other car, etc. I was given a reference number and asked to go to the local police station to provide my own license, insurance, etc. At the station, I had to repeat all of the information I had already given, not sure why - seems that the call was a little redundant. I also gave a written statement. They took my license, insurance, and MOT information. She also took a look at the photos on my phone, copied down the witness' phone number, and confirmed that an offence had indeed taken place (failing to stop at an accident). Took about another 20 minutes.

Apparently the form will be sent off somewhere else for processing. If they can track down the other guy from the information provided, he'll be sent a letter asking for his version of events. They'll also verify his insurance, MOT, license etc. for the criminal aspect and he'll be in trouble if any of that doesn't check out. He has 28 days to respond to the letter once sent - I'm not sure what happens if he ignores it. It's up to me whether I want to pursue the civil aspect of getting him to pay for the damages if he's found - my insurer needn't be involved and won't find out about any of this unless I do, according to the lady at the station.

However, I also think that the stories we have been given so far have been hit and miss.

Deep breath was an awesome introduction the new Doctor and it also had an amazing story with a few nods to Matt Smith which was great.

Into the Dalek did not really grab my attention to much. The story felt really bland and it had so much potential to be great. Maybe I think this because they jumped straight to the Doctor being a dark person right off the bat. Maybe it would have been better if they slowly built it up through the series and saving this for one of the episodes before the series finale.

Robots of sherwood was great. It felt like an adventure and that is what the whole show is about. 

Listen was by far in my opinion the greatest episode in this series so far. I felt hooked immediately and the tension that built up through the episode was amazing. I like how it could have been a monster or it could have been nothing at all. Notice how the Doctor kept providing an explanation for all the things that happened. He would say it could be a monster on the bed or it could be one of Ruperts friends playing a joke on him.  Also, when they were at the end of the universe he always provided an explanation whenever they heard a strange sound coming from out side. For example, when Cara asked him what it could be, he said""potentially the hull cooling or...company"". It was left up the the viewer to decide if it was real or not and that is what makes great writing. 

Time heist again was a miss for me. I already guessed the ending and it was really dull. I did however like the bank teller. that was a pretty cool alien.

Keep in mind that these are all my opinions.

I still think Capaldi is amazing but I don't think he is being given to many amazing stories so far. Maybe it just the writers trying to see what works for the new era and hopefully it will finds it path soon. I am still a fan and will always be though.

Now we do of course have free speech, but not if it is likely to a cause a breach of the peace / incitement to racial hatred / incitement to terrorism / glorifying terrorism etc. I am pretty sure Anjem has breached those laws several times now.

1. Is it a case of he is a super smart lawyer who outsmarts the establishment every time?

2. Is he really not doing anything wrong? 

3. He is working with the secret services or the secret services have him as an unknown honeypot to attract other extremists and bring them into view. 

I don't believe it's point one (he seems to open his mouth without much thought). 

I would be very surprised if its point two, as I am pretty sure if I said something similar on twitter the police would be at my door. 

The third point is conspiracy theory of course, but could be a factor.

That's pretty cool, because if everything works out with that I will be an Uncle^^3 ! She phoned up yesterday/this morning to deliver the happy news at around 1am. Naturally, this means 1am was pretty much the last time I saw sleep and have been awake since then drinking coffee and being quite excited whilst at the same time pondering what will happen from now on.  
  
  Now, my sister is not one for logic or reason, and especially not so whilst anxious and in pain and hormonal as fuck, so, allow me to clear up why I am pondering what's going on; her waters broke hours ago, but she's still not having contractions, so she's sitting in a hospital going 'gah' because nothing is happening. Baby is also a few weeks early, and this is where the confusion starts up.  
  
  Not sure if anyone recalls, but a few months ago I was in Germany visiting my mother with my missus. We were told much to our confusion that Mother was Plan A where it came to minding my sister's existing child while my sister was to give birth. Logically, a person in another country is in a bad place to be Plan A in terms of an emergency, if you follow, as they happen to be in a different country. All objections brushed aside, my sister wants her mother there, so what do? 
  
  My mother, being the obliging sort, booked a month off work in order to be there when it happens a week in advance of when due, and then having a further 3 weeks after due date to play with in order to offer support etc. Quite the charity worker, and to be honest, I don't agree with that at all, because in all I think my sister's husband should really be the one not going to work (and no, they're not poor by any stretch) and helping out instead of my mother having to fly from Germany to London, and then having to get a train/bus/cab/lift from us down to the coast.  
  
  My mother's flight was booked for next week, she was supposed to arrive Thursday. Baby is early. So, naturally, it seems, the world stops and at 1am through to now I have the same tired argument over logic and logistics with my mother who is being asked to book a flight immediately, whilst also being asked (kindly, I'll add) for assistance by sister's husband, in case they have any worries etc whether we can look after child number 1. That's not a problem, we don't mind being on stand-by, and work will understand.   
  
  My problem with this is - we are about an hour and a half away. They have friends and some family on his side much closer than us, and a lot of them do shift work etc not to mention a support network of existing mums from playgroups to nurseries etc who could also be trusted to be there for a few hours in order to look after child number 1. 
  
  Logically, these are the people to approach in the first instance, followed by us, followed finally by my/our mum in order to fly in and help *after* the birth has occurred.  It's all arse-about-face, and we *still* have no idea if mum is supposed to book a flight, if we're supposed to be waiting for her to pick her up and drive her down, if we're supposed to be hitting the road tonight ourselves (this will leave us with a problem re: cat) or whether we're supposed to let them get on with it, pop it out and then congratulate and offer help after.   
  
  With my sister being in the hospital and waiting and her husband not really keeping us informed, we're all a bit stuck.   
  
  Basically, I have no idea what I'm doing, and no one does either.  
 
  How's you Monday going?  
  
  **Update edit** Looks like they will be inducing some time between now and Wednesday, so mother has been asked to book flight.

Is there an explanation for this? Any way around it? 

I decided to try with my PS3 for da first time today picks up 3 seperate BTFon hotspots and the 60% signal times out every time whereas i just decided i pick the 32% signal its working but i can't imagine it will survive this onslaught of updates playstation have thrown at me without dropping.

Again, is there a work around? Where is the logic in the lesser signal being stronger....Fuck BT and god knows why anyone would pay £7 a day to use this service, ouch!

He didn't speak much English at all. I did manage to ask where the tobacco came from (thinking that maybe it was imported). turns out it's produced on the island itself. 

I didn't get much time, and only had a few euros left in my pocket, but fortunately the cigars he was selling were going for just 2.50Euro, so i had enough to buy just one. 

Whilst on the boat I bought a couple of duty free singles, I had picked up a montecristo too, but it turned out to be mouldy, as did the other two they had left in the humidor so that promptly got returned - shame.

Anyway, what's done is done. Let's move on and look at our next two games; Nottingham Forest and that lot from south of the river.   
  
What do we think the line ups will be? And how many will we win each game by?  
  
Personally I like the idea of this....  
  
Wednesday:   
----------------Vorm-----------------    
Naughton---Fazio---Chiriches---Davies    
--------Dembele----Bentaleb----------    
Townsend------Kane------------Chadli    
--------------Soldado----------------  
  
Saturday:  
------------Lloris-----------------   
Dier---Kaboul---Vertonghen---Rose     
-----Capoue----Stambouli---------    
Lennon----Lamela----------Eriksen  
---------Adebayor----------------  
  
I think Wednesdays squad will have to be based upon who we want to play on the Saturday.  Capoue's had a good season so far, and Stambouli looks very lively and willing to put in a lot of tackles which personally I think we'll need to disrupt Arsenal's flow and keep breaking them up, much the same way the Sandro of old :'(.   
  
I would give Lennon a go, for a few reasons. 1, I think against West Brom we seriously lacked a bit of pace and speed, and even if Azza offers nothing else, he brings that. 2, I know this is said about Lennon a lot (as a negative and a positive) but he does offer half decent defensive cover.  
  
Anyways, anyone got any better ideas? Anything that isn't moping about yesterday.  
  
Just remember, WE'RE GOING TO WIN THE LEAGUE

**Swansea 0 - 1 Southampton**

What a fantastic result! I don't think many of us would've expected to come away with three points from that fixture! It wasn't pretty but three points is three points. We're second in the league! Go on, pinch yourself.

Bloody hell, what a weekend that was! Some absolute bonkers results. It's really too early to tell who are main competitors for league position are this season but we can still work off of current form and results last year to get a reasonable idea. 

[QPR 2-2 Stoke:](http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/29187276) It's much more likely that we'll be fighting for position with Stoke rather than QPR so it's good they didn't get all three points against what is quite a poor QPR. Hopefully this isn't a sign that Redknapp is improving with the squad, I've got my heart set on a 4-0 next Saturday! 

[Aston Villa 0-3 Arsenal:](http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/29187273) A good result for us I'd say. We have to accept that we're not going to for a Premier League victory this year so it's in our interests that three or four of the top teams consistently win against the mid-top table clubs. 

[Burnley 0-0 Sunderland:](http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/29187273) I'd like to think that neither team will be a problem for us this season although Sunderland was a bit of a bogey team last year. Still, we advanced two points on both of them just in case!

[Newcastle 2-2 Hull City:](http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/29187314) When Hull went two nil up it looked like it was all done and dusted but quite a decent comeback to rescue a much needed point for Pardrew. A draw is a pretty great result I think as Hull are looking quite threatening this season. 

[West Ham 3-1 Liverpool:](http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/29187275) Whether it was in our interests or not that that West Ham took three points, I don't care one bit! Liverpool lost, Lovren and Lallana looked miserable. Lovely stuff. Also makes our win away to Upton Park look extremely good!

[Leicester 5-3 Man Utd:](http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/29196081) Words cannot describe how amazing this match was. Amazing. But from a serious Southampton perspective, I think we may actually be able to finish ahead of Man Utd this season. I might be getting ahead of myself here as we haven't had the hardest of opening fixtures but bloody hell, neither have they! We were only a small handful of points from finishing ahead of them last season so it's not beyond the realms of possibility that we can do it this year. 

[Tottenham 0-1 West Brom:](http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/29196073) As if the day couldn't get any better. Poor old Poch, the grass wasn't greener on the other side apparently. 

[Everton 2-3 Crystal Palace:](http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/29196080) It really was a barmy weekend wasn't it?! Spurs and Everton both finished in Europa League places last year which is where I'd love Southampton to finish this season so for both of them to lose at home to bottom table teams is amazing. 

[Man City 1-1 Chelsea:](http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/29196082) To be honest this match won't affect our season in the slightest I expect. But it does mean we've advanced a couple of points on both teams which is no bad thing. And it's mathematically possible to top the table next week!

[The headline here is Boruc's move to the local Championship side AFC Bournemouth.](http://www.saintsfc.co.uk/news/article/20140919-announcement-artur-boruc-afc-bournemouth-loan-1928849.aspx) I'm very happy with this to be honest despite the fact it came from nowhere. It's only a move until January though which might indicate that he'll be moving on in the next transfer window. Either way, it's better that he's playing for a local side in a top division on a weekly basis instead of sulking on the bench for us! He made his debut for the Cherries in their away game to Watford on Saturday. It finished 1-1, I managed to catch the game as it was a lunchtime kick off and he looked very good still. A real coup for Bournemouth to pick him up!

[Jos Hooiveld played the full 90 minutes as Norwich drew 2-2 at home to Birmingham.](http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/29186835) 

[Jordan Turnbull played two full matches for Swindon Town this week including a fantastic 5-2 win at home to Sheffield United. Jack Stephens has played in neither game due to an illness.](http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/teams/swindon-town) 

[Gastón Ramírez was an unused substitution for Hull City vs Newcastle.](http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/29187314)

[Dani Osvaldo played the full game as Inter Milan drew 1-1 away to Palermo. He was close to scoring a late winner but Palermo goalkeeper Stefano Sorrentino denied his headed effort.](http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/29277861)

[Jake Sinclair had a strong showing for Scottish Championship side Hibernian as they lost 1-0 away to Queen of the South. Sinclair played the first hour and caused many problems for Queen's defense as they struggled to deal with his technical ability. He came close to scoring an equaliser but his effort was calmly collected.](http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/29187465)

Southampton FC's Under-18's squad travelled to Upton Park to face West Ham on Saturday afternoon. It looked like it was going to be a strong showing following the first team's strong showing a week earlier, Kyle Clinton scored twice from headers to put the Saints up 2-0 inside 25 minutes. But a fine solo effort and an equaliser just before half-time made it 2-2. With just five minutes remaining, the Hammers completed the comeback and clinched the three points. Sadly, this leaves the U-18's at the bottom of the league with just one point from five fixtures. [Match Report](http://www.saintsfc.co.uk/news/article/20140920-u18-report-west-ham-united-3-2-southampton-1930100.aspx). [Match Highlights.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nxzd9iXoTWI&amp;list=UUxvXjfiIHQ2O6saVx_ZFqnw) 

The Under-21's squad play this evening away to Everton. They are currently in seventh place with four points from three games.

The Guardian have recently started a new series looking at fantastic goals in great detail. The first one was about Le Tissier's goal vs Newcastle in 1993. [If you haven't seen the goal before then click this link now!](http://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2014/sep/19/golden-goal-matt-le-tissier-southampton-newcastle)

There was also an excellent article on the history between us and our local rivals Portsmouth FC. Sadly it was posted on a forum filled with horrible people who all have a distinct lack of optimism. Did I mention the writer is also incredibly handsome? [Anyway, you can read that here.](http://www.reddit.com/r/SaintsFC/comments/2guqtn/the_notsoweekly_feature_el_classicoast/) 

I wouldn't normally link to the Daily Mail but for once there's a reasonable article. [I know, incredible isn't it?](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-2764344/MARTIN-SAMUEL-Southampton-shouldn-t-fooled-high-life-selling-big-danger.html)

Our next league fixture is home to QPR on Saturday afternoon. QPR are sitting third from bottom with just 4 points from the five opening fixtures. Redknapp is returning to St. Mary's so please if you can go along to chuck a pie at him or something. 

We also have a very very difficult fixture in the League Cup as we travel away to the Emirates to face Arsenal. That's happening tomorrow night, it won't be shown here in England but it will be online to stream as it's being televised in the US I think. Hopefully Koeman will show a bit more determination in having some cup runs this season as Poch was dreadful at that last season.

Here's my rationale:

- The biggest city doesn't need to be the capital, e.g. Canada and the United States. Other countries could retain consulates in London.
- Moving the capital would address claims that the government is London-centric. 
- The running costs of government would be much lower in terms of salary, property,  etc. The logistics of moving MPs around and staging debates would also be more efficient in a purpose-built parliament complex.
- Wherever the capital was relocated to would *hugely* benefit from the influx of jobs and investment. 
- Conversely, London could actually benefit - a huge number of skilled workers would become available, while lots of properties in prime locations would become available. 
- The sale of assets like Whitehall would raise a staggering amount of cash.
- London would remain the capital of England and the seat of the monarch, giving it a continued civic role.

As to where the new capital would be, somewhere a bit more geographically central with good transport links would make sense to me.

It's a bit fanciful, but I genuinely think it could be a win-win situation. What do people think? ",false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,null,null,self,Should the UK capital be relocated?,2,http://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/2h48gm/should_the_uk_capital_be_relocated/

We've been coasting on this decision for the last year, but and I am wondering if we should behave as if we're staying, and buy a place now with 120k down, instead of waiting 4-5 years and putting down 200k. The mortgage wouldn't significantly impact our savings rate.

My question is: if we decide to cut and run in 4-5 years time then are we likely to turn a profit on a property?

You may remember that about a month ago I made a [post](http://www.reddit.com/r/brum/comments/2dl2ua/right_you_horrible_lot/) trying to gauge interest in the members of /brum in having a more active social calendar.

Finally I have got around to creating /r/brumsoc which we can use to suggest and sign up to attend a range of social events on a week by week basis.

I'd be really greatful if you could jump over and make some suggestions for events that we can vote on (in the thread for the relevant week) and hopefully we can fill your social calendar!

I think that with Suarez leaving we were never going to score as many goals and needed to shore up defence, a popular opinion and one that is currently ringing true.  So where can we fit Gerrard in when he plays if not the base of midfield? Just ahead of the base? Behind one or two strikers? 

One more thing, everyone says Gerrard plays as a defensive midfielder and I don't see this.  He may operate in the same area of the field but Rodgers does not see his role as a defensive/destructive midfielder, he is playing a deep playmaker role and defensive duties are not handed to him solely but of the whole midfield and team.  I think it is unfair to expect him to be making tackles left, right and centre whilst also expecting him to track every runner and starting attacks.  

I do think Gerrard has had a bad start to the season and we all know he can play much better.

It'll also be great to create little competitions as well (ie climb X metres in a week(, but I guess I'll just see how many people join up and that will dictate my level of involvement.

My current set-up is as follows:

* I have a HSBC Current Account that has ~£15k sitting in it.
* I have an old dormant Barclays personal account.
* I have an old student loan that is steadily being paid off with minimal payments - I feel I should pay this off sooner rather than let it continue to incur interest and know I've been lazy with it.
* I had a Barclaycard Credit Card until recently which I closed and have since been told I shouldn't have but hey ho.  
* I have very minimal outgoings (phone bill, few other bits and bobs) and am able to easily save ~£1k every month. 

What I'm looking to get is an ISA or Savings Account (or a combination of both) as well as a Credit Card that gives me cash-back or rewards. I do a lot (90%) of online shopping and in the coming months hope to start a new job in central London - when that happens I'm considering getting a motorcycle for the daily commute ~£6-8k + petrol (I can't be dealing with the daily tube journeys) but will still use the tube every now and again. 

Whatever account I eventually get I don't think I'll need access to it but I'm not 100% sure. I'd like to be able to manage the account(s) and card(s) online and if there are no annual charges that would be a huge bonus.

Seriously, this has been a good start for us. Especially if you compare it to how the other top clubs are doing.

Follow us [https://twitter.com/ISJerseyBingo](@ISJerseyBingo) for updates and feel free to tweet pictures of yourself to join in the fun!

We will be approaching people and asking for permission to take photos and will be uploading all pictures to the twitter account, keeping you all updated throughout the day. We'll also be picking up any college, fantasy and other jerseys too.

If you want us to take a picture of you on the day, feel free to tweet to us and we'll do our best to find you.

We'll be in a group of 5 - Us 2 (Pats Brady home, 9ers Kaepernick home), my other half, my brother (possibly Redskins home) and his friend. Feel free to approach us too, if you do see us!

I really want to see Remy start to see how it goes. We've looked a little toothless without Costa. Drogba was a little disappointing when he started (Schalke still hurts). I think Drogba's best role is to come on as a sub. Ofc, I may be wrong about him and Mou knows better. I don't think Mou is one to keep playing someone for sentimental reasons. Didn't Eto'o have a similar slow start last season? He wound up being the best of our strikers last season. So perhaps Didier will grow into his role. He did say he was like a ""diesel engine"".

Were we dreadful? Yes. Have I lost hope? No.
I've been reading a lot about fellow fans going on [r/soccer](http://reddit.com/r/soccer) saying dumb shit in order to get karma, and that's fine. Personally, it took me two minutes to figure out that r/soccer was a cesspool of gooner fans and anti-spurs trolls, so I refrained from posting there and will only lurk occasionally. Going there just irritates me more than anything so I figured it was better in moderation. That being said, I think we need to not be so blindly optimistic OR pessimistic. We need to start being realistic. 

I'll admit that I'm a relatively new fan who only started following around 2006, and watching Spurs was a bit of a roller coaster ride (which is why I love watching them) but I always felt that we were on a steady ascendancy. Some will argue we are still on the ascendance, others will say that we've regressed. We can all agree, however, that football is cyclical, with many ups and downs along the way. I think a lot of the newer fans are trying to deal with this stagnation after watching us steadily progress for years (and after seeing Bale's breakout), but if you talk to older fans, they will say something like ""did you see where we were 20 years ago? We've come a long way.""

Right now I trust in Poch (which I find a lot of members of this sub do as well which is reassuring). I think he is still giving players a go to properly assess them before he makes his ideal starting XI and I think that's why we've had an up and down start to the season. Fazio and Verts will most likely be our prreferred CB pair, but maybe he saw something in Vlad and Kaboul during training that warranted a start. After yesterday, Poch may reassess where those players now stand in the pecking order. I think that once Walker and others return from injury, our backline will look a lot different than it does now and our defense will improve (and hopefully our offense too).

Poch, unlike AVB, had a surprisingly successful first season in the prem which proves to me that he is capable of getting the most out of players. We have a lot of similar players and I think that the exodus of certain guys during the summer transfer window shows that he recognizes that. By January, I believe that he will bring players in where he sees fit. 

I already know that this will be a better season than last year because we beat West Ham on our opening match. That was a big game for us and we got the result we needed. Recent matches have made fans start to worry but I think we can all agree that we've seen the return of attractive football this season. We need to be more patient and less reactionary, and we need to realize that we can lose to a team like West Brom just as easily as we can lose to a team like Man City. But we can also beat a team like Arsenal just like we can beat a team like West Ham. We need to be able to cope with results like yesterday's if we want to keep a manager for more than a season or two and see something great get built before our eyes.

I don't know. It just seems a little pointless. I'm 18 and by the time I finish this apprenticeship I'd be 20/21, and apprenticeship wage wouldn't be enough to move out and live independently during that time.

Would a degree benefit me more than an apprenticeship if I want to get into the IT field?

I happen to work for one of the most understaffed departments in my shop.  I am currently looking for full time work after finishing uni, so I am quite happy to take extra hours, and have been doing so even when I have been given little to no notice.  I should also add I tend to work at awkward times of the day, between 9-12pm Thursday, Friday &amp; Sunday are my usual contracted shifts.

I am quite happy to work Fridays.  I'm not usually the person who tends to go out clubbing every single weekend so I am quite happy working one of the weekend nights so I can do as I please the other night.  I have worked both Friday &amp; Saturdays before and these aren't fun, but I have done them before seeing as we are short staffed.

However, some of my other workmates aren't as compassionate, and have turned down shifts as they 'don't work' on various days as it isn't in their contract to work them.  This however technically goes against our contract which states that we should be available to work as per our availability which we stated when we started the job.  In short, you can really only turn down a shift providing you have a good excuse.  My work has also started doing 4 weekly shift rotas.

I believe all of this is fair enough.  However, I am mainly annoyed because my friend invited me out for drinks on Saturday night which never EVER happens to me. I haven't seen her in a while.  My main concern is that I won't be able to get that night off due to the fact I required last weekend off to go to a family wedding.

Like, who actually wants to work both of those nights?  Not even the managers in my shop do both nights.  I am probably going to get told to suck it up as it's just my stop-gap to better things, but I still find this annoying anyway.

Hopefully I can get it sorted tomorrow.  Thanks for reading!

TLDR; I, a lowly supermarket employee, have been put down to work Friday &amp; Saturday nights this week, thus being unable to go out for drinks with friends which I don't get to do all that often.

8 years experience in playing dota + dota 2. Numerous league /comp experience I talk + communicate Skype, mumble whatever is needed. I can play all roles but my main strength lies within playing 4,5.

My overdraft is £1500, my interest free limit is £1000. Bank has said because my overdraft balance is above £1000 interest free limit I pay interest on the entire amount. 

I have a graduate account pre-2013. 


Could any kind person read the above terms and conditions on graduate overdraft interest/fees and tell me which is correct.

My partner recently received a bill from Past Due Credit Solutions for around £100, with an ""Administration fee"" of around £30. This is 'on behalf of' npower. A friend who lived in the same house at the time is getting in touch with npower tomorrow to see if they know anything about it.

Since I was practically living with my partner during the time she is alleged to have fallen behind with her bills, I can attest that she did pay every bill on time. When there were late bills (shared house, some did not pull their weight), she organised the paying off of these late bills and fees. The bills arrived quarterly and there was never more than one request for late collection (because after the first arrived and my partner put on *the face*, everyone would pay their bills off very quickly).

I am entirely certain that she does not owe them a penny, but how do we prove this? What do we do? What steps should we take? Will this affect her credit rating despite the fact there's no validity to the claims?

When we did move in we found that the house was in disrepair and was not safe for living in, and as such we never paid any rent at any point. We found another place, but we're currently in discussion with our old landlord about getting our deposit back. When asked, he replied that we should push the keys through the letterbox of the house and we'll get the deposits later, because its the norm to return the keys before getting the deposit back.

My question is - Is this the actual norm? The landlord has been a bit useless so far, making promises of when the house will be ready which have been completely wrong, things like that. If it's the norm, an we can get our deposit back then that's fine, we'll do it, but better safe than sorry! Thanks for any help :)

There's a boy and he's in the car with his dad, eating a McDonald's. He decides to throw it out of the window. A bird then picks it up and is flying low when a women with 2 kids in the back sees the bird and swerves. She then hits a cyclist.

I haven't really thought of much past this, but I've started writing it and wrote the first paragraph. However I can't think of a way to continue it. This is what I did for the first paragraph:

""I couldn’t eat anymore. It was too much. The soft, tender, succulent chicken which had been so beckoning before, I could no longer force down my throat. My dad was driving me down the streets of London, on our way back from McDonalds. We were in our black Bentley, going at 50 mph.

I recently had my mobile phone stolen abroad, and the thieves managed to make a large number of phone calls before I was able to report it as stolen. I have been charged a ridiculous amount by EE for these calls, and when I look down the itemised bill, it seems like the thieves have been making multiple calls at the same time.

For example, the thief makes a 5 minute phone call (say at 08:30) then makes a 7 minute phone call at 08:31, then a 6 minute call at 08:33, and so on. All calls were to the same (foreign) number as well.

Is this technically possible? I thought a phone could only make one phone call at a time. It is currently being investigated by EE but I would like to know what to say to them if they tell me that all charges are to stand.

He’s not exactly the Swedish Chef from The Muppets.

&gt;Although Oliver himself was surprised – “The public, more than ever, really want to eat more veg” – his final reply belies someone with a fortune of £240 million and one million subscribers on Food Tube. “It’s fair enough,” he shrugs. “Channels have got their own thing to worry about. And you know what, if I did 130 five-minute veg videos over the course of a year [and put them on Food Tube], that’s probably what I’ll do. I was gutted,” he adds, “but I’ve done most of the hard work, and it’ll happen at some point. The book’s on top of a cupboard somewhere. Waiting.”

Me and my girlfriend are currently renting a 1 bedroom flat for £665 pm.  We are expecting our first child at the end of October.  We are planning to move in with her parents in January to try and save for a mortgage, this is a new idea as my girlfriends sister has been offered a council house recently and we could move in to her parents then, plus it's a big 4 bedroom house with much more room for us and the baby than this flat.

We agreed to a second year of letting this flat in August however we want to break the agreement early but still keep our deposit due to this new plan which has come out of the blue. If we told the letting agency and landlord in say October that we plan to leave in January so they have plenty of notice to find a new tenant, would we get our deposit or is that really just a personal call from the landlord?

To be frank, I am a little disappointed. The worst part is how much the sci-fi component has dropped off. Also, I'm not feeling a connection with many of the characters. Sorry Clara, you're smoking hot but you are right too often, the doctor is supposed to be the clever half while you help guide him through tough situations(not show him the way out).

Looking at the Robin Hood episode, I thought it was atrocious, nothing like what doctor who should be. Like I mentioned before regarding sci-fi, this was more of an unfunny comedy sketch. I like wit, but when it's over the top it's over the top.

Enough with the negative, the afterlife mystery was intriguing and I'm pleased with Capaldi so far. Plus the ""listen"" episode was really good.

Skip to bottom if you don't want to read a wall of text. 

Here is my technical analysis, keep in mind I'm just a fan looking at a 5 second replay so things are likely off.

Mignolet did have poor positioning, Moreno was equally at fault but that doesn't mean anyone is forgiven. Via extensive microsoft paint footage and references I've compiled evidence of this.

**Ball lost:**

Balotelli loses ball, no one is covering ~~Gerrard~~ Lucas who is further forward.

Edit: As /u/notfaux pointed out it was Lucas.

**Just before the pass:**

Moreno is watching the ball, not Sahko meaning he loses him.

**Sahko receiving the ball:**

Moreno is too far forward, Sahko gets a run at goal and enough space to try the chip with very little pressure.

West Ham's #31 offside, assuming Lovren should mark.

**Sahko chipping:**

Moreno doesn't close him down quick enough, Sahko gets a free shot at goal and via a mix of vision and a brilliant finish he scores due to Mignolet moving too far forward to cover the near post, if he is intending to stop a cross I feel that he is in a poor position to do so anyway. Meanwhile before the ball leaves Sahko Lovren loses #31 for West Ham.

Edit: As /u/notfaux pointed out Gerrard left Noble a large amount of space.

**Sahko scores:**

No. 31 for West Ham the closest too a potential off the post tap in, Lovren and Mignolet helpless to do anything.

**Full goal:**

Just kidding. Mailing is still happening - I plan on accepting mail through the first week of October. I think with the rate that the mail is coming, I want to give it some more time. I've only received about 10 cards so far, but I think with the activity that this subreddit has, we should be aiming for at least a couple hundred. If necessary, I'll extend the period to the third week of October. I'd like to have it mailed to the club by the start of November.

Just a few quick words on a card will suffice - throw a stamp on it and send it over to one of the two addresses provided. The addresses are below.

In the UK (and many other countries) It is 18 to make the purchase of tobacco but 16 to still smoke it. This means

a) You get someone you know to do it for you or b) Try and purchase under-age.

In my opinion, this stops virtually nothing. I can get served underage and even if I didn't, I'd just have to ask my 18 year old friends to do it for me. This gives them the option to :

a) Overcharge me for it (for example, a pouch of baccy costs 4.25, then charge me 5 pounds.)

b) Lace it.

c) Steal it from me completely and not come out of the shop

Admittedly, if they do either of those three things, then they're not a friend. But It still doesn't make sense why It's 18 to buy but 16 to smoke. I don't think it stops anything.

The problems there been so far which I feel that can't be legal.

* Currently he is still without hot water in his room and bathroom. 
* They have entered his room without giving notice
* Sent painter with keys to his room and the flat without notice
* Changed office address without giving notice
* Gave him the wrong set of keys to someone else room twice before getting the right one. 
* No working washing machine 

I know there no cool off periods for leases but is there a way I can help him get out of the contract and into a better place? or is he screwed till end of contact. Also don't want to lose the deposit which is a month rent + £100 which is a LOT for a student.

I'm probably just reading into it, with a healthy dose of wishful thinking, but here's what I've got. 12 had the exchange with Journey Blue about him not taking her on as she was a soldier, and with Pink being a soldier, it's inevitably going to be brought up through Clara at some point. Twelve has been questioning his morality ever since his regeneration.

 At the End of the Doctor's Daughter, Martha tells him that she thought the Doctor finally found something he could live for, Jenny had quite a lot of significance to the Doctor in a difficult time, and could be part of the solution for his own internal demons. She is a reformed soldier, it fits nicely.

Now, here's where it starts to come sort of full circle, Capaldi mirrors Hartnell in some ways. The Doctor's on a new regeneration cycle, and it appears in some ways he's starting over. Grumpy old man who can be pretty cold. 

Hartnell traveled with his granddaughter, and two teachers from Coal Hill school. It looks like Twelve is about to have [two teachers](http://www.radiotimes.com/namedimage/Doctor_Who__Is_Danny_Pink_Clara_s_new_love_interest___or_is_he_something_more_.jpg?quality=85&amp;mode=crop&amp;width=620&amp;height=374&amp;404=tv&amp;url=/uploads/images/original/46372.jpg) from Coal Hill. Jenny could be Twelve's Susan. She's got Gallifreyan blood, and hell, if Steven really wanted to Moffuck us, Jenny could end up being Susan's mom. Who knows. Wouldn't be too unbelievable considering the absurd stuff he pulled in the 50th anniversary.

Don't get me wrong I know Moffat sold out to market the show to fanboys/girls and expand the viewing base, but I just would like him to leave as show runner and work full time on Sherlock so we could maybe get more than 3 episodes every 2 years. Moffat is far better at writing and working on Sherlock and other people could do Doctor Who. The beautiful thing about this show is just how diverse and different it can be.

Doctor Who is a very heavily plotted show. That's something I accept, because when it's good it infuses that plotty-wottiness (stolen from someone else, I wish I was that clever) with engaging characters (with believable motivations and fleshed-out arcs), unique settings (used in clever and surprising ways), brilliant pacing, wonderful villains and concrete themes. I think Time Heist didn't deliver on any of this.

Looking at some fan favourite episodes, all these things are present. Midnight is considered one of the best episodes of the new Doctor Who and is possibly my favourite of Tennant's run. It has well-rounded characters with opposing world-views from different background who can offer different perspectives on the same thing (something very important to DW as a show. Read: the purpose of companions), and allows those characters to be shaped by the plot without becoming slaves to it. In Midnight the characters were victims to the plot's machinations, never knowing what would happen next or where the nearest danger would come from. This works because the episode was designed to be creepy and scary, and by taking that control away from the characters we put them into a state of helplessness (a situation the Doctor doesn't often truly find himself in), forcing their backs against the wall and pushing them to act purely from their base instincts and desires; revealing their innermost personas. At the start of the episode the characters all got on in a civil manner, they didn't all like each other because of their differences but they tolerated each other. Little by little with the addition of pressure, the characters acted out against each other in line with their character, offering up the other characters to the monster of the episode. It's a great example of how you can use the plot to advance a character and vice versa.

Psi and Saibra weren't all that well-written. We only got a sense of who they were as characters when they stopped everything else to explicitly tell us about themselves (Psi's chat with Clara about his friends and family, Saibra's chat with the Doctor about how she can't touch or love). It's just less convincing and engaging than seeing the actions of a character that led to these realisations. Unfortunately, due to Time Heists superspeed pace and intense plotting we never have time for anything of that sort, instead we're faced with Psi going from one science interface to another and with Saibra changing shape because the plot demands it. When a character's only purpose is to advance the plot they become slaves to it, and don't have any room to grow or develop in a natural, organic way. Instead, we see them both sacrifice themselves; one of whom is a thief who literally tells the villain where he is so he can save the life of a girl he's just met while he's almost cracked into the most valuable safe in the universe. Let that sink in, he probably had an idea of what reward was waiting for him behind that door, so (being a thief) it would make sense to go in and get his reward, Clara be damned! But because the plot demanded it, he had to die. We find out he didn't die, but that doesn't mean his choice to die loses any weight. He returns to save Clara and the Doctor, still the nicest dude in the universe. He isn't changed by the experience of what is essentially suicide, just comes back and continues to help the plot mosey on along.

I'll sum up the motivation of the characters of Midnight; fear. Fear was a huge theme in that episode, and everything was drawn out of that theme. Thematically, Time Heist is flippy floppy, but I'll circle round to that. The characters all had an emotional journey instigated by fear, and all came out different for it, internally. Psi and Saibra are different at the end of Time Heist, but only because their circumstances have been changed by the plot; Psi gets his memories back and Saibra gets to touch and love. Both of those things could have been incredibly emotionally charged moments for the characters, but we don't get to see them. All we get is them TELLING us that they've changed. There's a lot more to do with character I could go on about, but I need to keep things moving before I hit the character maximum.

Anyways, setting.

Midnight was set inside a broken-down, luxury space-rover on the surface of a planet that would kill them all if they were directly exposed to it. A tiny metallic case with no TARDIS or conceivable way of physically escaping any situation inside. Perfect setting for a scary episode, claustrophobics might as well just stop watching. It's somewhere the show hasn't taken us before in many different senses; we've never seen this planet before, nor the people on it. We've never been in this luxury rover before, or anything like it. It's a unique and interesting setting for a story (in a show where the main character can travel through time and space it's surprising how often he's been in new millennium England*). It's something that DW can do that so many other shows just can't, it can give us literally ANYTHING as a setting. Midnight delivers on this.

Time Heist was set inside the universe's most secure bank, so secure that only a time traveller at a certain point in time could ever breach it's security. Not bad, actually. There could be quite an interesting story there! But Time Heist doesn't deliver like Midnight does because what we get from this interesting setting is the characters sneaking through air vents and walking into the secure vault. A condensed view of things, I know, but on the mark. Midnight's story could only have taken place in the setting of Midnight; Time Heist's story could have taken place in any number of settings. By this I mean the bare bones of the story, the beginning, middle and end are very generic, and aren't actually informed by the setting all that well. At a glance, it seems like it is, but in reality the story could have taken place aboard any old alien ship the doctor had suddenly appeared on after wiping his memory. Or perhaps even a space prison-city, or even a planet that's entirely made out of robots who don't like aliens with blue skin. The setting didn't inform the story, which again is something unique that Doctor Who can do which many shows can't. This time, it didn't anyways. Midnight's story HAS to be set where it is. To get that collection of characters feeling the way they did in the place they did, to change the way they did, act and react the way they did, you couldn't place them somewhere else; because the setting informed the story and passed onto it the setting's own unique qualities which were incorporated into the story very cleverly and effectively.

Midnight is a slow boil. It's about things heating up, beat by beat, step by step, moment after moment, push after push until something gives. It's paced this way to heighten the tension and make you jump, not always at a jump scare, but simply at developments in the story; like when Tennant and the 'Possessed' woman talk in sync for the first time, or when they try and kill Tennant because they're *scared*. Time Heist's pacing is nightmarish. Transitions between scenes are so abrupt and jarring it's as though Steven Moffat was leaning out of the screen and spitting some jammy dodger onto your face to let you know the scene had moved on. That's a rather passive aggressive way of saying it, but you get what I mean. Scenes always felt cut-short because the plot decreed that we had to rapidly move to another section of the story before we got bored or something, and because there was such a large number of scene transitions they all began to either feel the same or crazy choppy. There was even several times when the screen would do some form of sci-fi wipe where everything fades and blurs to a different colour for a second. My jaw was actually on the floor at the end of the episode when I realised these *weren't* plot points, and just simply poor style choices covering poorer writing. Midnight's story is so much more organic, it never feels like someone's telling you it, it tells itself. It stops becoming a story and becomes this living thing that you are a part of for 45 minutes. Watching Midnight feels like watching a feature film, watching Time Heist feels like watching a trailer for Time Heist.

Onto the villains, this section should be pretty short. Midnight's villain was equal parts genius and brave. Completely unlike any DW villains we're familiar with to this day! Unseen, unexplained, unbeatable. Three qualities that are tropes for DW villains, and it's what made it so scary. We never knew what to expect from it, we never knew anything about it, we (as viewers) were completely out of our comfort zone with it. As were the characters of the episode (that's called reliability and it's something Davies could do better than Moffat with his robotic motivations and cardboard cut-out characters). It was a scary story that needed a scary villain and Davies delivered with one of the show's scariest villains of all-time.

Time Heist's villain. Villains. Villain? Who's the villain? Villains? Is there/are there a villain/villains? What?! Let's break it down. There as Ms Delphox who appeared to be the main baddie, and she did fulfil that role; she antagonised the good guys, generally chased them and got in he way. Ah, but she was also pulling the strings of another villain; the scary looking 'Teller'. A clever concept for a monster handled rather poorly, with badly defined rules for what the limits of it's 'Powers' are, just in case the plot called for it to not detect the Doctor when it didn't suit (which happened). Finally we have Madame Karabraxos who pulling the strings of Ms Delphox all along! Aha! I have to admit I did like the twist about Delphox being a clone of Karabraxos, and how that tied into the theme of the episode. Positivity aside, these villains never really threatened the protagonists or did anything that really obstructed them in any way. Delphox catches, actually catches, Clara and the Doctor and instantly falls into the badguy trope of telling the henchmen to finish them off just after she leaves. Another poor character motivation driven by the plot. We know for a fact the bank is designed to incinerate people at a moments notice, and that the Teller can literally turn people's heads to mush in seconds (both of these she's totally fine with) but no. The plot says otherwise. So she had to make a poorly motivated decision as the baddie. The Midnight monsters's motivations were unknown; was it trying to speak? To breed? To feed? To plead? We never knew and we never found out. Which is terrifying and threatening. Karabraxos is confronted and then instantly is let go by our main man; The Doctor. He does this for his own motivations which we find out is to free the Teller and his partner, so I can't complain there as that is very much in keeping with who the Doctor is. The only problem is that Karabraxos is a total non-character. She just isn't a player within the story, we don't meet her until the end, her change in character happens 100% off screen and we know almost nothing about her. Why? Because the plot called for it. For Steven Moffat's clever little time-travel heist story to make any sense the characters had to make less sense. Sacrifices had to be made for the good of his precious plot.

Finally, themes.

I touched on this earlier, Midnight's main theme was fear. Everything in that story could be rooted back to fear in some way; fear of the monster, fear of the Doctor, fear of being trapped, fear of the fellow passengers, and finally, in a great moment of development, fear of themselves. That's what Midnight's theme achieves. It makes us look inside ourselves and realise the only *real* monster was us all along; not even a rogue element, the real core of who we are as humans. And isn't that scary? Time Heist's theme (from what I gather) was reflection. Looking at yourself, who you are and making judgements about yourself. On paper, it delivers on this theme. We have a thief who deleted his memories and wants nothing more than to have them back. A shape shifter who can't love anyone, because if she touches them she literally looks like them. They sound good, right? Right. Unfortunately it's the execution of these concepts where the episode falls flat. The only thematic moments are (again) just when they characters decide to externalise their feelings with character exposition. The words were there, ""Could you trust someone who looked back at you out of your own eyes?"" from Saibra, ""Clara, for what it’s worth, and it might not be worth much, when your whole life flashes in front of you, you see people you love and people missing you.  And I see no one."" from Psi and ""I hate him!  He’s overbearing, he’s manipulative, likes to think that he’s very clever.  I hate him!  Clara, don’t you see?  I hate the Architect!"" from the Doctor.

Sounds good. But it's only really the Doctor's one that has any impact on anything. It's his realisation that he hates himself that leads him to understand the situation they're all in and save the day. It comes from within his own character, the solution of the episode is part of who he is as a person, not some cool neural interface or shapeshiftery. It's the best scene in the episode for good reason, it tells the story using the needs and feelings of a character instead of the demands and orders from the plot. If only the rest of the episode had been structured that way.

As a final note, here's a quick few thoughts on how I would have improved the episode:

1 Make it a 2-parter. It needed to slow down, and it needed more context. It could have maintained the weird time-jumps in the story as a mechanic for letting us experience time travel, while letting us get to kow nd understand the problems facing Psi and Saibra, with one of then potentially have some kind of catharsis by the end.

2. That's actually all I've got. Sorry. I'm tired, bed'll help.

We do not have a big enough squad to compete in the PL, Europa League, League Cup and the FA Cup. The League Cup is by far the least prestigious in that list, and the only real benefit from winning is seeing us win a trophy. That would be the fucking bomb, but I'd way rather finish in the top 6 of the PL than win a trophy. It pays out £100,000, which is about enough money to pay Baines for 2 weeks. You 'win' 75 times that amount by coming last in the PL. You get £1.8m for winning the FA Cup, which is okay and it's also a more well respected trophy. 

We might have enough players to compete is all these competitions if we include all the kids, but we've got a tough group in Europe so until we qualify we can't really afford to play inexperienced youngsters. 

And let's not forget, we've got the Redshite this weekend. We always play like shit at Anfield, and Gerrard is gona score against us I can feel it. I've been an Everton fan for a long time and I don't think I've ever seen Gerrard have a shit game against us at Anfield. I'd rather Bobby plays no one tomorrow that he's gona play this weekend.

Also, how does financial aid work for international students?

I have a thousand more questions but I'm going to start here for now.

- Unwarranted optimism.
- Arsenal has begun their traditional injury crisis early this year, and will sport a likely back four of Chambers, Kos, Mertesacker, Gibbs with Bellerin bench. In other words, we might get lucky. Plus, given Arsenal's luck, someone might kick a ball into Mertesacker's shin in practice, breaking it, and then we're playing against youth team first-timers.
- No Giroud. Welbeck is not as good of a pure CF in my opinion. Although Giroud is unquestionably shit. This one might not be a positive.
- Pochettino conjures some Argentine magic, something something, result is better play and an early goal that sets the tone.
- I think the West Brom showing is explained by this: Momentarily, the space-time fabric ripped and North London was temporarily a portal into an alternate universe where everything is shit, there is no justice in the world, puppies are hideously ugly, and nobody likes cats. Fortunately, that quantum space-time rip has been subsequently repaired. Back to normalcy. Remember the QPR game?? Time for a rebound.

**Round-Up Monday:** Weekly Round-Up as can be seen [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/SaintsFC/comments/2h47k6/saintswatch_15th_to_21st_september_2014/)

**Quiz Tuesday:** This will start next Tuesday and will consist of between five and ten questions that should help put your brain into gear on a cold Tuesday morning. Please try not to google or wikipedia any questions, that would be pretty pointless! Answers should be PM'd to me so that nobody else can see them although you can post in the comments things along the lines off ""Question 7 took me forever to get"" as long as you don't reveal hints on the answers. Deadline is the following day at midnight. 

**Throwback Wednesday** Southampton through history. Each Wednesday I'll post something that took place on this same week many years before. It could be our position in the league table at that current time or a squad line up or a new signing. This will start tomorrow. 

**Video Thursday** Every Thursday I'll post a video from a personal collection of my favourites, it could be an interview, goal, highlights of a match. Anything Southampton related that I think you'll all enjoy. The results from Tuesday's quiz will also be revealed as well as the users who got the highest score. 

**Feature Friday** I started this last week with my short history of the Portsmouth derby. This will continue every Friday with a different topic. 

**Saturday and Sunday** As it's the weekend, I won't be posting anything new here and there will almost always be match threads and fresh football to watch instead! 

---
Also, I'll be down in Southampton the weekend after this coming one, anyone free for a drink Friday/Saturday night?

1) Clara has already intertwined herself in the Doctor's timeline. Even more so as of the episode ""Listen"". What if there was a deeper reason for this connection more than coincidence?

2) In that same episode, they went out of their way to say that the Doctor was an orphan. Obviously they plan on revisiting this at some point, and it would only make sense to have Clara be a part of it since she was the one who heard this information.

3) ""Half human on my mother's side."" This has probably been retconned in an audio adventure, book, or comic, but it has never been dealt with in the show proper. This is the kind of thing I think Moffat would love to leave his stamp on.

4) Since the 50th special, it seems like Moffat is teasing something HUGE. Obviously he wants to bring back past Doctors in some fashion, maybe as the ""original faces"" of his various regenerations, but that's not earth shattering enough. I feel like he's planning something bigger than that.

I just came up with this. Even if it's not possible, it's still an interesting thought!

Somewhere down the line (use your imagination), the Doctor restores Gallifrey. The Time Lords are once again the judges of all of time and space, and they start by apprehending the Master (who is Missy, by the way, just putting that out there...) and bringing him to trial for all of his crimes. (I know, it's a stretch, just go with it for now)

The Master is found guilty of crimes against the universe, and it comes time for his sentencing. The Time Lords decide that since the Master has indeed helped them in the past, they will give him two choices. First option, they can execute him, and all of his future regenerations until he has none left, and finally dies forever. Second option, they give him a new cycle of regenerations, however, this cycle would be a fresh start. He would retain none of his memories from his past, and would begin life anew as a Gallifreyan child. 

He takes the second choice.

The young boy grows up alone, with no parents, in an orphanage. He has no recollection of who he is, who his parents are, and how he got to the orphanage. Loneliness and fear of what terrible past could have lead him to where he is drive him to tears, and he spends most of his days and nights crying, to the point where they have him sleep in a barn, so as not to bother the other children.

Until one night, he has a dream. He sits up in bed and a hand grabs his ankle from under the bed. He's terrified, until a voice tells him it's just a dream, go back to sleep. He lays back down, and a few minutes later he hears the same voice talking to him. She tells him not to worry, that it's okay to be scared. That fear makes him strong. 

The sound of the TARDIS follows shortly afterwards, and he falls asleep, for the first time a glimmer of hope for the future. 

He decides to become a Time Lord. As all Time Lords must at some point, he looks into the Schism, and sees all of time and space, and for just one minute, he sees his past life. All the pain he brought. 

He runs.

Later, the boy becomes a Time Lord. As is customary, all Time Lords choose a name for themselves. Not fully remembering why, the boy is filled with a subconscious need to heal the wounds he caused. To be kind. To never be cruel, or cowardly.

Sorry for bothering the sub with not really direct Chelsea news or chatter.

So I think I may have purchased a fake kit. I was just wondering if you guys may be able to help me tell if its fake or not. First, I got it from Classicfootballshirts.co.uk, which from everything I have read, their shirts are all club licensed shirts. I bought a 2011/12 goalkeeper shirt (The white one from Munich). 

All of the key things look right, climacool logo, the adidas hologram, the hanging tag code matches the small tag at the neck. But the shirt just is bigger than my home kit from that year (Both Medium). And I am just a little concerned by that. I have seen often that fake kits are larger than club licensed ones. Also it has a tag about ""not to slide on the ground in the shirt as it can cause burns,"" and out of my other kits (5 Chelsea and 3 Danish National Team) only one has that tag (This years away kit).

If anyone can add comment to the sizing of their keeper jerseys that would be much appreciated. I may just be paranoid but I paid for what I thought was a legit shirt and feel I may have gotten a fake one.

1.   The lineup and even formation seems to change match to match.  Is this common every week, or will we likely get settled in and see consistency week to week?

1. Match starting times changed a couple of times since I created the Google Calendar, should I be checking West Ham's site regularly for updates?

1. Our transfers seem to be working out quite well, and I see in the Summer transfers thread there is an amount they are signed for, where can I find out the length of their contracts?

She uses a wheelchair to get around most places but prefers to use a wheeled walker to get around when indoors (like this: http://www.betterlifehealthcare.com/view_product.php?prodID=109).


So I'm looking for your advice and suggestions

1) A friendly hotel - would need a walk-in shower and shower seat. This is probably the most important one. We stayed a hotel before that claimed to be disabled friendly, only to find that there was a large step into the shower and no shower chair! She had to use a patio plastic chair instead, and this I found completely unacceptable. 

2) Where could I hire the walker mentioned above. She will be flying with the wheelchair so can't bring both with her.

3)Any recommendations on what we could do. She will be here for about 4 days and was thinking of taking a show in. Anything else that would be highly recommended but probably indoors as it will be towards the end of next month

**Positives**:

We actually had a storming first half, due to the fact that Higginbotham and Lawless were overlapping each other’s runs, switching wings, and generally running at the defence and causing havoc. 

Doolan is also very mobile and his movement off the ball is of a high standard, exemplified in our goal. I tried to illustrate this in the graph but it's quite hard to show, and therefore I left his runs blank. 

We were relatively solid defensively in the first 45 minutes, while St Mirren had a few chances in the first half, there weren't any serious threats and most were from long range. Jake Carroll is sometimes making runs down the left into the space vacated by Higginbotham or Lawless, but he seems very under confident in doing so, a point we'll come to in the second part. McMillan is just a solid defender and can play across the back four, at least I have seen him play in every position. He excels as a full back on the right side. 

Osman has been nothing short of brilliant so far this season and was again. He is constantly looking to break up the play and keep the ball, his through balls are also threatening from that area, genuinely amazed by his signing. I realise he was at fault for the penalty, but to be honest I always thought St Mirren were likely to score when going forward after their substitutions and we were not pressing them hard enough. 

**Negatives**

The second half in general was nothing short of abysmal from us. As illustrated, normally our 'wing backs' (McMillan is not a wing back) would drive forward and provide width, and press the opposition into making errors. However it was the exact opposite while defending. Sitting back, the team in general looked nervous and the first goal for St Mirren came from a wonderful cross with absolutely no one closing the player down. 

This brings in the midfield, whose job it is to press the middle. Stevenson seemed to be running all over the park like a mad man, yet he was constantly behind whoever he was chasing, and, while he put a lot of effort in, he wasn't really contributing much. Bannigan was cut taking far too long on the ball a few times, a sign of things to come was in the first half when he was robbed of possession and St Mirren launched a dangerous counter attack. Osman played very well again, although at fault for the penalty he was constantly hassling the opponents and was quick and accurate with the ball. 

Osman and McMillan aside, I don't think many others deserve plaudits. Many of the attacking players seemed to wane in influence as the game went on, but this should not be indicitive of the team as a whole. The defenders were very nervous, this could be down to feeling more comfortable with an experienced defender in the back line, or with an experienced goal keeper. We let Lee Mair go, which, in my opinion, was the correct decision. Seabourne also looks like an excellent upgrade, but he's already missed games due to being unfit, and we only have 3 senior centre backs in the squad. 

**Solutions**

In short I think we need to do two things right now, and neither of them is to stop playing attacking football. Firstly we need to force the wing backs up the pitch, I'd prefer to at least see one of them contributing to attacking play and Osman filling the gap when they move forward. This also means the opposition will be pressed higher up the pitch. For me it's simpler to allow McMillan to play left back, and have O'Donnell playing right wing back where he was excellent for us in the promotion campaign. He was out injured for large parts of last season, and wasn't really as assured when he did get game time. This year I believe he can go to another level and prove he's capable in this division. 

The second thing we have to do is either put Gallagher in goal instead of Fox, or find a fit rugged centre back that commands the defense. Unluckily, if Man Utd can't get one with all their money, I think the easier option is for Gallagher to be put back in goals. He commands his area better than Fox, and although both keepers are good enough for this level, I think this part of his game is more important just now. 

**TL;DR Balls out brilliant in the first half, completely Jim White in the second**

So far, a running theme has been the doctor trying to find his place and ""if he is a good man"". None of his prior recent incarnations really go through that struggle, so with the reinstated regeneration cycle are we seeing a fresh doctor - void of his prior identity - or is this doctor blocking out his prior personalities, either intentionally or otherwise.

Prior doctors always had an aura of control over nearly every situation, building and building to the big tada moment where the doctor clues the world in to how they did exactly as he intended all along... This doctor instead seems unsure about the world, and doesn't seem to put the puzzle pieces together with ease or grace.

With that said, does anyone else notice this too? Even as an older looking incarnation, it surprises me that the doctor no longer considers himself ten steps ahead (it seems).

I'm 16 (male) and have a terrible spot problem. My chin and forehead are the worst places, although really, anywhere on my face is a target where they appear. Usually on my chin there will be three or four big painful spots with a load of small ones (which always stay), and similar on my forehead. 

Mainly the issue with them is low confidence. Obviously I'm 16 and at High School, so it's an issue because I'm always around other people. When I speak to others I can see them looking at my spots and it's not nice. I really need to sort it out, as you can imagine.

I have naturally oily skin, and I'm using a witch hazel face wash to combat that. Once I first started using it (night and day), my spots cleared quite a lot. They appear to have gotten worse though now recently. 

I've used so many creams and treatments I can't even remember them all, but some include: Clearasil Rapid Action Treatment Cream (not effective), T-Zone Rapid Action (not effective), TCP (not effective at all), Lemon Juice (I was desparate, and it didn't work), Toothpaste (again, desparate. This one didn't not work, it just wasn't pleasant and didn't work sooooo good to make me carry on using it) and probably the most effective being Sudocream. 

Sudocream has been the most effective, and it's what I've been using most nights. Cons include it being thick and uncomfortable (my whole face is spotty so I need to put it all over) and it can get on my pillows and scare people in my house I walk past.

Points: 4

Preferred formation: varies widely, but lately 4-1-4-1

It’s hard to know where Sunderland are *at*, as the Americans say, or what exactly to expect from them this year. They've barely kept a consistent formation, were uninspired when we met them at Loftus Road, but at home they have picked up impressive draws against Man Utd and Tottenham. 

Sunderland’s big goal in the transfer window was to pick up a striker. This was meant to be Borini, but as we all know, he would rather keep the bench warm as Liverpool’s 4th-choice striker than move to a team further down the table. 

This has rather landed Sunderland in the soup as they seriously lack firepower up front, and Poyet is left scrambling for a system that compensates for their weak strikeforce. Against WBA he tried playing Fletcher as a lone striker with Connor Wickham supporting from midfield; against Utd and us he played a 4-3-3 with Wickham, Fletcher and Buckley/Johnson; and in the last two games, played Wickham as a lone striker. 

Wickham starting every game might give the impression that he’s been playing well. But really, it’d be more accurate to describe him as the best of a bad bunch. From what I’ve seen, when he has the ball he knows how to lash it, but generally speaking he is stationary and makes very few runs to look for the ball. Big guy, but a bit too soft and easy to push around. Danny Graham hardly looks convincing either, and will most likely be their cup-guy. Fletcher is a little past it, not having looked his previous quality in a fair while now. 

That in mind, I think it’s a safe bet that in January, Sunderland will seek to strengthen. Sunderland are the [22nd highest spending team](http://www.football-observatory.com/IMG/pdf/wp82_eng.pdf) in the last five years in *all of Europe*, so don’t be surprised if they manage to conjure up another few million to drop on a quality player.

Until then though, Poyet should be grateful to his midfield for picking up the slack. Sunderland’s midfield – usually some combination of Cattermole, Larsson, Rodwell and Johnson –  is their biggest strength: robust and physical, high pass completion rate and retains possession like a mid-table team. Poyet has always been a ‘safety first’ kinda guy, and just as was the case at Brighton, his Sunderland seeks first and foremost to be difficult to break down. Their forward-going threat comes from Johnson’s pace and Larsson’s crosses, as well as set pieces. Van Aanholt, the speedy left-wingback, has also actually been one of their best offensive assets. But with an ineffective striking force, it’s simultaneously alarming and impressive that all five of their goals have come from midfielders. 

Having said all that, aside from the striker situation, this Sunderland team actually looks pretty decent. They have two good goalkeepers in Mannone and Pantilimon and a pretty mean-looking defence. For that reason we should all keep our fingers crossed that Sunderland have very few points once January rolls around and they get a chance to buy a striker. 

However, their fixture list currently looks pretty sympathetic, having already drawn with Tottenham and Man Utd. Their first win of the season probably won't come against Arsenal or Southampton, but Swansea and Stoke at home as well as Crystal Palace away are points available for the taking. Once the 10th gameweek finishes, I’ll expect Sunderland to have between 9 and 11 points.

On the one hand, it seems that the time lords granting the Doctor a new set of regenerations would undue him dying at Trenzalore, so it would no longer house his grave. On the other hand, the Doctor visited his grave in the Name of the Doctor, which would mean that if he isn't entombed there, he created a massive paradox. 

But it could also have something to do with Clara entering his timeline to repair it, which may lead to some pretty big ramifications for his entire life span, perhaps rewriting history so that place is no longer where he dies.

Listen. The Doctor gets this fear of his because of Claire grabbing his foot from under the bed. But she was there because of his fear. Where did this initial fear come from if Claire didn't originally grab his leg.... Time paradox.

In my opinion, I think the formation that best fits our squad right now would be a 4-4-2 a la Man City, where the two wide players would alternate drifting inside. In attack, we have Eriksen and Lamela, who could easily play the roles of Nasri and Silva, albeit not on the same level. We have a large target man in Adebayor, who could arguably be more dangerous than Dzeko in a pressing system, due to him having a better workrate than Dzeko. We have a (once? Hopefully still) clinical finisher in Soldado who is also effective in buildup play... I'm not claiming to know more than Poch, but it just makes sense, especially when the 4-4-2 is a natural pressing formation to begin with.

-----

I do not think Capaldi's Doctor is at all that dark, but he sure is manipulative. Capaldi gives a good showing and was genuinely distracted in the first episode, but ever after that you can see glimpses of how he actually damn well knows what he is doing. The flashes in the end of 8x05 support that theory with him starting as a caretaker at the school.. perhaps to spy on Clara and to be a wedge between him and Pink.

I'd be sad if it's just another part of the pattern where most companions have a distraction that gets between the companion and the Doctor. I mean, Rose was distracted by Mickey, Amy by Rory and now Clara by Pink. With Martha it was actually the Doctors feelings for Rose and the brief affair with Joan when the Doctor was a ""human"" (*he ""had to go and fall in love with a human and it wasn't me""*).

His charade must have some ulterior motive beyond just stopping the Impossible girl from dating Mr. Pink, I hope. I don't know about you guys, but I just feel that if Pink is just another episode in the saga of companion swoons the Doctor and then falls in love with another human, I'll be dissapointed.

Someone might say that in this episode he felt nothing as Psi and Mutant died, but I reckon you just won't wipe a Time Lords memory completely with a worm as he seems to let on - so he probably knew they did not die. If anything, a being of his age probably has good control over his thoughts and can just block the Teller at will, but in order for the premise to work, he plays along. He also admits his plan is just to wait and see, typicly the doctor doesn't want to admit this.

With those points in mind, I'd say the twelth Doctor is a very manipulative Doctor, even moreso as his predecessors. He wants to appear old, dark and cynical, but you can see glimpses of the playful Doctor when he is trying to ruin Claras dates.

Or maybe he just is dark and it's all about the eyebrows. Who knows ;)

I'm currently studying and get financial support from SFE. I get around 9k a year in student loans/grants plus I get 4k a year in disability benefits, which will continue for the foreseeable future as I've got a life long disability. It totals 13k-ish a year. It works out at 1k a month if it was a salary.

Me and my fiancee are both studying although her course is part time and not eligible for loans and grants from SFE, only tuition. We want to move out as soon as possible once we graduate and get jobs so building credit is important now. I've recently taken out a phone contract as my credit history is none existent (although not *bad* per se) and she has a phone contract as well as an Argos card and other bits and bobs. We're desperate to move out as soon as we can as I'm 22, she's 23 and we live with her parents, but when we graduate we'll both be getting to the wrong side of 25 and we want to start a family.

One pub I remember for sure is the Museum Tavern across from the British Museum. They had many *types* of beers but probably very few beers I recognized at the time. It's also very possible I was introduced to the concept here - having had a lengthy chat with a couple locals.

This picture hints at what I'm remembering, having only ""local"" beers on draft: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/museum-tavern-london?select=Bmd75XJUfwoLUWS4IXJr0A#Bmd75XJUfwoLUWS4IXJr0A

I will update shortly with the dimensions - what I want to do is stick a Policebox door on the front of it, then open it to show the TARDIS console, with the effect being that you feel like you are actually looking into the TARDIS. I can only really print off images with a high quality printer, so was planning on cutting out a 2-D Smith or Tenant that has a speech bubble attached to it saying ""Hello, I'm the Doctor"" next to the console.

If anyone is able to help me by modifying an image like [this](http://pichost.me/1902386/) to give it a 3D effect, I would be super super grateful!

Dimensions: Height = 300mm, Width = 100mm, Depth = 350mm

Pigeonholes look like this: [example]http://pwalshandsons.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Picture281.jpg)
Mine is vertical however, not horizontal.

Thanks in advance!

For the last 3 or so years i've liked Southampton a lot though and to be honest, I like Liverpool winning but if Middlesbrough would've won I would've laughed. Not much of a fan then, am I? 

Now as I've always liked the Saints and Pelle and Tadic just came in, together with the Koeman brothers, I decided to finally come and join this subreddit, and actually follow the club. I've watched every match this season and I'm not going to change that for now. However, I wouldn't call me a fan yet because I'm not sick for days when we lose, I don't know any of the history either. 

So I was wondering, what are the absolute basics on Southampton? The things you cant mention here? The biggest legends? The most hated players, rivals, tragedies, that sort of stuff. I've gotten a bit of google but it's not all as easy.

I've just returned from a dream holiday for my fairly young self and have been thinking for ages before I went that I'd continue to holiday saving I had been doing into life savings to go towards a house deposit or similar.

Now after very good saving I have basically most of the holiday money set aside left and want to maximise the money sitting with no risk (ie not investing, for now at least).

[My previous post](http://www.reddit.com/r/UKPersonalFinance/comments/2chom4/taking_advantage_of_new_current_account_incentives/) (with no comments =( ) mentioned how I was thinking about taking advantage of current account offers for free money.  Now I want to think about interest.

I've seen [MoneySavingExpert](http://www.moneysavingexpert.com/savings/best-regular-savings-accounts) post about the best regular savings accounts and 6% sounds great.  But I'm only going to get 6% on my first £300.  Every other monthly payment will increase the balance, but the overall interest will go down.

Would it be better to (when I get to £3000) to just shove it in a 123 current account for their constant 3%?

Thanks for this, interesting. 


IRISH BLARNEY FED BY BORROWED ETHNIC SYMBOLS
A Newspaper article by a Des Ekin has exposed that Irish Blarney is fed by borrowed ethnic symbols.


The following reveal the Irish mythology of ""Sinn Fein "" - ""ourselves alone"":-


1. GUINNESS; now owned by Diageo, an international corporation with headquarters in London. The Guinness family were always very strong unionists, the family spoke in the House of Commons to recommend the execution of the leaders of the 1916 rising. Arthur was strongly against the 1798 rebellion, so much so, that his renamed his drink ‘Protestant Porter’. The Guinness family also played a crucial role in the forming of the Orange Order in Dublin.


2. BAILEY'S IRISH CREAM; as above - owned by Diageo.


3.JAMESON IRISH WHISKEY; distilled in Cork but owned by the giant French company Pernod Richard (who also own Powers).


4. ST. PATRICK; A WELSHMAN WHO STUDIED IN FRANCE.


5. THE HARP; It was common in the Orient, Egypt and Mesopotamia thousands of years before it popped up in Ireland around 800 AD.


6. THE HA'PENNY BRIDGE DUBLIN; it was made in Coalbrookdale, Shropshire.


7. THE DUBLIN SPIRE; although the sections were trimmed and welded together in Dungarvan, the Spire was designed by English architects, milled and polished in France, rolled in Glasgow, and connected with flanges from Germany.


8. U2; two members of the Irish band were born in England - the Edge (Essex) and Adam Clayton (Oxford) Bono, U2s lead singer, his mother was a Protestant, Iris Elizabeth Rankin. He was brought up a Protestant, educated at The Inkwell, a small Protestant Church of Ireland school.


9. THE SHAMROCK; firstly, it's not uniquely Irish, and secondly, nobody knows exactly which herb St. Patrick had in mind - it could be white clover, wood sorrell, or something else.


10. THE POTATO; an Englishman introduced it from America.


11. ST. PATRICK'S DAY PARADES: an American idea. The first took place in New York in 1762.


12. THE BODHRAN; not traditional Irish - it was first introduced in the 1800's. In fact there's only one uniquely Irish insrtument - the uilleann pipe.


13. RIVERDANCE; based on dance steps created by a guy from Chicago.


14. DANNY BOY; an English woman heard the tune in Colorado and sent it back to her brother-in-law Fred Weatherley, a Somerset lawyer, who wrote words in what he imagined was Oirish style (""Tis I'll be here"") in 1912.


15.THE FORTY SHADES OF GREEN: despite unlikely references to turf-diggers in Dublin, most people believe it to be an Irish song - but was written in 1961 by US singer Johnny Cash.


16. IT'S A LONG WAY TO TIPPERARY; written in 24 hours to win a bet, and the author, Jack Judge from Birmingham, had never been to Ireland. There may have been a risque double meaning - the ""Tipperary"" was reputed to have been a Soho brothel.


17. GALWAY BAY (the song): written by Leicester resident Dr. Arthur Coleman, a former officer in the British Army Medical Corps., and only became popular when it was recorded by an American, Bing Crosby, in 1947.


18. THE IRISH WOLFHOUND ; the wolfhounds we know today are the result of breeding by a British army officer, Capt. G.A. Graham, who rescued the last few Irish specimens from extinction.


19. THE MOUNTAINS OF MOURNE (the song): written by Roscommon man Percy French it is hardly an Irish song,since it was written for English Music Hall audiences, who enjoyed the racist humour about the Paddy so stupid he thinks roadworkers are digging for gold.


20. IRISH COFFEY: nobody had heard of it before 1942, when it was invented to give to foreign travellers passing through the aerodrome at Foynes.


21. THE IRISH RACE; it's unlikely that there was ever a thing as a pure Irish race; most of the Irish are a mongrel mix of Celtic, French, Spanish, English, Norwegian, and Danish.


22. THE CELTS; come to think of it ""Celt"" is kind of hard to define, too, but let's not push that point or we'll have to close all those hippie bead stalls and repaint those new-age pubs in Galway and Kerry.


23. BROWN THOMAS STORE (DUBLIN); owned by Canadian Galen Weston.


24. JAMES JOYCE; although born in Dublin, he got out of Ireland as soon as he could and spent most of his life on the Continent.


25. THE CRAIC; don't believe the tourist guff. Crack is English . The word ""craic"" is a recent quasi-Irish version of ""crack"", an old English word defined as lively conversation,


26. THE REPUBLIC. OF IRELAND SOCCER TEAM; if on reading that listed you doubt that there is anything that the Irish can lay claim to being solely their own - there is consolation in one institution which nobody can deny to be 100% Irish:-

These subreddits could be successful communities for discussing affairs and events in your wider area that would otherwise be missed by /r/unitedkingdom and your town/county/city subreddit.

Mr. Salah bin Ghanem bin Nasser Al Ali, Minister of Youth and Sports in Qatar sat on a high-backed leather chair in the private meeting room of Emir Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani. This grand space was dominated by a large crystal fountain and punctuated with solid gold fittings; some foreign dignitaries had described the Royal Palace as ostentatious, but Qatari Royals felt at home in such spaces. 

He had been summoned for a private discussion with the Qatari Head of State- a concerning development in the life of any Qatari Politician as Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani was not known for casual discussions with ministers. Being called to his chambers was all to often a death knell in careers; Salah bin Ghanem bin Nasser Al Ali knew this as well as any, but his face betrayed no signs of concern. 

The large, ornate door swung open and the Emir walked through, as Salah bin Ghanem bin Nasser Al Ali began to stand from his chair Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani gestured for him to sit down. As The Emir took his seat, a servant entered the room with a green mint beverage for the Emir and his guest. The leader took a sip, and much to the internal amusement of Salah bin Ghanem bin Nasser Al Ali, the drink left green sediment on his upper lip- he decided however it would be best to keep this observation to himself.

""It has come to my attention that my country has posted a bid to host the Football World Cup, against my better judgement I am giving you 1 minute of my time to explain yourself."" The Emir questioned, with the voice of a man who is blissfully familiar with the authority that his words project. 

""Most certainly Your Highness- The World Cup in Qatar will bring the world together on our shores. We will be able to shout the image of a modern, wonderful Qatar to audiences that we would...""

""Stop"" The Emir interjected. ""It is not the benefits that concern me, it is the fact we are putting ourselves on the chopping block to international ridicule. Nobody will vote for us- a tiny oil rich state in one of the hottest regions on Earth, with no football history! You have brought shame on my country!""

""No, Your Highness- that is where you are misguided. We have a man on the inside- a man who can make things happen.""

---

      Zurich - December 2010

Salah bin Ghanem bin Nasser Al Ali's  Ministerial Telephone rang out. Still jubilant, and somewhat surprised his plan had worked so perfectly, he struggled to gain the composure required to talk about official business. 

The voice on the other line was loud, but distorted with the sounds of people cheering, and the distinct sound of either fireworks or guns being fired ""Salah bin Ghanem bin Nasser Al Ali, you are a genius!"", the minister recognised the voice of the Emir instantly. ""I don't know how you did it, but you are a national hero!""

""Not me Your Highness, my man on the inside"" Salah bin Ghanem bin Nasser Al Ali announced with a calmness that surprised even himself. 

""Bring him here, bring yourself here- I must shower you with gifts! I have a private jet landing in Zurich in 2 hours, please pack your belongings and make sure your friend is treated in the way a national hero should be""

The phone hung-up with a click. The minister reached into his pocked and grabbed an old Nokia 3310, to which he dialed a number from memory. 

""Are you free to speak?..... The Emir has requested your presence in Qatar, I think we are in for quite the party.... Your fee? Oh I am sure that will not be an issue..... You demand what!?..... I don't know if that can be done.... I will see what we can do. A car will be waiting for you outside the Hotel Leoneck in 45 minutes, please don't be tardy""

The minister hung up the phone, removed the SIM Card and swallowed it hole. He then walked to the edge of balcony where he was standing and dropped the Nokia off, 13 stories onto the roof of the hotel car park. It seemingly remained perfectly in tact, leading the minister to make a request from hotel staff to retrieve his dropped device, which, once returned he slipped into the waste disposal furnace.

      Doha - Qatar - 13 hours later

Emir Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani entered the suite where Salah bin Ghanem bin Nasser Al Ali sat with a look of sheer childlike delight on his face. He grabbed the minister by the shoulders and shook him with excitement.

""Where is your man Salah bin Ghanem bin Nasser Al Ali?"" said the Emir, his face beaming, ""I want to shake this man's hand""

""Agent!"" The minister bellowed, and with that the side door to the room opened, and a short, bald, angry looking man with a light goatee beard, an orange tie and a grey suit approached the Emir.

""Iyme Ian, good to meet you mayt"" the man said, extending a hand to shake ""but you can carl me Ollie, other people do"".

The Emir was taken aback, never before had he met someone so direct. Usually people were overawed with his power, but his man... This man was something different. Maybe he is a man of great power himself the Emir though, but no, his voice indicates nothing of the sort. He is probably just really simple. 

""You liyke what Ei did with't World Cup thing then, got you yer votes and dat"".

""Yes, yes"" The Emir said, finally finding a space to fit the words in ""You have done me a great service""

""If only tha'bellend Wayne Rooney could see me now. Lookin' arl smug wanting to go out on a free like a todger. Me, blumin' Ian Olloway schmoosin with the big wigs in their golden rooms"". Does this man not have a filter for his internal monologue the Emir thought, but that soon past as the short, angry man began tapping the table laid out with snacks.

""Good construction this, solid, good materials, must have set you back a few grand, good taste mate"" 

""If you want it"" the Emir said ""I can arrange for it to be taken back to your residence""

""Ooooooooohhhhhhhhh tryin' to buy me off now are you. Well nothing gets past me. Try and set me up on a dodgy wicket, but I hit a cover drive for 6. Your man ere' knows my price and I aint budgin'.""

""Is this so, Mr. Salah bin Ghanem bin Nasser Al Ali?"" 

""Yes.. Well.. You Highness.. He is asking rather a lot""

""Anything, anything for Ollie!, he has done more for this country than anyone alive!""

""No, you don't understand you highness- he wants to manage a football team in European competition""

""Then that is no problem, we buy club, we put him manager of club- you manage Paris Football Ollie, everyone happy"" The Emir approached the orange tied, suited man with his hand out to seal the deal.

""No."" Was the man's response ""I aint managing some shitty team in some country where they eat frogs. I aint avin' that- it has to be Engerland. I know I got some stick in the past, but I know I harv some great tactics that are going to blow the whole of European competition away""

""Well, then we will find you an English team""

The minster held his hand up and began to speak. ""Your highness, it won't be that easy. English clubs have a standard of manager that they try to uphold, the fans would smell a rat if this man became manager""

""We just make the owner lose a bet with us"" said the Emir ""Like when those chicken boys didn't sign Ronaldinho and they had to keep that Kean man as manager.. Oh that was so funny"" 

""No, you highness, you don't understand. Holloway is not just bad, he is toxic jet-propelled hyper shit- there is no way we could get him into a European team""

The Emir paused, he looked dejected until a lightbulb turned on in his brain 

""We have methods. Our Qatar Foundation Scientists are currently working on mind transportation. We are a few years away, but soon we will be able to transport a brain between two bodies. Once the technology is perfected in 3-4 years, we could arrange a friendly in a country with low hotel security in SE Asia, and simply transport the brain of Ollie into that of a real manager. He will then be able to try out his tactics in Europe, and know once and for all if they will work""

""My great Emir. My Royal Highness... I think you have cracked it!""

Could anyone recommend a good point of action for dealing with noise pollution in particular noisy neighbours?

Two nights in a row they've played music till midnight then from 3am onwards. 

Guessing it's due to fresher's (I'm assuming they are students) and the excitement but it's really making life difficult for myself and my girlfriend.

I'm going to talk to them tomorrow. Perhaps they don't realise how well low frequency sound can travel through ceilings.

If they don't listen, what's the next point of action? What would you do if you were in the same boat?

I work 6 days, some days starting at 7am and box 5 days a week so life becomes very difficult if I can't at least get a clean 6 hours of sleep.

***Other notes***

Our last win against Liverpool was in the Capital One Cup - but I've included the win in the PL as some might say its more significant

It's good to know we've beaten every team before now, lets hope we can beat the 6 teams we've never got a PL victory against
