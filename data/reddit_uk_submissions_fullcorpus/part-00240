Not sure how long I’m likely to stay given the way people have behaved here in the last 48 hours.

I’ve been a Chelsea supporter for a very long time, I’ve also been involved in a lot of online Chelsea-related endeavours. If this post comes across in any way patronising I’m sorry, but I don’t give a fuck.

What I see here is a lot of crying about what opposition fans think of us. Stop it. Stop it now and man up. Success breeds envy. It also breeds arrogance. So the next time someone’s winding you up, don’t feed them because you’ll probably just end up looking a massive dick by playing into their hands. Reason with them if you have the time and patience, but don’t expect a sensible reply. State your point and move on. They won’t acknowledge even if you’re right, they’ll slaughter you if you’re wrong. They’ll down vote you just because they can, but other people will see what you’ve written and if it’s right will take it on board. 

If you don’t know what you’re talking about, just shut up. There are plenty of people in /r/soccer who don’t know what they’re talking about. Just now it took me all of five minutes to correct three posts over there and I’m sure I could have spent days doing more. 

Know your club. Don’t fucking Google everything. If you’re one of the many who don’t really have a vested interest in Chelsea beyond watching them on TV or a stream once or twice a week, that’s fine, but you will at some point make yourself look stupid because all you have to talk about is what happened in that match, and only what the TV producers wanted you to see and hear. Sure, that might give you some insight into how we played, and certainly you’ll be able to quote formations and tactics, but you’re learning very little about Chelsea as a club and what it represents to many who have invested a vast amount of money in following them. Opposition fans can see right through that. Every single time.

Instead of looking for the next player you want to see at Chelsea on YouTube because Willian/Oscar/Cahill/Drogba had a bad day or run of form, try taking some time out to learn a little about the club. Only then might you begin to understand why occasionally people like me will turn aggressively on people claiming to be Chelsea fans. Buy some books, there are some exceptional books out there about Chelsea. If you’re at the Bridge one day, I might even introduce you to one of the authors. Read some of the excellent Chelsea blogs and other resources out there, you’d be amazed how much you can learn in the time it takes you to drink a coffee.

It felt to me, as if I was watching an explosion of multicoloured fireworks in the night sky made up of dying stars and galaxies. Suffice to say, it was amazing. But with the last few seasons I was becoming a bit disappointed. It feels like they're running out of ideas and reaching dead ends. With Gallifrey's apparent survival I think they're heading for closure to the series, though I don't blame them. It's been going on for over 50 years now. However as a fan it leaves me sad that it's going out with a low, instead of a high. Let me explain myself.

My first real sign of disappointment came with The God Complex. Maybe it's an unpopular opinion on my part but it just felt dry. People coming face to face with their fears who were in rooms in some crooked hotel or whatever while the whole place was run by some Minotaur thing... It was dry and out of the blue, a bit. It used to be that when they introduce a new villain they'd give them some backstory. Or at the very least, if they didn't, it's because they couldn't, though that didn't stop said villain from being a force to be reckoned with, and a fucked up one at that. I'm speaking about Midnight and the shadow entity. That was a beautiful episode and I loved it. The villain was something you could not convince, you couldn't feel pity for, you could only try to save yourself from it. And I think that a lot of the original DW episodes were about that as well. The Doctor using his cunning and wit to outsmart his enemies who were threatening not just the Earth, or a bunch of people or his friends but other worlds as well. Lately that's rare. Extremely. I know they did something like that recently with the Rings of Akhaten but frankly, I didn't like it. The setting was decent but I strongly disliked the girl actress. Mostly because I dislike child actors. I'm not sure if they're used to make you sympathise with them or pity them more but it's not working. It really isn't. But that's not as important. What I also disliked was the way the enemy, which was a parasitic soul-eating planet, which sounds cool on paper but was much less so in actuality.So anyways, first was the singing, and then the Doctor... shouting at it and making it overfeed on his lives. It felt cheap and didn't make me care nearly enough. Most recently, I was excited about Capaldi stepping in as it would remove some aspects of the old Doctor. Mainly, the Doctor flirting with his companions and pretty much everybody. And I was excited for the morbid distant change to his character. I know the Doctor is usually seen as a force of good and all but frankly, if I had to do all the shit he's done, for as long as he's done it, I'd more than else just go ""You know what? Fuck you all, let history take it's course, the Doctor out"". Of course that would destroy the whole episode, but maybe not necessarily. They could buff the enemies, making them more dangerous and focus on the Doctor trying to survive with his friend, maybe saving one or two people along the way, much like in Pompeii or the Waters of Mars. I wanted to see him become less of a hero and more of an anti-hero, chasing his own ambitions, in this case finding Gallifrey, than bothering with the universe's problems. And I think they're sort of going with that, but at the same time, it feels lacking. And let's not get me started on the last 2 Christmas specials. The Narnia rip-off one made me want to stab my brain out and  and the Inception rip-off made me stare blankly at the screen until the commercials after the credits showed up. If they had gone without the Santa, I would've accepted that, I would've even liked the psychological thriller aspect of it but making that setting and the enemies what they were and then just throwing in a sarcastic F-ing Santa Claus, it was just... hell no. Hell the F no. I will say one thing though. The Master coming back made me overjoyed. I was, truly happy as I myself was convinced he'd return. And I was pleasantly surprised that he returned in a female body. And was now smitten for the Doctor while his naturally psychopathic personality made her a bigger bitch and a much more hated character. All the while, still having that villainous charm. Basically, the Master was now a near perfect antagonist. I'm hoping there will be more of her, there probably will be, but I'm more than anything else hoping the show would get back the kick it used to have.

I know these are some strong opinions on my part but I'm open do discussion to see what the other members of the DW community think of them.

Edit: I've been made aware that this was more of a rambling tirade than a discussion prompt, so allow me to reiterate. I'd like to compare my views on Doctor Who as of late to those of others. For example, what they think of the series, the last 2-3 seasons, the recent Christmas and other specials, the Doctors, the companions, the villains, where it has come, where it could and will go, etc. Additionally, I'd love to hear theories on Doctor Who's possible future fates, plot- and character-wise. I'm well aware that my views are mostly subjective, though naturally it's hard to be objective about something you've grown to love or hate. And even harder when it's a form of art, if I could call it that. Lastly, I do apologise for my poor thought organisation skills, but in my defence, we are talking about Doctor Who and there is a lot to cover.",false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,null,null,self,Where Doctor Who is going (Discussion)(Possible spoilers?),0,http://www.reddit.com/r/doctorwho/comments/2yxj48/where_doctor_who_is_going_discussionpossible/

I have gotten a lot of the knowledge and love for the game due to him exposing me to the it since I was very young.

Anyway, he's not a Chelsea fan, he likes Real Madrid. But he does root for Chelsea since he knows I like them. He feels like we could benefit from a 4-1-4-1 formation in games like the PSG game, where we need to score. He says he feels Matic is so strong defensively that he could handle being lone holding role. And that playing Oscar and Fab in front of him, with Hazard and Cuadrado (he loves him since we are Colombian) on the wings should give us enough attacking power without leaving us too exposed to the counter. Makes sense to me and I like the idea. What do you guys think?

So, I am currently studying mathematics in Czech Republic (first year). I've been thinking about trying to get to Cambridge for my Master's degree (probably statistics). I noticed the Mathematics Graduate Study is just a 1-year course (here it's 2), and on the official website it says that it's meant as a stepping stone for PhD. Would you recommend trying to get to this course even if I don't plan on doing scientific research, but want to work in business (analysis and such) after I finish? I mean, I know how good Cambridge is overall, but studying something that may potentially not even be useful for the career path I want would obviously be pointless.


I know it's quite early for me to ask, but I'd like to have all the facts before I actually have to decide (and, obviously, try-hard my ass off for 3 years now).

We have fantastic wingers great at exposing the flanks, a strong middle of the pitch with Matic and Cesc, a solid backline, and an intense strike force. I think our biggest hole right now is our CAM. Bear with me here.

Oscar, in the past, has been what we needed. A jack of all trades player who does what we need when we need it. He tracks back, he adds a (somewhat limited) direct threat, and is rather quick on and off the ball. He is, however, showing his weaknesses lately. He is not a large, strong midfielder (although he plays strong for his size), not strong at picking out a killer final pass, nor can he shrug off any defensive midfielders/central defenders. 

However there is a player out there right now that, in my opinion, would be the final part of the Chelsea puzzle, and that is Pogba. He is strong, imposing, and a major direct threat. With him playing just off Costa, he will be able to create and finish much like he is doing at Juve but with a much stronger supporting cast behind him.

I understand he will demand a hefty fee, and that fee would most likely be the majority of a teams transfer budget in the summer, but I think we may be able to snag him. With a large sum of money offer, and a player swap with Oscar, I think we would be the favourites in the race. Oscar, being a smaller player, would thrive in Serie A. He would go from a supporting cast member that he is at Chelsea to a star player at a premier club in Italy. The league there is slower and not as physical, and I think Oscar would fit there excellent, as opposed to the EPL.

All in all, it wont happen, but I honestly think this swap would benefit both parties enormously. In the end, Real or Barca will offer and obscene amount of money and Juve will go that route, but Juve would have to go out and buy someone like Oscar anyway.

The difference between our performances in the first half of the season and now lies in intensity levels. During the first few games of the season we did not slow down or play games out after we got the lead. As the number of matches wore on &amp; our form picked up we started scoring goals faster &amp; just held on to the ball for long periods of time. As the games progressed we started spending more time holding on to a ball after killing a game than we spent attacking our opponents. In some games such as West Brom(H),which is where I think it all started, after 2 goals in the first 25mins we just sat back and didn't continue pressing like we did against Everton or Swansea. Basically what i'm trying to say is that we spent so much time passing the ball around after killing a game that the players seem to have forgotten what they used to do before they did that. The speed at which we passed the ball and the number of incisive passes we are making have reduced dramatically. All this time I was thinking that Fabregas has been out of form and as the main conductor our performances have not been the same because of that. The real reason is that the runs players are making and poor pressing out the front are to blame. I personally think that playing Willian in front of Fabregas with Ramires/Cuadrado on the right isn't working because of the lack of chemistry between Willian and Fabregas. Willian's work rate is higher than Oscar's(who is no slouch either) but the difference between the two lies in their understanding with Fabregas. When Oscar plays as the number 10 he knows exactly when Fabregas is going to move forward and drops back while Fabregas does the same when Oscar moves ahead. When Willian plays there we have a perfect block of 5 when defending but going forward Fabregas doesn't know when Willian will run forward or back so possibly out of fear of being caught out of position Fabregas chooses not to run too far beyond the center circle. Our lack of squad rotation from the beginning clearly seems to be leaving the players exhausted which does explain most of this. I hope we can rediscover that spark that led to us having the 8pt lead we have now and it helps us wrap up the league title soon.",false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,null,null,self,Comparison: First half of the season to now,11,http://www.reddit.com/r/chelseafc/comments/2yxwbb/comparison_first_half_of_the_season_to_now/

Converting sterling is always an option but that's gonna be hassle plus I'll be charging a fair bit of money to expenses down there and I'm allowed to use a personal card instead of the Amex meaning I could build up points/ cashback or whatever.

I've reached certain professional and monetary stability, and I think the time to start doing something with my savings has come. First of all, some background:

- I live in the UK at the moment, but I'm not sure for how long this will last, it might be 1 year or 10, it all depends on my job.

- I've never done any investment before, and my background is IT, nothing to do with economics or finance.

- I've saved over the last year and a half around £15K, money that is sitting in the bank not producing a lot!.

My idea is to start diving into this world a little bit, I do not pretend to quit my job and become a full time investor, I just want to be able to use my saved money wisely and hopefully get some decent profits out of it (at least more than the ridiculous % they give you in the bank!). I've been doing some research, and first of all I think I need to familiarise myself with basic concepts and terminology to be able to understand a little bit more about how all this thing works. Some good reading advise would be welcomed, I've been in the /r/investors and other subs, but most of them are focused on USA investments, and as long as I live in the UK -or in Europe for that matter- a book focused on UK/European investments makes more sense. I've found a few ones with good reviews in Amazon, for example these two:

http://www.amazon.co.uk/The-Financial-Times-Guide-Investing/dp/1292005076/ref=dp_ob_title_bk

http://www.amazon.co.uk/Guide-Exchange-Traded-Funds-Index-ebook/dp/B00AN4XVH2/ref=cm_cr_dp_asin_lnk

My idea, after gaining some basic knowledge, is to invest those £15k in a variety of things, not necessarily just in the stock market. A couple days ago, reading Wired I found a reference to this website, which does crowfunding equity stuff: 

https://www.seedrs.com

So that may be an option for a long term investment, then maybe some money in the stock market, and then I was thinking about investing a small amount of that money in high risk stuff.

As I said, I'm just a complete noob to this world, but the sooner I learn (I'm still under 30), the better for my future as a DIY investor.

Thoughts/suggestions/comments are welcomed!

Monthly mortgage payments are £450 and rental income is £800-£1000. The fixed rate deal will end on aug of this year. The questions I need advice on are.
Can I have the house revalued and can any increases in value be used to boost the LTV value and give me access to a better deal ?
If the property can be re valued this potential increase could give me access to interest only buy to let mortgages and could this be an avenue worth pursuing ?

I was dismissed for gross misconduct; what happened was I was having issues in my previous job with which policies applied to what people, confusion on certain policies that I felt weren't explained very well and difficulty getting this information in the first place, this lead to me making preventable mistakes. I was dismissed within the probation period.

Once I left the job I improved my CV and went on some courses which I felt benefited me and helped me land the job offer though I'm worried that what ever I type next is going to end up costing me the position. 

I feel like a right idiot for messing up in my previous role and I want this job badly so I would like to ask for a favour on how would you try to position this to an employer how and why you might have been dismissed.

**So as the title says here's the idea:**

Quite simply, it's a cross-pollinated community of creative individuals (from all twelve sectors) who love to share ideas, resources and come together to make good things happen at both a local and global scale. It’s to connect cities to individuals, private to public sector, unemployment to key skills and local issues to creative solutions. 

**When did it start?**

The journey began four weeks ago; we’re ran three events that popped up in local independent businesses in Liverpool - The Baltic Social being one of our favourites so far. 

**What are we trying to accomplish?**

Provide a platform for local and global cross-pollination 
A collaborative community of the twelve (DCMS defined) sectors of the creative industries.
*For example, what happens if an architect, a musician and a designer come together? Well, the recipes are endless.*

**Become the one-stop place for local resource**
Such as events, networking opportunities and creative information in each city - so, where ever you are, you’ll always be connected with what’s happening around you, where people meet and where you can go and see a band you’ve never heard of doing something completely experimental. We want to give a light to a beautiful culture.

**Build a large-scale directory of every creative individual on the globe**
It’s ambitious, we know. That’s everyone from employers to employees, from graduates to freelancers etc.
We want to encourage local businesses to recruit local creative individuals, but also to be aware of our creative community and it’s diversity. So, if you need a musician to cover an event or a school wants to run a voluntary code-club and struggling to find someone to contact? It’s a place where people can find creative people easily and where friendships are taken to a whole new level. 

**Host weekly niche-specific ‘clubs’ **
We want something happening every week. 
Whether we’re catering for students, low-income families and those unemployed to develop their knowledge and skill sets or advanced level conferences, we want to pull all the niche markets together to provide consistent entertainment and learning opportunities for everyone.  

**Work with the public sector to open communication**
We need to improve communication in areas such as academia and health. For example, colleges need to understand the requirements of digital businesses and students need an entry that goes beyond what their tutors can provide - by providing this platform we can open up the door for easy collaboration and communication between both the public and private sector. We could potentially revolutionise education in it’s entirety. 

**Bring together businesses, graduates and charities**
Every city has local issues - let’s try and use creative means to provide solutions or at minimum awareness. We’d like to have monthly hack days to tackle key topics for example, homelessness.

*A great example of this would be to bring together musicians to perform and raise awareness, designers and marketers to brand the event, developers to generate an easy donation application and fashion designers recreate unsaleable clothing donated to charity shops and offer free blankets and clothing to those in serious need. One small event could be enough to assist Whitechapel with their No Second Night Out campaign for an entire year. Our community isn’t just about creatives, it’s about everyone.*

Time seems to have stretched its wings since the last game, but it's the Whites who are flying after clinching all three points against Wigan! See what I did there? However, we're up against a team in fine fettle since Freedman took over, so taking all the points will be a very big ask today. Here's hoping that the lads at the very least put on a performance worthy of what's likely to be the largest home crowd of the season. Then again, from what I recall, that usually doesn't bode well. Another bad omen is that it looks like I'll be at the game too, which is why this post has been made so early! Now things can't possibly end well... or can they?

This thread is for predictions and pre-match discussion as part of the forum-wide prediction contest. Everyone is welcome to join, so feel to take part! All you need to do is make a clear scoreline prediction (e.g. 2-0 to Leeds); vague predictions (e.g. ""Leeds to win"" or ""it's going to end 1-0 or 0-0"") will not be counted.

Don't forget to check out the [February Predictions League Table](http://www.reddit.com/r/LeedsUnited/comments/2vs2n6/who_is_rleedsuniteds_best_predictor_predictions/) to see how things have been shaping up over the course of this competition! I'd also like to give a shout-out to grez1971's excellent [match preview](https://www.the-newshub.com/football/leeds-united-vs-nottingham-forest-game-preview), which is full of good, hype-building data that I don't have the time to find myself.

**My Prediction**

**2-2**

I think that we've got an exciting, high-scoring, and almost certainly nerve-wracking game on our hands. Forest are producing some great results as they look to gate crash the Play-Off party, but so are we as we desperately fight to make our season look less mediocre than it really has been. I really want to be optimistic, considering the way we've somehow been grinding out results lately, but I think that Forest will just have too much about them to leave empty-handed. I'll be more than happy if Leeds prove me wrong, though!",false,LeedsUnited,t5_2teb8,null,null,self,[Prediction Thread] Leeds United vs Nottingham Forest,11,http://www.reddit.com/r/LeedsUnited/comments/2yz67h/prediction_thread_leeds_united_vs_nottingham/

Thanks to all who advised and discussed the insurance process for this bike with me. I've opted to keep the YBR policy intact until it expires in May and apply the 12 months no claims on it to the CBF policy. The CBF policy at current is £120 fully comp a month, which I am told by the insurer will drop to £80 a month in May when I apply the NCB.

Rodgers: ""It's going to be very tight (race for top four). We've joined the race in past 3 months. We need to give everything.""

Rodgers: ""Swansea are a very good side. Been in top 10 all season. Garry [Monk] has done a great job. I had a wonderful time there.""

Rodgers: ""Garry has dealt with the job very well. He will go on to become an outstanding manager.""

Rodgers: ""Nothing new to report on Sterling deal. I'm relaxed about it. He still has a couple of years to run. He loves being here.""

Rodgers: ""Raheem said himself recently that this is the best club for a young player to develop.""

Rodgers: ""Swansea will beat that tally (of 47pts). That will be great for Garry and great for the club - it shows they're progressing.""

Rodgers: ""We are re-energised and refreshed. We feel we can push on in terms of our level of performance.""

Rodgers: ""If you look at our record last year away from home it was very good. You have to have character to win away from home. The space opens up a lot more and we have great counter attack speed and players who are gifted technically. We respect it will be tough at Swansea.""

Rodgers: ""Our training sessions now don't need to be as long as the players have a good level of fitness. More explosive work now.""

Rodgers: ""I always try to win with best sporting behaviour you can have. I call it respect. There is a line I'd never want my team to cross""

TIA - This is Anfield

Rodgers: Skrtel should be fine for Monday.

Rodgers: Joe Allen back fit and well.

Rodgers on top four: It's going to be very tight. We've re-joined the race in last 3 months. We're looking forward to remaining games.

Rodgers on Sterling's contract: There's nothing new to report on it. I'm quite relaxed about Raheem's situation... he's not going anywhere in a hurry.

Rodgers on Sterling: He's made it clear himself that he loves being here and I think he was quoted for any young player to be here.

Rodgers: Our last performance vs. Blackburn was at the end of a really tough period of games. We were low [on energy, stats show].

Rodgers asked more on Sterling, why hasn't he accepted ""incredible"" offer: I'm not sure.

Rodgers also asked about Henderson contract situation. Says it's between the club and the player's representatives.

Rodgers says Henderson and Sterling are good at separating the business side from the football side (with regards contracts).

Rodgers asked about player's discipline: There's a line of behaviour that I'll never ask my teams to cross.

I've had a look at a couple of firms in China that have come back cheaper, but the saving is wiped out by postage, but if anyone knows of a good Chinese company with cheap postage that'd be awesome too...

I have a bit of strange question about mortgage affordability checks...

I have a DIP for a mortgage but I'm not happy with the rate/amount offered.

A major factor of this decision was down to a loan I pay each month £336 for 18 months - just over £6k remaining) which is a big chunk of my take home pay (£2100/mo).

I have recently been offered a 0% money transfer through one of my credit cards so my question is:

If I were to transfer the outstanding loan amount to this card (the savings are minimal ~£45 saved after fees) would this go in my favour in terms of mortgage affordability as the £336/mo payment would be abolished but instead I would have £6k on a card or would it do the opposite and hinder me loading up £6k on a card (no other balances)?

(Note: I would be paying the £336/mo to the card instead so it would be cleared in the same amount of time as the current loan)

Any help appreciated!

But i have noticed that alot of our players (especially new signings) have started off brilliantly (better than that even) and then proceeded to hit quite large drops in form. Perfect examples are Tadic, Pelle and Elia. All hit the ground running and looked to take the prem by storm but then have seemed to lose their form. Elia had that united game where he was the difference but since he hasn't done much that was noticeable, same goes for his skills, he seems to have lost all those amazing touches he was doing in the first 3 or 4 games. Then Djuricic had what i thought was a really impressive debut even though we lost but again now doesnt seem as on the ball. Same could also be said for JWP although he did come back from injury. Anyway i just wondered if anyone could think of reasons why. I'm not being dramatic but for some of our players it almost feels like their talents declined since signing for us and i'm not just talking about the recent lack of goals but more about the whole game, the passes, the runs, the synchronization of the team in general. :)",false,SaintsFC,t5_2tboa,null,null,self,Is it just me or do our players seem to have misrepresented themselves??,2,http://www.reddit.com/r/SaintsFC/comments/2z0hup/is_it_just_me_or_do_our_players_seem_to_have/

&gt; What’s missing at a club like Real Madrid at the moment?

&gt; The only thing I can see from outside is that there is a hole in the squad. They have a group of stars and they have a group of young boys who are not ready to cope with that pressure and that quality. What is missing is what I call low-profile players. For example, in my team I love to have Geremi on the bench because he’s a low-profile player who is ready to help, ready to fight for the team, ready to do the job I want him to do. If I need him to play right-back, he can play right-back. If I need him to play right-winger, he can play right-winger. If I need him to pick up a man and mark him out of the game, he does it. 

&gt; And you look to Milan, it’s the same story. You have the main XI, but after that you can find Ambrosini, you know Kaladze is there,
and Tomasson too. They have a group of second-line players to give support.

&gt; You go to Real Madrid and you find lots of attacking stars – Owen, Ronaldo, Morientes, Raul and so on – and after that you have two central defenders, you have only Michel Salgado for the right-hand side, you have only Helguera for the defensive midfield player and you don’t feel that is right for the whole season. That’s easy to see from the outside. What I can’t answer is – are they committed? Do they have enough motivation? Do they think football all the time or are they training but thinking about something they have to do after lunch? You can only find out by working with them.


Personally, it's a an interesting quote that reveals the dichotomy between the thinking of many fans - myself included at times - and Mourinho's, during a period when there's a lot of talk of trying to assemble a squad chock full of world class players.

I was reading about the courses structure and each module but I don't really understand it, how are you assessed? 

-Essays [about what? how much essays are expected? how much does it weight toward the grade?]
-Practical [as in......? % toward the grade?] 
-Exams [about what and on what? % toward the grade?]

Would essays and practical be classified as coursework i.e. something I can do/prepare for outside of class?

I hear the course is more academic, what does this mean is it just there’s more written stuff? I’m severely dyslexic, so the idea really scares me. I’m fine if I can do the work outside of class. 

Do you know how lenient the Uni is with grades [ABB needed what if I get AAC or ABC?]

What do you think makes graphics at Leeds different from other unis?

What do you like/dislike about the course? 

Am going to the open day on the 18th, what are the important stuff/questions should I ask.

Sunderland have drawn more often against Villa than versus any other opponent in their Premier League history (11 times).

[](//#whistle) And we're off!

**11'**  Great play involving the whole side as a Charlie Taylor effort is saved well by Darlow. Mowatt instrumental in that move.

**14'** Good defending by Bellusci to block an effort from Chris Burke after the winger made his way into the area.

**22'** Chance for Forest as they break at pace down the right, ball played across the edge of the box for Osborn but Silvestri saves his effort.

**25'** Half-chance as an Alex Mowatt free-kick is headed wide by Steve Morison.

**28'** Good save from Silvestri as Osborn pokes an Antonio cross goalwards. The keeper gets down well to make the save.

**35'** A cheeky little flick at the front post from Lewis Cook after a Luke Murphy corner almost catches Forest out, but it's blocked.

**43'** Cook goes down under a challenge from Lichaj inside Forest's box.
 
**45'** [](//#whistle) Half-time. Leeds the better team.

---------------------
 
**Half-time:** Leeds United 0 - 0 Notts Forest

---------------------

[](//#whistle) Second-half started!

**50'** [](//#yellow) Bellusci booked for a foul on Blackstock

**52'** Almost a great chance for Billy Sharp after a flick on from Steve Morison but the Forest defence just get to the ball first.

**59'** Charlie Taylor shoots for goal from distance but his effort goes over the crossbar.

**66'** [](//#yellow) Booking for Steve Morison.

**68'** [](//#sub) Sub for Leeds. [](//#down) Morison off, [](//#up) Antenucci on.

**72'** Chance for Forest as Lichaj shoots from distance. The ball bounces just infront of Silvestri but he makes the save.

**73'** Silvestri makes a great save to deny Chris Burke after he cut inside the area to make the space to shoot.

**77'** [](//#yellow) Alex Mowatt booked

**79'** [](//#sub) Sub for Leeds. [](//#down) C Taylor off, [](//#up) Doukara on.

**81'** Good play from Mowatt and Antenucci open up the Forest defence but Mirco's final touch is too heavy and the ball runs behind.

**84'** [](//#yellow) Luke Murphy booked

**90'** Four added minutes.

**90+4'** Forest get a bullshit free-kick on the edge of the box...Lansbury takes and curls it over the bar. 

**90+4'** Game ends. Well that was boring.

In a thrilling game, the Hammers were held to draw against the Seagulls, with both teams having plenty of chances.

Coach Mark Phillips was without key players such as Emmanuel Onariase (on the first-team bench today), Reece Oxford, Decarrey Sheriff and Kyle Knoyle.

Into the team came Norwegian attacking midfielder and trialist Martin Samuelsen, from Manchester City. The defence was comprised of three U16s and an U18 - with the schoolboys being Vashon Neufville, Tunji Akinola, and Declan Rice.

After the game, it was confirmed that Manchester City’s Samuelsen was offered a six-week trial at the club. The 17 year old attacking midfielder is unlikely to be offered a professional deal, however.

Allergic missed the last game. Allergic is slacking. Allergic apologises. Allergic moves on.

As some of you may be aware controversy (drama!) hit Predict for Gold a couple of weeks back but that's all behind us now. **Please guys, please, read the goddamn rules.**

6 months worth in the pot! Game is on Monday. You know what to do.

Please upvote for visibility so that everyone can get involved. We're all friends here. I don't get any karma for this!

Best of luck,

Allergic
________________________


Please leave a comment below stating your prediction for the upcoming game. I need from you:

&gt;**(1) The Full time score (CLEARLY stating the winner; irrelevant if you think it'll be a draw)** 

&gt;**(2) The First goalscorer (irrelevant if you think it's a 0-0er)**

And the answer to the tiebreak:

&gt;**(3) The minute in which the first goal is scored.**

______________________________________________________
**Gold Pot:** 6 Months
_______________________________________________________

**Rules:**

* Victor will win the amount of Reddit Gold in the 'Gold Pot'
* If a contestant has guessed the first goalscorer and full time score correctly, they must PM me after the 90 mins are up to ensure valid entry. This PM must contain proof that they are an active /r/Liverpoolfc user.
* If you think the first goal scored will be an own goal, just write own goal and the minute. You do not need to say which team or player has scored it. 
* If two or more people have the same CORRECT predictions for the game, the winner will be the person closest with their tiebreak answer. 
* If there is no clear winner (no one guesses right or two or more entrants have the same prediction and result to the tiebreak question, the gold will be added to the 'gold pot' carry over to the following week)
* If more there's more than one correct guess of 0-0 the winner will be picked at random
* One entry per person
* Entry shuts an hour before kick off
* Entrants accounts must be older than 3 months
* No obviously edited answers (when the * appears)
* These posts will hopefully be weekly (funds permitting), but will not be posted at the same time each week to hopefully catch only /r/Liverpoolfc lurkers.
* This is obviously in it's infancy so there will be teething problems, please be patient with me.

* The Hammers did the double over the Gunners in the 2006-07 season but since then are winless in 14 league and cup games (D2, L12) against them.

**Arsenal**

* The Gunners have won 11 of 13 games since New Year's Day, including seven wins from eight league matches.
* They have claimed 21 Premier League points in 2015 - only Liverpool, with 23, have a better record.
* Arsenal have won seven consecutive home league games - they have not won eight in a row since a 13-match streak in 2005.
* Olivier Giroud has scored four goals in four games against West Ham, while Theo Walcott has netted five times in his last four matches against the Hammers.
* Francis Coquelin has made 41 Premier League interceptions since returning from a loan spell with Charlton in December - more than any other player in the same period.

**West Ham United**

* The Hammers are winless in their last seven league and cup games (D3, L4).
* They have recorded just one victory in 11 Premier League games since Christmas Day (D5, L5).
* Sam Allardyce has yet to win a Premier League game away to Arsenal in his managerial career, losing seven and drawing three of 10 games.
* They have kept one Premier League clean sheet away from home this term - against Southampton last month. It is the joint-lowest total in the top flight along with Burnley and QPR.

In a thrilling game, the Hammers were held to draw against the Seagulls, with both teams having plenty of chances.

Coach Mark Phillips was without key players such as Emmanuel Onariase (on the first-team bench today), Reece Oxford, Decarrey Sheriff, Kieran Bailey and Kyle Knoyle.

Into the team came Norwegian attacking midfielder and trialist Martin Samuelsen, from Manchester City. The defence was comprised of three U16s and an U18 - with the schoolboys being Vashon Neufville, Tunji Akinola, and Declan Rice.

After the game, it was confirmed that Manchester City’s Samuelsen was offered a six-week trial at the club. The 17 year old attacking midfielder is unlikely to be offered a professional deal, however.

West Ham United U18s: Sam Howes, Vashon Neufville, Tunji Akinola, Declan Rice, Alex Pike, Joe Powell, Matt Carter, Noha Sylvestre, Martin Samuelsen, Grady Diangana (Oscar Borg 59), Jahmal Hector-Ingram

I was looking at Cambridge but I guess misread and I thought they had online courses for IGCEs and you can complete them in a little over a month and then take the IGCEs. But I was doing some more research and the courses are aimed at teachers and the actual courses take 2 years. 

I'm really lost and I can't turn up clear searches on this topic, can anyone help me?

**THE TEAMS:**

*RICH GANG*

Kundral, Gator, Spoofs, MINECRAFTMAN2002, Welp

Rich Gang are so confident that they will dominate this upcoming LAN that during practice they even let Meep draft 'just to see if they could still win' and during one scrim deliberately let Welp play carry. Meanwhile it's been rumored the team has also considered switching roles, namely such that Kundral became 'the underage meme spouter' and Meep became 'the one who values a person's worth only by their MMR', but decided to stick with the status quo. Likewise, Gator will remain as 'the guy who can only type ""lmao""' and Welp will reprise his role as 'the guy who manages to shitpost with every word he says and types'. The only real question is which of the top two finishing spots they will occupy.

*ICHIGOGOGO*

1chigo, watsons_water, Soodle, Mute242, Lnfernokoi

Wong and co. will be hoping to continue their success as one of the two teams in the country who aren't shit. Multi talented Mute242 makes an appearance on this team after winning last LAN by playing mid. Fans may be ecstatic to learn he will be playing support again, however apprehensive due to the fact that Rime isn't drafting and so Mute242 may get to play other heroes than Vengeful Spirit. Further outrage has occurred due to the fact that fellow LAN winner Lnfernokoi has been seen playing Vengeful Spirit instead.

*CHOKE GAMING*

DOOPZ, NepaLii_Jesus, LoG_Reeper, Dae, Logarhythythyryrhrythmic

After acquiring their new sponsorship, Jesus+4 are desperate to remove all things that would give DOOPZ a reason to be pissed off, and have been working hard on being the least shit of all the teams without members of Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson. Despite rumours that LoG_Reeper had taken a permanent place in DreadKnight's team after playing a spectacular initiating role for the team last LAN, the full 5 man squad is back to be the only team to pick heroes such as Techies at a fucking LAN. A team of many firsts, they are also the only team to send one of their players all the way to Hong Kong to play on Chinese servers to improve just for a UK LAN. Although NepaLii is in China, the team assured me that NepaLii_Jesus WILL be playing for the team at LAN, although this post was written over an hour ago and things have probably changed by now.

*DREAD'S TEAM (JOHN SMEDLEY?)*

Groanors, Kappacino, Antab, DreadKnight, Shoe

The team with the most top heavy net worth distribution [R]eturn for another LAN having notoriously won the last LAN only due to a mix of corruption, and a conveniently pushed back flight for Gronors. The team's plan to lose two games and then take the last two worked a treat, and as a result two of this team's players go into this LAN being last LAN's winners. Meanwhile Antab must be pleased to play for a team of an average MMR more than 2000.

*WAOW GAMING*

Dai, Raiderbee, Korben Dallas, Pomfis, SimSim

Gator and Monhay notably left the team after last LAN, which led Dai to have a mental breakdown and try to integrate his team into the community as a meme about as despondent and forced as one of Korben Dallas' Antimage builds. Regardless the team is looking to get back on track, feeling renewed with a new team motto ""You don't have to be good to play here...but it helps!"". After attaining third last LAN, the consensus is that many don't think this team will go particularly far this LAN after losing their star mid player. At present, the dubious strategy appears to be that Raiderbee will prevent the rest of his team from being first blood at all costs, while the carry player will be oblivious to mainly everything including the fact that his boots change colour until, at about 40 minutes, he dies to such an underwhelming gank that the casters will probably ignore it leaving fans to speculate if he was smoke ganked or had an aneurysm due to an episode of PTSD from his 1v1 with Shoe. Just to add to their woes, Dai's life is being made harder by Gator who keeps sending him pictures of things that are on average more farmed than Korben Dallas, such as the fields of Namibia.

*RASTA A OWL*

MontSta, Snubs, Sagea, Spaaada, nox_legend

Rasta could be in good shape to challenge for the top places this LAN that aren't taken by Rich Gang, 1chigo, Choke, WAOW or Dread's team.

*NO FLAMEBOY 2012*

Monhay, Tenali, Genoooo, Zealos, Flameboy

The team ~~that now finally lives up to its name~~ has acquired Zealos after returning from the dead now that Monhay has left WAOW Gaming. Noble efforts to be had from this team, who are looking to lead by example in being true advocates of the concept that UKDota is not good.

*DREAD'S CORNER SHOP CREW*

Soup, Fuzzy, Kaneo (Hunter), Decco, Caspah

Obscene esports did well to secure a top 6 placement last LAN after being exhausted, deprived of their energy drinks. The team has since dissolved, leaving support player Soup to convene with Kaneo and Fuzzy for now. Something something Kaneo something something vomit something towel.

EDIT: I have been informed Decco, and star core player and IHL fiend Caspah are playing for the team! Needless to say if you give this man from Essex a solo lane he will bring the pain.

*PROTEIN, STEROIDS, AND SEX MOVES*

Some players

The team that mysteriously takes Kundral's life in a nutshell as their namesake could entertain us this LAN.

**THE CASTERS:**

I hope I can speak for ALL of us when I say I am certainly pleased that we have ODPixel and Rusts casting this LAN and absolutely not Gareth ""Durka"" ""2k MMR"" ""Satan"" Bateson. ODPixel's game knowledge completely blows Durka's out of the water and personally I am looking forward to a cast filled with fun memes and Dominoes pizza.

Anywho watched some youtube videos, bought a paddock, grunge brush and some of this stuff
[spray](http://www.sportsbikeshop.co.uk/motorcycle_parts/content_prod/22977)
Scrubbed chain after soaking it in the cleaner, used grunge brush, used the cleaner on sprockets a bit. At this point I kept using a clean rag to get dirt off, but it would not get clean, 30 minutes of scrubbing and was still black each wipe of chain. So let it dry then lubed it up, made sure I coated it everywhere then put some on sprocket at chain area carefully.

Chain looks better but still orange in places, sprockets seem fine.

Questions..

- Did I get the general idea right with what I did?


- My rear brakes seems to scrape when I turn the wheel should I be worried? (Front breaks similar although not as bad. This was happening before i did maintenance)

- Should I be worried about bits of orange rust? Should I clean again?

- Engine sometimes pops which it never used to when I bought it?


Appreciate any guidance. Thanks

I've been lurking here for ages, don't have a bike yet, but I'm working towards it.
I have been looking at all the options to get to a licence and trying to see what bike will fit my (limited) budget. Most of this has been going back and forth from ads and auto trader to wikipedia and other sites to find out more. Information is spread all over the place and for a noob it is hard to tell the differences (cb500 for example, confuses me allot). Wikipedia has some good info but it's more of a brief history that sometimes has specs for the latest model.

I was hoping some of you who own bikes could take a few minutes on these rainy days and see if you can add anything. If you own or have been into motorcycling for a while, you know what's changed and its significance.
hings like  
*Basic Specs  
*Variations year to year  
*Major model refreshes  
*Differences from various refreshes  
*Pictures of your bike  
*Features, standard and optional extras  
*Licence required to ride in uk  

I have seen some bike review sites have this info, but much is from release and not updated.
This could then make it easy to point people to, knowing their questions will be answered.
If there is somewhere this exists, or this is too cheeky, sorry and please let me know. Any info is better than none at all.  
Thanks

I'm not talking specifics, but there are a few glaring needs in my estimation.

1) If Sam is the manager, then he needs to find alternate ways to play with the players we have. We signed some good players last summer, but the rest of the league knows who they are and what they can d now. To avoid a sophomore slump for these players, they need new tools to be successful. If he isn't, then we need someone who comes ready made to optimize the talent we have up front. I've no clue who that could be,


2) We need a top level CB, someone who is a starter, not a back up to the 3 we have. Two of the 3 we have need to be backups, and until he works his way up the seeding ladder, Henry needs to be the 5th back.


3) We need to secure our fb's and have proper backup on each side.


4) We need speed in midfield in the center. Nolan, Noble and Song haven't got it, and as industrious as they are, at least one of them needs to have more pace and quickness. Without it we can't effectively disrupt play in the center of the park nor can we put sides under enough pressure when we push forward.


5) At least one more all around winger who has pace. Jarvis (who did have a decent match today) is not of standard, and Amalfitano is properly designated as a back up option. Another good winger lets us keep Downing in the center.


6) Our fitness is shit poor. We can't play in the last 20 minutes of the match. This has to change and change drastically. How many goals have we given up in the last 15 minutes of play this year?


7) We need a poacher, a goal scorer. I love Enner, and Diaffra and even AC on his day, but when the season gets long in the tooth and the injuries start to pile up, so too do the goals.


That's just a stream of conscience off the top of my head start of a list. What else do you lot think?

I am a PhD student in the UK. In addition to my EPSRC stipend (£1143 per month, which is tax free and does not count towards my Personal Allowance) I also receive £540 per month from my family.

I share an apartment with my girlfriend. The rent is £660 per month. When we signed the contract, I was made the lead tenant. My girlfriend transfers £330 per month to me so that the full £660 is drawn from my account. She also contributes £50 per month towards bills.

Does the £540 and £380 per month count towards my Personal Allowance?  Or is the £540 classified as a gift and the £330 classified as rent from a lodger (or perhaps a gift?) so neither counts towards my Personal Allowance?",false,UKPersonalFinance,t5_2wkka,null,null,self,Personal Allowance - Rent,5,http://www.reddit.com/r/UKPersonalFinance/comments/2z1oty/personal_allowance_rent/

For Shaktar he played in CAM and was brilliant for them in that position. A perfect blend of pace, close control, creativity and a good shot.

Whenever Willian has played CAM for us he has played pretty well. The game where we had a front 4 of 

Cudrado Willian Hazard
             Remy( I think)

stuck in my memory because of Willian's brilliant performance. He carried the ball and drove at the opposition defense with confidence, just bursting blast players with pace. Got off a couple of goods shots and made some nice passes but still for all he did his end product was still left lacking. Another example of a match where Willian played well in CAM was the stoke fixture at home last season where I think he scored the winner.

Oscar has been in a bit of a slump recently and I think now is the time to play Willian through the middle to create some competition for that position and to bring ou th best in the two players. This would also allow Cuadrado to play right wing who would provide our creative players another option as he frequently makes runs in behind the defence.

Bacuna was outstanding as a right wingback, and had the freedom to get in attacking third positions regularly. Looks to be a real threat in this role, and I can't even imagine him in midfield at this point.

Lately I've been thinking about studying in Britain, more specificially I'd like to study medical biochemistry, and being a little bit thick I've become confused in regards to your grading system.

As I've come to understand it, I should try to convert my (Swedish) grades into A-levels and then try to apply with those. However, our school systems seem to differ quite a lot. When I did my equivalent of your secondary school, I got grades in about 20 different subjects, but as I've understood it, you only study like 4-5 at this level in the UK? I'm therefore not sure whether or not the universities want an average of all my grades (as is the case when you apply to uni here), or if they are looking for grades in a specific subject. 

This is what the university I wish to apply for writes about entry requirements:
""AAB Typical offer
Specific subjects/grades required for entry:
Chemistry.

General information on subjects/grades required for entry:
Chemistry plus one from Biology or Human Biology, Computer Science, Environmental Studies, Geography, Geology, ICT, Mathematics, PE, Physics, Psychology or Sports Science.""

Does this mean they are only looking for my grades in Chemistry plus one more from the other subjects listed, or do I need an AAB average plus having studied chemistry+ one other subject from the list? If the former option is the case it would be sweet, since I've the highest possible grades in chemistry, biology and biochemistry, and I suppose those would be converted to AAA or something similar. I think I could talk to my old school about how I get my grades in english, I'd just like to know if they are searching for a specific grade or an average of all grades.

Hopefully this is not too dumb of a question, and someone could help me out with my troubles. :)",false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,null,null,default,Confused about required grades,0,http://www.reddit.com/r/AskUK/comments/2z24uh/confused_about_required_grades/

We probably won't win the title and offensively, we were pretty terrible that game, but here's what I think were the positives from the match:

-Defensively, we were very good. The goal was unfortunate, but Kompany and Zabaleta both had great matches. Demi and Clichy looked a bit more shaky, but it seemed like Burnley liked attacking from the left side, so that may be why. Fernandinho was also great defensively and Toure looked more energetic than usual in defense, in my opinion. Emphasis on the **defense**.

-I still hate Boyd. That's a positive, I think. That guy spit on one of our players the last time, scored an offside goal, and now this. Hatred maintained.

-Hmmmm...

That's all I got. You guys?

-No meaningful shots on target (Some people can see the positives in anything)

-Higher chance of Pellegrini getting sacked

-Silva and Yaya rested because they were subbed off early

And when that happened I saw the same arguement I am seeing today 'he won't get sacked based on his success last season. We've seen before, that winning the title last season means nothing in the next season. United ran away with the title and we lost the fa cup final. This season we are seeing chelsea run away with the title and 2nd place isn't even secured yet. We got knocked out of both domestic cups very early on in the campaign (something the board won't be happy with). Sure he got further in Europe than Mancini ever did but based on the new pooling system where you are put in pots based on where you finished in your own domestic league. And have the risk of dropping to third will put us in risk of anthor group of death. So results wise Mancini and Pelligreni are similar in the level of results they are obtaining. Now the other argument I'm seeing as to why Mancini got sacked and Pelligreni won't is the dressing room dismay that Mancini caused. However the dressing room isn't exactly perfect at the moment is it. The players all seem to lack motivation and there are reports (even though the players have come out and said that the reposts are false.) of fighting. And as another person said the other day 'there is no smoke without fire'. So is Pellegrini as good as gone? I think the only way he has a change of keeping the city job he will need to come up big against Barca mid week cause if he loses again in Spain the board will be quickly looking for a replacement. x",false,MCFC,t5_2s14k,null,null,self,Pelligreni getting sacked?,1,http://www.reddit.com/r/MCFC/comments/2z2oje/pelligreni_getting_sacked/

When I was a kid I remember when we lost 6-0 against QPR. It felt like Kevin Miller let those goals in which was pretty heartbreaking for a child to see. In fact, most of my childhood watching Palace has fluctuated from big highs and big lows. I was at the Millennium stadium when we were promoted in 2004/05 and I was at Charlton when we were relegated.

Now, all these years of highs and lows (and lets be honest, mostly lows) the commitment is really starting to pay off. I don't think I've ever felt this good supporting Palace.

The season we were promoted was incredible. Bolasie, Zaha and Murray were 3 of the best attacking players in the league. We beat Brighton in the play off semi-final in their own stadium. We won the play offs when no one expected us to.

Then Tony Pulis saved our season, which I will always be thankful for. However it's clear he fucking loves Stoke, and this was probably the only top flight team that would have him because his reputation was playing shit football and making shit signings. His season was like a one night stand, we both benefitted for the short term but it was never going to last.

However we made Luis Suarez cry and we ended Chelsea's chance for the title.

Warnock never happened.

We now have a manager who cares about the club. Referencing Steve Coppell in his post-match interview says it all. We're playing better football than under Pulis. Playing Puncheon through the middle is genius. Wilf is back home and has the hunger to succeed. James McArthur is incredible. Scott Dann is incredible and should be playing for England. Martin Kelly is playing well. Delaney has adapted to the Premier League. Murray is showing his worth again. We have a great squad with depth.

I worry about the takeover and I know everything will probably go to shit some time, because we're Palace. 

Savour the moment. We're very nearly safe, and I hopefully we have more years where we're competitive and not constantly fearing relegation.",false,crystalpalace,t5_2tqdj,null,null,default,Have we ever had it so good?,1,http://www.reddit.com/r/crystalpalace/comments/2z2u7a/have_we_ever_had_it_so_good/

All of our loanees will return leaving us with a core of players who took us up in the Championship.

Phillips-------Henry---------Barton---Traore/Hoilett

---Grego-Cox/Petrasso---Some Player from Eredivise ;)

Subs: Faurlin, Doughty, Robinson, Kpekwa, Ehmer

I'm not too sure that Zamora will still be with us due to retirement age. I think Dunne still has another 5 seasons with him, especially at Championship level. 

I would like to see Caulker and Fer loaned out, but i don't think that should be necessary unless we miraculously go straight back up. In terms of the subs, i don't know enough about our youth to be too decisive. I think we should try to offload Hoilett, just because i find him a bit of a waste of space. Honestly i think this would be a pretty decent starting 11, especially if the 6'8"" player we pick up from the Eredevisie is decent. 

Should be another interesting year for r/superhoops.

I'm assuming it had a small budget but it was extremely well filmed and acted. Aside from O'Connell there's Paul Anderson aka Peaky Blinders' Arthur Shelby and one guy I recognized from The Pacific but couldn't remember his name.

I'm curious as to what the reception to it has been like in NI. There's not much buzz about it here in the States but the theater I saw it in was near full. Has anyone else seen it/what did you think?

On Friday March 15 1985, 30 years ago today, the song 'Doctor In Distress' was unleashed on the world. The song can be found on Youtube [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnTSbFeWwro).

To start with, here is the Watcher's Column from Doctor Who Magazine #445, where the author tackles Doctor In Distress.

""Few jewels in *Doctor Who's* diadem of derangement twinkle more beguilingly than *Doctor In Distress,* 1985's appalling pound-shop simulacrum of the original Band Aid single which, at the time, was a mere three months old and had only just dropped out of the UK chart. Whatever else you might think of *Do They Know It's Christmas?,* it undeniably changed the face of pop music, saved thousands of lives, and played a significant role in the politicizing of a generation. It was into this crackling thundercloud of turbo-charged possibility that a slightly less feted charity supergroup came waddling: a band with the staggeringly ill-advised name of Who Cares.

With its all-star cast, its one-line-each divvying-up of the lyrics, its melodically near-identical singalong chorus, and its low-tech video capturing the vocalists grinning at each other from beneath their studio headphones, *Doctor In Distress* shamelessly aped the Band Aid single beat for beat - except in one crucial respect. Its heroic mission was not to feed the world, but to hasten the return of a TV show by a few months. *What were they thinking?* Never mind the grimness of the tune, the tinny cheapness of the production, the breathtaking vocal stylings of Anthony Ainley and Nicola Bryant, or the inexplicable willingness of members of Ultravox and The Moody Blues to get involved in such a car-crash; you could write a whole book just on the shockingly poor taste.

But let other pens dwell on guilt and misery: I'd rather talk about the lyrics. Each and every line is an unconsidered masterpiece of lunacy. Take a moment, for example, to consider the contention that *'There was a police box in a junkyard - we didn't know where it would go.'* Hmm. Surely the crucial proposition is that we didn't know that it *could* go. At all. It was, after all, a police box in a junkyard. That was kind of the point.

The second verse finds *Doctor in Distress* treading on eggshells as it enters the blissful realm of the non-copyright-infringing lyric. This isn't a BBC-endorsed record - far from it - so there can be no Daleks, no Cybermen, no Ice Warriors. Instead we get *'evil metal creatures', 'cybernetic humans'* and *'warriors of the ice'.* But it's in the third and final verse that our loopy lyricist really spreads his wings and takes flight into la-la land. First out of the gate is the knuckle-crushing, sphincter-clenching, spleen-twitching, cold-hearted, dead-eyed fanboy obsessiveness of the line *'We've learned to accept six Doctors'.* Oh, that speaks volumes. We haven't 'marvelled at', or 'cheered on', or 'fallen in love with' six Doctors. No, no, no, no, no. We've 'learned to accept' them. (With hindsight it's a line rendered even more unfortunate by the fact that it wouldn't be long before we discovered that the BBC's drama bosses had only really learned to accept five Doctors, but that's another story.)

Next up is the blatant untruth *'When they were faced with danger, they didn't run, they didn't hide.'* What are you talking about? Of course they flaming well did. Do you want a list? Then, following another spot of studious copyright-dodging (*'a canine computer'* - clever), we ascend the final devastating peak of *'Each screaming girl just hoped that a Yeti wouldn't shoot her.'* Where to begin? Perhaps with the observation that, as far as I can recall, only one *Doctor Who* girl ever encountered the (non-copyright, so we can say the word) Yeti and that, contrary to popular belief, she never really screamed all that much until required to do so by the plot of *Fury from the Deep.* Prior to that story, Victoria specialised instead in a sort of muffled whooping yelp. Furthermore, the Yeti only shoot people in Episodes 2-6 of *The Web of Fear,* and even then I'm struggling to think of a scene in which Victoria specifically hopes that she won't be the victim. So, in summary, the lyric would be altogether more accurate if it went something like *'One yelping girl possibly hoped, during five particular episodes in 1968, that a Yeti wouldn't shoot her.'*

In fact, *Doctor in Distress* plays so fast and loose with reality that you'd be forgiven for refusing to accept even its seemingly innocuous opening gambit at face value. So, in the interests of accuracy, I have just contacted the Met Office Archives - no, really, I have - and it turns out that there's good news and bad news. There were scattered showers across much of the UK on 23 November 1963, but it was unusually mild for that time of the year.

**IN A NUTSHELL:** It was a warm, showery night in November, 49 years ago.""

Here are a few additional facts about Doctor In Distress:

- The song was a charity song for Cancer Research, now Cancer Research UK, and all of the profit generated from the single would be donated to the Charity. The song did not even chart in the UK. Apparently, less than a thousand copies of the song were sold, and thousands of copies had to be melted down. Because the song didn't sell well, there was no profit made, so no money was given to Cancer Research. Ian Levine currently owns the right to the song. More information can be found [here](http://www.millenniumeffect.co.uk/audio/tributes) and clicking on 'Doctor In Distress'. If that doesn't work, use this image link: http://imgur.com/mwWtnnx, or this one for a full screen view: http://i.imgur.com/mwWtnnx.png.

- The song was so bad that the BBC refused to broadcast it on the radio.

- Hans Zimmer, the famous film score composer, was the one who played the synthesizer in this song.

- Ian Levine, one of the writers and producers of the song, stated that ""It was an absolute balls-up fiasco. It was pathetic and bad and stupid. It tried to tell the Doctor Who history in an awful high-energy song. It almost ruined me.""

I had planned to include a link to buy the song, but I couldn't find it anywhere on iTunes or Spotify from Google (I don't have accounts with either of them), so here is a link to the donation page for Cancer Research UK, if you want to make a donation that way: http://www.cancerresearchuk.org/support-us/donate.

So, that was a summary of an infamous, but entertaining chapter in Doctor Who's history. I'll leave you with Nicola Bryant's reaction to being presented with a Doctor In Distress copy to sign by /u/SerialChemist: [Post](http://www.reddit.com/r/doctorwho/comments/1y0jf2/this_is_what_happened_when_i_asked_nicola_bryant/) and [Link](http://i.imgur.com/hbookKF.jpg).

At the end of May/start of June Parents, Brother and myself are taking a trip to celebrate the Parents 40th Wedding Anniversary. 

We are all over 30, non drinkers (alcohol issues), none of us really have any major hobbies that we can share. Might be nice to do some walking (hills/scenery etc but only shorts walks) but seeing different tourist sites is cool as well. 

Last year we took a family trip to Bruges, Belgium for my Dads 80th. Was a very peaceful and lovely trip, I'd highly recommend.

Members of our party are scared to fly so limited to UK or ferry ports. No cars either so must be accessible by public transport. 

Over the years places we've either been together or individually include 

Glasgow, Edinburgh, Inverness, Aberdeen, Newcastle, Carlisle, Liverpool, Manchester, Birmingham, Worcester, Bath, Stratford-upon-avon, Oxford, York, Bournemouth, Cornwall (my favourite county in England!), and London.

With my Dads age, his health is still good but after an hour walking he really needs a seat so somewhere like the Lake District might not suit. We are open to places with theaters and cinemas. Its more about spending a few days as a family but always nice to find some things to do to pass the time as well.

Leaving the UK shores is always nice as it feels more like a holiday for me, as I say Bruges was a beautiful City to visit last year but very happy to find a nice location within the UK as well. 

None of us have been to Wales so this is a very strong possibility I feel, not sure where though, suggestions welcomed.

Think that covers quite a bit, maybe too much info but any ideas of places you have been/are from and think is a nice area to visit please do share and I'll look into it further.

Many thanks!

Since Blair came to power in the 90's the party has basically become Tory lite and abandoned much of their socialist ideas.

And due to their historical connection to trade unions and the working class in such things like the NHS, I think Labour still is the party of the working class in Britain. Smaller parties that try to hold on to what labour should be have no chance in parliament due to FPTP, and will never have the connections or base Labour has.

To get a three bed (one bedroom for the kids, one for us and one as a home office) is around 270k, and that is sorting by cheapest price on rightmove. This is for ex council or a cheap build project from the eighties, so we are not aiming high by any definition.

My job is secure (as much as they can be nowadays), and i am on a home based contract. 

Don't care about nightlife, shops and such. Just a relatively good area, not even rich, but don't want to be near any rough areas (who does?). We are also a mixed race family, and so i want to avoid communities that might be less tolerant / open to people who are different.

I'm from Texas and I'll be traveling to the UK for the first time for June and July as a 25yo female with my boyfriend (born and raised in Northern Ireland) to meet with his parents and their extended family (born and raised in London). Hope this post isn't too odd. 

I've done a lot of research and digging around online. Local stores, sights to be seen, inappropriate gestures, uncomfortable cultural history, even average yearly rainfall. I mean, I've had you under a microscope here lately. While, quite unorthodoxly, I am not interested in learning about things to do (since I'll have native guides as listed above), I am interested in a few things that I simply can't answer for myself:

1. Should I try to be as non-American as possible? Does the overwhelming amount of Texan (and the accent) I've got going on raise any particularly glaring red flags? I'm a grad student and a pacifist liberal, so not your typical George Bush here (breaking my parents' hearts), but I do own some guns just by my birth right I guess, so my neck might be redder than I think. Not trying to paint you a picture of my normalness, but is being American like being a circus clown (funny and gimmicky) or like being naked (awkward and embarrassing) or neither (or heaven help me - both)? My boyfriend just shrugs and says I'll be fine, but I want his family to enjoy my company - not look at me like I'm about to explode into eagles and freedom fries. Because, let me tell you, my family looked at my bf like he was going to morph into a tea-drinking, bagpipe-playing maniac. They don't get out much.

*

2. The... weather. I've read everything from it'll be in the nineties (Fahrenheit) to it will be in the forties. It's so frustrating trying to decide what coat to bring. In Houston it's like 100°F in the middle of the night during the summer so I'm pretty lost about these mild temps you've got. Any ladies have an example summer outfit for day and or night wear?
 
*

3. Going out to bars. In American movies, as I'm sure you've laughed at, we've got this thing about UK pubs where they're either adorable and Hobbity, or like extreme hooligan (?) bars where if your last name isn't recognizable or you don't know the football team, it's about to be a brawl. I get that it's likely not this way, but I'd appreciate any tips on how to blend in. Basics like how to order for me and my friends, how to get the bartender's attention, how do you tip? Is it rude to buy a round for some strangers? That sort of deal. I'm trying to be okay with the fact that y'all don't drink ice water, but there is ice right? Somewhere? Hopefully in the cocktails? Can I order cocktails at these pubs? I know there's probably menus. Just trying to be as cool as possible here. I've got folks to impress.

Thanks for taking the time to help me blend in. I've asked my bf about this all and looked on blogs, but the consensus is just the usual - you'll be fine, it's cute that you're loud as fuck, nobody minds that you break into applause for basically anything you find appealing, you call it a bathroom and that's wrong but so adorable. I'm not content with that, I guess. I'd like to make it my home one day so I'd love to start off on the right foot. 

Thanks again. Sorry if this was weird for you. Didn't mean to offend. 

Should mention we'll be in London, Manchester, York, Dublin, Belfast, and maybe Cardiff.

I ended up grabbing my phone back and ran down the stairs and they punched my head aswell. I told the driver to keep them on the bus but they ran off they followed me to where I was going I went to the bp station up the road on cov road. It was quite a busy road and I was probably going to flag down a car If I didnt manage to reach there in time. They were coming up slowly up the road behind me and once I reached the station some ppl asked if anything was wromg or if I was in trouble I told them someone was chasing me and trying to to rob me. I aksed them to stop them from coming further while I ran into the station I called my dad and asked him to pick me up I think they thought I was on the phone to the police so they ran across the road to the bus 900 that goes to town and they were long gone then my dad came and took me home and I told him what happened I called the police and then they came and took a statement and I gave them the code for the bus and everything and the cctv was running also I know its a slim chance they might find them.



But is there anyway I can get the cctv footage so I can somehow know how these guys look and I can avoid them

**Match Facts** (Courtesy of [BBC](http://www.bbc.com/sport/0/football/31785733))

**Head-to-head**

* Chelsea have lost just one of their last 11 Premier League games against Southampton (W6, D4).
* Southampton are without a win in five trips to Stamford Bridge (D2, L3). 
* Their last victory was 13 years ago, James Beattie with two goals in a 4-2 triumph.
* Chelsea have scored in each of their last nine league matches against the Saints.

**Chelsea**

* Chelsea are unbeaten in 14 home league games dating back to last season (W11, D3).
* They are the only team in the top four divisions in England not to have lost a home league match during 2014-15.
* The Blues have scored in each of their last 14 matches, and in all but one of their 28 Premier League games.
* Jose Mourinho's side have conceded just five league goals at Stamford Bridge this season - five fewer than any other team at home.
* Chelsea are the only side to have taken points off Southampton after conceding the opening goal. They did so in the 1-1 draw at St Mary's in December.

**Southampton**

* Defeat at West Brom in their last away game ended the Saints' five-match winning run in all competitions on the road.
* Southampton have conceded just 10 away league goals, five fewer than any other team.

So I currently hold an offer to study mathematics at Trinity college. I originally applied to Trinity because there seemed to be a unanimous agreement that Trinity was the hardest to get into, and the best for maths specifically - so I thought, why not go for it?
I've now heard that almost all of those at Trinity have competed in the IMO, with Trinity supposedly taking in most of the Chinese, Korean, and Serbian maths teams, and seeing as I failed to even qualify for the BMO2 I'm feeling quite out of my depth, and pretty inferior. Is this true? What proportion of 'trinmos' have actually competed in the IMO? What proportion of 'trinmos' get SS in STEP? What proportion of 'trinmos' get 1st class degrees? (I realise exact figures will be inaccessible for people who don't work in the data office, but any rough estimates would be appreciated!)

2. Is the frequency of events that require formal wear, i.e. formals and balls, such that it is worth buying a tuxedo outright instead of hiring one each time? I have my year 13 prom coming up soon so I thought if that is the case then I could save myself a bit of money.

3. I intend to start a sport when I join the university so that I don't get totally fat with all the constant drinking I'll be doing. Seeing as it's Cambridge, I thought I should try rowing. Considering that I have never rowed before, is there any way I could start from the beginning at Cambridge? Also, I've read satirical pieces on the tab which reference getting up for rowing training at 5 am - if resources are available for absolute beginner rowers as above, would I be allowed to join in with this training, or is it solely for the professionals? What are the training hours like?

4. Also, how much do you spend each week? The living costs guidelines on Trinity's website puts it at around £100 spending money each week, excluding accommodation - is this accurate?

I realise this is a lot of questions, but any answers would be greatly appreciated! Thank you!

**Jed Steer** - Guzan is our no. 1, and this isn't likely to change. Steer could be a decent back up though if Given retires.

**Joe Bennett** - Will make that left back spot his next year.

**Ron Vlaar** - He is too much injured I would sell him and rather use the money on someone else.

**Philippe Senderos** - Same as Vlaar.

**Kieran Richardson** - Could be a decent back up/squad player.

**Enda Stevens** - I liked what I saw from him in his first season under Lambert, and can't figure out why he never got more chances. 3 left backs is too much though, 1 have to go, and I think that is going to be Stevens.

**Yacouba Sylla** - Again a squad player, but can be counted on when needed.

**Aleksandar Tonev** - Super-sub, the sort of player we need if we are struggling to create something.

**Joe Cole** - Too old, can be sold. Got other and better options.

**Chris Herd** - Is out of contract, so will most likely leave. But I've always liked the spirit and attitude of Herd. He is always giving 100%, and I think he would be needed as a squad player.

** Gary Gardner** - Breakthrough season? We've been waiting for this for so long, and I think next year could be his. After a few injuries he'll get the chance to start a game, and keeps that place for the rest of the season.

**Darren Bent** - Will most likely leave, and I won't be disappointed. He is getting older, and does not contribute a lot to the play. And with Gabby and Benteke performing like they have, who needs Bent?

**Antonio Luna** - I'd rather play Shay Given at left back than this guy, and there is only so much Sherwood can do. Cut the losses and get him out as soon as possible.

**Niklas Helenius** - Super sub, can come in and change the game for us.



Just realised what a big squad we have. It needs to be trimmed, and whoever isn't part of Sherwood's plan should be sold. To be honest I don't think we need that many new players now, as long as we bring in Sinclair and Cleverley. Perhaps we need a back-up keeper, depending on what Given is going to do. Given has said that he wants to play football, but I don't see that happening in Villa, and he is too old to get a new contract as a first choice goalkeeper. He might see this himself and retire, but most likely I think he'll see out his contract and join our coaching team after. What we absolutely withh 100% certainty need is central defenders. Vlaar will most likely leave, and with Baker and Senderos injured as much as they are we probably need at least 2 decent back ups, or more likely 1 first choice to partner Clark and 1 back up.

I'm a graduate student from Berlin and will be staying in Oxford for 7 months starting in August of this year while doing lab work for my Master thesis. I've been searching for accomodation on the internet (I know it's early but I like to be prepared) and the things I've found so far have been quite expensive. 

Is there a way to stay in student accomodations (i.e. in a college) for visiting students, that is, students not enrolled at oxford? I would also appreciate any help or advice regarding finding cheap accomodation outside of colleges!

Aside from that I was also wondering what living costs in oxford are like. How much money is needed to get by every month? This is for a student used to living frugally.

We intend to steer conversations until he says words or phrases we don't use in America — all in the hope that we can fill our individually made Bingo cards while not getting caught by him. 

My English friend has a great sense of humor, and this is all in good fun. He'd do the same to us if we were going to the UK (we make fun of each other's ways of speaking all the time). Once one of us has won the game, we fully intend to tell him what we'd been up to and we'll all have a good laugh about it. 

So the reason I'm posting here is to see if I can get some help for words and phrases to put on the cards. My intention is that the keywords won't be outlandish or impossible to get him to say.

Constantly out of position, doesn't know how to close down crosses and often has lapses of concentration. How many goals have we conceded this season due to his mistakes? 

Luis could have been the solution to many of our problems on wednesday in terms of pressing, overlapping runs and crossing. Whenever he plays he is fantastic but for some reason Jose doesn't trust him. 

I go mental whenever Ivanovic bangs one in, but that's not his job. So many times we've conceded and almost conceded due to his defensive mistakes. I think we're missing the point that Luis was a very important player in Atleti and possibly the best left back in the world and it was always going to take time for him to settle to the fast-paced game of the premier league. Nonetheless, he's been great everytime he has played.

Is there any reasonable argument that can be made for trying to get Mata back? Our no10 Oscar doesnt cut it right now and he's fell of towards the second half of the season again. Mata was also decent at drifting towards the wing. I think we need someone with better link up play in the final third.

I probably am speaking out of my arse but hes still only 26. Would anyone take him back? Its probably not even realistic but would you guys on the sub want us to make an offer for him in the summer if we could? On a side note it actually makes me quite sad seeing how he has declined since he got benched by us, such a waste of talent in the last few years (not blaming anyone in particular) but when you consider how good he was and where he is now as a fan of a footballer of that talent you have to feel the sense of ""what if"" or ""imagine how he would be now if""",false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,null,null,default,Discussion - Getting Mata back?,0,http://www.reddit.com/r/chelseafc/comments/2z4uxb/discussion_getting_mata_back/

Here you can get the A1 at 16 years old and then the A2 at 18. A good few of my friends are getting 125s but my parents aren't too happy with that idea. I was thinking of waiting until I'm 18 and getting the A2 as the cost is the same, but would at 250/300 be too much for me to learn on as my only experience is limited to a short ride on a quad 4 years ago?

I remember a few weeks ago in /r/mapporn or something like that, somebody posted a map of Ireland showing the percentage of fluent Irish speakers in Ireland. 

Somebody in the comments said ""I'm not any less Irish because I don't speak Irish"".

Now, I'm Germany. Before there was a German state, language was pretty much the only thing that connected us as a people and propaganda songs of that time even defined Germany as ""the place where the German tongue rings"".

So for me, you can't be German without speaking German. Just doesn't work in my head. It's a big (if not the only) part of ""being German"", in my opinion.

I understand that the situation in places where harsh language policies caused some damage is very different from my own.

So how much does the language play a role for you as a Welsh person? Not necessary speaking it but the fact that it's alive unlike other minority languages like native American ones that face all kinds of problems Welsh doesn't. Do you think that the language plays a role in the ""Welsh identity"" and does speaking Welsh make you ""more Welsh"" than others?

I hope it's clear that I'm not judging anybody. Like I said, I understand that the situation in Wales, Ireland, Brittany and so on is quite different from other languages and I understand if there's no desire to learn the language. Just asking for opinions :D

#Match Facts

**Head-to-head**

* Swansea have beaten Liverpool only once in seven matches (D3, L3) since winning promotion to the Premier League in 2011.

* Brendan Rodgers was the Swansea manager for that sole Premier League win, a 1-0 triumph at the Liberty Stadium in May 2012.

* Liverpool have won just two of 13 league matches away to Swansea (D4, L7).

* The last four Premier League fixtures between the sides have produced 21 goals.

**Swansea**

* They have only lost three home matches this season, and 25 of their 40 points have come at the Liberty Stadium.

* Swansea have claimed only 13 of their 40 points against sides in the top half of the table (W4, D1).

* The Swans have conceded five second-half goals at the Liberty Stadium; only Chelsea have let in fewer at home only with three.

* Eight of their 11 Premier League wins have been by the odd goal.

* Jonjo Shelvey has scored in the last three league matches between the clubs as a Swansea player, albeit the last of which was an own goal.

Indeed Labs Facial Powdered Exfoliator

Product description

""Introducing the NEW Indeed Labs facial powdered exfoliator. This water-activated enzyme micro-powder gently exfoliates, helping to reveal polished looking, soft and smooth skin. Packed with 5 key actives.Just add water to this innovative micro-powder, packed with actives, including:• Bamboo extract: Different from common exfoliants as it's fine enough to feel gentle on skin, yet offers extremely effective exfoliation and antibacterial cleansing. It’s naturally rich in silica, an essential element known for its acne and wrinkle fighting properties.• Rice bran powder: Used by the Japanese for centuries for softer, smoother feeling skin. It gently exfoliates and is said to help prevent wrinkles, heal blemishes and absorb dirt and oil from pores as well as moisturise.• Okinawa red algae: This natural wonder is ultra nourishing to the skin and body. Red algae is a vital source of Beterhelin, a natural polysaccharide that promotes the skin’s barrier function and enhances moisture retention, along with free radical-scavenging properties, a key element for skin exposed to damaging sun rays. • Hyaluronic acid: A natural substance found in the body that helps to hydrate skin and stimulate production of collagen. It works as an antioxidant and free radical scavenger and also helps to maintain skin elasticity. Decreasing levels of hyaluronic acid are known to accompany the ageing process. Hyaluronic acid helps to retain its weight in water within the cells of skin, making it an excellent moisturiser.• Bromelain: These enzymes are essential to maintain good health and skin. Bromelain is a mixture of enzymes found naturally in the juice and stems of pineapples. Bromelain used in skin care treatments is an alpha hydroxy acid (AHA) and is very effective in gently removing dead cells by chemical exfoliation, on the surface of the skin. Enzymatic activity destroys the keratin of dead cells and debris, allowing skin to breathe.""

How to Use

After cleansing, dispense two shakes and mix with as much or as little water as desired to create a foamy consistency. Massage onto wet face using circular motions for one minute, avoiding the eye area. Rinse thoroughly. Formulated for all skin types.

My skin: fairly balanced at the moment, not too dry but have some fine lines around eyes. Closed comedones on chin and some sf on nose, they're proving quite stubborn. 
Mild rosacea seems to be under control at the moment but could be improved a bit.

My mom discovered this secret surprise. She has an exploding TARDIS towel in her bathroom, which recently just happened to be folded and oriented so that it was impossible for her not to notice: [Amy's face, subtly yet undeniably present in one of the impressionist swirls of Vincent's final, prophetic painting](http://i.imgur.com/9A0dROC.jpg)

I like to think that Vincent the soothsayer was not only tortured by his foretelling of the destruction of the TARDIS, but also by the idea that beautiful Amy Pond-- who inexplicably sought him out, who showed him unconditional care and concern, who loved and praised his ""worthless"" paintings-- would be destroyed along with it. And so he paid a small, personal tribute of his love for her in his last, tortured piece of art.

Since I don't have a TrueBlue membership and my supporter's club is not officially linked with Chelsea, my only legitimate route to purchase tickets was through the hospitality route. I want to post a review of my experience here for anyone else considering doing so - I was unable to find any posts that really discussed the pros and cons of the experience.

I did the matchdays at the museum package, and the first con for most people about this is the price - £300 for most people is something they could never afford, and I must admit, I am extremely lucky that my family helped out with purchasing this ticket. However, despite the steep price, I found the experience very much worth it.

The day started at 9am with tea and coffee in the Chelsea Museum. The majority of the people who purchased this package were fathers with their young sons - as someone in my mid 20s, this was initially an awkward situation until I found a few other people around my age. 

It was a basic breakfast of pastries and hot beverages before we were led on a mini-tour of the stadium. We were taken down to pitchside where we were able to enter through the players tunnel and snap a few photos while learning about the history of the team and the stadium. After the pitchside tour, there was a chance to do some shopping at the Megastore before heading back to the museum for lunch and drinks.

The museum itself is fairly small and could probably be done in less than an hour - it has a few game worn jerseys and equipment on display, alongside some major trophies Chelsea has won. One of the nicer little exhibits was of Jose Morinho's desk from 2004-2007 with a notebook of his tactics on display on the desk and his trademark Armani overcoat draped over the chair.

The lunch was very good - fresh hot roast beef sandwiches, hot bowls of chicken and sausage wrapped in bacon, artichoke and truffle ravioli and dark chocolate mousse for dessert. Having a meal among all those historic items was a very cool experience. Also for those that take part in the hospitality package, there is an open bar of beer, wine and other soft drinks. I had enough time to have about 3 beers before heading into the stadium to watch the teams warm up.

Before heading into the stadium, we had the highlight of the entire experience - we had a Q&amp;A and autograph session with 3 Chelsea legends - Tommy Baldwin, Ron Harris, and Bobby Tambling - that's right, Bobby Tambling who held Chelsea's goal scoring record with 202 goals for the team until Frank Lampard broke it last year. The three legends told stories from their playing days and basically joked around with each other for twenty minutes before a 5 minute Q&amp;A and a chance for autographs - we all got our 110 year commemorative match day programs signed by all three.

After this amazing experience, we were given an ""exclusive chelsea gift"" - an umbrella with the team logo on it and two drink tickets to use inside the stadium. We went to the stadium just before the players came out to warm up, watched the warm ups, drank some beers, and enjoyed the match - despite dropping the two points, it was the most incredible sports experience of my life. I highly recommend the hospitality package to anyone who's on the fence about parting with that much money in order to see the boys play. 

PS - I invite anyone who's done the UTB Sports Lounge package to post a similar review - it was the other option I was considering and would have found it helpful to have some more information about what the experience is like from a supporter's point of view!

I have just turned 29, and I am about to drop out of a University course, which for all intents and purposes, is CGI, Digital Animation, and it also has a bit of web design thrown in for good measure. 

The experience up to this point has been disappointing, and I am surrounded by young students whom I have nothing in common with. I am not really learning anything on the course that I couldn't learn with the right software and some online tutorials. 
I also don't think that I am cut out for a life spent sat in front of a computer for hours at a time, making countless adjustments to parameters, gradients and shadows etc etc..

Prior to starting this course, I did an Access to Higher Education course in Art &amp; Design, which I started in September 2013, and finished May 2014. 

I have not held a full time job since December 2013 - but I did have a part time job working for a small adult education centre, which mainly involved putting together information packs, updating the display screen in the corridor, and going to the odd education fair and setting up an information stand.  I had no guidance on this job - I was pretty much just left to get on with things. Before that, I worked for 6 months in the library of the sixth form college the learning centre is affiliated with.

Previous to those roles, I spent four years as a Learning Support Assistant, drifting along in the role, making minimum wage and only really staying due to the fact that I had made some close friends at work. I worked in retail before doing the above jobs.

My education is patchy - crap GCSE's, dropped out of sixth form college after six months, a bit of Open University study (two introductory modules), an Adult Numeracy at Level 2, and that is about it..oh, and the Access course, which is only useful for University application to art and design courses. 

I suffer from anxiety and depression, and have suffered from OCD in the past as well. 

I get so disheartened when I read about all of the young graduates struggling to find work, and they are young, bold and spirited with good qualifications in challenging subjects! What hope would I have with a vague digital arts degree, past the age of 30, and with totally irrelevant work experience? An honest appraisal of my design work makes me realise that it is very average, but I don't really have any skills beyond using the core programs in the Adobe Creative Suite...

I really don't know where to take myself next. I will be back in my home town looking for minimum wage work, with my 30's fast approaching. I have been able to get away with not having a job for two years now, due to the financial support of my parents and some savings (which are now completely gone). 

Can anyone give me some advice as to how I could turn my current situation around? What options do I have available to me bearing in mind I have a pretty underwhelming employment history and this big gap in my CV?

There are three sensible targets:

Brighton Pavilion - Obviously

Norwich South - Most likely they will come second here. The latest poll put them on 20% to Labour's 33%, I can't imagine they will turn that around before the general election.

Bristol West - This is probably the most winnable seat. They got a lot of local election votes but can they transfer it into a seat? Who knows, theres no polling for Bristol West.

Then there comes the silly ones:

Solihull - In the latest Ashcroft poll they polled 6% which is lower than they are polling nationally. How can they target a seat which they could get a lower percentage than their average? They may have a lot of councillors here, but half of them have defected and not actually been voted for as Greens.

Sheffield Central - This one is more sensible but most likely after the election it will be a safe Labour seat after the Lib Dems collapse. They didn't even get their deposit back last time! it would be possible for them to come 2nd or 3rd here, but a long way off of Labour.

Liverpool Riverside - an even safer Labour seat. Maybe they will come second here but more due to a lack of opposition to Labour than a Green surge.

Oxford East - Another seat which is very safe for Labour, perhaps they will get 3rd place if the Lib Dems REALLY collapse but most likely they will stay in 4th or be pushed back to 5th by UKIP.

St Ives - This one really confuses me. Cornwall isn't exactly a left wing hotbed, take it from me - I live there. Ashcroft had them at 6% in this seat also, do the expect to win? I doubt it. They claim to get an average of 18% in council elections but perhaps that is because they only stood in a handful of seats. This is not a realistic target.

The list goes on here: https://my.greenparty.org.uk/elections/general-election-2015/target-advance

Maybe I am being unfairly harsh, but where do we expect to get the support from in these seats? Natalie Bennett recently said we could get as many as 6 seats but i have absolutely no idea where! The Ashcroft polls aren't encouraging. If we can't manage Norwich South, where else will we win? It looks as though Caroline Lucas will be very lonely in the House of Commons which is quite disappointing. We desperately need a more proportional electoral system.",false,UKGreens,t5_34166,null,null,default,How do the Greens choose their target seats?,1,http://www.reddit.com/r/UKGreens/comments/2z5o90/how_do_the_greens_choose_their_target_seats/

I've been looking into buying a flat in London, maybe Southwark; up and coming, zone 2, seems like a solid choice. I hope to be earning around £30k in new job, which would mean a monthly takehome of around £1800. I don't have much in savings, around £2k. 

I've been looking at 1 bed shared ownership new built properties. They go for £85k for 25%, with rent and service charge at around £700.

My problem is that with so little savings, I don't seem to have a lot of choices at the moment. Banks need around 10% deposit, and with legal fees and everything I'd need around £10k to be comfortable, I think. If I rent in London, it'd take me forever to get enough savings.

What are my options? Is it worth trying to get a personal loan for the deposit? Or just sit tight for a year and rent?

I'm a 24 year old guy from Scotland and my partner is 23. I currently work full time up here making £19,000 basic(26,000 overtime). My partner is a student and will be graduating this summer. We both live with our parents and live a pretty lavish lifestyle. Nice cars, phones and eat out most nights and I pay for pretty much everything. Not much in the way of debt. I have around £800 in debt to clear and she has around £1000. Not too responsible with our money just now and I realise that. She has been offered an amazing job with a company down in the midlands making £29,000 basic with a £2000 joining bonus. I think it works out to be around £1800 after tax. We've discussed it and decided to take the leap. We both don't really have any friends up here and have no real ties to where we live. We would be moving to Warwickshire. Somewhere around Leamington Spa.


We will be moving in around September time. I'll obviously have to leave my job. However i've reached the point in my career where freelancing is pretty much the next natural progression for me. Here's my issue. My partner, since she has finished uni doesn't want to pick up any work this summer and instead wants to go travelling and wants me to go with her. This will obviously cost a tonne of money and I believe that the best thing for us to be doing is saving considering I might not have an income for the first while. Am I crazy in saying that travelling is a bad idea?


Having not really moved out before. How much can we expect to have to put away in preparation to move out and also how can 2 people comfortably live on one salary?

Thoughts on this lineup?  We need Yaya in the pocket for this game.  His ability to hold off the Wolfpack of Barcelona players as they swarm him in front of their goal will be necessary.  He will be able to tap off to silva Nasri or Aguero on the edge of the box. 

I chose Sagna over kolorav because I think he is faster and will be better at keeping Suarez under control.  

I imagine our six midfielders and aguero dropping back deep in order to clog the pitch and stop Barca's ability to pass.   We should do this for the first half and try to get one goal in the first 45 minutes.  

In the second half bring on another striker depending on how the setup is working.  Maybe sub Bony on for dinho and go all out for the second goal if we aren't getting many chances.

I'm /u/almightywibble, a member of the Labour Party in the Model House of Commons. We're looking both for new members of the subreddit, and also for people who wish to vote in our General Election.

What is the Model House of Commons? It is a subreddit which aims to be an online  real life House of Commons, with plenty of opportunities for both fun and politics. There's a massive spread of parties, with a massive spread of views, from far-left communism, to far-right ultranationalism; even those parties which resemble existing ones are massively different from their RL counterparts. I would wholeheartedly suggest you get involved, regardless of political views or affiliations; even if there isn't a party which matches you, you can run as an independent candidate, or alternatively, if you can find enough people, you can start one of your own! It's a great hobby, which really acts to open the mind, and improve your knowledge of how the country works, and your ability to express your views.

Now, why should you join Labour? We're the parliamentary representatives of the 'pragmatic Left'. We do not seek to reinvent the wheel; only make the wheel we already have better. We do not advocate a stateless society, or communal ownership of all property, or other such hallmarks of the far left.  Labour are a party of social democracy, a party for justice, equality and wellbeing. We seek not to tear down the foundations on which this country has been built on, but to force the system to serve those who it exists to serve; the people. We seek to make a country where none go hungry, where none suffer because they cannot afford healthcare, where none live as wage slaves to multinational corporations. All this, while maintaining a healthy economy, and a balanced budget.

Does this intrigue you? Or would you rather join an opposing party? Either way, there's a place for you. All you have to do is [join a party](http://pay.reddit.com/r/MHOC/comments/2kima2/join_a_party/); all the instructions you'll need are on the page. Once you've got that down, start debating!

It's essentially a prediction for the 3rd and 4th spots based on overall form over the course of the season. I figured I'd post it while I take a break from work.

[Link](http://imgur.com/a/8lNjk)

To summarize: 

Arsenal last year finished with 79 points at 2.09 PPG. I tracked the accumulation of points for all 3 teams and ran a simple polynomial regression via Excel (which consists of graphing the data and clicking ""show regression line"") on all of them for a projection of where each time looks likely to end up, based on the trends exhibited during the season. The R^2 looks really good for all of them. The equation for the regression line and R^2 value has been provided for all graphs.

There is also a comparison of the progress for Arsenal/Liverpool based on current progress. As it stands, both teams are projected to surpass the 79 point mark left by Arsenal left season (which is insane, for a 4th place spot).

Interestingly enough, Man U's projection predicts a finish below the 79 point total, which reflects the relatively stable performance from them over the course of the season.

As it stands, the model predicts Arsenal finishing the season at 82.72 points, and Liverpool finishing with 82.59 points; barely a difference, but with Arsenal just barely edging us out, especially based on overall performance since the beginning of the season.

I included the projections based on performances since December, and our projected points total increases dramatically, taking us above and beyond Arsenal, possibly for a 2nd/3rd place finish.

Of course, there are lots of caveats to be taken from something like this. It does show our huge upturn in form, though. It's not something to be ignored, and if the form keeps up, it will make up for our deficiencies at the beginning of the season. I think if we keep up our current form (beating Southampton, Tottenham, Man City, and Burnley on the trot), it stands to chance that by the end of this coming week, we will be looking at a 4th place spot.

Knock on wood. I'm going to go throw salt over my shoulder and sacrifice a virgin lamb while burning an effigy of SAF. Brb.

I'm /u/almightywibble, a member of the Labour Party in the Model House of Commons. We're looking both for new members of the subreddit, and also for people who wish to vote in our General Election.

What is the Model House of Commons? It is a subreddit which aims to be an online  real life House of Commons, with plenty of opportunities for both fun and politics. There's a massive spread of parties, with a massive spread of views, from far-left communism, to far-right ultranationalism; even those parties which resemble existing ones are massively different from their RL counterparts. I would wholeheartedly suggest you get involved, regardless of political views or affiliations; even if there isn't a party which matches you, you can run as an independent candidate, or alternatively, if you can find enough people, you can start one of your own! It's a great hobby, which really acts to open the mind, and improve your knowledge of how the country works, and your ability to express your views.

Now, why should you join Labour? We're the parliamentary representatives of the 'pragmatic Left'. We do not seek to reinvent the wheel; only make the wheel we already have better. We do not advocate a stateless society, or communal ownership of all property, or other such hallmarks of the far left.  Labour are a party of social democracy, a party for justice, equality and wellbeing. We seek not to tear down the foundations on which this country has been built on, but to force the system to serve those who it exists to serve; the people. We seek to make a country where none go hungry, where none suffer because they cannot afford healthcare, where none live as wage slaves to multinational corporations. All this, while maintaining a healthy economy, and a balanced budget.

Does this intrigue you? Or would you rather join an opposing party? Either way, there's a place for you. All you have to do is [join a party](http://pay.reddit.com/r/MHOC/comments/2kima2/join_a_party/); all the instructions you'll need are on the page. Once you've got that down, start debating! Bills and motions are proposed daily, so get your voice heard! I'll see you on the other side :)",false,manchester_uni,t5_2spim,null,null,self,Ever fancied yourself an MP?

Already I see people wanting Salah and Schürrle back. Already I see people rating Cuadrado as utter rubbish.
Yes his shift yesterday was not up to par at all but he hasn't even played a lot, limited to sub performances in a brand new league + club and yet we dont have faith to believe in his ability. Why arent we giving him time to settle? Does one need to score the winner for him to be accepted? I find this very disheartening as a fan who likes to see new players and youth involved with team. Why is that we are so quick to ridicule our own players? :(
Once upon a time there were people giving so much stick to KdB. Now they want him back here. 

I know this isnt all of you. But please give some of the guys some time and game time to adapt. How can we judge someone's true potential when they come off the bench all the time (eg. Salah?) 
I wish to see a more support for our new and youth players.

It only seems like yesterday I made a similar post for 5,000.

I've noticed a few things over the past months - some good, some not so good:

* Much less spam coming through. The whole mod team has been working hard removing spam links quickly and warning people with spammy usernames/motives.
* Lots of very similar questions. This is obviously unavoidable to an extent, but it suggests that we maybe need to work on some new FAQ entries.
* There is a worrying tendency of people to reply with very little knowledge about circumstances with an air of authority that doesn't match the situation. **posting bad information is worse than posting no information**. I find myself spending a lot of time correcting people, which is tedious and unnecessary. This links into...
* Very little by way of corroborating evidence. I know it's annoying having to find a source to back up a suggestion, but it would *significantly* improve the quality of the sub. We do make that suggestion on comments but do not enforce it in any way.
* Lots of throwaways being used. This probably inflates the subscriber numbers somewhat, and it would be great if people felt confident enough to not use throwaways (or if people who do use them come back and subscribe with their main account.

In the back of my mind are:

* More FAQ content (time consuming)
* Requiring sources for answers (very hard to implement and moderate)
* User flair (hard to agree on a sensible implementation)
* None of the above (if it ain't broke don't fix it)

The above are just my thoughts - I'd be happy to hear views from others and any suggestions for improvements.

I called into my local store last week to see when i could upgrade. Spur of the moment, I wasn't expecting to upgrade there and then.  They told me that they could do it for me right away and I could trade my old phone in. So everything goes through okay and they say that if I leave my old phone with them for an hour they can transfer all of my data. They made me log out of my apple Id to do this.  

So, I return in an hour and everything has been transferred and they tell me that they will keep all the data on my old phone until it's ready to be sent off to make sure that everything has transferred correctly to my new phone.  

When I got home it suddenly dawned on me that ALL of my online banking, paypal, ebay etc was still logged in. I began thinking about my photos and videos and my heart dropped. Please don't judge me but amongst 2000 photos of various pets, photos of my friends children that have automatically saved from Whatsapp and drunken singing videos there is one really sensitive private video that I'd completely forgotten about. Now, I am absolutely terrified that they look through my phone and see this. 

Please can someone just put my mind at ease. I think I had about 100 videos on my phone and this particular one was right in the middle. What are the chances of the staff members looking through my phone? Do they have policies within store about looking through customer's phones etc? If the worst case scenario does happen and they look through it and find this particular video where do I stand? When you trade in your phone is there a time limit on how long they keep it before restoring the factory settings? My banking that is logged in I cannot change the password for because it is linked to my work so I'm just hoping that they erase all the data before sending it away but everything else I have changed the passwords for.

ive always walked to school/work and generally dont drive if i can avoid. ive noticed over the past few years, mainly as a pedestrian, but increasingly as a driver that a significant number of people seem to be texting. male, female, old, young.

it's very obvious when someone is staring down at their laps and just seems outrageously stupid.

mate got a new car the other week and the thing seems to encourage you to use your phone its got handsfree but also a keypad for dialing and texting.

a 2008 RAC study on facebook said 45% of people text and drive. you can debate the audience of the study, but still its a heck of a lot. this study is one of several suggesting it can be worse than other distractors http://trid.trb.org/view.aspx?id=877768

&gt; This study highlighted that when texting, a driver may present a greater accident risk than when at the legal limit for alcohol consumption or when under the influence of cannabis, reinforcing that drivers should refrain from this dangerous activity.

is it just me, or has it become socially acceptable? and does anyone else feel this is a really bad thing? if you do it - why?

edit: glad to see im not the only one seeing this is an issue. love the idea of being able to report people conveniently. ive reported someone for dangerous driving before but it seems the police only look into it if they are later involved in an indcident. i imagine voice control helps mitigate distraction, but most people seem to be holding their phones beneath the wheel to use it. there are lots of apps that will share your location with contacts, so they can see if you're running late (and where). you can even use ifttt to automaticallyl text people when your a sertain distance away.",false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,null,null,default,"Mobile phones whilst driving, why doesn't this seem to be an issue?",117,http://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/2z7y8b/mobile_phones_whilst_driving_why_doesnt_this_seem/

Went out on the motorcycle during the weekend, weather OK, wasn't raining (dry roads) but I had a few problems which caused me to cut short my rides.

I found that when I was going round corners, or roundabouts, it felt like my back tire was sliding out a tiny amount but I would suddenly tense up on the arms. I also found it that when I joined a national speed limit road, I increased my speed fairly steadily (a tiny amount of bend in the road) and my back tire suddenly felt like it slipped and I promptly shat (not literally) myself but carried on. I've never had this problem yet (though a lack of confidence in cornering and I've been riding 11 months total)

Is this something I'm doing wrong, or is it the tire? I looked around the back end, but it seemed ok and I could see anything in the wheel. Luckily I have an MOT this week or next so it might be he finds something.

Any advice on how to practice cornering too?

Hope that makes sence?

Cheers,
M34.

I'm much more relaxed about it now, you've all reinforced what I already thought - I just needed to hear it from someone else - so thank you all for taking the time to help me out. 

/r/MotoUK, I need some help and kind words here.

Ever since I've had my full license I have been incredibly paranoid of speeding. Now, let me make clear I have never *ever* been caught speeding. I've never had a NIP or so much as a police officer pull me over. I pride myself on riding safely, so that means sticking to the limit and not pushing my luck with the fuzz (anyone who has read a post by me on this subreddit knows I'm a fairly pragmatic and sensible bloke). Besides the legal implications, I think speed limits are there for a reason and above all else, I don't want to be hurt (or hurt anyone) on the bike.

I've had my YBR since May 2014 and have had a clean license ever since then. Don't get me wrong, my YBR could have broken plenty of limits and set off plenty of cameras, but alas I didn't.

This has all started since my first fright a few weeks ago, when I went past a mobile camera van in a 40mph zone. I didn't realize the van was there until I was parallel with it and then past it. Made me think ""Shit, did I just speed through there?"" and I really chewed my nails for the few weeks after. Like, *really* worried about it. I was really beating myself up about it and every time I caught myself on or a hairs width of the speedo needle over the limit I went back into this swirl of paranoia and despair. I know that the advisory guidlines for speed partnerships are 10%+2mph but all facts went out of the window - all I thought of was getting those 6 points and loosing my full bike license.

Turns out I didn't get any NIP through the post and nothing came of it. I wasn't speeding. But it has really shook me up.

I couldn't remember my exact speed at the time I went past it. Not knowing that information and being able to recall it and use it to reassure myself really makes me doubt myself and I can't be sure that I am in the clear, so I can't relax and let it go. Of course, nobody would remember that figure - you're on autopilot, you're doing the same thing you do everyday and you do the correct thing by nature. The pragmatic, sensible approach is ""I've not been caught speeding in the last ~12 months of riding, so why would I get caught now? I ride the same, it's no different"". But it's that fear of getting 6 points and loosing my license that worries me, and it's getting really silly now. Ever time I go out on the bike I find I worry. Even when I know that I have done the speed limit (or under the speed limit) the entire trip, I still doubt myself. I know the minimum points for speeding is 3, but that's two offenses and than bam, no license for Spiffy. But this thinking isn't healthy and needs to stop.

I went through a speed camera zone on Saturday and thought the stretch of road was 30mph. Turns out it was 40mph. You would think that my brain would say ""Yeah you're blatantly clear there Spiffy you slow bastard, holding up traffic"" - does it though? Does it f**k - it thinks about that change over to the right hand lane I made where I had to pick up speed slightly. it doesn't think about the heavy traffic in front and behind that forced me to stick at 30-35mph.

I'm a logical, down to earth chap but this is silly. Come on /r/MotoUK - you're all experienced, knowledgeable folk with many of you riding much longer than I have. I need a good talking to to get myself out of this mindset. Took a bit of plucking up the courage to make this post but I'm hoping that with you kind guys and gals pointing out that I have absolutely zero to worry about, I might trust you more than I trust myself!",false,MotoUK,t5_2wf1v,null,null,self,Speeding paranoia,11,http://www.reddit.com/r/MotoUK/comments/2z8ell/speeding_paranoia/

**Confidence**

Player confidence is at an extreme low - at least one first 11 player questions whether they are up to the standard required of the PL. ""We keep getting overrun"" is a phrase that's used.

**Factions remain in the camp**

There are a group of approximately 6 players who do not train with the bulk of the team (do not adhere to the main training regime). This group includes 2 of the usual suspects and some of our most experienced stalwarts, who feel they know better- The likes of SWP and Taarabt are laws unto themselves.

**Training/Coaching methods**

This was highlighted as the most important factor in our under performance. We have inherited Harry's training approach, which has changed little in style since the 1990's.
If you look at the likes of Mourhino and other elite team managers and their coaching staff, they make notes during  games - they are writing down player names and the minute of the game that player makes a mistake. They then use that information to coach the mistake out of the player. Allegedly modern techniques like this are not used at QPR and haven't been, at least since Harry started with us. 

We have the same coaching staff as under Harry, senior players are having trouble respecting the training techniques being used. The brief honeymoon period under Ramsey is long over.

It's not expected the FA will allow that money to be written off, meaning we are likely to see lengthy legal proceedings between QPR and the FA, should we go down this season.

**Conclusion**

Perhaps none of this tells us anything we didn't already know. What did make an impression on me is the very low self-confidence of the team, their apparent acceptance that we are relegated and the overriding dissatisfaction with the way things are being done at QPR - it is not felt we are a viable Premier League club.

NB: It should be noted that this was feedback on Saturday evening, after we'd been thumped by Palace.

-----------------------------------------------------

EDIT: I'm sorry it sounds so gloomy. It's worth remembering that the above issues are not really new to the club and were likely affected by Saturday's defeat in the telling.

* Phillips is less effective at LM than RM but it has been working so far and his defensive cover has helped Yun.  Our only other options at LM are Hoilett and Traore who have not been particularly effective.
* Replace Henry with Barton. I'm sure this was bound to happen anyway but will improve the quality of the midfield.
* Get Taarabt off the pitch, leave in Zamora and Austin up front.  At least we know the type of performance we will get out of Zamora, less so with Taarabt, I don't care if he can *change* a game.

I'm an established user but I thought I'd create a new account to advertise this so as not to involve my personal Reddit account.

I work for City of York Council (boo, hiss), and I've been organising a Jobs Fair. CYC have run a few Jobs Fairs over the last few years (every March and September), and they are usually really well attended and quite successful.

We have a new Jobs Fair happening this Thursday! It will be taking place at the York Railway Institute, which is next to the train station (address: 22 Queen Street York YO24 1AD).

Doors open from 10am and close at 3pm. It's **free** to enter, and we even provide tea and coffee. 

We've a whole host of employers and learning providers attending (70+ at the last count). Although most are maybe not wholly appropriate for graduates (the Uni's have their own jobs fairs..), it still is probably worth coming down so you can practise talking to employers and to see what's about. 

I know for a fact we have one employer coming who **DO HAVE** vacancies relating to computer science.. however for national security reasons (yes, really) I'm not permitted to advertise who it is (although I'm sure you can guess..). You'll just have to come down and find out for yourself!

[Here is an image showing *some* of the employers coming, and their number of vacancies.](http://i.imgur.com/d6avAXt.png)

If you never managed to get a C in English or Maths at GCSE, we're also going to have free Functional Skills assessments, which can lead onto free accredited Functional Skills courses. I'm currently doing my Maths Functional Skills, and it's really useful.

And if you do end up coming along, I'd urge you to fill out the quick feedback form (it's like five questions), that'll be on the back of the Welcome Letter we'll give you on coming in. I've just spent two days grappling with Excel and Word to make it fit onto A4 properly, so it'd be nice to have more than 10% of visitors filling out the survey! And of course, feedback allows us to improve the next event. 

If you've got any questions or comments, feel free to PM or post.

Basically, I would post the link to a Google Drive poll each week and the board could choose three players they thought were the Man of the Match candidates. Then after the voting period closes we announce a winner each week. Meanwhile, I'll keep a running tally of total votes for every Hammer and at the end of the year we'd have a de facto Hammer of the Year.

It doesn't make a ton of sense to do it this season with only 9 games remaining, but I thought we could test it this year, then next year we could make it ""official"" and possibly send something to the winner at the end of the season.

What do you guys think?

There are a few things that have come up recently in Mod Chat, and I would just like to clarify our position quickly on them. 

**URL Shorteners**

Firstly we have noticed that URL shorteners have been used (EFC.link), these are kind-of against Reddit rules, and they offer no benefit to the user, with a fair bit of detriment (harder to search for articles and evading spam filter). Because of this we have decided to ask nicely for you to stop using them. 

**Linking to your site**

Secondly, there are a few users who have been using /r/Everton as a bit of a free content distribution service, without bringing anything else to the community. I would like to reiterate that we have no issue with people posting their own content, but we ask if you only do so if you are an active member of the community. 

Other subreddits have a 10:1 system, where you should make 10 comments for each link you post to your site- for me this is a bit harsh (and other mods agree), but would like to see site owners bringing a bit more to the comments. I don't think we need a hard and fast rule, as 10 posts of crap are worth less than 1 great one- but just bear in mind that giving back, and adding to discussion is what makes Reddit great. 

---

As ever, if you have any issues, suggestions or just want to say hi- send a PM to /r/Everton (or click the message the mods button on the right), and we will do our best to help you out. 

I have said it before, but it is worth saying again; this is a fantastic community, and as mods we have to do very little to keep things running. Thank you again for making our lives easy, and /r/Everton the best place online to talk about our club!",false,Everton,t5_2qpfg,null,null,self,[MODPOST] - On URL Shortners and Posting Your Own Content.,10,http://www.reddit.com/r/Everton/comments/2z8wfu/modpost_on_url_shortners_and_posting_your_own/

I'm on a scooter so they may make recommendations a little harder.

A few general questions:

1. Should I replace both front and back at the same time? the front looks dirty but hardly worn. 
2. Although summer is coming up, the UK is pretty shit weather wise, will I need all season or Summer? I will be travelling 66 miles a day.
3. Where is the best place to buy?

I'm thinking of creating a justgiving/kickstarter page for Birmingham Updates and I thought I'd ask for your thoughts before doing so. 

Birmingham Updates, as you may or may not know, is a web based source of to the minute news for in and around Birmingham (180k+ likes on Facebook, unsure of the reach via the website etc). It was set up by a chap called Luke Addis in 2011 as a way to give up to date news on the riots, and has evolved to be so much more. Unlike other Birmingham news sources, Birmingham Updates offers highly relevant, no-nonsense updates throughout the day, and for me it's been the go to source for local news.  

I don't know Luke, but I understand he provides the service free of charge, and recently he has posted a couple of things including:

""I absolutely love what I do, but recently I've started to feel the pressure - BU has a following of over 240,000 people - I get around 200 to 400 messages/emails on an average day and I do try to read them but it's just impossible.""

and today he's decided to have a few days break (who can blame him), saying:

""Admin Update - I'm going to take a break for a couple of days. I'm sorry for any inconvenience. Thank you very much for the support. Luke"".

I really want to do something for Luke, and I thought a bit of money through justgiving/kickstarter for him is a decent thing to do.

So I'd like to ask your thoughts on the idea, what do you all think?

If you think it's got legs, I wouldnt be sure how to spread the word to the masses as the Birmingham Updates Facebook page doesn't allow people to post unless it's as a comment. So if you could give me a heads up on that, then that'd be a bonus.

I'm /u/RachelChamberlain, Secretary of State for Equalities and a member of the Labour Party in the Model House of Commons. We're looking both for new members of the subreddit, and also for people who wish to vote in our General Election.

What is the Model House of Commons? It is a subreddit which aims to be an online real life House of Commons, with plenty of opportunities for both fun and politics. There's a massive spread of parties, with a massive spread of views, from far-left communism, to far-right ultranationalism; even those parties which resemble existing ones are massively different from their RL counterparts. I would wholeheartedly suggest you get involved, regardless of political views or affiliations; even if there isn't a party which matches you, you can run as an independent candidate, or alternatively, if you can find enough people, you can start one of your own! It's a great hobby, which really acts to open the mind, and improve your knowledge of how the country works, and your ability to express your views.

Now, why should you join Labour? We're the parliamentary representatives of the 'pragmatic Left'. We do not seek to reinvent the wheel; only make the wheel we already have better. We do not advocate a stateless society, or communal ownership of all property, or other such hallmarks of the far left. Labour are a party of social democracy, a party for justice, equality and wellbeing. We seek not to tear down the foundations on which this country has been built on, but to force the system to serve those who it exists to serve; the people. We seek to make a country where none go hungry, where none suffer because they cannot afford healthcare, where none live as wage slaves to multinational corporations. All this, while maintaining a healthy economy, and a balanced budget.

Does this intrigue you? Or would you rather join an opposing party? Either way, there's a place for you. All you have to do is [join a party](http://www.reddit.com/r/MHOC/comments/2kima2/join_a_party); all the instructions you'll need are on the page. Once you've got that down, start debating!

I've recently left uni and got a graduate job 8-9 months back. (Yay!). I get on with co-workers. Being an ethnic minority in construction industry is painful sometimes though, but I endure and I actually enjoy the ethnic banter that occurs.

This is where things get taken too far. I get on with pretty much 98% of the office. That 2% being fucking Jenny. But anyway, I go to the toilet and one of the guys goes at the same time. Unbeknowst to me he videos me going about my business at the urinal. All fun and games right? No. He literally videos my dick and posts it in our banter whatsapp group. I think I have enough racist dirt in there to get half of my company's engineering department fired, but I digress.

Now, I have no penis shame or any shit like that, but I genuinely feel emotionally tramautized by that event. What/how should I proceed Reddit? UK employment laws taken into account, but it genuinely feels like he committed career suicide there for both of us. I am too ashamed to go back into the office, it's your fucking dick after all, there is a reason you keep that bad boy tucked away. And I am pretty confident soon enough everyone will get a glimpse.

**Legal stuff:** I work full time with an employment contract for the last 9 months. I had a probation for 3 months, which was extended by further 3 months afterwards (as per contract terms) due to my own folly (I fell asleep after pulling an all nighter redoing a piece of coursework). But after 6 months probation I've assumed I am in the clear? As they can only extend it once according to the contract and haven't had a sit down with me. On numerous occasions they've commented on my work progress and integration within a company, it's a construction company - to say that am an ethnic minority is an understatement.

He took the explicit video on a company phone. Posted a still displaying my glory in a whatsapp group with our colleagues.
Another colleague chimed in with a zoomed in shot of my member. Many laughs were had apparently.

I spoke to the HR and have stated that I am not in an emotionally stable state to work and would like to be excused until I am comfortable to return.

Outlined the situation but did not drop any names, for the time being, but it's pretty easy for him to investigate anyway.

What's my position guys? I don't think I will ever be comfortable enough to return to work in that company anymore, in fact the entire industry just seems unappealing after that.

HR guy has stated that in 50 years he worked there he has never encountered a case like that, nor have I tbh.

&gt;**TLDR:** Working class honkeys take shit too far and take a picture of my piece and shares it on whatsapp for the entire company to take a ganter. HR has been notified before I went back to my man cave.


**UPDATE1:**

I got a call back about 2 hours after I left work, the HR director gave me a call and basically ran it down for me:

*They say that the pictures have been deleted off the phones of the 6 Whatsapp participants. - Question is how far does the damage go? And there's never a guarantee that they've all been deleted is basically what I told him.

*He identified the culprit and got him to admit what he did. He said they'll consider what disciplinary action to take but the ""Ball is in my court"".

*Asked me what my plan of action is.

**I told him:**

I am in no position to return and it's nice of him to make promises that everything has been deleted, but there's never a guarantee with modern technology, and chances are the fallout extends beyond the original 6. I am not saying what I am planning to do because I do not know yet, I will need a few days to calm down and I will call him and let him know.

**To Update further:**

I have given a call to the Citizen Advice Bureau, they said an adviser will give me a call back tomorrow, a few friends with minor legal background advised me to go to claims lawyers to see what can happen.

**How I feel:**

I don't feel comfortable returning to the company at all, considering never in the world would I voluntarily show my penis to any guy other than a doctor for medical reasons, and now at least 6 guys have seen it. I don't think there's a future for me there knowing that there are people who I would have never dreamed of showing my penis to have glimpsed it. (Girls with consent - yes, guys big no no)

**What I have:**

Screenshots of the whatsapp chat showing the original picture and a zoomed in one provided by another one of our colleagues.

A week or so ago posted about the HKON Hitbox Casual Cup? 

I spoke to the organisers (friends of mine) about some things some people in this subreddit asked and they clarified some details. 

Their target audience are people like themselves who are under 4kmmr/super casual (like anyone can call themselves casual, sure, but whatever) but they said there are plenty of amateur tournaments around for established teams/players over 4k/5k or whatever, they wanna cater for those that 'wouldn't stand a chance in current tournaments/leagues' i suppose? 

They said if there is enough demand for it though they could organise a more serious one for 4k+ and create a 'casual league' of sorts for the community. 

They just teamed up with dutchdota.com if that's any interest to people here. They're still looking for teams to get involved if there's interest. http://hkon.tv/dota-tournament

So anyone can play providing they're under 4kmmr 

So consider this post another feeler for anyone interested. I know some here were curious but were not sure they'd meet criteria. 


Update:

£100 prizepool now!

And dutchdota.com had this to say (courtesy of Google Translate)

&gt; To even casual players a chance to participate HKON.TV has launched an initiative to a tournament with loot. Each team with an average solo MMR under 4k, can participate in the event that the total prize pool already at ~ € 127, - state.

&gt;Always wanted to get involved in a serious tournament but sit school and work your way to keep up with the real pros? Then this is your chance! The HKON.TV Hitbox Casual Cup, a tournament for casual players, is coming. So call your friends together and register!

&gt;We look forward to this tournament and are very enthused by the idea. If English Dota We are therefore of the party! We have been in discussion with HKON.TV and have offered our services. Our team of casters will provide all matches with commentary! During the English broadcasts, our team will be strengthened by the Swedish Xredoq of the X-League. Matches will be in both English and Dutch language are commented.
To join?

&gt;Then come here since Friday, April 3rd, the first rounds though. You should therefore you subscribe before Sunday, March 29th.

&gt;There are some rules related to the tournament. Thus one of the conditions is that your team consists of casuals. The limit here is drawn as follows: the average solo MMR of your team must be below the 4000. It is permissible to make use of stand-ins for as long as the MMR-limit is still going on.

&gt;It is also important that you designate one person as a team captain. This should act as a contact point and need to arrange any matches. Some prizes will be credited to the PayPal account of the captain.****",false,UKDota,t5_2uyoj,null,null,self,Tournament for under 4kmmr peasants,7,http://www.reddit.com/r/UKDota/comments/2z9ep3/tournament_for_under_4kmmr_peasants/

**Swansea:** Fabianski, Naughton, Amat, Williams, Taylor, Ki, Cork, Shelvey, Sigurdsson, Gomis, Routledge. 

Subs: Britton, Emnes, Dyer, Nelson Oliveira, Montero, Rangel, Tremmel. 

**Liverpool:** Mignolet, Can, Skrtel, Sakho, Sterling, Allen, Henderson, Moreno, Lallana, Sturridge, Coutinho. 

Subs: Jones, Johnson, Toure, Lovren, Gerrard, Lambert, Markovic. 

**Referee:** Roger East.

**1st HALF**

6': **Yellow card for Henderson** for a sliding tackle

7': Liverpool sitting back, Swansea enjoying much of the possession

8': Sturridge lines up a right footed shot across the face of the goal that goes wide. Decent buildup play 

11': Liverpool with careless possession again in midfield, give the ball away. Gomis lines up a threatening shot but well taken care of by Skrtel 

14: Liverpool corner gives way to a speedy Swansea counterattack that sees some last minute, timely blocks

16: Liverpool playing a very slow tempo, and sitting back. Potentially part of the plan for this match.  

17: Swansea pressing high, Liverpool living dangerously in sitting back. 

18: Moreno limping after a tackle. 

19: **Lallana moves to a central area, switching out for Sterling to RW**, with a bit of immediate impact as he lines up a shot from the middle

20: Slow and sloppy play again and back passing inviting trouble, this time down the left. **Skrtel clears a Gomis header**

21: Liverpool have failed to make an so far impression this half, with sloppy back-passes and a slow pace that would have been punished by other teams. 

23: Liverpool scamper back and the defense does reasonably well to clear. 

24: **Stering picks up a Yellow** pulling Routeledge down while tracking back on the right. Prior to that, after our first decent build up play, Sturridge gave the ball away cheaply. 

28: **MISSING PERSONS ALERT: Liverpool Midfield**


29: Some incredible passing between our back 5. 

30: **MIgnolet with an incredible save off Gomis**

33: Swansea with more threatening moveent, this time down the right flank and Sigurdsen hits off balance but doesn't quite get it on target. Liverpool affording a slow pace and plenty of space

36: Incredibly poor passing and an inability to retain posession in the midfield. Credit to Swansea for playing with energy and pressing high. Putting an already nervy Liverpool under even more pressure. 

38: **Another incredible save from Mignolet** after great buildup play. As mentioned, with our lack of pace and the amount of space we're giving up, and no desire to press and win the ball back, we are inviting trouble. 

39: Moreno deflects a Shelvey shot from the resulting freekick. No one was near him when he got taht shot off. Because... 

43: Swansea relatively unlucky to not have converted so far to be fair... they've had the lion share of everything - possession, shots on target, positive passes, energy

45: Liverpool have completeld plenty of passes to their newly signed midfielder wearing 00, Em. T. Space 

**2ND HALF**

47: A few moments of Swansea playing a man down, with Gomis trotting on late

48: Lallana picks up a knock running into a Swansea defender

49: No changes yet, but Gerrard may come on for Lallana. The rain is really coming down 

50: **Moreno picks up a Yellow**

52: Sterling coming off the wing with a nice bit of movement. Better this. 

54: A better passage of play from Liverpool, Liverpool pressing higher up the field and retaining the ball better midfield and up. Tempo is up a bit as well. A corner for Liverpool. 

55: Hendo wins another corner courtesy of a wild shot, collected calmly by Fabianski. Can't blame Hendo from having a go at that range. 

57: Coutinho with a good shot after a great piece of movement. 

59: Can avoids a booking somehow, but Swansea with a free kick from a threatening area... Migs collects it calmly in the end. 

60: Another series of poor back passing results in a corner for Swansea. Ultimately parried away a long distance by Can, to Fabianski on the other end. Sakho looking awful on the ball, not helped by the jeers that he hears each time he's on it. 

61: Liverpool looking a bit brighter and assertive. **Liverpool sub: Gerrard to  for Alberto Moreno** Hendo passes on the armband. Lallana switches to LWB

66: Sturridge hesitates thinking he'd be offisde and decides to not chase a ball down. Shameful. Joe Allen with a shot on target but saved after a decent run of play, Lallana creating a decent amount of pace and movement through the left. 

67: **GOAL: HENDERSON** Well aren't we a bunch of jammy bastards tonight? Fair play to us though we have looked better these last 10 minutes. A lucky deflection/chip. 

72: Liverpool looking more confident now after the goal and with Gerrard's presence. Shelvey with brilliant effort from the sidelines 50 yards out. **Swansea sub: Montero for Routeledge**

76: A lovely curling effort from Coutinho from the Coutinho zone. Following which, Sterling doesn't finish off a fairly easy pass. 

80: **Swansea sub: Nathan Dyer for KISY**

81: Lovely effort from Allen to retain the ball, followed by a guffed attempt at a header from close range from Sturridge. Not looking likely that we'll see the Studge dance this match. 

84: Liverpool fairly dominating the play now, with Gerrard in a pivot role. Allen and Hendo both look tremendously imrpoved after his arrival. 

87: Better from Liverpool in closing down threatening movement, Can and Allen do well to snuff out Swansea. **Liverpool Sub: Glen Johnson for Lallana**

90: Closing in on the win, this really feels like a chess match. If Liverpool hold on for the win, this is a testament to management tactics and switch ups. 

92: 4 minutes of added time. Some time wasting from Liverpool much to the displeasure of the home crowd. 

94: Just not his night Sturridge, after a quick counter from Liverpool, Studge unable to guide the ball past Fabianski on the far post. Swansea throwing everything and Shelvey up. Whistles abound.

But all of those things are what I love about the show--Sara Martins is so captivating, and the perfect complement to the hilariously stiff Ben Miller. And of course it wouldn't be the same show without Dwayne and Fidel. I loved watching the character grow slowly in the first two seasons, and liked the delicate chemistry between the two main characters. The scenery is stunning too. It's not a show I'm absolutely *hooked* on and watch for all the details, but it's still a nice show. I feel like the show had literally just started to establish itself when Miller left :(.

Imagine I own a business with an arbitary income per year (I don't think the amount matters) and I of course use my expenses to offset my tax liabilities.

**Example 1:** If I had an option to get broadband for my business costing £50 a month or £20 a month, assuming the only difference was speed and both were acceptable for my business, should I choose the £50 option because I could get something worthy and could claim £600 tax or should I get the £20 option because I'm not spending much. 


**Example 2:** Assuming a 5* hotel costing £250 is better, why should I not stay at that hotel instead of a 3* hotel costing £50. 

**Example 3:** I want to learn even more about my field of work, why should I buy a book costing £18 when I could go on a course for £900?

Am I doing myself an injustice by not investing more either in me or my business or am I not reading things right?

I was wondering if you could help me reduce the chances of this happening by telling me things I should be looking out for when looking at a place.

Obvious things I can think of are:

- Nearest public transport links
- Nearest supermarket
- Niceness of area
- Comfort of bed

Any help would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks!

Some extra info:

My first bike was some Chinese piece of trash 50cc which I didn't manage to ride once outside so I ended up swapping it for a [Suzuki ER50](http://i.imgur.com/wu5kYxs.jpg?1) which wasn't much better.

When I turned seventeen I bought a [Suzuki GZ125](http://i.imgur.com/pRFJf9j.jpg?1) which looked the dogs bollocks in my opinion but through peer pressure mostly I sold it for a sportier bike.

The sportier bike ended up being this [Hyosung GT125](http://i.imgur.com/G4VJ2A5.jpg?4). Which I loved but my excuse to replace it was that I couldn't touch the floor while sitting on it (I'm a shortarse) so inevitably I had to sell it when I was too nervous because I kept dropping it.

My most recent bike was this [Yamaha TW125](http://i.imgur.com/cFfFYAD.jpg?2) which I've done more miles on than the others combined. It's such a simple bike, rides down my farm track well and was just a great boost to my confidence. But I feel it's lacking.

**21st March 2015: Leicester (H);** Last time we played Leicester at home in the FA Cup it's safe to say it didn't go well.. with a 2-1 loss being recorded. However, I believe at home we're strong and I think we will topple Leicester 2-1, **3 points**

**5th April 2015: Burnley (A)** I'm actually going to this game so I'm pretty stoked as you can imagine! Last time we played Burnley we drew 1-1 in the Capital One Cup and they've just toppled Manchester City 1-0. So with regret I do believe we're going to draw this game as well 1-1. **1 point** 

**11th April 2015: Aston Villa (H)**; Tottenham vs. Tim. Aston Villa are recording goals and Tim is going to want to get one over on us. However, I cannot see them beating us as we have a sparkling record against them not drawing or losing in our last 6 meetings. So a 3-2 win is in order. **3 points**

**19th April 2015: Newcastle (A)**; It's safe to say we're dodge against Newcastle and they're a tricky team. Therefore, it's a draw from me. 2-2. **1 point** 

**25th April 2015: Southampton (A)**; We beat Southampton 2-1 last time we played them but I just can't see it happening again. I want to stretch to a draw and against Southampton I'd take it. 0-0 or 1-1. **1 point** 


**2nd May 2015: Manchester City (H);** We are at home lads and a Gareth Bale/ Jermaine Defoe combo comes to mind. However, Aguero. I don't believe we stand a chance lads so it's a loss for me. **0 Points**

**9th May 2015: Stoke (A)**; Stoke are not the team they use to be and a cold windy night at Stoke is not as scary as it once was. I'm going to go with a 2-1/3-1 win here lads. Nice **3 points**

**16th May 2015: Hull (H)**; A win. They do have a good team cough Tom Huddlestone cough. However, we have the quality to see them off. 2-0 **3 points**

**24th May 2015: Everton (A)**; I'm worried for this one lads, It's a 50/50 and therefore I'm split. I'm going with a 2-2 draw and I'd probably take it. **1 point**

In total this would leave us with 16 points boosting us up to 66 points for the season. Which basically means top 4 is impossible. Which I think it is, we're at the start of Poch's regime and we have a long way to go. But, he shows a lot of potential and I trust him. 

Again, this is my opinion and chances are no one is going to agree with me on every single one! So.. what do you think? What do you think the results are going to be and where do you think we will finish?

The tenants seem trouble-free, and I would like to save costs by managing directly.

On examining the contract, I have discovered that it does not provide any way to terminate my relationship with the agent, while the tenants remain in place. The agent insists that I have to pay them a substantial fee, every year, even if I am managing the property myself.

This seems unfair to me. In fact it seems exactly the same as one of the terms that the High Court found was unfair in the [2009 OFT vs. Foxtons case:](http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20140402142426/http://www.oft.gov.uk/news-and-updates/press/2009/83-09)

&gt; In his judgment given today, Mr Justice Mann accepted that all the terms the OFT brought before the court were unfair, including Foxtons' use of terms:
&gt;
&gt; - requiring a landlord to pay substantial sums in commission, where a tenant continues to occupy the property after the initial fixed period of the tenancy has expired – even if Foxtons plays no part in persuading the tenant to stay, and does not collect the rent or manage the property

Of course, I accept that the agents need to be fairly rewarded for their work in finding me a good tenant, but surely there must be some limit to the amount of money they can charge for that service?

Is this indeed unfair, and if so, what's the best way for me to escape?",false,LegalAdviceUK,t5_32g6u,null,null,self,How can I divorce my letting agent?,0,http://www.reddit.com/r/LegalAdviceUK/comments/2za4ql/how_can_i_divorce_my_letting_agent/

Me and two guys are moving to Edinburgh on the weekend of the 17th of April, we're staying for the next 3.5 years so are looking for a place to rent. 

The issue is it seems the vast majority of rentals seem to be renewing over June/July/August...therefore we're looking for a short term rental between mid-April and the Summer. 

Has anyone got some advice on where to find short term contracts for letting in Edinburgh? Good letting agents, good private landlords etc? We've googled the standard letting company's (rightmove, zoopla, gumtree etc.) and found a couple of options, but nothing ideal by a long shot! We're looking to stay within a 20min walk of the centre/newington/kings building campus, paying up to £1200 pcm.

I've been trying for the past few years to get more into the sport, and I feel like this community here has helped me get further into the sport than I would've imaged a few year ago. This year I've been absolutely gravitating to the games; can't wait to find a stream in the thread(s) to catch the games, find it on TV, etc. Keep in mind I'm an American who's never played a minute of soccer in my life and doesn't know right from left when it comes to formations/tactics/etc. But I'm working on learning more about it (my ""soccer/football literacy"", if you will). 

Why I chose to support Liverpool how many ever years ago is a long story. On top of that I come from a part of the States that's far, far from even seeing soccer as a viable sport on the American cultural landscape. But I couldn't be any more happy with the club I chose to support. It might not be justified since I'm not a native Liverpudlian or Scouser, but I like to think of myself as a mini-Liverpool ambassador among my group of friends. 
Long story short, I just wanted to say thanks to y'all for making my soccer learning experience more enjoyable than it would've been had I've just tried to hack it alone.

I have no idea if they did what they were supposed to do with it (send it to HMRC, I imagine?).

In July I left my employer with whom I was doing the apprenticeship and went to work directly for my training provider (an entirely different business, run by different people) in an unplanned change. Now, as I changed employer I assumed that I should have received my P45 from.. someone.. and then should have given the proper parts to my new employer/training provider. This never happened. Now I'm coming to the end of my apprenticeship and I have no idea what the situation is with my P45 - whether it was ever dealt with by my prior employer, whether my training provider has it, whether I'll have to reapply or what...

I *think* I'll need it when I reapply for JSA in a few weeks, and I know I will if/when I get a job, so what can/should I do about this?

Personally, I live in California though I lived in Kenya when I started supporting the club. I moved from California to Kenya freshman year and watched the 2008 Euros final (Spain v Germany) with some new friends, which was the first match I watched from start to finish. I fell in love with Torres, he scored the winner, where he skinned Lahm for the goal. My best friend at the time supported LFC &amp; told me about everything that had to do with the club and that's really how I got into it. 

So how did others get into supporting the club? 

I know there is some stigma with outsiders supporting these big clubs but sometimes you just can't help it. I'm attached to the club, I follow everything and they have the potential of making my weekend a great or bad one. My dream is to visit Anfield once for a match in my life, hopefully we can all make it there one day. ",false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,null,null,self,How did you become a Liverpool supporter?
