My best friend and I are really itching to travel across the pond to see the boys play at Anfield and I am trying to start planning now for a trip for a long weekend in January.  We would most likely be planning around the Stoke match, which is the 14th of Jan.

I'd love some insight as to making this as easy, affordable, and memorable as we possibly could make it.  What are the best places to stay? How/what sites should we look for tickets, and sitting in what section (Would love the Kop, but not sure if that's viable)? What pubs do you recommend for the nights? Any other attractions we should see while we're there?

What if, and this is a huge what if, the next companion we see with the Doctor ISN'T River?  I mean, River and his relationship is always in reverse right?  That kind of barrier tells me that while she has adventures here and there with the Doctor, she isn't what we would consider a constant companion.  What if the the next Doctor Who companion is in fact a reformed, rebel Silent?  
He does some sort of Tardis Magic (science) that allows his to remember a Silent if that Silent is in the Tardis and boom, he has a new companion.  Supporting Theories:
The Doctor Can't do this for River also so he has her wear an eye patch that has the image of a silent on it so she can remember it.  
The Eye Patch lady is the main villain and learns that the Doctor is using a Silent in the ""War"" against her and figures out she needs to do the same.  
The Silent that appeared at during the season opening at the Lake was in fact invited there because he is the companion Silent. 

I picture the reveal so go something like this: 
The Doctor in the Tardis all morose because he can't do what he told Amy he would do and says out loud, ""Why don't you do something useful instead of just standing in the corner.""

First: ""There's a man who's never going to let you down.""  For a moment, I expected her to go on: ""He's never going to give you up, Melody; he'll never desert you.  He's not a stranger to time ... he knows the rules, and so do I.  He'll never make you cry ... he'll never say goodbye ... ""

Second: If it's Melody Pond, then doesn't that make her Song River?

Third: ""I don't know why you put up with me."" Suddenly whips out long, prehensile tongue over which she has minute motor control that she can wield with pinpoint accuracy.  *\*lesbian couple shares smile\**  Nice little moment that will totally fly over the kiddies' heads.

Fourth: ""Doctor.  The word for healer, and wise man, throughout the universe.  We get that word from you, you know.""  Wait a minute, that's brilliant.  The Doctor IS the Doctor's name?  In other words, when speaking of the etymology, ""the Doctor"" as that Time Lord's name came before ""Doctor"" as the word?

Fifth: ""Who are you?""  Matt Smith's face is BRILLIANT at this point.  The eyes are incredibly dark and he has this outright sadistic smile as he approaches her, intent on absolutely forcing her to identify herself whether or not she resists.  Matt Smith is going to be able to play a Dark Doctor utterly brilliantly, and this convinces me.

And a question: ""I *am* telling you.  Can't you read?""  At this point, the Doctor's **only** looking at the crib.  The little cloth thing's not in play yet.

I'm going to be swamped with work until the 8th, and then I'll be out of town from the 18th onwards with the possibility of moving away, so for 10 days or so, I'll be free in Bristol and I don't want to miss out on anything that might be happening in town at the time as well as checking out some of the suggestions in [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/bristol/comments/it9uq/leaving_bristol_after_4_years_what_to_do/). 

I've also missed out on all the meetups this year, as well as never having been to the Portcullis, so meetup at the pub anytime between 8th-18th??

Ninja Edit: Also, going by the A4 you'll pass [this rockslide](http://g.co/maps/tgmw) covered in graffiti, and looks pretty interesting to warrant a hike on a sunny day. Does anyone know what's up with that and how to get there? An outdated photo of it can be seen [here](http://www.flickr.com/photos/48028479@N00/2941381279/).

Edit2: Will compile a list here.

During a conversation, someone who is currently a health care professional (always been a bit weird, more of an acquaintance than a friend) asked me a question regarding my medical history he really could not possibly have known about.

I obviously don't want to go into details about this medical procedure, however I have literally told nobody about this, and the only other person who knows about this other than myself is my mother so he couldn't have found out any other way. Without wanting to sound melodramatic I'm somewhat shocked and appalled he knows about this and I feel (I think justifiably) upset.

He is excellent at breaking down an opposing counter.

He's starting to hold the ball well, rarely misplaces passes this season, and it seems hes developing a bit of an understanding with bosingwa.

He truly comes to live around the 75 minute mark in games when everyone else's legs begin tiring, but for some crazy reason he just faster.

He now adds a whole new dimension to our attack from deep, his two runs today were a real spark to the game. 

He covers so much goddamn ground out there.

I didn't realise it but things were off from the beginning - they wanted us to show them our student card, to prove we were students. Neither I nor the others had planned on going out so we were not dressed smartly, but we fit in.

We go in, buy some drinks at the bar, stand around and then decide to sit down. I am not quite sure what happens afterwards, there is some wax spilled on the table and suddenly there is like 3 bouncers swarming around us. They ask us to leave, not politely, and won't say why. When we are too slow they grab our drinks, chuck them out, take the smallest guys put him in a headlock and throw him out. Make the rest of us leave.

The rest of us leave, but not without protesting and I may or may not have given them the finger when I left. Didn't say anything, or complain, but maybe gave them the finger. 

One of the lads I am with tries to talk to them, but the bouncers are adamant we are not going back in, their main reason being I gave them the finger (I used international language and not the English way of doing it.) Either way, I did rise to the bait and end up giving them the finger because I was furious. 

This is the only time I have been disappointed by Liverpool. 

I also made a police report, but I doubt that will solve anything.

So I'm looking at general budgets, to maybe see if people think its all affordable and what-not (guess I'm just having the nerves of hoping I've not agreed to 6 months of potentially struggling with money)!
I earn around £28k a year, after all tax and student loans I take home around £1.7k a month. 

The flat I'm about to rent is in Warwickshire at £575 a month, but with nothing included. Council tax looks around £75 after the 25% discount for being on my own, contents insurance maybe around £15, TV License around £10 , then there will be interenet+phoneline (Possibly around £20-£30) and on top of that Water and Electric (no gas though). 

I also have a car but don't drive more than 3 miles or so to work so I only fill it up maybe once a month (£40-£50), but insurance and tax is going to put me back around £80 a month average. 

In all, if I budget around £275 for all bills a month (I don't include the car with this budget, thats an ""extra"") that puts me around £850 a month, which is bang on 50% of my take home earnings.
Does this all seem sensible? What sort of money a month do you guys pay after rent, is a £575 a month rent for my salary reasonable, or do you think I'm possibly going to regret this (its 6 month contract, then I can either carry it on or leave). I feel 50% is quite a lot to spend but it covers all bills, and if your renting a place as an individual...well if this is too much its back to living in a shared place or moving out into the sticks...

What if....

That ""punish those who've yet to be punished"" group are with those who are at an ongoing war with the Doctor, and the entire point of all of this was to punish the doctor. Not to kill him, or to cause him physical pain, but instead, to make him feel guilty and awful and hate himself even more than he already does. That would explain why the pandorika kept the person inside alive - it would make him reflect on his past. It was a prison, but also a torture chamber.

When the young Amy voice interface in the Tardis said 'Fish fingers and custard'- The very first thing to cross my mind was the night of her first meeting with the Doctor... 
He showed up in her back yard in a crashed and wounded Tardis- desperate and insisting that he needed something... Almost like he was trying to find a cure to some terrible ailment...  I assumed at the time (as I'm sure we all did) that whatever he needed was due to his regeneration... But now I'm thinking that he might have gone back (thus creating a mind-blowing time paradox) to find a cure (or at least some temporary relief) for the poison kiss.

Then, I would sell Crouch and Palacios to Stoke for around £18mil, maybe a bit less if they're playing hardball. To fill the DM role, I would try to get Lassana Diarra for around £12mil. Next, I'd try to sell Hutton and Bassong for around £5mil each, and then buy someone like Christoper Samba, Ryan Shawcross, or Gary Cahill to fill in at CB. To raise a bit more money, I would sell Jenas and Gomes because I think they're surplus to requirements. Finally, I would sell Dos Santos and maybe Defoe or Pavlyuchenko and buy Leandro Damião, demanding him now and not at the end of their season, even if it costs extra. I would also go for another striker, maybe Guiseppi Rossi or Hulk.

Also, I would like to see us change from the usual 4-4-2/4-4-1-1 formation we're playing. In particular, I'd like to see us play 5-3-2/3-5-2, with Bale and Walker/Corluka playing wing back, moving between midfield and defense.

Let's take a look at some of the spoilers and discuss, shall we? They seem to all be confirmed, but as a cynic I wouldn't put trust in that. I will mark some with notes (**they will look like this*)

***I will mark the ""dangerous"" spoilers with a spoiler tag***

**Warning, it's long!**

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-It's confirmed that series 4 will have 13 episodes.

-The knights remain around even though some people are surprised with Arthur's choice of knights which brings about some tension.

-Uther is broken so Arthur takes a bit more of control.

-Quite dramatic things await Gwen and Morgana.

-There won't probably be as many comic episodes as in previous seasons.

-There's camaraderie, friendship and respect between the Great Dragon and Merlin, they help each other out.

-Changing the format so Arthur knows about Merlin's magic would completely change the dynamic of the show and it doesn't sound like a good idea to the producers since to them it was never about Arthur finding out. (**boo.*)

-There's huge changes for Merlin in Series 4. It is clear that Camelot is heading in a new direction and the characters' arcs are starting to take their place.

-Colin doesn't think the reveal will happen quickly or will be resolved quickly.

-Series 4 starts a year after the end of series 3 and it's going to be darker. Merlin is going to be challenged and we may have a glimpse of his darker side. (**IMO this is good.*)

[spoiler](/s""-Morgause will be back (she was originally stated to die though), but Johnny Capps wouldn't say whether they're going to delve into her birth/childhood. (**I believe I read somewhere else that she will be brought back within the first two eps.*)"")

-The new cast arrival [Nathaniel Parker as Agravaine] is a relative of Ygraine.

-Morgana is harder, stronger, powerful and committed and she's accepted who she is. She has entirely changed in the year away, been out of Camelot and probably been hunted having to hide who she is.

-A year has also passed with everyone knowing that she is magical, so that's also going to have changed how everybody else views her and how she views herself.

[spoiler](/s""-Gwen has been looking after the king in the year that Morgana's been away."")

-Gwen's relationship with Arthur becomes more open.

-Agravaine is a dark and brooding presence at court.

-Arthur doesn't suspect he is a baddie, only Gaius at the beginning and then Merlin too.

-He tries to give him the best advice he possibly can. He would run Camelot in a very different way if he had a chance (in an old guard fashion vs Arthur's new guard one) using more strength. He's a force to be reckoned with.

-Even though Morgana is not living in Camelot any longer, the writers find ways around for her to still interact with everyone in Camelot.

-Series 4 is the most grown up so far and everyone's path is starting to become clear as we know it from the legends.

[spoiler](/s""-Prince Arthur will reign as regent instead of Uther."")

-Uther's legacy is important and there interesting stories around him.

-More CGI armies. (**Hooraayy..*)

-Opening two parter is about Morgana trying to get her revenge on Camelot. She does quite an extreme thing and the question is if Arthur and Merlin will be able to defeat her.

-Since the knights are a constant presence, there'll be a lot more action/adventure quest stories.

-Stories will revolve around Morgana, Gwen, Arthur, Merlin and the Knights. Episodes are more serialised, more focus on main cast despite guest stars of the week will still be coming.

-Some aspects of the legend still to come.

-They are going to do Arthur/Gwen/Lancelot in their own way.

[spoiler](/s""-Morgause's face is scarred on the left side. She won't just sit and lick her wounds."")

-Instead of having comedy episodes, it's very much about having lightness and darkness within episodes.

-Tag line for series 4 has changed from ""The Search For Emrys"" to ""The Darkest Hour is Just Before The Dawn"". They are nearing the dawn of Camelot's golden age. (**Aw no. That sounds so fun.*)

[Spoiler](/s""-Merlin's duplicity between his young and his old version (Dragoon the Great as seen in 3x10 ""Queen of Hearts"" becomes part of series 4. his magic will be found out is a huge part of the next series. There are other people who want to know who he is, we get to learn about the legend of Emrys, and there bigger and more important reasons why he can't reveal his identity yet and why he needs to keep his magic secret. (**Yeech.*)"")

[spoiler](/s""-Gwen won't cheat on Arthur but they will get through some obstacles in their way."")

[spoiler](/s""-Morgana will return, and her magic is just as strong as Merlin's. (**Dislike.*)"")

-Merlin's story arc will see him finding his true place in the court of Camelot.

-The knights will be a strong unit in series four. Arthur and Lancelot get their swords out a lot. (**Of course.*)

-Uther has had to face up too his past actions, and the repercussions will continue in series four.

[spoiler](/s""-Uther will never give up his crown to Arthur, but admits that a ""battle for power"" will occur between the father and son."")

[spoiler](/s""-Lancelot gets to meet the dragon. (**Does he get to ride it?*)"")

-Morgana gets to blast a guy against a wall. 

-The fourth series will be ""more filmic"" and will feature more ""epic, vast, magical landscapes"" with more green-screen shooting.

-Merlin has a lot in his plate at the moment for romance. (**Haha!*)

[spoiler](/s""-We see Old Merlin as he is in the future, not Merlin using him as a disguise but we see him as he will actually be in 60 years. (**I dislike old Merlin :(*)"")

[spoiler](/s""-Emrys is a very large presence to Morgana. She doesn't know who he is but she is fearful of him and a driving force for her throughout series four. Her need to discover who he is and ultimately vanquish him is a big part of what she does going forward. (**Yes, this is what I wanted.*)"")

**Here are some particularily specific ones:**

-Series 4 has a serial feel to it so episodes aren't as stand-alone. There's no going back. Each episode takes a progression as a piece of a jigsaw that has to be completed. There's no reverse going on.

-Merlin is discovering more and more how lost he is and the he finds out, the more he loses. While everyone else is slotting into place, he finds himself wondering where he fits and he's never fitted in. [spoiler](/s""When family ties and loyalty and royalty overrule friendship, that's a big blow to him."") Throughout the series, Merlin's very much left in a limbo.

-Merlin is gonna struggle keeping his friendship with Arthur going on but he is met with a wall and he's not sure how to deal with that. Despite there's the usual Merlin and Arthur banter, it's just not always appropriate.

[spoiler](/s""-The first two episodes are terrifying and play on that childhood fear of the dark. Some things that have been unleashed from a split in the veil between the real world and the underworld come out at night."")

-The knights or the Round Table are back with a strong feel that they are a band coming together.

-Lancelot is back and there's a really good twist concerning the Arthur/Gwen/Lancelot love triangle, the most obvious Arthurian reference in the show so far. (**Meaning sexytime, is my guess.*)

[spoiler](/s""-The big upset and the big fear that Merlin has is a reincarnation of Uther in Arthur: if there's any sign that Arthur is thinking like Uther's thinking, then he can never bring his magic to the fore. He can never get that kingdom he wants to have. (**Not sure what this means.*)"")

-There is a big focus on Uther because he's losing his mind. He's a ghost of himself but still firmly grasped on his mindset of rules that are still in there from years and years of hatred.

-There are gonna be more clashes between Merlin and Morgana than ever with epic battles.

-Morgana has a paranoia of Emrys. [spoiler](/s""She doesn't know who this is. She keeps having visions of an old man called Emrys. She doesn't know it's Merlin in the future."") We get glimpses of the future, the genuine future, of what's to come right from the beginning.

-There's an episode that focuses solely on dragons and the future of the dragons.

[spoiler](/s""-Merlin and Gwen remain very good friends. There's an episode where he really needs her help and they go off on a mission together."")

-No wardrobe change for Merlin at all this season although we get to see him as a Knight of Camelot briefly. (**LOL**)

-------------------------------------------------------------------

~These are a bit tame, there were other spoilers I found that apparently were confirmed (if my memory serves well) and yet I cannot find where I found them, so I have quite forgotten them. However I remember clearly that it stated that Morgana will indeed find out about Merlin's secret, along with some other things. Then again, there is another spoiler that states that Morgana *won't* find out about Merlin's magic.. Hm... I wish I could find that list..

Still, be forewarned. 

Rory and the Doctor had a talk, in which he mentioned that he sometimes remembers the 2000 years he spent as The Last Centurion. (TLC - taking care of Amy in the Pandorica.  Cute.)  Um, wait. I thought that was a Nestene plastic duplicate, not Rory. WTF? Rory says the memories come and go, which has to be messing with him something fierce. _Are_ they coming or going, or is Rory resisting it, suppressing them as he tries to hang on to his identity? 

But rewatching The Pandorica Opens, I have to wonder how much the 'universe reboot' actually changed things. Did Amy have a lot more influence there then we were led to believe? Her remembrance (remembering? rememorification?) brought the Doctor back... did her memory of Rory as TLC influence his basic nature? 

I'm not saying he might still be plastic. That opens up a whole can of worms with River being half-human, half-Time Lord, and half-plastic. Walking away from that thought _right now._  Rather, I'm wondering if Amy remembering him as a two thousand year old warrior has actually made Rory that much of a badass? 

In Let's Kill Hitler, Amy is surprised by the fact that quiet, country nurse Rory knows how to drive a vintage motorcycle. He says 'it's that kind of day.' As in, he's having one of those days where he remembers the centuries of accumulated skills he'd acquired? It would explain the ease with which he knocks out that Nazi, and the evident skill and familiarity he had with that handgun when he pointed it at Hitler. 

If that's the case, it means Rory is gradually integrating those 'new' memories and skills, accepting them and growing more comfortable using them. And if so... then I'm looking forward to the day when The Doctor lays down a 'because I said so, dammit, and since I'm nine hundred years old I'd appreciate it if you had a little respect for the opinions of your elders!' only to have Rory stare him down and remind him 'Nine hundred? Please. I'm more than twice your age, sonny.

I do agree with Harry that out pre-season has been crap. Thats because its nothing but speculation, mind-games and garden path statement. Then again Harry seems to know almost 0 about the modric situation, it was only last week it most people got the opinion he wanted modric sold, replaced, and other part of the squad strengthened with the proceeds.

Roll all this up, and bundle it together with the usual media speculation, a manager that seems to have few answers about who is coming and going, and you have nothing more than team full of players who have entirely unsettled, confused and pissed off.

I do think things should improve from Wednesday onwards though, but they need to get some deals in just to placate people now. If I was a spurs player hearing about all these deals being done (as stated by the manager, on behalf of the chairman) and the window closed 2 loans, and a free trasnfer goalkeeper being the major additions. I would be sat asking ""What the fuck is wrong with these people."" How are they going to prove to the likes of Modric, Bale, VdV etc that they are serious about competing when they are dragging everything out and paying mickey mouse with signings.

I think after River/Melody gave up her regenerations to the Doctor, the Doctor felt bad, he loves her and she cant spend forever with him cause she can't regenerate. 

SO the Doctor will go back in Rivers/Melodys time line, back when she was still in the spacesuit. And the Doctor will get a flesh version of him to go and use himself as bait for the younger River/Melody to kill him. Thus completing Melodys mission and allowing her to become River and not have to kill the Doctor.  

Then River can regenerate and spend forever with the Doctor. 

The whole Flesh Doctor as bait is backed up by the fact that, the first Doctor we see (allegedly 1103) in the first episode, doesn't have the TARDIS, but has a car and that one is the Flesh Doctor. So the normal Doctor (who has the TARDIS) just waits until Flesh him is dead. Then he acts clueless as to why he was ""recruited"" and says he is 909.

So I went back and am rewatching ALL of season 5 again and so far have found a lot of little off hand remarks and such that may have a bearing in the rest of season 6.

For instance.  There is a reference to the Silence in the ""Vampires of Venice"" that I completely forgot about.  As well as a number of things said by Father Octavian in ""Angels"".  And I think we've missed a MAJOR clue in ""Amy's Choice"".  I have some ideas but I don't know, it's a possibility.  Either way I'd it would be a good idea to go back through and see if you all catch more.

I'm about to watch ""The Lodger"" again and see what can be learned from that one as well. ;)

I think there were one or two more mentioned in LKH, but haven't gotten around to my second viewing yet to double check.

So, can anyone elaborate on some others?

I'll update here as more are posted.

**So far we have:** 

* 1: The Doctor lies.
* 7: Never run when you are scared.
* 27: Never knowingly be serious.
* 54: Anything can come from outside of the universe, but nothing can come from before the universe.
* 408: Time is not the boss of you.
* Never get involved in the affairs of other times/worlds (Unless there's a child crying)
* Time can be rewritten.
* Don't step on any butterflies. What have butterflies ever done to you?
* Don’t make height jokes around a Sontaran
* Make sure you always have pockets
* Don't let me eat pears. I hate pears.
* The Doctor is in charge. Also: Don't wander off.
* He's not the Professor, he's the Doctor.
* No one deserves to be sacrificed
* Never ignore a coincidence. Unless you are busy. Then always ignore a coincidence.
* Never cross your own personal timeline, except for cheap tricks
* Always learn names.
* The Doctor is not allowed to see inside the book.
* ""There's one thing you never put in a trap. If you have any plans about seeing tomorrow, there's one thing you never, ever put it a trap:  Me.""
* You always have a choice.

When Time Lord society was functioning, there was a limit to the number of regenerations anyone could have. Since this obviously has to go away or the show will end soon and 11 didn't say 12 when he was asked how many times he could regenerate (SJA), I thought that meant there was no limit anymore. When he told Clyde he could do it 500 times, I thought that was mainly a way to shut up an annoying kid, not to establish a limit. 

It seems to me that if there is a limit of 500, that is a lot more than you would need to make someone recover from being poisoned to death. When 5 was poisoned, he recovered with just one regeneration (and a nasty case of regeneration sickness).  I can understand a loss of energy efficiency if you have to transfer regenerations, but it doesn't make sense that it would take 498 regenerations worth of energy to restore The Doctor. This must mean there is a limit and it isn't much higher than it was originally.

Then again, since regeneration energy comes in the form of packets stored in a Time Lord's body (Mawdryn Undead) that can be added or subtracted, maybe a TARDIS can manipulate the number of regenerations in a Galifreyan Time Lord, but not in a human.

First artist I would like to recommend is a personal friend. An awesome drinking buddy if you ever make it round to his local and a genuine nice guy.

Alex, aka Umber, is a one man band with a very ambient and folk vibe. If, like myself, you are a fan of Sigur Ros or solo accoustic guitar then this album will fit in perfect in your music collection.

Not only does Umber stop at being an awesome drinking buddy, a great artist, he also has a wonderful way of distribution. You can download for ""pay what you want"", and in various formats, including FLAC, at [http://umber.bandcamp.com/ ](http://umber.bandcamp.com/)

Not only that, but you can buy a physical copy of the CD which is handmade and includes a link to a digital download at 
[http://umber.bigcartel.com/](http://umber.bigcartel.com/) (and comes in either ivory or lilac, depending on where in your cd collection it will sit :) Mine currently sits in the car and in regular rotation)

And Alex doesn't stop there. To get his creative juices flowing he has a tumblr blog where he uploads new tracks on a weekly basis. [http://umberjourney.tumblr.com/](http://umberjourney.tumblr.com/)

Even if he wasn't a friend I'd recommend Umber till the cows come home, and there's plenty of cows around his neighbourhood. Not just for using a host of distribution methods but just for simply having beautiful music that is a joy to listen to.

Go buy his album. It's worth all the £4 (and a helluva lot more) of what it costs.

If you're still unsure after my words go check out his blog and music video [http://www.soundsofumber.co.uk/](http://www.soundsofumber.co.uk/)",false,nottingham,t5_2qmbu,null,null,self,"Local Music Artists ""Umber - Morning Pass (EP)""",3,http://www.reddit.com/r/nottingham/comments/jy2e1/local_music_artists_umber_morning_pass_ep/

So, what do we know so far?

* mels, melody, was a childhood friend of rory and Amy.  It's not known whether she's always been there and they simply never mentioned her, or she got ""retconned"" into amy's life.

* the girl in the orphanage was (most likely) river, mels is her first or second regeneration.  In 1969, melody from the orphanage becomes mels, things happen, and she grows up alongside her parents without anyone being confused by her lack of aging.

* hints are dropped that river can control her aging process, although nothing concrete.

* river killed the doctor on lake silencio.  Obviously, I don't expect the explanation to be that simple, but the justice department said that river song killed the doctor on lake silencio on April 24, 2011, and that this is a fixed point.

* the justice department is some organization, that has the ability to travel through time, and hunt down ""bad guys.""  Some speculation about the justice department being connected to the time agents from harkness' time.

* the silence is not a race of aliens, but a religious movement that attempts to answer the oldest question in the universe.  Their prophesy is ""silence will fall when the question is ~~answered~~ asked.""

* doctor's clothing choices: at the beginning of the episode, the doctor is shown wearing a big trenchcoat, then he returns to normal at some point, and then sometime between him hearing ""fish fingers and custard"" and him showing up again in 1938, he changes into a tuxedo, similar to the one from Amy/rory's wedding. (~~does he have the scarf at any point?  Doesn't he intentionally put the scarf down at some point during the big bang?~~)
He definitely has the scarf at the beginning of the wedding, takes it off to dance, has it again when he leaves the reception and talks to river (where he also asks who she is), and then hangs it on something on the TARDIS console when he enters.  Begin forming your theories on that, if you want.

* on the topic of ""fish fingers and custard,"" the question has to be brought up again, did that timeline ever happen?  They never told us after the doctor is brought back, if any of the previous timeline ever happened.

* the doctor says *something* to river song that gets the response, ""I'm sure she already knows.""

* River sacrifices her remaining regenerations to save the doctor.  Insinuated that there are a concrete number of regenerations, but it could just as easily be that she sacrificed her power of regeneration to save him.

* food for thought: river was taken by the silence and kovarian, which use the same logo as the soldiers in flesh and stone, and the soldiers there identify themselves as a religious organization, so it's not too much of a leap to assume that the soldiers in flesh and stone were part of the silence.  However, River is in her final regeneration in that episode, meaning she has met the doctor, almost killed him, and gave her lives for him already.  She is shown with a new looking diary at the school at the end of LKH, but her diary in flesh and stone is older.  So the question is, where does flesh and stone take place on river's timeline, and why are the silence still there during it?  Why don't they try to kill the doctor on sight?  The CO even helps the doctor at the end.  I'll have to rewatch flesh and stone after I finish watching LKH again.

My question is, do we know for sure there have only been 11 Dr's?  My meaning to this is we know the Dr is 900+ years old, and we have had about 50 years of story for him.  I know quite a bit of the Dr's 900 years would have happened off screen, but do we know for sure that what we have known as the 1st Dr is in fact the first version of him?  And if so, how old was he when he regenerated?  

I know time lords age differently, and the 1'st Dr was a much older man than current Dr's.  We have also seen the Master as a child, so we can assume there is some form of linear aging in the first generation.  So are we to accept that the first elderly Dr meant that the first generation lived far longer than what we have seen since?  Or is it more likely, he is just the form that got taken from a previous regeneration?

I know there is a whole big debate about the 13 regeneration limit, but if that gets thrown out the window, doesn't that lead to there having been many more versions of the Dr throughout time?",false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,null,null,self,How do we know for sure we are on the 11th Dr,0,http://www.reddit.com/r/doctorwho/comments/jyaaq/how_do_we_know_for_sure_we_are_on_the_11th_dr/

The Impossible Astronaut IS the Doctor!  Notice how the ""gun"" used to kill him had the same green hue as his sonic screwdriver?  Maybe, he's done something to make two of himself or he's using the suit to do something wibbley-wobbley to time to allow him to be in two places at once, so he doesn't break time since it's a fixed point.  Also a possibility, River's blamed because of what the Silence did to her and because of her attempt to kill him in LKH (since the Time Police don't see her revive him), and she takes full blame for it, otherwise the Doctor's plans would fail.  Or maybe, he had her get in the suit and kill him.  Remember, the Doctor lies.  He could even be lying about his death.

On a side note, now that we are seeing new River, kind of makes me yearn for the River of old, (Classic River).  The problem with the opposite timelines is that as we begin to know River more and more, she becomes less and less the River that we know (that make sense? not sure).  We are seeing her from the Doctor's POV, so she will be less and less the River of the Library or of the Return of the Angels, each time.  How do others feel about this?

After LKH, and seeing speculation concerning Amy's wedding in The Big Bang, I had to go watch that episode. I just wanted to bounce a few ideas around and see what you all think.

Enter: The Wedding.  Amy is sitting at the head of her table after the wedding. Out the window, she sees River. River gives her a look, almost one of recognition. That's all River does, walk by. Amy Pond begins to remember the Doctor. Amy begins to cry, wonders why, Rory gives her River's journal, someone had left it for them. **Side note: We often see the Doctor placing the clues in the past that lead directly to success/survival in the future, such as, writing a warning note, implanting a memory, leaving his screwdriver. Perhaps the journal at the wedding and the journal he puts beside ""Melody's"" hospital bed are related in this way**

Continuing on, she remembers with clues around the room. Goes on about the story she told him about her raggedy Doctor. The Doctor arrives *instantly*. **Side note: ""Something old, something new, something borrowed, something blue"" are the words Amy Pond uses to bring the Doctor to her. Where are they from?**

When he gets out of the TARDIS, the Doctor doesn't look anxious, or immediately happy; but looks surprised, alert, and distracted. **Side note: He would be happy if he specifically took the TARDIS to Amy's Wedding; knew his destination, right? All we know is he has some sort of interaction with UI interface of the TARDIS back in LKH. He doesn’t want Rose, Martha, or Donna. He needs Rose. Somehow, the UI changes, and says, “Fish fingers and custard.” The Doctor yells, “Custard!” and disappears. Perhaps this caused the TARDIS to take the Doctor to Amelia's wedding.**

He finds something for the pain; he lands, puts on his tuxedo, and heads out.

They then have a bit of an exchange: ""Ok, Doctor, did I surprise you this time?"" Doctor: ""Oh yeah, never expected that, completely astonished. How lucky am I to be wearing this old thing [tuxedo]?"" They dance. The Doctor reminisces while watching Amy and Rory dance. 

Enter: The Doctor without the boutonnière skipping towards the TARDIS. River confronts him, ""Did you dance? Well, you always dance at weddings, don't you?"" The Doctor replies, ""You tell me."" River responds, ""Spoilers!""

The significance of this exchange remains in the fact that the Doctor seemingly didn't know if he danced at the wedding. With the order of shots in The Bing Bang, I assume we're expected to think that he just came from that wedding. Why doesn't he remember dancing? Is this boutonnière-less Doctor from a different section of the timeline? Did he just lose his boutonnière dancing the crazy giraffe? Idk. lol. 

He then gives River her *journal* and swears he didn't peek. Doctor asks, ""Are you married?"" She says, ""Yes."" Then the Doctor stumbles around and says he didn’t mean, implicitly: will you marry me. She still says, ""Yes."" So this River is far enough in the future to know that the two are married, and this Doctor isn’t that old.

The Doctor asks, ""River, who are you?"" River says, ""You're going to find out very soon; and I'm sorry; but, that's when everything changes."" River blinks away with her time-agent, time travel device.

So how soon is that? Soon as in, roughly 1 season from then when they read the crib in AGMGTW , or, within 32 minutes when he climbs into the TARDIS and get back to Berlin? **Side note: Perhaps he doesn't ‘find out’ her identity, per say; but, learns something new about their overall, time-spanning relationship when she gives up her lives to bring the Doctor back? But then, maybe we’re thinking to Doctor-centric. Maybe it’s when the Doctor learns about River’s sacrifice and when River’s life completely changes due to lost regeneration?**

Back in LKH, we arrive at the scene, in which, “Melody” has piloted the TARDIS to save Amy and Rory and take them back to the Doctor. The Doctor, on death’s knell, tells “Melody” something to which Mel responds, “I’m sure she already knows.” Based on her willingness to give the Doctor her regeneration, I think that the Doctor told Melody that he loves River Song. Once the time-agent robot shows Melody that she is, in fact, River Song, she gets it and decides to sacrifice to save the Doctor. **She is, supposedly, the one who kills the Doctor; but, also the one that saves him.**

 **Side note: That robot. I’m thinking it’s time agent time agent. The wrist contraption they all wear looks a lot like the contraption River and Captain Jack use to travel through time. The Doctor also has quite a bit of distaste towards the robot when he finds out where it’s from/who’s piloting it; similar, to the distaste he exhibits when he finds out Jack Harkness is a time agent.** 

Something to note, I think this is probably the origin of, “Hello Sweetie”. I think it’s the edgy, promiscuous “Melody” coining that phrase, not “Melody” remembering herself to be River Song in some sort of glorious enlightenment. 

I’m still trying to work out how all of this relates; but, I think there are some pretty good ideas involving The Big Bang and Let’s Kill Hitler, the robot’s identity, the Doctor’s death, the ending of The Big Bang, and a few other things.

Ok, now that is out of the way... I want to talk about regenerations.

Basically, River uses up all of her regenerations to bring back the Doctor. It has been brought up that time lords are only allowed/able to regenerate twelve times (still all up in the air). By giving her regenerations to the Doctor, is he now able to regenerate x-more times?

Also, is it safe to say that x is ten? As I figure, Melody started off as a baby (obviously) and grew up into a toddler who then mysteriously was dying (perhaps from being shot or something...). Then right before dying, she regenerated into presumably Mels whom she lived as until she was shot by Hitler and regenerated into River. Thus, Melody only went through two regenerations.

So with that in mind, can the Doctor now regenerate a total of twenty-two times? Or is the magic number still twelve and it just takes the power of ten regenerations to revive a time lord?

In other words, assuming a time lord is allowed/able to regenerate 12 times...

12 - 10 = 2 remaining regenerations for the Doctor

12 - 2 = 10 remaining regenerations for Melody

2 + 10 = 12 new remaining regenerations for the Doctor

### New Mod
I'd like to introduce a new mod to /r/doctorwho - HazzW. He's been added because our userbase has increased to ridiculous proportions, and he's always been helpful to this subreddit. I haven't been able to change the background of this subreddit for quite some time as I have not been able to access Reddit from a computer till, well, now. Let's welcome HazzW, who is now officially the mod for almost every DW related subreddit.

### Spam
Our spam levels have gone thru the roof, and it is getting to be a lot of work. So, here is how the spam queue will be checked: HazzW will check the spam queue during GMT times (I believe he/she/it is a Brit), and I'll check during GMT+10/11 times (since I am based in Australia). It'll be like taking shifts, so if you suspect your post is being held in the spam queue, Don't Panic, and have your towel next to you - it has not been EXTERMINATED yet. 

### Weekly episode discussions
From now on, there will be a weekly post for the discussion of episodes, PLEASE DO NOT USE OTHER THREADS. I'll leave it to HazzW to to fix up that floating bar thingy like he did on the Torchwood subreddit.

### Spoiler Policy
It will be expected that 48 hours after an episode has aired, dedicated Whovians like you would have watched it - so until 48 hours has passed, use [SPOILERS] to indicate that the link/self post you posted contains spoilers about the current episode. After 48 hours, you can feel free to not bother about using spoiler tags.  
This however, does not negate the NO SPOILERS IN TITLE rule. Don't post spoilers like ""Bad Wolf was manipulated by the Silence all along"" in the title. 

This however, is debateable, and you guys should debate this.

Bullshit, we said, unlimited by definition means as much as we want.  The rep eventually got the message that we would not be ""persuaded"" into giving up more cash and gave up.

Two days ago, my father received an e-mail saying he had used up 75% of his 2gig broadband allowance.

So now my dad is having to go through all his paperwork, trying to find the original contract to disprove these fuckers and get the service he signed up for.

This is a blatant cash-grab by an organisation which already has its reputation in the shitter.  Can anyone enlighten me as to the legality of this?  Has this happened to anyone else?

I don't know if there is a precedent for Timelord having large change in age while regenerating, however the implication is that there is still the possibility for a pre ""Impossible astronaut"" and very much brain washed version of River (by her timeline) to regenerate into the child form we saw in TIA.

Or course, there is still the problem of Mels indicating that LKH is the first time she meets the doctor. Still brainwashing or memory editing (which I am sure a villains is capable of doing if their master plan is turning a child into a weapon) could allow some sidestepping of that.

I told a major (I mean he can name the first and last episodes of classic Who writers) Whovian, because he can always convince me and use analytical reasoning. I said: Why should I like Rose?

He said something along the lines of: ""What you must remember is that in a way, Rose is the most unique companion the Doctor has had. To put it plainly, most of the Doctor's companions are nerds. Nerdville. Geekcentral. Even Peri in her bikini was what, a BOTANIST. So then comes along Rose.""

And then my friend, with six words, changed the way I thought about Rose. Just six words.

""Rose is our first 'cheerleader' companion.""

She is a bit of what we could consider to be ""chavvy"" and she becomes a geek thanks to the Doctor. It's an interesting new light for me in which to think of Rose. Now it doesn't mean I instantly like Rose. I'm going to have to go rewatch some episodes and do some thinking, but it definitely makes me dislike her less. I thought people would be interested in this experience of mine.

I have a serious qualm with the current season of Doctor Who. In my opinion, the current season doesn't have many stand-alone episodes that I can just watch and enjoy regardless of the episodes before it or after it. I have always felt that that has been a strong point of the new Doctor Who (I haven't seen enough classic Doctor Who episodes to be able to add it to this). There are so many episodes that if I feel like watching Doctor Who, I can just put on and enjoy, say Smith and Jones, or The Water of Mars, or The Girl in the Fireplace, etc, without thinking or needed to know all the background of the previous episodes around it. 

This current season is mostly about the overall plot of the season, and so much is tied into it, it is hard to randomly watch one episode out of order. I was really hoping Let's Kill Hitler would be a more light-hearted adventure, with only some light touching of the overall season plot. Especially after the very heavy previous episode, A Good Man Goes to War, there were so many revelations and plot twists, that I wanted an episode to just have fun and not worry too much about the big picture. I would have enjoyed maybe a plot where the Doctor accidentally saves Hitler's life, and then, to keep the timeline correct, has to protect Hitler and stop the Time-traveling, Robot-driving, Time Police from killing Hitler (or something better than that). Instead there were more twists and less fun time travel and monsters. 

At the same time, I also enjoy the huge, season dominating plot line, because it is fun to get so tied into every episode, trying to catch the whole story. It's so easy to get caught up in the twist and turns of Moffat's twisted mind. It seems like every time we seem to know what's going on, the next episode throws everything for a loop. I just wish the plot wasn't so dominating every episode.

I'm an American who's getting married in roughly five weeks in Scotland (near Blairgowrie) and will be spending a few days in Edinburgh before flying to Paris. I've researching restaurants in Edinburgh but wanted local opinions on a few places that looked really interesting. My fiance is essentially leaving me to book whatever I want, but as we'll only be there for five days (not including the wedding side trip) I want to make them as delicious as possible. Essentially, I'm looking for an upscale dinner and maybe doing a lunch at one of the pricier restaurants as well. My fiance is also a vegetarian but so far it seems that Edinburgh is a lot more vegetarian-friendly than the US. London was a dream - he could find several options in every restaurant we tried. It's a struggle where we live (Florida) so I want to make it good for him, too. 

For dinner, I was looking at [The Witchery](http://www.thewitchery.com/home.html) but another Redditor in r/travel said it was pretty gimmicky (but still tasty), so would that perhaps be better for lunch?  I was also looking at [Wedgwood](http://www.wedgwoodtherestaurant.co.uk/content/40/seafood.htm), [Castle Terrace](http://www.castleterracerestaurant.com/index.html), or [The Kitchin](http://www.thekitchin.com/kitchin/alacarte). I would prefer a place where it's quiet, not a lot of children, and has killer desserts. We're splurging! 

For a nicer lunch, I was looking at [The Cellar Door](http://www.thecellardooredinburgh.com/restaurant/menu/index.html) or maybe the lunch menu from one of the restaurants above.

Aside from that, we love casual and/or hole-in-the-walls places, especially those that are away from the typical tourist areas and are frequented by locals. If anyone would like to recommend their favorite spot (especially Indian food, coffee/tea, bakery, etc) that would be VERY much appreciated. We'll try pretty much try anything. The same goes for any attractions or sights that are off the beaten path. 

Thank you!

Still with me? Okay, here we go. 

A little summarizing first: 

As we know, in the Series 6 two-parter _The Rebel Flesh/The Almost People_ a doppleganger of The Doctor is created from The Flesh. Wackiness ensues, including The Doctor and Ganger Doctor pulling the old switcheroo to teach Amy Pond a lesson. 

After much action, as The Doctor departs in the TARDIS with Amy, Rory, and a few of the humans and gangers with him, Ganger Doctor stays behind and uses a sonic screwdriver to melt the marauding ganger back into raw Flesh and, in doing so, melts himself back to raw Flesh as well. 

The gangers that the Doctor takes with him are ""stabilized"" by exposure to the TARDIS' time vortex, so they no longer have to worry about reverting to goo.  

Now for the theorizing: 

What if whatever it is about the TARDIS' energies that stabilizes the Flesh was passed from The Doctor to Ganger Doctor? I mean no one's been exposed to the TARDIS more than The Doctor. And since Ganger Doctor, while he was stabilizing, had ""flashbacks"" to past Doctor, it's clear things about the Doctor besides DNA can be passed along to the Flesh. 

So, suppose Doctor Ganger isn't *permanently* turned back to goo at the end of *The Almost People*. If he could re-stabilize, you've now got a *second, identical* Doctor traipsing about the universe, perhaps unbeknownst to the original Doctor. 

And wouldn't it be clever if the 200+ year older Doctor who bites the dust early in the Series 6 opener, *The Impossible Astronaut*, isn't actually our Doctor . . . *but instead the Ganger Doctor*?!

I am most definitely up for getting this subreddit off the ground. I am looking for like-minded individuals to help in a variety of ways:

* Moderators to help keep things clean and organised

* Someone to do a logo for the subreddit

* People to do a bit of custom CSS for the subreddit to make things look a bit more African Violet

* People to promote this subreddit across campus and different societies

* People to post content i.e. society news etc



If you are interested to help out then please post below with your reasons. If possible also give a bit of information about yourself i.e. course etc

If you have any ideas or thoughts please post them below as well. The more ideas we have the better.


Remember this subreddit is still in its early early stages so it can be anything we want it to be.

I have a quick question for you guys in regards to the actual age of going to a bar. My main concern for this is in the manchester area, because me and my class will be coming to Manchester as a part of a ""study"" trip early next year.

What i'm wondering is if there is any specific age, because after searching around i pretty much hear everything from 18-23. Also how strict are the rules, i mean do the owners actually take their rules seriously.

Also one last thing, please tell me about all the awesome things you can do in Manchester! There must be something :-D

Frankly it's a big plot hole. 

Why couldn't the Doctor use the chameleon Arch to turn Donna into SOMETHING that could handle the Time Lord Conciousness inside her?

I mean, if you can convert a Time Lord into a human, or close enough to one and remove a Time Lord's conciousness, why couldn't he be all like, ""Stand RIGHT there, ZAP, you're good to go, let's check out Barcelona, the planet, not the city."" 

My reasoning is, if it's that simple to convert the file with Format A to Format B, why can't you convert another file with Format B to Format A.

And this isn't an exact analogy, as clearly there is more give and take with the machine than what we see, but clearly it should be possible.

So, who wants to try to fill this plot-hole.

In the midfield, we removed the deadwood of Cole and Poulsen. Yes, Meireles and Aqua are solid players, but I'd rather have a couple fewer options and the ability to get everyone a game than having to worry about too many players in too few spots.  There's something to be said for team chemistry and happiness.

In the back, Insua has been replaced by the absolutely studdly Enrique and Sato, while hard working and a warrior has been replaced by a player who, as a 20 year old international for 7 million, could very well be the signing of the entire window in Coates!

People seem to think he is some sort of straight swap for Lampard, and that is not at all true. He has played some attacking midfield/center forward for Liverpool, but don't forget that he was almost exclusively a CM/CDM in his Porto days.

He only scored 5 goals in 44 matches with Liverpool, and 19 goals in 192 matches with Porto, so do not expect prolific goal-scoring in the mold of Super Frank (or you will most likely be disappointed).

He's got a great engine, and I think he is going to act as more of a Ramires-type player than anything else. The best thing about the signing is that he is very flexible, and he will allow AVB to make all sorts of changes on the fly without wasting substitutions. I'd say he can slot in anywhere from CDM to right-wing, and a player with that sort of flexibility is going to be great to have (esp. if we get the injury bug again).

Also, he is not old and overpriced. He is 28 years old, which means he is probably not even in his prime yet. He's going to be a great transitional player as Chelsea moves from the veterans to the youth revolution in McEachran/Lukaku and company.

Comolli’s team clearly went all out for Liverpool and the results are clear for everyone. 

1.	Buying Adam, Henderson, Downing and Enrique was genius. All 4 of these players have slotted well into the first team and all have impressed in our first 4 games. 

2.	Doni seems like a good backup keeper, since Brad Jones is out of favour. I haven’t seen him play outside of pre-season, so only time will tell. 

3.	Bijev is a highly rated youngster from the US, we loaned him out immediately to Fortuna Dusseldorf. I hope he does well there and comes back with some good experience and a work permit. 

4.	Coates, along with Jose Enrique, has the potential to be the coup of the season. At 20, his potential is immense, and if fulfilled, might see him become a club legend. He needs to be managed well, however, since he is moving from the Uruguayan league to the Premier League. Us fans need to give him time to settle in and adapt to the English game. One bonus of him coming to Liverpool is that it helps Suarez settle down further. 

On the selling front, except for two blips, the results are even better than miraculous. I doubt many of us believed that we would be able to get rid of all the deadwood at the club, but Comolli has achieved the seemingly impossible. We have sold Jovanovic, Ngog, Kyrgiakos, Poulsen and Konchesky, while Joe Cole has gone to Lille on loan. Some players have been released, like El Zhar and Degen, and this shows that the club is simply not going to be patient with players who are clearly not up to mark. 

There are, however, a few blips. 

1.	Aquilani going on loan to Milan. I think nobody was really surprised by Aquilani leaving. His agent had been making noises all summer and he had never come out to publicly refute the rumours. Kenny Dalglish said that Aquilani’s family was in Italy, and that was one of the main reasons he wanted to leave. I just wish he had left on a permanent move instead of another loan. Considering the fact that he performed pretty well for Juventus but was not signed by them despite the massive shopping spree Juve went on in the summer, there might be some hidden problems to him that we do not know of. Whatever it is, I am just glad that I will not see people calling him “Aquaman” anymore. 

2.	Meireles. People having been saying that the transfer request could have been submitted earlier in the season, but I doubt it. Dalglish has always said that he prefers to complete his business earlier. I am sure that they would have preferred to sell Meireles earlier and have time to plan for a replacement. People have pointed to Meireles losing playing time, but people forget that he was not fully fit for the Sunderland match, and he came off the bench against Arsenal. He then went and picked up an injury against Exeter City after only 20 minutes. So out of the 4 games we have played so far, he was played as long as he was fit. Hardly out of favour. 

The problem with Meireles was that this was a total dick move on his part. If his beef was with the pay rise clause in his contract, he should have submitted a transfer request at the beginning of the window, not on the last day. Considering how Bellamy is a back-up striker to replace Ngog, we now have no replacement for the Attack Midfielder position formerly taken up by Meireles and Aquilani. If Liverpool sold Meireles early, we would have had time to look for a right winger or an attacking playmaker. Now, we are one player down with no replacement. 

**Looking forward:**

Our purchases thus far have been very impressive in the games they have played. Take out the deadweight that we have moved, and we have had a very good transfer window. There are, however, still a few positions that can do with strengthening either during January or next summer. 

1.	Left winger. I know Downing has been playing brilliantly for us, but he is the only left winger we have thus far. Any injury to him and we will be back to zero. We need to find a good back-up for him, and I am not sure we have a youngster in the Academy who can take up this role in a year’s time. 

2.	Right winger. We do not have a right winger. Kuyt has been playing in this position, but he is better as a striker, and he is more of a right midfielder than a real winger. In any case, Kuyt is starting to age, and we need to find a replacement for him soon. Henderson has been played on the right side as well, but I find that he would be better in the center. 

3.	Striker. Bellamy is 32 years old and is clearly a stop-gap measure for a back-up. With only 2 other strikers in Suarez and Carroll, any injury to either of them would deplete our frontline quite badly. Having 3 (4 if you include Bellamy) strikers challenging for essentially 2 spots is not too far-fetched, so a young-ish striker would be very much preferred. 

4.	Attacking Midfielder. Gerrard is our only established attacking midfielder now that Meireles and Aquilani have both departed. Henderson does not seem ready to step into this position just yet, and Gerrard’s injury problems are very obvious. Even though Suarez plays in this position when Liverpool plays a 4-3-2-1, we do not want to overwork him since he also needs to play as the solo striker at times. 

**Suggestion:**

 Thomas Mueller, or Eden Hazard.

 I prefer Mueller, because he has the ability to play any of the 4 positions I listed above. In Bayern, he is constantly rotated across the frontline, and this shows his adaptability. He is creative, has the ability to score (World Cup Golden Boot), has loads of stamina, and is incredibly hardworking. Basically, I see him as an upgraded version of Kuyt, only he is even more flexible. He has international and European experience, and will have played 3 seasons in Bayern Munich’s first team by the end of this season. If Liverpool have a good showing this season, and secure Champion’s League placing, there is a chance we can buy him. Throw down 40 million pounds. He is worth it. 

Eden Hazard is very good as well, and there are rumours that by loaning Joe Cole to them (and also reportedly continuing to pay the bulk of Cole’s wages during the loan), Lille will be giving us first refusal option on Hazard. This has been refuted publicly, but such things are never announced in public, so we will know at the end of the season. The problem with Hazard for me is that he is a little slight in size, and he seems a little too showy/selfish at times. No matter, he will still be an incredible addition to Liverpool.
 
If we can only afford one of the two, I would go for Mueller without hesitation. Best case, of course, is to get both, but that is starting to sound a little like FM. 

**TL;DR: Very good transfer window, Meireles is a dick, I want Mueller! **

Thoughts?

Of this ilk, we know that ""Silence will Fall"" was the common thread of Season 5, and furthermore, at time code 29:00, the Sister of the Water explains what happened to her people, and that they ""saw Silence, and the end of all things"" through the cracks on Saturnine (their home-world, presumably).
So, in context of the Silence, we know they have time travel, hence the 1) abandoned and occupied TARDIS replicas in The Lodger, and the Day of the Moon, and 2) their ability to open cracks at any point in history. We also know of their ability to alter time, hence Rory's extraction from reality and the soldiers lost in the forest on the Byzantium. I am also interested in the strange changing use of Silence as 1) a group, and 2) a thing. For instance, we know from LKH that the Silence is a religion devoted to the oldest question (which, for the record, I believe to be ""Doctor Who?""), but through the cracks in the universe, the Sister of the Water ""saw Silence,"" as if it were a thing to be beholden, as opposed to a lack thereof.
I am aware of the ""old news"" factor of this post, but I figured I'd try and evoke some eureka moment in someone's mind by making funny noises with my mouth somewhere along the lines of bingle-bongle dingle dangle. Also excuse the mistitlement of this post, but I forgot to change it...

Addition: in the Lodger, the old man who is the resident upstairs sounds a tad like a nicer version of the man who says ""Silence will fall"" in I think the Big Bang. This may lend credence to the possibility that that man was the creator of the imitation TARDIS (Emergency protocols for the Doctor's appear as the Doctor's current Regeneration).

Lets face it keane being out is a moot point because he has been out for the past 2 years more or less.

 Crouch never had to go because of the player himself, but the tactics. I for one was fed up of the tendancy we had to ""hoof it to him and hope"" when things go tough, because everyone worked out how to stop it.

Essentially we have swapped Adebayor for Crouch at this point in time, I would say most people would agree we are stronger now in that respect.

**Midfield** - Bentley, Jenas, Palacios, are all out and to be fair the only one who will be noticed is palacios seeing as the other 2 are not in first team plans. Hopefully we can get them sold on. Parker and Falque in and Modric didn't end up being Berbatov II.

So its a swap of Palacios for Parker, which I am Sure you will agree is a good thing. Falque could light the pitch up I hope, and keeping Modric could either turn out to be great if he gets his head down and plays, or end up being shite. Hopefully he will get his head down and make sure he doesn't ruin any prospect of being sold on by being miserable.

**Defence** Hutton is out, Friedel is in. Bassong remains here. Our defence has not been THE big long term problem, but it was recently sodomised by manchester and needs time to repair. Injury wise we need to get players back and it will still be strong. In MY humble opinion Gomes is capable of playing as well as or maybe better than Friedel, but as we all know he could leap the length of goal one minute, and spill a cross into the net the next.

**Summary** - So defence and midfield have technically strengthened. Maybe not to the degree we hoped. The squad overall is very slightly better. I think Harry is banking on motivating and pushing people to perform how they did 2 seasons ago.

Would anyone disagree that with Defoe playing like he did 2 years ago, Adebayor getting fired up and on form that we would suffer a goal drought? Pav needs a swift kick up the arse and needs to be rewarded with starts when he does well. He is a more than capable striker and I would love for him to get right on form and make this an awesome season.

Modric backed up by Parker is a mouth watering prospect, a great player who can easily adapt to the situation, backing up by a creative genius (modric), with 1 fast creative winger (I see no issues with Bale) and 1 fast winger (Lennon needs to learn to pick the right pass/cross, and when to shoot). Hell with sandro back we could run a 5 man midfield with modric being the puppet master for attacks and Huddlestone or Sando holding the middle and turning defence into attack. I think we would have the ingredients for incredible counter-attacking ability.

BAE is awesome, as a player and a person. Again like I said above a great player who could easily turn attack to defence, we have Corluka as well who is capable of doing the same. We all know we have a CB problem, but if we get Dawson, Bassong and King fit and working well, its not like we will have a massive hole. 

Younger players liek Livermore for example are easily available as a good backup for the team.

Also important to note is that we have the 2 most difficult ties out of the way already. The team we have should be more than capable of taking on anyone, and should be capable of getting reliable results against anyone but the ""top four."" We dont face City or Utd again until next year now, barring cup ties.

 I was pissed at the end of the window, but thinking about it, we should be able to do well until January, then instead of thinking we need a full overhaul like many of us felt we needed this window, we might be able to take January to fill the gaps as required. If Defoe/Pav/Adebayor are playing well we won't be thinking ""fuck we need a striker."" I doubt midfield will be an issue aside from Modric being linked with someone yet again. Defence might need a boost for cover, or another CB but again it would be a patch-up not a redo.

If you have made it this far congratulations lol. I guess I will end by saying  that I hope this helps people feel better about the close of the window. At least the team isn't trashed like the year we sold berbatov. There is real potential when you think about it this, team can do brilliant if it plays at its best and plays reliably. Lets jsut hope Harry can get it motivated, fired-up and gel everyone together.

I know the easy answer is Everton, and sure, for the majority of fans, it is.

For me however, as much as I despise them, I seem to REALLY HATE Man Utd and (due to numerous factors including recent transfer deadline days) Chelsea.

I also have a real thing against a few frustrating European teams (including Marseilles and Bayern Munich) but these are just gut instincts.

To use the new format, you need to use it like this:

You need to keep the quote marks in.

The other format is still available to use.

Also, I'm wondering what you guys think about hiding the downvote arrow in the comments section. We get a lot of people downvoted in here for saying something controversial/not popular but that still adds to the discussion of something.

**[Reddiquette](http://www.reddit.com/help/reddiquette)** says: Please **don't**:

&gt;Downvote opinions just because you disagree with them. The down arrow is for comments that add nothing to the discussion.

&gt;Downvote opinions just because they are critical of you. The down arrow is for comments that add nothing to the discussion.

If you find a comment offensive you should report it and the mods can deal with it.

But Reddiquette also says Please **do**:

&gt;Vote. The up and down arrows are your tools to make reddit what you want it to be. If you think something is good, upvote it. If you think it shouldn't be on reddit, or if it is off-topic on a particular community, downvote it.

I'm not sure if it was mentioned before, but this has something to do with the silence. 

So I'm watching Vampires of Venice, and about 26 minutes in (right when the black girl is being thrown in the water for helping the doctor and amy) the guy says ""And so in memory to the children lost to the silence..."". I'm starting to think the whole arc is about the silence. I thought the main plot was going to be something about the valeyard, but apparently not. So the silence isn't the aliens that made you forget them, but a movement or possibly an event. 

Right after that they also talk a bit more about it. I'm really starting to think the silence was an event and ""the silence will fall"" means something along the lines of ""the event will descend on the universe, etc"" not along the lines of ""the roman empire will fall"" where they cease to exist.

GK- **worse** Frankly, I think Jussi is on a sharp decline. I'm very anxious to see how Bogdan fares because I'm quickly losing faith in Jussi at goal.

Defenders - **better** Personnel-wise we haven't changed, but I think Gary Cahill is playing better than last year, even though Paul Robinson hasn't impressed me as much this year. I think we'll be better with Boyata or even Wheater at CB instead of Knight. From what I understand, most of the 3m we paid for Tyrone Mears and Chris Eagles went toward getting Mears over here, so he might end up being a better option at RB than Steinsson.

Midfield - **worse... for now** It's really hard to replace Stuart Holden, but once he's back I'll be happy with our midfield again. Except for the game against QPR, Fabrice Muamba has been awful. Mark Davies, however, has been fantastic. Chris Eagles is no Chung Yong Lee by a long stretch. It's wait-and-see with Kakuta (who I'm tempted to start calling [Kakuna](http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Kakuna_(Pok%C3%A9mon))), but I think he should be a step up from Eagles. I should also add that Martin Petrov has been playing slightly better than last season thus far. I've even seen him track back to defense once in a while!

Forwards - **About the same** No, we don't have another Daniel Sturridge, but Klasnic (unlike last season) went though summer training with the club this year and looks like he can play a full 90 minutes at a high level. SKD looks like he's still playing competitively as ever. I honestly believe that Owen Coyle will get the most out of David N'Gog. It might even be a scenario like Sturridge where we have a fanstastic young striker who was stuck behind a group of established world-class strikers and struggling to find first team football. And the best part is that we have him for the next 3 years! Between SKD, N'Gog, Tuncay, and Klasnic, I think we can get similar goal production as last year. 

In summary, I think that we have recovered nicely from all of our player exits this summer. I think we  have a good  chance of playing for a top-half finish this year and with a good amount of luck we might be in contention for a Europa League spot. Maybe I'm just being too optimistic. . .

So I would sometimes be confused when the Doctor does things like leaving himself notes or whatever.

BUT THAT'S NOT THE POINT OF THIS.

What I'm actually thinking about is, since it has been shown that Melody has grown up with Amy and Rory their entire lives, and when she regenerates into River she is already an adult, doesn't that mean that Rory and Amy NEVER get their baby back? Are they still trying to find her? It would seem like, to me, that barring another sort of ""universe reboot"" that any attempt to find melody will be pointless as she has to somehow wind up growing up with them.

I was rewatching last night - you always catch stuff you missed the first go-round on the second watching, and this stood out to me. After River gives the Doctor the Judas Tree death kiss, one of the crew of the Tesselecta makes a comment that the Doctor can't die in 1938 Berlin, he dies at Lake Silencio on 4/22/2011 - and *it's a fixed point*. Like Pompeii. Meaning that the event can't be changed, meaning that the Doctor *will* die at Lake Silencio.

In other words, they wouldn't be able to rejigger time to make it not happen. And yes, I do realise the 'fixed point in time' thing was used by Davies and Moffat is in charge now, but during the episodes last season with the Silurians, the 11th Doctor mentions fixed points in time again (ie, how that moment with the negotiations between Silurian and human wasn't one), which means that they're probably not disregarding this particular rule. 

What I'm taking from that is that the Doctor (nor River, Amy, or Rory) can prevent his death at Lake Silencio, no matter what they do... 

However, that doesn't necessarily mean it's ""our"" Doctor. Remember, we've had a metacrisis Doctor *and* the flesh gangerDoctor in the past few seasons, and rewatching LKH has put me firmly in the boat that the 1100+ year old Doctor that dies at Lake Silencio is *not* the same one that gets the invitation and shows up at the diner.",false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,null,null,self,It's a fixed point (Let's Kill Hitler spoilers),2,http://www.reddit.com/r/doctorwho/comments/k1re1/its_a_fixed_point_lets_kill_hitler_spoilers/

Mels said ""penny in the air"" twice in LKH - when Amy and Rory were awkwardly figuring out their relationship, and again when she was regenerating. What if ""penny in the air"" also describes (at least partially) this whole story arc? Time is really being twisted around, even more than usual. We now know that River is really circular in that she helped get her parents together, is named after herself, and becomes the woman she does because she is told that the Doctor loves her and trusts her in the future. A lot of events can be traced back to a singular moment - such as River's inception, which sounds like a recipe for unstable branched universes. 

What if time can be rewritten after all, and the hypothetical penny is still in the air and won't drop til the climax? Could this be why Melody/River has tried to kill the Doctor twice - once succeeding, once failing? Are these two of the options? Could they exist simultaneously until one is chosen and the other fades away? It's very quantum. This would also explain the sudden presence of Mels. Up until now we had only seen the option where she is not Amy and Rory's best mate. Also, I'm not sure why River would try to kill the Doctor again if she already did it once. She said she didn't remember, but the Tesselectors knew about it. Maybe it's a fixed point only on their side of the penny. River is a killing machine and all, but it seems rather unnecessary to kill him twice. When the penny drops I don't think we'll get either of these options though. Instead we'll get a mostly unseen one. What if Melody is rescued as a baby and is raised properly by Amy and Rory? She could still grow up and be with the Doctor - she just would have taken a different road..

Maybe this is a little too similar to the series 4 finale, but I suppose the difference is the different options all exists simultaneously and we can't be sure what side anything is on.

It's finally here, it's been in the works for a little bit, but everything should be all set. We have on offer 5 different Chelsea crests to be displayed beside your name. [You can see them all here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chelsea_F.C.#Crest). You can also specify your favorite player! It'll appear when a person hovers over your crest.

The process is fully automated. We've enlisted the help of a bot, BigFriendlyRobot, made by redditor extremepopcorn, to handle flair requests. To get yours, click on the link for the Chelsea crest that you want. Before you hit send, you can add the name of your favorite player **to the second line of the message**. Formatting is very important - make sure you put two spaces after the end of the first line to force a line break.

**IF YOU DON'T WANT TO NAME A FAVOURITE PLAYER**: Press enter after the message and please put a space. The bot is expecting a second line, if you don't do this, you won't get your crest!

Links to get your crest:

[Original Chelsea crest, 1905-52](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=bigfriendlyrobot&amp;subject=chelseafc&amp;message=1905  )  
[Second Chelsea crest, 1952-53](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=bigfriendlyrobot&amp;subject=chelseafc&amp;message=1952  )

[Current Chelsea crest, 2005-](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=bigfriendlyrobot&amp;subject=chelseafc&amp;message=present  )  

To clarify, messages should look like this:

    Favourite player OR [SPACE]

It'll probably take a few (10 - 15 mins) for the crest to show up. If there's any problems, please message the moderators and we'll do our best to solve it ASAP. Thanks and enjoy!


edit: **IF YOU ARE HAVING TROUBLE GETTING IT TO WORK, DON'T FRET.**

Message me [ScreamingGerman] or the mods [see sidebar] with the player name and crest you want and we'll add it manually.

Sign up for everything you think you'd like, most clubs have introduction socials or events where you can meet everyone and get a feel for the club. 

2) Get a freshers wristband, it might be a bit of a queue at ents (the on campus ticket shop) but saves you a lot of money if you go to most of the events. 

3) Go to as many freshers events as you can, freshers week is there for a reason, you have no lectures and so no excuses for not going out. You'll meet loads of new people, get to know the clubs and bars and there are some great discounts. Make the most of it before lectures start. 

4) Go into town, sounds simple and obvious but get to know Swansea a bit better, you'll see how great a city it is and feel more at home once you know your way around. 

5) Go to your introductory lecture, Ok so not as fun as other things on the list but definately recommended. You'll get to know the department and your lecturers better plus you'll be able to sort out your lectures and timetables, something worth doing early rather than finding out halfway through the year you're attending the wrong lectures (trust me I know people who've done that)

6) Get an AU card and your student card, once you get an AU card you'll have insurance and be able to do any sport you like while at Swansea uni. Your student card will enable you to use the library, get discounts in certain shops and gain you entry to certain clubs. 

7) Go to the beach, definately one of Swansea's selling points, the beach is so close and pretty damn amazing and fortunately September weather usually holds out for us so go while it's still sunny, it's not quite the same once the rain kicks in. 

8) Try something new, university gives us the great opportunity to try the things we might not have got the option to when we were younger. Every sports team caters for beginners so it's never to late to start, be it picking up cheerleading or jiujitsu you'll be surprised how quickly you learn. 

9) Don't lock yourself in your room, it's natural to miss home the first few days/weeks of moving to university but sitting in your room will only make it worse. Remember each one of you is in a similar situation and only by getting out there and living it will you realise just how great it really is. Trust me you don't want to go home at Christmas and hear all your friends say how great a time they're having at their unis just to tell them you've barely left your room. 

10) Enjoy yourself, cheesy I know but university really is the best time of your life and freshers is one of the best things about it. 3 years into my degree and I still remember freshers fondly (well at least the bits I can remember).

The universe has two timelines. The first being the normal one, and the second being a kind of universal timeline. It operates differently than ours: It is (from our perspective) all *kinds* of wibbly-wobbly. Things happening in almost entirely random orders, etc. More importantly, though, it's 5th-dimensional. In the same way two things can be happening in 3D space at the same time, two things can be happening in 4D spacetime at the same supertime. While this doesn't make a huge difference in how things work, it explains smaller things like ""Why is the TARDIS receiving this phone call now, and not any other arbitrary time?""

Possible series spoiler ahead. [spoiler](/s ""The most important episodes of this season are The Curse of the Black Spot that talks about the uniqueness of the power of love. Love is something that amazes the Doctor. Remember his shock when Rory was found to be alive as the Last Centurion? Rory is in a way the archtype that the Doctor admires. Rory a man born in regular time waits centuries to be reunited with his great love of Amy. He even risks his life for her as the robotic centurion. Also Amy's love is great that it bring Rory's soul back from the breach and puts it somehow in to the robot version.

The other important episodes are The Rebel Flesh and The Almost People. The storm changed something in the ganger episode for the unique case of the humans and the doctor's gangers becoming new life. The storm evolved the non sentient flesh in to something unique and new. BTW, if you believe abiogenesis evolutionary theory which Moffat does, then this is what happens to create all life.

The real subpoint though for Moffat is found in the Doctor's Wife episode. The Tardis reveals that it carries him to places he doesn't plan because it knows his future. When it chose him, it saw all of his time. The past, present, and future all the same to the Tardis. The doctor after leaving so long knows major points. He's smart and wise, yet he even cheats as it were as he goes to the Library, where he will meets for the first time and saves for the last time our version of River Song, and other libraries to get spoilers. The doctor isn't omniscient. He cheats by learning about the fixed points and some of his own interactions in the time stream.  

All along though he proves continually he is not in charge. The Tardis is in that it has shaped his journey to get him to where he eventually will become something akin to the Time Lord Victorious and where he will learn to really live and not just be alive by risking to love River Song. He will by then have conquered his fears including loneliness and death. He will in effect have mastered time, which all of us can when risk to love and loose. Time and love are the only thing in the Who universe that are basically treated as godlike. They always are.

The recurring theme from the 1st doctor on is a fear of death. The 1st doctor is afraid something will happen to Susan. Later Doctors care about their companions in almost child like ways. Remember even perfect 10 said I don't want to die. Loneliness and death are the constant themes of the doctor. Moffat is going for something bigger than just a neat love story by introducing River. He is setting up someone that loves him but also can really relate to him. We never know how old River actually is in any given moment, other than The Impossible Astronaut and Let's Kill Hitler.

Doctor Who is a moral tale about the purpose of life as seen through a time lord named the Doctor. All the early doctors give a version of the Doctor that are loners but none are really loners. The lone exception seems to be the 8th but we don't know much about him. All the doctor's are constantly picking up companions that leave or die who are social misfits like himself. Inevitably, he is always left alone in a ship meant to be inhabited by at a crew of six people. 

The eventual moral tale that Moffat is probably going to drive home is that the journey though important isn't as important as who it is with.  The 12th Doctor seems to get this, the last Doctor, who won't regenerate but will actually die in some sense is a Doctor at peace with himself and time. He has met River Song, we haven't experienced this but she has. He loves her knowing that he and she will die. He has experienced her whole time line. She has experienced part of his and is told by him of the rest. He is confident, without being cocky according to RS. He fondly remembers his past relationships, even telling River of them, as she journals his life. In effect 12 is the best of all Doctor.

Possible series spoiler ahead. [One of the two most important episodes of this season is The Curse of the Black Spot that talks about the uniqueness of the power of love. Love is something that amazes the Doctor. Remember his shock when Rory was found to be alive as the Last Centurion? Rory is in a way the arch type of a hero that the Doctor admires. Rory a man born in regular time waits centuries to be reunited with his great love of Amy. He even risks his life for her as the robotic centurion. Also Amy's love is great that it bring Rory's soul back from the breach and puts it somehow in to the robot version.
The other important episodes are The Rebel Flesh and The Almost People. The storm changed something in the ganger episode for the unique case of the humans and the doctor's gangers becoming new life. The storm evolved the non sentient flesh in to something unique and new. BTW, if you believe abiogenesis evolutionary theory which Moffat does, then this is what happens to create all life.
The real sub plot though for Moffat is found in the Doctor's Wife episode which many feel is a throw away episode. In effect it actually gives the reason the Doctor has been on his journey. He isn't in control. The Tardis reveals that it carries him to places he doesn't plan because it knows his future. It takes him where he needs to be. When it chose him, it saw all of his time. The past, present, and future all the same to the Tardis. The Doctor after living so long knows major points of history but he still isn't a complete person. He's smart and wise, yet he even cheats as he goes to the Library, where he will meet for the first time and saves for the last time our final version of River Song. He goes to the library to get spoilers. The doctor isn't omniscient. He cheats time by learning about the fixed points and some of his own interactions in the time stream. He is invested in Earth because of his love for humanity which in some way reelects part of who he is.
All along though he proves continually he is not in charge. The Tardis is in charge of the Doctor's journey. It has shaped his journey to get him to where he eventually will become something akin to the Time Lord Victorious and where he will learn to really live and not just be alive by risking to love River Song. He will by then have conquered his fears including loneliness and death. He will in effect have mastered time, which all of us can when risk to love and loose. Time and love are the only thing in the Who universe that are basically treated as godlike. They always are.
The recurring theme from the 1st doctor on is a fear of death. The 1st doctor is afraid something will happen to Susan. Later Doctors care about their companions in almost child like ways. The Doctor though never risks to really love unless he becomes human, when he becomes just Smith or the copy of 10 that is made for Rose. Remember even perfect 10 said I don't want to die. Loneliness and death are the constant themes of the Doctor. That is what his subconscious created in the nightmare world of the Doctor. Moffat is going for something bigger than just a neat love story by introducing River. He is setting up someone that loves him but also can really relate to him. We never know how old River actually is in any given moment, other than The Impossible Astronaut and Let's Kill Hitler.
Doctor Who is a moral tale about the purpose of life as seen through a time lord named the Doctor. All the early doctors give a version of the Doctor that are loners but none are really loners. The lone exception seems to be the 8th but we don't know much about him. All the doctor's are constantly picking up companions that leave or die who are social misfits like himself. Inevitably, he is always left alone in a ship meant to be inhabited by at a crew of six people.
The eventual moral tale that Moffat is probably going to drive home is that the journey though important isn't as important as who it is with. The 12th Doctor seems to get this, the last Doctor, who won't regenerate but will actually die in some sense is a Doctor at peace with himself and time. He has met River Song, we haven't experienced this but she has. He loves her knowing that he and she will die. He has experienced her whole time line. He plays with her. She has experienced part of his and is told by him of the rest. He is confident, without being cocky according to RS. He fondly remembers his past relationships, even telling River of them, as she journals his life. In effect 12 is the best of all Doctor. He will be a compound of the best of all prior 11, which were differing parts of the Doctor's psyche working out what it means to be a being living in time.]

If there is confirmation (A companion seeing them from one scene to the next) then its the same one. any odd things in the scene should be noted aswell (the ""Magic sphere"" that saved the doctor in the beginning of TIA for instance).

Any moment the Doctor is out of view for more then a few seconds can be considered a changeover, especially if no one else sees him.  I'm working of the original theory that their are 2 Doctors running around, but honestly, their could be as many as 4 or more.

The current season is set to the continuing story arc of revealing River Song but to a more important back drop for the concept of the meaning of her life beginning of the AGMGW and eventual death in SIL as it effects the final regeneration of the Doctor. 

One of the two most important episodes of this season is The Curse of the Black Spot that talks about the uniqueness of the power of love. Love is something that amazes the Doctor. Remember his shock when Rory was found to be alive as the Last Centurion? Rory is in a way the arch type of a hero that the Doctor admires. Rory a man born in regular time waits centuries to be reunited with his great love of Amy. He even risks his life for her as the robotic centurion saving the cube from fire. Also Amy's love is so great for Rory that it bring Rory's soul back from the breach and puts it somehow in to the robot version.
The other important episodes are The Rebel Flesh and The Almost People because they hypothesize that the storm changed something in the ganger material that made for the unique case of the humans and the doctor's gangers becoming new actual people. The storm evolved the non sentient flesh in to something unique and new. BTW, if you believe abiogenesis evolutionary theory which Moffat does, then this is what happens to create all life.

The real sub plot though for Moffat is found in the Doctor's Wife episode which many feel is a throw away episode. In effect it actually gives the reason the Doctor has been on his journey.

The past, present, and future all the same to the Tardis. The Doctor after living so long knows major points of history but he still isn't a complete person. He's smart and wise, yet he lies and cheats as he goes to future libraries to learn spoilers about himself. It isn't a accident that he meets River in the Library, where he will meet her for the first time and saves her for the last time as our final version of River Song. He goes to the library to get spoilers. The doctor isn't omniscient. He cheats time by learning about the fixed points and some of his own interactions in the time stream. He is invested in Earth because of his love for humanity which in some way reflects part of who he is and what he loves.

All along though he proves continually he is not in charge. The Tardis is in charge of the Doctor's journey. It has shaped his journey to get him to where he eventually will become something akin to the Time Lord Victorious and where he will learn to really live and not just be alive by risking to love River Song.

But, if you could find a few seconds to visit http://gentleotterblog.blogspot.com/ and offer a few words of support she might not feel so alone and so badly treated.

I watched the fifth season (eleventh doctor) and thought it was -brilliant-. I absolutely love Amy Pond and River Song and the Eleventh Doctor is just great. 

Then I went back to the first season, and hated it. It got much better during the second season with the tenth doctor. I started the third and was so excited to finally get to Donna! Then I get one episode of Donna and end up with.. Martha. I have to say, I skipped the whole third season and went to the fourth because I really, really, really like Donna. 

**(spoilers ahead)**

I just finished Journey's End and I have to say, I was absolutely heartbroken about what happens. She finally became the person she wanted to be. She was smart and witty and she believed in herself. She was given that for all of ten minutes and then had every memory of everything important she had ever done wiped away from her mind. 

I have to say, I did like the way the season was wrapped up for everyone else. But.. what will ever happen to Donna? Will she just go on forever and never be of use? Time Lords are so rare, but in the fourth season we saw a propogation of them. Jenny, the Doctor's Daughter, The human/time Lord Tenth Doctor, and Donna Noble, the human with the Time Lord mind. 

I really like the Eleventh Doctor, and his adventures have been exciting, but do you ever think that in future Doctor Who shows we might ever see what happens to these people? And especially Donna?

GK - Jennings. 590 Games for us, great at claiming crosses and scored for us too (admittedly joined the Arse, so I did consider Clemence but Jennings was one of a kind).

DL - Hughton. Mr Consistent, more than 300 Spurs appearances. 

CB - Ledley. Nuff said.

CB - Mabbutt. Uncompromising, dedicated and loyal. Plus he had diabetes - read his autobiography, it's fantastic.

RB - Perryman. Spurs through and through, with us for 17 years and has the club record for appearances - 854 for the first team. Incredibly versatile, he was also amazing in midfield.

ML - Cliff Jones. If you don't know him, have a long hard look at your Spurs credentials.

CM - Hoddle. Duh.

CM - Gazza/Mackay. I didn't know how to split these two - add another flair player in Gazza or bring in the enforcer in Mackay? Either way, two amazing servants of the club.

MR - Waddle. One of the best dribblers of a ball, and also scored goals.

S - Jimmy Greaves. My dad's favourite player (he has seen all of this team play at one time or another I think) and for good reason. Sublime footballer, effortless skill and an unbelievable scoring record.

S - Lineker. I thought about Teddy, but Lineker would be the perfect foil for Greavsie. The ultimate poacher, another one with a cracking record for us.

Manager - Bill Nick, assisted by Burkinshaw.

Why would it be bad if the Doctor was American as long as the writers were still British? If the writers write it ""British"" then really the only thing different would be the accent. I'm missing something aren't I?

Okay, obviously, Mrs. Robinson is Anne Bancroft's character in The Graduate.

In Let's Kill Hitler, newly regenerated Melody/River puts her leg up and does the Anne Bancroft pose from The Graduate and says ""Hello, Benjamin.""

Wouldn't The Doctor who was in The Impossible Astronaut and called River Mrs. Robinson already have seen The Graduate and would know a reference to that movie when he saw it?

I think the first thing I'd do is bring back the Zygons. They've been away for far too long. i'd love to see a lot more of the classical monsters back, remodled but faithful to the original (unlike the Silurians). I'd also challenge some of the controversial issues such as the regeneration limit, the Doctor NOT being Doctor Who, and most importantly, **definitely** not half human on his mother's side. 

Would you keep the Time Lords dead? I presonally find them too pompous and drag the Doctor down. he's much better as a lone mad man with a box. 

Also, I'd bring [this guy](http://images.google.com/imgres?q=benedict+cumberbatch&amp;hl=en&amp;gbv=2&amp;tbm=isch&amp;tbnid=IPm8BLZYbE5H6M:&amp;imgrefurl=http://www.listal.com/viewimage/2409681&amp;docid=GlJ4N2gk0snZiM&amp;w=600&amp;h=393&amp;ei=cStiTsqMN43C8QPX9d2jCg&amp;zoom=1&amp;iact=hc&amp;vpx=598&amp;vpy=88&amp;dur=2028&amp;hovh=182&amp;hovw=278&amp;tx=144&amp;ty=96&amp;page=11&amp;tbnh=160&amp;tbnw=251&amp;start=128&amp;ndsp=10&amp;ved=1t:429,r:2,s:128&amp;biw=1366&amp;bih=508) ;) as the Master.

""This is a ROUGH Freshers Schedule there are still many tweaks being made and more events being added to the ones we already have (some days have more than one/two events happening so keep an eye out for when I update this soon) But for now:

Freshers Events:

Friday 23rd September: 

Daytime: Wii games in the Stretch, just for people to find their feet and relax.

Night: School Disco (with a twist): This event is specifically aimed at welcoming the PGCE students, however everyone is welcome. Think Nicholas Nickleby, Professor McGonagall, Miss Honey and Miss Trunbull, Mildred Hubble, Simon Casey or just a teacher/school kid. 

Saturday 24th September:

Daytime: Second Hand Sale, mostly course books and kitchen utensils (pots, pans, cutlery, etc.)

Night Time: Now most of you should be in halls or moved in, start meeting everyone through fun and games, with the sabbatical officers. This event is aimed at getting people talking and meeting as many people as possible.

Sunday 25th September:

Daytime: FIFA and Pool Tournament 

Night time: Traffic Light Party (dress code: Red (taken), yellow (maybe) green (available)).

Monday 26th September

Daytime: Picnic and Tea Party: This is an alcohol free event, an event for people to enjoy an indoors picnic in the garden room in the stretch. This is an ideal event for students with children or students who don’t want to go over the top with all the club nights or partying.

Night Time: A Club night (TBC and details finalised).

Tuesday 27th September:

Daytime: Cheese &amp; Wine Evening: A good way to meet other mature and postgraduate students. However it is open to everyone who enjoys cheese and wine (non alcoholic drinks also available) (£2 entry, must book before hand).

Night Time: Musical Bingo, Quiz and Karaoke (Quiz and Karaoke what it says on the tin, Musical Bingo is when a song is played and you have to tick it off on your bingo sheet, it also gives people an excuse to sing along to random songs ranging from Britney Spears to Lady Gaga to the Happy Days theme tune). A night that has been bought back this year. It used to rival club sandwich for best night of the week when it used to run in previous years. 

Wednesday 28th September:

Night Time: Club Sandwich, the biggest night of the week every week, a club night with cheesy music to sing and dance to. Goldsmiths Students’ favourite weekly night. 

Thursday 29th September: 

Daytime: Freshers Fayre

Night Time: LGBTQ Club Night

Friday 30th September:

Daytime: Freshers Fayre and Poster Sale

Night Time: Funny Folk Comedy Night (Stand Up Comedy at the SU).

Saturday 1st October:

Daytime: BBQ, Pimms and Sports Day on the back field (Egg and Spoon Races, Wheelbarrow Races, etc.

Night Time: Freshers Frolic (A ball type event, but details still to be confirmed).

Sunday:

Daytime: Deptford and Greenwich Market Tour. 

The Daytime events starting time ranges between 12pm-6pm (times for events will be confirmed soon).

All night time events start at 9pm and the finising time ranges between midnight-3am (again times will be confirmed soon).

Prices of the events will be confirmed soon""

So I'm left wondering...  Am I really the only one who **likes** the way Moffat's doing it?  Am I the only one who's enjoying the gradual return to longer arcs and more complex stories?  Don't get me wrong, I greatly enjoyed both Eccleston and Tennant's runs, but I like my Doctor epic and telling long, complicated stories that take multiple episodes to conclude, and frankly, if every single episode of the next series all revolved around one central plot being worked out in two or three 'acts'(maybe with one 'breather' episode or two like ""The Doctor's Wife"" or ""The Black Spot), I'd love every second of it.  

So, am I the only one?  Or is everyone just doubly frustrated because A. Not everything is self-contained in one episode with the rare two-parter and B.

This is completely on topic, so downvotes are discouraged despite what I am about to say:

**I HATE Mark Gatiss episodes.**

His Dr Who scripts are just pathetically weak as can be and I'm really starting to hate him for it.

I'll admit it, I enjoyed Sherlock and some of his other works, but every time I see the name Mark Gatiss at the beginning of a Dr Who episode, I cringe.  He just seems to have his head way up where the sun don't shine when he's writing Dr Who and it really pisses me off.

Damn it Mark, please please PLEASE stop writing Dr Who episodes.  Stick to what you are good at and I'll watch your stuff.  Keep writing this shit and I'm giving up on you.

Please, could someone tell me what he actually adds to the show?  I can't find a single redeeming quality of any of his episodes.

**Edit 1:**  See I knew this was going to be controversial.  Here is a wild idea folks, instead of just downvoting and walking away, how about you actually follow normal reddiquette (this is all on topic and very relavent) and then you can convince me that he's really a good Doctor Who writer?

I just don't see it.  He is like the Ron Paul of Dr Who.  Say anything bad about him, no matter what facts you use to back it up, you get downvoted to hell by the hivemind.

So instead I challenge you to prove to me that this guy's episodes are good...even decent.  I just don't see it, and I seriously want to know why so many look upon him as a living god.

**Edit 2:**  Tragedy Trousers made a good point, so now I shall clarify my views.

Overall, I just feel Mark Gatiss's works are just lacking in quality.  He pretty much can't come up with an original idea, and all his episodes have the same feel.  But we can take a closer look at his 4 episodes:

""Unquiet Dead"" - Aliens live in the gas pipes of a morgue.  A 900+ year old scientist time lord can't find a solution to stop the aliens, *only a famous writer from 1869 can*.  Hell the doctor pretty much gives up in this episode and waits to die.  And what was Dickens doing in this episode anyways?  He was an empty suit with no character development.  

""Idiots Lantern"" - Ugh, do I need to go over this one?  An alien hides as a TV broadcast and sucks peoples faces&lt;?&gt; off so it can make a new body.  The Doctor 'records' her onto a betamax&lt;!&gt; tape.  Peoples faces miracuously reappear and theose people are still alive despite having no mouths or noses to breathe through.

""Victory of the Daleks"" - Three Daleks SOMEHOW survived the Bad Wolf hand of god AND a Reality Bomb  AND being sucked into the Void.  They pretend to be WW2 secret weapons, and say some of the stupidest lines ever given to a Dalek (WOULD YOU LIKE SOME TEAAAAA?""), all the while waiting for the doctor so they can reactive a progenitor device.  New Daleks are formed which look like the Mighty Morphin Power Rangers.

""Night Terrors"" - [Spoiler](/s ""People are sucked into a dolls house (say that outloud a few times) where the dolls are alive and try to turn you into dolls.  You wait 45 minutes until something actually happens in the story.  They are miraculously saved by the alien who put them there."")


Cliches to look for in Mark's work:  
Agressive male characters that don't really do anything to the story (Sneed &lt;UD&gt;, Eddie Forman &lt;IL&gt;, Landlord &lt;NT&gt;)

Other characters that don't really do anything to the story but seem like they should (Female officer/soldier &lt;VotD&gt;, Old Lady neighbor &lt;NT&gt;, Mom &lt;NT&gt;, Dickens &lt;UD&gt;)

Scary things that really aren't that scary (Incorporeal ghost-like things &lt;UD, IL&gt;, Slow moving monsters &lt;UD, NT&gt;)

Deux ex Machina...the WORST literary solution of all time  (Gas miraculously sucking out aliens &lt;UD&gt;, Somehow a characters 'humanity' defuses a lethal situation &lt;VotD, NT&gt;, Planes with internal combustion engines and poorly-sealed cockpits are modified in minutes to fly in space &lt;VotD&gt;)",false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,null,null,self,/r/doctorwho...we need to talk.

Rewatching *Let's Kill Hitler* for the second time, though, it struck me that as he was talking to young River he started dropping other rules for her - specifically ""Never be knowingly serious - rule twenty-seven"" and ""Time is not the boss of you - rule four hundred and eight."" The first time through i'd seen this but just thought it was him being silly, but this time i noticed that he ended the episode by quite solemnly giving her rule one.

This is a list of things that I would recommend bringing with you to uni:

Bedroom stuff:

* Bed sheets - 2 sets for when you wash one. Singles (sorry guys don't think there are any double beds around)
 
* Coat hangers - there might be some in your wardrobe when you get there but then again there might not be. It's worth picking up some just in case. 

* Extension lead - probably a 4 socket one. There aren't all that many sockets in your room so getting an extention lead or two will help make a difference. 

* Laptop/computer - this will really help you when you try to get work done rather than waiting for a free computer in the library. 

* Lamp - pick up a cheap one from Wilko's or something. It's handy to have a bedside lamp. 

* Pillow and duvet - would you want to sleep in ones that lots of students already have? No, so bring your own as uni doesn't provide. 

* Comfort items - be it your favourite teddy or some posters. Remember uni policy is that putting up posters is not advisable. Lot's of students ignore this, it's you're home for a year after all. But it is highly recommended to bring white-tac not blu-tac as blu-tac will stain the walls. 

* Clothes basket - you'll need something to keep all your dirty laundry in and to carry it to the laundrette. 

* Iron (but not ironing board)

* Take a look around your bedroom at home right now, anything you need/can't live without/wouldn't want to live without, pack that. 

Bathroom:

* Toothbrush

* Toothpaste

* Towel

* Shampoo/conditioner/shower gel

* Razor

* Flip-flops-better to be safe than sorry when it comes to showering. 

Kitchen:

* 2 plates

* 2 glasses

* Bottle opener

* knife/fork/spoon

* Mug

* Frying pan

* 2 saucepans

* 2 sharp knives

* chopping board

* Utensils (usually sold in packs in Wilkos)

* Strainer 

Don't bring things like toasters and kettles unless you really want to as you can all chip together as a flat and get them, makes it a lot cheaper and avoids having 7 to a flat.

At a minimum, she knew that she would meet the Doctor again in The Pandorica Opens, going so far as to mention it in Flesh and Stone.

Now obviously, River in season 6 being younger wouldn't remember any of this anyways. But while Amy and Rory both remember their alternate timeline before the events of The Big Bang, none of it ever actually *happened* for them (Rory is still human now, for instance).

When we meet River in the ""new"" universe we learn that she's responsible for killing the future Doctor, which we are led to believe is why she was in Stormcage. Given that she hints at this during Season 5 (""You really don't want to know who I killed""), it's presumable that these timelines somehow connect to each other, and that the River we see there is the same as the River we are seeing now, just an older version of herself.

So what happens to River, moving forward through her timeline, right before she reaches the events of The Pandorica Opens? Does she somehow move into another reality? Does she not, and none of that ever happened now?

Don't let me stop you discussing the older ones in the comments though, I'd love to hear your favourites!

---

So I love soundtracks and revere Murray Gold as a hero. I get all the soundtracks when they come out. Here are some of my favourite tracks and why I love them:



**Series 1 &amp; 2 - [Westminster Bridge](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2_1_PD9sjw):** This track brings me back to the pure sense of fun from series 1 and 2 with the Doctor and Rose galivanting around time and space having adventures.

**Series 1 &amp; 2 - [The Doctor's Theme](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBqrv8Ugyxs):** I love the subtlety of this track, bringing out the mystery of the Bad Wolf arc in the first series and continuing through the tenth Doctor's run. It's both eerie, a bit sad and very suggestive.

**Series 1 &amp; 2 - [The Cybermen](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHaYOJj5Maw):** More than any other of the monster theme tunes I like the one created for the Cybermen. I just love the apocalyptic sense of finality and inevitablity conveyed by the main hook.

**Series 1 &amp; 2 - [The Impossible Planet](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYvxt1Bnov4):** This one is just beautiful. Reminds me of how stunning space is.

**Series 3 - [All The Strange, Strange Creatures](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67goV9LyI5o):** Doesn't this one just make you want to run? Of course it does, there are monsters chasing you!

**Series 3 - [My Angel Put the Devil in Me](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8BzbNOOihk):** An example of just how varied Murray Gold's compositions can be. This really brings to life the 1930s New York setting (and is later used in a Star Wars Cantina-like bar).

**Series 3 - [The Doctor Forever](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=844_IkhcP-g):** I think I actually like Martha's Theme more than I like Martha. Anyway, this rendition of it is brilliant.

**Series 4 - [Turn Left](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jwi9C2Xz2ms):** I confess I haven't listened to much of the Series 4 soundtrack but this one easily stands out as my favourite already (as well as being my favourite episode of the series after Silence in the Library). Plus it has the awesome creepy version of the Doctor's Theme at the end.

**Series 5 - [I Am The Doctor](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=emy8E3ZtvVM):** The Series 5 soundtrack is my favourite so far (and I could list most of the tracks and why I love them, but I won't), as is Matt Smith my favourite Doctor. His theme tune reminds of everything I love about this series of Doctor Who.

**Series 5 - [Little Amy](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=580AQ1o_f2U):** This track makes for a wonderful introduction to the series and to Amy's character. This has to be the best introduction for a companion character ever, and the soundtrack brings it out best!

**Series 5 - [The Life And Death Of Amy Pond](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=No2qsjun4Kg):** This track is best in the context of the episode, The Pandorica Opens, but even alone it's brilliant. It plays out the episode as the universe ceases to exist and Amy dies in Rory's arms and is a much more subtle way of conveying the apocalyptic nature of the ending than a more direct ""DUN DUN DUUUUN"" aproach would have been.

**Series 5 - [A River Of Tears](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5nuwvcz50U):** I like the clever use of sequencing in this track, and how it plays up the mystery of who River is and what's in store for the Doctor and her.

This that the other later, Amy Pond recreates the Doctor(and Tardis) at her wedding by remembering him.  All is safe in the universe.

Except there are now two Doctors, one in the Void(kept alive by the Pandorieca that refuses to let those inside it die) and the other in the Universe 2.0.  So this means the Doctor for all of season 6 is a duplicate(perfect duplicate, but a duplicate nonetheless).  Am I grasping at straws and overthinking this or does it seem like a logical thing?

There's a few other issues, but they seem to be addressing all of them(including that the universe they're in is completely recreated).  This particular one has been bugging the crap out of me.

I work for a games distribution company called GMG. We're looking for an intern to join our London office for the next little while. A month or more would be grand.

This position will include making and editing our product pages, approving and monitoring customer reviews, helping out on our forums, helping the operations team with marketing tasks like creating contact sheets, researching and contacting other gaming sites, helping out with social media, writing blog posts and so much more.

We don't have a really long list of definite requirements: You need to be able to speak and write English really well, and you need to be able to use a computer, Office, FTP and all the usual stuff. A knowledge of gaming is very important as well, obviously.

During your stay, while we can't pay you, we CAN shower you in free games, give you some experience of working for a start-up and working in the games industry, get you some contacts and something to put on your CV. We're fairly flexible with times, but we'd like someone to be able to do 5 days a week for a least a month, preferably a little bit more.

We'll pay £500 a month or so towards your TRAVEL expenses so it won't cost you anything to turn up.

So where do the other Mel's come from?  Are they made by remixing Amy and Rory's DNA?  For example, do either of them have African ancestors?  (Please don't bother trolling the cry of ""racist,"" it's a valid question from a genetic POV.)

Skipping over stuff we already know.

""I've been running, faster than I've ever run, and I've been running my whole life."" I don't believe the Doctor believes he's been running his whole life, but the *flesh* doctor has.

At the lake, the Silence is there, and the Doctor seems to understand this fact. Was the whole thing with his death really more of a show for the Silence?

""It's ok, I know it's you."" Said to the astronaut, implying that while the doctor knows who the astronaut is, the astronaut doesn't know that the doctor knows who he/she is. This means the astronaut was not 'invited', but instead came there of their own volition.

Two shots from a 'Gun' we can't see. Just looks like a hand being held up. No blood on the doctor, so nothing penetrative. Later in Ep2 it's said the suit has 'built in weaponry', so it seems almost certain that this is, at least, the suit used to kill the Doctor. Still up in the air if it was Melody in the suit. Though it has a life support system, so the person in it doesn't need to be able to live in our planet... at least.

River shoots at the astronaut, and after exhausting her bullets says 'course not'. Of course the gun would have no effect? Perhaps... Astronaut then disappears.

As previously stated in another thread, the gas is provided because 'he said you'd need this'. Did the invite say 'Bring gasoline'? Did he talk to the Doctor about this?

When the doctor comes out of the back room in the diner, [his Tardis is back there.](http://imgur.com/6rbpw)

Amy: ""Why would anyone want to trap us?""
Doctor: ""Lets see if anyone tries to kill us and work backwards.""
Love that line.

Any was pregnant, and then in Ep2, she's ""All better. Turns out I was wrong. I'm not pregnant."" So, she was switched between Ep1 and Ep2. This is the Ep she starts seeing Ms. Eyepatch. 

Picture in the orphanage of Amy holding the baby, happily. Taken at Demon's run? Don't think so. Is this an indication that they will, at some point, find baby Melody?

""Then why did the human race suddenly decide to go to the moon? Because the silence needed a space suit."" Why did they need the space suit? Why was it necessary to get a suite for Melody? It wasn't explained.

Bear in mind that Jack is also an immortal-by-technicality character, just like the Doctor, and yet we know that he is unable to heal or come back from the dead. Surely the Doctor shouldn't have been able to regenerate, as it's pretty much the same thing, right? And the newest episode, the Night Terrors. Why hasn't it mentioned anything about the Miracle? All it would take is some offhand remark about having to live in eternal joint pain from the old lady, or some news broadcast about upcoming recessions, or just something. Why has this not been addressed? I know it's not the same show, but it's the same Whoniverse and timeline. I'd have expected some sort of mention.

In honesty, this even further drives me to think that the world that the Doctor and co. are in isn't our world. I think that with what we know of alternate universes and time streams, as seen by Pete's World and the Dream Lord's world, along with what we know is going to be the last episode, which is set in an alternate dimension, that the Doctor is either still under the effects of the Psychic Pollen, or something of a larger scale.

* Was watching 'Being Human', came across something familiar....
* JACK WINS!
* I thought you guys might enjoy the object of my boredom. Now to create the other 8!
* Bowties... Hey, wait!
* That's actually... incredibly spot-on, Netflix.

If you're like me, seeing so many insanely ambiguous titles drives me absolutely bonkers. Contrast the vagueness of the above with some other examples from today's page. See if you can guess what you would find behind these links:

* Made some dress designs for the 9th-11th doctor a while ago, just thought I'd share.
* This G. K. Chesterton quote reminded me of the Doctor.
* Amy, Doctor, and adorable Dalek cosplay at Dragon*Con. (I'm Amy) 
* The impossible astronaut: Observations
* Sylvester McCoy delivers Matt Smith's Pandorica Opens speech

The difference in clarity is night and day. When I see these (the latter) kind of titles, I know very clearly what I am clicking through to: a who-related quote, a spoiler discussion, etc.

**Takashi Usami**
19 yr. old currently on loan at Bayern Munich from Gamba Osaka. From what I've seen from him, he is exactly what we need. Pacy right winger/forward who can also play through the middle. Good feet and a great right foot. His potential and the fact that he's only 19 means he is spot on for our policy. He would likely be available for under £3m.

[Takashi Usami](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KL6MdTmBJEc)

**Son Heung Min**
19 yr old Korean forward/winger currently with Hamburg. He's a top top talent, highly regarded as the next Cha Bum Kun in Korea. Has a knack for scoring goals out of nothing. Scored 18 goals in 9 preseason games for HSV this summer. Not sure what he would cost, but he does seem to also fit our policy perfectly. Here are a few videos.

&gt;Yes of course see below –
&gt; 
&gt;£35.20 – Replacement Blinds
&gt;£36.00 – Labour
&gt;£17.80 VAT at 20%

So I reply

&gt;Hello,
&gt;
&gt;I'm afraid that the maths doesn't add up. (120% of 35.20) + (120% of 36) = £85.44
&gt;
&gt;80% of 89 is not the same as adding 20% to £71.20.
&gt;
&gt;VAT could only be a maximum £14.24 with the values quoted for the labour and blinds. Can you explain how it was calculated?
&gt;
&gt;80% of 89 is £71.20.
&gt;
&gt;£71.20 is the total price quoted for labour and the blinds. The only way that you could have come to this is by starting at £89 pounds and then choosing two number that fit after 20% was subtracted. If this is what has happened and that £89 pounds is the starting point it makes me very dubious of the values that are being quoted.
&gt;
&gt;Can you provide a more complete breakdown with the actual values. How long are you charging labour for? From whom? What shop did the quote for purchasing the blinds come from? What are the measurements/specifications/brand of the blinds that you have received a quote for?

They reply:

&gt;Obviously we have made a mistake but please do accept our apologises – Please see below
&gt; 
&gt;Blinds - £38.17
&gt;Labour - £36.00
&gt;VAT at 20% - £14.83

Corrected for their maths which is clearly doctored to fit to £89.

So I get the blind sizes from them and I can find them online VAT paid for £31.82 and tell them. I also say that labour is too high, it's ~£45 pounds including VAT for clipping a few new blinds to a rail not some highly skilled specialist job.

They are refusing to move from their £89. I suggested £70 even though this seems high. What should I do? Is it worth taking it to the TDS for £20? I don't like being ripped off. I'm in Manchester by the way if that helps with price estimation.

Edit: It's a flat in a large block all run by the same agency. I am dealing with the agency. They were in the building most days anyway. I have moved out now and this is to come out of my deposit. To reiterate; I'm happy to pay, it's just too much and that the £89 seems to be made up rather than based on actually pricing. 

Edit 2: **Gave Up.** They were definitely over charging but for the sake of £20 I couldn't be bothered writing to the TDS and not getting my deposit back for weeks as I couldn't make any headway with the agency. This sucks but wasting a few weeks of my life worrying about this while I am very busy with other things sucks too. Seemed to me to not be worth it in the end.

Minutes later (apparently, I was at the library) my home phone rang and my brother answered. He told me 'they' rang and I was to be at the Stadium at 6PM Thursday for 'induction' - not 'interview'.

I'm not entirely sure what inductions are. I think they are informal things where applicants are all in a room together with the employer doing teambuilding exercises and stuff? I think they're popular with supermarkets. I know the term is also used in lieu of 'training' like when you start college they ease you in before getting down to actual work.

It will cost me money to get to the stadium - money I don't have. I will lend it from my brother because it is at least worth a try. I have no idea how I will come across, I'm 19 later this month, my hair is down to my shoulders and not very well kept, I have pretty serious bags under my eyes, my skin is pale (more drug addict pale than pure Virgin Mary pale) and my clothes suck. I have no 'smart/casual' wear and can't afford to buy any. I think I will be okay if I find a decent shirt.

In terms of my attitude - god knows. I can't talk about the weather or football. Make a joke about whatever or discuss music. I will definitely come across as a 'nice young man' - old women love me. I'm clearly not going to be kicking a dog anytime soon but I'm not going to be in any heavy social situation either. I wouldn't be able to build a rapport with the customers, those typical working class.

Which brings me to the job itself. I'm 19 next month and I've never had a job. I've had work experience in customer service and I've helped on college open days but that's it. I could do the job but I'm not sure if I could convince them of that (assuming there are other would-employees with me).

College is probably the biggest issue. I failed my AS Levels and got about 8 months through a BTEC course in the new academic year before being suspended. The police got involved and I'd rather not go into more detail. Since I'm working at a football stadium the massive majority of games are on a weekend or late at night on weekdays so there would never be any doubt as to whether college would potentially interfere, however I am worried they will contact the college for some kind of reference and hear about the 'bad thing' I allegedly did.

I never touched on my home life but all that's worth saying is that it's shit. I nearly managed save myself via the education route but I messed up. This job isn't vital - I should be able to start claiming JSA soonish (i wasn't able to before, being a student still) so if all else fails I can start eating decent food for the first time in ages. This is the first time I have actually gotten a request for an interview/induction - fast food chains never even got back to me. Even if this job pays less (which I'm pretty sure it must - min wage for a couple hours work twice a month) I still need it to boost my CV and gain a good reference for the future. Short term loss for long term gain.


I think I've covered everything. I'd rather people focused on the job aspect rather than my home life and the college suspension. I need to know what to expect from an 'induction' and how to get this job. I wish I was some kid that just wanted to pay for clothes, phone bills and nights out but my future rests on this - it's possible I'll spiral into depression and do something silly.

(because I know that many of you lack the ability to read long texts due to abuse internet use and lack of books)
**tl;dr**  'Induction' at football stadium tomorrow for potential role as food+drinks staff on match days. need it for food and silly things like that. howtogetjob?

**UPDATE:** Got it, baby I've got it.

I turned up at the main reception, there were about 30 other people there, vast majority around my age. Some had forms with them which unsettled me a little because I had no idea whether I was supposed to have any. I also noticed people had bank statements and passports at hand. They were almost certainly here to wait for the person I was waiting for but I hated the idea that I was potentially tagging along with a group I had nothing to do with (some kind of school tour or something) so I moseyed on over to the guy at reception whilst people kept their eyes on me, since I was the latest arrival:
""I'm here for an induction with PERSON""
""Yep, she'll be down in a moment""

I then felt silly because it was obvious everyone else was here for the same reason. I was concerned at the number of people here - surely there can't be that many positions available? The football season started in September and the club have already had two home games. Wouldn't they have a batch of people brought in for the new season, plus the regulars?

My fears were alleviated shortly after we were sat down in the press room (I've seen it on TV quite a lot, even though I'm not a football fan I found it cool). It became clear that we would all start work on Saturday. We were shown the 'bars' in which we would work. The opportunity to get comfortable with the tills was presented so I took advantage of that - both for valuable early experience and to show some initiative and enthusiasm. It didn't matter that I had no bank statements or ID with me. I started to worry a bit about having no driving license or passport (at home or elsewhere) but I was told a birth certificate would do. If I bring that plus a bank statement with me on my first day I'll be fine.

I will also be able to claim Jobseekers Allowance since I don't work that many hours. With some actual work experience (which will result in a positive reference later down the line) and some savings from JSA and my wages I should be fine for the forseeable future. Things are finally looking good for me. 

Thanks to everyone that gave me advice and wished me luck. Strictly speaking I didn't need it (I barely had to say a word) but it made me feel much less anxious and it's always nice to see that strangers care.",false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,null,null,self,Somebody rang me in response to a job application.

First, I am starting to believe that there is a possibility that the Doctor for the duration of the series has been a clone of some description. In the first episode, the Doctor had no Tardis. He invited himself to meet everyone - we as the viewer cannot tell whether or not the Doctor is real - as he stressed, they are indistinguishable. Is there a reason for this? It's possible that the Doctor he called is an intentional clone of himself that he's sending to alter his fate.

Second, at the end of the last series, after someone tried to destroy the Tardis, there was a discussion about who would want to do that. The people wanting to kill the Doctor don't seem to have that kind of technology. Given the nature of the Doctor anyway, they should be aware of whether or not they had attempted this, but their plan seems to revolve around River. This suggests there is someone much bigger behind all this, or perhaps the impact on the Tardis was the result of somebody creating a fixed point where the Doctor would die. In terms of the impact on the timeline, it would be significant if events were manipulated in that manner.

I have this feeling everything will tie together, and I'm looking forward to it.",false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,null,null,self,[Likely Spoilers] Interesting potential for this series... [Warned you],6,http://www.reddit.com/r/doctorwho/comments/k7km3/likely_spoilers_interesting_potential_for_this/

From Journey's End (2:30) we know The Doctor can transfer regeneration energy into a handy ""Biomatching Receptacle"".

Everyone has been assuming that in TIA, the Astronaut is River Song. What if it is The Doctor? He starts a regeneration cycle *and transfers the regeneration energy to the version of himself that is dying from poisoning*. He used the space suit to conceal his identity from everyone else.  The newly healed Doctor then goes to meet everyone in the restaurant.

This would explain the ""Mrs. Robinson"" (from the movie The Graduate) call out in the Oval Office. For him it is just a little while since she did the ""Hello Benjamin"" (also from the movie the Graduate) callout in LKH.

It would also imply that The Doctor who shows up in a Tuxedo is from a third point in time. Given that the last time he wore that Tux was Amy's wedding - maybe this one is from The Wedding of River Song where for some other reason he is once again dying.

From what I recall, we first met him in the ""Are you my mummy?"" episodes, and then again when Rose saved his life. Then he was there when the Doctor and Martha went to the end of the universe; he was latched on to the TARDIS (episode Utopia). Am I missing a few others?

I haven't seen Torchwood (yet), so maybe it is further explained in that show?

Also why the fuck is River in prison, and if she did kill the Doctor and that was the reason behind imprisonment... Why was she so shocked when she saw him dying at the lake?

&gt;I'm walking in order to raise money for Meadow House Hospice. This NHS-funded facility recently cared for Elisabeth Sladen, known to many of you as Sarah Jane Smith from the TV series Doctor Who.

&gt;Like many of her fans and friends, I was deeply saddened by Lis' death in April 2011 and I hope to raise as much money as possible for this wonderful cause. More details and a target sum are to follow.

&gt;Starting on Saturday 3 September, I will walk from the BBC's Upper Boat studios in Cardiff (where SJA was filmed), aiming to arrive at the BBC Television Centre (where Lis first filmed Doctor Who) in London the following Friday. I will largely be following the National Cycling Route No. 4 - walking the equivellent of a marathan every day!

Now it's time for me to stop. And tonight I'm going to need you all with me.""

Could it be that the doctor +200 is the ganger from TRF/TAP. Lets say that at the end of TAP the doctors speculation is right and he is able to return from ""melting"" and he is the doctor from LKH who answers the call that amy and rory do - http://i.imgur.com/CTDKC.jpg -. This happens while the real doctor is still out somewhere looking for the baby melody just without his TARDIS (Temporarily). If this is true then it makes what he says in TIA make that much more sense because the ganger doctor would have technically been running for almost all his life and it could explain the missing TARDIS from TIA because the real dotor would be able to just drop him off for his death and then go and do whatever he wanted. (The ganger doctor would have been running from his death, in lake silencio, just realised that i didn't clarify before.)

If this is true then i think i can pose another theory as to why the ganger doctor had to be killed by River; the real doctor failed to find a way to save melody before she had been brainwashed completely and killed the doctor+200, this would be because he became too intricately entwined with evens (and he can't go back on his own timeline) This would mean that in order to un-brainwash her the ganger doctor would have to let her kill him, to complete her mission so she is no longer subject to the brainwashing, then the real doctor, amy and rory would be able to intervene before she gets taken to prison. If it plays out like that then it would break the paradox of the doctor recruiting himself from the past to save melody meaning that the future of river being in prison for life and her and the doctor meeting in the wrong order is gone replaced with an new one where god knows what happens. 

also did anyone else notice that in season 5 when amy first meets river in The Time Of Angels the doctor introduces her; 
AMY:
Aren't you going to introduce us?

DOCTOR:
Amy Pond, Professor River Song.

RIVER:
(faces them) Ahhh, I'm going to be a Professor some day, am I? (the DOCTOR winces at this slip) How exciting! (chuckles) Spoilers! (turns her attention back to what she was doing)

and this is the River who has already killed the doctor beacuse she is in the custody of the clerics for killing ""a good man"", however at the end of LKH we get a glimpse at River going to become an archaeologist before she has gone to prison which means that the River in TTOA would already be an archaeologist and it wouldn't have been a spoiler for her.",false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,null,null,default,Some thoughts on The Impossible Astronaut and The Time Of Angels,2,http://www.reddit.com/r/doctorwho/comments/k830e/some_thoughts_on_the_impossible_astronaut_and_the/

I think I had some idealism left in me during the Clinton years, but when George Bush Jr was elected as I entered high school and for the eight years thereafter, my faith in my government and hope for my nation crumpled up and died.

 I used to think there were things even a CEO or senator wouldn't do -- like stand in front of people dying from my own actions and deny responsibility in a baldfaced lie. I no longer feel that way. It's as if nothing surprises me anymore, and yet I still get surprised -- and appalled, and sickened -- when I see what my politicians are doing, even in so superficial a way as watching the Daily Show or reading the headlines. The hypocrisy and amorality is truly disgusting to me, and yet I don't feel that there's anything I can do, or even help do, to change it.

So when I see the Doctor swoop in and depose the government, or incite a revolution with a few well-placed words... it just hurts. Because in real life, intellect and romance just don't seem to be enough.

So I tried to think of a way to answer everything without going into Gangers at all.  First I started with a list of questions that I think this series will/should answer:

* The TARDIS explodes, we still don't know how exactly
* The question the Silence want answered: When the oldest question hidden in plain sight is asked Silence will fall
* What does Silence will fall mean, why do they keep saying it
* Who killed the Doctor and how was that all set up
* If it was River/Melody why didn't she remember any of it
* Why was the Doctor wearing a tux in LKH
* The Doctor's name, potentially not a plot question but for my theory's purposes it is


I'll start by going through a few basic beliefs for my theory to work:

1) The oldest question hidden in plain sight is what's the Doctor's name?  Seems somewhat dull but I believe naming him would also shed light on the type of person he is - committing dual genocide as well as tampering with many different races just in 11's time but also over the history of the Doctor too. This is meant to incite the anger of the universe against the Doctor

2) Silence will fall is a warning that once this question is answered, the entire universe will cry out for the Doctor's death

3) The Silence (beings) forced River to make the TARDIS explode in the Big Bang. Remember, River was the only one inside the TARDIS when it exploded. We know that something was on the TARDIS to say the ominous, ""Silence will fall"" line that we heard in the Big Bang. And also now knowing the past between the Silence and River makes it a more likely link that she was either still under brainwashed conditioning or directly being controlled. 

Okay now we can get to the actual theory:

The rest of this season will have some interaction between River and the Doctor where River will become more and more like the River we know and less like the psychopath in LKH.  This will all culminate with River Song's wedding to the Doctor.  At the wedding when it appears River has finally fully gotten over her brainwashing and the Doctor is going to answer her question of what's his name....another Doctor will crash the wedding.

The dying Doctor from LKH will pop up. The Silence (beings) that had been hiding/waiting on the Doctor to answer the question will appear in full force now that they suspect the Doctor of tampering.  

-This is where my theory starts to get a bit wonky and I think future episodes could clarify it-

The marrying-Doctor will take advantage of this craziness to explain to the Silence that he knows all about how he is killed.  The LKH-Doctor will record this before tossing the recording to the marrying-Doctor and the two go on their way. The LKH Doctor back to LKH and marrying-Doctor to flee with River, Amy, and Rory.

But wait the Doctor died, right?

Well, wrong.  The Doctor will drop off River, Amy, and Rory then he'll do something really clever to broadcast the video he recorded throughout the universe.  The Doctor sends out the letters to Amy, River, Rory, and Canton before talking to Canton and telling him what he needs to know (gasoline).  This sets up everything in the Impossible Astronaut.  The Doctor then plays the recording for the whole universe to witness causing every species to believe he is dead and then forget why they believe that (because of the Silence).  

What we saw in the Impossible Astronaut is what Amy, Rory, and River experienced having been subjected to this message - that's why the Doctor is able to match River's every memory of him because it's her projection of who the Doctor is.  The Doctor then ""dies"" and the Silence stands on the ledge nearby realizing that this was all fake.  

*Short break to point out why it makes more sense that it was fake than Gangers or other theories: 

-The Doctor left coordinates in the envelopes then why did Rory, Amy, and River meet in the middle of no where while the Doctor (one who doesn't die) shows up in the diner? If he was trying to go to the coordinates why would he stop to get a soda?

-Amy and Rory arrive at the spot to see nothing around them, yet a minute later they are in a diner that wasn't on the horizon

-The Doctor (one who dies) shows up without a TARDIS but with a car, yet the car is never seen again

-When the Doctor and River are matching diaries, the Doctor never tries to figure out where River is. It's always River saying things to the Doctor (all of which he remembers)

-The Doctor's body is burned so other aliens won't be able to come looking for proof

-It's the Astronaut that kills the Doctor so the universe will associate his death with River while River won't because she knows she didn't

Now back to my theory explanation, this will also cause the Silence to lose their greatest weapon of revealing the Doctor's name to cause outrage because everyone now believes the Doctor is dead. Remember the Silence don't use weapons they make other races their weapons (as the Silence being said before Canton shot him in DotM). 

This will also weaken his standing in the universe as he died without a fight, allowing the Doctor to return to the true nature of his travels (something River bashed him for getting away from in AGMGTW). The universe still believes River killed the Doctor even though she didn't and to make up for that the Doctor breaks her out of jail (the first time she gets out), marries her, and tells her his name. 

I know the end of my theory is very wonky, and I recognize that, but felt it was something different than much of what has been discussed.  I also hope the upcoming episodes will contribute some major factor that will help correct my theory

(For the mods) Is there any way we could get the CL matches to show up in the upcoming fixtures sidebar in addition to the prem schedule?

2. I hadn't realized this mid week game until now. How do you guys think it will effect the selection for the sunderland game and the manchester united game? Do we rest some players against leverkusen?    Who?

With the international break here are a few things to consider...

Mikel played the full 90 in both of Nigeria's matches

Malouda played 82 minutes in the earlier game over the break (Last friday i think?)

Mata played 90 minutes this week

Lukaku played about 90 minutes over the course of two games

Lampard played about 85 minutes total over two games

Romeu played just about two full games

Meireles played in portugals first match

McEachran, Sturridge did not play...

Luiz, bosingwa, alex were the only defenders who didn't play a buttload but our defenders are ironmen so we should be okay. 

I know its the beginning of the season and fatigue shouldn't be as big an issue but we want to be as fresh AND as  cohesive as possible for ManU. What i'm thinking we will do for both the sunderland and leverkusen games is start with a full strength squad, or maybe meireles will get the start for the sunderland game. This way we can hope to establish early leads, then make early substitutions with players like mceachran, meireles. sturrnelkalou will prob get some sort of rotation going. 

Does anyone have any insight as to what formation/style leverkusen play?

Which of these games do you guys think Mata/sturridge will get starts in?

**tl;dr at the end**
_________

Planned drastic reorganisation of the profession of Public Service Interpreters in the UK could lead to decline of the profession, miscarriages of justice and will have a degrading effect on our ability to sustain a culturally diverse society and even compete in the global marketplace.

On 5 July 2011 the UK’s Ministry of Justice announced that it would award an exclusive contract to a private company, “Applied Language Solutions” to provide translation and interpreting services for the legal system of the United Kingdom. In essence, this contract demolished the national practice of commissioning interpreters’ jobs directly to the freelance professional interpreters registered in the well-established National Register of Public Service Interpreters (NRPSI). In times of austerity this radical departure from a well-functioning system is portrayed as a market-driven money saver, quality enhancer and efficiency builder. Is it, really? 

For many years the NRPSI was synonymous with high standards of quality. Registered public service interpreters are an elite cohort of language professionals, most of them with prestigious university degrees, who have taken specialised training courses to work in the legal system, passed multiple rigorous exams and worked for hundreds of hours as interpreters to qualify. 

NRPSI interpreters provide their service on a freelance basis, which saves legal services a lot of money: they do not have to keep staff interpreters on permanent payrolls or offer freelancers the opportunity to join public workers’ pension schemes.  Interpreters earn their living by taking jobs when they are called upon. For instance, under the present system a NRPSI interpreter working for the Police would be paid directly by the constabulary. The rate will depend on day of the week and time of day. Working on public holidays and late at night - and there are a lot of such assignments in police practice - is rewarded best. Interpreters are also reimbursed for travel to what are unpredictable destinations. This could be a police station, a private house or a scene of crime, in the middle of nowhere and in the middle of night. To accommodate the unpredictable nature and duration of police jobs, interpreters receive a minimum payment in the rare occasions when the job turns out to be shorter than expected.    

“Applied Language Solutions” have been able to convince the Ministry of Justice that a more simple system when interpreters are paid not by the Police or any other part of the legal system but through “Applied Language Solutions” at a fixed hourly rate whatever day, time or place, is a better deal for the government. The non-negotiable rate offered by “Applied Language Solutions” to the NRPSI interpreters is between one third and two thirds of the Police rates. Their simple system also conveniently abolishes the reimbursement of travel costs and minimum payments. The “Applied Language Solutions” will take care of charging the legal services, at undisclosed rates, for the service provided and will make their business by pocketing the difference. 

No wonder that the interpreting community is in shock and disbelief. Imagine that one day your boss tells you with a smile: ‘We are now going to pay you for the same job three times less than you have been paid so far and when we post you to work in a different town, you will pay for your own travel.’

This is where it is becoming a serious issue with serious implications to this country which we have to examine. Closing down the National Register of Public Service Interpreters and awarding its function to the private company ‘Applied Language Solutions’ (ALS) may be objected on several grounds.

To start with, public service interpreting is in fact an integral part of legal service and any substantial change in interpreters’ pay rates and conditions should be the subject of a broad consultation and a full pay review. It appears that interpreting is the only profession within the public service spectrum where pay rates are being cut so dramatically. This is deeply unfair. One could argue that Public Service Interpreters are attacked because they are an easy target as they are freelance workers not represented by trade unions. 

It is inappropriate and in fact anti-market to consolidate both the service provision and the quality assessment in the hands of a single private company. This is a clear example of a conflict of interests. ALS may perhaps defend their position by insisting that assessment is commissioned to an independent body, the Middlesex University. This needs to be scrutinised. Who pays Middlesex University for this adjudication service? How was Middlesex University selected for the job? Was there a proper tender process? Have other national centres of language excellence been invited to participate in the tender? And, most importantly, what exactly is the rationale (in times of austerity!) for a hugely costly national-level re-assessment of registered public service interpreters apart from such re-examination being a part of bullying tactics intended to force registered interpreters to sign up with ALS?

Moreover, one could fear, the pressure to deliver contracted service to the MOJ could lead to approval of ill-qualified interpreters ready to work for highly discounted rates if registered public service interpreters boycott ALS. Appointing a single private company to provide this national service should be examined as a possible violation of the Competition Commission’s rules on monopolies and potential unfair profiteering at the expense of the profession. 

The issues of pay may be a concern for NRPSI interpreters, but it is in the public interest that this small, disjoined and vulnerable group of individuals is not made a scapegoat of the spending review. A drastic reduction of pay rates (up to three times in some cases!) will have a detrimental impact on the translation industry as a whole and talented people will leave the profession. This will have impact not only on the Ministry of Justice itself through lowering the quality of language services provision, with inevitable miscarriages of justice, but it will also hamper publishing, media, the tourism industry and the Foreign Office.

The decline of the profession of translators and interpreters will have a huge negative effect on the popularity of school and university language courses and humanities in general. This will irreversibly hamper our ability to sustain a culturally diverse society and to face international competition in the global marketplace.

It appears that in this case, the Ministry of Justice has sadly mishandled the situation. Awarding the contract to “Applied Language Solutions” should be reverted and a proper consultation of all interested parties should begin.

**tl;dr: Changes to employment conditions of UK-based professional interpreters and translators with top-tier qualifications who provide services to police, the UK Government and the Home Office are about to change. This will result in unqualified individuals taking these jobs, and thus inevitably the miscarriage of justice. No official consultation process was used in making this decision.**

This was my first burn, with a friend's dance camp. I built a yurt and it's *awesome,* big (16ft diameter, 8ft tall at the top) and conveniently hexagonal and makes me think of the TARDIS console room. The camp in front of us built a huge geodesic shade dome and it didn't look too hard.

**Idea:** Camp TARDIS; the camp by/for Companions. Disguise yurt as something appropriate (what would a TARDIS with functioning chameleon circuit appear as, if it landed at Burning Man?), put it under a shade dome. Decorate the shade dome with carpets and drapes and metal panels and blinky things/switches/etc. Add sofa's, dress in anachronistic historical costumes, offer Sonic Screwdriver drinks, play Who-themed or Who-appropriate music.
Inside the yurt: decorate like a TARDIS console room, add cushions, a swamp cooler, and a very well dust-protected projector (still figuring that part out), and have new and classic episodes showing all day.

So far I've found tickets at online broker websites for around $300 each which seems a bit ridiculous. There are some tickets on the London section of Craigslist for 140 GBP, but I don't really trust the postings.

So my questions are:

1. Where is the best place for me to get a pair of reasonably priced tickets?

2. How much should I expect to pay?

3. If I have a choice, what section in the stadium should I choose? (spurs fan obviously)

I was wondering if you could offer some help.

My boyfriend is off to university at Edge Hill in Ormskirk and he's in urgent need of a room to stay in as freshers starts on the 19th of September. Currently, all of our efforts to find anything have come up empty and now both he and myself are starting to get pretty worried.

If anyone knows of any websites we could look at or knows of anyone with a spare room either in parts of liverpool closer to Ormskirk or in Ormskirk itself, could you please please post a response. We're getting desperate. It's his first year at uni and he got in through clearing, so we've not really had much of a choice on the housing front. If anyone could offer ANY help or advice, it would be really really appreciated.

If you've details that you don't want to share on reddit, please pm me and I'll give you my e-mail address. I'm clutching at straws here and I hope the wonderful people of r/liverpool can help.

Thanks!

Seeing as Rex is seemingly immortal now it's possible that it could be him that becomes the Face of Bo and not Jack. The only lead I'm aware of that ties Jack to being Bo is the offhand comment about him being a poster boy whilst growing up in the Boeshane Peninsula. Now that we have two immortals who presumably age under the same conditions it could be either of them who ends up being Bo.

Yes, if he scores 20 goals this season it will be massive. If we get 10 from Defoe and 10 from VDV as well we make the CL. But(!), what I was impressed by was his ability to hold the ball. ALL of our other strikers (and Crouch was abysmal at it) have a hard time holding the ball for the counter or if anything just keep possession.

1: Is the quality there?

2: Is the drive to provide cheap prices eventually going to do a reverse turn when the supermarkets eliminate their competition from smaller stores who can't compete and then just raise the prices to what they want?

Remember that episode?  In the end, it turned out that Chloe was an alien called an ""Isolus.""  Let's look at their descriptions:

Both are from space.  When a member of either race comes down to earth, they become (in one way or another) a child in a human family.  They then both attempt to fit in with humans, and want nothing more than to be accepted.  If and when they are not, they use their terrible powers, although not intentionally, to harm those around them, particular those who bother them the most.

Let's compare Chloe and George.  They both have that which they fear most hidden in a cupboard in their bedrooms.  They both appear to be normal human children, although seem very odd to their parents.  They are both aliens with powers that are used unintentionally to harm people.

I admit there are some differences.  For example, the Isolus merely posses human children, whereas Tenza pretend to be them.  Isolus normally do not do this, Chloe was a rare case.  Tenza, however, do this to raise their young.  With these differences in mind, why not simply plant hints that George is an Isolus, rather than a race that has yet to be introduced, then make that the ending?  As I had not seen Fear Her in ages, I had to check the wiki before I realized that the Tenza and Isolus were two different things.

The lyrics to Abigail's Song...

    When you're alone, silence is all you know.
    When you're alone, silence is all you know
    Let in the noise and let it grow. 

    When you're alone, silence is all you see
    When you're alone, silence is all you'll be
    Give me your hand and come to me. 

    When you are here, music is all around.
    When you are near, music is all around.
    Open your eyes, don't make a sound. 

    Let in the shadow, let in the shadow,
    Let in the light of your bright shadow. 

    Let in the shadow, let in the shadow.
    Let in the light of your bright shadow. 

    Let in the light.
    Let in the light.
    Let in the light of your sweet shadow. 

    When you're alone, oh,
    Silence is all you know.
    Silence is all,
    Silence is all around.
    Silence is all
    Silence is all around

The last verse is what really caught my attention. Happy coincidence or them just being their clever selves?

I am an international student moving to England on the 19th and I will be covered under the NHS. I am due to start my next birth control pill pack on the 29th of September but I don't have another one.

So, the questions...

1. I'd love to get an IUD but my boyfriend thinks I might have to wait some time for that one. How does the NHS handle IUDs? Long waitlist?

2. If I can't get an IUD before the pack runs out, I don't mind taking the pill for a few months. How long do you think I would have to wait for an appointment? I will have to register at the local hospital first, do you think I'd have to wait to get my national insurance card for an appointment or a prescription?

3. Should I go to the university hospital in my city or to the Contraception and Sexual Health Clinic? 

4. My university has a ""registration for medical care"" day for international students but that's at the end of September. Does this mean I can't register at another hospital?

It just feels like it's ruining the point of regeneration, you know? Like, turning it from the ability to cheat death, except in a few unusual circumstances, to the ability to cheat death in a few unusual circumstances!

The doctor cannot recover from:

* Being shot whilst regenerating  
* Being burnt to death  
* More or less every poison mentioned  
* Also basically every disease mentioned

Examples:
-Impossible Astronaut/Day of the Moon: Creepy slowly moving spacesuit (like the Vashta Nerada in Silence in the Library/Forrest of the Dead), you're only safe when looking at your enemies (like the Weeping angels), creepy writing suddenly appearing all over your body (Like Toby being possessed in Impossible Planet/Satan Pit)

-Curse of the Black Spot: You think people are being disintegrated but they're really being teleported! (Exactly like the game shows in Bad Wolf)*

-Night Terrors: The plot is just a much better executed version of Fear Her

-The Girl Who Waited: Alien Doctors who do more harm than good to humans (like the siren in Curse of the Black Spot), companion abandoned for a long period of time even though its only been a few minutes for the others (just like Amy's hallucination of Rory in The Doctor's Wife)

Has anyone else seen this? I'm not saying the series is ruined because of all of this things, as they are being used in new (and frequently better) ways. But its still bugging me that these episodes can feel so familiar.

**Titles should never contain spoilers**.

**All posts about new episodes** are considered spoilers until *48 hours* after the episode airs on BBC.  (7:10PM Saturday UK time) [Look here](http://www.google.com/search?q=time+in+london) for current UK time and compare to your own.

**All references to unaired episodes are spoilers.**  Not everyone watches the previews, because they want to be surprised when the episode airs - please respect that.

**If a post clearly labels which episode it's about** (e.g.  ""Spoilers for The Girl Who Waited""), you can expect that there will be spoilers about that episode in that post.  Use of the spoiler tag is *not* necessary for discussion of that episode or before.  *Discussion of future episodes should be tagged.*

**If a post does not clearly identify which episode it's discussing** (e.g.  ""DAE think that... [spoilers]""), then all spoilers should be tagged.  

Feel free to add questions, and we'll answer and update this post.

Also we didn't see old Amy die, the ganger Doctor speculated that he could somehow survive, and we don't know what happened to the Tesselecata.

I don't necessarily think this is going to be significant but the potential is there and we are talking about Moffatt. If the finale has multiple versions of all the characters at least I can say I called it though!

There's also the discrepancy where, in The Impossible Astronaut, the Doctor is magically 200 years older than he was before.

Think about the line in TGWW where the Doctor says that knowing one's future can prompt them to change it.  The Doctor knows his future from The Almost People.  In Let's Kill Hitler, he sees the date of his death on the Tesselecta's database.  

What's to say that 1,100-year-old Doctor doesn't go back to the date of his death (and likely a few important places before that) to set it up so that 900-year-old Doctor goes through the events we have seen so far, ultimately changing the outcome, causing the 1,100-year-old Doctor we've seen to never exist?

My opinion is:

- I do not believe the gubbins we have been told by the American Government.

- I do not follow or believe entirely any conspiracies I have seen. 

- I believe there *were* bombs in the WTC, at least definitely in the basement. I'm 99% sure the planes alone did not bring the towers down.

- I believe that whether or not the US government did or did not have some underhand in allowing the attacks to happen, there has been two other countries invaded due to piggybacking people's fear after 11/9.  There has also been the biggest loss of human rights post 11/9 and the instillation of everyone fearing everyone.

- Yesterday (as American Reddit pointed out) was more of a 'reminder' of fear. If the service was truly about America and its people, the service would have been lead by those who were first to respond. Not some fancy politicians.

- The whole event is far too quaint for me to willingly accept without a lot of holes being filled.

Yes, if anyone joins through that link I get some free credit. If you don't want to go through the referral, just go to giffgaff.com

I was on O2 til recently and I found giffgaff which uses O2's network but is much cheaper. I only use their £10 ""goodybag"" but it gets me what I want, much cheaper than O2. Unlimited mobile data, unlimited UK texts and 250 minutes to any number for £10 a month. I'm broke as fuck and I was paying £7.50 a month for not unlimited data on O2 that I then found out they changed to £6 but never told me, and it was a fiver for unlimited texts and calls were just at normal rates, so I've saved a nice bit, especially since they were charging me £1 a day for data when I went over the allowance.

Switching your existing number is easy. You just need to call your current provider and ask for a PAC code then do it online through giffgaffs site. Also you activate your sim online, you don't need to call any numbers or anything, One thing if anyone does try em out, you need an unlocked phone for when they send you your free sim. I don't know much about unlocking but I understand that (depending on your model) you can get unlock codes off ebay for pennies.

Anyway yeah, maybe some of you UK guys can save a bit on your network. As I said above, you DON'T HAVE to give me a referral bonus.

I knew that the UK is full of many accents before this, but I hadn't quite seen it in action. After watching quite a lot of QI ... Yowza! I was hoping someone could explain about the various accents, where they're from, what they mean to you, etc, I'd be grateful. If you need to see just who I've been hearing, [this list](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QI#Multiple_guest_appearances) is probably a good place to start (plus Stephen Fry and Alan Davies, obviously). To get you started, I guess I'd list Ross Noble and Johnny Vegas as being the most difficult to understand for me (though I've gotten a lot better at it). Notable accents include Lee Mack? I'm never sure if I can hear any Welsh accent in Rob Brydon or not.

The best description is probably the one on the [Wikipedia page for Reddit](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reddit). Basically Reddit is a link sharing site, where any users can submit posts, and the rest of the users can then Upvote, Downvote and comment on these posts. 

**Upvote? Downvote?**  
  
Upvoting and Downvoting is what makes Reddit Reddit! next to every post there are two arrows, one pointing up and one pointing down. If you feel the content of the post is of good quality, then you may honour that post with an Upvote. If you think that the post content is of poor quality, then you can Downvote. Some magical behind the scenes maths then places posts with greater votes nearer the top. UP/Downvoting is **NOT** for use based on opinion. If you have a differing opinion to that of the post, consider writing a comment to express your opposing view. Please read the official Reddit [page on ""Reddiquette""](http://www.reddit.com/help/reddiquette) for more info. 
  
   
**Subreddits and the Lufbra subreddit **   
 
Reddit is divided up into ""subreddits,"" which are usually based around a particular theme, activity or place. For example, there is [/r/pics](http://www.reddit.com/r/pics) for pictures, [/r/london](http://www.reddit.com/r/london) for London, [/r/todayilearned](http://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned) where users post interesting facts that they've learned. The subreddit for Loughborough University is [/r/lufbra](http://www.reddit.com/r/lufbra). If you wish to post in any subreddit, or vote on submissions, you will need a Reddit account. Once you've registered, you will be able to choose what subreddits you are subscribed to, by clicking the +/-frontpage button in the right sidebar.   


**And finally**  

Congratulations! You've managed to read the brief intro to Reddit and /r/lufbra. Please read the post regarding [subreddit rules and User flair](http://www.reddit.com/r/lufbra/comments/kd7ox/rlufbra_rules_and_user_flair_requests/), that way everyone can make the most of /r/lufbra, and it makes the mods lives much much easier! If you need any more help, there is plenty of info in the[ Reddit help section](http://www.reddit.com/help/).

For that reason, I think I need to publicly retract anything I've said about Karen Gillan's acting abilities, based on her role as Old Amy in ""The Girl Who Waited."" The make-up, I thought, was very good (hair aside), but she made me believe that Amy had changed, *really* changed, in those 36 years. She made me feel all the years of fighting for survival, remaining constantly alert, and always alone. She was not just Amy with wrinkles, she really was a different Amy, which I think was essential for making us feel bad for leaving her behind. Watching her pain, we developed a sympathy for her separate from that of Young Amy. When she was left behind, an entirely different person died, and knowing that Young Amy was going to be ok was not enough to ease that knowledge.

Like anything, there are a few rules that have to be laid out, so please read and adhere to them.  

* ** DO NOT** post other people's personal information. Anyone who does so will likely face an immediate ban. 
* No hateful/spiteful/racist/defamatory or otherwise mean comments or posts. If in doubt, it's probably best to play it safe and not bother.
* Do submit good quality content. As long as it is to do with the university or perhaps something within the town, then that's fine. 
* No commercial advertising. Students are permitted to advertise items for sale. (Please note any transactions organised through the subreddit are the sole responsibility of **YOU**. Remember to always exercise caution.)
* Do not attempt to impersonate others. In particular Mods and University Staff. 
* If you have an issue, please use the Message the moderators link on the right hand side.   
  
**A few Notes**  

* On every subreddit there is a spam filter. Like any puppy with a new ball, it is notorious for getting overexcited and filtering out legitimate posts. If your post has not appeared in the new queue, or seems to have disappeared, please send a message to the mods, **INCLUDING A LINK TO YOUR POST.** We may be pretty awesome, but psychic we are not.

* In the incredibly unlikely event that there is any sort of dispute. A group decision made by the mods will be final.

**User Flair**  
  

User flair is a way to add short bits of text after your username in a single subreddit. To see some examples, have a look at some of the Moderators usernames on the right. If you want your own username to have some flair on the Lufbra subreddit (or you would like your current flair to be edited or removed), then please click one of the following mods names to send them a message. You may include as little or as much detail as you want, none of the fields are compulsory, and feel free to suggest other fields.

I am about to emigrate to United Kingdom with only about 500£ in my pocket. I am 18 years old without any qualifications (some work experience here and there) and I have about 1 month of preparation left. Without boring you with more intricate details of my life (I will gladly share them if you're curious) I have a few questions:

I heard that it is very hard to find a job in the UK. I really couldn't care less about the quality of the job, so would it be possible for me to find any job before I run out of money?

If it were to come to this, how hard is the homelessness in the UK? I read a lot of stories about people, who are unable to stand the rough sleep any longer, being departed back to their countries and it is the last thing I want to do. 

I will greatly appreciate any insight and will gladly answer any questions you might have.

Not only that but she had shown that in 36 years she became quite the capable scientist/warrior both in her fighting and ability to reprogram the hand-bots. This puts Amy in a very strange situation as The Doctor is fully aware of Amy's potential as, for lack of a better word, a weapon.

This got me thinking about 7 and how much The Doctor was like this past incarnation and has been so far. He's shown that he's manipulative in his own way. He lies. He plans things out well in advance and keeps people in the dark. Was what The Doctor said about Ace in Curse of Fenric how he truly felt and that Ace was just a tool in his defeating Fenric?

If you look back to this past series you'll realize that Amy and Rory are still with The Doctor not due to friendship but because they play a role in the grand scheme. They only came back into The Doctor's life because of Future Doctor who was aware of the circumstances. Current Doctor wanted to drop them back off at home until Amy essentially convinced The Doctor to look into Canton. From there she was most likely kidnapped and replaced with a Ganger, which The Doctor was aware of at some point. It was in his interest to save her. By the time he finally did he would then learn that River Song is their daughter Melody. Now, like Future Doctor, Current Doctor knows how they fit into the grand scheme and he HAS to keep them by his side. This may be a cynical way of looking at things, but I think it's safe to say that 11 is in so many ways like 7.

I know I'm not the first to come up with outlandish Doctor Who theories, but I am beginning to think that eyes are going to play a large role in the finale, although I have no clue as to how!

Back in the Flesh episodes (Of which there has been at least one subtle reference to recently) 'the eyes' were mentioned, which were then found on a wall, but not much was made of them, apart from them being ""the last thing to go"". There was then the 'eyepatch' lady (Madame Kovarian I believe), which I'm aware is a tentative link at best! So if I'm including that I should mentione

However, in 'Night Terrors' Rory and Amy found a giant eye, which went unexplained but was made quite noticeable. And then, in 'the Girl Who Waited' the Doctor makes a quip about the hand bots, something along the lines of ""Why not just give them eyes?"".

Does anyone else think I'm on to something here, or am I going mad? Also, while I'm nerding out on the internet, does anyone think there could be a connection between the interface and the mainframe in charge of the headless monks? That one is a complete stab in the dark though!
