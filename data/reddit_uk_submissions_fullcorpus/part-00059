I'm starting phase one on my son's new bedroom (we hope... once we buy the house).  Our dream is a Dr. Who bedroom.  The plan is involving a transformation of his ikea bunkbed into the tardis.

Please keep in mind that while handy with power tools, I am a single mother and not about to risk losing a limb or breaking my budget (especially when I'm buying a house already).

And no worries, we've agreed that the only monsters in the room will be daleks (can you imagine trying to sleep with a weeping angel in the room!).  I'm hoping to get him a telescope from Craig's list (if I can find one cheep), hang objects (don't know what yet) from the ceiling with fishwire and DIY some spacey lamps :)   ....   and if we can manage it, form some awesome LEGO structure in relation to the theme!

I'm one of the many new faces at UKC and perhaps one of the perhaps familiar faces of /r/mfa (ok perhaps not, lurking probably ranks higher than posting so far for me.)

Anyway, I was wondering if any of you guys or gals had recommendations for where to have clothing tailored in Canterbury? I've got a suit that's a little long in the arms and it'd be great to have them taken in a little before the freshers ball on Saturday. So, google searches having returned very little I turn to you, the friendly folks of /r/canterbury to perhaps point me in the direction of a reputable local tailor.

Big appreciation for anyone that is able to help with this. Thanks in anticipation. :)

Update: I was in town today and spoke to one of the gents in a suit shop (on the same road as the cathedral's main gate) and he recommended the West Gate cleaners.

I want to see peoples opinions on who gets a start at the Bridge on Wednesday. Lets discuss formations and tactics for our match against the Italian Champs.

MY starting XI:

Cech

Ivanovic, Cahill, Terry, Cole

Mikel, Ramires

Hazard, Oscar, Mata

Torres

This is the line-up I would like to see but it's not going to happen. I don't think Robbie is going to give Oscar his first start in the Champs League or drop Lampard in a game where his experience will be so vital. I also rate Cahill higher than Luiz but that's just personal opion.

The darkness is coming, the titles getting darker, Lights not working properly, I think it's leading to some huge event. That much we all know is clear, But the darkness I think is coming.... Is the doctor. Very slowly as we've all noticed, he's become less and less the happy quirky man who ALWAYS tries to save everyone and more of a ""I'm the doctor, it's how I say it is"". This is first clear in ""waters on Mars"" where he tries to save the captain even though he knows she has to die, and even in the last few episodes for instance, DOaSS he makes sure the pirate dies, and in ATCM he even goes so far as to be willing to shoot a man in front of a crowd or even just force him to his doom by the gun-slinger. So, my theory is that his moral compass is slowly dying so to say and he's going to become a very dark person soon, or at least he will have the opportunity to become very dark.

i kept thinking about these things and it occurred to me, watching the eleventh hour about the cracks. the doctor says ""this is two points in space and time that should never have touched.""

however, series 5 wraps up without actually explaining HOW or WHAT those points in space and time are.

what if: in order to save amy and rory from altering history the doctor causes this knit in time; we know the angels pop you back in time and let you live to death. anyone who's seen anything from series 5 will know this conditional clause does not apply to rory. so amelia will have to live to death. based on that premise the doctor folds space and time and causes the cracks, insofar as in doing so the angels cannot take the pond back beyond their lifetimes. if it were rory (which i am nearly sure it won't be) they'd have to take him back beyond 102ad. but that would be a futile effort. with amy they can take her back reasonably far, but i'm betting the fold in time prevents them from taking her back too far, and effectively makes Amy her own aunt, whom she lived with in that old house, but who was out the night Amy met the doctor.

admittedly i havent searched much about this, and am not quite at my sharpest just now, having had a few of the funny pops.

What story do you give him? 


*I'll go first, I guess.*


*When the Master brought the Time Lords out of the Time Lock, a possibility occured: the Could've Been King could have also escaped. It was a narrow chance, just enough that the King could capitalize on it, and he has begun building a new empire in London. He is a creature that survives on Possibility, crafting his army from the might-haves and the maybes from every choice we make that would normally fracture off into infinite new realities.*


*He pulls the strings of possibility to confound the Doctor away from his TARDIS by bringing back companions lost and never were. While the Doctor tries to figure out who is real and who is not (while dealing with all-too-real personal issues between them), the King uses one of the Neverwere to steal the TARDIS and builds a paradox machine powerful enough to collapse entire realities together, making him more powerful than ever, and forcing the Doctor to confront him.*



*When the Could've Been King tries to tap into the Doctor's possibilities, looking for his darkness, maybe a possible ally, he creates a plethora of Doctors. Some come from the past, (What if the Fourth Doctor had never died? And yes, Ten, too.) some have never been seen (What if the Doctor was a woman? Or a ginger? Or a child? Or Benedict Cumberbatch?), and others have been hinted at (the Valeyard, for instance, or the Doctor Donna). The Ninth makes a comment questioning the King's intelligence, and the horde of Doctors and companions work together to take the King and his Army of Neverwere and Meanwhiles down. The paradox machine is disassembled, we say a bunch of tearful goodbyes, and realities collapse back into their normal run-of-the-mill singularity.*

An extremely important character has been thus far neglected this season.  Of course I'm referring to the TARDIS.  Oh yea she's made brief cameos here and there.  However, in previous seasons she has lead the charge into the next mysterious adventure.  Sure it was formulaic but also comforting.

If you've seen the 1996 film Doctor Who, then you are aware that the doctor is said to be half-human. (which by the way, would make an absolutely brilliant idea to continue and develop in the new series.) I personally have not seen too much of the classic series, so as far as I know, there wasn't really a mentioning of this prior to the film (please correct me if I'm wrong.) Many have tried figuring this whole ordeal out and so now, I will give you the best explanation I have been able to find. (Please note that this is just an educated guess using context clues and other things, this is not a for sure explanation.) One theory about this whole thing is that his surgery had gone wrong and caused him to become half-human in his next regeneration (as the 8th doctor.) Another is that this was just a weird mentioning and it would become something absolutely frikin awesome in the later series. And my personal thought is that the second option is correct. And now for the evidence behind the theory. The Master had found out that the doctor was half-human when he observed the doctor's retinal strucure, which I believe was the first mentioning of him being half-human. And the doctor had also said to that scientist guy (whatever his name is) that he was half-human on his mothers side. And frankly, after his regeneration, if his surgery had gone wrong, there would've been no time for him to find out that he had changed. Not to mention he said he was half-human on his mothers side. So that proves the first theory wrong. If you have other thoughts or ideas on this, let me know! And if you happen to know someone who works with the BBC or Doctor Who, please tell them to bring this idea back! The story would be incredible, and not to mention a heck of a twist.

Now there are only three people in the entire Whoniverse that could possibly know The Doctor's name. That kid from the Family of Blood (I may have gotten the title wrong, it's the one where The Doctor willingly loses his memory), The Master, and River Song. 
So They go off to find River and somehow the Angels get involved (maybe they're part of The Silence), and in the process it is revealed to everyone that Rory is The Master (including Rory himself). So we have a consolidation of all the popular theories: Rory is the Master, Silence will fall in The Angels Take Manhattan, And the lightbulbs as it will certainly be a dark day when The Doctor cannot remember his own name.

I don't have the patience to sit through 26 years of t.v seasons just to get this show that everyone likes.

- How important is the original series to the current running one? Are the previous doctors and plotlines essential to the current 2005 onward run?

- Are the changing doctors just switching actors or are they actual independent entities with their own story arcs?

- I don't have cable as I'm in the midst of preparing to move. I only have the internet (with Hulu), so where could I go to watch the show?

oh and sorry if someone already said all of this but just in case here we go

So I was just able to watch the episode because I was out of town Saturday and I noticed a few things...


1. The cowboy hat...I mean hello the stetson in the beginning of season 6 when all of this silence stuff started. This is actually the first thing I saw because it reminded me of the astronauts...which brings me to the numbers

2. Those numbers on the wall of the church
68
7 76
9 31
3 02 

3. I also noticed the signs on the buildings in town, I mean let's be honest studios can reuse props but a few of them stuck out enough that if they weren't supposed to be there then they would have repainted them..The **""Photo Studio""** and the **""Grand Central""** signs. There was also a hotel sign and a saloon sign with 3 dice (and for the record I am 90% sure each one had 7 dots). 

Alright so back to the numbers 

**68**...in 1968 a [pretty famous photo](http://digitaljournalist.org/issue0309/lm11.html) was taken by 2 astronauts from the Apollo 8 orbit. ""Captured on Christmas Eve, 1968, near the end of one of the most tumultuous years the U.S. had ever known, the Earthrise photograph inspired contemplation of our fragile existence and our place in the cosmos.""

This makes sense since season 6 begins with the crew returning to 1969 *(with the cowboy hat)* AND helps incorporate the Christmas theme we keep hearing about. 

Now there is **7 76**...Sticking with the space theme on July 1976:
""NASA commemorated the Bicentennial by staging a science and technology exhibit housed in a series of geodesic domes in the parking lot of the Vehicle Assembly Building (VAB) called Third Century America. NASA originally planned for Viking 1 to land on Mars on July 4, but the landing was delayed to July 20th, the anniversary of the Apollo 11 lunar landing."" 
[The Viking's orbiter](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viking_1) was equipped with a few cameras, again hinting at the photo theme.

Ok so **9 31** is where I think the photo studio sign comes into play because 1931 is when the strobe light was turned into basically what becomes the flash for a camera. Also, could have something to do with the blinking lights.

Which leads us to **3 02**:
""[STS-109](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STS-109) was a Space Shuttle mission that launched from the Kennedy Space Center on 1 March 2002. It was the 108th mission of the Space Shuttle program, the 27th flight of the orbiter Columbia and the fourth servicing of the Hubble Space Telescope."" 
This mission is also known for the addition of the ""Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS), new rigid Solar Arrays (SA3), new Power Control Unit (PCU) and a new Cryocooler for the Near Infrared Camera and Multi-Object Spectrometer (NICMOS)"" to craft. 

Finally the ""Grand Central Bank"" sign in the episode...As everyone knows the last episode for Rory and Amy was shot in NYC. According to [this](http://www.hypable.com/2012/04/13/doctor-who-filming-on-new-york-city-streets-with-vintage-cars-spoilers/) is it was shot right outside of Grand Central Station. And according to the Newspaper Amy reads in Central park the Detroit Lions won the Super Bowl which has never happened but they did win the NFL Championship Game in 1935 fitting with the episodes time period. 

The only thing I can think to link this back into the photo history is that [it says](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Central_Terminal)""From 1939 to 1964 CBS occupied a large portion of the terminal building, particularly above the main waiting room. The space contained four studios (41–44), network master control, film projection and recording, and facilities for local station WCBS-TV."" including John Glenn's 1963 space mission. OR going back to the signs there was a hotel sign and apparently 
""There is a ""secret"" platform, number 61, under the station. This was used only once to convey President Franklin D. Roosevelt directly into the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel. This platform was part of the original design of the Waldorf Astoria.""

This is a reach and I know I am missing things but it is a start...maybe? Thoughts?",false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,null,null,self,Ok so I have a theory...(*Spoilers*7x03),31,http://www.reddit.com/r/doctorwho/comments/100fhs/ok_so_i_have_a_theoryspoilers7x03/

So I have broken down the costs;

Initial Costs
* Used Bus 7k-10k 
* Conversion Fee 5k-8k
* Total 12-18k

Running costs 
* Land rental 50 a month
* Council Tax 0
* Utilities 20-50 a month
* Fuel 1GBP a mile approx. If stationary fuel will be only used for keeping the engine healthy once a week, or for heating?
* Mot - 10 a month
* Road Tax ? Not sure, help me out, or i will assume 10 a month
* Insurance - Only if it is road running? I have hear you can get it for a bus for 50 a month, help?
* Total Running costs - 100-200 a month for all if stationary. More if running, at 1GBP a mile approx.

Compared to Apartment Renting and House Renting at 400-1k a month for a small family, this lifestyle seems ultra frugal? I aim to leave university and live with this lifestyle until I have saved enough for a house or suitable investments, as it is best to raise children 7+ in a solid house imo.

Wise or Retarded? Please help me decide!

edit: What would be the most frugal way of living? Frugal Housing Thread

edit2: My main concern is that house prices in the UK are absolutely absurd! For a decent family house it costs 150k, to build! In the north (where there aren't many jobs thanks to thatcher), I might be able to buy one for 100k with a 20k deposit. And with rent being a yearly division of this + profit, I don't see how renting can save money when comparing a mortgage (yearly division of cost + inflation + profit). I can only see myself living in the UK properly once the market settles down, or once I have a massive salary. So please advise me alternatives for low cost living so I can fund an investment egg of a few Deca-grands. The 10,000 straw bale house got ripped down thanks to planning officials.

Pond life/first episode gave 5 months. 2nd episode gave us 10 months. 3rd episode is unspecific, but Amy said he's been running around alone for too long, so it's probably been at least another few months on their side. Episode 4, from the previews, appears to span a year or so. 5th episode will probably follow suit and be at least a few months. All in all, we probably have at least 3 years, possibly more, since the Doctor dropped them off at their home.      

It was established early on that Rory preferred to settle down and have a family. And quite early on, we saw Amy repeatedly having to choose between the Doctor and Rory, ultimately always picking Rory. But say it wasn't established that Amy is infertile/inhospitable; then they would have been putting off having children for years. Unless Rory changed his mind, it would look like Rory wants to settle while Amy doesn't. That's a much bigger conflict than the one they actually had, and one that stems from Amy being selfish rather than selfless. (Though I think Amy's actions were wrong, her intention was that she wanted Rory's happiness more than her own.)   

Putting off kids would have suggested that Amy is constantly waiting for the next adventure with the Doctor, in favour over having a family with Rory. Writing in her infertility allowed for them to ""conveniently"" not have children, so they could travel with him despite the time gaps, while leaving the ""Doctor or Rory"" jealousy/misunderstandings in the past.",false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,null,null,default,"A few episodes later, now I think I know why Amy and Rory had ""the argument"" in Pond Life 5/ 7x01",2,http://www.reddit.com/r/doctorwho/comments/100xym/a_few_episodes_later_now_i_think_i_know_why_amy/

Heres what I believe. The Doctor becomes trapped in the Christmas special where he will meet Clara. From then, he spends the entire second half mourning the Ponds, having adventures with Clara, but most importantly, trying to escape being stuck in the four zones.

Yes, I believe he will be stuck in these four time zones for the rest of the second half. The four drastically different times gives them many options for things to happen, especially the future section. (Plus the sheer magnitude of the episodes in the first half must have drained their budget quite a bit!)

How does this tie back? It culminates with the 50th anniversary, with the Doctor finding out who/whats trapped him, and while being stuck in 4 time zones at once, don't you think theres a high chance he's going to meet a certain man? Yep, he will meet himself, and need the collective power of himself (My guess is x4, y'know? 4 time zones) To stop this foe and continue on to more adventures



I'm pretty sure thats the case at least. most people are only wondering the 50th anniversary and the Ponds exit. I like to think of the bigger picture :)

Oh, and I think the doctor will die on Trenzalore at the end of Series 8. While I wouldn't want that (cause Smith is my fav) I just keep getting that vibe for some reason.

As some of you will already know we're operating an Inhouse league for UK &amp; Ireland residents.

We were previously advertised on here but had to go back into hiding due to sheer number of players and lack of ability to cope.

Now we're back with a bang, currently running Inhouses from four in the Afternoon until well past midnight.

We're currently operating with 115 vouched players of all skill levels.

*Now it's time for more.*

So, this is an open invitation to everyone in the UK &amp; Ireland.
Join us on [IRC](http://www.ukdota.net/?page_id=14
), our [forums](http://www.ukdota.net), our 9001 slot mumble or even just our [steamgroup](http://steamcommunity.com/groups/KingdomofDota).

/Advert - *Our IRC / Mumble is also a great place to make friends.*

The Inhouse League is for solo players of any skill bracket, you sign in to a player pool and a Captain picks you, then you're on our mumble with 4 other English speaking players in a live fire game with our ELO system. 

**All skill levels are accepted.**

We're aiming for more than just this as we're more capable, with prize tournaments and goodie give aways in the eventual future.

First we need you, the community!

Hope to hear from you guys soon,

w'll - UKDota.net Admin team.

Of course, because River is in a lot of these episodes, I've had to explain the whole opposite timelines thing to her. The problems I'm having are:

- In Impossible Astronaut/Day of the Moon, River tells Rory that the first time the Doctor met her he knew everything about her and that's why she fell for him (which makes sense with opposing timelines, just how she knew everything about him in the library but he did not know who she was). But it seems to me that the time when he knew her and she did not was in Let's Kill Hitler. Which messes a bit with my brain because he DEFINITELY didn't know everything about her then. He didn't even know they were going to get married. Not to mention that in The Wedding, she still knew him (which she wouldn't if that was later in the Doctor's timeline than Let's Kill Hitler). 

- Why didn't she help in A Good Man Goes To War? She deliberately waited for everything to end before she arrived. What was the point? She knew what was going to happen. She knew Melody was going to be taken. Then why didn't she help? She could have solved it all by warning the Doctor. I know some will say ""spoilers"" but that could have helped him prevent his death - which is what she decided to do herself in The Wedding... She opted to destroy time as long as she could save the Doctor. Instead of all that, why not just tell him?

- And finally, if the wedding has now come, in future River appearances, River won't know they're going to be married, right? But that means that he'll tell her his name when they're not even married. Will he tell her his name the first time they meet? That would be lovely.

Players applying/inquiring must be somewhat skilled and must have a desire to get better, ask questions, accept criticism and advice, and have fun!

It doesn't matter what role you play, we're interested in everything you have to offer and will aim to suit our play styles together if we can.


If you can't play more than 4 nights/days a week for at least 5 hours at a time then it probably isn't advisable to waste your time applying :).

We began playing together only a week ago and recently competed in our first tournament, the DOTAFire Community Cup, making it to the quarter finals.

Heres a replay from the tournament: http://www.filedropper.com/game2


It's preferable that applicants are from Northern Ireland or Ireland, but mainland UK may apply also.

You can contact me by adding 'chackle' via steam or PMing me / replying to this post.

I use Netflix and have now gotten to the point where I've watched most of the shows that interest me in their entirety--Star Trek TNG, Star Trek DS9, Star Trek Voyager, Stargate Atlantis, Firefly, Battlestar Galactica, and so on. By this summer it had gotten near impossible to find anything I wanted to watch that I hadn't already seen. And every day that blue TARDIS kept popping up under ""Recommended for You."" I kept saying, ""NO NO NO NO NO.  Just because I like sci-fi doesn't mean I want to watch DOCTOR WHO."" But there it was--always there, always recommended. I frequently felt tempted to ""give it a try"" based on the endorsement of a former coworker of mine.  I only remembered ""Doctor Who"" as this weird sci-fi show I caught on occasion growing up in the 80's and 90's--it was weird, it had weird special effects, and the main character just looked...weird. I had to grudgingly admit I'd liked a little of what I'd seen of the show in those years--one of those things where something repels you, yet you somehow end up enjoying it. It's always weird when you find yourself liking something that initially repelled you more than things that you actually sought out and desperately wanted to see--and that's what happened with me and Doctor Who.

I cannot tell you how many times I chose not to watch this show even though every single day it was there in my face, that freaking blue phone box.  I knew it had to be somewhat good because so many people liked it. I don't remember why, but a month or two ago I finally decided to give it a try.

I initially just put it on while I was sewing. I ended up liking it more than I was happy to admit, but I was not head-over-heels initially. I liked Chris Eccleston and I found Billie Piper alright. I found it somewhat funny. The effects were appalling. Some of the story lines were so cheesy and some of them were truly unwatchable. But I kept watching. The show made me cry and then I got mad because I was crying over stupid stuff, I felt my emotions were being manipulated. I simultaneously hated and liked (not yet ""loved"") the show.  I remember seeing threads like ""Saddest Doctor Who moments"" here on Reddit and it really piqued my curiosity--I'd never heard of a ""sad"" sci fi show, and knowing this show actually had some depth is why I kept watching.

One thing I really did enjoy, even as early as Series 1, was that the story lines and the ideas were pretty fresh to me--somebody who has seen more American sci-fi than most normal people. I felt like, ""Wow! Finally something new!""--because even across fandoms (Star Trek to Star Wars to Stargate) you often seem to find the same basic ideas. I feel that DW introduces you to a number of different and new philosophies on life without forcing you to accept any one of them. It's a sci-fi show that shows no allegiance to any particular religion, yet treats almost all religions with respect--this is so refreshing to me. These days people act like you can't believe in science and still believe in religion. But in the crazy world of Doctor Who, no matter how nuts it is, no matter how bizarre the idea of time travel is and how much it might seem to nullify religious faith--the characters still seem to believe in God--even the aliens will say ""God save you""--how crazy is that?  Christmas is still celebrated, even if you don't hear nary a mention of Jesus--the point is that religion is treated with respect, not cynicism. In modern times, most non-believers seem to think that the answer to our problems is to *eliminate all religions.* This is a show that seems to show that the answer to many of our problems is to *respect all people, regardless of how different or even ludicrous their beliefs might seem*.  The show doesn't try to force the viewer to believe, and doesn't insult those who do--it seems to subscribe to a motto that I always try to apply to my own life and views--""Not better, not worse, just different.""  This is really remarkable to me. In American film and television, I feel that I can almost always detect the view of the writers, producers, directors, and actors of a show, and there is always some ""message"" they are trying to get across, something they are trying to convince me of.

By the end of Series 1 I really liked Chris Eccleston and was so reluctant to see him replaced.  At first I liked David Tennant but worried that his slightly over-the-top characterization would get grating. I think it wasn't until Series 4 that I finally said, ""I like this show. No--*I love this show*."" That's pretty crazy! Most shows you love the first or second season and then watch as it degrades in the following seasons. How odd, to *not really like a show* until 4 years into it, and then unabashedly love it. I wish I could remember what episode did it for me. Probably ""Silence in the Library."" I loved how Miss Evangelista's character was presented as so real and sympathetic--the scene where she was ""ghosting"" was a really unexpectedly heartbreaking scene. In American films it seems like beautiful women are always the stars, we're supposed to care about them, but they are never shown as having any depth, and often they are nothing more than ""vixens"" or eye candy. I love that Doctor Who doesn't divide women into ""pretty but shallow and annoying"" and ""unattractive yet intelligent and important"" categories.

So I did grow to LOVE David Tennant and once again dreaded a new Doctor. I liked Matt Smith instantly, though I think Tennant is still my fave doctor. I think series 4 is my favorite season, with 5 coming up next. Season 6 I really resented how it seemed to be turning into ""The Doctor Who and Amy"" show. The show has often been as much about his companions as about him, sometimes even more so. But I found the intro to season 6 awkward, it was like Doctor Who had become an ""Amy Pond and her friend the Raggedy Doctor"" spinoff. 

ANYWAY...I just wanted to take some time to sing the praises of this show. There are so many things about this show I love, as long as this is I haven't but scratched the surface. I really do think this is a *healthy* show--one that makes the viewer a better person for watching. How many shows can you say that about? Love, family, friendships, kindness, compassion, inspiration, encouragement--who would have ever thought a show about a time-travelling alien would above all be about *those things*?  I would love to hear how the rest of you got into this show.  :)",false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,null,null,self,Doctor Who changed my life - what's your story?,32,http://www.reddit.com/r/doctorwho/comments/101of2/doctor_who_changed_my_life_whats_your_story/

They argue that he played two great games against Inter and now he's overrated as a left winger.

Personally, I really like Bale; he's got speed and a decent touch on the left side of the pitch and he's scored some absolute crackers. On a lot of days where the cogs aren't turning for the rest of the team, he is trying his hardest to create some offense. I also believe that the mark of a great player is to really step up and play your best in the important matches, something Gareth has done for us in the champions league(club football's biggest stage). Last year there was some diving and theatrics and while it's still too early to call him great, I really think he's one of our top players, and one of the top wingers in the prem.

None of those things are true. DOCTOR WHO HAS NO CANON! 

Please take a moment to read this amazing essay by Doctor Who novelist and new series writer Paul Cornell. It really does explain the issue of canon in Doctor Who perfectly. I think a lot of newer fans try to apply the ""canon"" mentality of other franchises to Doctor Who, which was created in an entirely different fashion.

In the jailhouse scene, in the lead up to the revelation of Doctor Kahler, the Doctor goes off on a whiplash deduction scene. It begins when he exclaims, ""Two alien doctors!"" and laughs like it's a real gas. The camera cuts to Rory at the line and he does a small smirk and nod to the side. 

But this must be blaise to Rory. From his point of view, he and the doctor go tramping around the universe--a human doctor and a timelord doctor. Rory doesn't laugh because that's *his* life.

That all being said, my brain still conjures up notions that maybe, *maybe* there's a bigger plan here and it will make up for everything. Or I'm just reading into things too much...

ANYWAY... Asylum of the Daleks ended with all of the Daleks' memories being erased, followed by their repetitious asking of ""Doctor who?"" and then 11 bouncing around the TARDIS saying the same thing over and over. (A groan-worthy moment, if you ask me) My question/thought is this:

Has all of the ""Silence will/must fall when the question is asked"" stuff been resolved? Have we seen the last of them, or are they possibly setting up for the return of the Silence? The memory wipe is sort of a huge thing to do to an entire species, there has to be some importance to that beyond just resetting things between them and The Doctor. (Then again, the first time we see Moffat's Daleks, the multi-colored versions, it seemed like they were setting up for something bigger....and nothing ever really happened with that.

It is just such a great piece of the show for a character like the Face of Bao who is arguably the most wise character to hav arisen from Captain Jack, a completely vain and cocky character.

Given the huge difference in finances awarded and prestige, perhaps that is not surprising. 

However, if they were to award the winner of the Europe League a place in the next Champions League, surely it would make it a win much more meaningful and desired.

Do you guys think it would be a benefit overall or not really? What are some of the downsides to doing this? Would we then worry that teams put all their hopes on winning Europa and forgetting about their national league?

This ""prepper"" thing that's going on in the USA (there was a thing on telly a couple of months ago) - are you aware of this happening here in the UK too, or have we somehow managed to dodge it? 

I am told by my American pals, that there are MREs (Meal, Ready to Eat) and buckets of dried food available at various run of the mill supermarkets and sporting type stores over there. I know that a couple of the people I know in the USA have ""bug out bags"" which is basically a bag of stuff that will allow you to survive 48 hours or so, which should let you get clear of a major city in the event of a disaster.

What do you think about this idea, or way of life - both within the USA and here, if it applies to the UK?

Personally, I like to keep a few tins of soup, packets of pasta, rice, etc, in the cupboard ""in case of emergencies"" - but nothing more than my mother or grandmother would have kept about the doors back in the day.

Here is my conundrum, I'll be wanting to hire a car, the specific type of car I wish to hire is only available in the cities Manchester and London. So my plans were to drive from manchester to exeter and then to London.

I'd say although there have been three disappointing results (loss to Fulham, draws with QPR/West Ham), there are quite a few positives from our performances so far. Barring the Fulham game, we outplayed Spurs for long periods of that match and at the very least we stopped QPR/West Ham from attacking for lengthy periods too. 

My biggest concern is simply how well our other ""relegation contenders"" are doing... Swansea and West Ham have both started the season flying and of the four below us, it's hard to see Liverpool staying there, while QPR have a strong squad and just need time to gel.

Basically the friend I was meant to be living with this year has pulled out, his Dad's got him stuck in Edinburgh.

I've found a really, really nice place that's opposite the co-op on Brook Street, an easy 5 minute walk from Uni. It's a total of 600 a month between 2 people, with a minimum lease until October 2013.

Pictures can be found on this advert: http://uk.easyroommate.com/content/common/listingdetail.aspx?code=H12091854227481

I'm basically looking for someone who'd be up for moving into this place (I was originally planning to stay there till June 2014) or if anyone can offer me a place to stay. My details can be found on the ad.

Best way to get in touch is to email or call me, cheers!

He's checking whether his surroundings are real or not. We know The God Complex is a space ship and the hotel surroundings are a projection of sorts, so by eating the apple and not hating the taste he knows it isn't real.

This is backed up by more recent events, for example where The Doctor sticks his tongue out to taste the air in Dinosaurs on a Spaceship. I'm pretty sure there are other examples of him investigating via taste but I'm having trouble recalling them at the moment.

Simple and it fits.

After meeting a fair few of you at the meetup last weekend, I'm hoping to get a bunch of us together this Friday/Saturday to do something similar!

Last weekend we started off at the Beehive Inn, which I think worked pretty well. Its fairly central and there's a great beer garden outside. I propose we do that again, unless anyone has any better suggestions?

In terms of days...lets go for some democracy. I'm good for Friday or Saturday so I'll put this to a vote. Tell me when's good for and I'll tally it up and call it on Thursday evening.

Hope to see you all there! If you've never been to one of these before, come along! I guarantee it'll be fun!

**Kickoff: 7:45 GMT**

Location: Vicarage Road, Watford

Stream: Seagulls Player, BBC Radio Sussex audio commentary (only available in the UK)

**Starting lineups:**

Watford: (4-3-3) Almunia (GK), Cassetti, Nosworthy, Nueton, Pudil, Hogg, Abdi, Yeates, Forestieri, Iwelumo, Vydra.

Subs: Bond (GK), Beleck, Doyley, Forsyth, Smith, Hoban, Chalobah.


Brighton and Hove Albion: (4-3-3) Kuszczak (GK), Bruno, Greer, El-Abd,  Bridge, Bridcutt, Hammond, Dicker, Buckley, Orlandi, Mackail-Smith.

Subs: Ankergren (GK), Calderon, Dunk, Lopez, Harley, Barnes, Dobbie.

**sjk97's exclusive Match Preview (with stats from BBC Sport)**:

Brighton are coming off a 3-0 win at the Amex over Sheffield Wednesday that took us to third but Watford lost 2-1 away at Bolton at the weekend and are in 16th with 6 points from their first four matches. 

Last time these two sides met was at the Amex in April, a 2-2 draw; Calderon and Buckley scored in a comeback from 0-2 down at half time. The fixture at Vicarage Road last season ended in a 1-0 Watford win, and one of the most mind-numbingly dull Brighton performances of last season- we didn't make a single shot on goal!

The all-time series between the clubs is 42-30-32 in Brighton's favour. Brighton haven't beaten Watford in the last four meetings and haven't won at Vicarage Road in 20 years.

If Brighton win it will be four consecutive wins for the first time since March 2011. Watford have conceded first in  4 of their 5 games so far but they have also only conceded one goal at home.

He said we blamed Chelsea fans for the Heysel disaster.

Searched online and the only source I could find were Utd forums saying the chairman of Lfc at the time blamed Chelsea supporters infiltrating our away fans for the disaster.

Can anybody shed any light on this? Any truth? Was it ever rescinded?

Then as the series past and David Tennant took over I thought ok new doctor, took some time and thought he was a perfect replacement maybe not better but still kept the passion going for me. Then things started changing new sidekicks and new ""enemies"" some where good some where bad in my opinion. Then when the 10th Doctor left i was eager to know who was his replacement. Matt Smith. My first impressions was he looked too ""normal"" and wasn't very convincing as a time lord to me. Still I watched the first season to see if that would change. It did not.
(Here comes the part which will get the hate)
Matt Smith and the entire direction of the show seems to be too up-to-date or too modern. I realize its been some time since Christopher was the doctor which I fell in love with but Smith seems too cocky and a ""too nice guy"" and kinda missing the passion.

Then, he's away for a lot longer, the marriage falls apart, and the Doctor comes to fetch them for the Asylum, and Amy tells the Doctor it's been rough in the Doctor's long absence.

The Doctor pops in, takes what appears to him the be the usual, happily married Ponds to Manhattan, and sees them die/etc.  This makes him bitter, and he goes back in time to ep 2, where he almost fumbles Amy's quip about dying in front of him. Then onwards to ep3, where the Ponds want to go home for awhile.

I passed this idea across /r/gallifrey's desk and wanted to ask a larger audience and get a better consensus. Many of you have likely not seen the many Doctor Who adventures Big Finish has, would any of you be more interested if more of them were given visuals?

Just a testing of the waters, is anyone interested?",false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,null,null,self,Is anyone interested in an animated companion to Big Finish's audio plays? (X-Post /r/gallifrey),6,http://www.reddit.com/r/doctorwho/comments/103z8c/is_anyone_interested_in_an_animated_companion_to/

HUMAN...' as you know, Daleks are wont to do in their threatening way.  I paused and looked around and continued walking.  I was just hearing things right?  Nope, I hear it again.  I of course began to freak out (DALEKS ARE SERIOUS BUSINESS AFTER ALL) so I hurry to my car and climb in.

I figured it was someone playing a prank, it's not a secret that I've got a fondness for The Doctor as I have a little red Dalek hanging from my rearview mirror (the fun flashlight one from ThinkGeek).  I like to imagine bad drivers are getting exterminated by it.  Still, I didn’t see anyone, and it sounded really muffled so really, where were they hiding a speaker?  

I reached into my bag to pull out my GPS.  I don’t usually carry it, but I was on my way to an event and had programmed it before leaving the office with the address.  I left it turned on as the walk was short, the battery was fully charged and I wanted it to pick up the satellite signal as soon as I got outside to plan the route.  It wasn’t picking up from my office window.

I hooked it into its mount and started to back out and the sucker began speaking.  Turns out the last time I upgraded my maps, I also downloaded a Dalek voice for the GPS and set it.  It had been months since I’d used the GPS however and had completely forgotten.  Apparently the GPS had found the satellite signal from inside my bag and was trying to give me directions as I walked down the block from my office to the parking garage… in the voice of a Dalek.

Thought I’d share my Whovian moment from today with you all.  The best part is I’m leaving Friday for vacation.  Don’t plan on changing the voice before I leave… can’t wait til my dad (also a Whovian) gets in the car and hears it.   

TL;DR  -thought I heard a Dalek, was really just my GPS inside my purse trying to give me directions

Kick-off is at 19:45 BST / 14:45 EST / 11:45  PST.

Juventus are the reigning champions of Italian Serie A, winning the league title last season while going undefeated. They typically employ a 3-5-2 formation with Andrea Pirlo the centerpiece and maestro. We last played them in the 2008-09 Champions League first knockout round, defeating them 3-2 on aggregate, with Didier Drogba rediscovering his scoring touch and Michael Essien finding the back of the net on his return from an ACL injury. The 1-0 win in the first leg was Guus Hiddink's first match in charge.

In other Group E action, Shakhtar Donetsk will be at home to Nordsjælland.

**Team news**:

* John Terry and John Obi Mikel should both be fit after suffering knocks to the knee and back respectively.

I watched The End of Time last night.

The last several episodes have been *brutal*. I spent the entire day after watching Journey's End with a constricted throat and an achy heart, and I didn't think it could get any worse. But then there was the terrible ending to The Waters of Mars, and then...

I put off watching TEoT for a few days. I just wasn't ready to let go of David Tennant. I finally resigned myself, with the small consolation that the character would remain the same, as he did when he regenerated from the ninth Doctor (I loved Eccleston too). 

But then the Doctor told Wilfred that it felt like dying, and that ""some new man goes sauntering away...and I'm dead,"" and he was so scared and angry, and he didn't want to go, and the Ood sang him to sleep, and, and....

Did I just watch my Doctor die? For real?

Who's this new guy with the baby face and the wibbly wobbly (although clever how they worked that into Tennant's dialogue before he ever changed) vocabulary?

I guess I'm asking a question that's probably been debated among Whovians(?) for nearly fifty years: how much of The Doctor dies during a regeneration? I was convinced it was more like a change of outfits than an actual death, but the Tenth Doctor shook my faith. And I loved him, and if he's really gone I'm going to be even more devastated than I am right now...

He was ""the most wonderful man on Earth."" He's still in there somewhere, right?

2. What is the cheapest living for poor foreigner? Is it possible to get into some shared flat or something like that?

4. About administrative stuff. What do I have to do so I can have legal part-time job in England? Or what do I need for living and working in foreign country in general? (I am from EU btw.)

So here is some personal speculation with no evidence to back it. 

Rory's dad is an agent for a dark power ... Like the silence 

Someone will tame the Vashta Nerada and use them as a weapon

River Song will be the death of the ponds and not the weeping angels

The new companion will not be smart even though she is brilliant in the asylum of the daleks. 

The weeping angels will want something more than a power source, like a cement plant to make more angels. 

The doctor will be hit the head at some point with an object. 

Fish Fingers will be the last word out of Amy Ponds mouth. 

The Tardis exploding will be explained. 

The Master will return as a way for the silence to hunt the doctor. 

Some quirky alien with be on an episode that loves to dance like a uncoordinated white person. 

The silence will not be seen, but there presence will be felt. 

The doctor will be remembered by all his enemy's before the tie-in to the pandorica. 

The doctor will cross timelines with himself. 

The question hidden in plain sight is ""Who is the doctor?""

Now don't hate, just play along and throw out some wild speculation because in the end we are all going to be Moffucked anyway. 

He is such a great writer and has a knack for throwing me off track, given I don't pay too much attention anyway - rather I just enjoy the show.

And I was wondering: What would YOU choose?
Say you got offered a Time Lord's ability to regenerate. 12 times. You're still human, but whenever you get a deadly injury, deadly disease, or your body becomes too old, you'll become a lightshow and wake up again in a perfectly young, healthy body. Your gender and ethnicity will stay the same (i.e., it should be possible to claim you've had *really good* surgery for the paperwork, just for this thought experiment you can be sure you'll never be in trouble for identity fraud or anything). BUT, while you keep your memories, your likes/dislikes and personality will differ, as much as the Doctor's personality has been different. Would you do it? If you do it, would you be afraid of regenerating just as much as dying or would you be a bit more daredevil since you now got 12 lives to spare?   

Also, second scenario (edit to make it easier to understand): Everything is the same, but now there's the additional condition that you WILL have to undergo your first regeneration, your first ""death"" in the next 10 days.

In 2010 I created a Doctor Who background and uploaded it into my DeviantArt page. It was promptly stolen over and over again by others and claimed as their own, even though it was coprywrited. I had to put a watermark on it to keep from people stealing it.

However, I have seen a stolen version popup on this subreddit several times. Don't get me wrong, I LOVE this subreddit. DW is my favorite show of all time. 

I just want to say, please don't download the impostors version. He altered it just a bit to make it look original but it is a blatant knock off of mine. I worked hard on my original version, and I would gladly send a high res version of mine if people just asked.

They have the second have of season 6, and the first three episodes of season 7 in case you missed any.

This is not because of the Ponds or any of the characters of the show, I just believe the writing, while intriguing, has not taken into account The Doctor's character at all.

Sure, the homages to past iterations are there, but his character has become somewhat ridiculous and spontaneous. He is more likely to rely on feelings rather than his mind which makes him do stupid things.

For instance, the Doctor picking up a weapon and taking a man out to meet his doom in the last episode was anti-canonical, horribly executed and honestly the weakest story I have seen that wasn't a filler episode. 

This is not Sherlock, and the Doctor is not a psychopath. The Doctor uses his mind and observes all situations, runs through all scenarios and makes an informed decision instead jumping to a half witted conclusion that is based on mere speculation.

In the beginning of the 11th, his bumbling could be based on his regeneration, but he is done cooking. I want to see him be a genius again, not a little boy with a blinking toy that does nothing but make a funny noise.

Stephen Moffat, I thought you were a better writer than this. It makes me not want to watch anymore and that is a painful thought for me.

EDIT2: Has anyone else noticed that he has not mentioned Gallifrey, the Time War, His former family, or explain to his companions anything that is happening anymore? He just leaves them to fend for themselves and Amy just magically can use a space ship full of dinosaurs' computer interface automatically? Also that the telepathic translating device on the TARDIS is selective instead of being all encompassing as normal? I mean it's great that the doctor speaks horse and baby, but seriously is this what it has come to? Shouldn't everyone connected to the TARDIS be understood and also understand other lifeforms, unless most lifeforms' languages are from before time itself? Seriously is anyone else catching this?

EDIT: If you feel you should downvote me please tell me why, I would like to know. Even if that means you are telling me to blow it out my ass.

A couple of months ago I moved to outside Belfast on a two year working visa from Australia and aside from being a wee tad on the poor side, I've been loving it. I just want to find out more about the A levels.

I've moved from QLD, and all there is there is a day of exams covering maths, English and various random answers, but it's mostly multiple choice; it isn't a very hard exam but it is stressful. It's nothing like the A levels. Is there any way I can go for the A levels or do anything like it? Or does anyone know of what I could do? It's obviously important since 98% of jobs I've applied for have asked for what grades I have in them and I'd really like to get a job as soon as possible.

At the beginning of the episode the Ood are listed as costing 50 credits.
A few episodes prior in the Season 4 Christmas Special (The Voyage of the Damned), the Doctor tells Mr. Copper that his credit card has 1 million pounds on it, equivalent to 50,000,056 credits.  The exchange rate is therefore 1 pound to 50.00056 credits.  Further, the exchange rate between British pounds and American dollars is currently 1 pound to 1.6220 dollars.

So, if the exchange between pounds and credits in 2008 (the date of the Voyage of the Damned) has not changed by 4126 (the date of the Planet of the Ood), then each individual Ood only costs about 1 British pound or about $1.75.  Pretty cheap for some slave labor...

I am not a LFC supporter..I was born in Manchester and my entire family and I are life long United fans. I moved to the states a few years ago and feel in love with a fellow ex-pat, who has lived in the states since she was 5. Her family, born and bred in Liverpool. 

I have put her first in my life, we respect each others teams and we love each other more than anything I have ever experienced. Her life long dream has been to go back to the UK, and see Anfield and to see a match, preferably as close to her bday as possible. I am taking her to Anfield for the tour, and plan on proposing on the field, something that will take her breath away, this is my love for her, willing to do this. 

Problem, the closet game to her bday is away day at Villa. I have been looking online and I am willing to pay that much if I have to (up to 180 pounds!!)..but I was wondering if anyone could offer any help on how to get away tickets to this match. Oooorrr..If there someone could help me figure out the chances of LFC having a Home Europa League match, or FA Cup? 

We will be in the UK on March 27, and are leaving April 3rd...I am very stressed planning the trains, hotels, wedding rings,flights, and it would just really help me out if anyone could help me figure out dates of potential matches, or point me in the spot of the best odds to get a decent priced away ticket. 

Good luck this Weekend and thanks in advance for any help.

EDIT; Ok so the away game is off. Finance wise it just wasn't working, and she really wanted to see the entire stadium sing 'YNWA' and was actually bummed to be missing it. Now, we are going to the home game on April 6th I believe, but everything else tour wise is going on as planned. I will now be looking for a home ticket in the KOP, which shouldn't be half as hard. If for whatever reason they don'k take the tour on the pitch, then the tunnel or the locker room will have to do. 
Luckily she isn't a redditor or this post would be a damn give away. Thanks to those who have upvoted and commented. Good luck in the EL today, will be watching with my hopefully future wife.",false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,null,null,self,Proposing at Anfield/Ticket help..please!,15,http://www.reddit.com/r/LiverpoolFC/comments/105sb8/proposing_at_anfieldticket_helpplease/

I see Mikel get a lot of praise in this sub-reddit aswell as /r/soccer but i cant help but feel he is a liability and dangerous in the team. I feel this ever so more strongly especially after his last two performances, almost being at fault for a goal against QPR (if it wasn't for Cech) and was a major part of the second Juve goal tonight. I know a player cant be judged on two mistakes but that's not all I feel Mikel has been at fault for. I have found he loses the ball in his own half more than 4 or 5 times a game and puts other players under pressure because of loose passes etc. 

I cant help but wonder after seeing Essien last night getting so heavily involved in the game by creating chances for his team but also getting back to help at the back what were we doing letting him go.

I do try to keep up to date on current affairs but I'm totally lost on this one and have been for some time.

AFAIK marriage is what a church certifies and civil partnership is what the law certifies.  
So a man and a woman that have a traditional catholic wedding are married by a priest/God, and then sign a legal document saying that they are now in a civil partnership (and the priest just happens to be a person qualified to certify a civil partnership so he does it at the same time as a marriage).  
Compare that to two atheists getting married, they can just go to the registration office and get a civil partnership. They have the same thing (legally) as the catholic couple.  
Then if I made a church of Mr_Wolfgang_Beard and randomly selected two people from a crowd and loudly declared ""The God Mr_Wolfgang_Beard commands that you two are now married with his blessing!"", you could describe those people as ""Married under the eyes of God MWB"" but they would have no access to any legal recognition of their union without getting a civil partnership.

That system made sense to me and I thought I understood it, but now I'm pretty sure that is not how it works because apparently homosexuals aren't allowed to be married but hetrosexuals are and this is the government's fault? I thought being married was up to which ever church/ religion you belong to and had no influence on whether you are eligible for a civil partnership or not...

Anyway I'm sorry if this is obvious or stupid but I am genuinely confused and would be very grateful for some help.

In the youtube video I´ve posted you can see that they are sitting back to back, which leeds me to believe that Amy (and possibly Rory) get trapped in the past, and the only way to communicate is via the old ""Back to the Future"" way, which is sending letters so that the receiver gets them in the future. Where does the sitting back to back come in to it? Well, it fits quite well if we take into consideration that they might be filming half the screen in the past and the other half in the present, essentially two people in the same place but at different times, very heart breaking as in the end of ""His Dark Materials Trilogy"". It could also explain why the Doctor also has a set of the glasses, maybe Amy sends them along with the letter as a keepsake?

So, we know that the episode contains an army of Weeping Angels, River Song posing as the ganster Melody Malone, and is in Manhattan. I'm not 100% sure as to the authenticity of [this link](http://doctorwhotv.co.uk/series-7-filming-who-melody-malone-33095.htm), but it also says Rory is unsure how he got where he is. So my theory is this: In the present (perhaps a little in the future, Amy's wearing glasses to read), Rory is touched by an Angel and sent back in time. Amy and the Doctor go back to rescue him and find that River's there too (whether by her Time Vortex Manipulator or the touch of an Angel). For some reason, Rory is unable to travel forwards in time again and live in the present, so he and Amy elect to stay behind. In regards to someone dying this episode, maybe Rory dies in the present so they go back to save him? Or perhaps he's killed in the past, too.

REGARDLESS, we can even set a time for when this episode takes place in the past, thanks to [this picture](http://www.spoilertv.co.uk/images/doctor-who/Season%207/Episode%20Promotional%20Photos/Episode%207.05%20-%20The%20Angels%20Take%20Manhattan/2632075-doctor-who-series-7.jpg.php). The newspaper reads ""Detroit Lions Win Superbowl""; the last time they did that was 1957. If Rory was touched by an Angel, that would be about the right time to be sent back.

tl;dr Rory's killed by an Angel in the present, the Doctor and Amy go back in time to 1957 to save him and he and Amy stay in the past (or Rory dies and Amy stays behind).",false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,null,null,self,Theory about the Ponds' Departure [SPOILERS!],28,http://www.reddit.com/r/doctorwho/comments/106zco/theory_about_the_ponds_departure_spoilers/

sorry if there are lack of tags and such, not much of a hardcore Reddit submitter. tried my best. So to reiterate, the following contains spoilers, if you do not wish to know spoilers, stop reading, right now, seriously, right now.

**THE SECTION BELOW CONTAINS SPOILERS**

1:Amy is praying to Santa and thanking him for bringing her things. [spoiler](#s""If her parents do not exist until the big bang episode,"") then who brought her those things. Her aunt she mentions?

2:shadow, it could be prisoner zero, it could not. We do not know, I think It could very well be one of the silence, or the doctor on a return visit during the big bang. [pic](http://i.imgur.com/R7cLJ.jpg)

**THE SECTION BELOW CONTAINS SPOILERS**

3:Amy's house [having a third floor.](http://i.imgur.com/9ZDVH.jpg) This has been brought up a lot as we see a (#s""similar thing happen later on with [Crieg's flat.](http://i.imgur.com/718WG.png) Which we all know looks an awfuller lot like the [silence underground base.](http://imgur.com/718WG,6Px0K,CSSal,EI6Cq,SfGyF,MfC9l,9psfn,AHdMG,tY7Mj,XiszI,hnGbZ,R7cLJ,OjFWA,9ZDVH,L5n5q,RRO7Z#12) This could just be a use of the staging area again, or not, I do not know."")

4:Old lady who said she knew the doctor from somewhere. He rebutted the point comically, but then re-addressed it with suspicion. If you watch the Doctor carefully, you notice that he does some odd things, as he usually does when suspicious.
         4a:address the lady with suspicion [doctor appears to have intent this scene](http://i.imgur.com/L5n5q.jpg)
       4b:compare height of supposed son and mother [mothers height](http://i.imgur.com/6Px0K.jpg) comparing her to [sons height](http://i.imgur.com/RRO7Z.jpg) This is a classic doctor action in this scenario

5: The addressing of the phrase ""fairytale"" seems to come up a lot. Now to support this, the town ""Leadworth"" in question does not exist on this planet. Odd for Doctor who. It is stated several times throughout the current season that the pond's life is indeed ""like a fairytale"" Right down to Rory's chivalry and the Doctor's heroics.

6: Amy seems to know things about the town that do not make sense, I.E the duck pond, the doctor makes a point to point that she just knows what it is without questioning it. Could have a deeper metaphorical meaning or don't look qithought question, or it could be a hinting at the possibly nonexistent strange town.

7:the phone booth, now this one is odd, there is a [lady in the phone booth, with a cellphone](http://i.imgur.com/AHdMG.jpg), [at a separate angle to the other cell phones.](http://i.imgur.com/9psfn.jpg) Now, why would someone go into a phone booth with a cellphone, then point it generally in Rory's direction? could be dismissed as getting a pic of the strange occurrence in the atmosphere, however, why take it from inside a phone booth? just a little bit suspicious.

8:There is Rory's pin having a date from the 90's on it, but Moffet has dismissed it as a prop error. However, he has no contractual obligation to tell us the truth. Rule number one, EVERYBODY LIES

9: The laptop the doctor uses to hack into the call has was a brand called [""Myth""](http://i.imgur.com/MfC9l.jpg) another reinforcement of the fairytale theme.

**SECTION BELOW CONTAINS SPOILERS**

10: The old lady has a pin on that we see (river song wearing in the big bang,) as pointed out by [previous posts.](http://www.reddit.com/r/doctorwho/comments/y24td/river_songs_futurespoilers/#s)

11:[possible angel sighting](http://i.imgur.com/XiszI.jpg), if the angels can now have separate forms like the cherubs, then this could very well be an angel as well.

They could now be evolving into more forms for camo? happens in the global montage of clocks setting to zero.",false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,null,null,self,"[spoilers] series 5-7 spoilers, rewatching Eleventh hour",30,http://www.reddit.com/r/doctorwho/comments/1077oi/spoilers_series_57_spoilers_rewatching_eleventh/

The best I've come up with are:


You know, when I look back over the years, the worst story I could think of was (story about my brother dumping milk on the head of my sister)... but at least he's never stolen my shot at being prime minister.


Don't worry about, Mr. Miliband, once Cameron is done privatizing the country and kicking all the students out of university, there won't be much of a country left to lead. Maybe ed got the pointy end of that stick,anyway.


Help, what are jokes that Labour people would laugh at?

ADDITIONAL guarantee: TOP VOTED JOKE WILL BE TOLD, AT LEAST IN PRIVATE TO BLAIR AND MILIBAND.

Edit: I originally wrote a 5 minute speech that was 100% about the bride and groom.

The votes are in from the other thread and it looks like **Saturday** has won by a landslide. So therefore, we'll be converging at 8pm at the [Beehive Inn in Grassmarket](https://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=beehive+inn+edinburgh&amp;amp;amp;amp;aq=f&amp;amp;amp;amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;amp;amp;amp;hl=en) for conversation, drinking, and inevitably, shenanigans. It looks like its going to be fairly dry, so we'll probably be hanging out in the beer garden out back.

A fair few of you I've met before or have met some of the regulars, but for the benefit of those who haven't, I'll be serving as a human waypoint. I've got thick black glasses and will be sporting [this](http://www.threadless.com/product/420/Alphabet_Zoo) tshirt on the night, which is hopefully bright and distinctive enough that you'll recognise me!

**EDIT:** *Flamekebab* has kindly offered us his awesome pirate flag for the evening which we will be using as a marker! This is obviously dependant on *gloomypancake* showing up on time (her words, not mine!) so if you can't find a pirate flag, fall back to the blue animal tshirt linked above.

We'll likely be staying at the Beehive for an hour or two before heading off, so if anyone wants to come but thinks they might be too late to catch us before we head off, PM me and I'll give you my mobile number so you can enquire as to where we are. Same goes for those who haven't met anyone and thinks they might struggle to find us, PM your number and I'll give you directions!

**ElevenReds MOTM:** - Jonjo Shelvey

Potential future Captain. Came on lead the midfield, keep the team moving forward, controlled the pace, doesnt panic, stays calm, strong.

Class, absolutely class player 

**BONUS FACT:** Did you know Jonjo Shelvey studies one on one under Steven Gerrard? 

---------------------------------------

**Special Mentions**

**Brad Jones** - Despite the 3 goals in he made some brilliant saves, he also made some big mistakes, score line doesnt reflect his performance.

**Jamie Carragher** - Good from what we can expect from him these days,  responsible for one of the YB goals, possible involvement in another, but was a road block at times.

**Jordan Henderson** - Had great moments and frustrating moments, if he can keep the ball better under pressure he could be a great player **SPECIAL SHOUT OUT TO HENDO FROM JONJO - Gotta give a big thanks to Hendo for two great assists 😃 ledge!!!**

**Coates** - Will be in the first team in a few years, great player in the air, not the best when stopping a counter attack

**Suso** - I can see why people are eager to see him to play, if he learns to use that right foot of his he could be an INCREDIBLE player..almost scored a Messi esqe goal 

**Assaidi** - Dayum..that boy can feed, he can also shoot, chase, attack..need to see more of him but a good game

**Sahin** - Same with Henderson, had moments that showed how brilliant he can be but was let down by the rest of the team at times

**Wisdom** - That boy can fly..

**Shelvey** - Jonjo fucking Shelvey

**Borini** - Honestly, Honestly, he looked good when he came on, he cut through, took and gave well, came close to scoring, he's clearly getting better

Fast forward to a week ago. I'm surfing through Netflix when I see Doctor Who on there. I figure I might as well give it another chance, what's the harm. I was looking for something to waste my time with.

I am now mid way through season 3 and can't stop. Holy hell I can't get enough Doctor Who. Now when I see a Dalek, I pee a little and return to my American roots with classics such as, ""Oh shit, bitches 'bout to go down,"" or ""fuck that Dalek bitch up Doctor, show them your pimp hand."" And now I have a little problem.

I just found the movies and I've been told by my mom that they fit into the story line at certain points. Does anyone know when I should watch what movie, or have I come too far in my Who-a-thon and might as well forge ahead?

We brought in so many new players this summer that it will obviously take some time before we really get clicking. 

It's now just over a month into the season and I have a few observations that I would like to open up for discussion. Yesterday's game was particularly enlightening as well given it was the first real chance to see Oscar and our first chance to see us play against a higher caliber of opposition in a game that mattered. So here goes...

1 - RDM likes to play with at least 1 two-way winger, such as Ramires and Bertrand, to bring some balance to team. I think this is pretty obvious to everyone. I find that this approach works when we are playing against a really dangerous winger such as Ribery or Robben for example. However, we have now seen a few times where it didn't really seem to give us the right balance. In the Juve game for example, I thought Ramires did a really good job of supporting the midfield and breaking up play and winning the ball. At the same time we were rather weak on our right wing, thus allowing Juve's LCB to stay in position and double up coverage on Torres. Would we have been better off just playing Ramires in CM to begin with?

2 - I have been really impressed by the tenacity of Hazard and Oscar. Hazard for one has a great work rate and I've noticed him track back well a few times. Oscar, while small, seems quite capable of marking a player 1 on 1 and his pressing high up the pitch is surprisingly good.

**So the question I will pose to you guys is this: Are we really that weak defensively if we play the trio of Hazard, Mata, and Oscar together?** Is there another way for our team to find balance without having to resort to a defensive winger? Or do we just keep what were doing and hope our team will naturally improve with the current setup?",false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,null,null,self,[Discussion]: Finding the right balance,8,http://www.reddit.com/r/chelseafc/comments/107t7g/discussion_finding_the_right_balance/

I'm sure most of you have seen that Mikel was very recently the subject of racial abuse on Twitter after the conclusion of last night's game. No person ever deserves racial abuse, in any circumstances, but I don't think Mikel should even be the victim of any sort of abuse. Criticize him if you want (his game isn't perfect and there definitely are areas of his game worthy of criticism), but no player that's been such a phenomenal servant to the club should be abused, let alone by our own fans. A few points in defense of this position:

* Trolled Manchester United into thinking he signed for them, before showing his True Blue colours
* Has steadily improved with each passing season
* Changed positions without complaint (defensive positions are incredibly difficult for young or inexperienced players, Mikel is/was both as he moved to a strictly defensive position while normally playing as an attacking midfielder)
* Rarely, if ever, complains or speaks negatively to the press
* One of Chelsea's top performers in the 2012 Champions League Final, and the second half of the 2011-2012 season in general
* **Did not miss a game for Chelsea despite his dad being kidnapped**

Personal opinions on him, such as whether you like him or not, believe he should start or not, is irrelevant to such a point; someone who's dedicated so much to the club should not be treated in such a manner. I think it'd be a nice show of solidarity if we were to agree on a hashtag or something that we could use in a tweet to the official Chelsea Twitter account ([@chelseafc](https://twitter.com/chelseafc)) to show our support to one of our long-serving team members. A rant like this has been on my mind most of the day but the Twitter thing is relatively new, so I have no idea what sort of hashtag we should decide on. #LoveForMikel or something? We're 3000+ strong and if enough of us do this, maybe it'll get noticed by the club.",false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,null,null,self,[Idea] Show of support/appreciation for Mikel?,63,http://www.reddit.com/r/chelseafc/comments/107ysv/idea_show_of_supportappreciation_for_mikel/

When the Doctor leaves Rory and Amy on the transporter he gives Rory the control unit and tells him to transport out if things get to 'explody whoady'. This line felt incredibly cheap and out of (Smith's) character for him to say.  To me it's like Moffat thought 'The interwebs really like that 'Timey wimey' line lets see if we can wedge in another variation'.  I don't think there is anything inherently wrong with the writers pandering to their fan base, it's great, but I kind of feel like those lines are reserved for 10s incarnation much like I feel that if any other doctor pulls the 'I wear a &lt;something&gt;, &lt;something&gt; is/are cool now'  it would just be cheap pandering and wouldn't carry the same weight then if Smith had said it.

*End Of Time*

* Who was the lady that kept showing up to Wilf, the one that the leader of the Time Lords stated ""was shamed in the position of the angels of old""

* what did the master's ring say in galifreyan (just learned that it was more than just circles)

*11th Hour*

* Why did this crack open and show the atraxi eye?

* Is prisoner zero relevant? He seemed to know about the silence and what caused the crack

*Other Episodes*

* Why did the Tardis explode? We see the crack on the monitor twice (once in the 11th hour, then again in a future episode) and we know the silence can get on board the Tardis

* How did Melody get from Florida to Manhattan? Did she regenerate to a black girl after seeing the black homeless guy? How then, did she get to England to grow up with Rori &amp; Amy? I think S07E05 will answer all of these because Angels are in Manhattan. *hint hint*

* Will the Doctor revisit River saved in the library? He still needs to give her his sonic and send her off, which I think will be saved for the near end of this season when 'the question is asked'

**Theories**

* 'lost time' seems to be a very prominent arc with the ponds from the very beginning with the doctor, then rori's 2000 years and Amy's waiting in that hospital.

* Angels play a key role for Moffat and we know Angels play a key role in the pond's last episode. I don't think they die, I think Amy is sent back in time by an angel and is the aunt we meet at the 11th hour that took care of amelia once her parents vanished",false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,null,null,default,"Questions unanswered, possible spoilers.",18,http://www.reddit.com/r/doctorwho/comments/109592/questions_unanswered_possible_spoilers/

Help: I started out by gathering all the names of the companions so I could try to plot them out but there are *so* many! I know sometimes the Doctor picks up a companion only for a few episodes but enough that they constitute as ""multi-episode"" companions, like Adam Mitchell. I don't want to include those companions, just the major ones like Sarah Jane, Rose, Grace, Martha, etc... The problem is I haven't seen enough of the classic Who to be able to pick which ones were main companions and which weren't. That is where you lovely people come in!

Kick-off is at 15:00 BST / 10:00 EST / 7:00 PST. **For your localized start time, [please see here](http://www.premierleague.com/en-gb/matchday/matches/2012-2013/epl.match-preview.html/chelsea-vs-stoke)**.

Stoke are a physical, tough team to play against. They currently sit in 12 place in the Premier League, winless after four games with four consecutive draws. We last played Stoke at home last season, with Drogba scoring the only goal in the 68th minute. It was his 100th league goal.

----
**Team news**:

* Daniel Sturridge will certainly miss out with a hamstring injury.
* Marko Marin remains injured, another one suffering a hamstring problem.
* Oscar has a knock on his ankle, suffered during a mix up with Juventus defender Leondaro Bonucci. Conflicting reports about whether he is available or not, but at this point I'm hearing he should be available.

For Stoke, forward Mamady Sidibe is out with an injured hamstring, midfielder Jaime Ness is doubtful and central defender Andy Wilkinson serves the first of a three game suspension.

First of all sorry because I know you had this thread many times before. Did some searching around and got some ideas, but still wanted to try this :)
I'm starting a new work in Edinburgh in december, next to Picardy Place and I need to start looking for an apartment.

I'm not gonna have a car, and I'd like to go to walk to work if possible (25 min walk max, something like that) rather than taking the bus. I was looking for an area where I can walk anywhere: coffee shops, restaurants,  bakeries, supermarkets etc.

Job is well payed, so budget shouldnt be a big issue (probably up to 1200 per month)

Thanks everyone, any help will be appreciate. I'm very excited to come and experience the city!

So, i decided to give it a try.
The weepings angels have not been put into too much details with their teleportation ability, only that they send their victims into the past, but what is its range? The silence have also been ignored for a few episodes now, and i believe they are the cause of the lights, as it has been shown they can manipulate electricity to their advantage. Now, what do these two have in common?
Now, with the return of the weeping angels and The Question still lingering, I think that the end of the first part of the season could lead to not only Amy and Rory, but also the Silence. I believe that the angels and The Silence will work together against the Doctor, and an angel could easily send him anywhere in space and time, but I think he will be sent to the Fields of Trenzalore with Amy and Rory, who both are either near death or soon going to be seperated from the doctor forever.

One of the commentators today said something that really struck a cord with me, and it's that we're passive, lacking a bite. We have all the necessary elements, great fluid passing, darting runs, but we lack that sure strike. If we had someone in front of goal (i.e Falcao, Cavani, etc.) that was a serious force and made defenders tremble when they get the ball, we would be the complete team.

I personally think Borini is our guy.

 Suarez prefers playing on the right and when he does is phenomenal. I think Suarez would be more beneficial to the team in a supporting/attacking role. He does and can score, his scoring can even be spectacular, but he wastes a LOT of chances but at the same time he creates a lot.

Borini has gotten some grief for failing to convert but I hear he's doing extra training sessions and from what I saw against Young Boys as soon as he came on he looked, stronger, smarter, more dangerous than I have seen him before. Only 21 but he looked and played like a senior player as soon as he came on.

I think that we are going to get a 12th Doctor at the end of this season.

First:    
The doctor is going crazy. Acting out of character (Town Called Mercy, saying he needs to honor the victims first, and then gets sidetracked and talks about himself, rather than Kahler-Jex) Him aging so much, (he's up to 1200 now, or something) and having lots of off-camera adventures, and many more examples.

Second:    
This is Smith's 3rd season, and also the 50th. We know Baker is coming back, Eccleston said ""I'm not done with this character"" and other things that just seem to be too good to pass up a chance for...

Third:    
We haven't seen ""the moment"" yet. We don't know what killed the time lords, besides the fact that the Doctor did it.

I think that 11 will regenerate, we will get to see 8-9 regeneration as well, and see what all it is that makes the Doctor tick. Daleks and Time Lords and Doctors, Oh my.

Following some suggestions made earlier this week both in mod mail and [in a thread]( http://www.reddit.com/r/doctorwho/comments/zr45d/something_to_be_considered/), we've made some additions to hopefully help users filter and search for content. These additions are the multiple submit buttons (suggested by /u/Skyblacker, originally from /r/atheism(?)). Also we’ve added Discussion Mode and Normal Mode functions.


Discussion Mode is just that, only discussion. It's not 100% perfect since not all self-post are necessarily discussion threads but its there nonetheless. 


The new submit button ""Submit Memes and Whumour"" directs users to submit on /r/DoctorWhumour. These hopefully will emphasis the use of subcategory subreddits for other types of content and encourage users to post more HQ/original content here. What constitutes HQ/original content is anything in the “Stuff we like” sidebar section.


Reminder to new and returning users to please check the [FAQ Policies]( http://www.reddit.com/r/DoctorWho/faq#rDoctorWhoPolicies), sidebar and [meme-free zone]( http://www.reddit.com/r/doctorwho/comments/yljy0/mod_rdoctorwho_goes_memefree/) before submitting a post. Check on them again from time to time to see if there's anything new!


Thank you. We value your feedback!

1. Are there any episodes I should see before continuing? I saw the Plane of the Dead, The Waters of Mars, and I am currently watching the Next Doctor (2008 Christmas Special). I didn't see the episode where Tennant's hand was cut off, but I get the gist of the episode and the entire influence it has on the series. 

2. Is there anything I should know about the upcoming seasons for me? Are there any episodes that backtrack to previous doctors or seasons that are a must know?

3. Is it necessary to see the other shows related to Doctor Who, like Torchwood? (the name of the type of show escapes me right now) I just want to fully experience the show and ever reference, so would these help at all, or are they just shows for the sake of entertainment? Do they matter?

4. Anything else I don't know I should ask about? Let me know!

As for my experience so far, I feel like this show is awesome. I couldn't sleep for days after seeing the episode with the weeping angels. My god, that haunted me. The Daleks are really cool and every episode they are in seem to be exciting. I loved Chris Eccelston (I have been told that this is unconventional) and I loved Martha Jones as a companion. Donna was really annoying and Rose was pretty useless all the way through, but Martha actually got shit done, and fast. David Tennant was a very good doctor because of his enthusiasm, but I just thought that his serious moments were lacking. Eccelston was quite the opposite, but that is just nitpicky of me. Every moment of every season finale was pretty powerful to me, and I am just sucked into the show. I started the show a week ago, though I have seen some episodes prior to starting because my friend showed it in the anime club a few times. On another note, the entire show is very well written and everything was planned out WONDERFULLY! The Face of Boe was GENIUS! BRAVO! MOLTO BENE!

This show is clever and genius. ",false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,null,null,self,"I just finished season 4 of Doctor Who, the one where Tennant bids adieu...",1,http://www.reddit.com/r/doctorwho/comments/10bjgw/i_just_finished_season_4_of_doctor_who_the_one/

Something occured to me in this episode... if the season was backwards then this would have been the first time that rory's dad would meet the doctor and it did not seem this way.... unless....

Ep2 and Ep3 occur during this episode! when rory's dad asks the doctor how long they went away (when he notices they are wearing different clothes) the doctor says, i think, 6 weeks. during those 6 weeks we see them visit henry the 8th(or 7th, or whatever it was) but earlier in this season we heard the doctor chastising rory for leaving his phone charger there, before we saw them go there.

Additionally, something else rory's dad said might be the clue. he stated that they are wearing different clothes. i dont have the time or the ability currently at work to verify this but the clothes they are wearing before they leave for those 6 weeks and the clothes they are wearing after those 6 weeks... arent they they same as the clothes they wore in episode 2 and 3?

this also completely destroys my theory that everything we've seen happens after the ponds leave but still makes it have the season be out of sync.

additionally, and i hate to admit this to add fuel to the ""rory is the master"" fire.... is that a fob watch? on the dresser? when amy is looking at the cube? i hope so cus that would be an excellent troll by the set designer.

I know that's probably a bit of a leap for most people, but think of it this way...

 - Amy and Rory, in their impending departure, are maturing a great deal of development in a push towards accepting their departure--much like the Tennant Specials did for the Tenth Doctor.

 - The episodes are far more self-contained and, well, episodic than those of Series 5 or 6 (reminiscent of the changes in tone between the Tennant Specials).

 - Amy and Rory, or just Rory if you don't like Amy, are beloved Companions, and are getting a sendoff that has been awaited for a while and much-anticipated.  The publicity surrounding their departure emphasizes that it will be *heartbreaking*.  Who else's departure was preceded by four major appearances since the preceding season's end?  *David Tennant/Tenth Doctor*.

Watching the Eleventh Doctor I started to notice that his bow ties and Braces (suspenders) would match whether he was in the present/future(red) or past(blue) which is something I assume has been covered long ago and isn't particularly new. 
What is really standing out in this theory that the past two episodes A Town Called Mercy and the Power of Three his bow ties and braces have been mismatched (at parts) with blue bow tie red braces. I haven't had time to go back and check other episodes. But I do know by now, not much is by mistake when it comes to costuming and if they have been on top of the color matching the time up to this point it must be on purpose. 

This mixed with the large gaps in time between when The Doctor visits The Ponds and the tracking of his age which at one point he admits to being 1200 (if I remember correctly) it seems to me like he is jumping back in time over certain parts to visit the ponds and re-live or have new adventures with The Ponds leading up to what we all know is to come, causing the clash in present and past, red and blue. And this can be paired with the This season seems like its being shown out of order from a story standpoint theory (I'm sorry I couldn't find the link to it). I guess we shall see where its really going to go, but for now to me it seems like The Doctor is grieving the loss of the Ponds and coming to terms by going back and having more adventures with them. Until we know, it will always be Wibbly-wobbly fun.

Also, at one point in Power of Three the Doctor goes back to matching braces and bow tie (red) for the rest of the episode. 

TL:DR The Doctor's normally matching Bow Tie and Braces of red or blue have recently been mismatched into red and blue.

  Some squatters (or maybe people abusing the squatting law) have decided to claim the local abandoned music studios and turn it into their own personal night-club, and were blasting out music last night from 2am (and it's still going).  I've popped over and they've stuck the s144 LASPO 2012 exemption notice up and basically told me ""it's non-residential and we're not living here, so there's nothing much you can do about it"".

I've done some research and it seems that section 144 only deals with squatters in residential areas, and currently there are no provisions with dealing with non-residential buildings?  Is there anything I can do short of contacting the building owners and get them to start legal proceedings and fix their security?

EDIT: As [Kushkan](http://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/10c1ee/nonresidential_squatters_causing_a_nuisance/c6c65l9) pointed out, I highly suspect that the property owners are involved.  This is because the only visible entrance to the property is through a large iron gate which is padlocked and secured by a heavy chain.  When I returned home earlier yesterday, this gate was *unlocked and open* and people were coming and going.  When I went to investigate the noise issue later last night, this was now *chained and locked*.

I find it interesting that undertaking a vehicle should be compared to speeding. It's not a bad comparison actually:

* most of the times you undertake on a cycle you'll live, most of the times you speed in a car you'll live
* when things go wrong undertaking on a cycle you could die, when things go wrong speeding in a car you could die

As an aside I don't speed. Yes I know that is unheard of in the UK. But I don't do it.

But listening to a cyclist arrogantly suggest undertaking isn't dangerous is like listening to a teenager arrogantly suggest walking on the edge of a cliff isn't dangerous.

I appreciate more input.

As regular readers of this subreddit know, all 4 episodes have mentioned (or in the case of ep. 4 straight up contained) Christmas. 
If I am not mistaken, Moffat has stated that someone is gonna die next episode and it's gonna be sad. We also know that Amy and Rory are departing as companions that episode, with the likely conclusion that it's one or both of them dying.
We also know that in the Christmas episode, Jenna-Louise Coleman is going to take over as the next companion. She played Oswin Oswald in ep. 1, who died at the end of the episode as far as we know. 

First, I expect Jenna is going to star as Oswin again. I see absolutely no reason why she should star in an episode right before she becomes the next companion as a completely unrelated character. Yes, Karen Gillan played in the Fires of Pompeii, but that was a minor role and no one had an idea she'd become a companion later. Jenna was already cast at that point. 
A prerequisite for that is an explanation on how she isn't dead right now. Oswin somehow managed to not die, escape Death or come back somehow. Simply placing the episode earlier in her time stream causes wibbly-wobbly problems about the Asylum episode, especially about the Daleks forgetting the Doctor. Anyway, I feel it is possible that for a truly Christmassy twist, Oswin manages to save Amy and Rory the same way, thus gifting the Doctor the only thing that can reasonably be on his Christmas list after he could not save Amy and Rory himself.

So yeah, that's what I got. Now please disprove this or help me fill in the blanks.

I have watched every single episode out there, read many of the DW books and listened to some audiobooks. The 2005 season started off pretty cheesy, but by the time the 10th Doctor was introduced, i feel as if new Who has gotten extremely mature, on par with most of the old series. It became much more a narrative about life, death, and the intricacies of how the universe works when you're experiencing psychological euphoria, travelling everywhere in space and time with a crazy man who borrowed a blue box from his own kin.

When Stephen Moffat was put in charge this all got phased out for children's topics and ""frightening"" (see: childishly simple) scenarios. Season six entered a whole new level of silliness, defying the whole story of the show, full of cheap tricks and cop-outs that would put any hardcore fan out the door for nonsensical plots and ridiculous cliffhangers.  

---

Season seven, i feel, is the biggest joke of a serial i have ever seen. Dinosaurs on a Spaceship is a wreck of an episode. Therein not just defying the Eleventh Doctor's character by making him kill the villain in cold blood; there was no depiction of the ""horrible crimes"" the villain had committed. If you kill this guy for genocide, why not just kill all the daleks when you had the chance to do so, earlier? 

---

A Town Called Mercy was not a concrete story. There was no clear idea about what the plot really was, only whimsical hints thrown out towards the end of the episode. Also, why make Amy stand up for someone who almost killed her, when she murdered Kovarian in the previous season?

---

**The Power of Three was just absurd.** It was, in my opinion, the worst episode since Love and Monsters. The episode had no story, no goal for the villain or the Doctor to achieve - it was just something to give a honorable mention to services like Twitter, Flickr, Apple - two alien races and the Brig.

I was on here about a month ago looking to get into the Dota 2 scene and have to say that since then I have met a bunch of kind, patient and helpful people who have been supportive in guiding me through the basics of the game and offering hints and tips at all times. Danny D, Veyf,  Will, Amaninside and Kinth (who pointed me in the right direction); I thank you all! 

All these players have advised me that the best way to actually now begin to play the game is through collaborating with other players who are extremely new to the game (I have had absolutely no experience of any gaming like this before) who might want to meet up on a Friday or Saturday night to begin simply competing against Bots. I still don’t feel ready to go out into the brave new world and combat against other players, even if matches are evenly placed. 

I would happily take any suggestions on board: I am a relaxed player who is just enjoying this excellent game. I like to research, read and watch videos on the game and am committed in that way but cannot commit to a heavy play-load until school holidays kick in (I teach). 
Look forward to nearing from fellow Noobs. Feel free to Friend and contact me through Steam or Reddit.

(*This thread is still being updated*)

--------------------------------------------

Yes I know its important to be optimistic and we put in a hell of a performance but that game was stolen from us...

Never a straight red although Shelvey was hot headed all game and that REALLY was never a penalty

**BUT** the hard games are out of the way, we looked incredible until Jonjo got sent off and hopefully we'll continue this run in the future. 

Sahin will almost likely replace Jonjo who will be in Rodgers bad books.

**Also** I know some of you dont like this *'the ref is to blame'* talk, but the ref's 2 **bad** decisions directly gave United 1 goal and put us at a crippling disadvantage  

--------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------

**EXCLUSIVE**

[You control the ref and the game - Shelvey to SAF](https://twitter.com/Ezizallamov/status/249887605922078720)

----------------------------------------
-----------------------------------------

**Positiveness:** 

* **BR's SYSTEM WORKS**, slowly but surely we are getting our shit together

* Our kids are not just good, they are **INFUCKINGCREDIBLE**

* We just took United for a run for 90 mins with 10 men, 2 of which are u19...we are *this* close to becoming unstoppable 

**Negatives:**

* While Jonjo may be the future Gerrard he has a lot to learn, he needs to settle his temper and he needs to think like a leader

* Borini still cant score, not easy against United ill say but the amount of opportunities he gave up or missed..

* Somebody tell me what the fuck is happening to our defence? At times we were letting them run right through

* Injuries...please, please dont be serious 

--------------------------------------------

**ELEVEN REDS MOTM:** Steven Gerrard 

Inspirational stuff from the captain, scored and gave us hope, had to cover two positions and did so well. 

**ELEVEN REDS CHUMP:** Jonjo Shelvey 

From the get go was argumentative, aggressive, throwing himself about, *may* be responsible for the turn in fortune for us, we had complete control of the game until he got sent off, maybe not a straight red but he didnt help by charging at the ref. THEN argued with Rio, then SAF, the police officer, BR and will likely lose his first team place to Sahin. 

-----------------------------------------------

**Quick Player Reviews**

* **Suso &amp; Sterling** both deserve much praise! 17 and 18 year olds leading the attack against man utd..its unheard of and almost unbelievable, but Sterling was a terror with his pace and crossing and Suso cut through the defence again and again. Expect these 2 to become first team players.

* **Borini**... I wanted him to play well but he gave it away again and again and again

* **Suarez** looked dangerous but couldnt convert, maybe a little hard done by this ref but didnt help when he dived in the box, came close a few times

* **Kelly** surprisingly looked good, may remain a first team player..could be injured

* **Allen** Didnt keep his perfect passing record as well as he has in other games but was instrumental in getting that ball into deep united territory. 

* **Johnson** I dont know what they are feeding him but he is getting better and better, unfortunate to be blamed for that shocking penalty call but helped push the team forward",false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,null,null,self,"Post Match Thread ",42,http://www.reddit.com/r/LiverpoolFC/comments/10cblt/post_match_thread/

Reading the advanced review, it seems that Amy simply chooses her married life with Rory instead of life with The Doctor. It also goes to say the episode is the perfect send off for the Ponds. Rory is the one who gets sent back. To 1938. It's not a fixed point or anything as The Doctor and Amy go looking for him. I'm guessing that's where she lives with Rory. The Doctor then says his final farewell to the Ponds. It all makes sense as well. I mean, if the angels are in there ""transport people back mode"" and not there ""neck snapping mode"" why should one of the Ponds die? The picture that was released of The Doctor hugging Amy and Rory seems to probably be the farewell to them. All in all, I'm pretty confident they end up together in the end and they don't die. That is why I'm sharing this as I'm sure I'm not the only one not wanting them to die.

We didn't deliver the result, but QPR were a joy to watch. Lots to work on next week, but lots to be positive about too.

Some of the positives- Granero had a fantastic first half, both disrupting the opposition and in possession. He looks so composed, and his corners were excellent. It's been a long time since we've seen decent corners. Ryan Nelson gets better and better and led the makeshift defence well.

A few weeks ago I finally started watching this fantastic show, starting with the 2005 reboot.  Of course, I love it, so I've been racing through it.

And I just watched The End of Time a couple days ago.  And I am so, so, baffled by the end of it.  On the one hand, I love it and it makes me cry because it's the end of 10, and at first I thought it was going to be well done.  10's ""I could do so much more"" speech made me tear up; my heart really went out to him because *of course* he would die to save Wilf, even if he thinks he's more important.  We see him go through the thought process of his ego, but in the end he knows he can't let Wilf die.  That was beautiful.  And so he steps into the booth and you see him crumple to the floor, and I'm on the verge of crying because I think this is it, 10 is regenerating right now, this is the end.

But instead he gets about 20 more minutes of screen time to say goodbye to all his friends.  The regeneration process has started, why does he have more time now than 9 had before full regeneration?

And my oh my, those goodbye scenes are a weird 20 minutes.  First we see Martha and Mickey together, trying to fight off a Sontaran.  At this point we learn that Martha and Mickey are married; who saw *that* one coming?  Do we assume that this happened a few years into the future?  And why are they fighting a Sontaran anyway?  What is going on?  Things only get worse in the scene with Captain Jack in the bar with a whole lot of aliens that 10 has encountered.  Why is Alonso there?  Where are they anyway?  What is going on??

Don't get me wrong, I was happy to see 10 get his farewells with all the people important to him, and some of the farewell scenes were beautiful - particularly when he goes to see Nurse Redfern's granddaughter.  But other scenes just seemed way, way, too strange and out of place.

And two other problems with the episode, while I'm criticizing:

1. What happened to Donna when she was out on the street with lots of Master copies coming after her?  She seemed to be remembering, and it was killing her, but all of a sudden she has some pulse come out of her and kill the Masters around her, knocking herself out too.  The next time we see her she's just waking up, having forgotten what happened.  The Doctor says something like, ""She's my best friend, do you think I would leave her undefended?""  What is he talking about?

1. Why does the regeneration destroy the TARDIS?  9 regenerated into 10 inside the TARDIS, and it seemed undamaged then.  So why is the TARDIS crashing now?

**TL;DR: The ending of The End of Time could have been really beautiful, with 10's pain and fear clearly on display.  Instead, we got a weird series of scenes which are completely unexplained and baffling.  It's like they tried to make it so emotional that they stopped trying to make an iota of sense.

I appreciate this story broke a week ago, so this is a little out of date, but I thought i would share my opinion.

Simply, someone took, and sold photos of our beloved Kate which have now been published. This was when she was out and about topless. Firstly, it is important to note that she had every right to be dressed as she was. Everyone is allowed to be in any state of dress they want in a private setting, especially newly weds on holiday. I honestly find it humanising to find out that members of the royal family are sexual beings, who are capable of relaxing, and chose to relax by stripping clothes off. My sort of people!

I feel that the news focused on how it was ""scandalous"" that someone would have the audacity to take these photos. How this is a breech of the privacy of the royals, it is in no way in the public interest. It has since focused on how unusual it is for a pair of royals to take legal action against the publishers.

Admittedly, it has often been said how this was a breach of privacy, but this is only news because of the fact that it is our beloved Kate who has had these pictures taken. Unwarranted pictures are taken of famous (and usually attractive) women all the time, recent examples of this include Emma Watson as soon as she turned 18, and how Sienna Miller was chased down the street by photographers.

I'll get to the point, it is wrong to publish pictures of people without their permission. I'll admit when people are caught breaking the law, they are not going to grant permission to have their photo published, but there is a genuine public interest in these cases. It is not in the public interest to show us that Kate is human, and shock horror, sometimes doesn't wear clothes. Nor is it public interest to say, a celebrity has gained weight, or someones nipple fell out.

I feel it is wrong to breach privacy under the guise of freedom of the press. I appreciate it is difficult to define limits, as press freedom is important in a democracy.

There's the Victoria Inn, with occasionally (once every other month) a band I might like to see. There's the Flowerpot, which has a couple more gigs every now and then... and that's about it as far as I can tell.

I'm not saying Torres needs to bang in a hattrick every game or he is useless. I'm purely questioning his position. I'd appreciate your thoughts on the matter.

This thought popped in to my head earlier. Torres has a fantastic workrate and should be congratulated on it! He is always tracking back and trying to win balls and that's great. But maybe he is defending too much? Maybe if he was a bit more 'selfish' and 'lazy' he would be in better position through his lack of tracking back. I appreciate that Torres gets heavily marked by defenders in the box and as a tough time, but you have to remember when people played against Arsenal last year, they knew RVP was the main threat and yet he would still wiggle out and score. The same for Aguero at City and Rooney at Man U. Furthermore if you look at some of our recent goals where Ivanovic, Cole have scored Torres isn't in an attacking position at all. In fact, in many he isn't even on camera with the attack.

This may be a reason why is assist count as gone up. He is not playing in a Striker position but more a number 10 position. But we already have 3 of those!

Link to song: [Soul Meets Body](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEVS1KY-exY)

Lyrics:


I want to live where soul meets body

And let the sun wrap its arms around me and

Bathe my skin in water cool and cleansing 

And feel

Feel what its like to be new






Cause in my head there's a Greyhound station

Where I send my thoughts to far off destinations

So they may have a chance of finding a place where they're

Far more suited than here



I cannot guess what you'll discover

We turn the dirt with our palms cupped like shovels

But I know our filthy hands can wash one another's

And not one speck will remain




I do believe its true 

That there are roads left in both of our shoes

But if the silence takes you

Then I hope it takes me too




So brown eyes I'll hold you near

Cause you're the only song I want to hear

A melody softly soaring through my atmosphere




Where soul meets body




I do believe its true 

That there are roads left in both of our shoes

But if the silence takes you

Then I hope it takes me too



So brown eyes I'll hold you near

Cause you're the only song I want to hear

A melody softly soaring through my atmosphere




A melody softly soaring through my atmosphere

It has been pointed out here before that this series has a running theme of the Doctor wearing dark ties. This was broken during the last episode. More specifically, whenever The Doctor first shows up he is wearing a black/grey tie, and switches to a standard red one somewhere half way through. 

In the beginning of the episode, The Doctor seems to be trying to steal Rory and Amy away from their regular lives, in spite of the slow invasion. They argue that they can't leave due to the drags of their real lives, and Rory even states that what The Doctor does isn't everything. Hurt by this, The Doctor goes off on his own for an undisclosed amount of time. The Doctor is also extremely bored just being with them in their normal lives, and clearly wants to take them on adventures. The Doctor also leaves in spite of the cubes being on Earth, which unless he knew nothing would happen for a while would likely not be a very good move. I contend that this is the future Doctor, coming back to visit the Ponds. This is how he knew exactly when to arrive at the beginning of the slow invasion. This is how he knew he could take them off for a while for more adventures and still return in time. This also explains why he left, as to not overlap with his past self.

After their wedding anniversary, the red tie Doctor shows up. He offers to stay with the Ponds, and says that this time he'll be better after Amy asks if he'll be bored to death. I assume this is a cover, as he likely has no idea what it is she's talking about. He also tells Brian that nothing will happen to Amy or Rory, which we know can't be completely true given the anticipation of The Angels Take Manhattan and how it will be the last episode for the Ponds. I believe this is The Doctor who does not know the future of the Ponds. This is him taking them away before what is technically their last adventure.

~~My theory is the dark tie Doctor~~ These episodes represents key emotional and attitude states of the Doctor, and humanity and these episodes are embodiments of His needs/desires maybe fears. ~~I'm about to watch all four again and see if I can nut this out more.~~ But my theory at this stage is this:

Asylum of the Daleks was about nemesis, on the antagonists home turf and using hope as a motivator.
Hope (Oswin), love and renewing love (The Ponds), humans as emotional creatures.  
 
Dinosaurs on a Spaceship was about manipulation of the villain, relatively neutral ground, space adventuring in it's simplest form. 
It's also the most companion heavy episode so far. See 'gang', never had a gang before. It's new. 
Humans as team players, as problem solvers (button-pushers, Brian's pockets)

A Town Called Mercy was about the Doctor of Justice. Archetypal historical Earth setting.
Humans with crowd mentality. With fluid morality. Survivalists. It took The Doctor to get them to work together, taking a chance to beat the threat.

Power of Three was antagonism by subterfuge. Modern Earth setting. New villain from the Doctor's past/Gallifreyan folklore. Humans being curious. See ""Early adopters"".

Am I being too broad with this?

Also when The Doctor is talking to The Master, they talk about ""choosing"" their names. So what if ever Gallifreyan has to take on a title instead of a name. 

I also want to point out the fact that NO ONE knows the Doctors name. Even when the witches that use the power of words in the Shakespeare episode say basically that he is one without a name. 

Finally it could be that when River Song whispered something in his ear in the silence of the Library, that it was that he doesn't even know his name, not his name itself. That would make him cry.

Quoted below is the email I just sent them, though after I submitted it, I just got some advert for mobile insurance with some cunt dog chewing on a laptop and no confirmation that it actually got sent.

&gt;Hi,

&gt;I recently had problems with my phone, it was failing to turn on or charge, and so took it to a Three store here in [location]. I was initially fobbed off with the suggestion that it was a battery problem and that I should try a new battery (no offer to test any battery they might have in the store). I got a new battery, tried it, and it didn't work.

&gt;I went in again, and this time they agreed to send it off for repair. I was told that it might take 1-2 weeks, but since I assumed that I'd be able to use a spare handset in the meantime, this would be ok.

&gt;I got my spare handset sent and tried my Three SIM card in it, to no avail. I went back in to the store to learn that I can't use a 2G handset on the Three network, unlike every other network, and so I was stuffed. The only suggestion that the useless but polite man in the store had was to buy a spare 3G handset. Apparently you sometimes have loan handsets, but only when its convenient for you, and not enough.

&gt;I found out that my phone wasn't even sent off for repair until Friday, and by Monday hadn't been looked at yet, and it might be another week before I can actually communicate with people. I had given my number as the contact point when it's repaired, but evidently I can't be contacted since I can't use a spare phone, so I'll just have to go in and annoy the staff every day from now on.

&gt;So, let me get this straight, Three:

&gt;- Doesn't let you use 2G on its network, but when my phone worked it often showed only having 2G signal and not 3G signal.

&gt;- Takes weeks to do repairs, not even bothering to send devices off for repair until it's convenient for you, not me.

&gt;- Doesn't stock enough loan phones for customers that might need repairs, considering that they can't use spare handsets that they might have with the Three SIM card.

&gt;- Thus Three compeltely fails to look after customers when their handset fails and leaves them uncontactable for weeks on end.

&gt;Possible solutions you could have considered:

&gt;- Allow 2G phones of Three customers to use the roaming network that Three has for when there is no 3G signal. I can't imagine this would cost much, especially when I'm already paying my monthly contract.

&gt;- Made sure you have a suitable number of loan phones in stock in stores and offer to order them when there isn't. Actually bother to mention that there aren't any in stock when there aren't, instead of letting customers think they can use a spare 2G phone.

&gt;Unless there's some remarkable turn-around, I won't be renewing my contract with Three in April and will be actively dissuading friends from getting new contracts with Three.

&gt;Regards,

&gt;[flangeball]

I can't imagine other networks have the same issue with 2G spare phones, so use them, not the useless cunts at Three. Looks like I'll have to continue relying on other, less reliable, forms of communication.

edit: I'm aware that Three is a 3G network, though wasn't aware that they'd ended their roaming deals.

I've worked all kinds of jobs but I would prefer to go into something Film/TV/Music/Journalism related. 

I have a BA Joint Hons from the University of Nottingham in Film and Television studies with Hispanic Studies (Spanish and Portuguese).

I have experience in development/research, casting, physical production, screenplay analysis, distribution and digital media. I am veering towards acquisitions/sales/distribution/finance/script-reading but am currently open to all sectors of the entertainment industry.

I'm extremely personable, flexible and a fast learner with a solid work ethic.
In an ideal world, I'd love to screenwrite full time but as you may imagine, it won't be paying the bills any time soon therefore something interesting/remotely creative that pays at least minimum wage to sink my teeth into would be greatly appreciated.

It's probably a long shot but if you're out there I'd love to hear from you.

Thanks for reading.

I wrote this on a friend's wall all of two minutes ago, but I thought despite it being poorly written, /r/doctorwho might appreciate such a bizarre happenstance. I considered modifying it, but it's sort of funny now that I reread it to see just how freaked out I was in the midst of even typing out what happened to me.

Just for some context, I'm an American and my front yard isn't exactly large, but the front window to my house is long enough in width that you can essentially see the whole thing from the living room almost edge to edge. That being said, here's the dream:

Just took a nap and had a weeping angel dream omfg. I was at my house and it was xmas and I was alone and it was nighttime when I notice a weird statue sitting on a snow bank facing my house from where I normally park my car. I'm fixing up some stuff at my house when BAM, I look outside to see the streetlamp flickering and the statue had ever so slightly changed position.

Of course I thought, ""This isn't Dr. Who"" lol, and kept along in the living room. Curiosity got the best of me though and I look outside the window.

**OMFG THE ANGEL IS HALFWAY DOWN MY FRONT YARD**

So I rush around trying to keep eye contact with the angel while looking for a mean's of escape or to destroy it. I realize I have something in the kitchen like a crowbar but when I get to the kitchen, it's [the angel] already at my side door so I run to my front door to try to escape and in opening it, I see the fucking angel at the bottom step.

Naturally I had locked myself out of my fucking house at night on xmas so no one was around in the neighborhood and I had no means to get back in, so I reach for the nearest xmas decoration — a clay xmas tree — and slam it into the angel and everything shatters to pieces. I run up to it to make sure it's dead but of course I'm still locked outside so I try smashing open my front door, only to find that it unlocks itself for me…

The second I close the door behind me, I hear a slam from the kitchen and freak the fuck out. My mom just got home and she's all smiles. She gives me a hug when all of the sudden the house lights up completely and a booming robotic voice says, ""THIS IS SMARTHOUSE 2.0. I DEMAND THE RELEASE OF THE REAL ROSE TYLER OR ELSE THERE WILL BE CONSEQUENCES…… THIS HOUSE WILL BE PARALELLED NEVER TO RETURN…… IN CANADA.""

It's just like a child realising his parents aren't gonna be around all the time, so he gets depressed. Of course he won't show it up, but should not be taken lightly as the episodes come up.

Of course the new companion should bring some novelty but in the end, like he did for Rose, he has to regenerate and let go of the Ponds.

BUT, hypothetically, if I were to get offered a job by promising to get my licence as fast as possible, how long would that take? I have a valid California licence and drive manual transmission in the States. I would want to take a couple of lessons in the UK as I've never driven on the left side of the road. I can spare the expense once it becomes necessary (and there's a promise of a future income...) and can even hire a car until I find the right junker to buy. I know I need a provisional one first, then take a theory test, then a practical. But how quickly can this be done??

-Which are the cheapest/most trusted bike shops in Cambridge?

-Mountain bikes are cheaper, but are they a good idea? Are hybrid/dutch bikes significantly better in Cambridge?

-Is a long-term rental a good idea? City Cycle Hire offers 9-month mountain bike hires for 95 quid, including lights, lock, and service, which seems to be my best option so far. Is there a catch?

-What is a reasonable price to pay for a used mountain bike? A hybrid bike? From a store? From Gumtree?

-Is Gumtree worth the 20-30 quid difference, seeing as I won't be able to return it/get free service?

The silence will fall when the question is asked.

It is pretty clear the question is doctor who.

The silence is a religious organization trying to stop the doctor.

By being a good guy he has many enemies.

This means he is notorious and this is why suffering/chaos/pain seems to follow him.

Oswin Oswald deleted his name from every database. This means he is no longer being followed by his enemies.

This means he can do good without being followed by the silence or other enemies.

The problem is that a few months ago there was identity theft on my bank account, my savings were taken and those shitty loans like Wonga were taken out on my name leaving me in deficit. My parents bailed me out as I went to the police, bank and solicitor to sort it. The solicitor cleared my name from the loans, the bank closed my account and opened another one, whilst the police opened investigations into who took it.

Frankly, I agreed with him, noting that the episodes felt bare without anything to mix detract from the uncomfortable silence in many scenes. After reviewing an episode or two, I thought that I might start a project in my spare time to take music from the past couple series and use the songs to help make the episodes ultimately better. 

However, knowing that this would be a lot of work, I'm asking for reactions of everyone in this subreddit (as a community) whether you think it would be worth my time to add tracks to The First 7 Doctors, or if it's not worth the effort to gain a few fans of the Classic Series.

To give everyone an idea of what I'm aiming for, I did a slightly rough mockup while waiting around in class. [Here it is.](http://youtu.be/tYKblWOySko)

I'm a first year student in the UK, coming from a European Union country. So, as I described in the title, I'm in a quite of a pickle. A bit of backstory: I've been looking for a flatshare that would be priced a bit more adequately than the uni halls, as I can't get any maintenance loans or some such. Since July, I've been in contact with my friend, a second year student, who also wanted to move out of the halls and find something cheaper. We were looking at some flats throughout the month, and have found several nice ones, but haven't really decided on anything particular. Then, two weeks before the end of August, I've lost contact with my friend, and was forced to search for something for myself. I've found a great, reasonably priced room, when the friend suddenly reappears with a flatshare of 5 including us, and tells me that everything's arranged and that I need to send the first month's rent tomorrow, or the landlord can't give us the house. I was quite surprised, as the rent was quite a bit higher than initially expected, but the damned camaraderie in me made me do it, which, I now understand, was my biggest mistake. The fact that I didn't have to sign anything seemed a bit weird to me, but I figured that I'll sign it when I'm there.

Two weeks in September, I arrived in the UK, and finally stepped into my room, and was immediately struck by the condition of it. I'm not going to go into details, but it's enough to say that living in this room is nearly impossible. At the time I thought that I could somehow fix the abundance of problems, and was quite preoccupied with the university induction, so I didn't contact the landlord right away. Mistake number two. Also note that the landlord didn't contact me himself, either to request me to sign the contract, or to introduce me to the room or at least the inventory list. Yesterday I finally realized that the room isn't worth my money or my energy, so I emailed the landlord, describing all the flaws and notifying him that I'll be moving out at the end of the month, as there is nothing to oblige me to stay. The landlord contacted me straight away and offered to fix everything on my list, which I refused, because he couldn't possibly fix some of the main issues, and I've already found a room very much better than this one, and much cheaper as well. Then his tone changed to rude and somewhat threatening, while telling me that when I have sent him the rent, I have entered into a contract and that my signature (or the lack thereof) doesn't change anything. 

I find this very hard to believe, and ask of you guys to help me out in this. There must be someone who could've been in the same situation, or at least know how the relevant laws work here. Thanks in advance!

P.S. Sorry for the tapestry, **TL;DR** version is the second paragraph. :)

AotD was good. Very good, really, but its ending with the ""Doctor who?"" line like the last season's finale did was perhaps a little much.
DoaS was pretty bad. Interesting concept, but spent too much time pushing the Mitchell and Webb robots (whose comedy was not written in a way which meshed well with the show, IMO). We see that little 'darker Doctor' at the end when he lets the escape pod be blown up, but where do we go from there? Nowhere. Back to normal, happy Doctor.

In most of them the writing is rushed, and the plot focus between A and B stories in each episode is blurred. Also, I thought we were losing the Ponds. Why did we bring Rory's dad into the picture? I love the character, and the actor, but did we really need him?

I can go on and list the faults of each episode, but suffice it to say that Season 7 sucks. The ideas are all great, but the storytelling is crap. It's almost embarrassing. I was going to introduce some friends to the show this season, but I don't think I want to after seeing how it's gone.

**EDIT**: We have our common factor: Chibnall. Writer Chris Chibnall is responsible for DoaS and Po3, both of which stand out as the cruddier of the season's episodes, IMO. He's got great ideas, but should probably co-write or make two-parters instead of cramming every idea he has into a single episode, like it seems he did in Po3. Also, he should probably lay off the voiceovers, IMO. Chibnall is also responsible for ""Pond Life"" (very cute online interlude, congrats to him on that) and 2-parter ""Hungry Earth"", which was much better done than his last 2. Still, when writing nearly half a season's episodes, you got to get your act together Chibnall!
Still very disappointed.

I think there is a general consensus that the episodes are not in order, but I haven't found any explanation that explains many of the inconsistencies I find. Therefore, I've decided that I think there is no possible order to the episodes. This is based on two observations people have pointed out in this subreddit. One, there is an ongoing conversation about King Henry VIII and it seems to go in order of episode four to episode three to episode two. However, in episode four, The Power of Three, we can see the stetson hat with a bullet whole through it from episode three, A Town Called Mercy. The conversation about leaving a phone charger in Henry VIII's suite has to have happened after The Power of Three, where the gang hides in his suite, yet the stetson from A Town Called Mercy, bullet whole and everything, is clearly seen in Amy and Rory's house in The Power of Three.

Given this inconsistency, I'm just assuming that there is no logical explanation to the sequence of the episodes. Rather, it's all wibbly-wobbly timey-wimey, which I think is something that is intentionally done by Moffat. If, by the end of The Angels Take Manhattan, we don't see a clear order of the episodes, I think we should just assume that there is no order. Rather, space is being wibbly-wobbly and time is being timey-wimey.

but what if on doctor who the different colored time voretexes (or whatever the plural of vortex is) indicate that what we are seeing is out of sync, indicating that the first 3 episodes are not in their right order? and the somewhat proper vortex from this past week indicates that this episode is the start of something but the ending color of the vortex indicates that something isn't ending right? furthermore, what if next week's vortex starts with the wrong color but ends with the right one on the title card?

moffat isn't new to using colors (bow ties in season 5) to play tricks on us (2nd part of the angels episodes where the doctor's magically color changing bow tie and jacket was instantly thought to be a continuity error) and he was the one who told us originally that his bow tie was important.... and what did moffat say before this season? he was talking about how the credits for each episode were unique. what if he said that to guide us into figuring out that the colors meant something here as well?",false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,null,null,self,I bet moffat is a fan of fringe (new S7 theory right here),1,http://www.reddit.com/r/doctorwho/comments/10fdwd/i_bet_moffat_is_a_fan_of_fringe_new_s7_theory/

Some are good, some are okay, and some are fandamntastic. Today I was reading the EDA novel *Vampire Science* and noticed a couple of things. First was how the Doctor introduced himself to another character in the novel: ""'I'm a Time Lord,' said the Doctor.
'From the planet Gallifrey in the constellation of Kasterborous.' 'Moreover,' said the Doctor, 'I'm a former President of the High Council of the Time Lords, Keeper of the Legacy of Rassilon, Defender of the Laws of Time and Protector of Gallifrey. I'm called the Bringer of Darkness, the Oncoming Storm, and the Evergreen Man.'"" That sounds so similar to the introduction the Doctor gives his fellow passengers on the Titanic in *Voyage of the Damned*. Second of all was a confrontation between the Doctor and UNIT's General Adrienne Kramer. She was calling him out for manipulating his companions for their own good, and for endangering them because they all wanted to impress him. Sound familiar? It should. We hear Rory and later River giving him almost the exact same speech. The themes that we're seeing explored now in New Who have been brought up before, and it's wonderful. Heck, the new character, Kate Stewart, is from one of the novels. 

It made me realize that most of the people who have worked or are working on Doctor Who now, R.T. Davies, Stephen Moffat, Nicholas Briggs, David Tennant, probably a lot of others too, they were fans during the dark years when the show was off the air. When no one was making Doctor Who except fans. And those people, they did in the late 90s what we're all doing now. They got on their message boards and they shared their fan theories, and they obsessively read the books that kept the show alive, they wrote their own books, filmed their own fan movies. 

I know that some of us prefer the emotional connection of Davies stories. Some of us niche players prefer Nicholas Briggs' descent into madness and darkness in the Big Finish stories. And some of us prefer Moffat's timey wimey craziness, but Doctor Who is really, REALLY big. It's probably the biggest coherent story telling feat that we've got on the planet. Star Trek comes close in scope, but there isn't a lot else. Not really. I mean, Harry Potter is seven books. Seven pretty good books, but that's it. The Whoniverse is big enough to get lost in. Big enough to stake out your own corner and claim that it's better than all the other corners. But we shouldn't be doing that. We should be celebrating how awesome the whole is, and how lucky, how truly lucky we all are to be along for the ride. Maybe Moffat's created a character you just can't stand. Maybe R.T. Davies created a character or two you just can't stand. Maybe David Tennant haunts your dreams and you just can't stop wishing he would come back. But they're all bits and facets in this wonderful, awesome world we're so privileged to share in. 

We're in good hands folks. These people loved the show as much as we do. Nobody is ruining *Doctor Who*. They loved it so much they freaking brought it back from the dead. We all have different tastes, and none of us are going to get everything we want, every season. I just hope we can stop all the fan hate and the nerd rage and actually enjoy the damn show. 

I'll close with a quote from the acknowledgements section of the book I just finished: ""And finally, a hearty thank-you to Phil Segal and everyone else who helped make the telemovie – you folks gave us all these neat new pieces to play with in the greatest Lego set ever invented."" That's what these stories, characters and arcs are: neat new pieces in the greatest Lego set ever invented. EVER. 

**tl;dr Nobody is ruining *Doctor Who*. The creators love it as much as we do.** Edit: fixed the tl;dr

Chris Chibnall has had two episodes already this season, not weird, except for the fact that they both struck me as having a Doctor that doesn't care as much about being a knight in shining armor anymore. 

* Dinosaurs on a spaceship: the Doctor enrages fans by not only letting the villain die, but he actually plots his death and sends him to his doom with a smile and a quirky remark.
* The power of three: the Doctor finds a bunch of people locked up in a spaceship, clearly unable to save themselves, and he completely ignores them. He only cares about saving Rory and Brian. They had plenty of time, but he just didn't care.

There's a clear trend here, the Doctor now obviously cares more about his companions, but now he doesn't care as much for anyone else. Maybe whatever happens when Amy and Rory leave the show just makes it worse. One thing is clear: this is shaping the Doctor's character.

Then I looked at Chibnall's other writing credits:

* Pond Life: yeap, he wrote all of Pond Life, so he's not only writing episodes for the show, he's involved with shaping the whole feel of the show for the season.
* Season 5: he wrote ""The Hungry Earth"" and ""Cold Blood"" bringing the Silurians back. Also shows a darker side of the Doctor when he snaps at Ambrose, he almost wants to kill her, or let the Silurians do it. But this was the hero phase for the Doctor, so Moffat would not have allowed it anyway. He used the Silurians again for DoaS, so maybe they'll become his ""pet"" race like the angles are for Moffat.
* He was the head writer for Torchwood, so he has the Sci-fi credentials right there. 
* He wrote two episodes for Life on Mars... drama credentials: check.
* Worked as the showrunner for Law &amp; Order UK. Management backing: double-check
* Also showran Camelot recently... unemployed with lots of time to sink into Doctor Who? triple-check.

He even showed up on a TV show in 1986 as a representative of the  Doctor Who Appreciation Society to complain about how much the show sucked back then!

I know that Moffat hasn't said anything about leaving, but I also know he can't stand still. And Chibnall looks like he could be a great replacement and give us what RTD couldn't back in season 1: a dark, surly Doctor that sticks around for a while.

See, when he regenerated there was a little bit of relief (not much) in that while the actor had changed, at least the character was still there. The doctor persisted. I was upset, but of course, fell in love with Tennant.

  Now with me standing by the theory that, the 12th Doctor will give us the Valeyard(though Moffat is not a fan of bringing a character casual viewers wouldn't remember) I also think it would be the only story point where he becomes female. Mostly because my theory of Rivers regenerations playing havoc with 11ths regeneration, and she herself has been female from the start. 

Though I personally don't want to see it(i'm just not fond of a character im used to seeing male becoming female..). If they did it for a series or two, and used her as a way to get the Doctor to understand the past mistakes he made. 

I feel it would be like making Bond a girl...One movie could work but overall the character has been a man for fifty years.
