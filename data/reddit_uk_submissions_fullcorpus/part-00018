Has that completely been thrown out the window after a poor run of results?

Yes, the media are having a frenzy about it, and, with Abramovich's record with hiring/firing managers, it does seem unfortunately likely that he could be replaced. But think about this for a second, Wenger hasn't brought in silverware in YEARS for Arsenal. Let alone the fact that their season has possibly been even worse as they were considered title and trophy contenders for most of the season until they completely dropped the ball. Now, Chelsea are having a good run and are in second, when even a champions league spot was a worry earlier in the season! What about the little victories? What about faith in developing a team and a strong managerial history?

I believe Carlo Ancelotti is a fantastic manager for Chelsea and in general (proven record). If Abramovich truly wants that long sought after Champs League Trophy, he'd be best to follow what the top clubs who've actually won it (ie. Fergie at ManU and Pep @ Barca) and NOT be constantly hiring/firing managers (sorry, COACHES).

Anyways, I'm just venting, especially due to all these stupid articles about replacing Ancelotti being thrown about (Rafa? really? let's look at his recent record...).

I have 4 years administrative experience, 1 years retail experience and a years writing/reviewing experience. I have written an original stage play that was performed in Belfast's Grand Opera House and produced by a major local theatre company. 

I have been unemployed for 6 months. I apply for about 20-30 jobs a week. I have had one interview in 6 months, for a ""trainee recruitment agent"" that I didn't get. I can't afford a new formal shirt to attend interviews in, not that I even get them - that last interview I attended I wore a too tight shirt that was ripped at the back (I don't think they noticed... but that's not the point.)

I'm young, talented, experienced and I can't even get a job as a cashier. Should I just do a TEFL course and bugger off? (200 quid I don't have.) 

The UK seems to have nothing for me. It doesn't value any of my work experience or academical achievements. I don't want to work in telesales or recruitment. I can't afford to do a masters. I can't afford driving lessons to become a taxi driver.

I hate this situation - it's dragging me down and depressing the hell out of me. I speak to local recruitment agents on a weekly basis that seem wildly inept, I see misspelled job adverts everywhere - I cannot get a job. I can't afford to go to job interviews in England as I'm on jobseekers and I can't afford the plane fares. I am actually starting to lose my mind a bit because of this entire situation.

I've had my CV looked at countless times and I tailor my CV to suit each application. I write professional, concise cover letters. I've got no criminal record. I can't start a business since I have no capital. 

Seriously... what the hell am I supposed to do? 

People talk about how rich the UK is - they don't speak for me. We are in a depression, not a recession. I live on less than £10 a week. (11p tesco noodles thank you very much.)

I'm have family in town for this Easter weekend, and as a result I won't be able to watch the new episode on BBC America.  I have to go to a dinner with family, and won't be able to watch the episode when it premiers with my girlfriend, one of our favorite things to do.

My question is, when will the episode air in Britain, and how quickly can will there be a copy up to download/does anyone know where to find a good one right off the bat? I can join her to watch a few hours before it will air here, but I am trying to figure out if there will be enough time before I have to head out for dinner.  I am in the Mountain Time Zone, and I know there is about a six hour difference from the UK, but I didn't know if anyone knew for sure when something like that would be up...

*DW - kills/is open to killing/puts in second place:
    - Starwhale [last of it's kind]
    - W.Angels 
    - Saturnynians [last of their kind]
    - Silurians [last of their kind]

* Humanity is more important than those ""last of their kind"" species. - And then in ""The Hungry Earth""/""The Cold Earth"" - the humans he's putting on a pedestal - one of them screws humanity over by killing (accidentally) a Silurian. - Luckily, they were put back to sleep.

* Humanity/Van Gogh kills (accidentally) a blinded Krafayis in ""Vincent and the Doctor"".

* The Lodger, we get introduced to something that:
    - Can screw with the Tardis
    - &amp; A messed up sudo-Tardis-thing? - That was in trouble and desperate for a pilot
    - Where did it go?

* The Pandorica Opens/The Big Bang:
    - Everyone points their finger to the Doctor because of the Cracks
    - The Tardis is being controlled
    - The Silence seems to be controlling it [""Silence will fall"" w/crack inside Tardis] - and River is inside of the Tardis
    - Romans were created from Amy's mind-stuffs to capture the Doc 
    - The Silence? wanted the universe to seize to exist?
    - The Big Bang happened - so who came back from it? - Are the Angels back because of it? Is Real!Rory back?

I'd love to discuss all of this. :)

Is it possible for us to ever get over him? Are we lying to ourselves if we don't mention his name?

Will we always remember him for breaking our hearts, like an ex-girlfriend who got away?

Deep down is Fernando Torres so popular because he's got a great smile and he's tall? (via subconsciously favoring tall people over shorter people like Villa or Messi)

I seam to have lost my speech. When I look what is happening to BBC and UK. So I have cleaned my Reddit Post to make myself clear.

To any one who loves there Home and a Organisation. What represent every thing true and
Great about the UK. The British Broadcasting Corporation.

I ask you this what dose the BBC 606 Message Board Represent to you? Is it just a simple place for stupid useless discussion. Or dose is it a factory for Creativity education  and relaxation for now and next generation of UK Economy?

And by killing it have we broken the Core Principle of the BBC Royal Charter. A Charter what
was built on the strength of people who fought for in the past for a Creative Strong and Fun
United Kingdom.

This is not just about 606 or the Old BBC, it is about loosing the places what might just give us hope and new direction in the Deepest Depression. And if the UK Government goes and
slaughter the 606 thinking it only a simple game. When where will they stop? When there is a cold raw and dark useless Home.

When you are sick. You don’t go stop eating the food that make you well. You adjust and
Optimise your eating patens focusing on the things what are core to making one well.
Countries Economy needs Creativity to build and one what is their own. 

If you feel you are wise in life. Then read these links below and make a critical decision before
you vote up or down. Sir Winston Leonard Spencer Churchill said “Once in a while you will stumble upon the truth but most of us manage to pick ourselves up and hurry along as if nothing had happened.”. Don’t stumble be wise. Tell me off if you want.

1. The forgotten time ""'We shall fight on the beaches' by Winston Churchill (1940)""

2. A BBC Royal Charter to know

3. What  is happening

Something about this is screaming TARDIS but I can't figure it out.  Stetson doctor didn't interact with the TARDIS  at all.  why not?  why send the invitations if he could just hop over and pick everyone up?

We had a great time and followed ""The Impossible Astronaut"" with ""Midnight,"" one of our collective favorite episodes.  


Around 11ish, my friends leave and I decided to do a load of laundry. (because it was a saturday night and what else do cute college girls do on saturday nights?)  The laundry machines in my building are in our moderately creepy basement (lit by flickering fluorescents and full of random discarded and broken furniture, etc) three floors below my room.  I lug my basket down and start loading the washer (which themselves are located in a weird, pipe-lined, too-small room with a little vestibule off the back that leads to another mystery room) without incident.  


45 minutes later I go back down to switch from washer to dryer.  In this period of time, I have (stupidly) been thinking about the [Silence](/spoiler) and, for some reason, the [Vashta Nerada](/spoiler) from ""Silence in the Library"" and ""Forest of the Dead.""  While moving my laundry, I keep looking behind me into the little vestibule-room, trying not to get too creeped out.  I do okay, but once my laundry was moved I *booked it* back up to my room.

An hour passes while my laundry dries and in that period of time I've gone back and watched scenes from ""The Impossible Astronaut"" as well as bits from ""Silence in the Library"" and ""Forest of the Dead"" again (because I am very stupid and like scaring myself, I suppose.) Once my laundry is done, I go back downstairs to fold my clothes.  I'm totally keyed up and nervous, but I turn all the lights on and put one earphone in and listen to some music as I fold.  Right as I'm finishing folding my TARDIS t-shirt, I see something out of the corner of my eye and I actually scream and drop my clothes.

What **I** saw was: A tall, thin figure with arms outstretched in a black suit, casting a long and skinny shadow into the room, AKA [A Silent MIXED with a Vashta Nerada shadow](/spoiler)

What it **actually** was: A tall, thin campus security guard in the normal black security outfit, stretching his arms while doing his rounds.

He was, obviously, startled and shocked and asked if I was okay.  I explained that I'd been watching a scary sci-fi show and had freaked myself out because there were tall guys in dark suits, etc. etc.  The security guard, without missing a beat, says ""Oh, I watched that episode before I got on duty!  [I bet Amy's not really pregnant.](/spoiler).""  Then we chatted about theories for five minutes before he went back to his rounds and I went back to folding.


TL;DR: I freaked myself out so much thinking about The Silence and other monsters that I thought a security guard was an alien, but he turned out to be totally awesome.

He met Amy and Rory while driving the Edsel.   He took everyone to the picnic with the Edsel.  Where did he park the TARDIS?

Previously the idea seemed to be that you should never interact with yourself in that current timeline once events had begun to unfold, or to make it simpler everybody had their own unique timeline that they couldn't go back on, for instance in Fathers Day back in S01 (new) they were ok to go back and witness the event of Roses father being killed but they couldn't interact with themselves and the moment that they changed Roses personal past (saving the dad) and interacted with themselves (Rose holding herself as a child) simply put all hell broke loose to try and fix the timeline.

In my opinion this was how Dr. Who set up its time travel lore because it also meant that the doctor couldn't simply escape from any situation that he's in by creating a paradox, a time loop or something along those lines, yet with Moffats episodes this is pretty much exactly what happens such as in the Big Bang S05 (new) where his future self goes back on his own timeline to get himself out of the pandorica and now with him [sending a 200 year younger version of himself an invite to his own wake](/spoiler) .

Personally I feel that this takes a lot away from the series, I really loved the Silence in The Impossible Astronaut and the dark turn that Dr. Who has taken but the fact that there doesn't have to be a clever solution to the problem at hand and can easily just create a paradox to save him from pretty much any issue without consequences has frustrated me a lot and of course for the start of season 6 this does mean that [they can tell the doctor he will die and he can stop it](/spoiler) with no consequences.

I don't usually make a lot of posts (in general, but especially speculative ones like this) but I want to throw this out there for you to hear your thoughts:

[I think the Silence are villains, plain and simple. I've seen some theories bouncing around that they're not too bad, but I see no way they could be good or neutral. I have no idea what their goals are.](/spoiler)

[But! I have a theory on how to the Doctor and co. will beat them: The Ood. They're a telepathic race as we've seen, and can sing across the cosmos. That said, if one Ood sees a Silent — the whole race could theoretically know about it. Even when you look away, the telepathic network could remind you. That's how I think they will be beaten.](/spoiler)

[Second, I don't know how many of you watched the long trailers for the season, but there's that half-second clip of some kind of explosion in the 9/10's TARDIS with Amy and Rory. My thought is they need access to the core to save the Doctor and avoid a paradox. Sort of like what Rose did in series 1's finale. They're not going to have an opportunity to do that in 11's TARDIS without him finding out what they're trying to do.](/spoiler)

[THAT SAID: I don't think we'll see 9 or 10 again, my suspicion is they'll somehow get into the TARDIS mid-regeneration during the 11th Hour's timeframe. The Doctor can't get in, and will have no idea what's happening.](/spoiler)

I could be totally off-base, but this is what I've been mulling over almost obsessively. Comments? Tell me to die in a fire?

EDIT, one more thing after sleeping on it:
[River didn't know this death was coming. Her diary has all of the Doctor's faces in it, or says as much. This pretty much says her whole story will be resolved with Matt Smith's doctor, since she doesn't react in saying ""This isn't right, he's supposed to have one more..."" or anything like that. Anything beyond 11 will be totally new (and history rewriting) ground for her.](/spoiler)

[Also: I seriously doubt it's River who kills 11 in the Impossible Astronaut. She knows his name, and seems shocked to have seen him die. That pretty much says the conditions for knowing his name excludes being his killer, she knows it some other way. Also, for as good of a shot as she is, she totally missed and/or didn't phase the space man. She conveniently has a revolver instead of Jack's (well presumably according to the side-plots, but that's another discussion) gun, which probably would have gotten the job done. This is an earlier River, yeah, but very convenient. And yeah, I'm obsessing.](/spoiler)",false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,null,null,default,Some theories on Series 6.

""Silence"" is very different than ""The silent""

""Silence"" implies the idea of silence. Such as the extinguishing of the galaxies. 

""The Silent"" implies an entity or a group. 

Does this mean that The Silence has nothing to do with the ""silence""? No. 

I believe they are the cause of the crack from
Last season and they are involved with the anti-tardis but I have yet to see any S5 references to ""The Silence"" proper just to ""Silence""

EDIT: In the scene where the doctor cops it from the astronaut (Why are you reading this if you don't want a spoiler) You can see a distinct black figure.

Putting a number of threads together, it appears that the Silent need the Doctor alive. Thinking back to the Lodger, the faux TARDIS was looking for a pilot, and humans didn't work. However, when the Doctor was close enough he was recognized as a pilot. 

I'm guessing the Silent have been setting traps for the Doctor over time to try to get him to activate their TARDIS, something he has to avoid at all costs. So he has been running, running harder than he ever has before, to try to escape them. He finally decides the only way to escape them, to prevent them from having access to the whole of time and space, is to die (or at least to appear to have died from the Silent's point of view). This is similar to hiding in human form / fob watch in the Family of Blood. 

Perhaps his death is staged, and the real doctor has been absorbed by the Astronaut to be resurrected later. When the Silent confronts Amy in the rest room, she is instructed to tell him what he cannot know. This appears to be an attempt to prevent him from dying. 

However, the Doctor is brilliant at piecing things together. When River says Spoilers to who has sent them on the mission, this is a dead give away. Spoilers for the Doctor can only involve the Doctor, so she has basically told him that the instigator is himself. This, plus Amy's action of trying to kill the astronaut, gives him enough info to plan his death to get the Silent off his back while he works out a way to defeat them - just like his 'death' by the Dalek gave him time to get into the Pandorica.

Thoughts? I haven't seen the preview, so have no idea how this pans out. I'm wondering how much of this will be resolved in part 2, and how much will be left dangling until the end of the season.

Edit: Just thought of something else. We see the Doctor (with a beard) presumably at Area 51 in the preview. An assumption is that he is being interrogated by the US because he is an alien. But if the Silent are really in control (they have been controlling our lives for a long time) then it seems more likely the Silent are interrogating him. Could they be trying to pry the secrets of the TARDIS from him in this scene, and this is the pivotal moment where he realizes he needs to run?",false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,null,null,self,Impossible Astronaut Theory [spoilers + speculation],56,http://www.reddit.com/r/doctorwho/comments/gx207/impossible_astronaut_theory_spoilers_speculation/

When in the bathroom with the Silent, it tells Amy that she must tell him the ""thing he doesn't know"" and ""the thing he must never know"". Now reading all of the posts here on /r/doctorwho, it looks like everyone has come to the conclusion that the one secret was Amy being pregnant (which I don't understand why people would assume she's lying about, but whatever) and the other being that River, Amy &amp; Rory know how the doctor will die. What if the less important secret was that they were at his death? What if the bigger secret was about Amy's unborn child? 

When Amy said, ""How do you know about that"" while she was confronted in the bathroom, her demeanor was that of shock. There's no way it could've been about the doctor's death, because they were there anyway. Amy saw the silent on a rock and (I assume) it watched the entire thing go down. Plus she said that she remembered seeing it there too. Which for me kills the ""Death secret"" entirely. I think that the secret has to do with Amy and the doctor together.

I think you need to relax. From the watching of Doctor Who that I've done, one thing seems clear. The BBC and the writers they hire to run Doctor Who are not overly concerned about consistency. They cheat. Remorselessly. Sometimes connections exist - like the brilliant Doctor wearing his jacket scene from the angels episode last season - but at the same time be aware that you may be disappointed looking for threads. In particular from discussions in the last two days: 

- the silence looking slightly like the ood

- the use of ominous little children voices or eery children

- the silence power reminding people of the angel power

- etc from the Lodger, Angel episode etc.


is as likely to be about Steven Moffat pulling again and again from a limited bag of narrative tricks as it is likely to be a consistent thread.

Also, the effect of the Doctor knowing of or intersecting with his own timeline is applied completely inconsistently. So your best bet is to just not think to hard about it... sort of like that scene at the beginning of Austin Powers 2.  Just accept the stakes and constraints laid out in Act 1 and enjoy the ride. You'll just end up annoyed looking for cross arc consistency in Dr. Who.

When you see Amy Pond's house from the outside, it's clearly two stories. Many people have mentioned that there's an extra staircase in her house -- there's one from the ground floor to the second floor, and then one from the second floor to ... where? Sure it can be to an attic, but I don't by that. 

So here's what I'm thinking:

The extra staircase is very reminiscent of The Lodger episode. And that extra staircase was going up to a TARDIS. Which is why I wonder if there's a TARDIS (not grown like the Doctor's, but one someone's building) above Amy's house. That way they could watch her and the Doctor, etc. Perhaps at some point they plan to lure her up those stairs so she could be their pilot -- or at least get trapped up there so the Doctor would have to come and save her/be forced to be their pilot?

It's already been made clear that there was a perception field around the room Prisoner Zero hid in, perhaps there's also a perception field around the second staircase. 

Sorry if this is crazy, but it's just something I've been dwelling on. Can anyone build off this?

1. Does Canton end up on Torchwood? Think about it.

I doubt it). I think they're introducing a new character. Also, it would add a whole new layer of meaning to the ""but you'll be seeing a lot more of me"" line that I find completely irresistible.

2. This is slightly wilder, but it's also incredibly appealing to my brain: I think The Silence were human. One, they're wearing suits for no damn reason. ...That's really my only proof. But, think about it: kidnapped humans who were forgotten (or maybe even covered up or given to the aliens--this is *Nixon*'s presidency) and have been operated on until they become these things that not only live in secret, but physically *can't* be noticed for more than a few seconds?

I have number of theories I need to bounce off of everyone, and most of my friends aren't as into the series as me:

So I have decided that every episode from Series 5 has major implications on the Series 6 plot (examples below- I'm bolding the ""most important"" ones in relation to my Silence theory, and mentioning some continuity stuff)

* *Eleventh Hour-* Introduced Smith as the Doctor (obviously), introduced Amy and Rory, and features the scene with Amelia that is returned to in Big Bang. Also has the ""big, empty house"" that we return to in Pandorica/Big Bang
* ***The Beast Below***- Introduces Liz10, who returns in Pandorica Opens. Relationship with Elizabeth the First mentioned. Also introduces the idea of an all-powerful, non-human driving force behind an empire (similar to the Silence- a subtle introduction, perhaps?)

* *Victory of the Daleks*- Re-introduces the Daleks, introduces the ""Power Rangers"" Daleks (ew) who return in Pandorica/Big Bang, but so do the original Daleks. Also begins the idea that the crack is eating Amy's memories. Churchill and Bracewell return in the same Pandorica/Big Bang sequence as the others.
* ***Time of Angels/Flesh and Stone***- This one is huge. First of all, this introduces the idea of a past/future doctor, which majorly factors into *Impossible Astronaut*. We see River again, and Amy pushes the idea that she could be ""Mrs. Doctor from the future"". The Doctor speculates that the cracks in time and space are connected to the fact that Amy could not remember the events of ""*The Stolen Earth*"" and ""*Journey's End*"". He also mentions the duck pond without any ducks from ""*The Eleventh Hour*"". The crack eats some people, and eventually the Angels. Also the idea of Amy's wedding gets introduced. 

~ The next two episodes are both weird, in my opinion, because they do not blatantly introduce any plot points we have run into yet, but they do so subtly. More than meets the eye with both of them~

* ***Vampires of Venice***- **First mention of the Silence**. Rosanna mentions cracks through which other worlds and people can be seen as well as the fall of silence (a phase I'm going to return to later). Rory's first episode.

* *Amy's Choice*- First of all, introduces the idea that the Doctor hates himself more than anyone else in the universe. This is **huge**. Secondly, the relationship with Elizabeth the First is mentioned yet again. I can't help myself, but I want to point out that although the mentions in *Shakespeare Code* and *End of Time* were funny and passing, it's been pushed this year. Maybe there's a plot point coming up? Just a thought...

* ***Hungry Earth/Cold Blood***- A terrestrial villain with a prior claim to the planet... sounds a lot like what we've heard of the Silence, huh? We lose Rory, which is huge, and it shows that no matter how important a person is to you, the cracks can make you forget them. The Doctor pulls a TARDIS piece out of the crack.

* ***Vincent and the Doctor***- First of all, this is my favorite episode from the season. Mostly because I'm a mush who loves Vincent. First of all, we have the double entandre of the ""monster only Vincent can see"" (his depression and the Krafayis). Van Gogh is able to sense Amy's sadness at Rory's death, similar to how Rory is able to sense Amy's sadness at losing the Doctor, and how Amy is able to physically sense the Silence? More on that later. Van Gogh also has the visions that lead him to paint the TARDIS picture used in *Pandorica/Big Bang*.

* ***THE LODGER*** (otherwise known as the most important episode of the series)- There's a little girl asking for help. The makeshift TARDIS control room reappears in *""The Impossible Astronaut""/""Day of the Moon""*, apparently connected to the Silence. 
Corden will return to play Craig during an episode of the sixth series in 2011. And some unknown force is trying to keep the real TARDIS away from the makeshift one, while pulling the Doctor close. I honestly think this is the most important episode of the series.

* *Pandorica/Big Bang*- I know these have been analysed to death, so I'm only going to mention that which relates to the new series. River's... River-ness with the marriage line. Huge red herring, imho.

* *A Christmas Carol*- Only thing to mention is the song lyrics: *""When you're alone, silence is all you see,/ When you're alone, silence is all you'll be./ Give me your heart to come to me./ When you are here, music is all around./ When you are near, music is all around./ Open your eyes, don't make a sound.""* Sorry, this has to be significant. 

**So what does it mean?**

First of all, what do we know? The Doctor is his own worst enemy. Rory wants a family with Amy badly (I think she *is* pregnant, btw- something other than that would be too complex for a family show). And there's a homemade spaceship built by (we presume) the Silence that uses a little girl to pull potential pilots to it. According to casting, we're returning to the location of *The Lodger*, or at least the cast. There can be two Doctors in the picture at once (and two of anyone- remember Time and Space?). And something is significant about the name Joy.

What do I think? Maybe the Silence are trying to recreate the Doctor to power their TARDIS. Remember what was said in *Pandorica*- the belief that ""only the Doctor can pilot the TARDIS"" is pretty widespread (even though we all know that is not true, thanks to River and Romana). We find out who River is in Episode 7 (which is also supposed to feature Cybermen) so I'm not even going there. The Silence kidnap Amy in the second half of Astronaut. My theory is it is because of the baby. 


Finally: Silence will Fall. When something falls, it loses power. But when silence (no cap) falls, it pervades the scene. So this is a double entandre. *When you're alone, Silence is all you see*.... Amy only encounters the Silence alone, or is *made* to be alone. *Open your eyes, don't make a sound*... See what is going on, but don't let others know. 

So will the Silence fall, or will Silence Fall? Any ideas taken from what I have said are more than welcome... I'm just information distilling here.

This is really the cause of most of series 5. It's also got to be a key point in this season. Even the Doctor seems to be glossing over it thus far. 

Sub questions:

* Who would have the motivation to try to destroy the universe? Especially given the amount of baddies that were part of the alliance to stop it. You could pretty reasonably rule out the Daleks, Cybermen, etc.
* Who would have the means? Getting into the TARDIS, much less sabotaging it is not a simple task. How many can even fly the thing? River, obviously. Probably less than a handful from the old series. And, while this is a bit off the wall, Timelords. But they are supposed to be dead or timelocked.
* Regarding the Silence. Before the TARDIS starts to blow, you hear a sinister voice saying ""Silence will fall"" (if I remember correctly.)

This means I will be discussing who will play in the three forward positions.

On our current roster (including those on loan) we have the options of playing **Drogba**, **Torres**, Anelka, **Sturridge**, Kalou, and Malouda (Kakuta and Borini haven't shown that they are ready to be considered for a starting spot yet, and Borini is out of contract after this year).  We are also likely to bring in one or two from the options of **Neymar**, Sanchez (Alexis), Hazard, and **Aguero**, among others. That leaves us with 7 or 8 players competing for 3 starting spots, and likely only 5 or 6 roster spots.  

The main question we are facing is whether Torres and Drogba can play together in a 4-3-3.  The gut reaction is no, since they haven't done it yet.  However, watching both of their play this weekend may have changed my mind.  While neither player has been scoring much recently, they both have seemed to have improved their supply to their teammates.  It is telling that every chance Chelsea created against West Ham when Drogba was on the pitch, went through Drogba.  This trend continued when Torres replaced him, setting up Anelka, before scoring himself, and setting up Malouda in the end.

Many people think there is no room for Drogba with Torres on the team sheet, but I still think they might be able to play very well together.  If Drogba stays, which probably would only happen if he continued to start, then 2 of the 3 starting spots are likely locked up.

This leaves us to consider who would be our third forward.  Anelka has proven himself time and time again at this level, but I think I am in the majority in the belief that his time at Chelsea is coming to a close.  I think Sturridge has more than shown he is capable to start for Chelsea.  I think Sturridge will take Anelka's role for the team.

This would leave a starting forward line of Sturridge-Drogba-Torres. This gives Chelsea a lot of versatility up front, as each player can both supply and score. All three are also almost equally as good with both feet, meaning positioning can be rotated throughout the game, driving defenses crazy by making it difficult to track each player.

With Sturridge's youth, it would be advisable keep multiple options for cover (and for when Torres or Drogba get days off).  Of the non-Chelsea players that we seem to be interested in, I believe Neymar and Aguero are most suited to play as a forward in a 4-3-3 (I think Sanchez and Hazard are more suited as true wingers in more of a 4-4-2 type of system).  Malouda can also cover on the left, but his lack of supply to his teammates throughout his career has been troubling (I could easily see Malouda leaving with the purchase of either Neymar or Aguero, helping ease the massive transfer fees both are likely to incur, along with any fees acquired from the sale of Anelka). Kalou is also good cover, and is a very good squad player, seemingly content with his role, but I would prefer him to not be starting for Chelsea when we are at full strength.

One thing struck me as odd in rewatching the impossible astronaut. How does River suddenly know Rory now and then conveniently forgets him later? In the Pandorica opens he's just ""That Centurion"". It's now evident that she's met him before, and being a time traveler from another timeline Rory being erased from time should not have had an effect on her.

Question rephrased: How come she knows him now but **also** forgets him later. I understand an episode comes up where they probably first meet, and that's where he and Amy possibly need introduction, but **why in a later episode is he completely unknown to her**?

Logical Reasoning: The explanation Amy was given about why she could remember the Clerics was because she was a complicated time traveler now and the reason she had forgotten Rory because he was from her direct timeline.

To River, Rory should be no different than a cleric was to Amy. Otherwise how does the doctor remember him, or how does River remember the Doctor for that matter? Amy was special in the sense that she can bring people back. But River didn't even forget the doctor because she gave Amy the journal. It just seems weird to me.

I was watching The Impossible Astronaut when River started talking to Rory down in the sewer. How one day she'll look into her eyes, and the Doctor, ""My Doctor"", won't recognize her.


Considering her personality and closeness to the Doctor, I think there's an interesting chance she might be the TARDIS somehow in human form. Remember when the TARDIS spoke through Rose, speaking of ""My Doctor""? Now I know a single line is hardly evidence, but the way the Doctor describes the TARDIS when he personifies it...


Well, anyway, that's my speculation, I'm really looking forward to finding out who she really is this season, I just hope it's still mesmerizing, even if it does get spoiled.

so in the impossible astronaut river and the doctor are syncing up their diaries going over everything they've done, right? and that was with the 1100+ year old doctor. her doctor. and he dies. now all of us being people of reasonable intelligence know that the doctor will in the course of the season end up changing his fate but what if while doing so he ends up changing his and river's fates as well and the doctor that she knew and the experiences they had never happen because of it?

i remember there was an episode where she said that the doctor taught her how to fly the tardis, then there was another episode where she said she learned from the best but implied that it wasn't the doctor who taught her. that would buy into my theory that the dead 1100+ year old alternate doctor was the one who taught her, but since he dies and then the 900+ year old doctor ends up changing his timeline that... crap... i'm losing the point of my theory...

anyway this all leads to how i think the villain of this season is going to be river. she's going to reach a point where she has to decide between doing something that leads the doctor down the path that leads to his death on the shore (while she gets to spend all the time with him in between) and a path that leads to him and her never spending all that time together but he doesn't end up dying on the shore...

now if thats true my other hunch is that she and rory will connect over the course of the season (relax... not in a romantic way) and somehow he'll be the lone person in her way and she'll have to end up killing him, or accidentally killing him. the guilt of it leads to her being in stormcage and part of her sentence requires to her participate in these events with the doctor to make sure that somehow the doctors fate on the shore doesnt come true.

The gypsies in the show put on extravagant wedding costing tens of thousands of pounds. Yet the issue was never raised of how that money is actually obtained. Gypsies are largely uneducated and many probably illiterate. They have no vocational skills and the majority of which are almost certainly unemployable; especially in a day and age when even the most experienced and educated people struggle to find employment. The only thing a gypsy has going for them is the fact that they don't pay tax.


Throughout the series the documenters were refused to be told how much anything cost– this has to be a massive sign that something is definitely dodgey in how they get their money. Whats more I cannot believe is that gypsies themselves reported that the documentary was biased AGAINST them, when all it seemed to do was portray them under heavily rose tinted glasses, what more do they want? They’ve won millions over with this sickly propaganda that all gypsies are highly moral misunderstood members of society. Kim Jong-il would be jealous.


But how do they make these fortunes which don't get taxed and with which they can pay for extravagant weddings? Firstly what are gypsies most known for? That’s right stealing ‘pikey just nick it’ I know it’s a stereotype but its true. This will not bring in a lot of income for them but will bring in things which they need. They steal land from people which – if they ever leave – will be littered, polluted, unusable and cost the poor farmer or whomever they stole it from time and money to get it cleaned up. In addition people who store peoples caravans while they are not in use frequently get raided by gypsies looking to get a few caravans (one of our caravans included).  You can delve all the way back to highschool, I remember the gypsy kids always coming back from the local corner shop with more stuff than they could ever pay for. This is incredibly hypocritical from a community which throughout ‘MBFGW’ claim to be roman Catholics and to have high moral standards. Apparently they can’t even adhere to ‘thou shalt not steal’ although being able to read would probably help.


Lets take their moral standing down another few notches shall we? Now we delve into the criminal underworld. This is where the gypsies make their big money and it’s not through drugs. Firstly there is a lot to be made from underground boxing, gypsies love a good fight. Though it is not that bad, albeit quite dangerous. Aside from illegal boxing, where gypsies make most of their money is in grievous animal cruelty, namely; dog fighting and badger baiting. These vile, beastly ‘sports’ are where pikeys are getting a large amount of their money. They will bet on and breed dogs to fight and they will go out and capture badgers – by filling in the holes of their sets, gassing them out, capturing the largest ones and leaving the young to die. An adult badger can fetch them £3000 - £10,000. They will force the badgers to fight against each other or against dogs. Badger fighting dog is even more brutal and disgusting than any other type of fight, as the badger will literally tear chunks of flesh from the dog. I cannot think of anything more cruel or disgusting.


If you have any concern for animal welfare do not have anything to do with gypsies. Also if you are the sort of person who wants to go ahead and defend gypsies I will go ahead and guess that you have never met a gypsy and have never experienced gypsies before.

Then, dressed in the space suit he enters the TARDIS of his past self and lops off one of the past Doctors hands. This, of course, grows back due to regeneration energy. He then keeps hand in a similar receptacle to 10ths hand.

It could also explain why he is late getting back to Amelia.

Now he travels to 2011 and lands the TARDIS in the lake. Emerging from the lake he visits the future Doctor (who has spent 200 years enjoying himself immensely knowing this moment must come). He kills the future Doctor with a modified Sonic that not only kills during the regeneration cycle, it also absorbs the regeneration energy.

He then lands his TARDIS close to the future doctors TARDIS. Carries the hand into the future TARDIS and releases the regeneration energy into the hand.

That's why the silent gets angry at Amelia in the restroom scene, he says, ""you tell him what he must know, and what he must never know, tell him..."" To me, this seems like a begging request that Amelie must tell the Dr what he has let happen, to prevent the universe from falling into silence.
As the silents have lived alongside man for centuries, perhaps they are trying to intervene on mans behalf by preventing the Dr screwing up history (after all, he has let his ego get too big and messed up history before. what is to say that this time he is unable to stop himself, fueled by curiosity about river and inner tensions [like the dream lord]).",false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,null,null,default,What if the silents aren't the real enemy here?

We mainly support adult offenders, and young offenders, with their re-integration into mainstream society. We have a particular focus on stopping re-offending through behavioural change and mentoring support.

In March 2011, we lost a fantastic project in Birmingham due to funding cuts. The project IMPACT, supported young offenders through giving them the support of a paid mentor. The project was very successful, and through the efforts of the staff team, many of the young people re-engaged with education, training and employment. However, since the project closure, there is simply no comparable service left, leaving many of the young people likely to slip back into the cycle of offending.

The Co-Operative have made some funding available for initiatives such as this, all of which are open to a public vote. We are hoping to run an NLP course (not everyone's cup of tea, I know) to help the young people change the root of their offending behaviours. If you feel this is a cause you can get behind, then please vote for us!

I think the title of the episode could be a misnomer to throw us off the scent. Perhaps finding out River's identity [isn't the main point of the episode, but rather something that's thrown in (probably at the end, so it leaves us all wanting to know more).](/spoiler)

The difficulty I have is that my in-laws will also be flying in that day from a different city, and they are arriving at a different terminal. We won't have cell phones to contact each other, so we will need to make arrangements to meet at a location that are pretty solid.  We arrive in T3 at 10:05am, they arrive in T1 at 10:10 am. We'll both need to get through customs and immigration, but it should be faster for us as I'm a British Citizen.

I will have an iPhone, but I don't know if there's free WiFi in the airport. I'm also not sure what phones/computer my in-laws will have (this I will check). I will not be jailbreaking my phone so won't have local phone service, though we are considering getting a rental wi-fi hotspot to give us net access wherever we are. However, that doesn't help if my in-laws don't have any wi-fi access even if they have an appropriate device.

Once arrived, we'll likely be taking the Picadilly line up to KingsX to get to our final destination.

What I want is for a good suggestion for where to meet in the airport that we can plan on ahead of time. My gut tells me to make it easiest on my in-laws, unless that would take us really out of the way for getting the tube.  For communication, I'm sure we can get some English moneys and find a payphone (wait, are there still payphones?) to check in with my family - I'm thinking we call when we arrive/clear customs. If the other group has called first, we know they arrived OK and are on their way to the meeting point.  If the other group hasn't called yet, we make our way to the meeting point and then call every 30-60 mins in order to check in and see if they arrived yet.

I have tried to tell her that almost every episode has important stuff in it, but she insists she only has the patience for 2-3 episodes per season.  I gave it a shot, but I just couldn't trim it that much.

She has only seen A Christmas Carol, which piqued her interest in the show.

Any suggestions for changing/adding/subtracting?  Just the ""essential"" episodes... (e.g. NOT Unicorn and the Wasp, which I didn't like anyway)

Season 1:

~~(1.) Rose~~  (I tried re-watching this the other day - didn't like it)

(6.) Dalek

(9.) The Empty Child  **added**

(10.) The Doctor Dances **added**

~~(12.) Bad Wolf~~

~~(13.) The Parting of the Ways~~

Season 2:

~~(1.) The Christmas Invasion~~

(5.) The Girl in the Fireplace

(13.) Army of Ghosts

(14.) Doomsday

Season 3:

(11.) Blink

(12.) Utopia

(13.) The Sound of Drums

(14.) Last of the Timelords

Season 4:

(9.) Silence in the Library

(10.) Forest of the Dead

(13.) The Stolen Earth

(14.) Journey's End

The Waters of Mars **Added** 

The End of Time

Season 5:

(1.) The Eleventh Hour

(4.) The Time of Angels

(5.) Flesh and Stone

(7.) Amy's Choice

~~(8.) The Hungry Earth **Added**~~

~~(9.) Cold Blood **Added**~~ (but might just show the last few minutes with Rory/Tardispiece)

(10.) Vincent and the Doctor

(11.) The Lodger

(12.) The Pandorica Opens

(13.) The Big Bang

I tried to keep story arcs together, but... I may have missed some or screwed it up. I know you people know this stuff better than I do - I've only seen each episode once (except season 5 - at least twice. heh).  I know I've cut out some great stuff, but tried to keep in my favorites, like Silence in the Library.

Thanks for any help!

She has now gotten her kids hooked on the show as well (she blames me, and I'm okay with that), and they're watching all of the episodes on Netflix in an effort to try and catch up.

Well, out for another visit, and so we all decided to watch a couple of episodes together and last night was ""Utopia.""  When it was done, my cousin looked at me with an unusual look and said ""So... who the hell is The Master???""

I quickly explained, but realized that there is no way to really sum up ""The Master.""  So, I was wondering if any of you had any recommendation on your favorite Master story arcs from the original series that I can point her to?

Again, I will be assuming Chelsea stay in a 4-3-3.

On our current roster we have midfield options of: Lampard, Essien, Mikel, Ramires, Zhirkov, Malouda, Benayoun, McEachran, and Clifford (Melis and Cork are both on loan, but I don't think they will feature in our first team plans next season).  I could see us (possibly but not likely) bringing in another, more creative midfielder to compete with Lampard on the left, but I don't think we need to, nor do we have the room for them.  That leaves us with 9 players fighting for 3 spots.  Clifford will probably stay in the reserves, but I included him since he has been playing very well for them, so realistically 8 for 3.

Lampard and Essien are the big question marks here.  They both are coming off arguably their worst professional seasons in a Chelsea shirt (ignoring the season Essien basically completely missed through injury).  One has to wonder if their recent injuries are catching up with them.  Essien also faces serious competition for his spot in the team from Ramires and Mikel.  Lampard has been hounded this season for his performances, especially when coming back from injury while the team was playing the unfamiliar 4-4-2, which doesn't exactly suit him.  This elongated the time it has taken for him to return to form, but his last match against West Ham was arguably his best of the season.  He doesn't have to look very far over his shoulder to see the future of Chelsea waiting in the wings to take his spot however, in young McEachran.  In the mean time, Malouda and Zhirkov have shown they can also deputize on the left, but they are more suited for wider and/or more forward positions.  Benayoun has also shown in his few appearances this season that he can bring a nice spark, but I don't see him as much more than a spark off the bench to change the game.

If Lampard and Essien retain their starting spots, that leaves one more opening in the midfield.  I, among others here, consider Essien more suited to play on the right side of the middle as a box to box type, with Mikel playing the more defensive holding role.  I do think, however, Essien can play the holding role as well, especially with the memory of what he did against Gerrard in the champions league thriller with Liverpool a few years ago, essentially marking him out of the game and making him invisible.  I do think the injuries have taken their tole on his knees however, and am not sure he could still replicate the performances that earned his nickname as the Bison.  I think that Ramires (especially after a season to settle in the league, and hopefully after eating some more to build on his frame this summer) could step into the midfield and truly succeed for Chelsea.  He would take Essien's place on the right forcing him to the holding role or the bench.

With that in mind, I think there are three options for Chelsea's midfield next year

&gt; Lampard --- Mikel --- Essien

&gt; Lampard --- Mikel --- Ramires

&gt; Lampard --- Essien --- Ramires

I think McEachran will and should get the Sturridge treatment and get loaned out to a premier league team next season, possibly following in his footsteps at Bolton.  I must say the lineup for the future would probably look along these lines:
&gt; McEachran --- Mikel --- Ramires

We've recently learned that during one of the later episodes, we re-visit the byzantium. We see River crawling out wearing fatigues, and referring to an older Amy as 'Mother'. Granted, there is the possibility this is a red herring, and has been filmed to throw us off whats really happening, but let's run with it for a bit.  
  
Now, River says she went to the Stormcage for killing the 'Greatest Man she Knew, a hero to many"". Now, I don't know about anyone else, but most little girls see their FATHER that way. Whether true or not, I think River may actually kill Rory later on in this series.

I'm currently a US student who will soon be taking the SAT, SAT subject tests and AP exams in the coming months, and hoping to do quite well on them. On the Oxford website, it says the requirements for a student in the US system are: 2100 or above on SAT, a score of 5 on 3 separate AP exams/700 or above on 3 separate SAT subject tests.

Let's say, for the sake of an argument, I get a 2270 on the SAT, an 800 on the world history and US history SAT subject tests, a 780 in the literature SAT subject test, a 5 on an AP US History Exam, a 5 on an AP Chinese (I am white, if this has any relevance) exam, and a 5 on an AP English exam. Obviously these are close to if not the best possible scenarios for most of these exams, but if I were to get these marks, what would my chances of successfully applying to Oxford be? Fair chance? Strong chance? Meh chance?

On top of this, I plan to take a gap year of sorts, though it is a little out of the ordinary (to my knowledge at least). I plan on spending 6-8 months in the Chinese mainland to solidify my Chinese, and spend what remaining time I have in the Middle East to learn Arabic. That is my ideal plan as of right now, though in the end if the Middle East part doesn't work out, so be it.

My studies at Oxford, should I attend, would revolve around language, foreign affairs, these kind of subjects.

So, Reddit, if you have taken the trouble to read this, thank you.

Things appeared to be going fine until NAMA apparently refused the latest payment, causing the site to be closed down until further notice. The latest I've heard is that Glenkerrin are done for good now. But obviously this hotel is going to have to be finished right?
My question relates to the fact that my Dad's company are the electrical contractors on the job and have laid around £20k worth of cable which hasn't been paid for yet amongst other things.
What happens now? What can my Dad do about settling his debts with Glenkerrin? Will NAMA honour anything or are we going to get fucked over by other companies being hired to complete the job?
I'm doing my best to offer my dad advice on the situation but I'm slightly out of my depth. Any information on the situation would be much appreciated.

After a series of events, the Doctor puts (or is forced to put) his memories and time lordliness inside his watch and becomes human. 

Then in 1955, he slips and hits his head on the porcelain, and has a vision of the flux capacitor. He then spends the next 30 years building a new TARDIS, so that he can again travel in time with his new companion Marty McFly.

At first I agreed with the commenter, it would have made a great callback to an older episode.

However, thinking about it later, it hit me that while we would have seen the quip as a joke, the Doctor would never have made a joke like that. Remember that the 'who turned out the lights' were the last thoughts of a dead crewmember, not necessarily a close friend of the Doctor's, but someone that was part of his 'team' on that particular adventure. With the emotion involved in that entire episode, the repeated dying thoughts of the remnants of their mind, I really don't think the Doctor would have brought it up as a joke.

Traditionally this has been regarded simply as a some sort of spatial warp that connects the interior of the TARDIS, which is large and ""elsewhere"", to the smaller exterior.  But the Doctor has never actually explained it this way.

In *The Robots of Death*, the Doctor explains the principle to Leela by showing that a larger cube could fit inside a smaller one if the larger cube was farther away.  But what if that's another way of saying that the larger cube actually is smaller?

In *Planet of Giants*, the TARDIS doors are opened mid-flight before materialisation is completed, presumably long before the Doctor learned to activate shields to allow for this sort of thing in later episodes.  The resulting ""space pressure"", as the Doctor called it, caused the TARDIS to materialise only 1 inch tall, and the occupants to emerge the same way.  Could this have been a failure of the dimensional stabiliser?

In *The Time Meddler*, the Doctor sabotages the dimensional stabliser of The Monk's TARDIS.  The result is that when the Monk tries to enter the TARDIS, he discovers that the inside is *too small*... the inside is now the same size as the outside.  He can't fit his whole body through the doors... perhaps because passage through the doors no longer shrinks him down to TARDIS size!

In *Carnival of Monsters*, the TARDIS is again minaturised when they are caught in the ""compression field"" of a Miniscope and materialise inside it.  But why would the compression field effect the interior of the TARDIS?  Only the exterior should have been shrunk.  So if the interior was truly normal size, they should have opened the doors to discover they were too big to get out!  But instead they are the right size... perhaps because they are already small?

In *The Invisible Enemy* and *The Armageddon Factor*, the Doctor uses the TARDIS dimensional stabliser to shrink himself and Leela/Drax.  Why would an integral part of the TARDIS involve such a dimensional transformation unless it, indeed, was used for exactly such a purpose inside the ship?  The one problem with this is that we see the Doctor and Leela inside the TARDIS later without the dimensional stabiliser, and the the Doctor says its absence merely prevents them from dematerialising.  But perhaps this was a different but related component.

Bottom line: the dimensional stabiliser always seems to be involved in making things small; we never see the TARDIS too large.  Thus, the inside of the TARDIS isn't really bigger than the outside... everything inside is simply shrunk!

Of course, it wouldn't so much be a fight as much as a battle of wits, but there is not enough prep-time in the universe for Bats to be able to get the upper hand on the Doctor.

Never thought I'd see the day.

Edit: Not that I'm saying the two of them would *have* to fight each other; I'm sure they'd get along quite nicely, although the Doctor would probably disapprove of Batman's use of violence and Batman would probably regard the Doctor with distrust so strong that it borders on hostility. However, seeing as how writers are routinely finding reasons for Batman and his hetero life-mate Sueprman to beat the snot out of each other, it's not impossible to think of a situation where one of them decides that the other one is dangerous and needs to be stopped in order to save lives and as hard as it is to picture Batman being defeated or admitting to doing something wrong, it is damn near *impossible* to picture the Doctor not being clever enough to pull it all off in the end. And although Batman may be physically stronger than the doctor, he'll never be as strong as the doctor is intelligent.

So The silence make Amy (and possibly River) pregnant, hence the sickness, because they know it will create a weird Timelord / Human hybrid, possibly something done by the TARDIS or just somehow because of the temporal energy. They do this because they are looking for a pilot for their home made TARDIS as seen in The Lodger, possibly for an invasion, possibly to leave. The Doctor is too powerful, he stated himself that if it used him he the whole solar system would explode. 

The girl is the Timelord / Human hybrid and quite possibly Rory is not the father, possibly the baby was created by The Silence using The Doctor's DNA somehow? Remember The Doctor's Daughter, Jenny?

It's been a real treat to watch the show and I have been powering through season's 1 through 4 in only a few days. So in a spur of the moment I put together a new bag for going around town together quickly last night. I made it with some extra fabric I had around my house using a pattern I made from a free Japanese bag I got in a magazine before. So please enjoy the following pics of the bag.

I had started recording on my camera before the police approuched me and they forced the camera from my hand and held both my arms as if I was a criminal.  I was asked for my details but refused to give any untill I had been told what law and what crime I had commited.\n\nThe officers could not tell me what crime but were only able to use Section 60 which is a stop and search power.  Everyone has the right not to give their details during a search.  They then asked me if my bank card which they took from my pocket belonged to me.  I told them that it did and they arrested me for Suspicion of Handling Stolen Goods. (The card belonged to me).\n\nBefore my arrest I had arranged to give my footage to the BBC and a BBC reporter booked my name with reception.  I was followed from Soho by two police officers in uniform.  I was detained and arrested on Regent Street close to the BBC building.  I found it strange how they would decide to detain me before I could get to the BBC.\n\nAfter I was released without Charge and without Caution after 4 hours I promptly made my way back to the BBC in Regent Street and was finaly able to pass them this footage.\n\nI also want to point out that many people have been arrested over the last two days including Charlie Veitch who is well known for hugging the police (Love Police) who was arrested yesterday.  No one knows exactly what he was arrested for but the footage I have just seen on the BBC of a playright being arrested along with another man who was wearing fancy costume.

Skip the first paragraph.

I feel a bit like I'm walking through a minefield looking for pirate treasure or something trying to get to see this in HD before it gets spoiled.  I came here, even though I plan to watch it on BBCA tonight, and xfinity on Demand later, because my local BBCA doesn't have an HD channel. I saw the Impossible Astronaut first on standard definition and kind of regretted it, probably because the colors looked muted on my TV (rear projection, sensitive to viewing angle). I came here to get the best experience. 

Anyway, please don't put spoilers in your titles, even if it is the name of a Doctor Who confidential. [6x02 Death of a Companion](/spoiler) I still haven't seen the episode, but please, even if that is the name of the Doctor Who confidential episode, change it to something else, like ""6x02 Day of the Moon Doctor Who confidential"". Again, if this isn't an actual spoiler, no biggie, but if it is I'm going to be a little upset. 

Edit: Oh yes, if that title was a prank on us, a fake spoiler to make us yell, then good on you, it was a great gag and thanks for sharing. There are a few other potentially spoilery things by other people, but I won't really know for sure until I get a chance to watch the episode.

After watching the opening two parter there are a lot of questions left. One of the bigger ones is the identity of the little girl. Right now the two most popular theories are that she is either the child of Amy and the Doctor or River and the Doctor. I couldn't disagree with these theories more. For one it is ultimately a kids show. The Doctor may kiss River Song but sex with her or Amy is out of the question. Secondly, the RTD era is over and I think overly dramatic relationship issues are gone as well. Steven Moffat has made it very clear that the seeds for this season were planted over the course of the last season. That being said lets go back to The Lodger. It was an episode that was generally overlooked until the alternative TARDIS showed up. As confirmed by Confidential the TARDIS we see in the Two Parter is in fact the same one from The Lodger. Now here is where the spoilers come into play. Craig Owen from the Lodger is coming back this season and he is now a father [as is evident from this photo](http://i.imgur.com/4PLBV.jpg). What if when The Doctor merged his mind with Craig he became somewhat of a Metacrisis timelord somewhat like Donna. What if his child with Sophie who along with Craig touched the TARDIS controls is the child in the spacesuit. Maybe both of them being ""time travelers"" of sort from touching the alternative TARDIS controls and being involved with the events from The Lodger and Craig sharing the Doctors mind resulted in their child being a time child, the same time child who regenerates at the end of Day of the Moon.

Is being Gallifreyan a necessary part of being a Time Lord? For example, I've heard before that there was an aborted story arc with the Seventh Doctor grooming Ace to be allowed into the Time Lord Academy to become a Time Lady. If that holds any truth, then it's possible not all Gallifreyans are Time Lords, and that members of other species can become Time Lords.

We saw in The Five Doctors that the Council was able to give the Master a new set of regenerations. It's implied that they set up the 13 regeneration limit on purpose. Romana was able to choose what form she wanted to regenerate into. If regeneration can be controlled, to an extent, does that mean it's a natural Gallifreyan trait, or something they learned?

Time Lords can pilot TARDISes. If we agree that the ship in The Lodger was a TARDIS, it seems there's some sort of genetic or Time Lord-detecting mechanism within a TARDIS. At the same time, we've seen companions piloting it--River and the group in Journey's End. The Doctor stole his TARDIS; so, I wonder if it's possible for someone else to as well.

We both look at her. ""What did you just say?""

""That's River. In Japanese. But it's backwards.""

I think that Amy really is pregnant, but something about being in the Tardis and traveling through time is making her baby kind of ""fluctuate"" in and out of existence. 

I think that, down the road, Amy will eventually have her baby, and it will be a girl. For some reason, the baby is taken away or she is forced to give it up for adoption. 

Now, in come the Silence, still wanting to find a pilot for their makeshift Tardis. They find out that the girl in the adoption home (Amy's Daughter) has some kind of tie to The Doctor, who they know can pilot a Tardis, so they figure she is a better candidate than any other child. 

Now, they don't want The Doctor because they know The Doctor will be too much, so they capture him and somehow transfer some of his TimeLordy-ness into the girl, thus explaining her ability to regenerate. But, something goes wrong, and the girl cant stay alive, being part timelord is killing her, and they don't like the idea of her regenerating all the time. So they develop the spacesuit with the exoskeleton to keep her alive.

Their goal is to raise her to an appropriate age so that she will be able to pilot the Silence's makeshift Tardis.

But obviously, she doesn't like them because they hurt her in the process of making her part timelord; so she tries to get away and stuff.

Later on, Amy, Rory and The Doctor save her and remove the TimeLordy-ness from her, thus making her human again. And she grows up to be River Song. Maybe. Still fuzzy on that part.

Anyway, after thinking about it a little, I think the 'slimy' equipment that they found in TiA may turn out to be a makeshift Loom, and the little girl is The Silents attempt to genetically create a time lord.  
 
The Doctor planned his own death, and CADIII was called to give them the ability to cremate the Doctors remains, because as River Says ""There are whole races out there that would detroy this world for a single cell (Paraphrased).  
  
The Silents were using the orphanage as a genetic test bed, trying to find the best 'host' for the TimeLord DNA. The little girl is the host, but due to the nature of the DNA, can't stay alive long enough for their needs. The suit was designed to stop her dying and regenerating.  
  
After long enough, the DNA fused allowing her to escape the suit. She still wasn't strong enough to survive, but was able to get away long enough to escape and regenerate at a later time.   
  
EDIT: Some comments below advise that the LOOM may or may not be considered Canon. After a little thought, it may be true that the Doctor was not LOOM born. He speaks of being half Human, which would assume some form of Gestation and Childbirth. Disregarding the LOOM idea, I still think the idea holds some sort of water if you consider it just a Genetic Manipulation by the Silents.

What if everyone is thinking about things from the wrong direction in time with regards to River, Amy and (now) the child? (That River/Amy could be the same person or River could be Amy and Rory's kid.)

What if Amy is the Doctor and River's daughter? With the new child being his grand daughter Susan? (whom the Silence were attempting to/did turn into a full Time Lady for other reasons).

It terms of plot twist it would explain the Doctor's willingness to sacrifice himself to maintain the time line. As he would ultimately know he'd meet his grand daughter again as the 1st Doctor (and that he'd leave her safe in the past/future). It would also explain how Amy is both pregnant and not, owing to a potentially massive paradox if Amy doesn't have a kid. It would also explain peculiarities about Amy and resolves one plot point from the 1st (as in the original run of the show) season that's been speculated through out the run of DW, the origin of Susan Foreman.

(Yes I know we've technically seen Amy's mother and father in the S5 finale, but they could easily be surrogates chosen by the Doctor knowing she needed to be there when he met her. I mean the show has made no effort to flesh them out, so they could just be a red herring for the audience. Wibbly Wobble Timey Whimey)

I had started recording on my camera before the police approuched me and they forced the camera from my hand and held both my arms as if I was a criminal.  I was asked for my details but refused to give any untill I had been told what law and what crime I had commited.\n\nThe officers could not tell me what crime but were only able to use Section 60 which is a stop and search power.  Everyone has the right not to give their details during a search.  They then asked me if my bank card which they took from my pocket belonged to me.  I told them that it did and they arrested me for Suspicion of Handling Stolen Goods. (The card belonged to me).\n\nBefore my arrest I had arranged to give my footage to the BBC and a BBC reporter booked my name with reception.  I was followed from Soho by two police officers in uniform.  I was detained and arrested on Regent Street close to the BBC building.  I found it strange how they would decide to detain me before I could get to the BBC.\n\nAfter I was released without Charge and without Caution after 4 hours I promptly made my way back to the BBC in Regent Street and was finaly able to pass them this footage.\n\nI also want to point out that many people have been arrested over the last two days including Charlie Veitch who is well known for hugging the police (Love Police) who was arrested yesterday.

River dies in silence in the library. Doctor 10 doesn't really know her, not devestated.
They meet over and over, the Doctor knowing her more and eventually falling in love, all the while knowing exaclty how and when she will die.
Doctor gives River his sonic to save her in the library.
River is still stuck in the library computer and effectively dead from the later Doctors point of view.
11th Doctor eventually gives up running from the facts, allows the astronaut to kill him.
If the Doctor allows himself to be killed because he is completely alone, his lover dead, how do you save the Doctor?
You go back to the library.
You save River the same way the rest of the people from the library were saved. You beam her out.
This explains why we see Rory and Amy in the 9/10 era control room in the season 6 trailer.

1)  Rory can sometimes remember that he used to be plastic and that he's lived more than 2000 years.  Amy is sometimes pregnant and not pregnant.  These two symptoms are related.  Evidenced by Rory's first comment ""I was made of plastic"" after The Doctor returns, these symptoms started immediately after Amy remembered the original time stream back into existence.  I gather this means that the first time stream didn't exist at all until that point.  Since that point, the two time streams have been attempting to merge.  In time stream one, Rory is plastic.  In time stream 2, Rory is human.  Only one of those two can make a baby.  Hence Amy's pregnancy/nonpregnancy.  I'm sure there are other side effects of the two time streams merging that we haven't seen yet.

2)  The events that lead up to the Doctor's birth still occurred and the Doctor still exists after the Big Bang II.  That's why the the Earth/universe/time/reality did not dozens of times in the past due to the events that occurred between the first Doctor Who episode and the beginning of season 5.  Amy heard the TARDIS land in her backyard, but didn't find it because the Doctor left.  He had no reason to be there.  Later, Amy remembered the original Doctor back into into existence creating two Doctors.  

3)  We're supposed to assume the Doctor's erratic behavior throughout history, shown in the beginning of The Impossible Astronaut, was meant to catch  Amy and Rory's attention.  I believe it was actually meant to capture the Doctor's attention.  Clearly, the Doctor is smart and he would have realized there are two Doctors in existence.  This could be a problem...

4)  One of those two Doctors arranges his death either because it is necessary, or to throw the Silence off his trail.  Who knows.  Either way, the Doctor we saw die and the Doctor currently on this adventure are not the same Doctor.

Here's where I go out on a limb.

5)  The Silence are capable of interstellar travel.  We know this because they drove the fish people off of their planet in the Vampires Of Venice.  What real need do they have for a TARDIS?  Who would need a TARDIS?  A Time Lord.  With few exceptions, most of the Time Lords are locked into the Time War.  The only extant Time Lords we know of are the Doctor, Jenny, the Master, and Omega.  Well, the Doctor already has a TARDIS, Jenny doesn't have the ability to time travel back to 1960's Earth (does she even know that's where the Doctor hangs out), and the Master is presumably time locked with the Time Lords.  This only leaves Omega, who was locked in an antimatter universe.  I believe Omega needed to do something to get out of the alternate universe.  And these cracks are a perfect way out.  We've already seen in The Three Doctors he can influence things in the regular universe; why couldn't he be the one controlling the TARDIS causing it to explode (River did say she had no control of the TARDIS, that it was piloting itself).   Only Omega is insane enough to get back into the regular universe or destroy it trying.  I believe the Earth Silence are being used as pawns by Omega.

6)  When Amy remembered the Doctor back into existence, she also remembered all she did with the Doctor.  This includes the cracks.  The cracks can't exist without a cause.  So, she also indirectly ""remembered"" Omega back into the Universe.  Now that he's here, there's no need to recreate the cracks.  That's why they didn't reappear in the new time stream.  

7)  Of course, now Omega needs some kind of new body to inhabit.  So he somehow manipulates the new Time Child into existence.

Everything is so over the top its ridiculous. There is literally ZERO suspense in Doctor Who anymore. In the last episode, the doctor dies, and we see him 2 minutes later. In the beginning of this episode, Amy and Rory are shot, and we see them 2 minutes later. 

Don't even get me started on the swimming pool. Again I'm annoyed at how Amy lies to Rory all the time. It's a damn soap opera half the episode. She loves the doc, or Rory. Whoops, now she's pregnant. Whose the father? Drama Drama Drama. I don't want drama like that in Doctor Who. It's supposed to be Sci Fi, despite it now being mostly science fantasy.

I've really tried to get into the new series, being a classic series obsessive, but the new show utterly fails to capture any of the magic and charm of the classic series. Everything is so overdone. I miss the doctor landing on a random spaceship to help solve a problem. I didn't need a map and chart to understand the sequence of events. The complexity of the new series doesn't add anything in my view, it takes away. Piddly references are made to classic series elements, or characters are brought back, but its just not the same. Nor is it an improvement in my view. 

The new series is so epic its lame. Last random point of my non-coherant rant: GET THE HELL OFF OF EARTH. YOU HAVE AN ENTIRE UNIVERSE TO EXPLORE.

Alot of people seem to be saying that the police have arrested people who did not commit crimes, and that they have no right to do this. If you can't be bothered to read/already know the way that the legal system works, go ahead to the TL;DR where I draw my conclusions.

As an FYI, police don't arrest people for commiting crimes. Not now, not ever.
The police arrests people when there is evidence that a crime has been/will be commited; often this leads to innocent people being arrested under suspicion of breaking the law.

After the arrest, the Police take the suspect into custody to examine the evidence, &amp; present it to the CPS. It is the CPS's job at that stage to assess the evidence.
If a case for guilt can be found, it goes to court. If there is insufficient evidence, the arrested suspect gets released without charge.

**It is not the job of the police to assess evidence; they can only use evidence as a justification for arrest, no matter how strong or flimsy that justification is.**

Arrests are a means to either keep somebody detained while certain evidence is investigated; or alternatively to detain them over a period of time during which they may commit a crime.
The police are perfectly within their legal rights to arrest somebody who is not a criminal if there is any evidence that suggests that they may be. The Police are not there to assess evidence; someone's innocence is the job of the CPS/courts to decide, not the police. They can and have to arrest somebody if there is *any* grounds to suspect guilt.

TL;DR

-Police arrest innocent people all the time.

-Being innocent doesn't give you a right not to be arrested, but rather a right that if you are arrested that you'll be later relesed without charge.

That being said I am of the view that the way the Police acted was not right as they gave the ""suspects"" that they arrested no chance to prove their innocence before they were dragged off to a police cell to keep them out of the way during the wedding.

The elegance of their weapon of choice (time), their innocent appearance, and this feeling you had for them where you kinda pitied them and feared them so craftily designed, was gone.

So I decided to kill them. If they're based on quantum wave functions (""quantum locked"") then any sort of observation, visual or not, would ""collapse"" their waveform. So for example hearing them would make them freeze because that's a form of observation. So what if you established a permanent radar beam over them? As soon as the radar photon bounced off an returned, they would have to collapse (""freeze"") for a just a moment, and then another and then another photon. Assuming they don't move faster than light, they're done, frozen forever. They can't just absorb the radar because observation causes them to immediately stop existing according to Tennant. And theoretically, if you decomposed their rocky form far enough, they could never reconstitute it (think vaporization).

The key here is that it doesn't have to be a human observing them, a computer would do just fine. Imagine if you ran a quantum eraser experiment on them... maybe that would just immediately massacre them. 

I think since Russell Davies left as writer, a lot of the simple elegance of the show as been replaced by forceful plot, reflecting the change in the doctor too.

* The Silence have been experimenting on orphans for decades, trying to engineer a pilot for their experiments.
* The little girl is one such orphan. She's not the daughter of anyone in the TARDIS team in the traditional sense of the word.
* In the beginning, Amy was basically an orphan. 
* We know The Silence have been around since The Eleventh Hour.
* My thoughts on Amy are that she was engineered by The Silence for the purpose of getting close to The Doctor. To get ""even just one cell."" Her kidnapping in DotM? Taking what else they need from her.
* ""Your memory is weak"" and yet her memory is why the Universe and the Doctor still exist.
* The Silence didn't anticipate the small details like Rory and the erratic behavior of The Doctor.
* The Woman in the Window: The orphanage had been taken over by The Silence years ago and was where they were raising their engineered child. She's the little girl's nanny and the girl dreaming was space suit girl, not Amy. I think this mostly because I refuse to believe Moffat would a) twice use the same plot vehicle for an entire season and b) do that to us and his story with such an often abused plot vehicle.

I agree with the theory that The Big Bang *didn't* fix everything and we've got two sets of Time Lines weaving in and out of each other.

So why did Prisoner Zero say the Silence will Fall in 2010?  
Why did Amy see a Silent during the picnic in 2011? 

Seems to me like they are still around...
_____________________

But this leads to another question: What did they do that was so horrible, other than killing Joy?  If they had been guiding humanity since Fire and the Wheel, seems like we were doing OK..  If they rid the Earth of the Silence in 1969, seems like this was almost a bad thing.  We haven't been doing so well since then.  Wars, Economic collapse, Environmental damage..   If the Silurians were fine to be here too, why not the Silence?  There are arguements for free will and all, but..hmm..
_____________________

And if you follow the logic, it seems almost like they were trying to leave Earth.   Look at the facts: 

* They are scavengers and do not have their own tech

* They are in possession of a Time Ship, similar to the TARDIS

* River kills the Silents in the ship and it turns up above Craig's apartment

* The ship @ Craigs was looking for a pilot who wanted to leave

* There are multiple references to ""The Doctor in the TARDIS"" and one comment that ""only the Doctor can pilot the TARDIS"" from last series

* The Doctor cannot pilot the Time Ship without disasterous results

* The Silence is in possession of a little girl with the Time Lord-like ability to regenerate

* The Silence was going out of their way to do something with the girl, to the point of creating a space program on Earth to create a space suit for her


So it would seem they found a time ship, want to use it to leave to ??? and need a pilot who can do it.  The Doctor is the best choice, but the ship reacts violently to him, so they need their own Time Lord-like person do pilot it, so they cultivate a little girl to can help them with this plan.  

Otherwise, what was their plan?  They didn't seem to have any other motivation.
_____________________

And while we are at it, where is the 1100-year old Doctor's TARDIS?  Why did he keep it hidden?   Seems like it would have been easier to TARDIS to the picnic rather than drive the station wagon.  Was he keeping it from the Silence? 

_____________________

If River is the little girl, it would explain how she knows how to pilot a time ship and why she wouldn't bring up the missing TARDIS.   But, it would also mean she has super-strength and can regenerate, which doesn't fit what we know of River.

Firstly, 1100 Doctor is not dead. It was a set up for him to carry out his plans a) without being distracted by River et al and b) knowing part of those plans involved his friends truly believing he is dead. To back this up we have Old Man Canton. Why was he even there? To bring the gas, sure, but this could've been done by one of the others. The Doctor has requested weirder things of his companions before. OM Canton just seems superfluous here.   
Also, Cantons lines ""That is most certainly the Doctor and he is most certainly dead."" Ill give him the first one; who wouldn't? But the second? I don't buy it. How would Canton, just a regular human with (maybe) minimal contact with the Doctor (now 1100, so with a few more tricks one would think) know through sight alone that the Doctor was ""certainly dead""?  
Then theres the question, where is his TARDIS? Yes, if he knew he was going to his death, he would've hidden it somewhere nice and safe. Or, if he was planning a set up, he would've had it nice and close - under the water, perhaps. A conveniently placed boat (with a possible hypnotic alien telling Rory to ""do it properly"") would see the Doctor on the water with a screen of flames to jump off the boat and into the waiting blue box.  
  
Prediction 2: I mentioned 1100s plans. Obviously, its the getting-rid-of of The Silence. Which aren't the aliens introduced here. A distraction for his companions - so that any watching actual Silence would not be too concerned about being stopped (plus it keeps them busy too) - from a race that owed him a favour, perhaps, so that he can get on with the *real* plan, which we have yet to see any of.  
Evidence: Only one bit right now and that is the fish people from Vampires of Venice. They looked through the cracks and saw The Silence. And they remembered how? The fishies saw the *real* Silence and ran like all fuck.  
  
And finally, and this is my favourite one, its a fake Silence in the suit. The arm raise gave this away for me.  
  
That's basically what I came up with. I've ignored the child/Amy's maybe pregnancy for now. But these three predictions dont really affect either anyway. Go nuts, blow me out of the water.

okay, so the silence have been on earth forever and influencing human progress to fit their needs. they have some sort of tardis like ship so isn't it perfectly reasonable to assume that the silence may have had a hand in influencing the timelords to create the tardis to fit the needs of the silence? the spacesuit did have alien tech in it which potentially means the silence have been influencing other alien progress as well to suit whatever need it is that is their final goal. we know they made the tardis blow up to create the cracks in the universe but since the silence don't really do things for themselves and prefer to influence others to complete their goals the question has to be who did they get to blow up the tardis? (my guess is river.. she was in there when it happened afterall) and now onto the whole ""silence will fall"" bit... what if that doesn't have anything remotely to do with their demise on earth? what if that has to do with what their final goal is and part of that requires getting the timelords out of the way since they could have potentially been the ones to influence davros into creating the daleks and setting into motion the whole time war itself? they could have also engineered the plan that lead to the events involving putting the doctor into the pandorica so whatever their goal is, and whatever ""silence will fall"" means (i'm guessing it's not a collapse like the fall of the roman empire but rather something like silence will fall across the universe, enveloping it) there is something about the timelords that they fear.

all this leads me to is that the silence are some sort of extension/foot soldier to the guardians of time, specifically the black guardian. i got to thinking what could possibly exist in the doctor who universe that they would have no effect on and the only thing that makes sense are the guardians. think of it like this... the cracks erased everything that fell into it from existence. what else had the ability to do that? the guardians so if anyone knew how to create the cracks that did that it'd be them. the silence can influence others by planting thoughts in their heads whereas the guardians also could influence others and could have given the silence the ability to do so... now back to silence will fall... what if that means bringing the entire universe into the void? the very same void that the black guardian was thrown into... the void where nothing exists except nothingness?

i hope that makes some sense. probably not.

tl;dr - if moffat is doing what i think he's doing we got a story arc that won't be completed for atleast another year and a half since you couldn't wrap up stuff involving the guardians in a 2 or 3 part episode.

I know the 'last kiss' moment was sad, but I don't think that's where it ends.  Possibly other have already thought of this, but remember in Silence in the Library when she describes the 'last time she saw [him]'.  He showed up at her doorstep with a fresh haircut and took her on a nice date.  Note that the 'old doctor' in 6.01 has a haircut.  I think part of his ""running away"" from his own death was to reach some sort of closure with River by saying goodbye properly.

As a matter of fact, the meeting was probably sadder for him than it was for her.  He knew that the next time she saw him he wouldn't know her and she would die.

That's an awfully long time to be pregnant without even showing. The Doctor made a comment about how she had gained weight. Maybe the baby gestated for an unusually long time while she traveled with The Doctor, and she was just starting to show as The Impossible Astronaut was beginning.

She feared that the TARDIS had manipulated the pregnancy somehow. The ""time head"" joke was a little forced. Arthur Darvill said that there is a line of dialogue in that episode that seemed a little odd, but turned out to be crucial later.

She seemed unsure about whether she had ever actually been pregnant or not. It's possible that she had her baby during the three months everybody spent on the run, looking for evidence of the Silents.

The memories of anybody who has been around The Silents are suspect, because the Silents can plant post-hypnotic suggestion. It's possible that all three were captured, Amy had her weird time head baby, even spent some time with it in a nursery and had her picture taken, and then all three were let go with their heads full of whatever The Silents wanted them to remember.

The Silents have a makeshift TARDIS that may or may not actually be usable. It's possible that through some kind of time travel, the little girl could be whatever age the writers want her to be at whatever time. It is also possible that she regenerated into her current form. She seems to be aware that she can do it, so she may have done it before.

So, there are some strong clues (I haven't even mentioned the hair color!) that the child could be Amy's. There are no indications that the child is River, though, and really, that would be kind of stupid. 

There is also an off-chance that the child is a captured Time Lord/Lady, forced to regenerate into a vulnerable form so that The Silents can make him/her help them build a TARDIS... possibly Omega?

She's Amy's child obviously we're supposed to assume that.  But traveling in the TARDIS places it in a type of flux, which is why the TARDIS couldn't decide if she was pregnant or not, and why it seems she never appears to be pregnant in all the photos from filming. The fetus in flux has absorbed residual energy from the TARDIS including from when the master regenerated inside the TARDIS.  So she's going to be like a ""Master's Daughter"" type thing or The Master his/her self, or version of but would still register as human per what River said regarding the suit.
OR
a 2nd theory could be that it is in fact River, but she was limited to the # of regenerations she had, plus she's a time anomaly more so then we've assumed.  Plus if she has absorbed residual energy from the TARDIS, who better to teach her how to fly it, then the TARDIS itself, as the girl already seems to have a decent amount of knowledge, which could have been absorbed from the TARDIS itself.
However saying that, I don't think its River in the suit that kills The Doctor.  I realize people guess it is and that's what puts her in prison, BUT the only people that saw it happen, have no knowledge that its her.  So how could that murder, in 2011, put in her prison in the 52nd century?

MINE:

1. The child is River and the Doctor's baby. The their time goes in opposite directions so when it gets to the point for the child's birth she knows she can not meet with the doctor again without messing something up. She leaves the newborn at the orphanage either knowing or making sure that the doctor will return there soon after leaving it in his care. This would explain possibly why Amy would be in a picture if someone took one when she held the child for the first time.


2. The Doctor and Amy are having a baby together. I don't know if it would be the normal way or if maybe the Tardis does something to cause it in a female passenger if so much time passes where there is only one timelord left. I could see something befalling the group causing the birth at the orphanage and it did appear the Silence did have a time machine so maybe it was used to somehow steal the child explaining how they kidnapped it from the doctor for so long.

MY FRIEND'S: *I can't give it fair explanation he just gave a quick over view of what he thought*

She should be out of the loop with that arc for the rest of the series.  So it'll be interesting to me if she stays involved or not.  

Also I noticed that she and the 1100 year old doctor meet, which is probably the oldest both of them have been while meeting.  You'd think with such a tragic love story, they'd have jumped on the chance to both be in love at the same time instead of just letting it go by.

It would explain when he speaks to the space suit, (I know it's you), seems so familar, he's speaking to River.

Now granted, we know River knows how to fly the Tardis and has a sonic screw driver, I'm assuming she is a timelord herself and therefore re-generates when she dies. She also says, to the doctor and the end of episode 2, ""i made a promise"". She promised the doctor that she would stay in the storm cage. She could break out any time she wanted anyway. 

What i think is still unanswered is why she killed the doctor? (possibly under the influence of the silence) 
What connection does Amy have in all this and why?

Two questions that need answering and i have a sneaking suspicion that re-watching series 1, may give us more information. There's a long way to go yet.

Moffat loves these, as he has made jokes of them, such as Amelia being thirsty because the Doctor stole her drink, because she was thirsty, etc.  He has used them in Time Crash where the only way 10 knows the solution to the problem is because he was 5 and saw himself do it. Moffat gets a kick out of these apparently and integrates them into the story in very interesting ways, and even averts them, such as the Doctor already having a pamphlet in his own writing to give young Amelia, but writing a new one to go back and give to Amelia. I realized with the 6x02 though that we have an even bigger one that stretches much further.

Aspects of the Doctor's relationship with River seems to be heading this way in many respects. In 6x02, River kisses the Doctor goodbye, and he is surprised, it having been the first time for him. Odds are though, he is going to continue this behavior only because she initiated it, because she was already used to him doing it. I imagine that eventually, he is going to kiss her and it will be the first time for her, as he just assumed it was their normal thing.  

At some point as well, the Doctor's knowledge of River will surpass her knowledge of him, and he will probably copy a word he has heard her say over and over [""Spoilers!""](/spoiler) When he starts doing this, she will essentially get the idea from him to say that, even though he is only saying it because he got the idea from her.  

I'm frankly loving this sort of playing around with these paradoxes.  I wonder though what everyone else thinks. Are you enjoying this as much as I am?

* **More Coalitions**

Yes, there would be more coalitions, but this is not a bad thing.  By having to please other parties to get majorities on votes, the more extreme policies would be filtered out or watered down.  As such, we would see less of the flagrant overspending under labour followed by massive cuts under conservatives, which would benefit, and better represent the country as a whole.

* **3 Countries**

Just because it is used by few countries doesn't make it a bad system. And as mentioned by [LordScarab](http://www.reddit.com/r/democracy/comments/h1hf4/look_at_this_bullshit_antialternative_vote/c1rxnuq), Australians are actually rather happy with AV. Just as people in the UK complain about the NHS but do not want rid of it.

* **Third place candidates winning**

This isn't third place, it is second, third, fourth, etc. choice of people whose original choice *cannot* get into power.  What it means is, if you prefer greens, then UKIP, then liberals, then labour, at each stage of polling, if your first preference is knocked out your next gets your vote.

In doing this, rather than ignoring all those who vote for minority parties, when they are 'knocked out' of the election race they can put forward their preference of who is left.

Think about it this way: Everyone gets to choose the party they want that has the option of a majority.  If you support Greens, at the start you support them just as a conservative would the Cons. In the next round, if Greens didn't get enough votes, you can support your next preference, and the conservative will *again* support the conservatives.  This continues until enough of the country support one party through a process of elimination.

So if 60% of the country are Liberal but spread over 5 parties, rather than the 40% support for the single conservative party winning, the liberal party most supported will win. This better represents the electorate.

* **£250m**

On a national level this is a drop in the ocean that will provide a much fairer and balanced electoral system. It is also a one off expense that will provide benefits into the future.

* **Their 5th preference = Your 1st preference**

No, because if there is 5 rounds through which your preference has remained, your first preference, in essence, is the same as your second, third, fourth and fifth. As explained earlier, you are given the choice out of all possible winners, with one eliminated from the running in each round and a count of votes taken again. This produces a better representation of the electorate as a whole.

* **BNP decides who wins**

If this were such a benefit to the BNP, why would they be a part of the NO campaign?  In a democracy, and this is a hard pill to swallow, if a lot of people support the racists, nazis, crazies, etc. then they should be adequately represented.  Who is anyone else to say otherwise? No one has the right to say what can and cannot be acceptable without undermining democracy.  Further to this, if a policy in parliament is so tightly divided down the middle that one or two votes will swing it either way, it clearly isn't representative of a substantial majority of the population and can wait until a better majority is voted in.  With FPTP, a party with 40% of the vote can pass any legislation they want, even if only 40% of the population want it. Under AV (as well as more proportionally representative systems) with coalitions in parliament and more accommodating policies to win votes, a larger chunk of the electorate will approve of the policies passed.

If a policy needs to be changed to accommodate the other members of a parliament to get support, then it doesn't satisfy the public's view. As representatives of the electorate, if they are not happy, the people are not happy.  Compromise is good. It stifles extremism and allows radical change only when agreed upon.

Parties like the BNP also have a lot of the support they do through protest votes that are designed to express displeasure with the current leading parties. If your votes for more minority parties can be better represented, the need to protest or tactically vote is vastly reduced.

Concerns:

- How do I go about finding a place to stay in a new city?
- Can I afford by myself, or will I need to find a flatmate,  
- and how do you even find a flatmate if needed?
- How much would I be looking to rent for in London, and how does it compare to other cities?
- Would it even be better to buy a house, rather than rent?
- Internships seem to offer £1k a month, how comfortable is that living-wise?
- Seems stupid, but how do you even go about making friends in a new city?

As someone who grew up on the old school series, I would love for some of the originals to show off their Doctors.  When they did the Five Doctors, I was fine with a replacement actor, as I thought he represented the first doctor well.  Pertwee and Troughton both have offspring, with Pertwee's son highly recognizable as a Third Doctor stand in (dead on same eyes and nose).  I'd especially love if some of the past companions could come back as well.  Missing the Brig and SJS would seem like it would be missing a hole.  The two original Masters would be ideal, but alas they each had passed as well.  Many of the old series companions have held up pretty well and could reprise rolls (I'm looking at you Lalla Ward)

My idea special, would be 11 Doctors and 2 Romanas, vs 3 Masters and maybe a Rani (with replacement actors or digital fx), but if we could get a Seven Doctors vs Silents and Angels, I think that would blow us all away as well.

Thoughts, suggestions?

Firstly, theres Amy's pregnancy. Just for stories sake, I'm going to say its more likely that she IS pregnant, than that she isn't. Its not a very good argument, but lets call it as assumption. 

So, there is one shot in DotM, where she sees a picture of herself with the little girl. That MIGHT be a clue that she is the little girl's mother. Frankly, that seems a little hard to believe, simply because i doubt Steven Moffet would do something so blatantly obvious. But if it is her daughter, that might also explain why she was taken by the Silence and her daughter let go. Whatever they wanted, may have been available in a 'purer' from from Amy herself. 

I also think its more likely that if it were her daughter, it would be Amy's daughter with the Doctor rather than Rory. If that were the case, that would explain why the doctor had to die. The little girl could be dying and using the suit to stay alive. River mentions its a full life support system, so maybe the fact that shes the child of a Time Lord and a human could mean she needs life support to stay alive. 

If that were the case, she could be close to dying and needed to regenerate to survive. Being only half time lord, that might not be possible. So the doctor had to be killed, to start a regeneration cycle. When the cycle started, she would absorb the energy and regenerate. And since its Amy's daughter ( more so that his own I'd feel ), the doctor is willing to die to save her. 

Thats just my theory. But honestly, its so superficial, that might be exactly what Moffett wants us to think till the end of the season before he brilliantly pulls the rug from under our feet again!

I think Amy is unwittingly the source for all of the Silence's information on the doctor somehow, and is key o the Silence's plan.**

First here are some things from season 5 I caught after watching the season 6 two parter.


**The 11th Hour**: Prisoner Zero knows about the Pandorica and the silence. The phrase ""The Pandorica will open"" is bait.  What I now take from this is that **a plan is already in motion against the doctor** and has been for some time. There is a very real possibility that it was no accident that prisoner zero waited with Amy while she waited for the doctor, he even mentions it later, and whose to say it was done willingly. What would a convict do with that information? River said empires would burn the planet for a timelord body. 

**Beast Below**: What is the best bait in a trap for the doctor? A child, a lonely scared child. This episode, to me, gives hints about the true purpose of 11th hour with all the talk of old creatures showing pity on the young. That's him and Amy in the previous episode. They knew he would return to her. She is the first bait in the trap. 

**Time of Angels/Flesh and Stone**: at the end the doctor goes off on how everything is about Amy, something I think that has more significance than we think.

**VoV**: Does The Fish Lady's statement insinuate that they saw The Silence creatures now? ""Through the cracks we saw Silence and the end of all things"". If the universe is cracked could the Silence come through them from outside our universe and then cause the explosion that lets them through after the fact?

**Amy's Choice**: This is the big one. This is the answer to the big question. **This episode is how the Silence knew how to blow up the Tardis**. The reason they dreamed was some kind of psychic pollen, and we know the Silence are somewhat psychic. The Doctor defeats the Dreamlord by **blowing up the Tardis** in his mind. It so obvious it hurts, but we still dont know how they physically did it, but this has to be where they learned how. Oh and by the way could this be the first real mention of the Amy pregnant saga if this does turn out to be a Silence influenced episode now?


**Pandorica Opens**: Vincent is being inflicted by visions that tell him to make a painting called ""The Pandorica Opens"" saying where to go. His episode was about seeing things that others can't, sound like something you know? Do you really think the alliance are responsible for Vincents visions and the trap that ends the universe, or were his visions creatures telling him to paint that painting and thats why he killed himself b/c he thought he helped kill the doctor?  Also, ""An alliance, how is that possible?"" what if it wasn't possible until they had it ""suggested"" to them doctor?

**Big Bang**: Why does Amelia still hear voices through the crack in her wall, there is literally no other place in the universe for it to go. Does this mean it reaches outside our universe.



**In summary**:
I think Amy isn't all she seems and not even she knows it. What made me go down this line of thinking was of course eye patch lady in Day of the Moon, and the fact that she is always at the center of things involving the silence. I think the silence invaded the entire universe, and made all the who villains team up against him simply to keep him away from his Tardis long enough to destroy it after they learned how in Amy's Choice, they don't do things themselves remember? I also think there is a possibility that destroying the universe and rebooting it are somehow linked to how they have been around so long, meaning their long infiltration is because of the reboot of the universe. They also knew the doctor was the only thing that could stop them because every alien species they encountered during the initial invasion that's hostile or a potential threat has the doctor as their #1 enemy. Now where do we stand post IA and DotM? Earth and the subsequent human civilizations are possibly the only safe, non-infiltrated worlds in the universe post earth year 1969, and there's still that to do with the fact that they are trying to make Tardises and Time Lords. I have a feeling we are about to hear an old familiar few words: Rassilon Imprimatur.

I think to make it easier to answer we have to first decide our budget and which players are absolute starting eleven material.  For the budget, I think the record shows that John Henry will spend big for world class young talent.  So i'll quote a starting budget of 60 million pounds.  For players going out, i'd list the following: Aqualani(14m), Poulsen(2m), Cole(4m), Konchesky(1m), Aurelio(2m), Jovanovic(4m) and N'Gog(3.5m).  

That leaves a budget of 80.5m pounds.  :)

As for which players are absolute starting eleven material, thats:
Reina, Johnson, Agger, Gerrard, Suarez.  Thats it, those are the only five i would consider undroppable.  

Next, we rank the positions according to starting strength.  While it'd be nice to buy 6 world class players to supplement those five, its unrealistic for a number of reasons.  So heres my ranking of the remaining positions, leaving out GK, RB, DC, RM(where i would play Gerrard) and ST(supporting):
AM(Meireles),LB(Johnson, Kelly at RB), DM(Lucas), ST(Carroll), CB(Skrtel), LM(? don't really have a LM, Gerrard and Carroll have taken the positions where Kuyt would start, RM and ST)

Of these, I would say Meireles, Carroll, Kelly and Lucas are of the quality needed for the starting XI. So at minimum, we need a LM and a CB for next season.  Of course there are many different types of players that could fill these holes. 

Ideally, I like to see a ball playing defender and a hardass tackler as partners in the middle of the defense.  Agger has had some injury problems as of late and we don't really have another ball playing defender, unlike the other role, which both Carra and Skrtel can fill.  So i'd like to go out and sign an all-round world class defender.  For me, this player is Mamadou Sakho.  21 years old, best centerback in Ligue 1 and probably the best CB for the french national team. Scores goals, kicks ass, and is big and strong.  I'll mark him down at 20 million pounds.  

For the left side of our midfield, I want a fast as fuck trickster with a killer end ball and moves that will fill the local hospitals with victims.  Mata would be my first choice, but i don't think thats very realistic, so i'll ""settle"" for Eden Hazard.  Anyone who knows anything about European football knows the name.  The only thing that makes me wary is his youth and supposed attitude issues last year, but from what i've heard he's been much better this season.  Ticks all the boxes.  Could be the best player in the world in a few years.  I'll mark him down at 30 million pounds.

So thats the main two positions filled.  30.5 million left.  Little bit uncertain what to do with the rest of that.  Will think about it and post again tomorrow.",false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,null,null,self,Starting XI next season?,6,http://www.reddit.com/r/LiverpoolFC/comments/h2zl8/starting_xi_next_season/

The Doctor always runs from things.   He didn’t tell Rose he loved her when he could have.   He ran from the four knocks.  He ran from Jack when he became a fixed point in time. That is what he does.   

He said in Day of the Moon that the little girl would find them.   In The Impossible Astronaut, he said he’s been running from something for a long time and it was time to stop.   And promptly gets shot.   

So it’s a good bet that he is running from the Girl.   He must sense that something is up with her and doesn’t want to deal with it..

THE BULK OF IT:


I find myself often staring for hours on end at images, pictures of far away places; idyllic countryside or mountainside, lakeside - wherever, often just the outside; to vomit out a cliché *'the grass is always greener on the other side'* - but in this situation it's literal. Rolling hills &amp; pastures full of life beat tarmacked sludge and concrete, it doesn't make me a hippy for figuring that out.


The city is . . . the city is chaos, thousands of people rushing to-and-fro, their destination isn't of any interest to me, but why are they so hurried all the time?! There's no appreciation of personal space, or notion of what's fair. As a collective, we're selfish, and it's sickening.


There must be something about people, once we gather and reach that critical mass, sometime above village perhaps, we become insects. Our goals change, no longer does the community or our relationship with anyone we're not familiar with matter, after all: why put myself out-of-pocket just to help some stranger, when they're more than likely never to even see me again, never mind repay the favour?


I think it's for this reason that I want to escape. This is home, I shouldn't refer to leaving it as 'escape', yet I do. The people, oh! The cramped and crowded streets agitate me so much. There are of course sanctuaries of solitude found here and there, more there than here, but they're there, none-the-less, and that counts for something. I think I'd have left Liverpool's embrace had it not been for her parks, her architecture . . . all of my writing, and most of my thinking has been done at such oases, and for that I'm thankful.


But I need more, I can't cope here, I want to scream in the faces of ever passerby who barges passed me, let them know that if they were to slow down their breathing, put thought to their steps, take the sodding time to notice the beautiful architecture &amp;amp; goings-on around them, they'd feel a lot less stressed and in doing so not be so fecking agitating to have around.


They're Legion, for they are many: a moving entity of solid depression, a vile detractor of happiness plaguing our streets. Energy vampires sucking the joy out of everyones day, **just stop snarling at strangers!**


I understand entirely how this may be considered highly hypocritical, how I'm being negative in writing it, but I've reached breaking-point and it needs to be said.

I know that, but I do need to get this off my chest. There will be spoilers regarding The Impossible Astronaut and Day of The Moon, so if you haven't seen the first two episodes, please do that. (They *are* great episodes)



Okay, so my problem lies with the Silence. Most importantly how the Doctor handled them at the end of DOTM. I understand that the Silence most likely have a lot more going on than we currently know, but my problem is regarding what we already know. 

What we know:
- The Silence have been on Earth for thousands of years, if not longer.
- The Silence played a major role in the development of the space program in the 60's
- They did this so they could procure a space suit
- They probably know more about the little girl than anyone else

What I'm having a hard time understanding is what the *direct threat* to the human race was that the Silence were posing. In the entirety of the two episodes, we only see The Silence harm one person, in the White House. Other than that, their plan seems fairly harmless (again, this is only based on what we know). It seems to me like the only thing The Silence are guilty of is aiding the development of our species.

They say that they were here since ""fire, and the wheel"". If this is implying that they were the ones to give those developments to us, shouldn't we be thanking them? Two things that have directly contributed to the onset of civilized society were given to us by alien visitors. It doesn't seem like something dastardly, or devious. 

Then, thousands of years later, they are the impetus for the human race's first baby steps into the greater Universe around us. And all they asked in return was one spacesuit? It doesn't seem like too much to ask for.

But this is all leading to my real problem. The thing that has been causing me almost a Whovian spiritual crisis. I love The Doctor. I think he is one of the best, and most honorable characters ever created. But in this situation, in which he assumedly knows just as little as we, the viewers, do, and his first strike is to doom The Silence to generations of execution. 

The Doctor (again, assumedly) has no idea what The Silence are after, and even if they pose a direct threat to the human race. He doesn't seem to make much of an effort to question, or interrogate, or investigate. He is confronted with something mysterious and intimidating, and reacts in much the way we would expect humans to react (at least the way humans are portrayed in the Whoniverse), with quick, and uninformed violence.

Now, whenever I've brought these issues up with my Whovian friend, she is steadfast in her insistence that The Silence deserved it, because they had enslaved humanity. But did they? The Silence are the ones who lived underground. Whenever we see them, they're crowded together, hunched over in dark caves and abandoned buildings. Humans aren't in chains. We live on the surface, oblivious, and only are contacted by the Silence when they are giving us technology or pointing us in a certain direction.

The Silence were not threatening the course of human history. They are A PART of it. They didn't wish to destroy it, but were pivotal in making it happen. And The Doctor sentenced them, and their children (assuming they breed) to death. This isn't the Doctor I know. The Doctor I know would have made a better effort to understand what was going on. He wouldn't have jumped at the chance to kill unless he knew that doing so would save millions. And I just can't get past it.

I know that many of you may downvote this, because of my questioning the Doctor. But that isn't what my Doctor would want, either. Humanity is unique in its ability to question the ones we idolize. I don't love him any less, I just want to know more. I want to know if his actions *did* save us, or if he slaughtered a species because he was scared.

So downvote me if you must. Hell, maybe I deserve it.

This will allow a somewhat separate discussion, allowing for a separate place to discuss Doctor Who without worrying about tagging for spoilers.

This is not my idea--someone suggested it a week ago but I couldn't find the thread, so can't give credit where credit is due.

And then Saturday, my Great Uncle. One of the greatest men I have ever known, passed away at the age of 81. He had been a merchant marine, served the US ARMY, and has been to places I may never see.  Through all of this, I have not shed a tear, and instead have been a source of strength and support for my family. After watching that video, and seeing every regeneration of the Doctor, I finally let it out, I have not simply cried like that in a long time. and I needed it. Badly.

Doctor Who touches a place in my heart that no other show or bit of entertainment can touch. It appeals to my sense of freedom, of love. For lack of a better phrase, the Doctor represents EXACTLY what I try to be in a man. A man of stern beliefs in his companions. A man of fairness, but unwavering standards. A man who cannot see a wrong and not try to turn it around. Each regeneration that happened in the video reminded me:

On Sunday, May 1, 2011, my partner was sexually assaulted outside The Eldon Pub on Woodhouse Lane in Leeds. The prominent blond haired man featured in the above video is wanted in relation to this crime. He was white, aged 25 to 40, about 5ft 7ins tall and stocky, with short blond hair and a round face. He was with a group of men who hinted that they had travelled from Durham and spoke with a Northern (possible Geordie) accent.

If anyone recognises this man or can provide any help whatsoever in tracing him, please PM us with details. Alternatively, you can contact Crimestoppers (anonymously) on 0800 555 111.

Just in case there is any doubt of authenticity, [here is a related newspaper article](http://www.yorkshireeveningpost.co.uk/news/latest-news/woman_sexually_assaulted_outside_leeds_pub_1_3342715). I am a long-time Redditor (5 years and counting!), but I hope you appreciate my partner's request to retain my anonymity. We would also both massively appreciate you forwarding the video to anyone you know.
Thank you so much (from both of us) for any help that you can possible provide.

UPDATE:
My girlfriend and I have just logged on, expecting at most to see a few helpful comments. We were however genuinely astounded to find *so* much help and kindness shown from *so* many people. She's promised never again to mock me for the amount of time I spend on Reddit :)
I'm a little concerned that it may cause issues further down the line if I was to further discuss the fine details of this case online, and with having no experience whatsoever in this area (thankfully), I'd like to err on the side of caution for now.

By this, I mean; what if the little girl time lord eventually found a chameleon arch of some kind, and decided to regenerate into an even younger child, used the arch, and grew up to be Amy, in an attempt to hide from the Silence?

Thus, the reason that Amy is Pregnant/Not Pregnant is because her timeline has been so messed up that reality itself can no longer tell whether she is actually human enough to give birth to a human child. It also sort of explains how Amy can be so naturally like herself, and how she got such a perfect fairy-tale name.

As an extra bonus crazy theory, I'm also half-convinced that the Doctor is thus her father, and River her mother, but it doesn't quite work. It works on the Doctor's side, definitely, but River doesn't accidentally fall into place the same way.

Also, other than the fact that this idea raises more questions than answers, I don't get the impression that the chameleon arch will be used again, and this is a very convoluted use.

I was born in the late 1970's, in a not-quite-rural-but-far-from-urban region of the American South. My parents were a retired schoolteacher and an ordained Episcopal minister, which made for... let's say an ""*interesting*"" atmosphere.

Because of my mother's strong predilection for education, my television viewing was carefully monitored, and once I reached elementary school, much of my recreational TV privileges were almost completely revoked. [Toyetic](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toyetic) shows were dramatically scaled back, and anything approaching realistic violence (like GI Joe) was banned outright. However, I found a neat little loophole.

In the early '80s, small PBS (for those overseas, PBS is Public Broadcasting System, a donation-run, commercial-free affiliate network with a heavy emphasis on education and culture) affiliates would frequently use recycled BBC content to fill out their schedules, and it was to my delight that I discovered Doctor Who on our local PBS affiliate. As it happened, the specific syndication package seemed to run from season 16 (The Key to Time) through season 18 (the Entropy arc, ending with Logopolis), which they repeated several times. I was allowed to watch all of it.

In real life, unhappy stormclouds gathered. Although an Episcopal minister, my father was never a very spiritual man. He was never physically abusive, but was paranoid, manipulative, vulgar, and insulting, frequently telling my siblings and me that we were stupid, incapable of achieving anything, and that our very existence was an unfair burden on him.

When I was five, he filed for divorce, but retained visitation rights. My siblings and I dreaded these visits, as they were nothing more than weekend-long guilt fests, during which he would continually shower his new stepchildren with affection and attention, and do everything legally within his power to make us completely miserable.

Eventually, he got bored with these visits. He bargained with my mother, complaining that the child support payments were too high. She countered that he could keep his money if he simply gave up visitation rights. He cheerfully accepted.

I was unfortunate enough to have heard that conversation firsthand, at the age of six.

When I was seven, my mother eventually remarried, this time to an eccentric - but well respected - professional in our small town. During their courtship, he was a regular teddy bear. After their marriage, he became a grizzly.

He viewed my siblings and me as a ready source of cheap labor, and would consistently put us to work on heavy construction projects: Pouring concrete, shoveling gravel, digging forms for building foundations. On one occasion, he put me to such heavy labor in 100°+ weather that I passed out from heatstroke - after which, he actually *bragged* about the fact. On another occasion, he pointed a loaded gun at me, telling me that I wasn't working hard enough, and saying ""I know a way to motivate you."" On a further occasion, he pointed a loaded weapon at my brother, *in front of my mother*, and told her to choose between having a son and having a husband.

He constantly threatened to kill us, both individually and together as a group. He casually talked about burning the house down with us all in it, and detailed exactly how he would get away with it. Because of his job, he worked closely with local law enforcement. We had every reason to believe that he could do what he said, and that there would never be anything more than a cursory investigation.

All through this time, my enthusiasm for Doctor Who remained. The Doctor was always kind and friendly, especially to children. He was rarely harsh, and *never* cruel, not even to his worst enemies. He had an insatiable wonder and curiosity for the entire universe, and valued both knowledge and wisdom in equal regard.

Though others in similar circumstances might have turned to religion to ease some of the suffering, my family was already painfully aware that prayer alone did nothing, and to make matters worse, many within our church community already knew exactly what was going on - and did nothing about it. A conspiracy of silence swept across our town. Those who didn't know my stepfather saw him as a wonderful jack-of-all-trades, and spoke highly of him. Those who truly knew him said (and did) nothing.

I can only speculate where I would be now without the values I saw in the fictional character of the Doctor. I've heard reports of others suffering through similar situations, and of them choosing to run away, or end their own lives, or even murder their tormentor.

I won't be so maudlin as to say that ""Doctor Who saved my life,"" or ""Without the Doctor, I would be a killer,"" but I will say that it helped. In times when I was nearest the tipping point, the Doctor helped calm me and bring me back. When then environment intended to comfort and nurture me instead threatened and bullied me, the Doctor provided escape. And when I had no tangible role model to look up to, the Doctor filled that role, fueling a passion for understanding - both to understand the world around me, and to understand myself.

I just felt a need to get that off my chest. I am now a father myself, and have a job I enjoy doing. I'm well liked, both by those in my social circle, and by other professionals within my industry.

TL;DR - Kid in desperate situation gloms onto fictional character for moral support. It helps.

1.  In the impossible astronaut, Nixon says to Canton on the phone that he is his 2nd choice for the job. Who would be his first choice? Or was this just a set up for Canton's 2nd choice for president line?

2.  When River is shooting all the Silents at the end she says something along the lines of ""I wouldn't want my old man to see me doing that"" and then turns around and Rory is there. Is that supposed to mean her husband (Unknown/The Doctor?) or her Father (Unknown/Rory?) If its even relevant, its probably meant to be ambiguous. 
On a side note: River also shoots a silent that is behind her so she wouldn't know it was there. Maybe she heard it I guess but that means it wasn't very silent! HA

3.  This one is probably just a coincidence and not relevant but exactly nine months pass from when Amy first tells The Doctor she is pregnant to when the little girl regenerates. 

4.  I assumed that the shadowy figures behind the statues in The Big Bang were gonna be the silence, but that doesn't really add up any more now we know them. What do you think they could be?

I've still not fully made my mind up about **Day of the Moon**, but it certainly chucked some mindfuck material into the mix.

So, what do we have? The main points:

The Silence, who have always been here.

A time machine, which we've seen before.

A female child of dubious origin and probably the ability to regenerate.

A dead Doctor and a live one.

So, what does it all mean? Obviously it is too early in the season to even *know most of the questions*, never mind have any real answers, but I thought it would be fun to play around with some ideas. First, I want to revisit last season, and it's main unanswered questions.

Who blew up the TARDIS? Why? How?

River pointed out the burn marks in the grass outside Amelia's house - burn marks made by something with three legs and a centre bit (just like the TARDIS-like machine from The Lodger), just before she went into Amelia's room and saw the evidence that the Pandorica was a trap, suggesting that whoever set the trap used that TARDIS-like machine (which we know The Silence had) to visit Amelia (or at least her house).

We also know that the whole trap was set up with Amy's mind/memories as a template to lure the Doctor (books on romans, pandora's box, etc in her room. What else was in the room? Figures Amelia made of the Doctor, but I'll come back to this).

So, who set the trap? Well, who sprung it? The Daleks, the Cybermen, the Sontarans, etc. Would they really manage to get together unaided? Did someone else instigate it?

Put it this way, we know Prisoner Zero knew about The Silence. As did the vampire/fish lady in Venice. So why didn't the Daleks, etc? The Silence were obviously throughout the Galaxy, or even the Universe, yet none of the Doctor's enemies at the end of the season seemed to know anything about them. Maybe they didn't know because The Silence used them to set the trap and then made them forget. So, if The Silence set the trap to imprison the Doctor in the Pandorica, were The Silence also behind the TARDIS blowing up? This is far from certain at this stage, and I may have my doubts.

Also: **Amy's Choice**. Don't forget **Amy's Choice**. Just a simple stand-alone episode? Am I the only one that doubts this? Setting up an alternate personality for the Doctor, for a one-off episode? A possibly evil one? Didn't Karen Gillan say that Moffat called this the most important episode of the season? We saw a reflection of the Doctor at the end, and he had the face of the Dreamlord. Maybe that side of him did not disappear so easily. Maybe the Dreamlord is still around in some way.

Anyway, back to the new season. 

What happened in the three months we don't see? What enabled them to remember The Silence between viewings? Nobody else in the history of humanity managed it, yet they all can remember the basics, if not the specifics. They know they are there, and they know they are in control of humanity. How did they manage this?

What happened when Amy shot the Astronaut/girl? Did she really miss? If so, why, the nest time she sees her, does her faceplate have a great big hole in it?

Who the hell was the ""No, I think she's just dreaming."" eyepatch woman?

How long was Amy really held by The Silence?

Why was there a picture of Amy holding a/the child?

""We are The Silence. The Silence will fall.""

The Silence will fall? Foreshadowing thier own end? Is this all part of the plan? Are The Silence meant to be killed? Could this actually explain some of the gaping holes in **Day of the Moon**? Where did NASA get the dwarf star alloy they used to seal the Doctor? Why did the Doctor dismiss the whole issue of the little girl at the end? Is this why the one in The Lodger didn't have a pilot?

WHY HASN'T THE WHOLE SEASON AIRED YET!

**DAMN YOU, MOFFAT!**

**""I've been running faster than I've ever run, and I've been running my whole life.""**

Also, just to add a final little mind-fuck. The Doctor and River, keep meeting in reverse order? Really? The kiss scene only works if this is true. The reveal by River to Rory about her pain would only work if this were so. Every time we've seen them, it certainly (seems) they are meeting in reverse order. So, why do they keep mentioning 'meeting out of order'? Why do they keep referencing thier diaries? If they are meeting in reverse order, then from River's point of view, the last time she met the Doctor is always the next time from his point of view. But, how can they ever have a diary entry that matches, then? Easter island? Jimmy the Fish? Surely, they would never have any matching memories of meeting, as all of River's past is in the Doctor's future, and vice versa? Mind-fuck, or just bad writing?

Last month we received reports from local organisations in Shan State, eastern Burma, telling us how the Burmese Army has been gang-raping women, torturing villagers, executing them, and firing mortar bombs into their villages. Many are taken as slaves to carry supplies for the Burmese Army.

With its fake election and release of Aung San Suu Kyi, the dictatorship is trying to fool the world into believing it has changed. But its actions speak louder than words.

The new attacks started when the dictatorship broke a ceasefire agreement with an armed ethnic political party, the Shan State Army – North. They had refused to join the Burmese Army, and so they were attacked. And as usual, the Burmese Army targeted civilians, raping, looting and killing.

What is happening in Burma is similar to what has happened in Libya and Syria – a brutal regime targeting civilians. But the response could not be more different. On Libya there is international action, on Syria there is international condemnation, but on Shan State, Burma, there is silence.

Help us break the silence, action is needed now!

Maybe a Hugh Laurie, Bill Nighy, Gary Oldman, hell Patrick Stewart said he'd love to take on the role (Christ, I think I might explode). 

I personally adhere to the theory that the Doctor regenerates into a personality that he needs to help him survive. At the end of the Last Great Time War, McGann (the romantic, in my mind) was facing a bleak/loner existence, so Eccleston (the headstrong, independent, sometimes solemn yet lighthearted) came along. He then needed a more adventurous, engaging demeanor to keep his wits about him, while he could still be a bit scatterbrained and prone to hit the sauce a time or two: Tennant. That got old and perhaps he needed a bit more whimsy and fairy tale style magic in his world to keep the universe together, thus Smith. 

My guess is next he may need someone with experience, wisdom, and therefore age.

More information about episode 4, The Doctor's Wife, from Doctor Who Magazine. I'm really looking forward to this episode, more so than the others.
quote:

    The Doctor: “Time Lord emergency messaging system. Like a flare pistol. In an emergency, we’d wrap up our thoughts in psychic containers and send them through time and space. OK, not like a flare pistol. Anyway there’s a living Time Lord still out there! And it’s one of the good ones!”
    Rory: “You said there weren’t any Time Lords left”
    Doctor: “There aren’t. No Time Lords left anywhere in the universe. But the universe isn’t where we’re going.”

    The TARDIS, drawn off course by the most unlikely distress signal, materialises outside of time and space itself. In this bubble universe, the Doctor meets Idris and her aunt and uncle, who live together in a scrapyard of impossible things. Idris, it seems, is mad. And when the Doctor finds out why she is the way she is, things start to get a bit complicated. And unmentionable.

        * This story will change the way we see a key part of series’ mythology
        * We see an infinite TARDIS corridor (pictured below)
        * Originally there was a “TARDIS hall of mirrors” that instead got replaced with an “Ood being really scary in the dark”
        * There was going to be a TARDIS swimming pool scene, but it was too expensive to film
        * The episode was originally going to have Rory trapped in the Zero Room


Old stuff:
quote:

    The Doctor receives a distress signal from an old friend. Could there really be another living Time Lord out there? Hopes raised, he follows the signal to a junkyard planet sitting upon a mysterious asteroid in a Bubble universe, populated by a very strange family, as the time-travelling drama continues.

    The Doctor, Amy and Rory are given the warmest of welcomes by Auntie, Uncle and Nephew. But the beautiful and insane Idris greets them in a more unusual fashion – what is she trying to tell the Doctor? As the Doctor investigates, he unwittingly puts his friends in the gravest danger.

        * The ball of yellow energy inside the old TARDIS happens in this episode
        * ""I've killed hundreds of Time Lords"" dialogue happens in this episode
        * Michael Sheen will be lending his voice.
        * Doctor says that somewhere nearby there are lots and lots of Time Lords.
        * The character of Idris “may be an old friend with a new face” and “a new take on a familiar character”
        * Episode has been described as one which hardcore fans will love. ""Mad and magical"" and ""funny and scary and exciting and heartbreaking"" and ""A real love letter to the fans"".
        * Idris is said to be the physical manifestation of the TARDIS
        * Idris is said to rival the Doctor's intelligence, and to be a bit insane.
        * I can't say very much actually because the whole gimmick behind that show - and it's a very clever gimmick - will be unveiled in the opening minutes,""
        * Die, Amy, die writing has been written across the TARDIS corridor walls. This may also be the scene from the trailer in which see Amy holding her stomach and crying out.


Some new details about episode 5 and 6, The Rebel Flesh and The Almost People from Doctor Who Magazine.
quote:

    Meet The Flesh. A shimmering pool of gelatinous white matter, threaded with veins like an eyeball. Step into the alcove, strap yourself into the harness, and the Flesh can take your form. You can control the cloned drone like a puppet, performing dangerous tasks without putting yourself in danger.

    That’s what’s happening in the monastery where the TARDIS crash-lands. And all things considered, it’s going pretty well. As long as the Flesh doesn’t start having ideas of its own…

    Doctor: “You poured in your personalities, emotions, traits, memories, secrets – everything. You gave them your lives. Human lives are amazing. Are you surprised they ran off with them?”

        * Described as Avatar meets The Thing
        * An old converted monastery is mining acid
        * The Flesh is programmable matter
        * There is a bad, scary monster at the end
        * The Flesh creatures are very scary
        * Amy has a secret
        * Rory is worried about losing Amy
        * These episodes are a pivotal part of this year’s story arc
        * Some whispered words in the second half of the story will have “mind-blowing significance”
        * Huge surprises, including the chance to hear “some voices from the past”
        * Ends on a massive cliffhanger that spin us off into the mid-series finale",false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,null,null,self,Doctor Who Spoilers (Episodes 4 - 6),16,http://www.reddit.com/r/doctorwho/comments/h4t35/doctor_who_spoilers_episodes_4_6/

Now, to me, the Silence do not seem like beings that would simply say you have been with them for a long time just to mess with you. Just how long was Amy with the Silence?

I have seen over and over that she is Rory &amp; Amy's daughter, but I am hear to tell you she is Ms. Amelia Pond.  Moneo's post [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/doctorwho/comments/h0x5x/official_discussion_day_of_the_moon/c1ru0tx?context=3) is where I originally saw this, but I have been obsessively think on this. The pregnancy is a red herring...Amy is the Doctor's daughter and the girl in the spacesuit.

Here is the proof I have so far:

-Amy is displaced in time.  (I know there was a whole bunch of proof for this throughout last series, including Rory's badge.)

-The Silent tell Amy that her memory is weak, meaning that she has forgotten her youth (or previous incarnations, or whatever you would call youth as a TL.)

-The Silent also tell Amy she is the one that brought them (the line is something along the lines of ""we do you an honor, you bring the silence"").  If she was a TL, she would be old enough to have brought them in the time of the 'fire and the wheel'.

-Something really fucking bad has to happen put the crack in time, and I think that is the Doctor hooking up with River, and producing Amy could be that.  DW likes to have consequences for the Doctor being happy, and I think the consequence to him having a child would be his lover being thrown backwards through time and his daughter being lost in time.  Or they could have hidden Amy in time based on River's comment about civilizations killing for a cell of Time Lord blood.  No matter how Amy gets placed back there, it is the creation of another at least part time lord that causes the crack.

-Why hadn't the spacesuit girl taken someone else to escape?  She had to have come in contact with at least the orphanage owner guy, so why hadn't she used him to escape?  Maybe she needed another TL (or TL-half-breed) to satisfy the needs of the suit.

-The spacesuit girl being Amy's daughter would be too easy.  Everyone and their mother on the internet is calling the kid Amy's daughter.  Rarely is the most obvious route the one this show takes.

-Who would the Doctor be willing to sacrifice himself for?  His daughter and companion?  We know he would.  Given that it wouldn't make him the last TL either, it would make the decision even easier.

-Why didn't the person in the spacesuit who killed the doctor just show themselves?  Because it had to have been one of the 4 people there.  That suit is custom built to keep a TL alive, I doubt it would support anyone but a TL.  We know Rory isn't a TL (he's plastic) and we know River isn't a TL (she dies) so that only leaves that FBI guy and Amy.

So, help me flush out my theory.  Tell me why spacesuit girl isn't Amy.  What haven't I explained away?

tl;dr I am convinced Amy is the spacesuit girl (both the girl who regenerates and the one who kills the Doctor.)",false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,null,null,self,My theory about the girl [SPOILERS],7,http://www.reddit.com/r/doctorwho/comments/h5x7x/my_theory_about_the_girl_spoilers/

What to call this religion?  Timelordian?  Galifrian (but that's from Galifry), Whovian (but that's a fan).  Suggestions.

We can also discuss the philosophy of the Church of the Doctor too.",false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,null,null,self,"Doctor Who is my Religion.  What should I call it?  ",1,http://www.reddit.com/r/doctorwho/comments/h64q2/doctor_who_is_my_religion_what_should_i_call_it/

Dear Phillip Lee,

I understand that you must be doubly thrilled by the electorate's unmitigated rejection of the alternative vote system last Thursday.

As a recent addition to the ranks of elected Conservative members of parliament I suspect you are strongly guided by the party line, but as a medical man you have more reason than most to be particularly excited by the result.

You see the No Campaign as I recall suggested that the money saved from maintaining the status quo would be used to fund 2000 new doctors and 8000 nurses, a huge shot in the arm for your own profession if you'll pardon the pun.

As my elected representative I am calling on you now to ensure these additional funds are redirected as promised, to keep the Government honest if you will. I would hate to think that the electorate was otherwise duped and that we are in fact governed by liars.

I kid, Actually. I think The Silence may Time Lords.

I mean it this time, The Silence are Time Lords.

When The Doctor locked the Time Lords away in the Time War, A large gap was left in reality, This gap was filled in by various garbage data that then formed The Silence.

Their anti-memetic properties could be a result of being built out of the noise of the universe, A typical human/alien mind will be able to register seeing them, But because of how they came into existence, Their brains/flesh-sacs/data-banks have trouble storing the memory of them.

The Tardis that they built is part of they're garbage makeup, They have some memories floating around of the Time Lords and have been compelled to build this Tardis like device.

The Silence are pretty much [MissingNo](http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Missingno.), Built upon garbage data and given a life.

No.

These men are from a pre-industrial society. The first likely question they will have is ""what is an engine?"".They won't know how to operate a computer, read the alien language the ships controls are in, maintain the life support systems, hell they won't even know that opening a window is a bad idea (until half the crew is splattered across space). 

Where will they get their food? They are trapped in an alternate universe where the only race we have seen has a physiology so radically different to our own that even the near-omnipotent super-advanced ship sick bay couldn't cure something as basic as a small cut. Any food reserves will be indigestible, if the aliens even eat at all.

Frankly the only good outcome for the pirates is if the link with our universe remains intact, in which case the pirates will turn that ship around, return to Earth and start jumping through mirrors to steal stuff. That would probably alter history quite a bit though, leaving the Doctor with a few headaches.

Also questionable in the episode is the seeming lack of medical equipment in the TARDIS. Despite having a built in pregnancy tester, a library and a swimming pool, the Doctor does not see fit to carry the stone-age (by his standards) technology required to resuscitate someone or cure typhoid.

Eyepatch Lady is Amy's midwife.  Because of the strange nature of Amy's temporal/multi-universe/whatever pregnancy, she's having brief flashes of her delivery.

In Day of the Moon, she says ""I think she's dreaming.""  I'm betting Amy's visions are a two way street.  The Amy *we* see is getting visions of her pregnancy, and the Amy that's giving birth gets visions of what *our* Amy is experiencing.

- This season will be split in two because they want it to line up with the final episode being released at Christmas, and because it's going to require a LOT of work.

So I spent four months at Oxford and came back at the end of April. While I was there, I frequented Taylor's (the one over on Woodstock especially) and their sandwich of the month for April was this cajun chicken thing. It tasted nothing like an American cajun anything but it was still delicious and I'm trying to figure out how to make it.

The main stumbling block is the chicken. They didn't use solid chicken pieces, but a kind of paste, probably minced chicken and mayo. I'm not sure what that is called so I can't look it up to see how it is made.

I have a new theory to propose. It was suggested to me by a friend who does not frequent Reddit, so I would like to share her thoughts.

Amy is pregnant, but not with spacesuit kid. Perhaps Amy is her grandmother! Amy gives birth to River Song. River Song marries Doctor Who and they have a child together-- spacesuit kid. 

Evidence? Of course, the picture in the orphanage, but also that we know that spacesuit kid has some time lord in her-- she regenerated at the end of episode 2. So, she may very likely be the Doctor's kid.

This is a fairly random thought but bear with me. So in Day of the Moon the Doctor managed to influence pretty much all of humanity through post-hypnotic suggestion. The command was 'kill us all on sight'. There's been a fair bit of uproar about this - people interpreting it as an act of genocide against the silence - a race we know precious little about. Other people saw it more as a threat; a way to make the silence run. I've now started thinking this could be the biggest mistake the Doctor ever made. 

The problem is that all the discussion has assumed that the command is straight forward and easy to understand, but it's not - there's a massive scope ambiguity: whom does ""us"" refer to. To the doctor and the viewer, who are well used to dealing with a variety of alien races, this seems obvious, ""us"" means the Silence. But what does it mean to a 1960s human whose never met an alien before? Does ""us"" mean ""the silence"" or does it mean ""aliens""? How are people meant to know the difference? Perhaps all aliens are the enemy. At the very least there might be problems with races who have a superficially similar appearance to the silence - the Ood for example don't look *that* different. Remember of course it's not the logical part of the brain processing the command and to a xenophobe one alien is much like another.

Essentially what I'm suggesting is that the Doctor may have commanded all humanity to murder every alien being they meet.

I don't really know where else to look for this, perhaps there is a subreddit for sourcing kids TV-related nostalgia? Anyway. Back in the day (1990s) I remember watching an animation that followed a toy soldier and a doll as they ventured around the house whilst the family slept. The most memorable part was when they climbed in to a painting of a stormy sea and found pirates yonder thar. (It was a one-off, embedded in another programme maybe?). 

This would serve as a huge nostalgic release if anybody can perhaps give a name or an indication as to where to find it.

Just wanted to show my appreciation for the really beautiful shots we're seeing in this new season. I love how they've been showing some of the huge, dramatic places on earth in the America episodes, and really highlighted how ""alien"" and impressive the planet is. One reason I've always loved DW is because it's always put our planet into perspective cosmically- whether that's races of sentient lizards far older than humans in the center of the earth, civilizations eons away on stars we'll never be able to visit, or the whole PLANET Barcelona.

Did anyone else feel like *The Impossible Astronaut* and *Day of the Moon* were finale-caliber episodes? I felt like Steven Moffat gave away all his good stuff right at the beginning. The kind of stuff that's usually built up over a whole series.

Then I had a look at the episode list and noticed that 6x13 is only **one** episode, penned by Moffat. That's a bit unusual, isn't it? I'm guessing it'll be like *The Eleventh Hour*: double length. I can't imagine coming back in September for 6 episodes, and having the finale be only one 40 minute episode... after what is probably going to be a major cliffhanger between June and September.

There are many missing 1st and 2nd Doctor Episodes.  What if the BBC created a reality show in which they gave at team of film school students the exact budget (in today's money) of the original missing episodes, and had them re-make them?  To keep it interesting, they could not use CGI as it didin't exist when the original shows aired, but while they would have to stick to the original script and characters, have total freedom of direction and editing.

I couldn't see, constantly bumping into things, nightmare itchiness and I looked like I'd been beaten in. My regular doctor missed it was viral, gave me antibiotics and anti bacterial eye drops which made the whole thing worse. So I decided to go to the eye hospital in Marylebone ( London ) 

Cut to four hours later I'm seen by this doctor who tells me there's nothing that can be done as it's viral, I'm just going to have to ride it out and prescribed me no treatment. Not really happy about this I just think "" OK, doctor knows best"" 

It got worse and worse to the point where I couldn't see at all so I thought "" fuck this"" and went to another eye hospital in Kingston ( Surrey ) for a second opinion. 

Another four or so hours and I walk out armed with a bunch of eye cremes and different eye drops, one week on and I'm a lot better. Non treatable... bullshit. FTR the doctor was pretty disgusted that I was given nothing by the other eye hospital. She said it was dangerous to leave it untreated, this is my sight for fucks sake.

In the interim my GF develops the same thing ( obviously from sharing towels or something ) so she goes to Marylebone hospital too, waits four hours and is told the same thing by a different doctor, it's untreatable. Knowing my story however my GF kicks off with the doctor saying that what she's been told is basically bullshit, she produces the list of meds I'm on, again though the doctor stubbornly won't budge and she comes out with nothing. I mean WTF?

So...we've been away on a press trip for four days ( very nice, all five star hotels, all free and we were looked after like kings, but I digress...that's another story ) my GF spent the whole time in agony and she's in bed today, both her eyes are in one hell of a mess, completely closed up and I'm having to look after her because she's basically blind at present so ( again ) I'm taking her to Kingston hospital instead tomorrow... to actually get some fucking treatment.

So what's my point here? Well the only reason I can think of is that Marylebone hospital is suffering from cuts and Kingston hospital isn't. I mean prescribed eye treatment can't be cheap can it? I can't think of another reason why we'd both be refused treatment at the same place. 

And... if this is the case how many other people are being misdiagnosed and refused treatment on this basis? Because if they are, then this is disgusting. 

WTF is going on? 

**TL;DR** I'm pretty sure both my girl and I were blatantly refused NHS treatment for a pretty serious eye issue because of budgeting cuts.

I'm a 19 year old American guy from Utah.  I've been saving up for a bit of an extended trip to the UK but I don't really know what to do about housing.

I want to stay in a suburb of Cardiff.  I'm planning to be there for 8-10 weeks, and I just want to get a feel for what it's like living over there.  I'm planning on taking trains around to see a bunch of the major tourist attractions, but I also want to experience the culture and entertainment around Cardiff.

I know there are plenty of hostels all around that are cheap, but I'd really like a bit of an established place to stay while I'm there.  Is it possible/easy for an American visitor to rent a flat for just 2 months?  What kind of requirements are there other than putting up the money?

Where would you suggest I stay?  Are there any ways to find rooms/flats cheaper if you know where to look?

I'm very excited to spend some time over there, and this is the last big hang up I'm having:  I don't know anything about housing over there, or how an American would go about renting a place for a short time.

If anybody could shed any light on this, I'd really appreciate it!

___

On Gallifrey, born 'n raised, but in the TARDIS' where I'd spend most of my days,

Chillin' out, maxin', relaxin' all cool,

Tryin' not break any timelord rules,

When some Cybermen 'n Daleks were up to no good,

and started makin' trouble in Torchwood!

I closed one little void-bridge and Rose got scared,

so I regenerated and.... now I've got long hair.
 
 
 
I snapped for the TARDIS and when it got near,

It was all different - I said, ""there's a pool in there!""

If anything I could tell this phonebox was weird,

but I said forget it man, I've got stolen threads to wear!
 
 
 
I-
 
re-
 
turned to Amy Pond about 12 years late,

To the TARDIS' pilot she yelled, ""WTF MATE?""

I invited her along plus one more rider,

which is a great excuse to try my new sonic screwdriver!

Ok so i will give some back story.  I recently moved from Canada to the UK with my wife about a year ago for a job.  Everything is great and we have settled in quite nicely aside from our experience with the NHS.  I think it really comes down to having a GP that doesn't care... but i will start from the beginning.  So we signed up with the local surgery as soon as we got here.  Our first contact with our GP was when my wife had to renew her prescription/ get a referal.  My wife has issues with cysts and while we were in Canada we were told by the specialist that it would have to be attended to but as we were leaving in a months time we should get it sorted when we get to the UK.  The Dr agreed to an ultrasound which surprisingly came back negative.  The thing is we KNOW there is an issue but the Dr refuses to accept any documentation from the Canadian specialist and will not send for a follow up ultrasound.  The second problem we have is that my wife is also bipolar, we have been referred to the consultant twice but have yet to actually see a psychiatrist.  Both times we saw Dr's in training, the first was horrible and awkward, while the second was actually really good and knowledgeable.  On both occasions we had to wait over an hour past our appointment to see the Dr's.  Further, as a part of being bipolar my wife is supposed (according to them) have bi-yearly appointments with her GP but on both occasions this has come up she was allocated to a locum GP who didn't even feel comfortable asking the questions nor did my wife feel comfortable answering them.  Lastly, I had to visit the Dr for three issues that i had.  I got through the first issue in less than 5 minutes and i started explaining my other when he stopped me saying ""wait how many problems do you have?"".  Sort of in a condescending, how many questions do you think you get to ask kind of way.  Anyways i am 99.9999% sure that this is just a case of having a horrible GP.  

So i guess my questions are:

(1):  Is it common to wait months for referrals - even for ultrasounds?
(2):  Is it common not to see the same Dr every time you see the GP?
(3):  How much time can you expect to spend with your GP on a regular appointment?
(4):  If you do not like how you are being treated what can you do?

I know it may sound like i am just a complainer but I really am not!  Also coming from Canada we are very familiar with a socialized medical system.  I am very passive and i don't like pushing anything unless i have to.  In any case we have decided to change GP's as it is probably just a case of a bad GP.

TL/DR: Have issues with my local surgery - questions above.

I have just started a new job with a growing company supporting the new business and marketing. I'm really excited about it.

It is a brand new role for the business, and I have a lot of scope (and budget) to support marketing efforts with projects to grab the attention of their prospects. We’d be looking to do infographics, competitor analysis on tweets, email newsletters, microsites and other cool projects.

I am primarily hoping to build up a list of awesome freelancers who can work on the variety of projects. It’d be great to have some existing contacts I can call upon with projects.
Please send me a PM and I’ll give you my email, and you can send over an introduction of what you do.


Also, I am working on a project **right now** that will involve analysing and comparing social media buzz around companies and presenting that data in a cool way.  Is this something you’d be interested in working on?

To coincide with Global Reddit Meet up day I have taken it upon myself to organise a Cardiff Meet Up.

Da Iawn Bach!

It will be held at Nos Da on the 25th June starting from 8pm! For those who don't know it's a small hostel across the river from the Millenium Stadium. 

Good beer, there is a pool table, and a decent outdoor seating area if the weather plays nice.

There was a good response in the recent 'announce yourselves thread' so hopefully a few people will be interested. 

Don't leave me Forever Alone Wales!

Now, not trying to stir up any ire from the die hard whovians, but suppose they were going to recast the actors of the first seven doctors, preferably moderate lookalikes with a modicum of acting ability. Who do you think could pick up these iconic roles?
My choices: I would suggest Anton Lesser (Gideon in Season 4 of Primeval) as the 1st, Sean Pertwee to take his father's place as the 3rd, and Jon Culshaw does a pretty spot on 4th Doctor impression on Dead Ringers. I haven't put much thought into the other four.

I've seen enough discussion to assume that this season is about the pre-bang universe and the reconstructed universe colliding.  Now bear with me.

Amy and Rory have been married for a couple months before the impossible astronaut, ensuring that a baby can be conceived without any wedlock issues. Amy was captured by the silence and they said ""you will bring the silence"".  she saw the picture of herself, and i think its safe to assume they messed with the baby and using their tardis, wibbly wobbly timey time, its her grown baby in the astronaut suit.  BUT she's still pregnant in the alternate universe. That's why the tardis is reading both ways.  Eventually, worlds collide and pregnant Amy has to give birth to her half baby.  The only way to do this involves more timey wimey wibbly wobbly temporal shift eyepatch midwife, which causes Amy to either relive or recall her time unpregnant while halucinating the midwife.  the crew somehow have to deal with silence made regererating astronaut Amy baby, and then Amy gives half-birth to river song, who eventually timey wimey wibbly wobbly kills her father Rory before she's half-born.

Back on Gallifrey with his head hung low
Couldn't win the Time War, they all had to go
In a silent flash, bright as he’d ever seen
He destroyed them all, all without a scream
He took his TARDIS far, had to get away
He had fire in his eyes, there was no other way

Brought a companion with him. Not alone anymore
Didn't know where they were going, but he knew for sure
That sonic tool felt good in his hand. Doesn't take long to visit distant lands
They took his TARDIS far, met the Face of Boe
Didn’t need a ticket for anywhere they’d want to go
He kept on runnin', ain't never gonna stop
Gotta keep on runnin', save the Universe a lot

And be a fob watch hero, got fire in his eyes, he's a fob watch hero
He took his TARDIS far, fob watch hero, fire in his eyes
Fob watch hero, (fire in his eyes) He'll regenerate tonight

The Doctor is his name. Don’t ask for more.
Thought he saw two shadows, on the Library door
All his trips to the past couldn’t take his pain
The Last Great Time War, made his whole life change
Now he needs to keep on runnin’, he just can't stop
Gotta keep on runnin', save the Universe a lot

And be a fob watch hero, got fire in his eyes
He's a fob watch hero, got fire in his eyes
Yeah, fob watch hero, fire in his eyes
Took his TARDIS, (fire in his eyes)
He'll regenerate, regenerate tonight

Yeah, he's gotta keep on runnin, just can't stop
Gotta keep on runnin', save the Universe a lot

And be a fob watch hero, got fire in his eyes
He's a fob watch hero, got fire in his eyes
(Took his TARDIS far) fob watch hero, got fire in his eyes

Amy's Choice introduced us to some major concepts of Series 6. Amy's Pregnancy, alternate realities (in the form of dreams), and the dark side of the Doctor. Also I think Amy actually having to make a choice will be important.

(Spoilers if you haven't seen the latest 3 episodes.)

We've been introduced to the concept of Amy being ""quantum pregnant"". Two possible realities, universes, timelines. I believe Amy will have to make a very hard choice to determine what reality she wants to occur.

We have also been introduced to the concept of traveling through universes in the form of reflections. There have been various posts citing every example of a reflection when something wonky occurs. There are so many examples, like the lake the astronaut walks out of, the astronauts helmut. A mirror being present when Amy tells the doctor she is pregnant. The most startling example of a reflection, after watching Amy's Choice, is the Doctor seeing the dream lords reflection in the glass of the tardis!!

Amy is having visions of the Eye Patch Lady. Who also has a shiny silver eyepatch. (Which in itself is another reflection.) What's sort of too coincidental to shrug off, is that when amy was awake in the Impossible Astronaut/Day Of the Moon, Eyepatch Lady said, 'I think she's just dreaming.' meaning she was probably asleep in the other universe. When she was asleep in the pirate episode, the Eyepatch Lady is talking to her as if she was awake. She's awake in one universe and asleep in the other.

Every week I've been posting the latest doctor who episode, usually 1-3 minutes after it comes online (which is way faster than most public sites, BTW).


However, this year it has taken off. Last year I would have 1000-2000 downloads however episode 2 and 3.8k and 5k.. which is bloody insane...


So to keep me from going into bankruptcy, I will no longer be directly hosting the 720p, only the AVI file.


I will however be uploading the 720p + confidentials to file sharing websites (rapidshare, megaupload, filevo, etcetc) and if anyone wants to mirror them elsewhere, give me a private message and I'll send you the MKV each week and you can post it in the thread.


I've also been having a bit of ""outside of reddit"" links, and from episode 4 onwards you can only access it by being referred from the reddit thread - this should lower the amount of bandwidth as well.


I'm not going to be doing advertising, as I think that was bad form on my part (which I did a few weeks ago).

Published Date: 13 May 2011

By John Kelly

The past few months have exposed the poisonous reality of anti-Irish and anti-Catholic prejudice in this country's society
RECENT events have exposed the seeping wound that is Scotland's Shame, illuminating the country's ongoing problems with the ills of ethno-religious prejudice.

Often confusingly labelled ""sectarianism"", ethno-religious prejudice, particularly of th
e anti-Catholic variety, is still alive and (literally) kicking in 2011.

Just hours after Celtic manager Neil Lennon was physically assaulted by an opposing fan, to the apparent delight of many fans in the stadium, two people were arrested by police in connection with a supected letter bomb sent to the football coach.

While these arrests were being made, police were called to investigate yet another suspicious package addressed to the Northern Irishman.

Whilst Scotland is not Ulster minus the bullets and the fact that the problem has improved in the last thirty or so years, mixed marriages, increasing secularism, equitable employment practices and an increasingly internationalist outlook in Scotland, have not, it seems, led to the same level of cultural shifts in beliefs and behaviour.

Cultural shifts emerge out of residual legacies and these behavioural shifts lag behind the statistical facts and figures that paint a different picture of demographic harmony.

In other words, the times are changing and fewer people define themselves in everyday life as religiously separate, and alongside this so are the attitudes changing, but the attitudes are lagging behind.

Yet, while sociologist Bert Moorhouse once noted the Glasgow derby provided a convenient whiff of primitive savagery that titillated Scotland's southern neighbours, he failed to highlight the nauseating reality that sections within Scottish society foam equally at the mouth for such ""rivalry"". But is it simply a football problem?

It is patently flawed to revert to lazy soundbites about the problems of the Old Firm and the west coast when this year we have witnessed the hatred and intolerance transcend these much-maligned borders.

In addition to a politician and a QC - albeit both with Celtic FC connections - receiving letter bombs, Cardinal Keith O'Brien, Scotland's most senior Roman Catholic clergyman and an Irish cultural-political organisation have also received bullets and a letter bomb in the post.

This is, of course, in addition to Celtic players Niall McGinn and Paddy McCourt - both Northern Irish Catholics - receiving bullets in the post. The choice of targets here is revealing and tells us a lot about the essence of ethno-religious prejudice in Scotland.

A cursory analysis of the targets reveals the common denominators to be one or some of the following combination; high profile Roman Catholic in Scotland, Celtic FC connection, Irish. This hits at the heart of the issue

Forget the nonsensical half excuses, peddled by those who should know better, that Lennon ""brings it on himself"", that ""he's a fiery character"" or that he ""has to shoulder part of the blame"".

Apart from a naive determination and excitable approach to his new profession - shared by many other determined coaches, yet never precipitating such reactions - Lennon has done nothing wrong except to refuse to behave like the Irish Catholics of previous generations in Scotland and ""keep the heid doon"".

As others have noted in relation to racist societies, for many, racism becomes a normal pathology.

There are shades here of the McPherson Report's findings of institutional racism within London's Metroploitcan Police, and the English Police Complaints Commission's findings on institutional disabilism in England.

Rather than sections of Scotland being purposely anti-Irish Catholic, there is a lack of acknowledgment that the problem exists accompanied by a lack of strategic organisation to deal with it.

For example, in response to the mass choruses of anti-Irish Catholic signing witnessed clearly at the recent Scottish League Cup Final between Celtic and Rangers, justice secretary Kenny MacAskill described the event as a ""wonderful advert for Scotland and ""the final we all wanted to see"".

Additionally, it is revealing that it is the European governing body UEFA and not any of its Scottish counterparts - or indeed Scottish members - that have been most active in dealing with the anti-Catholic chanting of a section of Rangers fans.

Recent events have buried the myth that anti-Irish Catholic bigotry no longer exists or that it is a symptom of paranoid fantasists.

Sadly, however, as we've seen with the Lennon affair, like the disabled and black minorities in England, the victim is either not acknowledged as a victim or if he is, he's held responsible and told to change his behaviour.

The elephant in the room has this year been exposed and it is that sections of Scottish society still harbour a culturally ingrained antipathy or sleeping bigotry towards Celtic, Catholics and Irishness, particularly when these three intersect, and it can result in the naked hatred Neil Lennon has been dealing with for large parts of his time in Scotland

It is true that football, for some reason, tends to provide the type of setting many deem to be appropriate for such prejudiced behaviour and this is due to two main factors.

First, football fans by their nature try to antagonise their opponents and this often results in derogatory chanting against a sporting rival (or besting an ""Other"" as sociologists call it).

Linked to this is the desire by many football fans, in an age of increasing uncertainty around what authentic fandom constitutes, to prove their credentials. Sociologists call this trying to make gains in distinction.

Second, in making gains in distinction and proving one's self as an authentic fan, supporters tend to engage in group behaviour, in what psychologists may call social desirability behaviours.

In other words, we end up with groups of supporters behaving at football matches in ways that they would never dream of in other social situations in the belief that this is not only acceptable, but down right desirable. Moreover, they react according to the situation and play up to certain stereotypes.

Hence the reason we see many more Union Flags and Red Hand of Ulster flags in the Hearts end when they play Celtic (and Hibs to a lesser extent) and also why we hear many more Irish rebel songs from Celtic fans when Celtic play Rangers or Hearts.

Unfortunately, like homophobia and sexism, ethno-religious bigotry is still deemed fair game in many a football stadium and supporters' bus and this is part of a wider cultural shift that is still in the process of modernising.

One should add, of course, that ethno-religious prejudice is only one of a number of prejudices one can be exposed to around British football matches.

In trying to deal with racial and disabled minority prejudices in England, stakeholders have realised that they need to recognise and understand the problem in the first place. At the heart of any solution to equalising uneven power relationships is the need to expose prejudice and celebrate difference.

Different identities are legitimate and rather than attempt to tell others how to think, we should try to understand why others think the way they do.

At the heart of any difference should also be tolerance. This is why the ethno-religious difference needs to be separated from political difference.

Political identity has at its heart the need to best the ""Other"". Religious and ethnic identities should not be celebrated by besting the ""Other"" or there is the danger that Neil Lennon may not be the last to experience such naked bigotry in Scotland ",false,Glasgow_Celtic,t5_2rgo4,null,null,self,Scotland's Shame is alive and kicking - From The Scotsman Newspaper.,1,http://www.reddit.com/r/Glasgow_Celtic/comments/hagol/scotlands_shame_is_alive_and_kicking_from_the/

5/13/2011

Associated Press

Orlando, Fl, USA -- NASA Archivist Harold Morrow is a rational man,
and he will probably remind you of that at least 5 times during a
normal conversation. Some people would say that that sounds like he
is overcompensating, and he says he probably agrees with that. ""But
it's not that I'm crazy. That's not what I'm compensating for. I'm
compensating for the fact that I'm saying things I know damned well
sound crazy.""

That might be a subtle distinction, but it's one that is very important
to Mr. Morrow.

Harold knows the company he's going to be keeping from now on, whether
he likes it or not. UFO fanatics, Illuminati conspiracists, and
Moon Landing deniers. ""Oh, God, the Hoaxers. I hate them more than
anyone else, because at least the other popular conspiracy theories
are built around inventing fantastical ideas. That's the only one I
can think of that focuses specifically on making the world a more
boring place -- that works actively to deny obvious facts, instead of
inventing ridiculous ones"".

But, just to be clear, Harold does neither. He's not denying the truth
of the moon landings, or any other well-established historical fact.
Nor is he trying to push an imagined scenario on anyone. He openly
admits that he has no explanation, rational or otherwise, for the
curious phenomena he has been patiently documenting and (in a few
cases) observing himself. He is, in fact, doing exactly what he always
does -- archiving facts and evidence, without passing judgement.

But those facts and evidence (assuming one accepts that that's what
they are) are more than a little bizarre, which is what makes Harold
worry about his reputation and, possibly, his sanity.

""It comes down to a simple question: What is wrong with the Apollo 11
Footage?"", says Harold. ""'Nothing', is what most people would say. Or,
more likely, 'What?'"" He gives self-deprecating laugh at that; he's
gotten that response quite a bit. But it doesn't change the way he
feels. ""Something is wrong. I don't know what, but I'm going to keep
collecting evidence until I find out what it is.""

This pursuit (or, as some might say, obsession) began in 1998. Harold
was in the middle of a massive archival project in preparation for the
30th anniversary of Neil Armstrong's famous first step, and on one of
his rare nights off he was talking to his uncle David about the event.
David had been a young man barely out of high school at the time, and
(like almost anyone old enough to remember it) he had vivid memories of
that moment. But he also remembered something else. Something
very strange happened to him that day. ""David is not the kind of guy
to make up crazy stories, but this was a weird one,"" says Harold.

""First of all, you have to understand that David is an avid hunter. Has
been since he was old enough to fire a gun; it's just part of his family's
tradition. So the fact that he had a handgun on his belt while he was
watching Neil Armstrong climb down the ladder is not at all unusual. In
fact, I think he had just come back from a hunting trip; maybe he was
cleaning his rifle while he was watching it.""

But what happened to him was definitely unusual. ""I guess you could call
it a blackout,"" says Harold. ""He remembers that opening line, the infamous
flub by Neil, 'That's one small step for [a] man...', and the next thing
he remembers, his pistol was on the table, smoking, with a round missing
from the cylinder. And he had that fluttery, anxious feeling in his
stomach that you get after a fight or a good scare. In his words, 'I felt
like I had just been jumped by a Grizzly, and barely escaped with my life'.""

This probably would have lingered as nothing more than an odd family
anecdote if it hadn't been for Harold's job. As part of his work on the
30th Anniversary Retrospective, he was interviewing people around the
country about their memories of the Apollo 11 landing. ""If I hadn't heard
David's story first, I probably wouldn't have noticed anything. But he
set me in just the right state of mind to see these things -- subtle
behaviors from people I was interviewing. Sometimes they would tense up,
almost imperceptibly, while describing their memories. They would often
look like they wanted to tell me something else, but were just holding
it back. A few people even started to mention something, but were cut
off by their spouses or kids, like 'OK, Dad, don't make us look stupid
by bringing that up again.'""

But Harold wanted to hear it. It wasn't stupid to him, and he wanted them to
know that he wouldn't judge them or look down on them. ""I was there to hear
stories. And I wanted the real stories, not the sanitized Norman Rockwell
crap. So I kept pursuing it."" And what he found painted an increasingly bizarre
and disturbing picture -- disturbing, more than anything else, for its
consistency.

""That's the really creepy thing about it. These are not just a handful of
random blackout stories that can be explained away by epileptic seizures
or too many glasses of wine. They follow a pretty clear pattern."" The
template was defined by Harold's uncle David, and almost all of the subsequent
stories seemed to follow it.

The basic elements are pretty straightforward: A person would be watching
Neil's first steps on the moon, hear that famous ""One small step"" line,
and would experience a sudden discontinuity in time. This short blackout
would often be followed by objects inexplicably appearing out of place --
a baseball bat, a tire iron, a kitchen knife, sometimes a firearm with
a round or two missing. And those present often reported physical symptoms
following the event; symptoms indicative of severe physical and emotional
stress consistent with a massive release of adrenaline. And it wasn't just
the night of the landing itself; these incidents seemed to repeat -- sometimes
from the same individuals -- on subsequent viewings of the video.

""It's like this footage was scaring the hell out of people, but they had
no idea why and not even any memory of being scared.""

After collecting enough evidence, Harold decided to take the chance of bringing
it to the attention of his supervisors. ""I felt like an idiot, but I just
couldn't ignore it anymore, and I had to let someone know."" What was the
response? ""Silence,"" says Harold. ""Total silence. In a way, that was the
scariest thing about it. It would be a lot more reassuring if they had laughed
in my face and told me to take some time off.""

For now, after an initial flurry of activity, the trail seems to have gone
cold. Harold has found it increasingly difficult to find new information on
this topic, but he has two more interesting data points to fit into this
still poorly-formed narrative. The first one is that the number of incidents
seemed to be primarily concentrated in the first 5 years after the Apollo
11 landing. ""They tapered off pretty dramatically after that. There have
been occasional reports since, some as recent as the mid '90s. But those
are extremely rare.""

The other discovery may constitute the only shred of corroborating physical
evidence Harold has discovered to date, although it is pretty weak and --
consistent with everything else in this story -- very strange. ""It's the length
of the video,"" says Harold. ""It doesn't match observation times."" Asked to
clarify, Harold describes the discrepancy thus: Find video footage of Neil
Armstrong's first step and watch it from beginning to end while counting the
time in your head. Compare the time you count with the displayed length of
the video. ""I can almost guarantee that they won't match. Not only will they
not match, but the difference is surprisingly consistent -- about four to four
and a half seconds. Not too many people have done this experiment, because
it takes some time and it's so strange that most people don't see the point.
But almost every time someone has done it, the results have been the same.""

So what does this mean? ""I have no idea,"" laughs Harold. ""Truly; I don't
even have a guess. It just makes no sense whatsoever.""

So this takes us back full-circle to the original question: What is wrong with the
Apollo 11 footage? Has it been doctored somehow? Is something missing, or has
something been added? ""I just don't know,"" admits Harold. ""I know this seems
like I've wasted a lot of time for no result, but I just can't shake the feeling
that there's something there that we need to know about. And I'm just too
invested in it at this point to give up.""",false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,null,null,self,"For /r/DoctorWho, taken from the AP wire: ""What is wrong with the Apollo 11 footage?""",323,http://www.reddit.com/r/doctorwho/comments/hap75/for_rdoctorwho_taken_from_the_ap_wire_what_is/

Link: http://30.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_l4whdgfLRf1qbtlfeo1_500.png
Which has been absence since the start of Series 6 - which is a bit odd.

So - I was wondering (and I haven't seen it posted here - but if I'm being redundant feel free to ignore) - is it possible this is where the story lines diverged?  Moffat has talked about wanting the series to feel more like a fairy tale, River Song also commented that we were all fairy tales, so it seems like the symbol would be important.  The whole story of Snow White, the poison apple, the cursed sleep and the magic mirror.

If, as some are speculating, Amy is on two different paths that are converging (pregnant in one universe, not in the other), is it possible that the two different stories begin with her recalling the Doctor in to existence?  This might also tie in to River Song's unlikely presence at the wedding and her ability to remember the Doctor despite the fact that her diary (containing her history/experience with him) is blank.  If River is crossing over from another universe at that point in the story where the Doctor does exist.

It's sort of half baked and not fully formed - but feel free to add thoughts, build on it or tear it down!",false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,null,null,self,Amy Pond and an apple - Series 6 Speculation,38,http://www.reddit.com/r/doctorwho/comments/has55/amy_pond_and_an_apple_series_6_speculation/

Not the Weeping Angels, not the Daleks, or Cybermen or the Empty Child, but the Vashta Nerada and the Silence. I honestly think his take on these two monsters is the cutest thing I've ever heard, so here we go:

""The Silence are kind of cool looking, but they have no mouth, which is kind of weird. And then they have a mouth and shoot lightning and then you pop like a balloon but no one remembers you because they make you forget, so a whole lot of people could die and we wouldn't even know, which makes them scary but also kind of cool. Because they could be real but aren't. I think.""

""Those shadow things- Vashta Nerada?- are scary because they could be everywhere. They eat you, and then you repeat, and it's just weird. But if they're in that dark place under my bed, or in the morning before the sun is up and you're still asleep because you stayed up playing XBox again.""

On a side note, this is from the little boy who is so amused by Daleks that they've made him piss himself, and who scared the shit out of ***me*** one of those morning when I was sleeping in. 

I have some militaria, and one such object is a WWII-era gas mask. I don't like keeping that in my room, because it freaks the shit out of me. So one morning (read: 11-12 o'clock) I'm fast asleep. There's a little knock on my door. 

I open my eyes and murmer ""Whoizit?""

""Are you my mummy?"" A perfect British accent, from a little boy outside my door. I am instantly wide awake.

""Wha-how-who?"" I am now cowering under my covers, and hear the door open... The covers are pulled back, I look up, and there's a small, tawny-haired child wearing a gas mask. My eyes fly open faster than a weeping angel. Then, the child begins to giggle furiously. He pulls the mask off, and it is my little brother. He grins a huge, shit-eating grin, and repeats ""Mummy?"".

Then I grabbed a boffing sword and chased him out of my bedroom.

For some reason, I always thought that the TARDIS had actually taken over Rose when she absorbed the energy from the time vortex. I spent the whole episode wondering why the Doctor was so elated to speak to the TARDIS because I had always thought that he did before.

Then I read that little wikipedia blurb on Bad Wolf and realized that Bad Wolf was a superpowered version of Rose and not the TARDIS at all.

I've usually got pretty good comprehension skills and I don't think the Bad Wolf episode went over my head, so I wonder if anyone else was thinking the same thing.

There are two trains of thought when dealing with time travel. Both are stable (in my opinion). The first theory is that anytime you travel between times you enter into a separate universe. In this way everything that happened before you moved in time still happened, and any changes to the timeline can propagate in it's own universe.

An easy way of imagining this is that there are two universes, one where you grew up and exist to the point where you went back in time, and the other universe where you exist at some point in the past apart from your self who may or may not exist. So even if you kill your past self, you would still exist to do it.

The other theory is that time travel is circular. In this theory it is impossible to change the timeline because anything you do has already happened. If you go back in time to kill someone you dislike who is still alive in the present. You won't be able to do it because you didn't since he is still alive.

The main problem I have with most ideas of time travel is when something exists solely in a time bubble. An example of this would be you handing yourself a letter. You read the letter, go back in time, then hand it back to yourself. The letter has no starting or ending point which doesn't make sense.

Anyone have any holes in these two theories? I've tried to remove problems such as the grandfather paradox from them both, though the second one doesn't stand up quite as easily (and is harder to explain).",false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,null,null,self,How I view time travel,0,http://www.reddit.com/r/doctorwho/comments/hbhkc/how_i_view_time_travel/

But in all seriousness, I remember reading rumors two summer's ago that Chelsea were interested in purchasing Ashley Young from Aston Villa. I don't know too much about Ashley Young and haven't seen a lot of tape of him play, but his youth and athleticism could definitely prove to be a contributing factor for Chelsea's inevitable title push next year.

Seeing as he is young and athletic on the wing, and more than willing to depart from Villa, many clubs are going to make a push to sign him as well. Two questions:


- Do you think Chelsea have a legitimate shot at signing him?

- How effective do you think he will be if he were to join Chelsea?


Hopefully, Carlo Ancelotti will return next season and instill his 4-3-3 scheme that helped Chelsea win the title in his first season as manager. I think the defense and midfield are solid, but there are questions with that front line. We could very well see a Young, Torres, Sturridge front 3 (I don't know how well Sturridge would play on a wing).",false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,null,null,self,Ashley Young to Chelsea -- a possibility?,9,http://www.reddit.com/r/chelseafc/comments/hbljy/ashley_young_to_chelsea_a_possibility/

I had heard so many things. It's a plucked piano wire, it's plucked string, plucked this, plucked that. Tonight I just came across [this page](http://www.woodysweb.co.uk/bbcrw/bbcrw-dw) which suggests it could also be a **rubber band** of all things.

So ""what the hell,"" I thought... I have a rubber band and a microphone. I stretched a rubber band over a shoe box (Converse! I'm a Chunk fan because of Who, seemed appropriate :D) and recorded a sample.

[Holy crap!](http://goldjinjo.site40.net/share/Rubber%20Band.mp3) A result!

This is the closest I've ever got. It's not perfect, but the pluck is Just. Right. It *works*. It has that right feel to it. I used a cardboard shoe box, it could potentially sound more authentic if I stretched it over a wooden box (that's what I heard was used, but who knows).

So is it a rubber band? I still don't know. The history of what Delia Derbyshire used still seems too unclear. But after a few minutes of playing around with this, I'd say Myth Plausible.

Well, as promised, here's the anticipated Preview you've been waiting to sink your teeth into.

I hope you treat your TARDIS as nicely as she deserves to be treated ;)

[Fallout: Who Vegas] Out of Time - Preview

So what to expect from Out of Time? Without giving too much of the plot away, we can honestly say Moffat's Series 5 inspired the Time Wimey attributes of the quest at heart. The adventure takes you on a trip into the future, the past and beyond, to save the fate of the Multiverse from its impending collapse. You'll be facing off against Weeping Angels, Silurians, Sontarans, Cyberman and of course Daleks, plus a menagerie of secret creatures we just can't reveal right now.

On top of all that, the odd familiar face and theme will be popping up, and as opposed to its predecessor, Out of Time's quest doesn't end at the first hurdle.

You'll need to ramp up your piloting skills to Masterey to unlock the finale of the story and embark on an explosive end to the story.

Along with the main quest, your whizzing to and fro from the surface of the Earth to far reaches of the Universe doesn't end with simple flight and frolic. Threats lurk in the Mojave; Cyber-conversion Chambers in the sewers that need shutting down, Nestene Transmission Towers which need deactivating and Silurian Hibernation Settlements which must be put back to sleep.

Collect trophies from your adventures and store them in the TARDIS Art Gallery as a reminder of your travels, and speaking of the TARDIS...

...from the Last Child of Gallifrey you were brought a TARDIS interior utilising content from the Fallout 3 Universe. Well not anymore. Steppin beyond those Blue doors reveals a completely, created from scratch interior, with a network of vein like corridors, snaking up, down and round and around. Visit the Library/Swimming Pool for a dip or a read, gather your thoughts in the tranquility of the Garden or simply refine to your quarters and relax in the comfort of a customisable living space.

On top of this, all the interactive controls are animated and provide unique sounds straight from the series, immersing you in a believable TARDIS environment.

So until then, keep watching for further updates, enjoy the below preview screens and new teaser Trailer. ""

I'm of the opinion that we're supposed to have already seen the picnic at Asgard, because it was the picnic at the start of this season.

Why do I think this? Well, first, there's a picnic. That's a very rare thing in Who to begin with. Then there's the location that the scene was actually filmed at. Valley of the Gods, Utah, United States of America. This could be brushed off if we didn't also see the viking funeral of the Doctor. Asgard itself can be roughly translated to mean a world within some sort of enclosure. So a valley with high walls might make perfect sense.

Which translates to: ""While we are silent, we are screaming. Save me and I will save you.""
 
""Dum inter homines sumus colamus humanitatem. Cum tacent clamant.""
 
That translates to: ""As long as we are among humans, let us be humane. With silence we shout.""

What do you think? Coincidence? Could that have been the inspiration for ""Silence will fall""? Or perhaps they were planning this season even that far back.
