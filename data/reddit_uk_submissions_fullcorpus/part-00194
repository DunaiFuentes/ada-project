I have a message to British people. Stop bashing other countries.

You made extremely aggressive comment against France recently. We have things in our press that say your banks made very aggressive comments. Same for your prime minister, very violent comments. They say that France is doomed and that it is chaos, blablabla..

You decided to privatize your public services, cut help to the poor, and help your bankers friends. It's your choice. 

Your economy is based on finance. A bunch of oxford/eton/cambridge old guys in expensive  suits moving money around with computers and robbing people blind while they play on libor rates, gold rates, metal rates, when they are not crashing the entire economic system. All your money is going to the Cayman Islands, the British Virgin Island, and other tax heavens. You keep cutting public services and giving them to private corporations so they can fist-fuck you. Feel the ""free market"" corporate hand. So stop attacking others.

We have nothing against you, but you seem extremely mad.  Your politicians and bankers make very aggressive comments. We have nothing against you, so stop attacking others.  Live and let live. Peace.

**New Teams this Week**

6 new teams joined this week, making the amount of teams in the league now 189. New teams joining make lower ranked teams lose a rank just by joining; the higher they are ranked, the greater an impact they will have on the league's players. Here are the new teams ranked by how much of an impact their joining has had (how many teams have gone down as a result). **Delta Cubes** had the greatest impact, joining the league ranking 4th, making 97.9% of the league's players lose a rank. Second was **Ruud van Mitchelrooy**, whose impact affected 95.8% of players coming in ranking 8th.

**Tottenham 1 - 0 Southampton**

Well we were never going to win every game! I've watched most of Poch's games this season and Spurs played by far their best football against us, I don't think we really expected them to have changed quite so much from their previous games. But we did only lose by a single goal and in an alternate universe we could've definitely got a point from there. Mane's miss being the obvious talking point but going into the International break, Koeman will have a few things to think about.

[Hull 2-0 Crystal Palace:](http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/29389681) Hull are looking like a very capable side this year, not going to be an easy away trip in a few weeks time. 

[Leicester 2-2 Burnley:](http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/29389664) Never really a bad result for two teams below us to draw when it's this early in the season.

[Liverpool 2-1 West Brom:](http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/29389680) But of a shame that West Brom couldn't get anything from this game, Lallana scored if anyone still gives a toss. 

[Sunderland 3-1 Stoke:](http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/29389678) Our next fixture after the break is home to Sunderland, they're not looking too bad this season but I'd still feel confident we can win. 

[Swansea 2-2 Newcastle:](http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/29389679) Another draw between two very capable sides so can't complain! 

[Aston Villa 0-2 Man City:](http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/29389665) Not a surprise here, probably a good thing if the top few teams consistently win against everyone else. 

[Man Utd 2 -1 Everton:](http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/29398862) Despite a couple of poor results at the start of the season, I think it's very likely that Utd will get top 4 this year and I'd like to think we could be fighting with Everton for position so a good result. 

[Chelsea 2-0 Arsenal:](http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/29398780) Can anyone beat Chelsea this year? It's going to be a tough fixture for sure. 

[West Ham 2-0 QPR:](http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/29398822) Our win away to West Ham is looking even more of a solid result than I thought at the time, they're not playing badly at all.

I hope for better writing and plot for the rest of the season. 

What I don't get is this whole ""the episode was pro-choice"" idea. That makes no sense. First of all you can't have an abortion right before a baby is born. Secondly it seemed like the writers were trying very hard to show that killing the alien was the wrong thing to do. The whole world voted to kill it but as always, Clara made the ""right"" decision and saved it. And third of all, the consequences of abortion are on whether or not it's murder and the psychological impact on the people involved. It is not a life or death situation for anybody besides the fetus which is not what happened in this episode.

This seemed like a clear ""needs of the many vs the needs of the few"" situation. Everyone knew that objectively, it was a bad thing for a baby alien that was last of its species to die. The problem is whether its life is more important than the billions of lives that would be effected by its birth. In a perfect world (which the end of the episode kind of showed it is) nobody would have to die. Clara was left with an impossible decision that had absolutely nothing to do with the pro-life vs pro-choice argument.

Edit: it's interesting to see so many people saying its a clear stand for either anti-abortion or pro-choice. I think that the fact it's so split shows that there's not really any clear message.

As I explained in my previous post, I'm a newbie when it comes to cigars, so forgive me if I'm being a bit daft in this.

I'm thinking of buying a box of something that I can hand out come March as my wife is currently pregnant with our first (the baby is due just a week after my 30th, so it's a bit of a double whammy!).

For whatever reason, Cohiba Maduro 5 Secretos have taken my fancy, but obviously I'm not wanting to splash out on a box of something I'm unsure that I will enjoy.

Now, a couple of things: if I get a box of these (or whatever else) then should I get them earlier and rest them in a tupperdor to age for a wee while before March?

If I do have to age in a tupperdor, what Boveda pack should I go for? 62/69/72? Is there a rough length of time to age?

As for the actual selection of a cigar, as I said, the Cohiba Secretos has peaked my interest. There is a B&amp;M shop near me in Glasgow that I could pick up a single to try, but again, if I buy a single should it be aged first?

So, if the Secretos are good then hurrah! If not, I'm open to suggestions. I'll be looking at ones for a box of 10, around £100-150 max.",false,ukcigars,t5_33cs8,null,null,self,Some Questions,5,http://www.reddit.com/r/ukcigars/comments/2ig641/some_questions/

I'm on Universal Credit. 

The problem is that to qualify for UC you have to spend at least 35 hours a week looking for work.

I'm about 5 hours in and I'm already running out of options. I've logged my CV anywhere that will take it. I've checked the usual job listing websites. I've checked job after job on the government universal job match (which is years behind even the worst other job listing websites).

I honestly don't see how a person can spend 35 hours a week applying for work without basically doing busy work- something I am not going to do. By busy work I mean checking listings you checked only a day ago, or going for a walk and claiming you were looking for advertised vacancies (my adviser told me to do this- I've never known a shop in this day and age just take CVs from people).

It's almost like the set up is designed to reward for you doing the slowest, most inefficient job search possible. Got a typing speed and IT literacy level of a tree? Great- it will take you four hours a day just to go through one website listing and another 2 hours to complete an application. Job done.

On the other hand in the past 5 hours I've applied for three jobs and stand a reasonable chance with at least two of them (the third is a cheeky application that's a little over my skill level, but nothing ventured). Someone with less IT skill would have done far less, and yet wouldn't be facing the same pressures as they have technically complied with the rules of UC.

I just don't know how I can do this when I can get a fully customized application prepared and sent within 20 minutes of locating a suitable job, and checking listings takes maybe three or four hours- at most.

And to cap it off the UC is paid 5 weeks after your initial interview. 5 weeks. Good luck if you need to pay rent or something, I hope you've got some savings. They say that an advance can be arranged, but then why not just do the sane thing and pay the benefit on the month after the application so that the person's bills and debits get honored?

This entire set up has me very, very worried and has not been well thought out.

Christ I nearly forgot. I was the first person the Job Center had dealt with on UC. The process took over 2 hours- most of which was my adviser on the phone to someone else trying to work out how to save. I can't say for certain but it looks like she had no actual training, just a step by step guide printed on low grade paper that was absolutely cryptic. I can appreciate this is a new system but I would expect a higher level of staff capability than hanging off the phone for 2 hours and repeatedly thanking me for my patience.

Anyone at the DWP know what's going on?

**Edit**

Should say the staff at the job center were very nice and understanding, but it was still immensely vexing that they didn't seem to know a thing. I'm sure it's not their fault (given the lack of attention to detail I've seen in UC so far it wouldn't shock me if no one had thought to train staff on the new systems), but if I'm here I might as well vent.",false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,null,null,self,Anyone got any ideas how I can spend 35 hours a week meaningfully looking for work?

The reason I ask comes from Danny's reaction in ""The Caretaker"". He reacted as though he had never encountered alien technology/species but everything from the Slitheen crash, the Battle of Canary Wharf, the Dalek's moving the earth to the little black boxes has happened on Earth in recent times.
I know with Donna it was a bit of a (ultimately ironic/bittersweet) joke that she kept missing all the things that had happened and had no recollection of it when she would encounter things but I can't work out if something happened during the change from RTD to Moffat that explained this (like the reboot of the universe etc.)?

First of all, the science. So many people have complained about the Moon's fluctuating mass, while saying ""well they never gave a sci fi explanation so they should have followed real life physics"", with the flaw I see in this argument being that the egg contains a massive creature that can fly with wings in a vacuum. It is already established that there is some kind of sci fi thing going on with the creature, and changing mass isn't any harder to explain with ""trans-dimensional mass shifting"" or whatever than flying with wings in a vacuum. They should have included this explanation, yes, but that doesn't ruin the episode, to me at least.

The problem everyone seems to have had, though, was the behaviour of the Doctor and Clara. This is a MUCH more important issue unless you are trying to watch Doctor Who as a documentary, and if you are going to dismiss this episode as ""trash"", please at least justify your reaction dramatically rather than scientifically, because this is after all a show more about it's characters than the laws of physics.

Anyway, the argument against the Doctor, that he abandoned Clara and left her to make a decision that was ""humanity's alone to decide"", when he has very clearly interfered before, is actually something I am unsure about. It was pretty heavily implied that the decision made was the biggest in human history, as the one thing that motivated us to begin exploring the universe, which would eventually lead to us surviving until the end of the universe, so it does make sense that he would leave the decision to a human, but it was definitely unnecessary for him to leave Clara to make that decision. 

I don't think that makes him cruel, or a bully, though, because it is WELL established that this Doctor doesn't think the way humans do, and also, he has a time machine. It would have been very easy for him to intervene had the wrong decision had been made, and I really think that he would have, but he didn't because he trusted Clara to make the right decision even though she didn't have all the facts, and I think that is the first real issue. He trusted Clara to endanger every life on Earth, although he knew there was no danger, but she didn't. It was adressed in the end THAT he overstepped the mark, by Clara being furious at him, but not really why, and although the ""big decision should be humanity's"" sort of makes sense, it isn't enough to justify the way he behaved. It could have been a test, I suppose, but even though I believe he would have intervened if necessary it was still VERY poorly thought out no matter how you look at it.

On to the way Clara behaved (I will stop soon, I promise), and the way she gave Earth a choice, and then ignored the decision. I think it was less of an intentional and conscious choice to go against humanity, and more of an ""Oh my god no I can't do this"" chicken out, which is understandable for a human. 

Issue 2 with Clara is the wat she got angry with the Doctor. When I saw the episode, I suppose my view was sort of biased, because the BBC would never show the heroes killing an innocent being, so I was tired of her panicking because it was obvious that saving the Moon would be the right choice. When you look at it from the point of view of the character, though, all of her stressing and panicking makes total sense, she had never been left alone by the Doctor before, and he really deserved that slap she threatened him with. 

This was a really good episode, but with a lot of issues and contrivances, but on the whole I enjoyed it a lot, it manged to feel genuinely life or death, and the acting and writing was very good. All in all, I would give it an 8/10.

Our Tenancy Agreement states that the landlord has to give us no less than 48 hours prior written notice before entering our flats, for example to carry out checks and inspections.

Last week they wanted access, but gave only 12 hours’ notice, which I informed them was a violation of article soandso of our Tenancy Agreement. Whether they gained access for the inspection I am unaware as I was at uni at the time. Point being I gave them prior warning they were in violation.

They of course promised not to do it again, but at 17:30 this afternoon I received an email with them stating they require access for another inspection on Wednesday 8th from 9-18, which again is in direct violation of the agreement. 

I have sent them another warning, but since I am a foreigner I am unsure what to do, and for that matter what I can do, if they decide to go ahead despite my warnings.

Everyone lived at all times. It always has to have a happy ending and that is leaking through to the 12th doctor and it must stop.

The makers are trying to put more storylines into one season instead of fewer and better storylines. Kinda making a mess of things with varius plotholes and unanswered stuff. For example the latest episode ""Kill the moon,"" could have been handled much diffirently if put into two episodes, making it a much better story line.

Also, it has been correctly pointed out that my rant is at one point self-contradictory. Reader beware.

So I got to finish watching this one last night after being interrupted by woken up kids the night before. So...

Holy. Crap. I think this one may actually be my number 2 most hated episode in all of Doctor Who. Maybe even my number 1. Say what you will about Love and Monsters, at least I didn't start to hate David Tennant's Doctor at the end of it. Won't know for sure until I finish re-watching the classics. The only saving grace was Clara's well-earned rant at the end.

Regarding science. Yeah, Doctor Who plays fast and loose with the science all the time. But it's generally stuff that we don't know. We know a LOT about the Moon. Claim it's an egg, fine. But don't claim it's 100 million years old. I don't care about the increasing mass thing. Maybe the creature has a trans-dimensional umbilical cord or something. It doesn't matter, because it's a pseudo science aspect of the episode. But you don't screw with the age of something we know has features that are billions of years old. 

How is it that the people making the decisions on Earth are the people who are mostly asleep? Dramatic effect, obviously. But almost exactly as stupid as ""Hey, let's get everybody on the Earth to dial the Doctor at the SAME TIME!"" Almost. 

And then there's the Creatures on the Moon (we should have carried a harpoon). Completely unnecessary, and obviously only included because they didn't have enough material to fill an hour. This episode would have benefited from less monster and more dialogue. I think a 40 minute rant by Clara for his behavior since regeneration would have been better. (Not what I would want to watch. But then, almost anything would have been better than what we got.)

But this is all window dressing. The real problem for me, is that this is the first episode where I've gone from liking Capaldi's doctor to not liking him. Instead of being someone who doesn't get other people and is abrasive because of a certain amount of social cluelessness, he's now callously abrasive and even psychologically abusive. I know the Doctors have been somewhat this way from time to time on a bad day, but this so far defines this Doctor. Up until last week, I had found his behavior oddly endearing.

If the season were to end now, Capaldi's Doctor would be my least favorite of all fourteen. That's right, I disliked this episode so much that I'm allowing Peter Cushing out of the box and temporarily including him in cannon just so I can put Capaldi lower.

It's one episode, and like Love and Monsters before it, I'll hopefully get over it. I've been watching Doctor Who for something like thirty years, and it would take more than a bad season or a Doctor that I didn't like to make me quit. But the quirks of this Doctor are no longer amusing to me.

** Edit **

Ok, it's been half a day and my rage has subsided.

First off, I was debating if I should post in this sub, but I want to get some thoughts from you guys who might have been in this situation before where local laws/financial regs are applicable.

Here is some background:

* I'm 19
* I have a credit card, mobile phone bill, car insurance finance (yay for being young)
* I have a permanent job at a high salary for my age (circa 23,000 p/a, with salary reviews every year)

I'm driving a beaten up old car for the moment. But in around a years time I'm looking to buy a new car (as in brand new, which I will obviously need finance on). My questions arise from gaining credit rating etc.

I looked on Barclay's for a loan (nothing serious, just basic research at this stage), and for a £15000 loan, I can pay back 350 a month over 48 months. This is affordable to me when I take into account my rent, insurance etc.

My question arises from young people and credit ratings. I will not have any issues paying off my credit cards and will not miss payments for my current finance deals etc, how likely is it I will qualify for that rate when I get to that stage in around a year's time?

This is obviously a big loan for someone at age 20, but there is absolutely no doubt I'll be able to pay it back. Is age something that would hold me back? I am already in the ""good"" portion of the chart on experian credit check, and I believe close to excellent, but I've heard stories and myths etc.

Tl;dr will I have a more difficult time getting a fairly large loan because I'm young despite having proof of income, good credit history (at the time that I take out the loan) and a salary that could easily support the loan, even after all other bills are paid?",false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,null,null,default,Questions regarding finance for young people,2,http://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/2ihbxq/questions_regarding_finance_for_young_people/

I'm planning on buying a Honda CG125 and after doing research I believe the best model for me is the one manufactured between the years 2001 and 2003 in Turkey. As it has both a kick starter and electric start. 

I was hunting for a 2001-2003 CG 125 and I've finally found one on eBay. [The CG 125 listing](http://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/321543453230?ru=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebay.co.uk%2Fsch%2Fi.html%3F_from%3DR40%26_sacat%3D0%26_nkw%3D321543453230%26_rdc%3D1) It says the date of first registration was in 2002, but I don't think this is the Honda CG M1 (I'm new to motorcycles) can anybody confirm the model?


On the listing he states there are cosmetic damages (scratches and cracks), from the pictures it seems like the paint has been damaged quite significantly, the cracks near the wheel look really bad too. Can anybody give me any tips on how to repair these things myself or how much it would cost to get it repaired by a professional? 

Also it seems that the general consensus on the internet is that the old CG125s made in Japan (pre 1988) are the most reliable of all models. What do you guys here on MotoUK think?

Is there a certain percentage, or a formula that HR likely uses, particularly in very large organisations? I am working for an American investment bank in London.

Things that make me unsure of what is correct is the fact that the £65k excludes things like annual leave, bank holidays, sick days, and pension. Lastly, is there a floor I should watch out for, say, accept nothing under 50k or so?

I started watching because of Capaldi, and he is awesome, and I know Dr Who can be a quirky  fantasy show, but some of the writing decisions are pretty poor or patronising. 

I've been following this sub reddit since the season started so I'm not saying anything that hasn't been said before: but is it always like this? 

It can still be good and take itself - and the audience - a bit more seriously. 

And it's not just stuff like the mass of the moon, and then something of less mass laying an egg of greater mass, or single celled spiders. 

It's like they go out of their way to make it like a school play. 

Killing germs with a spray? 

One arrow shot at a spaceship. Why didn't they just spend ten minutes coming up with a better explanation? 

Completely wasted dinosaur in the middle of London? Why. 

It's like the people who make the show are *convinced* no one will like it better until it's a bunch of drag Queens winking at the camera and deliberately making the sets shake. 

It feels slightly patronising, slightly worthy, and hamming up Britishness too much. 

I mean I enjoy it, but I'm starting to feel a bit dismayed. 

That's why I stopped after the premiere when cgi bins were eating people. 

Now I've seen clips where it seems very heavy, or romantic or whatever - so is this season particularly stupid, or what?

&gt;I was looking at the injury list on Saturday and our fear was that we had 7 players out injured, so I had to change the team around a little bit, but I wanted to keep the same system. I wanted to keep that diamond because I think it suits our players, as we saw again with our performance.

With Kouyate and Noble on the shelf, a diamond midfield seemed to make a ton of sense. Downing loves being out wide but the diamond gives him the freedom to drop behind the forwards. Amalfitano is the same story on the other side: a winger who willingly drops in behind the forwards.

So what happens to the formation when we get healthy (as Gold said we will be on the 18th, save Carroll)? Surely Kouyate would drop into the hole, but do we put Noble out wide? Do we put him at the top of the diamond? What do we do with Song?

There are some pretty big risks of playing the diamond against attacking teams (one covering two doesn't always add up). Couple that with Noble's lack of speed and I have a hunch we move to a flat four when he and Kouyate are 100%. I don't claim to know more than Sam (though some do), but I just don't see what he said ringing true when we throw Nobes and Cheik back into the mix. Makes more sense to put Noble and Cheik in front of the CBs and Downing/Song in front of the FBs/floating in behind the strikers.

No matter what happens, I am ecstatic with Sam's willingness to adapt to the opponent in front of him this season. It has been amazing what he has done now that we've had a full compliment for him to play with. Lets just hope those old stubborn habits are gone for good.

If there is enough interest, here is what I am thinking:

-We form a team online, designate 3 captains and try to schedule approximate evenings/afternoons where many people would want to play games. The 3 captains would try and expand the team, vote on new members joining or trolls being kicked out of the team. It could end up being 5 captains, just something where a majority of people can vote and a simple majority wins.

-We try and be a competitive, quality team. If there is room in the roster all who want to play should be welcome. But if there is limited room in a game we should have a clear idea of who our best players are and they be given more play time.

-We play using Mourinho's Chelsea formations. That means a 4-2-3-1/4-3-3 hybrid. We should have this custom formation agreed upon by the thread. Basically it's a holding 4-3-3 with Matic as the bottom of a triangle with Oscar and Fabregas in front. Fabregas sits slightly farther back so that he can play long balls and provide defensive cover, but both Oscar and Fabregas are vertical ""shuttlers"" from midfield to the front third and interchangeable. I am over the 4-2-3-1 in FIFA, I vote real life Chelsea playing style.


If this entire idea sounds tedious and lame, OK sorry.


If this sounds good and some DECENT players/people would want to help co-captain we could get this moving. 

UPDATES: So, many of you have pointed out you can't actually do ""Team Play"" and invite friends, the only option to get everyone in the same team is Pro Clubs, where you make your own player, Choose a Chelsea player and make them to the best of your ability Check the roster so we don't have 10 Hazards.

I've been trying really hard to get into this season but I just can't. I quite simply can't care about any of the characters in the show now and the stories are dull and predictable. I don't care in the slightest when a minor character gets killed, I don't care about Clara or Pink, and honestly I don't care about the Doctor either. These feelings aren't really new for me, but this season has made it so much worse. 

Recently I went back and watched all my favourite episodes from the 10th doctor, and in my opinion nothing that the 11th (12th? matt smith) doctor did stood up to the quality of the previous seasons. Episodes like Blink, family of blood, the last of the time lords, Fires of Pompeii, sontaran stratagem, Silence in the library, Midnight and Journey's end. In my opinion all of these episodes are far better than anything since Moffat took over and they even explore similar concepts in a far more interesting manner. Family of Blood is a lot better than the lodger, Blink is far better than the Time of Angels. 

So what happened? Where did the quality go? Where did the interesting characters go? I used to care when a minor character died now I don't. I used to be interested in how the Doctor would solve a problem, now I can take a guess or I simply don't care enough.

My acne was triggered by pregnancy. During my second trimester my face started to break out in painful cystic acne which got worse as my pregnancy progressed. My Doctor assured me that it was hormonal and would go away after the birth. She was wrong. The day after I gave birth my skin was twice as bad and three months later there was no improvement. I tried so many different cleansers, scrubs, masks, over the counter treatments. I have a drawer full of them, nothing worked despite others absolutely swearing by these products.
I was prescribed Zineryt solution but there was minimal improvement so my GP prescribed Lymecycline and hormonal birth control (Marvelon). This seemed to work really well, after 4 months my acne had cleared up nicely and although I was left with some scarring I didn't mind so much because I could cover it easily with make-up and the scars have been gradually fading. I was thrilled.
I stopped taking the Lymecycline about 4 months ago and these past couple of weeks I have realised the acne is coming back. I'm so disappointed. I thought it was over. My GP is happy for me to take Lymecycline again (she suggested three months on, a month off) and doesn't seem to think there are any risks from me using it long term but I'm nervous about taking an antibiotic indefinitely.
Can anyone explain why, since the acne was caused by pregnancy hormones, I still have the acne almost a year after having a baby? I'm not breastfeeding so that's not causing it. 
Is there a solution that doesn't involve taking medication?

*My episode ranking list for S8*

- ""Listen"" - No brainer
- ""Time Heist"" - left 50% to the imagination, so many theories, so many answers, so many unanswered..
- ""Robot of Sherwood"" - I know I will be hated for this, but this truly was a fable, it had that storybook feeling - loved the portrayal of Robin and his chemistry (or lack thereof) with The Doctor - crappy closing though with some lazy writing spread across.
- ""Into the Dalek""
- ""The Caretaker""	
- ""Deep Breath""
- ""Kill The Moon"" - No brainer

It is a few thousand years in the future and the Doctor and Clara are visiting a Casino/Night club on a Comet on the rim of the Milky Way galaxy. A gang of Warlords in large green clunky armour approaches Clara and the Doctor's table and challenges the doctor to a game of Space Poker. The doctor chuckles and accepts as he goes to follows the 3 foot tall men towards into a small room behind the bar. The Barman a 3 eyed alien from the planet of Slobsteru was smoking a large purple cigar in the corner of the bar and was holding a bottle of Whisky. He walked over to the Poker table and poured all a guest a large glass.OPENING TITLES HERE. The games following went for hours and the Doctor won every round. After 5 hours the doctor had earned millions of dollars in weapons and armour. As the doctor offered a round and one more match for all his winnings the men finally snapped. Within moments there large black guns were humming and aimed at the doctors head. 

""Please good sirs, be reasonable"" The doctor said in a cool soothing voice as ZAP the first pulse of electricity from the closes War Lord ripped through the air into the doctor left hand which was resting on his back. The Doctor's right arm darted into his pocket as he bit down on his lip to stop a burst of insults which would end in another burst of electricity. CRACK the chandelier above the tallest Warlords heads fell with a deafening sound and the doctor lept to his feet waving his sonic like a Magic Wand.

""Það er athöfn stríð tíma Drottins"" the shortest one scream as he started to rapid fire his gun. ""What? was that?"" The barman screamed as he ran into the room straight into the smallest warlord. ""I SAID IT WAS AN ACT OF WAR. NOW GET OUT OF MY WAY!!!"" The warlord screamed as the Doctor darted past his Brothers out the door. 

The Dust covered doctor ran onto the dust hall as every eye in the room looked his way. ""EVERYBODY GET OUT NOW...IF YOU WANT TO LIVE!!!!"" he shouted as a 3 headed lady who was doing the tango with her very hairy partner next to the Doctor let out a high pitch scream. The room went into chaos the lights went out and the only sound was footsteps and screams. The Doctor head towards the cleaners cupboard towards and the Tardis. As the doctor flung open the cupboard door and lay his hand on the Tardis door a high pitched booming voice yelled ""COME BACK TIME LORD"" And a laser beam singed the roof over his head. Then without a thought the doctor flung open the Tardis door lept inside and slammed his hands onto the console.

Meanwhile, Clara lay unconscious next to her turned-over table trampled by the head. The remaining people who hadn't escaped were being tied up by the War-Lord who. One of the larger War-Lords slapped Clara across the face and grunted ""færa"" Clara's eyes fluttered open to see the  Tardis slowly teleports. Clara in rage smashes her face back into the ground and knocks herself out.

The hostages are carried back onto the ship and slammed into the Hold. Clara once again was jolted into conciousness as a tall, hansom man started to undo her handcuffs. ""Hello, my lady"" He says slowly in a deep voice as he throws the her handcuffs aside and brushes her hair out of her eyes. Within seconds all memory of Danny was out of her mind and the man charm had activated. ""Hi, Handsome man"" she replies as she slowly gets to her feet and notices the rest of the hostages are in body bags.
""Don't look at them but at me"" He purrs as hit grips Clara's arm. She gives a short flirty laugh which is interrupted as she is pulled into the vortex.

Moments later, the doctor millions of miles away suddenly realises what he has left behind and instantly goes back. The night club was now in runes and nothing was left except for Clara's phone propped up against a wall playing a Vine on loop of one of the Warlords removing his helmet. The same man who was now hitting on Clara saying in his deep attractive voice ""She's Mine now Doctor"". The Doctor shocked picks up the phone and stares at the looped message. ""ARRGH"" The doctor slams the phone onto the ground as a flash of light hits the phones shattered remains and Missy appears sitting on one of the smouldering chairs. ""Hello, Sweety""She winks as she flips her umbrella around in a circle. ""remember me?"" The doctor gasps suddenly ""RIVER, i thought you died?"" ""No Sweety, i was sent to the Nethersphere the place of Mystery and secrets"" ""I see you have lost your friend?""
""Yes, the warlord illt has taken here""
""Well, He has taken her and the goodness inside her soul""
""What, she's not dead is she?""
""No but she is as good as. He has tainted her soul with evil thoughts and now she thinks you don't care for her and you left her here to die. illt has convinced her onto wanting revenge he and his cyberman army are getting prepared to march towards London in the year 2150""
""So all hope is lost?""
""To me yes, I think fish is nice, but then I think that rain is wet, so who am I to judge?""
""Well, I have a duty to save Earth and Clara""

Earth 2150, Illt's Warship hurtling towards the Earth

""Clara, I thank you for sharing my views"" Illt says as he pulls her in for a kiss. They are sitting on the edge of illt red velvet bed and Clara is sitting in a Gold and black dress wearing a crown with a large ruby on the front. ""I thank you for letting me be your queen"" Clara purrs as she goes to kiss Illt as second time. ""Now honey stay here while I prep our troops for battle""Illt stands up and walks out of the room leaving Clara lying on the rug. Clara lips her licks and cringes ""His saliva taste like POISEN"" Clara suddenly starts to cough.

Earth 2150, Street of London.

The Doctor is standing with Missy and talking with Missy as suddenly a large purple vortex opens up and Soldiers one by one start materialising out of it. Seb is leading the pack who walk towards the doctor and is followed by some familiar faces from past series 8 episodes as well as about 50 other soldiers. Seb Salutes the Doctor. ""Sir, I have recruited all the men I can and they are prepared for war""
As Seb finishes his last word a large bang is heard from the sky and Illt's warship comes into view. ""SOLDIERS, RAPID FIRE"" seb shouts as he equipts his gun and runs towards the cyberman who are paragliding down from the ship. The Battle starts to rage Man vs. Machine and it goes long into the night. Civilians bodies littered the street and houses and building lay in pieces. By twelve o'clock both sides had suffered casualties but the Nethersphere soldiers were still out numbered ten to one. There black hole grenades were running short and Illt emerged onto the battle field. Illt was in Glowing Red armour and was riding a Mechanical pony. ""TROOPS CHARGE!!"" Then suddenly all his troops froze and starts running towards the enemy no-matter if they were hurt or not. But The nethersphere army was prepared and they had created a wall of shields. 

Then suddenly out of no-where Fighter planes shot out of the sky bearing the Union Jack and started dropping bombs onto the battle field. Cyberman remains flew high into the sky and littered the battlefield and out of No-where a fight broke out between Seb, Missy and Illt. Illt was starting to fail down before he delivered a fatal blow. Suddenly the hole battle stopped and the hole crowd looked as Missy exploded into a thousand pieces. ""NOOOOoooooo"" Screamed the doctor as he leaned out of the flying tardis's which was flying across the battle field and was about to crashes straight into the Cock pit of Illt's Warship.

Meanwhile Clara, lay screaming as the poisen burnt her insides. ""HELP, ME PLEASE ANYONE"" Then BANG and she looked towards the door as she heard footsteps. Suddenly the door flies open and the dust and ash covered doctor dropped to his knees and grabs Clara's hand. ""Clara, its me the Doctor""
""GO AWAY, you left me to burn and then he saved me and then he betrayed me""
""I CANT TRUST YOU OR ANYBODY""
""Please, Clara remember who I really am""
""No, Illt sayed""
""I DONT CARE WHAT HE SAID TO YOU""
Clara's eyes start to slowly shut.
""I thought you cared for me Doctor but you forgot me and nothing can change that""
""What about Danny than?""
""Tell him, I am sorry for forgetting him and that I regret leaving him to travel with a crazy man""
Then Clara lets out a scream and her eyes close finally.

Meanwhile, in slo-mo Seb delivers the final blow to Illt and he crumples onto the ground and all the Cyber-man suddenly erupt into flames. Then all the soldiers run towards there generals and cheers for him and then it fades out.
Fades into a little rowboat in the middle of a Ocean planet and the Tardis appears on the boat and the doctor walks out of the Tardis carrying Clara and lays her body onto the boat. 

Then the doctor pulls out his Sonic and waves it at  a wheel on the side of the boat and as it starts to turn it a boat a  little Pink boat with flours covering the deck and a bed in the middle emerges out of the sea. The Doctor carefully picks up Clara and lays her on the bed and then retreats onto his row boat. The doctor then lights a match and throws it onto the boat as it starts to drift away and the screen fades as the doctor watches Clara's boat float away burning into the sunrise.

Every Tuesday I'll post between five and ten questions of varying difficulty, sometimes there will be a running theme but not always. Instead of posting the answers for everyone else to see in the comments, please send me a PM! On Thursday I'll reveal the answers as well as the users with the highest score. Feel free to discuss in the comments below as long as you don't give anything away! Of course you could probably google the answers to these in a matter of minutes and there's nothing I can do to stop you but that wouldn't be very fun would it? So I trust you all to answer honestly and without the help of Wikipedia!

1) Last season we matched our previous record for highest finishing position in the Premier League. What season did we previously finish eighth?

2)  After getting relegated from the Premier League, how many seasons did we spend in the Championship before getting relegated to League One?

3) Who scored an 89th minute goal for Southampton to equalise the aggregate score and take the 2007 Championship Play-off to extra time?

4) Who was the last team to play Southampton in a competitive European match? (You've all got no excuses on this one!)

5) Which player had the most appearances for Southampton during our 2011-12 Championship promotion season?

6) How many times has Southampton been relegated from a league since they were founded in 1885?

7) In our return to the Premier League in 2012-13, what was the scoreline and the opponent of our first game?

8) In 2011, Southampton won 6-0 away from home in a League One fixture against which team?

9) Which two Southampton players travelled to Germany to play in the 2006 World Cup?

10) How many different nationalities are there in the Southampton first team squad?

Good luck! Some of these might be a little harder than last week but it wouldn't be fun if you didn't have to think!

It seems this situation is becoming more common as both mortgage lenders and surveyors are trying to limit risk - a surveyor would be liable if it turned out the bank could not sell the property at a later date for the value the surveyor stated.

&gt; (Reuters) - House prices in London are likely to take their first annual fall since the financial crisis next year after soaring nearly 20 percent over the past 12 months, an economics consultancy said on Monday.

&gt; Prices in the capital will decrease by 2.6 percent in 2015, compared with a likely fall of 0.8 percent across Britain, the Centre for Economics and Business Research forecast.

So surely I must be mad to be considering buying right now? What do you guys think? My brother who has bought a few properties reckons I can use this to knock a few grand off any offers but to keep offering because the best time to buy is in a down market (desperate sellers?). But then he's got much bigger balls than me, has basically advised me to borrow the max I can because in a few years you'll never be able to get such big mortgages so now is the last chance to get 'high' on the ladder.

I think it may have only aired for one series or just a few episodes - it seemed to hit several technical problems but I remember thinking that it was a pretty ingenious concept.

I've also tried Turkish Delight and it was pretty bad.


Crunchy tastes like crunchy solid melted marshellows with chocolate coating. Yummy.


Dairy buttons are also good, but they are a bit basic.


Jelly Babies were very good. 


Jaffa Cakes tastes the same as Orange Cookies, but the Jaffa branding is better. Nice packaging.


Hobnobs were fairly basic digestive biscuits.

I've spent the last 4 months travelling Europe and am now looking to settle in London for at least 2 years (working visa allowance) and will look to stay longer if I can find an employer willing to sponsor me.

I have heard some nightmare stories from people that went looking for work via IT recruitment agencies so I'm exploring some other avenues before becoming involved with them.

I spent the last 6 years working in the IT sector for a financial organisation back in Australia.

My Linkedin profile is [here](http://uk.linkedin.com/in/jaseblenner) and my CV can be found [here](https://db.tt/LSicm8AO) - I've removed my phone number, personal email address &amp; home address from my CV as per reddit's rules.

I also have both personal and professional written references from previous managers.

I am currently in Germany finishing up my travels and will be back in London on Monday 13th Oct and would be more than willing to have a sit down over a coffee/beer to discuss any prospective opportunities.

Apologies for the radio silence as of late. It's been pretty manic over here! Lots going on, plus the 'Find A Tech Job In London' meetup last week went really well, and I know I met a couple of redditors from here there, so hopefully everyone that went had a good time.

So, onto an update from me on the recent positions that I'm recruiting for here. The first one is for a senior software developer to join the Now TV team. I'm sure you've seen the adverts around for this service. Essentially it's Sky's answer to Netflix, allowing customers to get their own catered Sky service at a price that suits them. For example, if you just want Sky Movies, for a certain period of time, then that's what Now TV will allow you to do.

You will join a software development team that uses cutting edge technology to provide applications that put Sky first for online content, customer service and sales. 

As a Software Developer you’ll be knowledgeable and passionate about technology, enjoy pairing with other smart people and use agile to ensure your projects succeed. You will have the freedom to promote new and exciting technologies to the development stack. 

Key Responsibilities: 

•Develop excellent quality software using agile techniques such as Test Driven Development and Pair Programming

•Take an active role in Story definition, assisting QAs and business stakeholders with Acceptance criteria

•Drive best technology and software development practices into the team with passion and enthusiasm

•Take a pro-active role with production issues and release management

•Contribute to the technical direction of the team

•Participate in regular showcases of new work to the product owners and business stakeholders

•Strive for continuous improvement within the team


Also, Sky Network Services (the broadband arm of the company) are looking for a CDN Support Engineer to jump on board.

This role is to maintain the delivery of OTT services across the SNS network by providing technical support and business assurance for our internal OTT customers 

Within this role, you will support SNS CDN solutions and 3rd party CDN suppliers. You will work alongside SNS network operational teams ensuring the high availability of Core, Peering and Transit networks. You will work very closely with Project teams to bring new CDN solutions and improvements to OTT delivery and customers experience into operations.
 
We would like you to meet the following criteria:

•Good working server knowledge (Unix + Microsoft)

•A deep understanding of DNS

•Good working TCP/IP protocol knowledge relevant to CDN (HTTP). 

•Working knowledge of Packet analysis software (Wireshark)

•A good understanding of BGP, MPLS, ISIS

•Good Understanding of cache solutions

•Good Understanding of Network monitoring tools / environment.

•Excellent analytical skills

•An awareness of Security Solutions (DOS, IDPs)

•You will be process driven, be extremely customer focused and have excellent attention to detail


As always, I can provide more info with regards to salary and the full job spec if you drop me a PM, and we can take it from there.

Also, get in touch if you want me to see if anything else is going on. 

Cheers,

Tom

I really like Capaldi in general, but I'm finding his episodes to be fairly weak, which makes me think there is something I might be missing.

On rewatching this series so far, a couple of questions were raised. Firstly, how come Orson pink and Danny Pink look exactly the same? Since when do they do that in doctor who? And why didn't the doctor recognise the similarity? He could clearly see a resemblance to his former self in the other teacher Clara was talking to, so why not Danny? 

Next, the space suit. It seems like a very minor detail, but Orsons space suit had the logo for SB6 - this suit dates to tennants era, as the suit he took from sanctuary base 6, which was sucked into a black hole (""the impossible planet"").

At first, I explained this away as he borrowed it from the doctor to get claras attention, but it seems as though Orson is wearing it in the photograph at the start of his voyage... 

There were other things which I'm sure others have noticed, so I'll get to the point. It seems as though Danny is actually quite important. I discussed all of this with some other whovians and we narrowed it down to two possibilties - Danny is either the master, or some incarnation of the doctor.  Now in either case, he would have to be under a chameleon arc, as the doctor would likely notice otherwise, and this would explain why the doctor doesn't really notice him. 

There's supporting evidence for both theories, so I'll go in to more detail here.

Clara goes to the barn and finds a little boy crying in listen, and its widely accepted that this is the doctor.  It ties in nicely with the theory if he is, as it would add further explanation as to why Clara visits this time line - she visits Danny's timeline twice already. Also it ties the soldier to Danny solidly, as there would only be one soldier in existence at a given time - always belonging to the doctor. The only trouble with this is though, is that the doctor wasn't an orphan. He talks about his family.

But we know who is an orphan. the master. So if the child was actually the master, then Clara would be an integral part of his life instead of the doctors. It would set up a huge story arc for Clara, which would account for her recent fall out with the doctor.  The master was referred to in the last ever episode we saw him in as a soldier. The ultimate soldier and the ultimate weapon. Even if the master had returned and was currently human, that must still sting a little, which would explain his outbursts about life as a soldier. 

As you can probably tell, I'm leaning more towards the latter. but I wondered what you guys think?

I know he could just be Danny Pink, but I think it's fun to speculate all the same :)",false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,null,null,self,(Spoilers) My theory on Danny Pink.,47,http://www.reddit.com/r/doctorwho/comments/2ijx4i/spoilers_my_theory_on_danny_pink/

""Hey everyone, hope this might be of interest to some of you.    
This Saturday Glasgow based record label Struggletown Records are putting on their first all day festival. It's 10 bands playing from 3-10pm in Stereo Cafe Bar with everything from Indie, pop rock, emo, pop punk &amp; hardcore and it costs £10 entry. Anyone who is a fan of guitar based music will enjoy this.  

I have nothing to do with this gig, I just think it's an awesome show highlighting some amazing local (+ Canadian) bands and a great place to meet new people and get more involved with the local music scene.

Steven who runs the label also puts on free shows every other month in Bar Bloc, he really does a lot for the Glasgow music scene and I'm so excited to see more people getting involved over the last few years that he's being doing this.

 It would be great to see as many people there as possible and hopefully we'll see more things like this happening around Glasgow in the future.
If you've got nothing to do on Saturday come along, discover new music and make some new friends. Hope to see some of you there!

I suffer from depression and quite bad anxiety, I have been out of work for about 2 years now, and I struggle to do anything. It took me nearly 2 years to get over the anxiety of going to get my haircut, I don't sleep a wink before doctor appointments or anything like that, I worry constantly. It's like a constant battle against myself, that I'm not currently winning.

I'm on ESA, and have been signed off by my doctor. I'm also working with my doctor and a therapist to try and get better.

Yesterday I got a letter through saying I have to attend an ATOS medical assessment at the job centre or my ESA will be stopped, I know this probably doesn't seem like a big deal to most people, but it's sent me off into a spiral of depression and worry. I haven't slept since I got this letter, I've been reading about ATOS and their assessments, and it's made things even worse. I'm worried that these people won't understand mental health issues, and will say what I've heard before from people, that ""just do it"" type attitude that people ignorant about mental health issues always use. 

Why are the government trying to do this? Why is the word of my doctor and a therapist not enough? This is such unnecessary hassle for me, every day is a battle for me, and the government are throwing more obstacles in my way. I honestly don't know what I'll do if my benefits get stopped, I feel like I'm on the right path to getting better, and I've just been pushed off it. 

Is there a place I can discuss things like this with other people in my situation, like a subreddit?  

I just made this subreddit, I think I did it right;

http://www.reddit.com/r/UKbenefits/

I thought maybe we can highlight this sort of stuff and the flaws in the government system, maybe if there's a big enough community something might change, probably not though.

Some of the stuff I've been reading about the way the government are treating people on disability benefits is unreal, I can't believe it hasn't got more mainstream outrage, can someone make a Kony2012-style viral video pointing this shit out? Does nobody care? :(

This guy has been scamming library fundraisers, special needs children, and anyone else he can take for a ride. 

The three current locations for this farce to take place is Hartford CT, Roanoke VA, and the Jacksonville FL event (Was cancelled a month previous to the date and no ticket holders/ticket buyers were informed!)

I love Capaldi's portrayal of the doctor. He is older, harder, and more ""experienced"". This is the change of pace I needed from the overly goofy 11. He is also a great actor in general. Since Claire's introduction, she has been one of my favorite companions, so it is nice having her around still. There have also been some really great moments in this season.

However, I just can't get past the episodes as a whole. They are all over the place tonally, ranging from goofy to serious at the drop of a hat. His characterization also seems to be getting bastardized now as he has willingly let people die without a second of grief, or just outright leave like this weeks episode. I am fine if he is not going to be as remorseful about losses like 11 was, but I would like explanation as to why he had this new outlook. 

There have also been too many episodes written in the template of show us some sort of bad thing happening and then go back in time in the story to see what happened leading up to this. I like this style in moderation, but seeing this format over and over again gets exhausting. What ever happened to building suspense without showing us what we are building to?

These are just my thoughts on the season so far. I am still a fan and look forward to some of the plot points they are building too. I just want to see Capaldi succeed as I really like his portrayal.

  To explain in a little more depth; in the world presented in the episode, the Earth is being slowly ripped apart by the moon, putting the entire human race (and everything else on Earth) at risk of extinction.  
  
  The character of Lundvik is dedicated wholeheartedly to saving the world, at the expense even of her own life and those of her friends. When Clara and the Doctor arrive they pay her little heed other than to argue with her or otherwise ignore or deride her.  
  
  As the truth of the situation appears, she is the only one level-headed enough to reason that one death is rather insignificant in the face of the umpteen billion people alive on Earth who could be killed at any second by the detonating moon.   
  
  Clara eventually sends her signal to ask the entire population of Earth to make the choice, and they do. But regardless, she simply ignores them all because their decision was not the one she wanted. She was willing to not only ignore the will of the entire human race, but risk their very existance based on her feelings.  
  
  It doesn't matter that she was right not to, what she did was reckless, and wrong. In my opinion at least, she made her choice because she was simply in the future, and lacked the direct emotional connection to the planet that the people of that era posessed. She was willing to doom humanity simply because she felt uncomfortable taking a life.  
  
  It would have been a better piece of emotional development for the characters, in my opinion, if they were forced to accept that sometimes even doing the right thing can have an unpleasant cost.  
  
  The episode also demonstrated a further issue that I've been having with this series, and the reboots in general, in that they're becoming less and less about the Doctor himself, and more about the companions.  
  
  I liked Clara at first in this series, but more and more it's becoming that she is the only one fit to make decisions. The Doctor is increasingly sidelined, or put in his place and corrected by her. He is actually completely excluded from the culmination of this episode, leaving Clara and Courtney to play with the fate of the world.  
  
  I really hope that The Doctor will be able to reassert himself in this series, as I'm becoming very tired of the Clara Oswald show.   
  
  On a rather unrelated note, the character of Courtney really bothered me as well; in that whilst she was supposed to be a witty observation on modern teenagers, she didn't actually behave like a human being. She went from being so terrified by the evil space spiders (or whatever they were) that she asked to leave, to being bored and wanting to go on the internet within about two minutes of going back aboard the TARDIS. In this new series there is an ongoing theme that the Doctor does not understand how human beings think, but in this instance it seemed more like the person who doesn't understand human behaviour is Peter Harness.",false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,null,null,self,"So I just got round to watching Kill the Moon, and was very disappointed.",2,http://www.reddit.com/r/doctorwho/comments/2ikos7/so_i_just_got_round_to_watching_kill_the_moon_and/

I've noticed several times people asking for info about what it's like going to City matches etc, so I thought I'd do a little post. 

I'm not sure how many of us who look at this subreddit regularly also attend games regularly, there could be loads, but from the time I've spent on here it doesn't necessarily seem that way as many of us are from other countries or just too far from the stadium to attend regularly. This is no bad thing and it interested me that City's reach is now so great. 

I have been watching City for twenty years and for the past ten years I've been lucky enough to attend between 15 and 30 games a season. Last year was my record, I did 38 matches in total across league and cups including Munich away and Plzen away in Europe.

I'll answer any questions I can about matchday experience, best away grounds to visit, best atmospheres, recommendations...anything you want about watching City.  

Off to play 5-a-side in a bit but if there's any interest in this I'll do as many as I can when I get back and before I go to bed! 

Cheers 

EDIT: Will be going to bed shortly (it's 23.20 GMT and I have work in the morning), but if there are any more tomorrow I'm happy to keep going. 

EDIT 2: As promised, some pictures - I have some from Aris away which I can't find at the moment, once I've dug them out they'll go up as well.

He assumed that there would be a debate with 5 leaders (Con/Lib/Lab/UKIP/Green), but I couldn't see why that would happen. 

I will, for the purposes of this post, ignore Greens - yes, they have an argument for getting in on the debates as they have an MP, but that argument also opens it up to Sinn Fein, SNP, Plaid Cymru etc etc etc. They're also polling somewhere below the Lib Dems which is quite hard work at the moment. 

So, assume it's Dave, Nick and Ed. 

Why would any of them agree to debate Farage? Why elevate him to that level? And, of course, there's also the argument (risk?) that he could win the public over in the debates with his blokey-charm and massive over-simplification of complex issues... but they all try to do that to some extent, Farage is just better at it. 

I just can't see a meeting taking place between any current political leader where Farage being involved in the debate(s) makes sense to any of them. There's just no up-side for them, and the risks are huge. 

The only flip-side I could think of is that if Farage is *not* allowed to debate then there's nothing but wall-to-wall coverage of him calling the other three cowards for weeks afterwards.

I've tried to avoid my own position on this for now, hoping someone comes up with a political/marketing/rational reason for the debates, if they happen at all (I can't see Dave or Nick being particularly keen tbh), including UKIP who are currently polling third.

Shaun from Black Hole Comedy, again. 

Just to let you know that past headliner John Hastings is returning to to record a live improvised comedy podcast - the ""[Anything Can Be A Podcast! Podcast!](http://www.johnhastingscomedy.com/new-podcast/)"" at our venue - The Little Black Box in Redlands next Tuesday.

This is an exciting opportunity to see a master of comedy improvisation crafting something from nothing with no plans, scripts or safety nets. John is a fantastic improviser &amp; comic who has honed his skills both in the UK and his homeland, Canada. He was also recently featured on a BBC Three stand-up showcase so he's good, mind.

I have recently taken on a job with a 30mile motorway commute, each way. I don't own or have access to a car. I can only afford to run either a half decent bike or a potentially dreadful car. I love riding a lot more than driving. 

I'm beginning to find this commute a bit tiresome on my naked Fazer 600. I have an aftermarket screen but no matter how I position it, it's fucking terrible. 

What I'm after is a great all rounder. I want fairing, fun, reasonable mpg. ABS would be great.
Would still like something aesthetically pleasing. I want to wake up each morning, look at it and say 'fuck yeah, let's go!). 

What do people in a similar situation ride, and why would you recommend it? 

Budget probably in the region of £3k when the time comes. 

So far I've been considering the VFR800 VTEC (will request a test ride with Doble when I can), and the GSX650F.

Does anyone have either and recommend?

*Hi everyone! Just wanted to say that I am a big fan of Doctor Who that loves everything about the show! I wanted to start a discussion thread that discussed on what is to come in the season finale of the show.*

 *Please PLEASE don't be afraid to comment/discuss/flame/troll/etc. as I REALLY want any type of feedback. Thank you so much for reading, it took a long time to write. More content will be added later as episodes come out. :) 
PS.* **Tl;dr:** *feel free to* **just skim the bold points** *to get the gist of it. I tried to keep it as structured as I could.. Thank you for your feedback!*
#------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
##[QUESTION: Who is MISSY?]

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;**CONJECTURE:** **Missy is the Rani.** “What?!?! Nooo, she is Clara/Queen of Nethersphere/River Song/ Doctor’s ex-lover/or etc.!” 
&gt;  No. At one point, I thought so too, but after thinking about it for a long time I am 100% convinced that she is that renegade timelord whose last appearance was never really cleared. If you have reason to believe that she is anyone but the Rani, (And I say this very sincerely) feel free to share it with the rest of use Redditors. But until anyone can come up with a theory that explains some of the unanswered questions surrounding the show below, I will stay 99% convinced that she is the Rani. 

•	*“Another major foe will be making a return, but more of that later.”*  These were the words of Moffat in a BBC Interview regarding Season 8. This could be Moffat hinting at the return of the female timelord that was trapped in the time slip in “Dimensions In Time”.  Can’t explain how she got out – I’m assuming Moffat will via Deux ex Machina. 


•	At the end of Episode 1, If you look at the setting of “Heaven” (1:14:58s), **Missy’s Garden strangely resembles exactly what a Tardis Console Room would look like** – with a cylindrical column right where the time rotor should be surrounded by a customizable interior. Maybe?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

##[QUESTION: What's the Promised Land?]

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;**PROPOSITION** – What if, the famous Promised Land that we’ve been hearing all about, isn’t an actual Heaven-after-death but a place where Missy teleports people who are just about ready to die. (and whose death also can’t be prevented/timelocked.. More on that later) 

&gt; There's been many theories making the rounds across the internet of what the Promised Land is. **What if she teleports those who are “as good as dead” and uses them as soldiers/workers/etc. who do all kinds of pawn work for her until their time/usefulness runs out; in which she would teleport them back at the exact moment in which they were going to die.** 



•	Why would this be plausible? If there is one thing I learned from watching shows like the Walking Dead, I learned that you can’t really confirm someone dead unless you have fully watched them die. *Until we see the death being performed on screen, then there is always the possibility that they are still alive.*&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;


•	*EX: We’ve seen an in-show example that supports my thesis in Episode 5 – Time Heist,* as both Psi and Saibra are presumed dead by disintegrators until we find out later that they were just “teleported”. *We’ve also seen this in Episode 2 – Into the Dalek,* when the Doctor teleports Journey Blue into his Tardis moments before her death. (hint hint?) 

#--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

##[QUESTION: Where exactly is the Promised Land?]


&gt; I believe it to be some type of pocket universe or some sort of alternate reality. At the end of The Caretaker [Ep6], the scene between Mr. Security Guard and Seb, we can see the background to resemble a white, office setting with an infinitely long hallway; suggesting the setting’s shape and appearance can be easily manipulated. When Mr. Security takes a peek outside, he is quickly horrified. Perhaps he saw Missy’s army, or the End of the Universe, or perhaps he saw absolute nothingness. Idk. 

**CONCLUSION:**  I’d take a shot in the dark and claim that **the Nethersphere is an artificial planet controlled &amp; manipulated by Missy,** located either at the end of the universe or in a pocket universe ie.like the crack in the wall. It is also used as a dumping ground for all of the “dead” and “robots” Missy collects throughout time and space.

**On a further note, it seems that the Promised Land is being broadcasted to all robots across history as a sort of Utopia, and is being sold as a Heaven to many humans.** It seems very similar to David Tennant’s/The Master’s Arc who (coincidentally) was also at the end of the universe. 


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

##[COROLLARY: What is the intentions behind Missy’s actions?]

&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;  I believe Missy is back to her old ways in experimenting with the course of evolution, though I’m not entirely sure what she is planning to do. 


It’s obvious that she needs humankind somewhere in her plans, but how do the robots fit in her grand scheme?  

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;•	 *[My Strongest theory]* Perhaps, if her intent is to create an ultimate species of some sort, she needs both human and robots to help create a superior race whose features dominate every other species. If you were to design the perfect race, you would want your breed to be the perfect hunter, perfect defender, perfect hider, etc.  of the universe. **Perhaps she can acquire that by gathering the highest-advancements of all of technology (hence the broadcast to robots throughout time of “the Promised Land”) and coupling that with a brain whose creativity and logic drives an endless hunger for perfection..**..Coincidentally, like the cybermen. 

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;•	 [My Not so Favorite Theory] Or Plan B. Perhaps she requires both humans and robots in her quest to manufacture a Time Manipulator; that way she can raise hell across time and screw with the different evolution chains across history. With the power of a +million human brains and all those robots, maybe she could finally create a manipulator.  IDK. 

Tl;dr: She requires both humans and robots as spare parts in creating a perfected cybermen army.  Or B, she’s trying to make a Time Manipulator. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

##[QUESTION: Why is she going through all this trouble to kidnap people? Why wait until the moment they are about to die instead of just swooping in on people at random? ]


&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Perhaps it is to stay hidden.. *Listen,* if there was such a thing as a perfect predator (The Doctor) that hunted down criminals and other injustice things across time and space, what exactly would YOU do to stay alive ‘til the end of time? The Doctor stated that evolution has produced perfect hunters, perfect defense, and the slight possibility of creating perfect hiding. *What if Missy (The Rani) finally perfected the art of disguise?*


&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;How would we know? We wouldn’t, and that would show her mastery of the art. **Let’s assume that the Doctor just has a knack for picking up all cases of paranormal activity eventually.** (just as a perfect predator would) If one were to theoretically hide from the Doctor, you would have a better chance of hiding by camouflaging with the surroundings around you. Missy obviously needs these different humanoid beings for some purpose; however she cannot just grab them at random because she would eventually be found out. (The same reasons her past plans failed.. her abnormalities were caught the Doctor ‘s curiosity) *So what if Missy was to conduct her activities under the radar? How?*


&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; If Missy were to just plop a bunch of different people out of their time era and threw them somewhere else, surely that level of movement would eventually be noticed by the Doctor. **However, what if Missy strategically kidnapped people who were just about ready to die, use them for whatever use she needed, and plopped them back mere moments before that inevitable death.. would that be out of the ordinary?**   Like they always say, a perfect cameo blends in well with its ordinary surroundings.

##Other Unanswered Presuppositions
#-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


•	**Who gave Clara the Doctor's phone number so long ago?**


•	**What the heck is the Doctor drawing on his chalkboard?! (His Math Problem?)**

•	**Why are all these robot ships headed toward the Promised Land? (Ex. [Ep1][Ep3][Ep6])** 

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&gt;   I believe Missy is broadcasting the Promised Land as a sort of Utopia for all robots throughout time. It seems very similar to David Tennant’s/The Master’s Arc when the Master was broadcasting his Utopia til the end of the universe so he could people as parts. 

•	**What happened to Gretchen Carlisle? Did she die and go to Heaven?[Ep2]**

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&gt; I think she did go to Heaven, but didn't die. At least not yet. I think Missy teleported Gretchen seconds before death using her Tardis the same way the Doctor saved Journey Blue with his Tardis. I believe that is how she ended up at the Promised Land.

•	**What’s at the end of the universe? What was Orson so afraid of? [Ep4]**

•	**What did the doctor see at the end of the universe? [Ep4](37:08)**

•	**How did the doctor even get to the end of the universe? Wasn't it time-locked? [Ep4]**

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &gt; ""The Tardis isn’t supposed to come this far but some idiot turned the safeguards off..” 

•	**What was on top of Rupert Pink’s bed? [Ep4]**


&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&gt;  (Missy messing around with time?)

•	**Did the security guard really die to the Skovox? [Ep6]** 

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&gt;  Don’t want to say yes mainly because of my Missy theory. (See above) Also, if you pause the video at the moment in which the hand drops down, (08:32s) *the right index finger appears to be missing on the charred hand.* Would a hell-bent robot of war really go as far as to surgically remove the man’s right index finger with lasers before charring the body as a form of cruel punishment?  HMMM…

•	**Why did Missy look so displeased at the end of episode 6? [Ep6]**

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&gt;  Not saying that this was the only reason, but *perhaps it was because she was angry that the Skovox Blitzer did not blow up and destroy the entire earth,* (which could have yielded Missy 6+billions worth of people) and it only yielded one person – Mr. security guard.

•	**The science behind the whole “the-moon’s-an-egg-that-hatches-a-butterfly-dinosaur” just doesn’t make since does it? [Ep7]**

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&gt;  I can't understand the logic behind this episode. Nothing about it really makes sense. I mean, the dinosaur-butterfly alone practically breaks every rule of Evolution right?!?! …..wait. Shut up. Wasn’t there a major foe back in the old Doctor Who that was obsessed with altering the course of evolution to her pleasing – ie. Saving dinosaurs from extinction? Yeah, I got my money on the Rani screwing around with moon. 
If it's not the Rani, I'm going to be severely disappointed in the next 34 years if this doesn't happen.  

•	**And going back to Season 7, what do people think of that ""Summer Falls"" book written by Amelia Williams? It seems like a long shot but would it be possible if.. idk. [Season 7]**

Nice to meet you, I am /u/DaMan123456 . I mostly stick to anime and what not, but I also love doctor who. Especially the philosophies expressed in the show. I am not religious and what I am going to say here may have already been stated. I looked it up, and found lots of posts on the philosophy on the show. Though I did not find one explaining the trinity that the doctor presents. I am no christen but here is how doctor who has the christen trinity going for it. 

  The doctor is basically the son, he is nearly immortal, and to some extent nearly invincible.  The Tardis is the father (although she is portrayed as a really sexy all knowing women. The tardis (god) sends the doctor (the son) to where he is needed. And the companion is the holy spirit.  Holy enough to travel with the doctor and the tardis. The tardis can be liked to noahs arch in a way. Magic box of god meme applies here.

The second thing I've noticed from the recent episode ""kill the moon"", the doctor states he might, ""regenerate on forever"".  A friend of mine who is Hindu said to me after watching something really cool. Basally in the Hindu philosophies, all of reality is god/Brahma having a dream. My friend said, Brahma can incarnate in his dream (basically lucid dream) and keep living forever! So in essence when Brahma wakes up, everything returns to being the ""void"" once more. If the Doctor is indeed the incarnation of Brahma or the Atman, then the doctor can not die. For if he dies, all of reality will perish with him. 

Anyways that is what me and my friend have been discussing amongs our-self. What do you guys think?

Essentially I've heard various things about this new reform, which is over all good news. But before I utilise this new exception to my advantage I would like some opinions/advice on how much i can fall back on this clause.
See here: http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2014/2356/regulation/5/made[1]

Here is my situation:
I am a musician of various sorts. I like to find weird, and strange sound sources and splice and throw them into the tracks I am making, these includes breaks, vocals, weird noises etc etc (I make breakcore for those familiar with it). Currently I have been releasing my music for free or pay-what-you-want, I have not been charging for my music.

Since this reform has gone through, I am wondering if I can ""get away"" with using samples without consent under the clause of ""pastiche"". From what I have gathered, Pastiche, in a musical setting, takes sounds from sources and other composers to create a new piece of music. With this reform, It looks like I can. But obviously IANAL, so its best if i get advice.

The main reason I am asking is that I am setting up a Record Label (i'm fine legally on that, dw) that may prove to be fairly popular as I have signed a few artists who are very, very well known. And of course at some point I would like to release my OWN music on there.

I am not some massive superstar DJ who nabs peoples work and makes billions, I'm just a small time producer and music student who is just trying to get his name out there.

I've made threads before on here so I don't want to come off as desperate. Suppose ideally I was hoping if any experienced administrators, or people with similar roles could answer me something. It's just with a foundation degree and all the experience around computers and even my unpaid position at a council, I'd have thought companies would respond more but I can apply for hundreds without replies. Yet I know someone on Facebook who's always getting hounded at inconvenient times, and my mum always gets at least one reply if she replies for like, five jobs. I always send a cover letter with my CV too. I don't feel too safe sharing my CV and cover letter online, with my name on it and names of places. So if anyone's willing to advise me, I'll show my CV in private. But I was mainly making this thread to ask if there are any specific Admin courses that are useful and/or impressive to see or that'll make me really stand out. The two people I've mentioned, my mum and my friend, they've both got training courses on their CV, but my mum's was quite expensive and was something she did in a job.

I know I will have to join the supporters club, but can some of the overseas fans who have been in the same position give me some advice on getting a pair of tickets for one game only this year, as I doubt I will be back in the UK again any time soon.

- what level of membership to buy, this will be the only game I will see this year.
- what are my chances of being able to secure a pair of tickets to either Man Utd on Dec 28th or Chelsea jan1 st.
- where in the ground we should try to get tickets for.

The job of a writer/producer is to convey information vital to the story to the viewers in a concise and informative manner. So when you have to go on twitter to explain your view or message online AFTER an episode has run, then you have failed in your job (ie; the angels take manhatten)

THAT'S the problem everyone is having with ""kill the moon."" 

We as an audience are more than  willing to accept the flimsiest timey-wimey excuse for the main problem alot of people have with the episode, it's just that we're never given one in the first place. Some may argue that the doctors list at the beginning was an explanation, but it was only a theory. One was disproven when we learnt of the true purpose of the story. I've read alot of fan generated theories on how it could have happened, and alot of them are good and make perfect sense, but when fans have to make up there own explanations, you've failed in the basic premise of your job as a writer/producer.

The doctor chuckles and accepts as he goes to follows the 3 foot tall men towards into a small room behind the bar. The Barman a 3 eyed alien from the planet of Slobsteru was smoking a large purple cigar in the corner of the bar and was holding a bottle of Whisky. He walked over to the Poker table and poured all a guest a large glass.OPENING TITLES HERE. The games following went for hours and the Doctor won every round. After 5 hours the doctor had earned millions of dollars in weapons and armour. As the doctor offered a round and one more match for all his winnings the men finally snapped. Within moments there large black guns were humming and aimed at the doctors head.

""Please good sirs, be reasonable"" The doctor said in a cool soothing voice as ZAP the first pulse of electricity from the closes War Lord ripped through the air into the doctor left hand which was resting on his back. The Doctor's right arm darted into his pocket as he bit down on his lip to stop a burst of insults which would end in another burst of electricity. CRACK the chandelier above the tallest Warlords heads fell with a deafening sound and the doctor lept to his feet waving his sonic like a Magic Wand.
""Það er athöfn stríð tíma Drottins"" the shortest one scream as he started to rapid fire his gun. ""What? was that?"" The barman screamed as he ran into the room straight into the smallest warlord. ""I SAID IT WAS AN ACT OF WAR. NOW GET OUT OF MY WAY!!!"" The warlord screamed as the Doctor darted past his Brothers out the door.
The Dust covered doctor ran onto the dust hall as every eye in the room looked his way. ""EVERYBODY GET OUT NOW...IF YOU WANT TO LIVE!!!!"" he shouted as a 3 headed lady who was doing the tango with her very hairy partner next to the Doctor let out a high pitch scream. The room went into chaos the lights went out and the only sound was footsteps and screams. The Doctor head towards the cleaners cupboard towards and the Tardis. As the doctor flung open the cupboard door and lay his hand on the Tardis door a high pitched booming voice yelled ""COME BACK TIME LORD"" And a laser beam singed the roof over his head. Then without a thought the doctor flung open the Tardis door lept inside and slammed his hands onto the console.

Meanwhile, Clara lay unconscious next to her turned-over table trampled by the head. The remaining people who hadn't escaped were being tied up by the War-Lord who. One of the larger War-Lords slapped Clara across the face and grunted ""færa"" Clara's eyes fluttered open to see the Tardis slowly teleports. Clara in rage smashes her face back into the ground and knocks herself out.
The hostages are carried back onto the ship and slammed into the Hold. Clara once again was jolted into conciousness as a tall, hansom man started to undo her handcuffs. ""Hello, my lady"" He says slowly in a deep voice as he throws the her handcuffs aside and brushes her hair out of her eyes. Within seconds all memory of Danny was out of her mind and the man charm had activated. ""Hi, Handsome man"" she replies as she slowly gets to her feet and notices the rest of the hostages are in body bags. ""Don't look at them but at me"" He purrs as hit grips Clara's arm. She gives a short flirty laugh which is interrupted as she is pulled into the vortex.

Moments later, the doctor millions of miles away suddenly realises what he has left behind and instantly goes back. The night club was now in runes and nothing was left except for Clara's phone propped up against a wall playing a Vine on loop of one of the Warlords removing his helmet. The same man who was now hitting on Clara saying in his deep attractive voice ""She's Mine now Doctor"". The Doctor shocked picks up the phone and stares at the looped message. ""ARRGH"" The doctor slams the phone onto the ground as a flash of light hits the phones shattered remains and Missy appears sitting on one of the smouldering chairs. ""Hello, Sweety""She winks as she flips her umbrella around in a circle. ""remember me?"" The doctor gasps suddenly ""RIVER, i thought you died?"" ""No Sweety, i was sent to the Nethersphere the place of Mystery and secrets"" ""I see you have lost your friend?"" ""Yes, the warlord illt has taken here"" ""Well, He has taken her and the goodness inside her soul"" ""What, she's not dead is she?"" ""No but she is as good as. He has tainted her soul with evil thoughts and now she thinks you don't care for her and you left her here to die. illt has convinced her onto wanting revenge he and his cyberman army are getting prepared to march towards London in the year 2150"" ""So all hope is lost?"" ""To me yes, I think fish is nice, but then I think that rain is wet, so who am I to judge?"" ""Well, I have a duty to save Earth and Clara""

Earth 2150, Illt's Warship hurtling towards the Earth

""Clara, I thank you for sharing my views"" Illt says as he pulls her in for a kiss. They are sitting on the edge of illt red velvet bed and Clara is sitting in a Gold and black dress wearing a crown with a large ruby on the front. ""I thank you for letting me be your queen"" Clara purrs as she goes to kiss Illt as second time. ""Now honey stay here while I prep our troops for battle""Illt stands up and walks out of the room leaving Clara lying on the rug. Clara lips her licks and cringes ""His saliva taste like POISEN"" Clara suddenly starts to cough.

Earth 2150, Street of London.

The Doctor is standing with Missy and talking with Missy as suddenly a large purple vortex opens up and Soldiers one by one start materialising out of it. Seb is leading the pack who walk towards the doctor and is followed by some familiar faces from past series 8 episodes as well as about 50 other soldiers. Seb Salutes the Doctor. ""Sir, I have recruited all the men I can and they are prepared for war"" As Seb finishes his last word a large bang is heard from the sky and Illt's warship comes into view. ""SOLDIERS, RAPID FIRE"" seb shouts as he equipts his gun and runs towards the cyberman who are paragliding down from the ship. The Battle starts to rage Man vs. Machine and it goes long into the night. 

Civilians bodies littered the street and houses and building lay in pieces. By twelve o'clock both sides had suffered casualties but the Nethersphere soldiers were still out numbered ten to one. There black hole grenades were running short and Illt emerged onto the battle field. Illt was in Glowing Red armour and was riding a Mechanical pony. ""TROOPS CHARGE!!"" Then suddenly all his troops froze and starts running towards the enemy no-matter if they were hurt or not. But The nethersphere army was prepared and they had created a wall of shields.
Then suddenly out of no-where Fighter planes shot out of the sky bearing the Union Jack and started dropping bombs onto the battle field. Cyberman remains flew high into the sky and littered the battlefield and out of No-where a fight broke out between Seb, Missy and Illt. Illt was starting to fail down before he delivered a fatal blow. Suddenly the hole battle stopped and the hole crowd looked as Missy exploded into a thousand pieces. ""NOOOOoooooo"" Screamed the doctor as he leaned out of the flying tardis's which was flying across the battle field and was about to crashes straight into the Cock pit of Illt's Warship.

Meanwhile Clara, lay screaming as the poisen burnt her insides. ""HELP, ME PLEASE ANYONE"" Then BANG and she looked towards the door as she heard footsteps. Suddenly the door flies open and the dust and ash covered doctor dropped to his knees and grabs Clara's hand. ""Clara, its me the Doctor"" ""GO AWAY, you left me to burn and then he saved me and then he betrayed me"" ""I CANT TRUST YOU OR ANYBODY"" ""Please, Clara remember who I really am"" ""No, Illt sayed"" ""I DONT CARE WHAT HE SAID TO YOU"" Clara's eyes start to slowly shut. ""I thought you cared for me Doctor but you forgot me and nothing can change that"" ""What about Danny than?"" ""Tell him, I am sorry for forgetting him and that I regret leaving him to travel with a crazy man"" Then Clara lets out a scream and her eyes close finally.

Meanwhile, in slo-mo Seb delivers the final blow to Illt and he crumples onto the ground and all the Cyber-man suddenly erupt into flames. Then all the soldiers run towards there generals and cheers for him and then it fades out. Fades into a little rowboat in the middle of a Ocean planet and the Tardis appears on the boat and the doctor walks out of the Tardis carrying Clara and lays her body onto the boat.

Then the doctor pulls out his Sonic and waves it at a wheel on the side of the boat and as it starts to turn it a boat a little Pink boat with flours covering the deck and a bed in the middle emerges out of the sea. The Doctor carefully picks up Clara and lays her on the bed and then retreats onto his row boat. The doctor then lights a match and throws it onto the boat as it starts to drift away and the screen fades as the doctor watches Clara's boat float away burning into the sunrise.

Today is the second week of October and I'll be having a brief look at what we were up to way back in 1977. Southampton were in the Second division back then and it was before the points system changed so just 2 points were given for a win. 

---
8th October 1977 - 37 years ago
---
---
The 1977-78 season got off to a reasonable as the Saints took 10 points from their first five games just like our current season. But a 3-0 away to defeat to Millwall and a 3-2 loss to Sheffield United left us lower down in the second division than we would've liked. 

---
**Results prior to 8th October**

Southampton 1-1 Brighton

Stoke 1-0 Southampton

Southampton 1-0 Mansfield

Southampton 3-0 Burnley

Notts County 2-3 Southampton

Millwall 3-0 Southampton

Southampton 1-0 Hull City

Sheffield United 3-2 Southampton

On this day in 1977, Southampton hosted Sunderland and after had the chance to progress to 6th place. [The teams lined up as follows](http://imgur.com/whGURXK), how many names do you remember?

Everything goes as you'd expect until I order a taxi, he gets here a bit early and then goes to leave until I ring him back. Still on time for when I ordered it!!

We are looking for highly ambitious, intelligent and articulate people who want the opportunity to earn a very large amount of money, in a very short period of time. 

A very high level of English language skills and verbal reasoning are a must, although experience of advertising telesales would be of significant benefit, it is not critical as our induction and training program are the best in the industry .

Instead of paying legal fees etc, my dad decided to just give it to me as inheritance when I turned 18, to pay for uni etc.

My dad started his own business and it was slow to start, so I had to lend him £40k to continue to support our family (I'm not really expecting this back, should I be?). I've just started uni in the UK and my savings are paying for everything, course fees, accommodation, living costs + flights back home etc.

I still have about £100k in my savings account back in Hong Kong (family in the UK), but it is only getting something like 0.1% interest, which is standard there at the moment. Therefore I'm looking for ways to not only keep up with inflation but also hopefully secure some extra gains for my future. 

Rough calculations have me spending £25-30k a year. 

Should I just wait until after uni to see what options I have, or invest the money now and keep it earning, liquidating/withdrawing when I need to? E.g investing the money I need for year 4 of my course now, and withdrawing it at a later date?

But then I went to the game on Sunday. My emotions changed from rage in the first half, to bursting out laughing (to the annoyance of the people surrounding me) in the second half. 

It clicked with me when he took the new big bad John off, instead of a wasteful stokes or a lazy commons. This guy is a coach. He isn't a manager, he doesn't have a clue. He can pass on techniques, fitness, and little tips of the game. But tactically, he hasn't a clue. 

4-2-3-1 doesn't work in Scottish football. It's been tried and tested, it doesn't work here. Save it for the euro league. 

His substitutions are reflected in his formation choice. Instead of taking off stokes for griffiths, and changing the shape slightly to accommodate two natural goal scorers (commons and big John), he screws it. 

But the press conference after the game was the cherry on top. ""I'm not worried"". That scared the life out of me. He is so scared to criticize the team after a terrible performance. He did it after legia, maribor, and every game really except the Dundee utd one. 

From managers like Wenger, Ferguson, Lennon, you would be too scared to play badly because of the anger you would receive at the end of the game. Ronny doesn't have that. Hes too laid back. He doesn't seem the type to gain the respect of the players. Hes gotta get mad, and critisize laughable play. He should want to make a mark at the club, but he has failed to do so and is on thing ice. 

Do I think he should be sacked?

No not yet anyway. I'd give him 2-4 more games. If things don't pick up, I won't support him anymore. He needs to expect big performances, and if he doesn't get them, lose the plot.

I never really thought much about it as truth be told I don't know much about dividends, shares etc. But having recently moved house I decided to register with the online share portal so I could change my address. Apparently my shares are worth over £10k. 

I don't really know what this means. I checked google for the company's share price graph, which seems to have gone up and down a fair bit. But once again, I don't really know what this means. 

If I have £10k worth of shares do I have to declare it anywhere I have to declare savings? Does it count as an ISA allowance? Should I keep it where it is, or do something with it?

We're meeting up at 12.30pm at the Alexander Graham Bell on George St. Yes I did write The Standing Order in my previous post because I'm an idiot and mixed them up, but the AGB is only a two minute walk down the same street so hopefully it won't cause anyone massive problems.

They wouldn't allow me to book a table so if someone who likes to be early could say what they plan to wear that day so others can look out for them, I'd appreciate it as I'll be meeting people at the station.

For those coming in by train we're meeting at the station for 12 to then head up to spoons. So far there are three confirmed and two maybes by train. If you would like my phone number so we don't leave you behind, please PM me.

2. Just text. A bit like [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/Gunners/comments/2inr0h/mesut_%C3%B6zil_out_for_1012_weeks_with_a_knee_injury/cl3qr6a).

3. Crests that you can hover over to reveal flair text. Like what we used to have.

4. Tops which you can hover over to reveal flair text. Can't find a good example of this, but you get the point.

5. Three or four, but with the text always showing instead of needing to hover.

Also we are open to other suggestions if you have them. Let us know what sounds good, and we will make it happen.

My partner and I live in a property which is in slight negative equity but on a lifetime tracker mortgage with very favourable rates.  I can't remember the exact percentage, but it is base rate + 0.6% or something.  We have paid off a good bit of the loan already.  The property value is slowly coming back up to what was originally paid for it in 2008 (a silly time to buy, I know).

My question is about mortgage portability.  Could we take this mortgage to a different property?  We are likely to be offered a significantly higher loan than before as our combined salary will be in excess of £150,000 PA when it is time for us to move.

We were formally known as UKGL but we've since moved away from that name to Arrow eSports.
We're using the same sign up system as last year while we put the finishing touches on the website. We've also moved away from forums to running on Skype so each team will need a Skype contact. Because we need the match to be completed in a relatively good time there will be a maximum of 2 matches a week on either sat/sun or wed/thur.

If you wish to sign up you can do so though this link: https://docs.google.com/forms/d/16FRUJu2FnJPqbY8gs54mgSZwABPs3AQpF-kmmKvf8Ao/viewform?usp=send_form 
Sign ups will close on Wednesday 22nd and groups will be released the following day.

We're looking forward to a good season of some inter-uni fun.

Full rules can be found on our forums (goes public tomorrow): https://discourse.arrowesports.com/

I rate the guy, I think he's an ok player, but (to pick the top three):

He's probably the least exciting player in the starting 11,
His work rate is average,
His shooting is below average,

Even with that, I would still pick him in my starting 11.

Is that because we have a gap? Surely not?

""Ho-ho!"" I chortled.  ""That's a bit strange,  isn't it?"" But the links from this 15-year old 20-minute long Comic Relief special to the show we enjoy today don't end there.

Hugh Grant was offered the role of Doctor 9 when Russell T Davies was bringing the show back in 2004. ""That, too, is quite peculiar considering his appearance in this special as the 12th Doctor!  I'm sure this odd sequence of coincidences will be stopping now.""

Then I remembered that Richard E Grant is also tied to Doctor Who through the Shalka Doctor and his recent appearances as the Great Intelligence.  ""This is getting rather spooky now. The BBC employ a vast array of actors, so some overlap is expected,  especially over such a long time as this.""

But the links to the revived show do not begin and conclude with simple actor appearances. As the Hugh Grant Doctor succumbs to a zectronic beam blast, he tells Emma and the Master to look after the universe as he's ""put a lot of work into it."" This is repeated verbatim in the Eleventh Hour as Matt Smith faces off against the Atraxi. ""Well, this is the same writer. I'm sure this pre-reference, or simply ""preference"", is just a one time occurrence.""

Then, as the Master and Emma mourn the loss of the Doctor,  Emma commends him as ""never cruel, and never cowardly"". This line was used again in the 50th anniversary to be the first half of the Doctor's all-important promise he made as he took on his alias of the Doctor. ""This is slightly scary now.

   Ok, here we go. 
#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

##[QUESTION: Who is MISSY?]

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;**CONJECTURE:** **Missy is the Rani.** “What?!?! Nooo, she is Clara/Queen of Nethersphere/River Song/ Doctor’s ex-lover/or etc.!” 
&gt;  No. At one point, I thought so too, but now I am 100% convinced that she is that renegade timelord whose last appearance was never really cleared. If you have reason to believe that she is anyone but the Rani, (And I say this very sincerely) feel free to share it with the rest of us Redditors. But until anyone can come up with a theory that explains most of the unanswered questions surrounding the show below, or can shred any possible inconsistencies in my own, I will remain partial to Missy = Rani. 


-	Going back to what I said before, the status on the Rani was never really resolved.  Her last appearance was in the 1993 charity special, “Dimensions In Time”, in which the Rani planned to trap all the different Doctors in a time loop of perpetuity so that way she could freely reign over the different developmental processes of evolution. However, Sylvester McCoy gained control over Rani’s time tunnel and thwarted Rani’s evil plan, freeing the other doctors while trapping her inside.  However, because there has been so many drastic changes to the timestream since then, (weakening the security of time) it could be possible that the Rani got out.


-	**“Another major foe will be making a return, but more of that later.”** These were the words of Moffat in a BBC Interview regarding Season 8. This could be Moffat hinting at the return of the female timelord that was trapped in the time slip in “Dimensions In Time”.  However, I can’t explain HOW she got out; I’m assuming Moffat will via Deux ex Machina. 


-	At the end of Episode 1, If you look at the setting of “Heaven” (1:14:58s), **Missy’s Garden strangely resembles exactly what a Tardis Console Room would look like** – with a cylindrical column right where the time rotor should be surrounded by a customizable interior. Maybe?


-	The Rani, in the few plots that she was involved in, loved to stay under the Doctor’s radar. Missy’s hush-hush attitude reminds me so much of the way the Rani conducted herself around the doctor. In fact, **my theory of Missy and the Nethersphere is VERY similar to the Rani’s decision in choosing the planet Lakertya for her experiments in “The Time of the Rani”.** (More about “Missy’s Perfect Hiding characteristic”? Ctrl+F “QUESTION: Why”) 



&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; “Lakertya  ..because there’s no evidence that it’s been graced by your meddling presence.” - The Rani 


-	In episode 6, we got introduced to Missy’s rather-friendly secretary - Seb. Just as the Doctor loves to be around his companions, we know that the Rani LOVES having some sort of servant (strangely, of the male-assistant sort) to be involved in her schemes. Seb and Missy’s relationship is very reminiscent to those like the Rani+Josh(Mark of Rani), the Rani+Tetrap(Time of Rani), the Rani+unnamed male assistant (Dimensions of Time). 


I think it’s fair of me to state that correlation is not always (necessarily) causation. Therefore, I’d give the benefit of the doubt that Seb working under Missy is just ‘coincidence’. 



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

##[QUESTION: What is the Promised Land?]

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;**PROPOSITION** – What if, the famous Promised Land that we’ve been hearing all about, isn’t an actual Heaven-after-death but a place where Missy teleports people who are just about ready to die. (and whose death also can’t be prevented/timelocked.. More on that later) 


&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;**After all, she's got a Tardis as well; and we've already seen the Doctor save some people before death via teleportation on a couple occasions, so why wouldn't Missy do it as well? (Ep2:Saving Journey Blue, Ep5:Saving Psi and Saibra, Ep7:Teleporting all the geniuses off the train)**

&gt; There's been many theories making the rounds across the internet of what the Promised Land is. **What if.. She is teleporting those who are “as good as dead” and uses them as soldiers/workers/etc. who do all kinds of pawn work for her until their time/usefulness runs out; in which she would teleport them back at the exact moment in which they were going to die?** 



-	Why would this be plausible? If there is one thing I learned from watching shows like the Walking Dead, I learned that you can’t really confirm someone dead unless you have fully watched them die. *Until we see the death being performed on screen, then there is always the possibility that they are still alive.*&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;


-	*EX: We’ve seen an in-show example that supports my thesis in Episode 5 – Time Heist,* as both Psi and Saibra are presumed dead by disintegrators until we find out later that they were just “teleported”. *We’ve also seen this in Episode 2 – Into the Dalek,* when the Doctor teleports Journey Blue into his Tardis moments before her death. (hint hint?) 

-	Edit:Going off on a tangent right now, but if you pause at a particular scene before Mr. Security gets vaporized in Episode 6.. If we were to zoom on on that right hand, we would notice that an index finger is missing. I hardly believe that a robot decided to surgically remove that index finger milliseconds before vaporizing him with lasers. **Why is Mr. Security's index finger missing?!**

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

##[QUESTION: Why is she going through all this trouble to kidnap people? Why wait until the moment they are about to die instead of just swooping in on people at random? ]


&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Perhaps it is to stay hidden.. **Listen,**(pun INTENDED)  if there was such a thing as a perfect predator (The Doctor) that hunted down criminals and other injustice things across time and space wherever he went, what exactly would YOU do to stay hidden and under his radar ‘til the end of time? Why, what better camouflage is there than blending in with the normal surroundings? (That's right, I'm talking about death..) The Doctor stated that evolution has produced perfect hunters, perfect defense, and the slight possibility of creating perfect hiding. *What if Missy (The Rani), our favorite female, renegade timelord, finally perfected that art of disguise?*


&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;How would we know? We wouldn’t, and that would show her mastery of the art. **Let’s assume that the Doctor just has a knack for picking up all cases of paranormal activity eventually.** (just as a perfect predator would) If one were to theoretically hide from the Doctor, you would have a better chance of hiding by camouflaging with the natural surroundings/occurences around you. Missy obviously needs these different humanoid beings for some purpose; however she cannot just grab them at random because she would eventually be found out. (The same reasons her past plans failed.. her abnormalities were caught by the Doctor ‘s curiosity) *So how would Missy be able to conduct her activities under the radar? How?*


&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; If Missy were to just plop a bunch of different people out of their time era and threw them somewhere else, surely that level of paranormal movement would eventually be noticed by the Doctor. (Which is also why she isn’t just grabbing EVERY human ready to die and only those involved with robot deaths. ) **However, what if Missy strategically kidnapped people who were just about ready to die, use them for whatever use she needed, and plopped them back mere moments before that inevitable death.. would that be out of the ordinary?**   A perfect cameo blends in well with its ordinary surroundings. 


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

##[QUESTION: Where exactly is the Promised Land?]


&gt; I believe it to be some type of pocket universe or some sort of alternate reality. At the end of The Caretaker [Ep6], the scene between Mr. Security Guard and Seb, we can see the background to resemble a white, office setting with an infinitely long hallway; suggesting the setting’s shape and appearance can be easily manipulated. When Mr. Security takes a peek outside, he is quickly horrified. Perhaps he saw Missy’s army, or the End of the Universe, or perhaps he saw absolute nothingness. Idk. 

**CONCLUSION:**  I’d take a shot in the dark and claim that **the Nethersphere is an artificial planet controlled &amp; manipulated completely by Missy,** located either at the end of the universe or in some pocket universe ie.like the other side of the Crack. The Nethersphere is also used as a dumping ground for all of the “dead” and “robots” Missy collects throughout time and space.

**On a further note, it seems that the Promised Land is being broadcasted to all robots across history as a sort of Utopia, and is being sold as a Heaven to many humans.** It seems very similar to David Tennant’s/The Master’s Arc who (coincidentally) was also at the end of the universe. 


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

##[COROLLARY: What is the intentions behind Missy’s actions?]

&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;  I believe Missy is back to her old ways in experimenting with the course of evolution, though I’m not entirely sure what she is planning to do. 


It’s obvious that she needs humankind somewhere in her plans, but how do the robots fit in her grand scheme?  

-	*[My Strongest theory]* Perhaps, if her intent is to create an ultimate species of some sort, she needs both human and robots to help create a superior race whose features dominate every other species. If you were to design the perfect race, you would of course want your breed to be the perfect hunter, perfect defender, perfect hider, etc.  of the entire universe. (Which has always been a fetish for the Rani) 

**Perhaps she can acquire that by gathering the highest-advancements of all of technology** (hence the broadcast to robots throughout time of “the Promised Land”) **and coupling that with a brain whose creativity and logic drives an endless hunger for perfection..**..Coincidentally, [Spoiler](/s ""just like the cybermen."") 

-	[My Not so Favorite Theory] Or Plan B. Perhaps she requires both humans and robots in her quest to manufacture a Time Manipulator; that way she can raise hell across time and screw with the different evolution chains across history. With the power of a +million human brains and all those robots, maybe she could finally create a manipulator.  IDK. 

Tl;dr: She requires both humans and robots as spare parts in creating a perfected cybermen army.  Or B, she’s trying to make a Time Manipulator and somehow both human and robots are involved.

Now the ranty bit:

I was reminded of this by Roy Hodgeson saying about Wayne Rooney ""He will never be able to lecture a room full of people with his Liverpool accent"", we here stuff like this all the time as soon as another English person hears your accent it is ""Better watch my wallet"", if we where not hearing this because of our Location, but because of our colour or religion it would be considered horrific racism, how can we as a city change this perception? Does this annoy others as much as me or am I a bit weird.

I dont mind friends of mine from outside the city joking around I get that, but everyone says it all the time when they meet me and it annoys me, because it must hurt the city for Buissness's, students, people wanting to relocate and Tourism. A friend of mine (from London) was worried about leaving his car out on my street (A very middle class street) and asked my parents if it would be robbed with no twinge of Irony.

The horrible thing is I was born in 1991 most of these stereotypes are from before I was even born the 70's and 80's the city has crime of course but lower than most other cities else in the UK (In 23 years I have never had one committed on me in the city) our unemployment figures and wages are nothing shocking infact in most areas of the City are above average, with no Irony football teams from Middlesborough, Wolverhamton, Birmingham, Sunderland some of the highest unemployment and most socially deprived areas of the land come and sing ""Sign on Sign on"".

This is why I never felt English, I have no love for the country that has no love for our city I will and will always be Scouse, I think we have unique identity that me and most people I know love more than the country, add in strange English loves we never felt like the Monarchy and it always seemed odd I just wanted to see what more people feeling on this where do you feel English if not why not and if so why? And how the city can shed its old Stereotypes and move on and do people think this affects us? Especially with more and more businesses moving out of London we are in a good position to attract them to the city but will old Stereotypes let us down?

#-----------------------------------------------------------------------
##Other Unanswered Presuppositions
#-----------------------------------------------------------------------
##For all things I have yet to tie in with my Missy theory.. Feel free to share your answer any of these below!!

•	**Who gave Clara the Doctor's phone number so long ago?**


•	**What the heck is the Doctor drawing on his chalkboard?! (His Math Problem?)**


•	**Why are all these robot ships headed toward the Promised Land? (Ex. [Ep1][Ep3][Ep6])** 


&gt;   I believe Missy is broadcasting the Promised Land as a sort of Utopia for all robots throughout time. It seems very similar to David Tennant’s/The Master’s Arc when the Master was broadcasting his Utopia til the end of the universe so he could people as parts. 

•	**What happened to Gretchen Carlisle? Did she die and go to Heaven?[Ep2]**

&gt; I think she did go to Heaven, but didn't die. At least not yet. I think Missy teleported Gretchen seconds before death using her Tardis the same way the Doctor saved Journey Blue with his Tardis. I believe that is how she ended up at the Promised Land.

•	**At the end of Robots of Sherwood, -Spoiler- we see the Sheriff of Nottingham coming out of the vat of melted gold suggesting that the Sheriff had turned into a cyborg. Thoughts? [Ep3]**


&gt; In conjunction to my Promised Land theory, I believe we will be seeing our cyborg Sheriff real soon.. ? (Also, it was confirmed by the creators that the Sheriff is a cyborg. In the original version of the episode, there was a scene in which Robin beheaded the Sheriff to reveal him as part robot)

•	**What’s at the end of the universe? What was Orson so afraid of? [Ep4]**


•	**What did the doctor see at the end of the universe? [Ep4](37:08)**


•	**How did the doctor even get to the end of the universe? Wasn't it time-locked? [Ep4]**


 &gt; ""The Tardis isn’t supposed to come this far but some idiot turned the safeguards off..” 

•	**What was on top of Rupert Pink’s bed? [Ep4]**


&gt;  (Missy messing around with time?)

•	**Did the security guard really die to the Skovox? [Ep6]** 

&gt;  Don’t want to say yes mainly because of my Missy theory. (See above) Also, if you pause the video at the moment in which the hand drops down, (08:32s) **the right index finger appears to be missing on the charred hand.** Would a hell-bent robot of war really go as far as to surgically remove the man’s right index finger with lasers before charring the body as a form of cruel punishment?  HMMM…

•	**Why did Missy look so displeased at the end of episode 6? [Ep6]**

&gt;  Not saying that this was the only reason, but **perhaps it was because she was angry that the Skovox Blitzer did not blow up and destroy the entire earth,** (which could have yielded Missy 6+billions worth of people) and it only yielded one person – Mr. security guard.

•	**The science behind the whole “the-moon’s-an-egg-that-hatches-a-butterfly-dinosaur” just doesn’t make since does it? [Ep7]** [Note: My answer works in tandem with Redditor: /u/PureSmoulder Time Rules = Rule 1: ‘Any well known event that occurred in the past of the 21st century is fixed.’ ]

&gt;  I can't understand the logic behind this episode. Nothing about it really makes sense. I mean, the dinosaur-butterfly by itself practically breaks every rule of Evolution right?!?! …..wait. Wasn’t there a major foe back in the old Doctor Who that was obsessed with altering the course of evolution to her pleasing – ie. Saving dinosaurs from extinction? Yeah, I got my money on the Rani screwing around with our moon. 



&gt; I believe that the Rani, whether it was because she finally succeeded in creating a Time Manipulator or some other –Insert Moffatness Here-, rigged our moon to be a dinosaur egg. (Which could explain why this area seemed like such a gray area to the Doctor – because it was new for him as well as it was never supposed to happen!) 



&gt; Using PureSmoulder’s rule above, if any events before the 21st century are fixed, then we can assume that anything that takes place after today is STILL subject to change. Doctor Who has a history of drifting away from actual science, but to claim the moon as a hollow eggshell rather than the terrestrial body with an iron-rich core that we know of today, I call blasphemy!  I strongly believe that there’s something rotten in the state of Doctor Who, and it smells like a mixture between jasmine and Missy. (Although granted, the moon’s insides are still constrained to an extent but to claim a dinosaur is inhabiting inside??)

•	*Going back to Season 7, what do people think of that ""Summer Falls"" book written by Amelia Williams? It seems like a long shot but would it be possible if.. idk. [Season 7]*

He gets people at it, he’s a talker, he takes charge of the dressing-room.

Terry is a throwback in the way he bosses a team. I’ve got a lot of time for John, even though I know his career has not been without controversy. The modern Tony Adams — I can’t pay him a higher compliment than that.

Some people may think John is a dubious role model, but I would have no hesitation in saying to any of the young academy defenders at QPR: ‘Go and watch Chelsea tonight, go and watch Terry, study him all game’.

If they pay attention they will learn more in that 90 minutes than in a month of training sessions.

**UK banks: every underdog has its day**

Could anything be more British than this? A chance to back the plucky underdog against the big, established powers that be. UK banking investors now have a chance to help the new guy in an industry that tipped the UK into recession while also treating customers badly and overpaying staff. So here come the UK’s so-called challenger banks with their IPOs. TSB and OneSavings floated earlier this year, Aldermore is on its roadshow, Virgin Money has just got started, and others are waiting in the wings.


The investment case is all about growth. The challengers plan to take market share from the big four (Barclays, Lloyds, HSBC and RBS) by focusing their efforts. TSB and Virgin are going for consumers. Aldermore is targeting small businesses. Arriving as the economy is recovering, they lack the legacy problems that are costing their bigger rivals billions. There is also political support for competition.


But banking rewards scale – such as coping with growing regulatory costs, for example, and investing in IT. The new boys don’t have scale yet. Cost-to-income ratios at Virgin and TSB are a touch over 70 per cent. At Lloyds (the most UK-centric of the big four) the ratio is 50 per cent. The threat to the investment case, then, is how quickly they can build that scale and at what cost. Bank customers are sticky: only two per cent of current account holders switched banks last year. 

To entice them, the challenger banks might have to offer high deposit rates or low loan rates, or both. That would squeeze net interest margins. So far the challengers are not doing too badly here (Aldermore, for example, makes 3.3 per cent against Lloyds’ 2.4 per cent) but that could change. 

As the challengers attempt to build this scale, either organically or through acquisition, their competitors will be trying to protect their market share. If misconduct issues and demands for more capital tail off, the big four will be able to focus on the Yorkshire terriers yapping at their feet.

Now that is to say, the Doctor isn't the only Time Lord to emit fire during regeneration, but this only seems to happen AFTER the Time War.  
  
River Song's regenerations emit fire, maybe because she is only half-Time Lord?  
  
The Master's regeneration emitted fire, but clearly he wasn't in his right mind, and he had just become a Time Lord again moments earlier.  
  
Another idea I had is, as a Time Lord goes through his regenerations, they become more and more unstable. 7 to 8 (As seen in the 1994 movie) was surrounded by lightning and looked fairly painful, and it could be possible that further regenerations are also painful, as seen in 10 to 11.  
  
And finally, the reason the 11 to 12th Doctor's regeneration was a ""sneeze"" is because the first part of the regeneration was.. Explosive to say the least; Killing several Daleks and even a Dalek ship. After this, the proper regeneration was a ""sneeze"". Could there have been a reset?

I'm no longer enjoying it though, so I'm looking to go to university next year.

However, I feel like it's a massive commitment at the moment; to spend four years studying. I have an expensive hobby (skydiving) which I haven't been really involved with as much as I'd like to recently, mainly because I don't earn a lot. I'd like to go travelling and BASE jumping in the next year or two, so I'm sort of considering just taking one more year out (or quitting my apprenticeship, or both) to work a job to save and then do what I want to do before going to university.

This would mean graduating at 23/24 maybe 25 so if anyone here went to uni later on I'd like to know, could this negatively impact my career prospects? May I struggle at university having been out of education for so long? Would the student finance/tuition fee loans be any different?

I got her about a month ago, so I am assuming she is probably 3 months old, maybe 4 months. I have a cage, cage accessories and food/bedding.

If not, then can you at least tell me if there is a rehoming center in London for small animals or an animal organization center which can take her incase she doesn't sell. Below is her ad and what she looks like.

Given that I don't have long to wait until I can do DAS - the extra ~£350 for the A2 would not be worth it for me and my purposes. I have a good grasp of roadcraft having driven for a few years and I think I would be comfortable riding a route on a test. From what I've heard plenty of others have done it this way and it's worked well for them.

One thing that I am curious about is what the examiners on the Mod2 expect your road positioning to be. I have heard mixed opinions. Some say you should be dead centre in your lane, others say you should take up the ""3-position"" approach depending on the junctions, bends ahead etc (this is what I naturally assume now and feels safer to me) being dynamic depending on what is coming up ahead.

Obviously no over-exaggerated sweeping around corners or being dangerously close to the other lane is a given. Nothing stupid and unsafe, really. I am just concerned that my current stance on road positioning could compromise my chances on Mod2.

Thoughts appreciated in advance!

**Edit:** Seems the [consensus online](http://www.themotorbikeforum.co.uk/viewtopic.php?f=47&amp;t=39746) having widened my google-fu is that middle-lane positioning should be used.

If you hadn't guessed, we are a UK-centric personal finance subreddit. Think /r/personalfinance but with the proper spelling of colour, aluminium, and references to SIPPs, ISAs and OEICs instead of 401ks, the IRS and IRAs.

Almost all posts are welcome here, but you will be swiftly bashed by the ban-hammer if you post any form of self-advertisement, blogspam, SEO-enhancing links, and so on.

#Very important note!: 

The word ""advice"", in relation to personal finances, refers to authorised, regulated advice provided by a professional who has an understanding of your individual circumstances, needs and objectives. **YOU WILL NOT FIND ADVICE HERE**. 

You will find a list of opinions from random people on the internet who really know very little about you. 

Always do your own research, and if in doubt seek the advice of a professional. There are links in the sidebar to sites where you can find a local adviser.

So, I'm considering moving back to Brighton, and would really appreciate any advice you may have. I'll explain first.

I'm currently based in the north, but earlier this year I made the decision to start a new life down there. I had a pretty good time staying with a friend, before the bomb dropped that I couldn't stay anymore. Ultimately I didn't find anywhere, ended up homeless, and returned to my hometown.

A few months have passed now and I'm thinking I'd like to do it again, but more securely. And this is where I'd love some advice. :3

I don't have anyone down there I could stay with, so it'd be a completely new start. And the stumbling block really would be finding somewhere to live. I'm not able to work (I won't go into why), so I know that it'd be housing benefit.

When I was down there before and had short notice to find somewhere, I found that the Brighton area, well, it's nigh-on impossible to find a place to live if you need to claim housing benefit. (Even though I could actually afford to pay a little bit on top.) I was seeking to rent a room, and it wasn't very 'DSS friendly'.

So I guess my first port of call for advice would be, umm, would there be a good place to look, or perhaps area to look for that kind of accommodation? The key is to step up to a secure place to live before I even consider moving.

I keep myself busy with writing, and I guess in an ideal world I'd crash or rent a room with other writing types. It'd be good for productivity. Certainly the main reason I've picked that area is that music writing is my forte, and there's a much better music scene there. But I'm unsure where to find those people, I wasn't down there for long enough to do any research.

But yeah, really, any general advice other than that would be good too. Thank you for any that you may have to offer :)",false,brighton,t5_2qprp,null,null,default,I'm looking to move back to Brighton.

So I want to switch to the Santander 123 current account to get hold of that wonderful 3% interest rate (and the cashback). I'm not a higher rate tax payer and I have over the minimum balance to get the 3%. 

The problem is that Halifax have made it so easy for me to put my money into different savings accounts, so that its simple to keep track of - e.g. an online saver for a holiday, or for a new car, and an ISA to keep long term savings. The current account is then just for day-to-day spending and rent/bills.

With the 123 account I will have to have all my money in one big lump, making it difficult to keep track of short term and long term savings as well as what is needed for rent and bills. It's that much of an issue that I'm actually considering sticking with Halifax. So my question is - how do you guys manage your money in one account, and do you have any tips for keeping track of savings?

Anyway, it's the twenty first century now, and we have internet access, so the other day I thought I would see if there's an explanation online ... I typed my search into google, and the google auto-suggest came up with ''offside rule explained for women'' ... Yes! That's just what I need! So I clicked it, and apparently this has been available for a very long time, but if anyone hasn't seen this, it's rather amusing:

You're in a shoe shop, second in the queue for the till. Behind the shop assistant on the till is a pair of shoes which you have seen and which you must have.

 The female shopper in front of you has seen them also and is eyeing them with desire. Both of you have forgotten your purses.

 It would be rude to push in front of the first woman if you had no money to pay for the shoes.

 The shop assistant remains at the till waiting.

 Your friend is trying on another pair of shoes at the back of the shop and sees your dilemma.

 She prepares to throw her purse to you.

 If she does so, you can catch the purse, then walk round the other shopper and buy the shoes!

 At a pinch she could throw the purse ahead of the other shopper and ""whilst it is in flight"" you could nip around the other shopper, catch the purse and buy the shoes!

 BUT, you must always remember that until the purse has ""actually been thrown"", it would be plain wrong for you to be in front of the other shopper and you would be OFFSIDE!
